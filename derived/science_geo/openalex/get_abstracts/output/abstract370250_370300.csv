https://openalex.org/W2020652110,"Green fluorescent protein and other genetically encodable optical reporters have revolutionized the study of cell function. Now Levskaya et al. describe a technology that adds a new dimension to cell biology by incorporating light-activated proteins from plants into mammalian cell signalling systems, leading to cells whose morphology and behaviour can be controlled by light. The system uses a reversible protein–protein interaction module from the Arabidopsis phytochrome-signalling network to reversibly translocate activators of the Rho-family GTPases to the plasma membrane. In principle, this advance makes it possible to design a variety of light-programmable reagents for a new generation of perturbative cell biology experiments. The use of light to precisely control cellular behaviour is a challenge that has only recently begun to be addressed. Here, a genetically encoded light-control system is demonstrated in mammalian cells. Based on a reversible protein–protein interaction from the phytochrome signalling network of Arabidopsis thaliana, the system is used to reversibly translocate activators of the Rho-family GTPases to the plasma membrane with high temporal and spatial resolution. Genetically encodable optical reporters, such as green fluorescent protein, have revolutionized the observation and measurement of cellular states. However, the inverse challenge of using light to control precisely cellular behaviour has only recently begun to be addressed; semi-synthetic chromophore-tethered receptors1 and naturally occurring channel rhodopsins have been used to perturb directly neuronal networks2,3. The difficulty of engineering light-sensitive proteins remains a significant impediment to the optical control of most cell-biological processes. Here we demonstrate the use of a new genetically encoded light-control system based on an optimized, reversible protein–protein interaction from the phytochrome signalling network of Arabidopsis thaliana. Because protein–protein interactions are one of the most general currencies of cellular information, this system can, in principle, be generically used to control diverse functions. Here we show that this system can be used to translocate target proteins precisely and reversibly to the membrane with micrometre spatial resolution and at the second timescale. We show that light-gated translocation of the upstream activators of Rho-family GTPases, which control the actin cytoskeleton, can be used to precisely reshape and direct the cell morphology of mammalian cells. The light-gated protein–protein interaction that has been optimized here should be useful for the design of diverse light-programmable reagents, potentially enabling a new generation of perturbative, quantitative experiments in cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W1992560794,"Optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) is a wide-field, three-dimensional intravital imaging technique that provides information on the entire tumor vasculature and surrounding tissue microenvironment, allowing visualization of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis during tumor growth and with therapy. Here, Vakoc et al. show that, in contrast to multiphoton microscopy, OFDI can image at greater tissue depths with a wider field of view and without the need for exogenous contrast agents. Intravital multiphoton microscopy has provided powerful mechanistic insights into health and disease and has become a common instrument in the modern biological laboratory. The requisite high numerical aperture and exogenous contrast agents that enable multiphoton microscopy, however, limit the ability to investigate substantial tissue volumes or to probe dynamic changes repeatedly over prolonged periods. Here we introduce optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) as an intravital microscopy that circumvents the technical limitations of multiphoton microscopy and, as a result, provides unprecedented access to previously unexplored, crucial aspects of tissue biology. Using unique OFDI-based approaches and entirely intrinsic mechanisms of contrast, we present rapid and repeated measurements of tumor angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, tissue viability and both vascular and cellular responses to therapy, thereby demonstrating the potential of OFDI to facilitate the exploration of physiological and pathological processes and the evaluation of treatment strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2037156065,"Action potentials in nonmyelinated axons are considered to contribute substantially to activity-dependent brain metabolism. Here we show that fast Na+ current decay and delayed K+ current onset during action potentials in nonmyelinated mossy fibers of the rat hippocampus minimize the overlap of their respective ion fluxes. This results in total Na+ influx and associated energy demand per action potential of only 1.3 times the theoretical minimum, in contrast to the factor of 4 used in previous energy budget calculations for neural activity. Analysis of ionic conductance parameters revealed that the properties of Na+ and K+ channels are matched to make axonal action potentials energy-efficient, minimizing their contribution to activity-dependent metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2155164361,"Efficient delivery of small interfering (si)RNA to specific cell populations in vivo remains a formidable challenge to its successful therapeutic application. We show that siRNA synthetically linked to a CpG oligonucleotide agonist of toll-like receptor (TLR)9 targets and silences genes in TLR9(+) myeloid cells and B cells, both of which are key components of the tumor microenvironment. When a CpG-conjugated siRNA that targets the immune suppressor gene Stat3 is injected in mice either locally at the tumor site or intravenously, it enters tumor-associated dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells. Silencing of Stat3 leads to activation of tumor-associated immune cells and ultimately to potent antitumor immune responses. Our findings demonstrate the potential of TLR agonist-siRNA conjugates for targeted gene silencing coupled with TLR stimulation and immune activation in the tumor microenvironment."

https://openalex.org/W2039055179,"Making Myelin The myelin sheath insulates neurons and facilitates rapid axonal conduction, and its disruption is characteristic of some neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis. Axonal signals stimulate Schwann cells to form myelin in peripheral nerves, but the mechanism is not completely known. By characterizing a mutation identified in zebrafish, Monk et al. (p. 1402 ; see the Perspective by Meijer ) show that Gpr126, a member of the G protein–coupled receptor superfamily, is essential for myelin formation. It appears that Gpr126 acts as a receptor for axonal signals to elevate cAMP levels in Schwann cells and trigger myelination."

https://openalex.org/W2057641163,"Stem cells give rise to differentiated cell types but also preserve their undifferentiated state through cell self-renewal. With the use of transgenic mice, we found that the RNA-binding protein NANOS2 is essential for maintaining spermatogonial stem cells. Lineage-tracing analyses revealed that undifferentiated spermatogonia expressing Nanos2 self-renew and generate the entire spermatogenic cell lineage. Conditional disruption of postnatal Nanos2 depleted spermatogonial stem cell reserves, whereas mouse testes in which Nanos2 had been overexpressed accumulated spermatogonia with undifferentiated, stem cell-like properties. Thus, NANOS2 is a key stem cell regulator that is expressed in self-renewing spermatogonial stem cells and maintains the stem cell state during murine spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1982112078,"Topical application of nicotine, as used in nicotine replacement therapies, causes irritation of the mucosa and skin. This reaction has been attributed to activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in chemosensory neurons. In contrast with this view, we found that the chemosensory cation channel transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) is crucially involved in nicotine-induced irritation. We found that micromolar concentrations of nicotine activated heterologously expressed mouse and human TRPA1. Nicotine acted in a membrane-delimited manner, stabilizing the open state(s) and destabilizing the closed state(s) of the channel. In the presence of the general nAChR blocker hexamethonium, nociceptive neurons showed nicotine-induced responses that were strongly reduced in TRPA1-deficient mice. Finally, TRPA1 mediated the mouse airway constriction reflex to nasal instillation of nicotine. The identification of TRPA1 as a nicotine target suggests that existing models of nicotine-induced irritation should be revised and may facilitate the development of smoking cessation therapies with less adverse effects."

https://openalex.org/W2074766632,"The brain vasculature forms an immense network such that most neural cells are in contact with a microvessel. Here we tested the hypothesis that endothelia lining these vessels can be harnessed to create a cellular reservoir of enzyme replacement therapy to diseased brain. As a model system, we used mice with central nervous system (CNS) deficits due to lysosomal storage disease (LSD mice). The basic premise of this work is that recombinant enzyme expressed in, and secreted from, the vascular endothelia will be endocytosed by underlying neurons and glia, decreasing neuropathology. We screened a phage library in vivo by panning to identify peptides that bound the vascular endothelia in diseased and wild-type mice. Epitopes binding diseased brain were distinct from those panned from normal brain. Moreover, different epitopes were identified in two distinct LSD disease models, implying a unique vascular signature imparted by the disease state. Presentation of these epitopes on the capsid of adeno-associated virus (AAV) expanded the biodistribution of intravenously injected AAV from predominantly liver to include the CNS. Peripheral injection of the epitope-modified AAVs expressing the enzymes lacking in LSD mice reconstituted enzyme activity throughout the brain and improved disease phenotypes in two distinct disease models ( pages 1123–1124 )."
https://openalex.org/W1974237236,"The <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> L. genome contains 58 membrane proteins belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family. Two mitochondrial carrier family members, here named <i>At</i>NDT1 and <i>At</i>NDT2, exhibit high structural similarities to the mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) carrier <i>Sc</i>NDT1 from bakers' yeast. Expression of <i>At</i>NDT1 or <i>At</i>NDT2 restores mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup> transport activity in a yeast mutant lacking <i>Sc</i>NDT. Localization studies with green fluorescent protein fusion proteins provided evidence that <i>At</i>NDT1 resides in chloroplasts, whereas only <i>At</i>NDT2 locates to mitochondria. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli followed by purification, reconstitution in proteoliposomes, and uptake experiments revealed that both carriers exhibit a submillimolar affinity for NAD<sup>+</sup> and transport this compound in a counter-exchange mode. Among various substrates ADP and AMP are the most efficient counter-exchange substrates for NAD<sup>+</sup>. <i>Atndt1</i>- and <i>Atndt2-promoter-GUS</i> plants demonstrate that both genes are strongly expressed in developing tissues and in particular in highly metabolically active cells. The presence of both carriers is discussed with respect to the subcellular localization of <i>de novo</i> NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis in plants and with respect to both the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent metabolic pathways and the redox balance of chloroplasts and mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1982828686,"Miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are widespread in eukaryotic genomes, where they can attain high copy numbers despite a lack of coding capacity. However, little is known about how they originate and amplify. We performed a genome-wide screen of functional interactions between Stowaway MITEs and potential transposases in the rice genome and identified a transpositionally active MITE that possesses key properties that enhance transposition. Although not directly related to its autonomous element, the MITE has less affinity for the transposase than does the autonomous element but lacks a motif repressing transposition in the autonomous element. The MITE contains internal sequences that enhance transposition. These findings suggest that MITEs achieve high transposition activity by scavenging transposases encoded by distantly related and self-restrained autonomous elements."
https://openalex.org/W1976525048,"Fatty acid-induced triacylglycerol synthesis produces triacylglycerol droplets with a protein coat that includes perilipin 3/TIP47 and perilipin 4/S3-12. This study addresses the following two questions. Where do lipid droplets emerge, and how are their coat proteins recruited? We show that perilipin 3- and perilipin 4-coated lipid droplets emerge along the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Blocking membrane trafficking with AlF4− during fatty acid-induced triacylglycerol synthesis drove perilipin 3 to the tubular ER. Forskolin, which like AlF4− activates adenylate cyclase, did not redistribute perilipin 3, but when added together with AlF4− perilipin 3 was recruited to lipid droplets rather than the ER. Thus inhibiting trafficking with AlF4− redistributed perilipin 3 differently under conditions of triacylglycerol synthesis (fatty acid addition) versus hydrolysis (forskolin) suggesting a shared acylglycerol-mediated mechanism. We tested whether diacylglycerol (DG), the immediate precursor of triacylglycerol and its first hydrolytic product, affects the distribution of perilipin 3. Stabilizing DG with the DG lipase inhibitor RHC80267 enhanced the perilipin 3 recruited to lipid droplets and raised DG levels in this fraction. Treating cells with a membrane-permeable DG recruited perilipin 3 to the ER. Stabilizing DG, by blocking its hydrolysis with RHC80267 or its acylation with triacsin C, enhanced recruitment of perilipin 3 to the ER. Expressing the ER enzyme DGAT1, which removes DG by converting it to triacylglycerol, attenuated perilipin 3 DG-induced ER recruitment. Membrane-permeable DG also drove perilipin 4 and 5 onto the ER. Together the data suggest that these lipid droplet proteins are recruited to DG-enriched membranes thereby linking lipid coat proteins to the metabolic state of the cell.

Fat storage has become an area of great interest because as a population we are experiencing significant increases in adiposity and its associated metabolic complications. There is a direct correlation between levels of adiposity and fat accumulation outside adipocytes, which is associated with a vast array of pathologies. However, the mechanisms underlying cellular fat deposition are not well understood. One example of a metabolically important but poorly understood process is how fat gets into intracellular droplets and how the single membrane leaflet of amphipathic proteins and lipids assembles around these droplets. In previous work, we have demonstrated that when cells are given fatty acids they rapidly synthesize triacylglycerol (TG), 2The abbreviations used are: TGtriacylglycerolDGdiacylglycerolPATperilipin, adipophilin, TIP47EPATexchangeable PAT lipid droplet proteinsCPATconstitutive PAT lipid droplet proteinsDGATdiacylglycerol acyltransferaseOAG1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerolGFPgreen fluorescent proteinBATbrown adipose tissueWATwhite adipose tissueERendoplasmic reticulumPKCprotein kinase C. and a set of proteins moves from the cytosol to coat the nascent TG droplets (1Wolins N.E.

These fat coat proteins are members of the PAT family, and the name is an acronym derived from the first letter of the nonsystematic names of the original three family members, Perilipin/ADRP/TIP47 (6Miura S.

Later, two other proteins, S3-12 and OXPAT, were added based on similar sequence and lipid binding behaviors (2Wolins N.E. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bensch K.G. Bickel P.E. J. Biol.

We will use the newly described systematic nomenclature for the PAT proteins (7Kimmel A.R. Brasaemle D.L. McAndrews-Hill M. Sztalryd C. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) as follows: perilipin 1 for perilipin; perilipin 2 for adipophilin/ADRP; perilipin 3 for PP17/TIP47; perilipin 4 for S3-12, and perilipin 5 for MLDP/LSDP5/OXPAT. Unlike some lipid droplet proteins, PAT proteins do not have an ER targeting signal and are not trafficked to lipid droplets through the secretory pathway (8Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Abell B.M. Hahn M. Holbrook L.A. Moloney M.M.

Traffic. 2006; 7: 1254-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). PAT proteins have been described as either constitutively lipid-associated proteins (CPATs) or exchangeable lipid-binding proteins (EPATs) (5Wolins N.E. Brasaemle D.L. Bickel P.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Perilipin 1 and perilipin 2 are CPATs, because they are stabilized by lipid binding, and thus are almost always bound to lipid. Perilipin 3, perilipin 4, and perilipin 5 are EPATs, because they are stable when not bound to lipid, and thus can exchange between the cytosol and lipid droplet based on the metabolic state of the cells. For example, when the lipid surface is expanded by fatty acid-driven TG synthesis, perilipin 3, perilipin 4, and perilipin 5 move from cytosol to the lipid droplet membrane leaflet (5Wolins N.E. Brasaemle D.L. Bickel P.E.

The PAT proteins appear to play an important role in regulating intracellular lipid storage, and CPATs in particular appear to protect lipid stores from unregulated hydrolysis. Studies in cultured cells and whole animals show that CPAT levels control the size of static lipid pools. In addition, a growing set of observations implicates one CPAT, perilipin 1, as the hub of a lipolytic complex in adipocytes (11Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Hlavin E.M. Kimmel A.R. Londos C.

The EPATs, perilipin 3, perilipin 4, and perilipin 5, coat nascent neutral lipid (1Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol.

For example, overexpression of perilipin 5 has been shown to increase TG storage capacity (4Wolins N.E. Quaynor B.K. Skinner J.R. Tzekov A. Croce M.A. Gropler M.C. Varma V. Yao-Borengasser A. Rasouli N. Kern P.A. Finck B.N. Bickel P.E. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3418-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, many important questions remain. These include: from which intracellular structure do the EPAT-coated droplets emerge, and what recruits EPATs to coat the nascent lipid? Coat proteins might share similar functions whether they associate with a lipid-cored droplet or an aqueous-cored vesicle. Aqueous-cored vesicle protein coats have been shown to function in concentrating cargo in the aqueous-cored vesicle and in mediating cargo-rich vesicle budding (13Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Both functions are also required to traffic neutral lipid. A simple model of lipid droplet assembly has been presented in which neutral lipid synthesized in the ER forms a lipid lens that buds into the cytosol (14Murphy D.J. Vance J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This model is based on many observations as follows: the ER is rich in acylation enzymes, particularly neutral lipid synthetic enzymes; most membrane-bound structures emerge from the ER; there is protein traffic between the ER and lipid droplets; and lipoproteins (extracellular neutral lipid-filled particles) emerge from the ER. However, the coat that concentrates the neutral lipid and facilitates budding has not been identified. We previously hypothesized that EPATs are the coat that concentrates neutral lipid into patches in the ER and then buds lipid droplets into the cytosol (5Wolins N.E. Brasaemle D.L. Bickel P.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Overall, the ER coat proteins have been shown to influence the size and number of lipid droplets and trafficking of proteins to lipid droplets (15Beller M. Sztalryd C. Southall N. Bell M. Jäckle H. Auld D.S. Oliver B. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e292Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 16Guo Y. Walther T.C. Rao M. Stuurman N. Goshima G. Terayama K. Wong J.S. Vale R.D. Walter P. Farese R.V.

Skinner J.R. Tzekov A. Park C. Choi K. Bickel P.E. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 450-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These preadipocytes have small lipid droplets as well as large flat processes with defined ER, which makes them suitable for imaging the relationship between these organelles. Using various manipulations to disrupt trafficking and lipid storage, we provide several lines of evidence that EPATs traffic onto the cytosolic leaflet of the ER and that lipid droplets emerge from the ER coated with the EPAT perilipin 3. In addition, our data also suggest that during TG synthesis EPATs are recruited to DG-enriched ER membrane leaflets and under lipolytic conditions they are recruited to DG-enriched lipid droplet membrane leaflets. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) was from Sigma (catalog number O6754) or Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, catalog number 62600).

Cell. 2004; 15: 4512-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) construct with BamHI and NotI. Then this fragment was ligated into the Δ U3 retroviral vector (22Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). OP9 mouse stromal cells, which have the potential to rapidly differentiate into adipocytes, were cultured as described previously (18Wolins N.E. Quaynor B.K. Skinner J.R. Tzekov A. Park C. Choi K. Bickel P.E. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 450-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, these cells were used as preadipocytes in all experiments. To generate stably transfected lines, pseudotyped retroviral particles were produced as described previously (22Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Then viral particles were used to make stable OP9 cell lines. AlF4− was generated by adding 30 mm AlCl3 at 1 μl/ml to media while vortexing and then adding 10 μl/ml 1 m NaF while vortexing (24Wolins N. Bosshart H. Küster H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1735-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Forskolin, RHC80267, membrane-permeable DGs, and staurosporine were added to cell incubations in small aliquots from 1000× stocks in DMSO. Appropriate DMSO controls were included. 30% confluent 150-mm plates of OP9 cells were maintained in media with 100 μm oleate complexed to albumin (four per condition). The cells were washed, scraped, sedimented, resuspended in 800 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES and 1 mm EDTA titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH), and allowed to swell for 10 min. Swollen cells were disrupted by four passes through a 27-gauge needle. To allow the layering of buffer on top of the suspended cell fragments, the resulting homogenate was brought to 10% (w/w) sucrose by the addition of 200 μl of 40% (w/w) sucrose. This sucrose-weighted homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C in a 1700-μl microcentrifuge tube. Then 800 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube, and 700 μl of lysis buffer was layered on top of the sucrose-weighted supernatant. The tubes were centrifuged for 2 h at 21,000 × g at 4 °C. The tubes were then frozen at −80 °C, and the frozen tubes were cut at 300 μl from the top. The floating fraction was collected by transferring the top ∼300-μl piece of ice to a pre-weighed tube, and then the tube was reweighed and brought to 800 mg (800 μl) over the tube weight with lysis buffer. The bottom of the tube was allowed to thaw, and 500 μl was collected from near the pellet to get an undiluted sample of the soluble fraction. The pellets were then resuspended to 800 μl. Cells were disrupted as described under “Fractionation of OP9 Cells” except that one plate of OP9 cells grown in standard media was used per data point, and cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer. The supernatant (800 μl) was then layered on 500 μl of 10% (w/w) sucrose and centrifuged for 1 h at 21,000 × g. The tubes were frozen, and the bottom portions containing the membrane pellets were cut off and thawed, and the sucrose-containing buffer was removed. Then the membrane pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of PAGE sample buffer. Cells were fixed and stained as described previously (2Wolins N.E. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bensch K.G.

Images were captured using a Photometrics Coolsnap cf camera driven by MetaMorph version 6.2r6 software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). 200 μl of each cell fraction was extracted as described previously (25Schwartz D.M. Wolins N.E. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2514-2520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The extracted material was resuspended in hexane/ether (1:1) and spotted on Whatman Partisil LK6D Silica Gel TLC plates. Lipids were resolved in hexane/ether/acetic acid (70:30:1.2), and lipids were stained with molecular iodine. SDS-PAGE, transfer to membranes, and probing of membranes were done as described previously (3Wolins N.E. Quaynor B.K. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bickel P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19146-19155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Membranes were imaged using the LI-COR Odyssey system and infrared fluorescing antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Various observations have led to the longstanding but still unproven notion that lipid droplets emerge from the ER. The availability of specific antibodies to proteins that coat emerging lipid droplets allowed us to test this notion. To determine the site of lipid droplet emergence, we used OP9 cells that express two EPATs, perilipin 3 and perilipin 4. These proteins coat nascent lipid droplets and thus mark the site of lipid droplet emergence. To definitively label the ER, we engineered OP9 cells to retain a GFP-labeled protein in the ER lumen. The ER in these cells forms a clearly visible tubular reticulum at the cell periphery as shown in Fig. 1. To test the hypothesis that lipid droplets emerge from the ER, we drove TG synthesis with fatty acid and then co-imaged the GFP-labeled ER and the EPATs perilipin 3 or perilipin 4. We have previously shown that in OP9 cells and most other cells under standard culture conditions, perilipin 3 is found diffusely throughout the cytosol (1Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 3Wolins N.E. Quaynor B.K. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bickel P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19146-19155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We found (Fig. 1) that under conditions of fatty acid-driven TG synthesis, the EPATs perilipin 3 (Fig. 1A) and perilipin 4 (Fig. 1B) form puncta falling along the tubular ER. In fact, when TG precursors (fatty acids) are added, the EPAT-coated structures are seen alongside ER tubules. The puncta do not overlap with the ER lumen, suggesting they are localized to the cytosolic face of the tubules. These data suggest that during lipid storage EPAT-coated nascent lipid droplets emerge from the ER. We cannot resolve the relationship of ER with lipid droplets in the perinuclear region because of the thickness and dense packing of the ER and lipid droplets in this region. Thus it is not clear if lipid droplet emergence is restricted to a certain region of the ER. We hypothesized that EPATs form the coat that traffics intracellular lipid in a manner similar to the coats that traffic soluble cargo in aqueous-cored vesicles. The use of the G protein inhibitor AlF4− has been useful in dissecting the trafficking of aqueous-cored vesicle transport. AlF4− treatment often blocks the uncoating of vesicles, resulting in the accumulation of coat protein on the membrane from which that vesicle buds (26Finazzi D. Cassel D. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13325-13330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These AlF4−-sensitive vesicles include proteins that mediate trafficking between the ER and lipid droplets (15Beller M. Sztalryd C. Southall N. Bell M. Jäckle H. Auld D.S. Oliver B. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e292Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 16Guo Y. Walther T.C. Rao M. Stuurman N. Goshima G. Terayama K. Wong J.S. Vale R.D. Walter P. Farese R.V.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13325-13330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that AlF4− treatment would reveal the membrane of lipid droplet emergence. We treated cells with AlF4− while driving fat storage with fatty acid supply (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2A in untreated OP9 cells, perilipin 3 is mostly diffuse, and perilipin 3 staining of lipid droplets is rare. Fatty acids alone, as previously shown (compare Fig. 2, A and B), drive perilipin 3 onto lipid droplets (1Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 3Wolins N.E. Quaynor B.K. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bickel P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19146-19155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Treatment with AlF4− in combination with fatty acid caused perilipin 3 in some cells to coat a peripheral reticulum that is reminiscent of smooth ER (Fig. 2C), a staining pattern that was not observed in any of the control cells. AlF4− alone did not appreciably perturb perilipin 3 staining as shown in Fig. 2, D and J. These data suggest that some cytosolic perilipin 3 translocated to a region near the peripheral tubular ER following oleic acid addition in the presence of AlF4−, suggesting that lipid droplets emerge from ER structures. Thus, AlF4− likely revealed an otherwise inconspicuous compartment of perilipin 3 traffic. In addition to blocking vesicular trafficking, AlF4− activates adenylate cyclase and increases cAMP levels (27Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 4888-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Increasing cellular cAMP levels activates TG hydrolysis (28Carey G.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 441: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes drives the EPAT perilipin 4 to lipid droplets (29Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46835-46842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). To test if the AlF4− effect was due to activation of adenylate cyclase, we stimulated the enzyme with forskolin. We found that forskolin alone had no effect on perilipin 3 (Fig. 2J). However in the presence of AlF4−, forskolin drives some perilipin 3 staining onto perilipin 2-coated lipid droplets (Fig. 2, E, H, and J). Fig. 2, E, F, and J, shows that the effect of forskolin/AlF4− is markedly and significantly enhanced by simultaneous addition of the lipase inhibitor RHC80267. This compound is most potent against DG lipases (20Sutherland C.A. Amin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14006-14010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that stabilizing the DG resulting from forskolin-induced lipolysis promotes perilipin 3 recruitment to lipid droplets. In summary AlF4− treatment, under conditions associated with either TG synthesis (oleate) or breakdown (forskolin), caused perilipin 3 to coat either the cytosolic surface of the ER or that of the lipid droplet, respectively. The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, when added alone, does not redistribute perilipin 3 suggesting that increasing cAMP levels is not sufficient to redistribute perilipin 3 in OP9 preadipocytes. The observation that inhibiting DG hydrolysis during TG mobilization enhances perilipin 3 recruitment to lipid droplets suggested a role for DG in the recruitment process. Both fat synthesis and lipolysis share acylglycerol intermediates, most notably DG. Indeed DG is both the immediate precursor to TG and its first hydrolytic product. We therefore examined the possibility that perilipin 3 might be recruited to DG-rich membranes. We tested whether local enrichment in DG might promote perilipin 3 coating of lipid droplets or ER. To directly examine the possibility that perilipin 3 associated with DG-rich membrane leaflets, we treated cells with the AlF4−, forskolin, and DG lipase inhibitor mixture and then fractionated the cells (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3 this treatment generated easily detectable DG from an undetectable level in the lipid droplet fraction. Under the same conditions perilipin 3 was recruited from the cytosol to the lipid droplet fraction. In contrast, the relative contents of membrane and lipid droplet markers did not change; specifically, the ER marker calnexin, perilipin 2, and TG were not altered by the treatment. The demonstration that DG levels are increased on lipid droplets, to which perilipin 3 is recruited, further implicates DG in perilipin 3 recruitment. To further test the hypothesis that perilipin 3 is recruited to DG-rich membrane leaflets, we treated cells with two membrane-permeable DGs, OAG and sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (Fig. 4). OAG caused perilipin 3 to coat the ER as did sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (data not shown). Adding OAG to the cells redistributes perilipin 3 dramatically (Fig. 4C) in a manner different from that observed with oleate addition (Fig. 4B). Furthermore when OAG is stabilized with triacsin C (inhibits acylation slowing OAG conversion to TG) or with RHC80267 (inh"

Here we show using Drosophila melanogaster that a conventional PcG complex can also have a potent tumor suppressor activity. Mutations in any core PRC1 component cause pronounced hyperproliferation of eye imaginal tissue, accompanied by deregulation of epithelial architecture. The mitogenic JAK-STAT pathway is strongly and specifically activated in mutant tissue; activation is driven by transcriptional upregulation of Unpaired (Upd, also known as Outstretched, Os) family ligands. We show here that upd genes are direct targets of PcG-mediated repression in imaginal discs. Ectopic JAK-STAT activity is sufficient to induce overproliferation, whereas reduction of JAK-STAT activity suppresses the PRC1 mutant tumor phenotype. These findings show that PcG proteins can restrict growth directly by silencing mitogenic signaling pathways, shedding light on an epigenetic mechanism underlying tumor suppression."

Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Crowding is not confined to cellular interiors but also occurs in the extracellular matrix of tissues (24Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar) and takes place at membrane surfaces (27Bokvist M. Gröbner G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 14848-14849Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For example, blood plasma contains ∼80 g/liter protein, a concentration sufficient to cause significant crowding effects (24Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Polysaccharides also contribute to crowding, especially in the extracellular matrix of tissues such as collagen (23Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 26Bellotti V. Chiti F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The conversion of PrP from a normal soluble conformation PrPC to its pathogenic conformation PrPSc is believed to occur on the cell surface, in the endocytic vesicles, or in the crowded extracellular matrix (18Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Dorward D.W. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, macromolecular crowding on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix may play an important role in the conformational transition and amyloid formation of PrP in vivo, which have not been fully characterized yet. In vitro, such a crowded environment can be achieved experimentally by adding high concentrations of single or mixed nonspecific crowding agents to the system (23Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 24Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that macromolecular crowding significantly enhances the rate of amyloid formation of α-synuclein (32Uversky V.N. Cooper E.M. Bower K.S. Li J. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 33Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7824-7830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, the role of the crowded physiological environment in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is poorly understood so far. To address the contributions of crowded physiological environments on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, we report here that macromolecular crowding dramatically accelerates fibril formation by human Tau fragment and by human prion protein under physiological conditions. Our results indicate that macromolecular crowding significantly accelerates the nucleation step of fibril formation of human Tau fragment/human prion protein/human α-synuclein by fitting the data to a sigmoidal equation (35Cohlberg J.A. Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1502-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 36Chattopadhyay M. Durazo A. Sohn S.H. Strong C.D. Gralla E.B. Whitelegge J.P. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18663-18668Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, macromolecular crowding causes human prion protein to form short fibrils and nonfibrillar particles with lower conformational stability and higher protease resistance activity, compared with those formed in dilute solutions. The crowding agents, Ficoll 70 and dextran 70, were purchased from Sigma. Heparin (average molecular mass = 6 kDa) and thioflavin T (ThT) were also obtained from Sigma. Guanidine hydrochloride, guanidine thiocyanate (GdnSCN), and trypsin were obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Dithiothreitol (DTT), proteinase K, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Amresco Chemical Co. (Solon, OH). All other chemicals used were made in China and were of analytical grade. The cDNA encoding human Tau fragment Tau-(244–441) was amplified using the plasmid for human Tau40 (kindly provided by Dr. Michel Goedert) as a template. The PCR-amplified Tau-(244–441) was subcloned into pRK172 vector. Recombinant Tau-(244–441) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by SP-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (37Barghorn S. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 299: 35-51PubMed Google Scholar). His-tagged GSK-3β of cDNA was amplified using human GSK-3β plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Thilo Hagen) as a template. The PCR-amplified enzyme was subcloned into pEa vector. Recombinant GSK-3β was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose chromatography sequentially. The cDNA encoding human PrP-(23–231) was constructed into pET30a. Recombinant full-length human prion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified on a Ni-NTA-agarose column as described (38Yin S.M. Zheng Y. Tien P. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 32: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Purified Tau protein and GSK-3β were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with one band. Purified human PrP was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to be a single species with an intact disulfide bond. The concentration of human Tau fragment was determined according to its absorbance at 214 nm with a standard calibration curve drawn by bovine serum albumin, and the concentration of full-length human prion protein was determined by its absorbance at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficient value of 57,995 m−1 cm−1 deduced from the composition of the protein online. A pure recombinant Tau fragment (0.50 mg/ml) was hyperphosphorylated by GSK-3β (20 μg/ml) in the phosphorylation solution containing 2 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm DTT, and 60 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 20 h with a re-addition of ATP and DTT after incubation for 12 h and terminated by heating the reaction solutions at 95 °C for 5 min. The cooled hyperphosphorylated Tau was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove protein aggregates, and the protein was concentrated and stored at −20 °C. A 2.5 mm ThT stock solution was freshly prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and passed through a 0.22-μm pore size filter before use to remove insoluble particles. Under standard conditions, 12 μm Tau-(244–441) was incubated without agitation in the assembly buffer at pH 7.5 (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mm DTT and 20 μm ThT with or without a crowding agent) and at 37 °C for up to 2 h in the presence of fibrillization inducer heparin used in a Tau:heparin molar ratio of 4:1. The fluorescence of ThT was excited at 440 nm with a slit width of 7.5 nm, and the emission was measured at 480 nm with a slit width of 7.5 nm on an LS-55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A similar method was used for the assembly of hyperphosphorylated Tau fragments in the presence of heparin with a Tau:heparin molar ratio of 4:1, except for the addition of 17 mm NaF. The preparation of the samples before the first measurement took 1 min. Under standard conditions, a stock solution of human PrP in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride was diluted to a final concentration of 22,11, or 5.5 μm and incubated at 37 °C in PBS buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 m guanidine hydrochloride and 3 m urea in the absence and presence of different concentrations of crowding agents with continuous shaking at 220 rpm, and samples (50 μl) were diluted into PBS buffer containing 12.5 μm ThT, giving a final volume of 2.5 ml. The fluorescence intensity at 480 nm was averaged over 60 s to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements, and both excitation and emission slits were 5 nm. Control experiments were performed to ensure that the crowding agents had no influence on the ThT binding assays for both human Tau fragments and human PrP. In vitro, GSK-3β hyperphosphorylated human Tau fragment Tau-(244–441), on the one hand, was isolated using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions by 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Protein bands were stained by Coomassie Blue. Gel bands were manually excised, reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. On the other hand, hyperphosphorylated Tau-(244–441) was directly reduced and alkylated in phosphorylation reaction buffer and then digested with trypsin in a molar ratio of 1:50. Hyperphosphorylated Tau-(244–441) peptides obtained by in-solution proteolytic digestion were performed by phosphopeptide enrichment on immobilized metal-affinity chromatography according to available protocols (Pierce). Peptides obtained by proteolytic digestion and immobilized metal-affinity chromatography were separated by reversed-phase chromatography using a TempoTM nano multidimensional liquid chromatography system (Eksigent Technologies) and sequenced by MS/MS using a hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (QTRAP 3200, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in information- dependent acquisition mode. The mass spectral data were searched against a data base containing the sequences of all the human Tau isoforms using the Mascot searching algorithm (Matrix Science). Phosphopeptides and nonphosphorylated peptides of Tau were identified based on the following search criteria: trypsin used with up to two missed cleavages; carbamidomethylation of cysteine in fixed modification; oxidized methionine and phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, or Tyr in variable modification; peptide tolerance 2.0 Da; and MS/MS tolerance to 0.8 Da. Phosphorylated residues were determined by manual inspection of the mass spectral MS/MS data. For selective detection of phosphopeptides from the N terminus of the hyperphosphorylated Tau-(244–441), a list of multiple reaction monitoring transitions of potential phosphopeptides was generated by a software script developed by Applied Biosystems. In general, transitions were included for N-terminal tryptic peptides (maximum of one missed cleavage) containing Ser, Thr, or Tyr residues with either one or two modifications and for doubly and triply charged species for the Q1 mass range 400–1600 m/z. The mass spectrometer was instructed to switch from multiple reaction monitoring to enhanced product ion-scanning mode when an individual multiple reaction monitoring signal exceeded 30 counts. Data were initially analyzed by submitting the MS/MS data to Mascot with a peptide tolerance setting of 0.03 Da. This proves successful as the exact parent mass is known and defined in the multiple reaction monitoring transition. Mascot searches were performed against a data base containing the sequences of all the human Tau isoforms with trypsin plus one missed cleavage, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification, phosphorylated STY and oxidized methionine as a variable modification, and an MS/MS tolerance of 0.8 Da. In addition, data were examined manually. The fluorescence spectra of hydrophobic dye ANS binding were recorded between 400 and 650 nm at 25 °C with excitation at 380 nm (an excitation slit of 5 nm and an emission slit of 6.5 nm) on the LS-55 luminescence spectrometer. Human prion protein samples at various time points during amyloid formation were diluted 10-fold by PBS buffer and then incubated with 100 μm ANS for 15 min at room temperature in the dark before monitoring fluorescence intensity. Assays in the absence of the protein were performed to correct for unbound ANS emission fluorescence intensities. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained by using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with a thermostated cell holder. A quartz cell with a 1-mm light path was used for measurements in the far-UV region. Spectra were recorded from 200 to 250 nm for far-UV CD. The final concentration of human PrP was kept at 13 μm. The averaged spectra of several scans were corrected relative to the buffer blank or the buffer containing crowding agents. Measurements were made at 25 °C. Human PrP fibril samples were prepared in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 0.5% Triton X-100 or without Triton X-100 and heated in water bath for 15 min at 80 °C, cooled down (20Bocharova O.V.

Chem. 2006; 281: 2373-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and then incubated with PK at a PK:PrP molar ratio of 1:1000 to 1:100 for 1 h at 37 °C. After PK digestion, samples were analyzed in 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by silver staining. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting ThT fluorescence intensity versus time to sigmoidal Equation 1 (35Cohlberg J.A. Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L.

The initial base line during the lag time is described by F0. The final base line after the growth phase has ended is described by A + ct. The lag time is the time when the growth in fibrils becomes detectable and is calculated as tm − 2/k. The time-dependent appearance of ThT fluorescence intensity was also found to be well described by the empirical Hill function Equation 2 (34Hatters D.M. Minton A.P. Howlett G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7824-7830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), F(t)=F(∞)(t/t50)n1+(t/t50)n(Eq. 2) where F(∞) is the fluorescence intensity in the long time limit; t50 is the elapsed time when F is equal to one-half of F(∞), and n is a cooperativity parameter. The formation of filaments by human Tau fragment and by human prion protein was confirmed by electron microscopy of negatively stained samples. Sample aliquots of 10 μl were placed on copper grids and left at room temperature for 1–2 min, rinsed twice with H2O, and then stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate for another 1–2 min. The stained samples were examined using an H-8100 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 100 kV or an FEI Morgagni transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Amyloid fibrils, produced from human PrP incubated in the absence and presence of crowding agents (100 or 150 g/liter Ficoll 70) for 12 h, were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in the presence of different concentrations of GdnSCN (0–3.5 m). The concentration of GdnSCN was then adjusted to 0.35 m by the addition of PBS buffer containing 12.5 μm ThT, followed by a ThT binding assay as described earlier. The above amyloid fibrils were also incubated with 2% SDS for 5 min at different temperatures (25–100 °C) and then analyzed in 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie Blue staining. The amino acid sequence of Tau-(244–441) contains two parts as follows: the four repeat microtubule binding domain, which is the core domain related to filament formation; and the C terminus, which has a slight inhibition on the rate and extent of filament formation by the core domain in vitro (19Abraha A. Ghoshal N. Gamblin T.C. Cryns V. Berry R.W. Kuret J. Binder L.I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3737-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Tau-(244–441) consists of the repeat domain forming the core of paired helical filaments in Alzheimer disease and the C terminus containing some pathologically relevant phosphorylation sites by GSK-3β (39Morishima-Kawashima M.

https://openalex.org/W2166074837,"The eukaryotic circadian oscillators consist of autoregulatory negative feedback loops. However, little is known about the role of posttranscriptional regulation of RNA in circadian oscillators. In the Neurospora circadian negative feedback loop, FRQ and FRH form the FFC complex that represses frq transcription. Here, we show that FFC also binds frq RNA and interacts with the exosome to regulate frq RNA decay. Consequently, frq RNA is robustly rhythmic as it is more stable when FRQ levels are low. Silencing of RRP44, the catalytic subunit of the exosome, elevates frq RNA levels and impairs clock function. In addition, rrp44 is a clock-controlled gene and a direct target of the WHITE COLLAR complex, and RRP44 controls the circadian expression of some ccgs. Taken together, these results suggest that FFC and the exosome are part of a posttranscriptional negative feedback loop that regulates frq transcript levels and the circadian output pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1972947623,"Although activating mutations of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) are frequent in bladder tumors, little information is available on their specific effects in urothelial cells or the basis for the observed mutation spectrum. We investigated the phenotypic and signaling consequences of three FGFR3 mutations (S249C, Y375C, and K652E) in immortalized normal human urothelial cells (TERT-NHUC) and mouse fibroblasts (NIH-3T3). In TERT-NHUC, all mutant forms of FGFR3 induced phosphorylation of FRS2alpha and ERK1/2, but not AKT or SRC. PLCgamma1 phosphorylation was only observed in TERT-NHUC expressing the common S249C and Y375C mutations, and not the rare K652E mutation. Cells expressing S249C and Y375C FGFR3 displayed an increased saturation density, related to increased proliferation and viability. This effect was significantly dependent on PLCgamma1 signaling and undetectable in cells expressing K652E FGFR3, which failed to phosphorylate PLCgamma1. In contrast to TERT-NHUC, expression of mutant FGFR3 in NIH-3T3 resulted in phosphorylation of Src and Akt. In addition, all forms of mutant FGFR3 were able to phosphorylate Plcgamma1 and induce morphological transformation, cell proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth. Our results indicate that the effects of mutant FGFR3 are both cell type specific and mutation specific. Mutant FGFR3 may confer a selective advantage in the urothelium by overcoming normal contact inhibition of proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1982596096,"Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, insulin biosynthesis, and beta-cell proliferation and survival. In previous studies GIP was shown to promote beta-cell survival by modulating the activity of multiple signaling modules and regulating gene transcription of pro- and anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family proteins. We have now evaluated the mechanisms by which GIP regulates the dynamic interactions between cytoplasmic bcl-2 family members and the mitochondria in INS-1 cells during apoptosis induced by treatment with staurosporine (STS), an activator of the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. STS induced translocation of bad and bimEL, activation of mitochondrial bax, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, cleavage of caspase-3, and apoptosis. Each response was significantly diminished by GIP. Using selective enzyme inhibitors, overexpression of dominant-negative Akt, and Akt siRNA, it was demonstrated that GIP promoted beta-cell survival via Akt-dependent suppression of p38 MAPK and JNK and that combined inhibition was sufficient to explain the entire pro-survival responses to GIP during STS treatment. This signaling pathway also explained the pro-survival effects of GIP on INS-1 cells exposed to two other promoters of stress: thapsigargin (endoplasmic reticulum stress) and etoposide (genotoxic stress). Importantly, we discovered that GIP suppressed p38 MAPK and JNK via Akt-mediated changes in the phosphorylation state of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 in INS-1 cells and human islets, resulting in inhibition of its activity. Inhibition of apoptosis by GIP is therefore mediated via a key pathway involving Akt-dependent inhibition of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, which subsequently prevents the pro-apoptotic actions of p38 MAPK and JNK."
https://openalex.org/W2044253211,"Anti-cancer chemotherapy can be simultaneously lymphodepleting and immunostimulatory. Pre-clinical models clearly demonstrate that chemotherapy can synergize with immunotherapy, raising the question how the immune system can be mobilized to generate anti-tumor immune responses in the context of chemotherapy.We used a mouse model of malignant mesothelioma, AB1-HA, to investigate T cell-dependent tumor resolution after chemotherapy. Established AB1-HA tumors were cured by a single dose of cyclophosphamide in a CD8 T cell- and NK cell-dependent manner. This treatment was associated with an IFN-alpha/beta response and a profound negative impact on the anti-tumor and total CD8 T cell responses. Despite this negative effect, CD8 T cells were essential for curative responses. The important effector molecules used by the anti-tumor immune response included IFN-gamma and TRAIL. The importance of TRAIL was supported by experiments in nude mice where the lack of functional T cells could be compensated by agonistic anti-TRAIL-receptor (DR5) antibodies.The data support a model in which chemotherapy sensitizes tumor cells for T cell-, and possibly NK cell-, mediated apoptosis. A key role of tumor cell sensitization to immune attack is supported by the role of TRAIL in tumor resolution and explains the paradox of successful CD8 T cell-dependent anti-tumor responses in the absence of CD8 T cell expansion."

Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). The biological outcome of MAPKs is determined by the magnitude and duration of their activation. The activation of MAPKs requires dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues in their activation loop. By dephosphorylating both Thr and Tyr residues, members of the MKP family serve as major negative regulators of MAPK activities. Recently, several MKPs have emerged as important players in both innate and adaptive immune responses through mouse genetic studies. For instance, we previously reported that MKP-5 (DUSP10) regulates innate and adaptive immune responses (2Zhang Y. Blattman J.N. Kennedy N.J. Duong J. Nguyen T. Wang Y. Davis R.J. Greenberg P.D. Flavell R.A. Dong C. Nature. 2004; 430: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In innate immunity, MKP-5 acts as a negative regulator in pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In adaptive immune responses, although MKP-5 is required for naïve CD4+ T cell activation and proliferation, it serves as a negative regulator of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell effector functions. Another MKP family member, PAC1 (DUSP2), has been shown to be a JNK phosphatase, too (3Jeffrey K.L. Brummer T. Rolph M.S. Liu S.M. Callejas N.A. Grumont R.J. Gillieron C. Mackay F. Grey S. Camps M.

Further study using primary MEFs derived from mice lacking MKP-1 demonstrated that this protein is required to inactivate p38 and JNK but not ERK in response to stress (8Wu J.J. Bennett A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16461-16466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, MKP-1-deficient MEFs exhibit reduced cell growth and enhanced cell death compared with wild-type MEFs (8Wu J.J. Bennett A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16461-16466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). More recently, the role of MKP-1 in innate immunity has been studied by multiple groups (9Hammer M.

Moreover, MKP-1-deficient macrophages and DCs produce increased levels of both pro-inflammatory (including tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines. MKP-1-deficient mice exhibit hypersensitivity to lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock (10Zhao Q. Wang X. Nelin L.D. Yao Y. Matta R. Manson M.E. Baliga R.S. Meng X. Smith C.V. Bauer J.A. Chang C.H.

MKP-1 is therefore considered as a crucial negative regulator of the innate immune response (13Liu Y. Shepherd E.G. Nelin L.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). However, the function of MKP-1 in adaptive immune responses remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that MKP-1 KO T cells are defective in T cell activation and proliferation, associated with enhanced JNK activation and reduced nuclear NFATc1 expression. MKP-1 deficiency results in reduced Th1 and Th17 but not Th2 effector function. Consistent with in vitro results, antigen-specific T cells are defective in activation, proliferation, and function in the absence of MKP-1 in vivo. As a consequence, MKP-1 KO mice are resistant to EAE diseases and are impaired in anti-influenza viral infection. Collectively, our results demonstrate that MKP-1 is necessary in the activation of adaptive immune responses. MKP-1 KO mice were provided by Dr. Anton Bennett (Yale University) with the permission of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (8Wu J.J. Bennett A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16461-16466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). OT-I and OT-II TCR transgenic mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All mice were maintained in the animal care facility at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Peptides SIINFEKL, OVA323–339 (ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR), MOG35–55 (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK), NP366–374 (ASNENMETM), PA224–233 (SSLENFRAYV), and NP311–325 (QVYSLIRPNENPAHK) were synthesized by SynBioSci Corp. (Livermore, CA). Phycoerythrin-conjugated MHC class I peptide tetramers specific for NP366–374/Db (DbNP366 tetramer) were generated by the NIAID MHC Tetramer Core Facility. Naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were purified from lymph nodes and spleens of mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on the CD4+CD62LhiCD44lo and CD8+CD62LhiCD44lo surface phenotypes. To analyze the effects of MKP-1 on T cell activation and proliferation, T cells were incubated with different concentrations of plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies. IL-2 production by T cells was measured by ELISA (Pharmingen) 24 h after T cell activation. Cell proliferation was determined 72 h after incubation with [3H]thymidine in the last 8 h. To examine the role of MKP-1 in effector function, naïve CD4+ T cells were cultured under Th1, Th2, or Th17 conditions as described previously (15Angkasekwinai P. Park H. Wang Y.H. Wang Y.H. Chang S.H. Corry D.B. Liu Y.J. Zhu Z. Dong C. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). After 4 days of differentiation, cells were washed and treated with 3 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody for cytokine measurement or treated with PMA and ionomycin (Sigma) in the presence of GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences) for intracellular cytokine staining. For assay of AICD, naïve CD4+ T cells were incubated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 4 days in the presence of 30 units/ml human IL-2. Dead cells were removed using LSM® lymphocyte separation medium (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). Subsequently, cells were reactivated with 3 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody for 48 h. AICD was determined by staining cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (BD Biosciences). Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. For analysis of ERK and p38 activation, naïve CD4+ T cells were activated either with 50 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml ionomycin or with 5 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody with or without 2.5 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody for different times. Cell lysates prepared as described previously (16Nurieva R.I. Duong J. Kishikawa H. Dianzani U. Rojo J.M. Ho I. Flavell R.A. Dong C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-ERK, and anti-phospho-p38 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The signal was detected with ECL reagent (Pierce). For NFATc1 analysis, naïve CD4+ cells were stimulated with 5 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody and 2.5 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody for different times. Nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (17Dong C. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). NFATc1 protein was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-NFATc1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). WT and MKP-1 KO mice were immunized as described (18Zhang Y. Chung Y. Bishop C. Daugherty B. Chute H. Holst P. Kurahara C. Lott F. Sun N. Welcher A.A. Dong C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11695-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with chicken OVA protein (Sigma) emulsified in CFA at the base of the tail. On day 8, the immunized mice were killed, and three mice from each group were analyzed individually for their immune responses. Splenocytes were stimulated with SIINFEKL or OVA323–339 peptide to measure IL-2 production, T cell proliferation, and effector cytokine production. Sera were examined for OVA-specific antibodies. Influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8, H1N1) was purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Mice (6–12 weeks) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with ketamine and infected intranasally with 13 viral hemagglutinating units of PR8 influenza virus. Mice were monitored daily, and weight loss was recorded. Lymphocytes were collected from BAL and lungs as described previously (19Hussell T. Spender L.C. Georgiou A. O'Garra A. Openshaw P.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2447-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To compare NP366–374/Db-specific CD8+ T cells between WT and KO mice, phycoerythrin-conjugated DbNP366 tetramer staining was performed for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD8 antibody at 4 °C. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc.). To analyze influenza virus-specific T cell responses, leukocytes from BAL and lungs were activated with 20 ng/ml PA224–233 or 20 μg/ml NP311–325 overnight, respectively. GolgiPlug was added during the last 6 h of incubation. Cells were permeabilized with a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) and analyzed for the expression of IFNγ in CD4+ and CD8+ cells. The culture supernatant was collected. IFNγ concentration was determined by ELISA. EAE was induced in WT and MKP-1 KO mice with MOG35–55 peptide as we described previously (20Dong C. Juedes A.E. Temann U.A. Shresta S. Allison J.P. Ruddle N.H. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were immunized twice with the peptide in CFA, followed by two subsequent treatments with pertussis toxin 1 day after each immunization. The mice were observed daily for clinical signs and scored on a scale of 0–5 with gradations of 0.5 for intermediate scores: 0, no clinical signs; 1, loss of tail tone; 2, wobbly gait; 3, hind limb paralysis; 4, hind limb and forelimb paralysis; 5, death. Preparation and stimulation of mononuclear cells from brain and spinal tissues were done as described (20Dong C. Juedes A.E. Temann U.A. Shresta S. Allison J.P. Ruddle N.H. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Cells from lymph nodes and spleens of WT and MKP-1 KO mice were incubated with anti-CD4 microbeads, and CD4+ T cells were purified by an autoMACS sorter (Mitenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). 5 × 106 cells were injected in the tail veins of Rag1−/− recipient mice. After 24 h, Rag1−/− recipients were used for EAE induction and analysis as described above. Statistical analysis was calculated with an unpaired Mann-Whitney test and STATISTICA software (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK). p values ≤0.05 were considered significant. MAPKs have previously been shown to regulate T cell development (21Fischer A.M. Katayama C.D. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 2005; 23: 431-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). When we examined different thymocyte subpopulations, no difference in their percentages were detected in WT and MKP-1 KO mice (supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, the ratios of CD4+ and CD8+ mature T cells in the spleens and lymph nodes from WT and KO mice were comparable (supplemental Fig. S1). Although we have not examined the repertoire of TCR in peripheral T cells, MKP-1 appears to be dispensable for T cell development. It is possible that a deficiency of MKP-1 in T cell development can be compensated by other MKP family members. To investigate the possible roles of MKP-1 in T cell responses, we first examined its mRNA expression in naïve CD4+ T cells and effector Th cells, including Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. MKP-1 was highly expressed in naïve CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1A). Its expression was dramatically down-regulated after 3 h of anti-CD3 stimulation. MKP-1 expression was observed in all effector Th subsets, with the highest expression in Th1 cells and the lowest expression in Th17 cells (Fig. 1A). To examine the function of MKP-1 in T cells, we first assayed MAPK activation in WT and MKP-1 KO CD4+ T cells in response to PMA and ionomycin activation. As shown in Fig. 1B, the activation of JNK in both WT and MKP-1 KO cells was induced after 15 min of PMA and ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 1B). However, MKP-1 KO cells had enhanced activation of p46 JNK isoforms at 15 and 45 min and of p54 JNK at 15 and 30 min after PMA and ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 1B), indicating that MKP-1 is a negative regulator of JNK in CD4+ T cells. ERK activation in naïve CD4+ T cells from both WT and KO mice was undetectable without stimulation but was induced after 15 min of stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. The activation of ERK in both WT and KO cells exhibited similar kinetics; however, enhanced ERK activation in MKP-1 KO cells was detected at 15 min after PMA and ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 1B), indicating that MKP-1 might serve as a negative regulator of ERK in CD4+ T cells. Unlike ERK and JNK, the activation of p38 in MKP-1 KO CD4+ T cells was reduced compared with that in WT cells after 15 min of PMA and ionomycin activation (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained with WT and MKP-1 KO CD4+ T cells after TCR activation (data not shown). Therefore, in T cells, MKP-1 is a negative regulator of JNK and perhaps ERK but not p38. To examine the role of MKP-1 in CD4+ T cell activation and proliferation, WT and MKP-1 KO naïve CD4+ T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody with or without anti-CD28 antibody. IL-2 concentration in the culture supernatant was determined by ELISA. We found that upon stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody alone or with anti-CD28 antibody, the production of IL-2 by MKP-1 KO CD4+ T cells was substantially lower than that by WT cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, MKP-1 KO CD4+ T cells exhibited impaired proliferation compared with WT cells. Similarly, we found that MKP-1 KO CD8+ T cells also produced lower levels of IL-2 and exhibited greatly reduced proliferative responses compared with WT cells in response to stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody alone or with anti-CD28 antibody (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that MKP-1 is required for T cell activation and proliferation. TCR and CD28 signaling leads to the induction and activation of several transcription factors that regulate T cell activation and proliferation. Among them, members of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) family play important roles in peripheral T cell activation and effector function (22Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar, 23Yoshida H. Nishina H. Takimoto H. Marengère L.E. Wakeham A.C. Bouchard D. Kong Y.Y. Ohteki T. Shahinian A. Bachmann M. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. Crabtree G.R. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1998; 8: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We have shown that the nuclear accumulation of NFATc1, an essential step for its function, is negatively regulated by JNK1 (17Dong C. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and that JNK1 directly phosphorylates NFATc1 (24Chow C.W. Dong C. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5227-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To examine the regulation of NFATc1 by MKP-1, we examined NFATc1 protein expression in the nuclei of WT and KO CD4+ T cells after anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation. We found that the nuclear accumulation of multiple isoforms of NFATc1 proteins, which are generated from alternative splicing (22Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar), was greatly increased in WT cells after 2 h of stimulation (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the nuclear accumulation of NFATc1 in KO cells was minimal, indicating that MKP-1 is required for NFATc1 nuclear translocation in response to TCR and CD28 activation. Because NFATc1 is required in T cell proliferation (23Yoshida H. Nishina H. Takimoto H. Marengère L.E. Wakeham A.C. Bouchard D. Kong Y.Y. Ohteki T. Shahinian A. Bachmann M. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M.

Alt F.W. de la Brousse F.C. Hoey T. Grusby M. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), greatly reduced NFATc1 nuclear accumulation in MKP-1-deficient cells is likely the underlying reason for their poor proliferation. Previously, we reported that JNK1-deficient T cells exhibit increased proliferation associated with reduced AICD (17Dong C. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To investigate the regulation of AICD by MKP-1, WT and MKP-1 KO CD4+ T cells activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies were restimulated with anti-CD3 antibody to induce apoptosis. We found that whereas ∼30% of WT cells underwent apoptosis, >60% of KO cells did (supplemental Fig. S2). KO cells contained ∼5 times more single annexin V-positive cells (early apoptotic cells) and 2 times more propidium iodide-positive annexin V-positive cells (late apoptotic cells) compared with WT cells (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that MKP-1 is a negative regulator of AICD in CD4+ T cells. Upon activation, naïve CD4+ T cells differentiate into different lineages of effector cells, such as Th1, Th2, and Th17. To study the role of MKP-1 in the regulation of Th cell differentiation and function, WT and MKP-1 KO naïve CD4+ T cells were cultured under Th1, Th2, or Th17 conditions in vitro with exogenous IL-2 to normalize their proliferation. After 4 days of differentiation, effector Th cells were restimulated with anti-CD3 antibody to examine the secretion of lineage-specific cytokines by ELISA. We found that both MKP-1 KO Th1 and Th17 cells produced significantly reduced amounts of IFNγ and IL-17, respectively, whereas MKP-1 KO Th2 cells produced similar amounts of IL-4 compared with WT cells (Fig. 2, D–F). We further confirmed these observations by intracellular cytokine staining. KO naïve CD4+ T cells differentiated under both Th1 and Th17 conditions had lower percentages of IFNγ- and IL-17-producing cells, respectively, compared with WT cells (Fig. 2, D and F). On the other hand, both WT and MKP-1 KO T cells exhibited similar percentages of IL-4-producing cells when differentiated under Th2 conditions (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrated that MKP-1 is required for Th1 and Th17 differentiation and function. Similar to CD4+ T cells, naïve CD8+ T cells, in response to TCR-mediated activation, differentiate into effector CD8+ T cells that acquire effector functions, including IFNγ and tumor necrosis factor-α cytokine production. To investigate the role of MKP-1 in CD8+ T cell effector function, WT and MKP-1 KO effector CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro in the presence of exogenous IL-2 before restimulation with anti-CD3 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2G, MKP-1 deficiency resulted in a profound defect in CD8+ T cell effector cytokine production, indicating that MKP-1 is a critical regulator of CD8+ T cell effector function. Together, these results demonstrated that MKP-1 is required for T cell activation and proliferation and T cell effector function. To investigate the regulation of antigen-specific T cell responses by MKP-1 in vivo, both WT and MKP-1 KO mice were immunized with chicken OVA protein in CFA, and on day 8 after immunization, splenocytes were isolated and restimulated with various concentrations of MHC class I-restricted SIINFEKL or MHC class II-restricted OVA323–339 peptide to assess antigen-specific CD8+ or CD4+ T cell responses, respectively. Upon restimulation with either peptide, MKP-1 KO cells produced reduced amounts of IL-2 and exhibited significantly reduced proliferation compared with WT cells (Fig. 3A). Effector cytokine production measurement revealed that KO cells also produced lower amounts of IFNγ compared with WT cells upon SIINFEKL peptide stimulation (Fig. 3B). In response to MHC class II-restricted OVA323–339 peptide restimulation, KO cells also produced much lower levels of Th1 (IFNγ), Th2 (IL-5), and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines compared with WT cells (Fig. 3B). To examine if MKP-1 plays any role in T cell-dependent humoral responses, we examined anti-OVA antibodies in the sera of WT and KO mice. As shown in Fig. 3C, both WT and KO mice had similar levels of anti-OVA IgM. However, the levels of anti-OVA IgG, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies in the sera of KO mice were all significantly lower than those in WT mice (Fig. 3C), indicating that a deficiency of MKP-1 reduces T cell-dependent humoral responses. Together, these data demonstrated that MKP-1 is required for antigen-specific T cell responses in vivo. Adaptive immunity mediated by T cells plays a principal protective role in response to intracellular pathogen infection such as viral infection. Reduced T cell responses in MKP-1 KO mice following immunization in vivo suggest that MKP-1 may be important in host defenses to pathogens. To assess this, we employed influenza viral infection, in which both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell functions are critical to resolution (26Eichelberger M. Allan W. Zijlstra M. Jaenisch R. Doherty P.C. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 27Bruder D. Srikiatkhachorn A. Enelow R.I. Viral Immunol. 2006; 19: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We infected both WT and MKP-1 KO mice with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8, H1N1) intranasally at a dose of 13 hemagglutinating units, which is nonlethal but causes severe disease in WT mice. At day 6 after influenza viral infection, WT mice started to lose weight, reaching the maximum weight loss by day 9 post-infection (∼8% of the original body weight) (Fig. 4A). In contrast, MKP-1 KO mice exhibited increased weight loss compared with WT mice in response to influenza viral infection, with a reduction as high as 13% of the original body weight by day 9 (Fig. 4A). To examine if MKP-1 KO mice have any defect in viral clearance, we examined the expression of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of influenza virus in the lungs of WT and KO mice at days 1, 2, and 7 using real-time reverse transcription-PCR. We found that the expression of both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes in the lungs of MKP-1 KO mice was not different from that in WT mice on days 1 and 2 (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that MKP-1 is dispensable for controlling viral growth at an early stage of infection. However, we found that on day 7, the expression of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes in the lungs of MKP-1 KO mice was significantly higher than that in the lungs of infected WT mice (Fig. 4B), indicating that MKP-1 KO mice are impaired in influenza viral clearance. Both virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are important in anti-influenza immunity and viral clearance (26Eichelberger M. Allan W. Zijlstra M. Jaenisch R. Doherty P.C. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 27Bruder D. Srikiatkhachorn A. Enelow R.I. Viral Immunol. 2006; 19: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the accumulation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in nasal mucosa peaks on day 7 following PR8 viral challenge (28Wiley J.A. Hogan R.J. Woodland D.L. Harmsen A.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3293-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To examine the regulation of anti-viral CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses by MKP-1, on days 7 and 9 after infection, leukocytes from BAL and lungs of infected mice were stained with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies. We found that BAL from MKP-1 KO mice contained significantly lower percentages of CD8+ T cells but increased CD4+ T cells compared with that from WT mice on both days 7 and 9 (supplemental Fig. S4A). It has been shown that pulmonary CD8+ T cell response to primary intranasal PR"

https://openalex.org/W2125988986,"The authors use voltage-sensitive dye imaging and multielectrode recordings to show that the average population response to rapid sequences of orientations can largely be predicted by summation of the responses to each of the individual elements in the sequence. However, they find that following stimulus removal the population response is more persistent than expected. Neuronal populations in sensory cortex represent time-changing sensory input through a spatiotemporal code. What are the rules that govern this code? We measured membrane potentials and spikes from neuronal populations in cat visual cortex (V1) using voltage-sensitive dyes and electrode arrays. We first characterized the population response to a single orientation. As response amplitude grew, the population tuning width remained constant for membrane potential responses and became progressively sharper for spike responses. We then asked how these single-orientation responses combine to code for successive orientations. We found that they combined through simple linear summation. Linearity, however, was violated after stimulus offset, when responses exhibited an unexplained persistence. As a result of linearity, the interactions between responses to successive stimuli were minimal. Our results indicate that higher cortical areas may reconstruct the stimulus sequence from V1 population responses through a simple instantaneous decoder. Therefore, spatial and temporal codes in area V1 operate largely independently."
https://openalex.org/W2007352439,"Chromatin insulators separate active transcriptional domains and block the spread of heterochromatin in the genome. Studies on the chicken hypersensitive site-4 (cHS4) element, a prototypic insulator, have identified CTCF and USF-1/2 motifs in the proximal 250 bp of cHS4, termed the “core”, which provide enhancer blocking activity and reduce position effects. However, the core alone does not insulate viral vectors effectively. The full-length cHS4 has excellent insulating properties, but its large size severely compromises vector titers. We performed a structure-function analysis of cHS4 flanking lentivirus-vectors and analyzed transgene expression in the clonal progeny of hematopoietic stem cells and epigenetic changes in cHS4 and the transgene promoter. We found that the core only reduced the clonal variegation in expression. Unique insulator activity resided in the distal 400 bp cHS4 sequences, which when combined with the core, restored full insulator activity and open chromatin marks over the transgene promoter and the insulator. These data consolidate the known insulating activity of the canonical 5′ core with a novel 3′ 400 bp element with properties similar to the core. Together, they have excellent insulating properties and viral titers. Our data have important implications in understanding the molecular basis of insulator function and design of gene therapy vectors."

(p. 1384 ) used electron microscopy and single-particle analysis to investigate the structure of an archaeal version that contains the small RNA (sRNA) and all the associated core proteins. Unexpectedly, this ribonucleoprotein is a homodimer, formed of two sRNAs and four copies of each of the core proteins. This dimer is likely to be the enzymatically active form, as mutations disrupting di-sRNP formation inhibited activity."

https://openalex.org/W2034652193,"Background If the amount of resources allocated to reproduction (K) is fixed, then an increase in seed mass (S) can only be achieved by a decrease in seed number (n = K/S). Thus, log(n) = log(K)−log(S) producing a slope of −1 when seed mass and number are plotted on log-log axes. However, in comparative studies, empirical support for a slope of −1 is limited and contentious, leading some to question the utility of this concept. Methodology/Principal Findings First, we show that the expected slope depends on whether genotypes and species producing seeds of different mass are expected to reach the same adult size and that this in turn depends partly on the nature of growth. Second, we present experimental results using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana. When these RILs are grown in large pots with plentiful nutrients, they exhibit a trade-off between seed size and number with a slope of −1.68 (±0.18) on log-log axes. This occurs because of genetic correlations between seed mass and adult size so that, under the right growth conditions, lines producing lighter seeds have the genetic potential to produce larger rosettes and hence a greater total mass of seeds. We re-grew lines in small pots (10 and 40 mm diameter) in a nutrient-poor substrate so that final adult size was heavily restricted by pot size. Conclusions/Significance Under our growth conditions, small-seeded lines were unable to produce a greater total mass of seeds. Hence a trade-off emerged between seed mass and seed number with a slope of −1.166±0.319 on log-log axes in 40-mm diameter pots (close to the expected value of −1), although the slope was 0.132±0.263 in 10-mm diameter pots, demonstrating that the nature of the trade-off is sensitive to the growth conditions."

IntroductionEukaryotic membrane fusion is a highly conserved process mediated by a defined set of proteins. The trafficking of cargo, in membrane bound vesicles, between intracellular compartments and to the plasma membrane is essential for cell function and survival.

Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). This family of proteins has been the subject of intense study over the last two decades, and it is now clear that they constitute the minimal machinery for membrane fusion (3Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar, 4Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In neurons and neuroendocrine cells, the regulated fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane is mediated by the vesicular SNARE synaptobrevin (also known as VAMP2) and the target SNAREs syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein, 25 kDa). These three proteins interact to form a four-helical complex; one helix from each of syntaxin and synaptobrevin and two helices from SNAP-25 (5Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The formation of this thermodynamically stable SNARE complex is thought to liberate the energy required to alter the local lipid environment and merge the two opposing lipid bilayers (6McNew J.A.

Biol. 2007; 14: 890-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).The process of membrane fusion is under strict temporal and spatial regulation. In neuronal transmission, exocytosis occurs at specific membrane sites and is tightly coupled to occur in response to depolarization of the nerve terminal. This regulation is, in part, mediated by accessory proteins that modulate the function of the SNARE proteins. One such family of SNARE regulators is the Sec1p/Munc18 (SM) protein family. These structurally conserved proteins, found throughout eukaryotic membrane trafficking, bind to their cognate syntaxin homologs to modulate SNARE function. However, the mechanisms underlying this regulation have been the subject of debate. Comparison of crystal structures of the mammalian SM protein, Munc18-1, and the yeast SM protein, Sly1p, both bound to their cognate syntaxins originally indicated two completely different modes of interaction (9Bracher A. Weissenhorn W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6114-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). This has since been reconciled by the observation that Munc18-1 can interact with syntaxin through two distinct binding mechanisms: an interaction with syntaxin in a so called “closed” conformation and binding to the N terminus of syntaxin (11Dulubova I. Khvotchev M. Liu S. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 12Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J.

Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, it was proposed to call the closed binding conformation mode 1 and the N-terminal interaction mode 2 or mode 3 (depending on whether syntaxin was alone or in the SNARE complex, respectively) (14Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: R255-R258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As these latter two modes relate to the same binding site on syntaxin, for clarity, we will term them mode 2/3 as the principal aim of this nomenclature is the distinction between the different sites of the syntaxin/Munc18 interaction. These binding modes were shown to be distinct in vivo, both spatially and functionally, occurring in different cellular membrane compartments, with the mode 2/3 interaction directly influencing membrane fusion (12Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the N-terminal peptide of syntaxin 4 bound to its cognate SM protein munc18c (Munc18-3) provided further weight to mode 2/3 binding being an important feature of mammalian SM proteins (15Hu S.H. Latham C.F. Gee C.L. James D.E. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8773-8778Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This led to the reanalysis of the crystal structure diffraction data of Munc18-1 bound to syntaxin and the observation of a mode 2/3 interaction in concert with mode 1 binding (the electron density present but unattributed in the original data) (16Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In combination with findings from other SM protein/syntaxin interactions (17Carpp L.N. Ciufo L.F. Shanks S.G. Boyd A. Bryant N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Latham C.F. Lopez J.A. Hu S.H. Gee C.L. Westbury E. Blair D.H. Armishaw C.J.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17730-17735Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it is now becoming clear that a dual mode of interaction may be ubiquitous for these two evolutionarily conserved protein families.In addition to defining how syntaxin and Munc18 interact, a great deal of interest has focused on the regulation of their interaction. From the initial biochemical observations of an inhibitory effect of the mode 1 interaction on the transition of syntaxin, bound by Munc18, into the ternary SNARE complex, several regulators have been proposed. Munc18 was found to be a substrate for protein kinase C which, through phosphorylation of Ser306 and Ser307, could prevent the mode 1 association of syntaxin and Munc18 (20Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. Kotani H. Kimura T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7265-7268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, Munc18 could not be phosphorylated by protein kinase C in the assembled syntaxin-Munc18 complex and therefore may only serve a role in regulating the pool of unbound Munc18 (21Barclay J.W. Craig T.J. Fisher R.J. Ciufo L.F. Evans G.J. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10538-10545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, have been shown to act directly on the mode 1 interaction of syntaxin 1 with Munc18 in vitro, permitting the transition of syntaxin 1 from this inhibited state into the ternary SNARE complex (22Rickman C. Davletov B. Chem Biol. 2005; 12: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Connell E. Darios F. Broersen K. Gatsby N. Peak-Chew S.Y. Rickman C. Davletov B. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, other proteinaceous factors have been proposed to influence mode 1 binding, although their mechanisms remain enigmatic. It is likely that one or more factors act in concert to regulate the mode 1 interaction between syntaxin 1 and Munc18-1.The characterization of the mode 2/3 interaction of syntaxin 1 with Munc18-1 provides a new target for possible regulation (11Dulubova I. Khvotchev M. Liu S. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 12Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J.

Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, to date, no regulators of the mode 2/3 interaction have been identified. Early work into the function of synaptotagmin, the proposed neuronal calcium sensor, observed that syntaxin 1 is phosphorylated in vivo by casein kinase II (CKII) (24Bennett M.K. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using in vitro phosphorylation of truncation mutants and the use of phospho-specific antibodies in vivo, it was shown that Ser14 is a target for CKII (25Foletti D.L. Lin R. Finley M.A. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4535-4544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Risinger C. Bennett M.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). While the phosphorylation of this site was observed to increase through development in parallel with synapse development and maturation, the authors were unable to provide a mechanism regulated by this modification. The constructs used lacked N-terminal amino acids, thus only mode 1 binding would have been detected. Importantly, this site is well placed to directly influence the mode 2/3 interaction of syntaxin 1 with Munc18-1.We investigated the role of phosphorylation of Ser14 in syntaxin 1 on its interaction with Munc18. Through a series of phosphomimetic and phospho-null mutations, we show that Ser14 is a key regulator of interaction between syntaxin and Munc18 at the plasma membrane, previously shown to be the cellular location where mode 2/3 interaction is predominant (12Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Using advanced microscopy, we were able to probe, at high frequency, changes in dynamic protein interactions at the plasma membrane to investigate the influence of Ser14 on the syntaxin/Munc18-1 interaction. Downstream of modulating this protein/protein interaction, modification of Ser14 had a direct influence on the mobility of secretory vesicles and their concomitant fusion competence.RESULTSPrevious work found that syntaxin 1 is phosphorylated by CKII on Ser14 (24Bennett M.K. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Foletti D.L. Lin R. Finley M.A. Scheller R.H. J.

However, we were unable to identify any biological function for this modification. In the four syntaxin 1 orthologs from model organisms, the CKII phosphorylation consensus site is highly conserved (Fig. 1a). In contrast, this phosphorylation site is less conserved in mammalian syntaxin paralogs. Syntaxins 1a and 4 exhibit a high degree of similarity with only conservative changes in the acidic region of the CKII consensus site. In contrast, syntaxins 2 and 3 have only a partially conserved acidic region (essential for CKII phosphorylation) and syntaxin 3 does not possess a suitable serine residue although a threonine residue (Thr19) could support some phosphorylation (32Marin O. Meggio F. Marchiori F. Borin G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This loss of the CKII consensus site is correlated by previous in vitro phosphorylation experiments, which showed that syntaxins 1a and 4 were more readily phosphorylated than syntaxins 2 and 3 (26Risinger C. Bennett M.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) suggesting a patterning of regulation to provide differential modulation of downstream function. A structural alignment of Munc18-1 and Munc18-3 demonstrates the highly conserved structural features surrounding the syntaxin N-terminal binding site (Fig. 1b).This phosphorylation site is well placed to potentially influence the interaction of the N terminus of syntaxin 1 with Munc18-1. We thus investigated the role of Ser14 in syntaxin 1, analyzing directly its effect on the interaction with Munc18-1 and the functional consequences of this on vesicle dynamics and fusion in living neuroendocrine cells. We verified that Ser14 is a target for CKII phosphorylation and that this action could be influenced, through targeted mutagenesis, using a series of mutations generated in the CKII consensus site (Fig. 1c). The Asp17 substitution used in these experiments allowed preservation of the serine but disrupted the CKII acidic consensus sequence at the most critical position (32Marin O. Meggio F. Marchiori F. Borin G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Purified, bacterially expressed proteins harboring Ser14 or Asp17 substitutions were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation using pure CKII, with detection of phosphate incorporation using a fluorescent in-gel stain. This confirmed that syntaxin 1 Ser14 is the sole CKII phosphorylation site in this protein and that substitution at Asp17 completely abolishes this activity. We next confirmed that these phospho-mimetic and phospho-null mutations can perturb the phosphorylation pattern of syntaxin in vivo. Heterologous, wild-type syntaxin was efficiently phosphorylated on serine 14; this was abrogated when either Ser14 was modified, or the CKII consensus site was disrupted (Fig. 1d).To investigate the impact of these phosphomimetic and phospho-null mutations on mode 2/3 interactions, we used mCerulean (mCer)-labeled syntaxin and EYFP-fused Munc18-1, combined with TCSPC. These functional proteins constitute an excellent FRET pair (33Liu J. Ernst S.A. Gladycheva S.E. Lee Y.Y. Lentz S.I. Ho C.S. Li Q. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55924-55936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which we have previously used in living cells to examine the spatial organization of the different modes of syntaxin/Munc18 interaction (12Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). mCer-syntaxin and EYFP-Munc18-1 were expressed in neuroendocrine cells, and image data from live cells were acquired using 2-photon excitation (Fig. 2). These data showed a principally plasma membrane localization for syntaxin/Munc18-1 with some intracellular compartments also labeled, as observed previously (34Medine C.N. Rickman C. Chamberlain L.H. Duncan R.R. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4407-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). FLIM showed a statistically significant quenching of the mean fluorescence lifetime from 2,288 ± 40 ps (mean ± S.E., n = 18; Ref. 12Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol.

This compares well with our previous studies (12Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and indicates interaction of syntaxin and Munc18 on the plasma membrane. The difference in donor fluorescence lifetime at the plasma membrane and on intracellular compartments is a result of the different modes of interaction which predominate at each location (12Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Phosphorylation of syntaxin regulates its interaction with Munc18-1, specifically at the plasma membrane. TCSPC-FLIM reports FRET between mCerulean Syx1–288 (the donor) and EYFP-Munc18-1 (the acceptor) in live cells. Intensity images (upper row; gray scale) show wild-type and mutant mCerulean Syx1–288 localized to the plasma membrane of cells coexpressing EYFP-Munc18-1 (not shown in these images). TCSPC-FLIM data (bottom row) illustrate the excited state fluorescence lifetime of the donor. The mCerulean Syx1–288 exhibited a single fluorescence decay with a time constant of 2,288 ± 40 ps (mean ± S.E., n = 18) in the absence of an acceptor (EYFP and unfused Munc18-1). When coexpressed with EYFP-Munc18-1, this lifetime became significantly quenched (1,872 ± 333 ps, weighted mean of two components ± S.E., n = 5), indicative of FRET and protein interaction. The phosphomimetic form of syntaxin (Syx1–288(S14E)) returned the mean fluorescence lifetime to values not significantly different from that observed in the absence of an acceptor (2,035 ± 252 ps, weighted mean of two components ± S.E., n = 5). Notably, this change was restricted to the plasma membrane. The phospho-null syntaxin (Syx1–288(S14A)) resulted in a fluorescence lifetime not dissimilar to that observed for Syx1–288(S14E). The phospho-null syntaxin (Syx1–288(D17A)) had no detectable effect on the interaction. Scale bar, 5 μm.

Although syntaxin localization was unaltered compared with wild-type, importantly, decreased interaction was detected between the phosphomimetic syntaxin and Munc18-1 on the plasma membrane. In comparison, there was no detectable change to the interaction in the intracellular compartments where mode 1 binding predominates (12Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol.

The D17A phospho-null mutant also exhibited efficient trafficking to the plasma membrane, with representative mean fluorescence lifetimes in agreement with wild-type mCer-syntaxin at the plasma membrane (1,968 ± 172 ps for D17A compared with 1,831 ± 178 ps in the wild-type) and at intracellular membranes (1,627 ± 94 ps for D17A compared with 1,667 ± 189 ps for wild-type). When syntaxin harboring S14A was used in this assay, the reported mean fluorescence lifetimes (plasma membrane, 1,919 ± 297 ps; intracellular membranes, 1,536 ± 86 ps) were comparable to that observed for the S14E mutation (plasma membrane 2,284 ± 214 ps; intracellular membranes 1,640 ± 139 ps). Taken together with our previous findings (12Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), these data indicate that Ser14 is a key residue in mode 2/3 interactions at the plasma membrane. As S14E and S14A mutations in syntaxin resulted in similar responses, as reported by fluorescence lifetime measurements, we hypothesize that specific interactions between syntaxin and Munc18 (for example part of a hydrogen bonding network), involving this amino acid, are essential for binding. Unfortunately, the position of Ser14 and its interactions are not resolved in the currently available crystal structure of syntaxin 1 and Munc18-1 (16Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, phosphorylation of this site by CKII (24Bennett M.K. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. J.

J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) would disrupt the specific interactions of Ser14 in a similar manner to that observed for the phosphomimetic mutation. As a result of these findings, we utilized D17A as a phospho-null mutation in subsequent experiments to preserve the functionality of Ser14.FLIM data are collated over a long acquisition time (typically tens of seconds) and therefore report the average interaction at each cellular location during this period. This is necessary to acquire sufficient photons for a robust mathematical appraisal of the data but is too slow to probe the dynamics of small ensembles of proteins, which we considered essential to gain further understanding of SM protein biology in living cells. Our approach to overcome this limitation was two-fold. First, we utilized dark EYFP as a FRET acceptor, which has greatly reduced emission (28Ganesan S. Ameer-Beg S.M. Ng T.T. Vojnovic B. Wouters F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4089-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 35Lee S.J. Escobedo-Lozoya Y. Szatmari E.M. Yasuda R. Nature. 2009; 458: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), thus permitting a broader donor filter regime. Second, we streamed data from diffraction-limited regions selectable from anywhere in the three-dimensional volume of the cell. In this way, a single excitation volume is treated as a tiny cuvette (0.1 sub-femtoliter), in a live cell, within which the dynamics of a small number of molecules (fewer than 10; Ref. 34Medine C.N. Rickman C. Chamberlain L.H. Duncan R.R. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4407-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) can be probed in real time. The recording volume was targeted to the plasma membrane of the cell, to where the effect of syntaxin N-terminal interaction with Munc18-1 was restricted, and the photons emitted from the donor mCer-syntaxin were recorded over time (Fig. 3, a and b). The generation of a probability distribution of the number of photons arriving in a time interval (known as a photon counting histogram; Fig. 3c) (36Qian H. Elson E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) demonstrated characteristic, non-random signal fluctuations that were not attributable to noise alone. This was performed for mCer-syntaxin in the presence of unfused dkEYFP (noninteracting control) with a complete fluorescence decay curve acquired every 100 ms (Fig. 3d). The measured fluorescence lifetime from each sampling interval and from multiple experiments were combined and fit by a Gaussian distribution (Fig. 3e). Next, we determined the 99.9% confidence interval of this distribution. Using this as a threshold, we were able to identify, in subsequent experiments, those sampling time intervals where interactions occurred. There was no correlation between donor fluorescence lifetime and intensity (Fig. 3f, left panel), demonstrating that protein concentration and fluorescence lifetime are independent. We generated separate two-dimensional kymographs of the number of photons and fluorescence lifetimes, where each vertical stripe corresponds to a single sampling window (Fig. 3f, right panel). The complex information contained in the fluorescence lifetime kymograph is simplified by applying the segmentation (derived in Fig. 3e) to show in a binary format kinetic changes in protein interaction. Importantly, using this spectroscopic approach, it is possible to observe protein interaction dynamics in living cells.FIGURE 3Dynamic syntaxin/Munc18 interactions at the plasma membrane (16Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Targeting the laser excitation beam on the plasma membrane (a) allows the fast streaming of TCSPC data from a single point. b, photon fluctuations are shown, with an expanded time scale in the lower graph. c, the photon fluctuations contain a non-random signal as evidenced by the non-Poisson distribution. d, the TCSPC data can be fit by an exponential decay for each time sample, and the time constant of the fluorescence decays can be calculated: in this case, decay curves were acquired every 100 ms. e, to allow segmentation of the lifetimes into intervals where interacting (red) or non-interacting (green) conditions predominate, TCSPC-FLIM data from a cell expressing mCer-syntaxin and unfused dkEYFP (as a control for the non-FRET condition) was plotted on a histogram. The distribution of lifetimes was fit by a single Gaussian and the lower 99.9% confidence interval of the distribution used to segment the data (threshold at 1,950 ps). f, the measured fluorescence lifetime exhibited no correlation with the fluorescence intensity (photon count, left panel), highlighting the independence of these two properties of the fluorophores.

This revealed that at the plasma membrane, interaction stability is enhanced in the phospho-null substitution (D17A) and reduced in the phospho-mimetic form of syntaxin (S14E); Fig. 4a). The absence of detectable fluctuations in the interaction state of syntaxin (D17A) precluded further analysis. Most likely, this is a result of the fluctuations in interactions falling below the sensitivity of our system. Importantly, however, statistical quantification of the interaction status and dwell time of the proteins, akin to channel conductance analyses, revealed that both the mean interact"

Initially, an embryonic mouse substantia nigra-derived cell line (SN4741 cells) was infected with short hairpin RNA lentiviruses encoding the murine transcript of the SKP1A gene or with scrambled vector. SKP1A silencing resulted in increased susceptibility to neuronal damages induced by the parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion and serum starvation, in parallel with a decline in the expression of the dopaminergic markers, dopamine transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter-2. SKP1A-deficient cells presented a delay in completion of the cell cycle and the inability to arrest at the G0/G1 phase when induced to differentiate. Instead, the cells progressed through S phase, developing rounded aggregates with characteristics of aggresomes including immunoreactivity for γ-tubulin, α-synuclein, ubiquitin, tyrosine hydroxylase, Hsc-70 (70-kDa heat shock cognate protein), and proteasome subunit, and culminating in a lethal phenotype. Conversely, stably enforced expression of wild type SKP1A duplicated the survival index of naïve SN4741 cells under proteasomal inhibition injury, suggesting a new structural role of SKP1 in dopaminergic neuronal function, besides its E3 ligase activity. These results link, for the first time, SKP1 to dopamine neuronal function and survival, suggesting an essential role in sporadic PD.

One of them, SKP1A (p19, S phase kinase-associated protein 1A), an essential component of protein catabolism, has been found to be significantly decreased in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of post-mortem parkinsonian brains compared with age-matched controls at the gene and protein level (1.Grünblatt E. Mandel S. Jacob-Hirsch J. Zeligson S. Amariglo N. Rechavi G. Li J. Ravid R. Roggendorf W. Riederer P. Youdim M.B. J. Neural.

Disord. 2007; 13: S242-S247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Skp1 protein is a component of the largest class of E3 ubiquitin ligases, functioning within modular multiprotein SCF (Skp1, Cullin 1, a substrate-recognizing F-box protein and Rbx1) (7.Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8.Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P.

SCF complexes are modular: Skp1 can interact with several F-box proteins that are responsible for specific target recognition, thereby increasing the repertoire of different proteins targeted by this complex. The finding that Skp1 is decreased inside the melanized post-mitotic neurons of the SNpc from PD brains (6.Mandel S.A. Fishman T. Youdim M.B. Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. 2007; 13: S242-S247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that humans express only one functional Skp1 isoform (9.Semple C.A. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) may partly account for a wide impairment in the function of an entire repertoire of proteins implicated in dopaminergic neurotransmission. Ubiquitination and proteasomal-mediated protein handling defects are thought to be common features in PD and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease and in aging (10.Ciechanover A. Brundin P. Neuron. 2003; 40: 427-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 11.Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). This is suggested to affect several cellular processes associated with ubiquitination such as cell cycle, intracellular trafficking, signaling pathways, degradation, and aggregation of normal and damaged intracellular proteins. A significant body of evidence points to a crucial role for protein misfolding and aggregation in the formation of protein inclusion bodies or Lewy bodies (LBs) in sporadic PD. A loss of 20 S proteasome α-subunits and reduction in the activity of the 26/20 S proteasome system in SNpc of sporadic PD has also been reported (12.McNaught K.S. Belizaire R. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Isacson O. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 326: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13.McNaught K.S. Jenner P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar).A role for the ubiquitin proteasome system in PD pathogenesis has received support from the finding that mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin, cause early onset, autosomal recessive PD, characterized by midbrain DA neuron loss (14.Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar). Functional loss as a consequence of mutations present at different regions of the parkin protein is suggested to exert a profound effect on its function, resulting from its aggregation into inclusion bodies and disturbance in cell localization (15.Cookson M.R. Lockhart P.J. McLendon C. O'Farrell C. Schlossmacher M. Farrer M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2957-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16.Wang C. Tan J.M. Ho M.W. Zaiden N. Wong S.H. Chew C.L. Eng P.W. Lim T.M. Dawson T.M. Lim K.L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, disease-linked point mutations in parkin, which retain their catalytic E3 ligase activity, have a propensity to mislocalize within the cell and aggregate in inclusion bodies (17.Chung K.K. Zhang Y. Lim K.L. Tanaka Y. Huang H. Gao J. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). This implies that disruption of the cytoplasmic co-localization with essential protein partners may constitute the molecular basis of the loss of parkin function. Neuronal and non-neuronal cells overexpressing parkin form large, noncytotoxic cytoplasmic inclusions under proteasomal inhibition (18.Ardley H.C. Scott G.B. Rose S.A. Tan N.G. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4541-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Besides SKP1A, our pioneer large scale transcriptomics analysis of gene expression profile of sporadic PD SNpc (1.Grünblatt E. Mandel S. Jacob-Hirsch J. Zeligson S. Amariglo N. Rechavi G. Li J. Ravid R. Roggendorf W. Riederer P. Youdim M.B. J. Neural. Transm. 2004; 111: 1543-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) has identified a number of differentially expressed genes participating in the neurotoxic cascade of DA neurons death, in particular those related to the handling of proteins, dopaminergic transmission, and metabolism. One such gene is HSPA8 (heat shock 70-kDa protein 8), coding for Hsc-70 (70 kDa heat-shock cognate protein), a member of the Hsp70 family whose expression was severely reduced in PD SN. Hsc-70 acts as a chaperone responsible for recognition of unfolded or aberrant proteins and delivery to a co-chaperone, E3 ligase enzyme CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein), which in turn, can cooperate with Hsp90 and/or Hsp70/Hsc-70 and ubiquitinate their attached misfolded substrates (19.Murata S. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recent confirmatory immunohistochemical studies in the PD SNpc (6.Mandel S.A. Fishman T. Youdim M.B. Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. 2007; 13: S242-S247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) revealed a discrete Hsc-70-positive stain delineating the halo of the LB. This localization is not surprising because molecular chaperones as well as ubiquitin and proteasome subunits are recruited to the LB and other inclusion bodies (20.Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 21.Stenoien D.L. Cummings C.J. Adams H.P. Mancini M.G. Patel K. DeMartino G.N. Marcelli M. Weigel N.L. Mancini M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Additional reductions were observed in the DA transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2), both key components in the regulation of DA disposition in the synapse and cytosol. Also, the genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenase, family 5, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A1 (ALDH1A1)), both involved in the degradation of aldehyde derivatives of DA, generated by the action of MAO-A and -B, were down-regulated. These highly reactive, neurotoxic aldehydes can accumulate in case of decreased levels of ALDH and ADH, as occurs in SNpc of PD, and can promote neuronal death (22.Hjelle J.J. Petersen D.R. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1983; 18: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23.Mårdh G. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7279-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Previous studies aimed at developing transgenic models of PD by knock-out or overexpressing single familial PD mutated genes have not met with the expected success because the cell types that are affected typically do not mirror those that are vulnerable in human sporadic PD (24.Farrer M.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 25.Perez F.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sci. 2007; 3: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the various forms of familial PD, as caused by gene mutation, will not contribute to the identification of the final cascade of molecular events that result in degeneration of DA neurons in sporadic PD. In the present study we sought to investigate the impact of RNA interference-mediated silencing of SKP1A, found significantly reduced in sporadic PD SNpc (1.Grünblatt E. Mandel S. Jacob-Hirsch J. Zeligson S. Amariglo N. Rechavi G. Li J. Ravid R. Roggendorf W. Riederer P. Youdim M.B. J. Neural. Transm. 2004; 111: 1543-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), on the survival of differentiated mesencephalic embryonically derived SN4741 dopaminergic cell line and expression of dopaminergic phenotype markers. The ultimate goal is to develop a genetic model of sporadic PD that recapitulates, at the cellular level, the central molecular pathology occurring in DA neuron degeneration in PD.DISCUSSIONThe results of the present study show that Skp1 deficiency leads to a lethal phenotype in arrested/post-mitotic SN-derived cells, suggesting that Skp1 may play a crucial role at the interface between the cell cycle, differentiation, and death. This observation links, for the first time, Skp1 to DA neuronal function and survival, suggesting an essential role in sporadic PD. Support for a central role of Skp1 in dopaminergic neuron phenotype is provided by the prominent elevation in both SKP1 gene and protein levels upon cell cycle arrest-induced differentiation, in parallel to the DA neuron markers DAT, TH, VMAT2, and ALDH1A1. As far as we know, this is the first report of Skp1 as a potential player in neuronal maturation.There are at least two possible explanations for the lethal phenotype demonstrated in SKP1A silenced, arrested cells. The reduced expression of Skp1 protein may cause the malfunction of the E3 ligase SCF complex and subsequent dysregulation of cell cycle regulators of the G1/S transition, such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and cell cycle inhibitors (7.Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 43.Spruck C.H. Strohmaier H.M. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is well known that in neurodegenerative diseases there is a loss of cell cycle control, leading eventually to neuronal death (44.Copani A. Uberti D. Sortino M.A. Bruno V. Nicoletti F. Memo M. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Indeed, events that force mature neurons back into the cell cycle are lethal rather than mitogenic for the neuron. In line with this, knockdown of two components of the ubiquitin proteasome system, the ubiquitin ligase scaffolding protein Cul-1 and the proteasome-associated deubiquitinating protein Pad-1, lead to cell cycle reactivation and apoptosis in subsets of postmitotic neurons (45.Staropoli J.F. Abeliovich A. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 27: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, Skp1 might have a structural or functional role in the cell, essential to cell survival and differentiation processes in higher organisms. A first functional link between Skp1 and tissue cell degeneration in mammals has been provided only lately in mice null for Fbx2, a brain enriched F-box protein that appears to function with Skp1 in an apparently novel heterodimeric complex, rather than in the traditional SCF tetramer in inner ear cochlear tissue. Here, the deficiency of Fbx2 led to a parallel loss of Skp1 specifically in the cochleae and cellular degeneration, resulting in age-related hearing loss (46.Nelson R.F. Glenn K.A. Zhang Y. Wen H. Knutson T. Gouvion C.M. Robinson B.K. Zhou Z. Yang B. Smith R.J. Paulson H.L. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5163-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). There was no indication, however, regarding the expression levels of Skp1 in the SN of these Fbx2 null mice and whether the integrity/function of the DA neurons was compromised. Consistent with these finding is that in yeasts Skp1 was found to associate with the F-box protein RCY1 without assembling into an SCF complex and to participate in the recycling of internalized proteins (47.Galan J.M. Wiederkehr A. Seol J.H. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Deshaies R.J. Riezman H. Peter M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3105-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Parkin has been found to function in a SCF-like multiprotein complex that includes the F-box/WD repeat protein hSel-10 and Cullin-1, and cyclin E was identified as a target of this complex (48.Staropoli J.F. McDermott C. Martinat C. Schulman B. Demireva E. Abeliovich A. Neuron. 2003; 37: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This composite activity of parkin may potentially increase the repertoire of proteins targeted for ubiquitination.The finding that SKP1A is decreased in SNpc from PD patients suggests a broad impairment in the function of an entire selection of proteins, leading to their inappropriate expression or activation and eventually cell death. Indeed, our and other's laboratories microarray transcriptomic studies of sporadic PD SNpc (1.Grünblatt E. Mandel S. Jacob-Hirsch J. Zeligson S. Amariglo N. Rechavi G. Li J. Ravid R. Roggendorf W.

Under normal physiological conditions, DAT and VMAT are key components in the regulation of DA disposition in the synapse and cytosol. Following vesicular DA release into the synapse, the DAT transports DA from the presynaptic area into the cytosol of the presynaptic nerve terminal of DA neurons (49.Riddle E.L. Fleckenstein A.E. Hanson G.R. AAPS J. 2005; 7: E847-E851Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Given that ALDH1, VMAT, and DAT are located within DA-containing neurons of SNpc, the reduction in their gene expression may contribute to a failure in DA transmission and metabolism. In agreement with the human findings, the shRNA-mediated decrease of Skp1 induced a parallel down-regulation of DAT, VMAT2, and ALDH1A1 mRNA. In addition, Skp1-deficient cells displayed decreased expression levels of HSPA8, coding for the HSP70 family chaperone Hsc-70, which is responsible for recognizing unfolded or aberrant proteins. Its gene and protein levels were found significantly reduced in sporadic PD (1.Grünblatt E. Mandel S. Jacob-Hirsch J. Zeligson S. Amariglo N. Rechavi G. Li J. Ravid R. Roggendorf W. Riederer P.

Disord. 2007; 13: S242-S247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This may exacerbate the accumulation of a wide spectrum of ubiquitinated protein aggregates in PD brains such as TH, synphilin-1, α-synuclein, and phosphorylated tau (19.Murata S. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 50.Imai Y. Soda M. Hatakeyama S. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nakayama K.I. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found proteinaceous round inclusion structures that stained positively for α-synuclein, TH, ubiquitin, 19 S proteasomal protein PSMC4, and Hsc-70, all components of LBs. Some inclusions presented as single perinuclear γ-tubulin-positive aggregates, reminiscent of centriole-associated structures termed aggresomes (51.Olzmann J.A. Li L. Chin L.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 2008; 15: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that a similar process may occur in the dopaminergic neurons of PD patients, where these structures may represent a precursor of LBs. As far as we know this is the first report showing that a deficiency in an E3 ubiquitin ligase, identified as significantly reduced in human SNpc from sporadic PD, promotes the formation of aggresome-like inclusions and ultimate cell death, occurring only in differentiated neurons. Thus, the present finding can suggest a novel paradigm in which dysfunction of Skp1 promotes LB-like inclusion body formation rather than the presence of these inclusions as the culprit of DA neuron death. Interestingly, in parkin-related PD there is a general absence of LB inclusions in post-mortem brain samples of patients, and sporadic PD brains do not present alterations in the mRNA or protein levels of parkin.In support for a protective role of Skp1 in brain function, we found a significant decrease of Skp1 in MPTP-parkinsonian mice, specifically in the midbrain in correlation with a loss of TH protein. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the midbrain and striatum contain the lowest Skp1 protein levels, compared with frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, probably contributing to the particular susceptibility of the SNpc dopaminergic neurons to different types of stresses such as increased iron concentration, enzymatic (monoamine oxidase) and nonenzymatic (auto-oxidation) DA metabolism, abnormal protein accumulation, proteasomal inhibition, and neurotoxin-induced OS. In agreement with our findings in humans and MPTP-induced parkinsonism, cultured naïve SN4741 DA neurons exposed to the DA neuron-selective neurotoxin MPP+, a dynamic producer of ROS, caused an early and progressive down-regulation of Skp1, concomitantly with ALDH1 and Hsc-70 proteins. This finding further supports the view of these proteins as intimately connected to the neuronal death process in sporadic PD and probably, acting as early players in the neurotoxic cascade. It has been proposed that subtle alterations in a small number of interconnecting crucial genes, occurring during the presymptomatic manifestation of PD, account for the slowly progressive neurodegeneration of the DA-containing neurons (52.Mandel S. Amit T. Kalfon L. Youdim M.B. Expert Opin. Drug Discov. 2007; 2: 1225-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is possible that the gradual functional decrease in Skp1 and its dopaminergic counterparts shown in this study represents a “convergence point” shared by both the familial and sporadic cases. Further comparative studies in familial versus sporadic PD brains would shed light on the similarities between both forms of the disease and the role of Skp1. Future studies aimed at silencing the corresponding genes might reveal novel molecular counterparts and their interplay in PD.Although Skp1-deficient neurons begin to die in the process of differentiation, morphological and biochemical changes were already apparent in proliferating cells. The cells acquired an elongated and thinner cell body and divide more slowly because of a delay in completion of the cell cycle. In addition, significant reductions in the expression of some DA markers were also evident. These changes are presumably involved in the increased sensitization of Skp1 knockdown cells to damage induced by MPP+ and serum withdrawal, further supporting a defensive role of Skp1 in dopaminergic neurons. By contrast, overexpression of Skp1 protein conferred protection to naïve SN4741 dopaminergic cells against damage induced by exposure to MPP+ and pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome. The observation that Skp1 is still able to rescue SN4741 cells under proteasomal inhibition implies a distinct function of Skp1, unrelated to its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This assumption merits further investigation. Indeed, we are currently performing immunoprecipitation studies to elucidate the putative interacting partners of Skp1 in neuronal cultures and mice midbrain tissue.In summary, the data presented here suggest that Skp1 plays a fundamental role in DA neuron viability in the context of cell cycle arrest and differentiation. Indeed, its deficiency has reproduced to a significant extent the molecular alterations described in sporadic PD at the cellular level. This and the protection afforded by Skp1 overexpression support its genetic manipulation as a new model of sporadic PD. The understanding of the functional/structural role of Skp1 and its mechanism of action may lead to novel therapeutic approaches targeted at its molecular pathway counterparts.

One of them, SKP1A (p19, S phase kinase-associated protein 1A), an essential component of protein catabolism, has been found to be significantly decreased in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of post-mortem parkinsonian brains compared with age-matched controls at the gene and protein level (1.Grünblatt E. Mandel S. Jacob-Hirsch J. Zeligson S. Amariglo N. Rechavi G. Li J. Ravid R. Roggendorf W. Riederer P. Youdim M.B. J. Neural.

Disord. 2007; 13: S242-S247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Skp1 protein is a component of the largest class of E3 ubiquitin ligases, functioning within modular multiprotein SCF (Skp1, Cullin 1, a substrate-recognizing F-box protein and Rbx1) (7.Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8.Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P.

SCF complexes are modular: Skp1 can interact with several F-box proteins that are responsible for specific target recognition, thereby increasing the repertoire of different proteins targeted by this complex. The finding that Skp1 is decreased inside the melanized post-mitotic neurons of the SNpc from PD brains (6.Mandel S.A. Fishman T. Youdim M.B. Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. 2007; 13: S242-S247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that humans express only one functional Skp1 isoform (9.Semple C.A. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) may partly account for a wide impairment in the function of an entire repertoire of proteins implicated in dopaminergic neurotransmission. Ubiquitination and proteasomal-mediated protein handling defects are thought to be common features in PD and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease and in aging (10.Ciechanover A. Brundin P. Neuron. 2003; 40: 427-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 11.Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). This is suggested to affect several cellular processes associated with ubiquitination such as cell cycle, intracellular trafficking, signaling pathways, degradation, and aggregation of normal and damaged intracellular proteins. A significant body of evidence points to a crucial role for protein misfolding and aggregation in the formation of protein inclusion bodies or Lewy bodies (LBs) in sporadic PD. A loss of 20 S proteasome α-subunits and reduction in the activity of the 26/20 S proteasome system in SNpc of sporadic PD has also been reported (12.McNaught K.S. Belizaire R. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Isacson O. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 326: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13.McNaught K.S. Jenner P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar).A role for the ubiquitin proteasome system in PD pathogenesis has received support from the finding that mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin, cause early onset, autosomal recessive PD, characterized by midbrain DA neuron loss (14.Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar). Functional loss as a consequence of mutations present at different regions of the parkin protein is suggested to exert a profound effect on its function, resulting from its aggregation into inclusion bodies and disturbance in cell localization (15.Cookson M.R. Lockhart P.J. McLendon C. O'Farrell C. Schlossmacher M. Farrer M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2957-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16.Wang C. Tan J.M. Ho M.W. Zaiden N. Wong S.H. Chew C.L. Eng P.W. Lim T.M. Dawson T.M. Lim K.L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, disease-linked point mutations in parkin, which retain their catalytic E3 ligase activity, have a propensity to mislocalize within the cell and aggregate in inclusion bodies (17.Chung K.K. Zhang Y. Lim K.L. Tanaka Y. Huang H. Gao J. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). This implies that disruption of the cytoplasmic co-localization with essential protein partners may constitute the molecular basis of the loss of parkin function. Neuronal and non-neuronal cells overexpressing parkin form large, noncytotoxic cytoplasmic inclusions under proteasomal inhibition (18.Ardley H.C. Scott G.B. Rose S.A. Tan N.G. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4541-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Besides SKP1A, our pioneer large scale transcriptomics analysis of gene expression profile of sporadic PD SNpc (1.Grünblatt E. Mandel S. Jacob-Hirsch J. Zeligson S. Amariglo N. Rechavi G. Li J. Ravid R. Roggendorf W. Riederer P. Youdim M.B. J. Neural. Transm. 2004; 111: 1543-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) has identified a number of differentially expressed genes participating in the neurotoxic cascade of DA neurons death, in particular those related to the handling of proteins, dopaminergic transmission, and metabolism. One such gene is HSPA8 (heat shock 70-kDa protein 8), coding for Hsc-70 (70 kDa heat-shock cognate protein), a member of the Hsp70 family whose expression was severely reduced in PD SN. Hsc-70 acts as a chaperone responsible for recognition of unfolded or aberrant proteins and delivery to a co-chaperone, E3 ligase enzyme CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein), which in turn, can cooperate with Hsp90 and/or Hsp70/Hsc-70 and ubiquitinate their attached misfolded substrates (19.Murata S. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recent confirmatory immunohistochemical studies in the PD SNpc (6.Mandel S.A. Fishman T. Youdim M.B. Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. 2007; 13: S242-S247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) revealed a discrete Hsc-70-positive stain delineating the halo of the LB. This localization is not surprising because molecular chaperones as well as ubiquitin and proteasome subunits are recruited to the LB and other inclusion bodies (20.Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 21.Stenoien D.L. Cummings C.J. Adams H.P. Mancini M.G. Patel K. DeMartino G.N. Marcelli M. Weigel N.L. Mancini M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Additional reductions were observed in the DA transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2), both key components in the regulation of DA disposition in the synapse and cytosol. Also, the genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenase, family 5, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A1 (ALDH1A1)), both involved in the degradation of aldehyde derivatives of DA, generated by the action of MAO-A and -B, were down-regulated. These highly reactive, neurotoxic aldehydes can accumulate in case of decreased levels of ALDH and ADH, as occurs in SNpc of PD, and can promote neuronal death (22.Hjelle J.J. Petersen D.R. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1983; 18: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23.Mårdh G. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7279-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Previous studies aimed at developing transgenic models of PD by knock-out or overexpressing single familial PD mutated genes have not met with the expected success because the cell types that are affected typically do not mirror those that are vulnerable in human sporadic PD (24.Farrer M.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 25.Perez F.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sci. 2007; 3: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the various forms of familial PD, as caused by gene mutation, will not contribute to the identification of the final cascade of molecular events that result in degeneration of DA neurons in sporadic PD. In the present study we sought to investigate the impact of RNA interference-mediated silencing of SKP1A, found significantly reduced in sporadic PD SNpc (1.Grünblatt E. Mandel S. Jacob-Hirsch J. Zeligson S. Amariglo N. Rechavi G. Li J. Ravid R. Roggendorf W. Riederer P. Youdim M.B. J. Neural.

The ultimate goal is to develop a genetic model of sporadic PD that recapitulates, at the cellular level, the central molecular pathology occurring in DA neuron degeneration in PD."

Storage of urine prior to analysis, whether due to home collection or bio-banking, is increasingly advocated yet no best practice has emerged. Here, we examined the stability of DNA in stored urine in two populations over 28 days.Urine from 40 (20 male) healthy volunteers from two populations, Italy and Zambia, was stored at four different temperatures (RT, 4 degrees C, -20 degrees C & -80 degrees C) with and without EDTA preservative solution. Urines were extracted at days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 28 after storage. Human DNA content was measured using multi-copy (ALU J) and single copy (TLR2) targets by quantitative real-time PCR. Zambian and Italian samples contained comparable DNA quantity at time zero. Generally, two trends were observed during storage; no degradation, or rapid degradation from days 0 to 7 followed by little further degradation to 28 days. The biphasic degradation was always observed in Zambia regardless of storage conditions, but only twice in Italy.Site-specific differences in urine composition significantly affect the stability of DNA during storage. Assessing the quality of stored urine for molecular analysis, by using the type of strategy described here, is paramount before these samples are used for molecular prognostic monitoring, genetic analyses and disease diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2053634917,"The ability of the transcription factor NF-kappaB to upregulate anti-apoptotic proteins has been linked to the chemoresistance of solid tumors to standard chemotherapy. In contrast, recent studies have proposed that, in response to doxorubicin, NF-kappaB can be pro-apoptotic through repression of anti-apoptotic target genes. However, there is little evidence analyzing the outcome of NF-kappaB inhibition on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in studies describing pro-apoptotic NF-kappaB activity. In this study, we further characterize the activation of NF-kappaB in response to doxorubicin and evaluate its role in chemotherapy-induced cell death in sarcoma cells where NF-kappaB is reported to be pro-apoptotic. Doxorubicin treatment in U2OS cells induced canonical NF-kappaB activity as evidenced by increased nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated p65 at serine 536 and increased DNA-binding activity. Co-treatment with a small molecule IKKbeta inhibitor, Compound A, abrogated this response. RT-PCR evaluation of anti-apoptotic gene expression revealed that doxorubicin-induced transcription of cIAP2 was inhibited by Compound A, while doxorubicin-induced repression of other anti-apoptotic genes was unaffected by Compound A or siRNA to p65. Furthermore, the combination of doxorubicin and canonical NF-kappaB inhibition with Compound A or siRNA to p65 resulted in decreased cell viability measured by trypan blue staining and MTS assay and increased apoptosis measured by cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and cleaved caspase 3 when compared to doxorubicin alone. Our results demonstrate that doxorubicin-induced canonical NF-kappaB activity associated with phosphorylated p65 is anti-apoptotic in its function and that doxorubicin-induced repression of anti-apoptotic genes occurs independent of p65. Therefore, combination therapies incorporating NF-kappaB inhibitors together with standard chemotherapies remains a viable method to improve the clinical outcomes in patients with advanced stage malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2008343636,"Background Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is a parasitic disease of worldwide significance affecting human and animals. As schistosome eggs are responsible for pathogenesis, the understanding of processes controlling gonad development might open new perspectives for intervention. The Src-like tyrosine-kinase SmTK3 of Schistosoma mansoni is expressed in the gonads, and its pharmacological inhibition reduces mitogenic activity and egg production in paired females in vitro. Since Src kinases are important signal transduction proteins it is of interest to unravel the signaling cascades SmTK3 is involved in to understand its cellular role in the gonads. Methodology and Results Towards this end we established and screened a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library of adult S. mansoni with a bait construct encoding the SH3 (src homology) domain and unique site of SmTK3. Among the binding partners found was a diaphanous homolog (SmDia), which was characterized further. SmDia is a single-copy gene transcribed throughout development with a bias towards male transcription. Its deduced amino acid sequence reveals all diaphanous-characteristic functional domains. Binding studies with truncated SmDia clones identified SmTK3 interaction sites demonstrating that maximal binding efficiency depends on the N-terminal part of the FH1 (formin homology) domain and the inter-domain region of SmDia located upstream of FH1 in combination with the unique site and the SH3 domain of SmTK3, respectively. SmDia also directly interacted with the GTPase SmRho1 of S. mansoni. In situ hybridization experiments finally demonstrated that SmDia, SmRho1, and SmTK3 are transcribed in the gonads of both genders. Conclusion These data provide first evidence for the existence of two cooperating pathways involving Rho and Src that bridge at SmDia probably organizing cytoskeletal events in the reproductive organs of a parasite, and beyond that in gonads of eukaryotes. Furthermore, the FH1 and inter domain region of SmDia have been discovered as binding sites for the SH3 and unique site domains of SmTK3, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2055334423,"Prion diseases are neurodegenerative diseases associated with the accumulation of a pathogenic isoform of the host-encoded prion protein. The cellular responses to prion infection are not well defined. By performing microarray analysis on cultured neuronal cells infected with prion strain 22L, in the group of up-regulated genes we observed predominantly genes of the cholesterol pathway. Increased transcript levels of at least nine enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis, including the gene for the rate-limiting hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, were detected. Up-regulation of cholesterogenic genes was attributable to a prion-dependent increase in the amount and activity of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein Srebp2, resulting in elevated levels of total and free cellular cholesterol. The up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis appeared to be a characteristic response of neurons to prion challenge, as cholesterogenic transcripts were also elevated in persistently infected GT-1 cells and prion-exposed primary hippocampal neurons but not in microglial cells and primary astrocytes.

However, no conclusive interpretation of the role of specific pathways altered by prion infection could be drawn. This might at least in part be due to the following: (a) different microarray platforms; (b) different prion strains; (c) different sampling time points during the course of infection; or (d) mixed cell populations. To better understand the neuronal response to prion infection, we performed a highly controlled genome-wide microarray analysis of paired populations of infected and mock-infected N2a cells, using the mouse-adapted scrapie strain 22L. Our statistical transcriptome analysis identified over 100 significantly and differentially expressed genes with putative function. Within the group of up-regulated genes, genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake predominated in prion-infected cells. Transcription of genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis and cholesterol uptake is tightly controlled by transcription factor Srebp2 that induces expression upon binding to the sterol regulatory element (SRE) in the promoter region of relevant genes (17Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Upon cholesterol depletion, Srebp2 is proteolytically cleaved to its active form and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to SRE in promoters of target genes participating in cholesterol metabolism. This way, Srebp2 activates cholesterol biosynthesis by increasing gene expression of individual target genes at every step of the pathway (17Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Commun. 2001; 286: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Srebp2 is able to control its own synthesis by a positive feedback mechanism (20Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takano T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26461-26464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and also regulates expression of the low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr), which is the main receptor for extracellular cholesterol acquisition in mammalian cells (17Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Real time PCR and reporter gene assays confirmed up-regulation of cholesterogenic genes in prion-infected neuronal cells, including the gene for Srebp2, which was also reflected by increased cholesterol levels. Importantly, primary hippocampal neurons also exhibited elevated cholesterol biosynthesis transcripts upon exposure to prions. Up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis appeared to be a characteristic neuronal response, as a microglial cell line and primary astrocytes did not show increased levels of cholesterogenic transcripts in response to prion exposure. Thus, our results suggest that prions differentially alter cholesterol homeostasis in a cell type-specific manner. abnormal prion protein associated with prion disease cellular prion protein fetal calf serum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sterol regulatory element bovine serum albumin small interfering RNA low density lipoprotein receptor. Mouse antibody 4H11 directed against murine PrP has been described previously (21Ertmer A. Gilch S. Yun S.W. Flechsig E. Klebl B. Stein-Gerlach M. Klein M.A. Schätzl H.M. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Srebp2 (ab28482) and anti-Ldlr (ab30532) were purchased from Abcam plc (Cambridge, UK). Mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (MAB374) was from Millipore/Chemicon (Billerica, MA). Mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2a (ATCC, CCL-131) was maintained in Opti-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The medium was exchanged every 48 h. Infection of cells was performed as described previously with small modifications (23Vorberg I. Raines A. Story B. Priola S.A. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For exposure of N2a cell clones to prions, brain homogenates from 22L-infected terminally sick C57BL/6 mice or from uninfected mice were used. Brains were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline using 0.9-mm gauge needles (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and diluted to a final concentration of 10%. Cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well in 1 ml of medium. The following day the medium was replaced by 900 μl of fresh medium and 100 μl of brain homogenate (10%). 24 h post-infection, the brain homogenate was discarded, and cells were subsequently cultured. For Western blot analysis and RNA isolation, cells were always harvested when confluent. Murine microglial cell line BV-2 was challenged with RML or 22L prions as described previously (24Gilch S. Schmitz F. Aguib Y. Kehler C. Bülow S. Bauer S. Kremmer E. Schätzl H.M. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 5834-5844Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, brain homogenates from terminally sick CD-1 mice (RML-infected) or C57BL/6 mice (22L infected) or normal mice were diluted to 1% in RPMI 1640 medium, 7.5% FCS (ultra low endotoxin), 50 μm mercaptoethanol, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were exposed to uninfected brain homogenate, 22L- or RML-infected brain homogenate for 24 h, and RNA was extracted. Primary neurons from hippocampi and astrocytes of C57B/L6 embryonic mice (gestation day 16) were prepared as described elsewhere (25Lopes M.H. Hajj G.N. Muras A.G. Mancini G.L. Castro R.M. Ribeiro K.C. Brentani R.R. Linden R. Martins V.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11330-11339Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, hippocampi were excised, incubated with trypsin, and rinsed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) complemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Single cell suspensions were obtained by mechanical dissociation. Approximately 1 × 106 viable cells were plated in poly-l-lysine-coated 6 wells in neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 and antibiotics (Invitrogen). 10 μm of the antimitotics uridine and fluorodeoxyuridine (Sigma) were added to prevent astrocyte proliferation (26Cronier S. Beringue V. Bellon A. Peyrin J.M. Laude H. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 13794-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Weekly, one-third of the medium was replaced with fresh medium. For isolation of primary astrocytes, meninges were removed, and hemispheres were rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and dissected mechanically. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FCS and rinsed thoroughly every other day with phosphate-buffered saline for 1 week. Established neuronal cultures showed typical neuronal growth and expressed neuron-specific marker protein neurofilaments (data not shown). Astrocyte cultures showed contact inhibition upon confluence and abundantly expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein (data not shown). Primary neurons were exposed to 0.1% brain homogenates (final concentration; mock and 22L) 1 day post-plating and astrocytes shortly before reaching confluence. The next day the medium of the neuronal populations was sterile-filtered to remove homogenate debris. Astrocytes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline 1 day after infection, and the medium was changed every 3 days. Cells were cultured for up to 3–4 weeks. Cells were assayed for PrPSc content as described previously (22Maas E. Geissen M. Groschup M.H. Rost R. Onodera T. Schätzl H. Vorberg I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18702-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All cell lysates were measured for protein content with the Bradford assay (Pierce). For normalization purposes, blots were stripped with stripping buffer (0.1 m glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 2.2) and re-probed with mouse monoclonal antibody directed against GAPDH (MAB374; Millipore/Chemicon). For detection of Srebp2, cells were lysed (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) on ice for 10 min. Lysates were cleared of cell debris (20,000 × g, 1 min at room temperature). Samples were run on 7.5% gels, and Srebp2 or Ldlr and GAPDH were detected on the same Western blot. After densitometric analysis of the band intensities, Srebp2 and Ldlr levels were normalized to GAPDH levels on the same Western blot. cDNA microarrays were produced at the Helmholtz Zentrum München (German Research Center for Environment and Health) and contain the fully sequenced 20,000 cDNA mouse array-TAG library (Lion Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany) and several hundred additional clones for genes not included in the commercial clone set. A full description of the probes on the microarrays has been submitted to the GEO data base (GPL3697). The RNA isolation, reverse transcription, fluorescent labeling, chip hybridization, and data analysis were done as described recently (27Horsch M. Schädler S. Gailus-Durner V. Fuchs H. Meyer H. de Angelis M.H. Beckers J. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 1248-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The expression data have been submitted to the GEO data base (GSE7119). Candidate genes were classified based on the relationship of their gene products to one or more functions. Classification was performed using the definitions in the LION and ENSEMBL data bases. BiblioSphere PathwayEdition (Genomatix, Munich, Germany) was used to calculate complete networks and rank pathway interactions by z scoring on the basis of Genomatix Knowledge Base Ontology. The over-representation of genes is calculated as a z score based on the expected number of genes within the filter category (Gene Ontology). Biological filtering was used to restrict the network to genes that are assigned to the biological function of the respective genes. RNA samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform or the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and treated with RNase-free DNase I. RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript II reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. Quantitative real time PCR experiments for each gene were performed in triplicate using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). The 2−ΔΔCT method (28Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar, 29Radonic A. Thulke S. Mackay I.M. Landt O. Siegert W. Nitsche A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the relative expression levels. Each result was normalized to RNA Polymerase II (RPII). As the minimum detectable change, we used a 2-fold expression difference (30Bubner B. Gase K. Baldwin I.T. BMC Biotechnol. 2004; 4: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and considered only expression differences equal to or higher than 2-fold as significant. Cells were plated at a density of 1.3 × 105 cells per 12 wells and co-transfected with the luciferase plasmid psynSRE-Luc harboring the sterol-responsive element (31Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (1.6 μg) and transfection control pGL2 Renilla plasmid (160 ng; Promega) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent. The dual luciferase reporter assay (E1910, Promega) was used to measure the bioluminescence 24 h post-transfection, and cell lysates were analyzed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity. Relative bioluminescence generated by firefly luciferase was normalized to the bioluminescence generated by the Renilla luciferase. Cell pellets were resuspended in 3 m aqueous solution of guanidine hydrochloride to inactivate prion infectivity. Water was added; the samples were sonicated for 30 s, and the protein content was determined (32Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). After subsequent addition of 4 ml of methanol and 3 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (10:5:1, v/v), lipids were extracted for 24 h at 37 °C. The liquid phase was separated by filtration. The solvent was evaporated in a stream of nitrogen, and the residues were desalted by reversed phase chromatography on LiChroprep RP18 (Merck) columns (33Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Lipids were applied to high performance thin layer chromatography silica gel 60 plates (Merck), which were pre-washed twice with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) and air-dried for 30 min. Each lane of the TLC plate was loaded with the equivalent of 600 μg of protein. For quantification of free cholesterol, the TLC solvent system used was chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (190:9:1, v/v). For the quantification of the total cholesterol content, cholesteryl esters were cleaved by alkaline hydrolysis with 2.5 ml of a 100 mm solution of sodium hydroxide in methanol for 2 h at 37 °C. After neutralization with acetic acid, the mixtures were desalted again on RP18 columns. Lipids were separated into acidic and neutral fractions by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose columns (GE Healthcare) (34Momoi T. Ando S. Magai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The lipid mixture was solved in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (3:7:1, v/v) and applied to the columns. Neutral lipids were eluted with 7 ml of the same solvent, and then acidic lipids were eluted with 8 ml of chloroform, methanol, 0.8 m ammonium acetate in water (3:7:1, v/v). Neutral lipids were applied to pre-washed high performance thin layer chromatography plates, loading each lane with the equivalent of 400 μg of protein. The TLC plates were developed in chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (190:9:1, v/v). For quantitative analytical TLC determination, increasing amounts of standard cholesterol (Sigma) were applied to the TLC plates in addition to the lipid samples. After development, plates were dried under reduced pressure. For detection of lipid bands, the TLC plates were sprayed with a phosphoric acid/copper sulfate reagent (15.6 g of CuSO4(H2O)5 and 9.4 ml of H3PO4 (85%, w/v) in 100 ml of water) and charred at 180 °C for 10 min (35Yao J.K. Rastetter G.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lipid bands were then quantified using a photo-densitometer (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) at a wavelength of 595 nm. Cells were transfected with siRNAs directed against the murine Srebp2 (SI01433131 and SI01433138, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or Ldlr (Sc35803, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or nonsilencing siRNA (AllStars Negative Control siRNA, 1027281, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were subsequently cultured in serum-free Opti-MEM medium supplemented with antibiotics and 0.2 μm mevalonate. In additional experiments, cells were transfected with siRNA and subsequently cultured in the presence of 10% FCS or BSA (5% w/v) and cholesterol (0.1% v/v). BSA (A-4503, fraction V) and cholesterol (C3045, stock solution 35 mg/ml in absolute ethanol) were obtained from Sigma. After 48 h, cells were detached and split into two samples. Cells were lysed in two different buffers for detection of PrPSc, PrPC, Ldlr, and GAPDH (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate) or Srebp2 (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and GAPDH. Photodensitometric analysis of signals on Western blots was performed using the ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). Quantitative data are shown as mean ± S.D. For evaluation of statistical significance of the data, we used the paired t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered as significant. To characterize the host cell response to 22L prion infection, N2a cells were cloned by limiting dilution, and the resultant cell clones were subsequently exposed to 1% 22L brain homogenate (supplemental Fig. 1A). Clone 5, which displayed a high PrPSc signal upon exposure to prions, was chosen for microarray experiments (supplemental Fig. 1B). Subclones of clone 5 were analyzed by Western blot for proteinase K-resistant PrP, and the infection rate was estimated to be ∼70% (supplemental Fig. 1C). The differential gene expression pattern of 22L prion-infected N2a cells (ScN2a) was compared with that of mock-infected cells using a genome-wide cDNA microarray. Mock-infected and 22L prion-infected cells were passaged 18 times under identical culture conditions to exclude any influences of residual brain homogenate or passage history on gene expression. A competitive hybridization was performed between RNA isolated from infected cells and RNA from mock-infected cells, including color flip experiments. In total, eight microarrays were hybridized. Statistical analysis revealed that in total 203 genes were significantly differentially regulated with a d(i) >4, a score assigned to each gene on the basis of changes in gene expression levels relative to the standard deviation. Reproducible differential expression was found for all microarray experiments. The number of false positives per 100 permutations was estimated as a false discovery rate of 0% for each data set. For 37 genes, increased expression levels were identified, although 166 genes were down-regulated. Differentially transcribed genes were classified according to the biological function of their gene products based on definitions in the LION and ENSEMBL data bases. Functional information was limited or absent for some of the candidate genes. For 27 up- and 94 down-regulated genes, a putative function is known or has been suggested (supplemental Table 1). BiblioSphere software (Genomatix, Munich, Germany) was used to analyze and filter for Gene Ontology categories to integrate differentially regulated genes into pathways. BiblioSphere generated a list of biological process terms ranked by their probability of over- or under-representation in a specific gene list. z scores indicate how the results deviate from the distribution mean. Thus, it ranks the probability that the genes in this category are over- or under-represented in the gene list. The supplemental Table 2 lists biological processes over-represented within the group of down-regulated genes. Within the group of up-regulated genes, the lipid biosynthetic process was highly over-represented (Table 1), and genes of this GO term mainly belonged to the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Notably, transcripts for the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (Srebp2) (Srebf2, 3.25) were increased. Furthermore, Ldlr transcripts were increased almost 4-fold in prion-infected N2a cells.TABLE 1Classification of differentially expressed genes by biological processes Microarray analysis is expected to underestimate the changes in expression of genes relative to real time PCR. For independent validation of microarray results, real time PCR analysis of cholesterogenic genes was performed. Srebp2 (gene Srebf2), as well as the genes for farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (Fdft1), C4-sterol methyl oxidase (Sc4mol), and Ldlr, was chosen based on substantial changes in expression levels as detected by microarray analysis. To elucidate if expression of further cholesterogenic genes was altered upon prion infection, relative expression levels of candidate genes mevalonate kinase (Mvk) and cytochrome p450 family 51 (Cyp51) were evaluated. Overall, the real time PCR results were highly consistent with the array results, demonstrating an up-regulation of all studied genes (Fig. 1A). In conclusion, we identified cholesterol biosynthesis as a main pathway up-regulated upon 22L prion infection of N2a cells (Fig. 1B). To study if prion infection leads to elevated expression of cholesterogenic genes in another neuronal cell line, the relative expression levels of Srebf2, Sc4mol, and Ldlr in RML prion strain-infected or uninfected GT-1 cells (12Greenwood A.D. Horsch M. Stengel A. Vorberg I. Lutzny G. Maas E. Schädler S. Erfle V. Beckers J. Schätzl H. Leib-Mösch C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were compared by real time PCR. Western blot analysis of RML-infected GT-1 cells prior to RNA isolation demonstrated that cells accumulated substantial amounts of PrPSc (data not shown). Transcript levels of all three genes were found increased in infected GT-1 cells compared with uninfected cells (Fig. 2A). Thus, these results strongly suggest that up-regulation of cholesterol metabolism-related genes is a general neuronal response to prion infection that might be independent of the prion strain.FIGURE 2Up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis transcripts in neuronal cell lines. A, quantitative Srebf2, Ldlr, and Sc4mol expression levels in RML-infected and un-infected GT1 cells determined by real time PCR, normalized to the housekeeping gene RPII.

However, in the same study, a strong inflammatory reaction was evident, suggesting that the observed changes in gene expression reflect a profound microglial activation that could obscure potential transcriptional changes in neurons. Interestingly, microglial cells do not appear to become infected with prions in vivo (37Priller J. Prinz M. Heikenwalder M. Zeller N. Schwarz P. Heppner F.L. Aguzzi A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11753-11762Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To test if prion exposure could impact cholesterol biosynthesis in microglial cells, relative transcript levels of Srebf2 and Sc4mol in murine BV-2 cells that had been exposed to 22L or RML prion strains or normal brain homogenate for 1 day (24Gilch S.

We show that PAP depurinated nucleotides within the gag open reading frame and suppressed the synthesis of viral proteins in part by decreasing the translational efficiency of HTLV-I gag/pol mRNA. Observed reduction in levels of viral mRNAs were not due to enhanced degradation; rather, decreased amounts of viral transactivator protein, Tax, led to feed-back inhibition of transcription from the viral promoter. Therefore, PAP efficiently suppressed HTLV-I gene expression at both translational and transcriptional levels, resulting in substantially diminished virus production. Significantly, no changes in viability or rates of cellular transcription or translation were observed in cells expressing PAP, indicating that this protein was not toxic.

The latter is a chronic and progressive disease of the nervous system, characterized by muscle weakness and sensory disturbance (2Gessain A. Barin F. Vernant J.C. Gout O. Maurs L. Calender A. de Thé G. Lancet. 1985; 2: 407-410Abstract PubMed Scopus (2399) Google Scholar, 3Osame M. Matsumoto M. Usuku K. Izumo S. Ijichi N. Amitani H. Tara M. Igata A. Ann. Neurol. 1987; 21: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). HTLV-I-infected individuals have a 2–3% estimated lifetime risk of developing adult T-cell leukemia, with a period of latency from 20 to 30 years (4Yamaguchi K. Takatsuki K. Clin. Haematol. 1993; 6: 899-915Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Tokudome S. Tokunaga O. Shimamoto Y. Miyamoto Y. Sumida I. Kikuchi M. Takeshita M. Ikeda T. Fujiwara K. Yoshihara M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 226-228PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of those infected with HTLV-I are therefore asymptomatic (6Tajima K. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), because the virus maintains the expression of its genes at very low or undetectable levels. As a result, HTLV-I is not efficiently targeted by the immune system (7Yoshida M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 475-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and leukemia progresses after clonal expansion of T-cells infected with the virus (8Taylor G.P. Matsuoka M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6047-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 9Franchini G. Nicot C. Johnson J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2003; 89: 69-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Due to the long period of latency prior to onset of leukemia, the disease appears mainly in individuals who have been infected with HTLV-I early in life (10Murphy E.L. Hanchard B. Figueroa J.P. Gibbs W.N. Lofters W.S. Campbell M. Goedert J.J. Blattner W.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 11Takatsuki K. Yamaguchi K. Kawano F. Hattori T. Nishimura H. Tsuda H. Sanada I. Nakada K. Itai Y. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 4644s-4645sPubMed Google Scholar). The virus is transmitted through body fluids, including breast milk (12Höllsberg P. Hafler D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 13Moriuchi M. Inoue H. Moriuchi H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); therefore, mother-to-child transmission poses substantial risk for development of leukemia. Various forms of cytotoxic chemotherapy are currently used to treat adult T-cell leukemia; however, prognosis is poor, because the disease is aggressive, with a mean survival time of only 6 months. Few published accounts address the potential of antiretroviral therapy for limiting viral gene expression and/or inhibiting replication to reduce the viral load in individuals early after infection, which in turn would reduce the chances for progression of leukemia (14Gill P.S. Harrington Jr., W. Kaplan M.H. Ribeiro R.C. Bennett J.M. Liebman H.A. Bernstein-Singer M. Espina B.M. Cabral L. Allen S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 15Machuca A. Soriano V. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2000; 24: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).In this report, we investigated the antiviral activity of a plant-derived protein against HTLV-I. Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) is a ribosome-inactivating protein synthesized by Phytolacca americana, the pokeweed plant (16Irvin J.D. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Like all ribosome-inactivating proteins, PAP is a glycosidase that removes a specific adenine base from the large ribosomal RNA (17Endo Y. Tsurugi K. Lambert J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This depurination has traditionally been cited as the reason for antiviral activity, because resulting inhibition of host cell translation would limit virus proliferation (18Foà-Tomasi L. Campadelli-Fiume G. Barbieri L. Stirpe F. Arch. Virol. 1982; 71: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, mutants of the protein have been expressed that maintain antiviral activity in the absence of rRNA depurination, thereby separating the effect on viruses from host cell translation (19Picard D. Kao C.C. Hudak K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20069-20075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Tumer N.E. Hwang D.J. Bonness M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3866-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Pokeweed antiviral protein has been shown to depurinate some viral RNAs, indicating that antiviral activity may be due to broader substrate specificity that is not limited to rRNA depurination (21Hudak K.A. Wang P. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Incubation of purified PAP with lymphocytes prior to their infection with HIV-I reduced the number of virus particles released into the medium (22Zarling J.M. Moran P.A. Haffar O. Sias J. Richman D.D. Spina C.A. Myers D.E. Kuebelbeck V. Ledbetter J.A. Uckun F.M. Nature. 1990; 347: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, incubation of HIV-I genomic RNA with purified PAP resulted in release of purines, suggesting that PAP depurinated the RNA in this assay (23Rajamohan F. Venkatachalam T.K. Irvin J.D. Uckun F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); however, the effect of PAP on retroviral gene expression in cells has not been described. Accordingly, our goal was to examine whether PAP is able to target and inhibit HTLV-I and to determine the mechanism of such activity.We show here that PAP efficiently inhibited HTLV-I gene expression at both translational and transcriptional levels in the absence of host cell toxicity. PAP depurinated nucleotides within the gag open reading frame of genomic RNA and reduced its translational efficiency in vitro. Decreased amounts of the viral transactivator protein, Tax, led to feed-back inhibition of HTLV-I gene expression, diminishing gag/pol, env, and tax/rex mRNA levels. Due to this combined effect, PAP significantly reduced virus production.DISCUSSIONPAP exhibits antiviral activity against a number of different viruses; however, the mechanistic details of this activity have not been described (19Picard D. Kao C.C. Hudak K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20069-20075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Zarling J.M. Moran P.A. Haffar O. Sias J. Richman D.D. Spina C.A. Myers D.E. Kuebelbeck V. Ledbetter J.A. Uckun F.M. Nature. 1990; 347: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 36Tomlinson J.A. Walker V.M. Flewett T.H. Barclay G.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1974; 22: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As a ribosome-inactivating protein, PAP also depurinates a conserved adenine within the sarcin/ricin loop of the large rRNA, which has been reported to inhibit the binding of elongation factor 2 and slow the rate of elongation during protein translation (37Stirpe F. Bailey S. Miller S.P. Bodley J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 38Gessner S.L. Irvin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3251-3253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Nilsson L. Nygård O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This inhibition of translation has traditionally been cited to explain antiviral activity, because a positive correlation has been shown between ribosome depurination and decline of virus infection (18Foà-Tomasi L. Campadelli-Fiume G. Barbieri L. Stirpe F. Arch. Virol. 1982; 71: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Taylor S. Massiah A. Lomonossoff G. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Hartley M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, very few ribosome-inactivating proteins are antiviral, suggesting that merely inhibiting ribosomes does not impart antiviral qualities. Moreover, our results show that PAP inhibited HTLV-I gene expression in the absence of cytotoxicity. In addition to their potential to inhibit translation, many ribosome-inactivating proteins induce a ribotoxic stress response that results in cell death (41Narayanan S. Surolia A. Karande A.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 42Ouyang D.Y. Wang Y.Y. Zheng Y.T. Cell Mol. Immunol. 2005; 2: 419-425PubMed Google Scholar). This response is characterized by damage to the rRNA, which triggers activation of a stress-induced kinase that may culminate in programmed cell death (43Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we have demonstrated previously that PAP expression in 293T cells resulted in cell survival rather than apoptosis (28Chan Tung K.W. Mansouri S. Hudak K.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 2452-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the current study, the amount of PAP expression that caused 100-fold decline in HTLV-I protein levels was not sufficient to be toxic to cells, although 16% of the 28 S rRNA was depurinated. This level of rRNA depurination did not affect the rate of cellular translation, indicating that reduction in the level of viral proteins was not due to general defects in the cellular translation machinery as a result of rRNA depurination. Together with our findings indicating minimal PAP effect on cellular transcription rates, we conclude that antiviral activity was not a consequence of cytotoxicity.In addition to demonstrating lack of harm to host cells, examining the potential of PAP as a therapeutic option to limit HTLV-I progression would require understanding the steps in the virus life cycle affected by depurination. Here, we describe the mechanism through which PAP inhibited virus production (Fig. 8). Specifically, transient expression of PAP in 293T cells caused a substantial decline in the level of intracellular Gag and virus-associated p19 matrix protein and intracellular Tax protein. We show that the 5′ region of the gag/pol mRNA was depurinated by PAP and that this mRNA was less efficiently translated in a cell-free system, suggesting that depurination contributed to diminished levels of viral proteins. We have shown previously that depurination of Brome mosaic virus RNA3 caused ribosomes to stall at the missing base during elongation (32Gandhi R. Manzoor M. Hudak K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32218-32228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Expression of PAP also reduced HTLV-I gag/pol, env, and tax/rex mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Decreased tax/rex mRNA levels may have also resulted in diminished Rex synthesis, which in turn would have reduced the amount of cytoplasmic gag/pol mRNA for translation. Therefore, post-transcriptional effects of PAP contributed to the decline in viral protein synthesis. Diminished levels of viral mRNAs were not due to enhanced degradation but rather were probably caused by limited synthesis, based on the results of our reporter assay. HTLV-I Tax protein is encoded from the HTLV-I doubly spliced tax/rex mRNA and is the transactivator of the viral promoter located within the 5′-LTR (35Sodroski J. Rosen C. Goh W.C. Haseltine W. Science. 1985; 228: 1430-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Since Tax is required for enhanced transcription from the viral promoter, we expected that undetectable Tax would result in decreased levels of all HTLV-I-encoded mRNAs. Therefore, feedback inhibition of viral gene expression manifested as an efficient decline in the level of viral mRNAs and proteins, hence the significant reduction in virus production.Apart from pokeweed antiviral protein, other enzymes exist that modify the genomes of some viruses. For example, APOBEC3G is a family member of cytidine deaminases that acts as a host defense factor against some retroviruses (reviewed in Refs. 44Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar and 45Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These enzymes convert cytosines of negative-strand viral cDNA to uracils during reverse transcription, resulting in guanosine to adenosine hypermutations in the coding strand (46Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 47Zhang H. Yang B. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang C. Arunachalam S.C. Gao L. Nature. 2003; 424: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 48Harris R.S. Sheehy A.M. Craig H.M. Malim M.H. Neuberger M.S. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The uracil-containing cDNA may be targeted for degradation, or fixation of hypermutation in proviral sequences may result in synthesis of inactive or truncated viral proteins. HTLV-I appears to be relatively resistant to the antiviral effects of APOBEC3G, and mutations of guanosines to adenosines are rarely observed (49Ohsugi T. Koito A. J. Virol. Methods. 2007; 139: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a peptide motif in the C terminus of HTLV-I Nucleocapsid protein has been shown to inhibit ABOBEC3G packaging into nascent virions, thereby limiting its antiviral effect (50Derse D. Hill S.A. Princler G. Lloyd P. Heidecker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, HTLV-I appears to evade this cellular factor that causes mutation of its genome. We hypothesize that evolution of virus resistance to pokeweed antiviral protein may be difficult, given that the timing of the PAP effect described here does not rely on the protein being packaged into viral particles and that no mechanisms for repair of depurinated RNA have been described. The subsequent decline in protein synthesis from the damaged viral RNA and its effect on transcriptional and post-transcriptional events suggest that PAP may have an application as part of an antiviral strategy in the future.

HTLV-I-infected individuals have a 2–3% estimated lifetime risk of developing adult T-cell leukemia, with a period of latency from 20 to 30 years (4Yamaguchi K. Takatsuki K. Clin.

https://openalex.org/W2072201965,"Interactions between Bcl-2 homology-3 (BH3)-only proteins and their pro-survival Bcl-2 family binding partners initiate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. These interactions are mediated by a short helical motif, the BH3 domain, on the BH3-only protein, which inserts into a hydrophobic groove on the pro-survival molecule. To identify novel peptidic ligands that bind Mcl-1, a pro-survival protein relative of Bcl-2, both human and mouse Mcl-1 were screened against large randomized phage-displayed peptide libraries. We identified a number of 16-mer peptides with sub-micromolar affinity that were highly selective for Mcl-1, as well as being somewhat selective for the species of Mcl-1 (human or mouse) against which the library was panned. Interestingly, these sequences all strongly resembled natural BH3 domain sequences. By switching residues within the best of the human Mcl-1-binding sequences, or extending beyond the core sequence identified, we were able to alter the pro-survival protein interaction profile of this peptide such that it now bound all members tightly and was a potent killer when introduced into cells. Introduction of an amide lock constraint within this sequence also increased its helicity and binding to pro-survival proteins. These data provide new insights into the determinants of BH3 domain:pro-survival protein affinity and selectivity."

https://openalex.org/W1987358818,"Background Increasing energy expenditure at the cellular level offers an attractive option to limit adiposity and improve whole body energy balance. In vivo and in vitro observations have correlated mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) expression with reduced white adipose tissue triglyceride (TG) content. The metabolic basis for this correlation remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings This study tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial uncoupling requires the cell to compensate for the decreased oxidation phosphorylation efficiency by up-regulating lactate production, thus redirecting carbon flux away from TG synthesis. Metabolic flux analysis was used to characterize the effects of non-lethal, long-term mitochondrial uncoupling (up to 18 days) on the pathways of intermediary metabolism in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Uncoupling was induced by forced expression of UCP1 and chemical (FCCP) treatment. Chemical uncoupling significantly decreased TG content by ca. 35%. A reduction in the ATP level suggested diminished oxidative phosphorylation efficiency in the uncoupled adipocytes. Flux analysis estimated significant up-regulation of glycolysis and down-regulation of fatty acid synthesis, with chemical uncoupling exerting quantitatively larger effects. Conclusions/Significance The results of this study support our hypothesis regarding uncoupling-induced redirection of carbon flux into glycolysis and lactate production, and suggest mitochondrial proton translocation as a potential target for controlling adipocyte lipid metabolism."

The present investigation evaluated the effect of CAS in patients with high-grade stenosis and assessed the predictive value of ischemic lesion number for postinterventional cognitive deterioration.22 patients were tested neuropsychologically before and six weeks after CAS. Cerebral ischemic changes were assessed with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) prior to and after angioplasty.Pre- to postinterventional cognitive performance improved significantly in terms of verbal memory (t = -2.30; p<0.05), whereas significant deterioration was noted regarding verbal memory span (t = 2.31; p<0.05). 8 (36%) persons conformed to the criteria of cognitive improvement. 6 patients (27%) were postinterventionally classified as having deficits. Analysis yielded no statistically significant correlations between lesion quantity and cognitive change.Both improvement and deterioration of cognitive functioning was observed in our collective of patients, leaving the neuropsychological outcome after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty unpredictable in individual cases. The presence of acute ischemic lesions on DWI was found to be not tightly associated with cognitive dysfunction after CAS."
https://openalex.org/W2004012884,"Heat shock proteins of 70 kDa (Hsp70s) and their J domain-containing Hsp40 cofactors are highly conserved chaperone pairs that facilitate a large number of cellular processes. The observation that each Hsp70 partners with many J domain-containing proteins (JDPs) has led to the hypothesis that Hsp70 function is dictated by cognate JDPs. If this is true, one might expect highly divergent Hsp70-JDP pairs to be unable to function in vivo. However, we discovered that, when a yeast cytosolic JDP, Ydj1, was targeted to the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it interacted with the ER-lumenal Hsp70, BiP, and bound to BiP substrates. Conversely, when a mammalian ER-lumenal JDP, ERdj3, was directed to the yeast cytosol, it rescued the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of yeast-containing mutant alleles in two cytosolic JDPs, HLJ1 and YDJ1, and activated the ATP hydrolysis rate of Ssa1, the yeast cytosolic Hsp70 that partners with Hlj1 and Ydj1. Surprisingly, ERdj3 mutants that were compromised for substrate binding were unable to rescue the hlj1ydj1 growth defect even though they stimulated the ATPase activity of Ssa1. Yet, J domain mutants of ERdj3 that were defective for interaction with Ssa1 restored the growth of hlj1ydj1 yeast. Taken together, these data suggest that the substrate binding properties of certain JDPs, not simply the formation of unique Hsp70-JDP pairs, are critical to specify in vivo function.

Conversely, when a mammalian ER-lumenal JDP, ERdj3, was directed to the yeast cytosol, it rescued the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of yeast-containing mutant alleles in two cytosolic JDPs, HLJ1 and YDJ1, and activated the ATP hydrolysis rate of Ssa1, the yeast cytosolic Hsp70 that partners with Hlj1 and Ydj1. Surprisingly, ERdj3 mutants that were compromised for substrate binding were unable to rescue the hlj1ydj1 growth defect even though they stimulated the ATPase activity of Ssa1. Yet, J domain mutants of ERdj3 that were defective for interaction with Ssa1 restored the growth of hlj1ydj1 yeast. Taken together, these data suggest that the substrate binding properties of certain JDPs, not simply the formation of unique Hsp70-JDP pairs, are critical to specify in vivo function. Hsp70s 3The abbreviations used are: Hsp70heat shock protein of 70 kDaJDPJ domain-containing proteinERendoplasmic reticulumERADER-associated degradationsssignal sequenceHAhemagglutininTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. constitute a highly conserved family of molecular chaperones that are found in all organisms and in all cellular organelles. Due to their ability to bind to unfolded regions on nascent polypeptides or unassembled subunits of heteromeric complexes in a nucleotide-dependent manner, these chaperones play critical roles in diverse cellular processes (1.Munro S.

The highly conserved ∼70-amino acid J domain of JDPs contacts the nucleotide-binding domain of Hsp70 and enhances ATPase activity by inducing a conformational change (5.Gässler C.S. Buchberger A.

Moreover, some JDPs directly bind to unfolded regions on substrate proteins through their substrate-binding domain and deliver the unfolded protein to the ATP-bound form of their Hsp70 partner (7.Rüdiger S.

The JDPs can be classified into three groups (11.Hennessy F. Nicoll W.S. Zimmermann R. Cheetham M.E. Blatch G.L. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12.Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar): (i) type I JDPs are most similar to DnaJ and contain a J domain followed by a glycine/phenylalanine-rich region and a cysteine-rich region with four repeats of a CXXCXGXG-type zinc finger; (ii) type II JDPs lack the cysteine-rich region and are unable to coordinate Zn2+; and (iii) type III JDPs only have the J domain in common with DnaJ. Notably, the number of JDPs exceeds the number of Hsp70s and nucleotide exchange factors in most organisms/organelles. In fact, a single Hsp70 can interact with different JDPs to form unique Hsp70-JDP pairs that participate in specific cellular functions (12.Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 13.Sahi C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7163-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Despite the high conservation of the J domain, JDPs are not necessarily interchangeable between organelles or organisms (11.Hennessy F. Nicoll W.S. Zimmermann R. Cheetham M.E. Blatch G.L. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 14.Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), further suggesting that there is specificity in the interaction between Hsp70s and JDPs. Specificity might be essential for substrate recognition and delivery, for the targeting of Hsp70 to distinct cellular locations, and/or for catalyzing protein folding in distinct chemical environments within organelles. To begin to address this hypothesis, a recent study tested the ability of 13 different JDPs to interact with resident Hsp70s in the yeast cytoplasm (13.Sahi C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7163-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In many cases, the ability of a JDP to stimulate the ATPase activity of a particular Hsp70 was sufficient to constitute a functional pair. However, distinct features of JDPs, such as the ability to interact with substrates, might also be required for specific functions (7.Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 15.Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16.Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To better resolve this apparent discrepancy, we have compared the abilities of two type I JDPs, a mammalian, ER-lumenal protein (ERdj3), and a yeast cytoplasmic protein (Ydj1) to functionally substitute for each other. Our data, combined with those of a previous study (13.Sahi C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7163-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggest that both the binding of JDPs to substrates and their association with Hsp70s are essential to support cell viability and chaperone-dependent function. To target Ydj1 to the mammalian ER, a signal sequence (ss) was engineered onto the N terminus of Ydj1 using pAV4 (18.Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template and the following PCR primers (lowercase letters represent the inserted signal sequence, and the underlined letters indicate a BamHI site): 5′ primer: CGGGATCCatggctccgcagaacctgagcaccttttgcctgttgctgctatacctcatcggggcggtgattgccGTTAAAGAAACTAAGTTTTACGATATTCTAGGTGTTCC, and 3′ primer: CGGGATCCTCATTGAGATGCACATTGAACACCTTC. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and inserted into 3HA-DSL, a mammalian expression vector that was modified from the original pSG5 vector (Neupogen) by the addition of several unique restriction enzyme recognition sequences to the multiple cloning site and a triple-HA encoding sequence at the 3′-end of the multiple cloning site. After determining the direction of insertion, the translation “STOP” codon in ssYdj1-3HA-DSL was destroyed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following primers: 5′ primer: GAAGGTGTTCAATGTGCATCTCAAGGATCCCCGGAATTCCTCGAG, and 3′ primer: CTCGAGGAATTCCGGGGATCCTTGAGATGCACATTGAACACCTTC. Next, a ribosomal-binding Kozak sequence (underlined, see below) was inserted immediately upstream of the translation start site of ssYdj1 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with the following primers: 5′ primer: GTTTAAACGGATCCACCCGGGACAGAGGAACCATGGCTCCGCAGAAC and 3′ primer: GTTCTGCGGAGCCATGGTTCCTCTGTCCCGGGTGGATCCGTTTAAAC. A second construct, ssYdj1C406S, was made in which the farnesylation acceptor site in ssYdj1 was mutated (denoted by the underlined sequence) with the primer pair: 5′ primer: GGTGGCGAAGGTGTTCAAAGTGCATCTCAAGGATCCCCG and 3′ primer: CGGGGATCCTTGAGATGCACTTTGAACACCTTCGCCACC. To target Hlj1 to the mammalian ER, the signal sequence from ERdj3 was engineered onto the N terminus of Hlj1 using yeast genomic DNA as a template and the following PCR primers (lowercase letters represent the inserted signal sequence, and the underlined letters indicate EcoRV and BglII sites in the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively): 5′ primer: CGGATATCACCCGGGACAGAGGAACCatggctccgcagaacctgagcaccttttgcctgttgctgctatacctcatcggggcggtgattgccTCTTTCACTGAGGATCAAGAAAAA, and 3′ primer: GGAGATCTACTAAACAGGTAATCTTTAATCATAGGAAGAACAAT. The PCR product was digested with EcoRV and BglII and inserted into 3HA-DSL. To express ERdj3 in yeast, two constructs were produced under the control of the PGPD promoter in the multicopy pGPD426 vector (19.Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) as follows. (i) Full-length human ERdj3 containing its endogenous ER-targeting was amplified by PCR from the ERdj3-3HA-DSL vector (20.Jin Y. Zhuang M. Hendershot L.M. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with the following primer pair (the underlined letters represent the EcoRI and BamHI sites introduced for cloning purposes): 5′ primer: CGGAATTCGGACCCGGGAC, and 3′ primer: CGGGATCCATATCCTTGCAGTCCATTGTATACCTTCTG. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into pGPD426. (ii) For cytosolic expression, CaaX-ERdj3 was generated using the following primer pair with ERdj3-3HA-DSL serving as the template (the underlined letters on the 5′ primer represent the beginning of the coding sequence for the mature ERdj3 protein without its signal sequence, while the underlined sequence on the 3′ primer represents the farnesylation sequence; the lowercase letters represent the restriction sites used for cloning): 5′ primer: CGggatccGGAACCATGGGACGAGATTTCTATAAGATCTTGGGG, and 3′ primer: CCCaagcttTCATTGAGATGCACATTGCAGTCCATTGTATACCTTCTGC. The resulting PCR product lacked the N-terminal signal sequence and contained a “CASQ” farnesylation sequence in lieu of the final two C-terminal amino acids (GY) in ERdj3. Next, the PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and inserted into pGPD426. All CaaX-ERdj3 mutants were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis using primer pairs previously described (20.Jin Y. Zhuang M. Hendershot L.M. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, for expression of ERdj4 in the yeast ER, full-length ERdj4 was amplified from the pIRES2-EGFP-ERdj4 vector (a kind gift from Timothy Weaver, University of Cincinnati) using the primer pair (the underlined letters represent the EcoRI and HindIII sites introduced for cloning purposes into the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively): 5′ primer: CGGAATCCATGGCTACTCCCCAGTCAATTTTCATCTTTGCA, and 3′ primer: GGAAGCTTCTACTGTCCTGAACAGTCAGTGTATGTAGTAAC. The resulting product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII enzymes and inserted into pGPD426. A cytosolic form of ERdj4 was constructed by amplifying ERdj4 with the primer pair (the underlined letters on the 5′ primer represent the beginning of the coding sequence for the cytosolic form of ERdj4 protein without its signal sequence, while the underlined sequence on the 3′ primer represents the farnesylation sequence; the lowercase letters represent the restriction sites used for cloning): 5′ primer: CGgaatccTTAATTCTGGCCTCAAAAAGCTACTATGATATCTT, and 3′ primer: GGaagcttTCATTTGAGATGCACACTGTCCTGAACAGTCAGTGTATGTAGTAA, digested with the EcoRI and HindIII enzymes, and inserted into the pGPD426 vector. Cells were transfected with the indicated vectors using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). A vector that encodes Chinese hamster BiP has previously been described (21.Hendershot L. Wei J. Gaut J. Melnick J. Aviel S. Argon Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence (22.Chung K.T. Shen Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47557-47563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), transfected cells grown on coverslips were fixed and stained with an anti-HA antibody to detect ssYdj1 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. Grp94, an abundant ER lumenal protein, served as an ER marker and was detected with an anti-Grp94 antiserum (22.Chung K.T. Shen Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47557-47563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) followed by a TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody. To detect interactions between JDPs and either BiP or substrate, 48 h post-transfection, cells were labeled with Tran35S-label (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h, and cell lysates were prepared (20.Jin Y. Zhuang M. Hendershot L.M. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To stabilize protein complexes, cells were treated with 150 μg/ml 3,3′-dithiobispropionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester for 1 h on ice, quenched with 100 μl of 1 m glycine, and lysed in a non-ionic lysing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Solubilized proteins were incubated with the indicated antisera and precipitated with Protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitated complexes were subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis, and after enhancing with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences Bioscience), the signals were detected by chemiluminescence.

The yeast strains were grown to logarithmic phase at 26 °C in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium containing 2% glucose and transformed with the indicated plasmids using lithium acetate (30.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting transformants were isolated and grown to logarithmic phase at 26 °C in selective synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose. 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted onto solid medium and cultured at the indicated temperatures for 2 days. Where indicated, NaCl was included in the medium at a final concentration of 0.4 m, and sorbitol was included at a final concentration of 1 m. Wild-type cells transformed with an empty vector or plasmids expressing ERdj3, ERdj3-CaaX, ERdj4, or ERdj4-CaaX were grown to logarithmic phase (A600 of 0.8–1.0) in selective synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose. A total of ∼200 A600 equivalents of cells were harvested, and ER-derived microsomal membranes were prepared as previously described (31.Nakatsukasa K. Huyer G. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Cell. 2008; 132: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). For protein detection, ∼20 μg of membranes was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were analyzed using a polyclonal anti-ERdj3 antiserum (32.Shen Y. Hendershot L.M. Mol. Biol.

The gene encoding HA-tagged Ste6p* was subcloned from pSM1911 (2μ URA3 PPGK ste6–166::HA) (34.Huyer G. Piluek W.F. Fansler Z. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. Brodsky J.L. Michaelis S. J. Biol.

Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar) to generate the p425-Ste6p*-HA plasmid. To enable selection of p425-Ste6p*-HA in the hlj1Δydj1-151 strain, the LEU2 gene was replaced with the NAT cassette, which confers resistance to the antibiotic nourseothricin, using PCR-mediated gene disruption (36.Lorenz M.C. Muir R.S. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S.C. Heitman J. Gene. 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide chase assays to measure the degradation efficiency of Ste6p* were performed as described before (31.Nakatsukasa K. Huyer G. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Cell. 2008; 132: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) at 37 °C. Luciferase refolding assays were performed as described (37.Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y. Young J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3414-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The luminescence was measured in an analytical luminescence laboratory luminometer (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The molar amounts of Hsp70s and JDPs present in the reaction are indicated in the figure legends. To better understand the restrictions guiding the formation of functional Hsp70-JDP pairs, we first asked whether Ydj1, a cytosolic yeast JDP, could interact with BiP/Grp78, the mammalian ER-lumenal Hsp70. Ydj1 is a type I JDP and bears an overall sequence identity of 37% to ERdj3, a cognate BiP JDP (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). For this set of experiments, COS cells were transfected with plasmids expressing BiP along with either a C-terminally HA-tagged form of ERdj3 as a positive control, or with two different Ydj1 constructs engineered with an N-terminal ER signal sequence for targeting to the ER and a C-terminal HA tag for detection. In one construct, the Ydj1 farnesylation site was removed (ssYdj1C406S), and in the other, it was retained (ssYdj1). In yeast, farnesylation enables Ydj1 to associate with the cytosolic surface of the ER and is essential for the function of Ydj1 at elevated temperatures (18.Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Post-transfection, the ER localization of the two Ydj1 isoforms was confirmed using indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2A). Next, the transfected cells were metabolically labeled, treated with a cross-linking agent to stabilize multiprotein complexes, and lysed. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with antiserum against BiP, or a monoclonal antibody against HA, to detect Ydj1. We found that the two Ydj1 isoforms efficiently associated with BiP at levels similar to those observed for ERdj3 (Fig. 2B). Interaction was detected regardless of whether the complex was isolated with anti-BiP or anti-HA antibodies, although the anti-HA antibody was better at detecting this association than the anti-BiP antibody. This is due to the fact that anti-HA immunoprecipitates nearly all of the HA-tagged forms of ERdj3 or Ydj1, whereas the polyclonal anti-BiP isolates only a fraction of BiP (data not shown). Furthermore, when COS cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing Ydj1 and immunoglobulin κ light chain, which is normally a BiP and ERdj3 substrate (32.Shen Y. Hendershot L.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), Ydj1 interacted with κ light chain to the same extent as ERdj3 (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data suggested that Ydj1 attains its native conformation in the mammalian ER and is active. We also found that Ydj1 robustly stimulated the ATP hydrolysis activity of BiP to an even greater degree than ERdj3 (Fig. 2D). Finally, we discovered that purified Ydj1 enhanced the BiP-mediated refolding of denatured firefly luciferase as proficiently as ERdj3 (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, Ydj1 can function as a BiP cofactor when targeted to the mammalian ER. This result was intriguing, because we had previously shown that Ydj1 does not bind to or functionally interact with the yeast ER-lumenal Hsp70, Kar2, in vitro (24.McClellan A.J. Endres J.B. Vogel J.P. Palazzi D. Rose M.D. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3533-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ydj1 was unique in its ability to function in the mammalian ER, we expressed Hlj1, another yeast cytosolic JDP, in COS cells and examined its ability to bind to BiP or a BiP substrate. We found that Hlj1 associated poorly with BiP in these cells and was unable to detect any association with immunoglobulin γ heavy chains (supplemental Fig. S3). These data argue that not all JDPs can serve as a cofactor for BiP in vivo. In yeast, Scj1 and Jem1 are two ER-localized JDPs (28.Nishikawa S. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12889-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38.Schlenstedt G. Harris S. Risse B. Lill R. Silver P.A. J.

Scj1 is a soluble type I JDP (Fig. 1) whose structural organization is similar to ERdj3, although its overall sequence is only 30% identical to that of ERdj3 (supplemental Fig. S1). Jem1 is a membrane-associated type III JDP (Fig. 1), and, owing to its non-canonical domain arrangement, the sequence comparison of Jem1 and ERdj3 was limited to that of the J domains. This analysis revealed that Jem1 and ERdj3 share 35% sequence identity within their J domains (supplemental Fig. S1). Loss of both Scj1 and Jem1 (scj1Δjem1Δ) reduces the degradation efficiency of soluble ERAD substrates (40.Nishikawa S.I. Fewell S.W. Kato Y. Brodsky J.L. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and induces the unfolded protein response (28.Nishikawa S. Endo T. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, the scj1Δjem1Δ strain exhibits a slow growth phenotype at elevated temperatures (28.Nishikawa S. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12889-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because ERdj3 is ER-localized and contains intramolecular disulfide bonds (41.Marcus N.Y. Marcus R.A. Schmidt B.Z. Haslam D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 468: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we initially tested whether this JDP could substitute for Scj1 and Jem1 in the yeast ER. Two ERdj3 constructs were created for strong, constitutive expression from the PGPD promoter (19.Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). One contains an ER-targeting signal sequence (wild-type ERdj3), whereas the other lacks this sequence but possesses a CASQ farnesylation sequence at the C terminus that attaches the protein to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane (CaaX-ERdj3); the farnesylation sequence is the same as that found in Ydj1 (18.Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the constructs were introduced into wild-type SCJ1JEM1 yeast, they did not affect growth, indicating that overexpression of these heterologous proteins is not toxic (Fig. 3A). As expected, when cytosolically targeted CaaX-ERdj3 was overexpressed in the scj1Δjem1Δ strain, it did not restore growth at elevated temperatures, however, neither did ERdj3 (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the lack of an effect on scj1Δjem1Δ growth was due to ineffective Kar2-ERdj3 interaction, we measured the ability of ERdj3 to stimulate the ATPase activity of Kar2. As shown in Fig. 3B, ERdj3 only weakly stimulated the ATP hydrolysis rate of Kar2, as compared with Sec63, a cognate Kar2 JDP that is essential for nascent polypeptide translocation across the ER membrane (27.Corsi A.K.

https://openalex.org/W2032334774,"Therapeutic strategies such as using channel blockers and reducing culture temperature have been used to rescue some long QT-associated voltage-gated potassium Kv trafficking defective mutant channels. A hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated HCN4 pacemaker channel mutant (D553N) has been recently found in a patient associated with cardiac arrhythmias including long QT. D553N showed the defective trafficking to the cell surface, leading to little ionic current expression (loss-of-function). We show in this report that enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src, Fyn, and Yes kinases was able to restore the surface expression of D553N for normal current expression. Src or Yes, but not Fyn, significantly increased the current density and surface expression of D553N. Fyn accelerated the activation kinetics of the rescued D553N. Co-expression of D553N with Yes exhibited the slowest activation kinetics of D553N. Src, Fyn, and Yes significantly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of D553N. A combination of Src, Fyn, and Yes rescued the current expression and the gating of D553N comparable with those of wild-type HCN4. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel mechanism using three endogenous Src kinases to rescue a trafficking defective HCN4 mutant channel (D553N) by enhancing the tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant channel protein."
https://openalex.org/W2005857046,"Designing the shape and size of a cell is an interesting challenge for synthetic biology. Prolonged exposure to the mating pheromone α-factor induces an unusual morphology in yeast cells: multiple mating projections. The goal of this work was to reproduce the multiple projections phenotype in the absence of α-factor using a gain-of-function approach termed “Alternative Inputs (AIs)”. An alternative input is defined as any genetic manipulation that can activate the signaling pathway instead of the natural input. Interestingly, none of the alternative inputs were sufficient to produce multiple projections although some produced a single projection. Then, we extended our search by creating all combinations of alternative inputs and deletions that were summarized in an AIs-Deletions matrix. We found a genetic manipulation (AI-Ste5p ste2Δ) that enhanced the formation of multiple projections. Following up this lead, we demonstrated that AI-Ste4p and AI-Ste5p were sufficient to produce multiple projections when combined. Further, we showed that overexpression of a membrane-targeted form of Ste5p alone could also induce multiple projections. Thus, we successfully re-engineered the multiple projections mating morphology using alternative inputs without α-factor."
