https://openalex.org/W2009312581,"Health information about total populations is a prerequisite for sound decision-making and planning in the health care field. Experience with a population-based health data system in Vermont reveals that there are wide variations in resource input, utilization of services, and expenditures among neighboring communities. Results show prima facie inequalities in the input of resources that are associated with income transfer from areas of lower expenditure to areas of higher expenditure. Variations in utilization indicate that there is considerable uncertainty about the effectiveness of different levels of aggregate, as well as specific kinds of, health services. Informed choices in the public regulation of the health care sector require knowledge of the relation between medical care systems and the population groups being served, and they should take into account the effect of regulation on equality and effectiveness. When population-based data on small areas are available, decisions to expand hospitals, currently based on institutional pressures, can take into account a community's regional ranking in regard to bed input and utilization rates. Proposals by hospitals for unit price increases and the regulation of the actuarial rate of insurance programs can be evaluated in terms of per capita expenditures and income transfer between geographically defined populations. The PSRO's can evaluate the wide variations in level of services among residents of different communities. Coordinated exercise of the authority vested in these regulatory programs may lead to explicit strategies to deal directly with inequality and uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of health care delivery. Population-based health information systems, because they can provide information on the performance of health care systems and regulatory agencies, are an important step in the development of rational public policy for health."

It was found that birth order and family size had independent effects on intellectual performance. Effects of family size were not present in all social classes, but effects of birth order were consistent across social class."
https://openalex.org/W1561728426,"Abstract Homogenates of Tritrichomonas foetus have pyruvate synthase and hydrogenase, but lack pyruvate-formate lyase and formate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate synthase was measured by three anaerobic methods: (a) CO2-pyruvate exchange, which was inhibited by CoA and by several electron acceptors; (b) pyruvate oxidation as measured by the CoA-dependent reduction of methyl viologen, FMN, FAD, riboflavin or clostridial ferredoxin; (c) pyruvate synthesis from acetyl-CoA, CO2, and H2 in the presence of methyl viologen. Hydrogenase as measured by the reduction of methyl viologen, FMN, FAD, riboflavin, or ferredoxin by H2 showed no cofactor requirements. Both enzymes are O2-sensitive and require thiol compounds. As shown by differential sedimentation and isopycnic centrifugation, these activities are in a subcellular particle identified previously as the site of malate and α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenases. Al-though resembling a microbody, this particle lacks catalase and NADH oxidase and is not a peroxisome. It plays a central role in pyruvate degradation, generating electrons leading to molecular hydrogen, by reactions similar to those occurring in clostridia. The term hydrogenosome is suggested to designate this organelle."
https://openalex.org/W2037010168,Exposure of simple cells of the cat striate cortex to high-contrast drifting gratings greatly reduces the subsequent response of the cells to low-contrast gratings. This adaptation effect has an average duration of 30 seconds and shows interocular transfer and selectivity for spatial frequency and orientation. This effect is strikingly similar to the perceptual adaptation to high-contrast gratings.

https://openalex.org/W2042636489,"Rats given intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine after pretreatment with pargyline become aphagic and adipsic, and show severe loss of brain catecholamines. Like rats with lateral hypothalamic lesions, these animals gradually recover ingestive behaviors, although catecholamine depletions are permanent. Both groups decrease food and water intakes markedly after the administration of α-methyltyrosine, at doses that do not affect the ingestive behaviors of control rats. Thus, both the loss and recovery of feeding and drinking behaviors may involve central catecholamine-containing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1552905434,"The three disulfide bridges in epidermal growth factor have been identified by the isolation of three unique cystinyl peptides obtained by thermolytic digestion. The cysteic acid-containing peptide pairs derived from each of the cystinyl peptides were isolated. Their amino acid compositions were in agreement with those predicted from the known amino acid sequence of epidermal growth factor. The cysteinyl residues in positions 6 and 20, 14 and 31, and 33 and 42 were linked as disulfides in this 53 amino acid residue polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2073661241,"Chemical reactions in the aqueous unstirred layers of solution adjacent to a membrane can have dramatic effects on the diffusion of solutes across that membrane. This is demonstrated by the diffusion of labeled salicylate and salicylic acid across a phospholipid bilayer membrane. Two types of chemical reactions are considered. The first is an isotopic exchange reaction between the ionic and nonionic forms of a weak acid, HA + *A(-) [unknown] H*A + A(-). This reaction provides a way of estimating the true membrane permeability to a highly permeant weak acid and also a way of estimating the thickness of the unstirred layers. The second chemical reaction, the dissociation of a weak acid, HA [unknown] H(+) + A(-), can be used to show how the presence or absence of buffers in the unstirred layers controls the net transport of permeant weak acids across a membrane. In principle, the addition of appropriate ""antacid"" buffers to salicylates can increase their rate of absorption from the stomach."
https://openalex.org/W1574263523,"Membranous particulate preparations of hen oviduct and bovine thyroid catalyze the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to endogenous acceptors. One of the mannosylated acceptors is a lipid, which has been partially purified and characterized. Mild acid hydrolysis of labeled mannosyl lipid yields [14C]mannose, whereas alkaline hydrolysis produced [14C]mannose phosphate. The mannosyl lipids formed in both enzyme preparations are chromatographically identical to synthetic mannosyl phosphoryl dolichol. Exogenous dolichol phosphate stimulates the synthesis of mannosyl lipid synthesis in oviduct preparations 7-fold. Synthesis of mannosyl lipid is freely reversible; in the presence of GDP the transfer of mannosyl groups from endogenously labeled mannosyl lipid to GDP-mannose is observed. These results indicate that the mannosyl lipid has the structure of mannosyl phosphoryl polyisoprenol; the precise chain length of the polyisoprenyl moiety remains to be established. A kinetic study of the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to endogenous acceptor in oviduct membranes revealed that, in addition to mannosyl phosphoryl polyisoprenol, two other labeled components are formed. One of these, termed soluble mannosylated endogenous acceptor (mannosyl s-acceptor), has the unique property of being insoluble in chloroform-methanol (2:1) and in water, but is soluble in chloroform-methanol-water (1.0:1.0:0.3). The structure of mannosyl s-acceptor is unknown. The other labeled component, termed residual mannosylated endogenous acceptor (mannosyl r-acceptor), is insoluble in all of the above named solvents. Based on gel filtration and electrophoresis studies performed on mannosyl r-acceptor before and after treatment with proteolytic enzymes it is concluded that this component consists of one or more mannosylated proteins. Several lines of evidence indicate that in oviduct membranes mannosyl phosphoryl polyisoprenol is an obligatory intermediate in the synthesis of mannosyl s-acceptor and the mannosylated protein(s) from GDP-mannose. (a) The formation and turnover of mannosyl phosphoryl polyisoprenol is rapid. Mannosyl s-acceptor is formed more slowly and turns over more slowly. The mannosylated protein(s) is formed even more slowly, and does not turn over. (b) The effect of a chase with unlabeled GDP-mannose on synthesis of labeled mannosyl phosphoryl polyisoprenol, mannosyl s-acceptor and the mannosylated protein(s) was immediate cessation of synthesis of labeled mannosyl phosphoryl polyisoprenol; in contrast, a marked delay was observed in cessation of synthesis of labeled mannosyl s-acceptor and of the mannosylated protein(s). (c) Exogenous, partially purified mannosyl phosphoryl polyisoprenol serves as a mannosyl donor for synthesis of mannosyl s-acceptor and the mannosylated protein(s). Because both the enzymes involved in these reactions and the mannosylated protein(s) produced are associated with membranous components of the cell-free preparations, it is possible that this enzyme system plays an important role in assembly of membrane glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2051441969,Kinetic and metabolic balance studies in a healthy man fed a diet normal in lead content and labeled with lead-204 indicated that approximately two-thirds of his assimilated lead was dietary in origin; the remainder was inhaled. Kinetic analysis shows that the isotopic data can be interpreted by a three-compartment model.
https://openalex.org/W1528157844,"Abstract The dissociation of the extracellular hemoglobin of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris was investigated. At neutral pH, its s°2 0,w = 58.9 ± 0.2 S and D°2 0,w = 1.61 ± 0.05 x 10-7 cm2 s-1 corresponded to a molecular weight of 3.23 ± 0.18 x 106. A minimum molecular weight of 24,000 per heme group was determined from the iron and heme contents, 0.221 ± 0.011 weight % and 2.78 ± 0.14 weight %, respectively. Gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate and acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate showed the presence of two major fragments possessing molecular weights of 52,000 ± 2,000 and 12,000 ± 1,000. The larger of the two subunits dissociated upon sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in mercaptoethanol into three bands corresponding to molecular weights of 14,000 ± 1,000, 16,000 ± 1,000, and 19,000 ± 1,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of Lumbricus hemoglobin in the presence of mercaptoethanol provided a reproducible patterns of six components, four bands with molecular weights of 12,000, 14,000, 16,000, and 19,000, respectively, and two bands with molecular weights of about 31,000 and 36,000. Partial amino acid compositions of the electrophoretically isolated subunits suggested the presence of six different polypeptide chains in earthworm hemoglobin. It is probable that not all of the polypeptide chains in the native molecule are involved in heme binding."
https://openalex.org/W1977605163,"LaCrosse virus (California encephalitis group) was recovered from F(1) eggs, larvae, and adults produced by experimentally infected Aedes triseriatus. The F(1) females transmitted the virus by bite to suckling mice and chipmunks. This, plus isolations of LaCrosse virus from larvae collected from their natural habitats in enzootic areas and from males and females reared from them, suggests that transovarial transmission is the overwintering mechanism for this arbovirus in northern United States."
https://openalex.org/W2057970191,"Selective concentration of [(1)H]progesterone or its metabolites is observed in nuclei of neurons in certain hypothalamic regions of the guinea pig 15 minutes after injection of [1,2,6,7-(3)H]progesterone, by use of dry-mount autoradiography. Highest concentrations of progestin target neurons exist in the nucleus arcuatus, the nucleus preopticus periventricularis, and the nucleus preopticus suprachiasmaticus. Previous administration of unlabeled progesterone inhibits the nuclear concentration of radioactivity, but cortisol has no effect. Estradiol priming enhances the nuclear uptake of radioactivity. The results demonstrate the existence of progestin target sites in the hypothalamus and suggest a direct action of progestin on certain hypothalamic structures."
https://openalex.org/W1992243674,"Polymorphic snails of the genus Cepaea have been widely used for research in ecological genetics. Natural selection by selective predation is important in controlling morph frequencies in some populations of C. nemoralis in England. The importance of environmental selection in affecting other patterns of local genetic differentiation of population structure (area effects) is a matter of controversy. Some authors emphasize divergent evolution of whole gene pools between area effects, while others feel that climatic selection acting on individual loci is important. Analysis of 500,000 C. nemoralis snails from throughout Europe shows that there is a strong positive association between gene frequencies at the shell color locus and mean summer temperature, but that no climatic correlations are obvious at other loci. Another species, C. vindobonensis, which has a much simpler system of polymorphism than does C. nemoralis, was investigated in Yugoslavia, in a region where there is known to be intense microclimatic differentiation because of the accumulation of cold air in frost hollows. There was a striking tendency for snails with lightly pigmented shell bands to be found in places with a warm microclimate. Physiological and behavioral experiments demonstrate that this is due primarily to differential energy absorption from sunshine by the different shell phenotypes. As in C. nemoralis, other C. vindobonensis phenotypes show no detectable association with the environment. It is possible that genes whose frequencies cannot be related to environmental selection may have evolved strong linkage interactions with other genes in the population's gene pool. Selection by the ecological environment and the genetic environment may therefore both be important in controlling the genetic structure of snail populations."
https://openalex.org/W1828343203,"Abstract Bovine adrenal medulla 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine β-hydroxylase has been further characterized. The enzyme consists of four subunits, two pairs of which are linked by disulfide bridges and two pairs of which are held together by noncovalent bonds. Preliminary evidence suggests that these subunits are identical. The activation of this enzyme by anions has been studied. The binding of anions to a basic group adjacent to the ionizable group at the active site has been proposed to explain the mechanism of activation by these compounds. No evidence has been found for an anioninduced conformational change."

Cortical neurons were subsequently highly sensitive to spots of light but not to straight lines, in marked contrast to those from a normal cat. If linear contour processing is an innate function it appears to be subject to substantial modification by early visual experience."
https://openalex.org/W2029692753,"To examine the cellular mechanisms responsible for transition from a short-term to a long-term behavioral modification, a rapid training procedure was developed for producing long-term habituation of the defensive withdrawal of gill and siphon in Aplysia. Four ten-trial training sessions, with 1½-hour intersession intervals, produced habituation that was retained for more than 1 week. This 5-hour procedure could be applied to a test system in the isolated abdominal ganglion where the cellular changes accompanying the acquisition of long-term habituation can be examined. During acquisition, intracellular recordings were obtained from L7, a major gill and siphon motor neuron, and the pattern of stimulation used in the behavioral experiments was applied to an afferent nerve. Acquisition was associated with a progressive decrease in the complex excitatory synaptic potential produced in L7 by afferent nerve stimulation. When retention was tested 24 hours later, the synaptic decrement was still evident. Thus, a behaviorally meaningful stimulus sequence, consisting of only 40 patterned stimuli, leads to changes in synaptic effectiveness lasting one or more days in a neural pathway involved in short-term habituation of this reflex."
https://openalex.org/W2042166542,"Serums from tumor-bearing patients, cured patients, and normal subjects were examined for antibodies to the separated complement-fixing reactive components of nonvirion antigens of herpesvirus type 1 and type 2. The occurrence of antibodies to the antigens was similar in serums from tumor-bearing patients and cured patients. Antibodies to the antigens were observed among 21 of 24 (87 percent) cervical cancer cases, 44 of 49 (90 percent) laryngeal cancer cases, 15 of 24 (62 percent) cases of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck excluding the larynx, 2 of 24 (8 percent) nonsquamous cell cancer cases, and 3 of 51 (6 percent) normal subjects. By contrast, no differences were found in the titers of neutralizing antibodies to the virus in serums from laryngeal cancer patients and controls. The observations support an etiologic role of herpesviruses in cervical cancer and in laryngeal cancer, and possibly other squamous cell cancers of the head and neck."
https://openalex.org/W1583516765,"Abstract Pentapeptides containing either l-serine, l-threonine, l-aspartic acid, l-asparagine, l-glutamic acid, or l-glutamine as central residue in the pattern glycylglycyl-X-glycylglycine have been studied by proton-decoupled natural abundance 13C Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Resonances were assigned by comparison with the free amino acids and by detailed observation of changes in chemical shifts with pH over the range 1.3 to 10.5. The effect of varying the nature of the central residue on the chemical shifts of the flanking glycine residues was established. Each resonance was categorized according to the degree of sensitivity to the state of protonation of the terminal and side chain groups, and the pK values at 26° for those groups were determined from the pH dependence of the most sensitive resonances. The side chain carboxyl group dissociation constants were 3.92 and 4.15 for the aspartic and glutamic acid peptides, respectively. Several resonances showed pH-sensitive broadening phenomena, with splitting detectable in the Cβ of the aspartic acid peptide near the pH corresponding to its pK value. Spin-lattice relaxation times, T1, of protonated carbon nuclei were measured, often at more than one pH value for a given pentapeptide. The pattern of grading of T1 values within each peptide was similar to that observed previously (Keim, P., Vigna, R.A., Marshall, R.C., and Gurd, F. R. N. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6104–6113), except that effects of aggregation were not apparent in the present study. In most cases there appear to be considerable restrictions on the freedom of rotational motion of the β-carbons. Changes in T1 attributable to pH changes were again more marked for resonances most sensitive to amino group protonation than for those most sensitive to carboxyl group protonation."
https://openalex.org/W1997420156,"The effect of treatment with the factor that inhibits the release of melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) identified as 1-prolyl-1-leucylglycinamide (MIF) on brain catecholamine synthesis was examined in normal and hypophysectomized rats. The tripeptide induced a dose-related increase in striatal dopamine synthesis in slices obtained from treated normal animals but not in hypophysectomized animals. Hypothalamic norepinephrine synthesis was unaltered by MIF treatment in normal as well as in hypophysectomized rats. In addition, dopamine and norepinephrine syntheses were depressed in untreated hypophysectomized animals, as compared to normal controls. These results constitute the first direct demonstration of a central neurochemical effect of a hypothalamic factor."
https://openalex.org/W1674048610,"Abstract Intraperitoneal administration of aromatic hydrocarbons such as β-naphthoflavone or 3-methylcholanthrene stimulates hydroxylation activity toward carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene in the C57BL/6J inbred mouse strain, but this effect is virtually absent in the DBA/2J inbred mouse strain. Aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene) hydroxylase activity was examined in vitro with various combinations of the solubilized NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, phospholipid, and cytochrome P448 or P450 fractions obtained from liver microsomes of β-naphthoflavone-treated mice of both strains. The results obtained indicate that the genetic difference in the inducible hydroxylase activity resides entirely in the fraction containing cytochromes P448 and P450. With respect to the reconstitution of d-benzphetamine N-demethylase and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities in vitro, each of these solubilized reductase, lipid, and cytochrome fractions—alone or in combination—from mouse liver can be interchanged successfully with those from rat liver, indicating a lack of species specificity in the hepatic monooxygenase system between mouse and rat."
https://openalex.org/W1985539134,"Prolonged alcohol consumption (5 months) concomitant with adequate nutrition was found to impair the acquisition and performance of timing behavior. Alcohol was administered in the form of a liquid diet containing 35 percent ethanol-derived calories as the only source of fluid and calories. One control group received the identical liquid diet with isocaloric substitution of sucrose for ethanol, and another control group received laboratory chow and water without restriction. Thirty days after ethanol was discontinued in the diet, the alcohol-consuming rats were severely impaired in acquisition and performance of timing behavior as compared to controls."
https://openalex.org/W1583794750,"Abstract The guanylation of tRNA in a cell-free system has been achieved in a lysate of rabbit reticulocytes. The enzymatic nature of the reaction is indicated by sensitivity to trypsin, heat inactivation, and by the precipitation of the guanylating activity with ammonium sulfate. The lysate did not incorporate guanine after endogenous tRNA was removed by RNase, or by binding the tRNA to an anion exchange resin. Guanylating activity was restored only by adding back reticulocyte or yeast tRNA. Liver tRNA or the synthetic homopolymers poly(A), poly(U), poly(C), or poly(G) did not serve as substrates. The reaction requires a monovalent cation which is best met by Li+ or K+ and the Km for guanine is 2.5 x 10-5 m. The guanylated tRNA appears to be identical with that produced in vivo since the guanine residue is incorporated into an internal position in the polynucleotide chain and the guanylated tRNA co-chromatographs with the minor reticulocyte tRNAhis on a reversed phase column. When uniformly labeled guanosine is the substrate the purine ring but not the ribose moiety is incorporated into tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1989477163,"Crystal structures of N(6),N(9)-dimethyladenine and N(6)-methyladenine hydrochloride were determined from three-dimensional x-ray diffraction data. The bases assume a conformation in which the N(6)-methyl group blocks one of the hydrogen-bonding sites normally used by adenine to form Watson-Crick pairs with thymine in double-helical DNA. When in this conformation, N(6)-methyladenine residues might alter the secondary structure of DNA. thereby preventing the scission of modified DNA's by restriction enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1569111864,"Abstract Nucleophiles, including dihydroflavins, dithiols, dihydrofolate, tetrahydrofolate, and dehydroascorbate, were found to promote the geometrical isomerization of all-trans-retinal to 9-cis-retinal and 13-cis-retinal. No trace of the 11-cis or 9,13-di-cis isomers could be detected among the products. If isomerization of all-trans-retinal occurred in the presence of bleached particulate rhodopsin, the photosensitive pigment isorhodopsin was produced. No tritium was incorporated into all-trans-, 9-cis-, or 13-cis-retinal when the isomerization reaction was carried out with stannous chloride and FMN in tritiated water. Dihydroflavins, the most active agents for the production of 9-cis-retinal, functioned catalytically and were effective at concentrations as low as 1 µm. They did not catalyze the isomerization of all-trans-retinol. In the absence of catalyst, all-trans-retinal and all-trans-retinol were both resistant to thermal isomerization in the physiological range of pH and temperature. The capacity of photoreceptor membrane preparations to promote the isomerization of all-trans-retinal to 9-cis-retinal, when they were incubated anaerobically in the presence of stannous chloride, suggests that they contain reducible endogenous flavin. The recombination of chromophore molecule with apoprotein in bleached photoreceptor membrane preparations was largely completed within about 1 min and proceeded about 20 times faster than the rate of isomerization of all-trans-retinal to 9-cis-retinal in the presence of 0.1 mm dihydro-FMN and about 80 times faster than the isomerization facilitated by the endogenous catalyst. A convenient method has been devised for the preparation of dihydroriboflavin."
https://openalex.org/W14754943,"Abstract An in vitro study of the conversion of procollagen to collagen was carried out by culturing embryonic chicken calvaria and labeling them with [3,4-3H]proline and [35S]cysteine. A pulse experiment in the presence of α,α'-dipyridyl, an iron chelator, was used to accumulate procollagen in the tissue. The presence of procollagen was demonstrated by the incorporation of [35S]cysteine and by its chromatographic behavior on CM-cellulose under denaturing conditions. Using a parallel sample for a subsequent chase experiment in the absence of α,α'-dipyridyl, only traces of procollagen were found in the tissue, since [35S]cysteine had disappeared and radioactive material chromatographed with the authentic α chains of lathyritic rat skin collagen. It is proposed that the conversion of procollagen to collagen is paralleled by the release of procollagen peptides into the culture medium, indicating a single step enzymatic cleavage. These peptides were isolated from the culture medium, and their molecular weights were determined as 18,000 for a [35S]cysteine-containing and 12,000 for a [35S]cysteine-free peptide. Both values are within the size range expected for peptides cleaved from procollagen chains of molecular weights between 110,000 and 120,000."

https://openalex.org/W1989499861,"The crystal and molecular structure of the naturally occurring deoxyribose dinucleotide sodium thymidylyl-(5'-->3')-thymidylate-5' has been determined by x-ray diffraction. There are four molecules of dinucleotide and 52 water molecules in an orthorhombic unit cell of dimensions (in angstroms) a = 16.06, b = 15.13, c = 15.65, space group P2(1)2(1)2. There is a very high degree of conformational consistency between the two halves of the molecule when the dinucleotide is viewed as the combination of two 5'-mononucleotides. The planes of the two thymines are not parallel, but are tilted 38 degrees with respect to each other. An extensive system of hydrogen bonding exists involving the bases, waters, phosphates, and sodiums; no base-base hydrogen bonding occurs. The dinucleotide structural parameters should be of assistance in interpreting DNA fiber diagrams in terms of possible structures."

https://openalex.org/W1651341881,"Abstract Preincubation of a 10,000 x g supernatant from rat liver for 20 min at 37° increased the subsequent incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol by 8- to 20-fold. Cholesterol synthesis from [14C]citrate was comparably activated. Optimal activation occurred at 0.6 to 1.2 mm magnesium; no activation was observed at 6.0 mm Mg2+. The activated rate of cholesterol synthesis from acetate (10 to 25 nmoles per g wet weight per hour) was higher than that previously reported for rat liver homogenates. Optimal activation of cholesterol biosynthesis from [14C]-acetate was also obtained when isolated microsomes and cytosol were preincubated and assayed together. Much lower activation was seen when these fractions were preincubated separately and recombined for assay. Activation of cholesterol biosynthesis was not seen with [14C]mevalonate as substrate. Conversion of [14C]acetate to both fatty acids and CO2 was tripled by preincubation, while conversion to acetoacetate was unaffected. The data suggest that this activation is specific for those enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis which convert acetyl-CoA to mevalonate and may reflect the reversal in vitro of a physiological control on cholesterol biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1584804523,"Abstract The sesquiterpenoid antibiotics, trichodermin and T-2 toxin, are inhibitors of polyphenylalanine biosynthesis and peptide chain termination in vitro with rabbit reticulocyte extracts. The formation of fMet-puromycin from fMet-tRNA· AUG·ribosome complexes, an activity associated with the 60 S ribosomal peptidyltransferase, is inhibited effectively by these antibiotics. Release factor (RF)-dependent release of formylmethionine from these ribosomal complexes is also prevented under conditions where GTP and codon recognition are not required. Both the RF-dependent hydrolysis of ribosome-bound fMet-tRNA and the synthesis of fMet-puromycin require an active peptidyltransferase and it appears likely, therefore, that trichodermin and T-2 toxin affect this ribosomal activity involved in protein biosynthesis. A number of other partial reactions examining intermediate steps of peptide chain elongation and termination are not affected by these antibiotics."

After the administration of tritiated amino acids, animals raised on a fat-free ration show no evidence of disc formation, while those raised on a normnal ration show disc formation and renewal. The latter process is apparently dependent upon the availability of linoleic or linolenic (or both) fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W59639971,"A multistate, cooperative program seeking to develop better methods for the effective and efficient gathering. storing, analyzing, and utilizing of mental patient records has made a comprehensive effort to protect the confidentiality and privacy of these psychiatric patient records. Administrative, technical, and legal safeguards have been implemented. The discussion of legal safeguards involves two areas: the protection of the system itself, located at Rockland State Hospital; and the specific legal environment of confidentiality and privacy of mental health records and information in the group of cooperating jurisdictions. On the whole, adequate legal and administrative protection can be afforded the confidentiality and privacy of an electronic data system in the mental health field, and access to the records can be restricted for the welfare of the patients. At the same time, access to aggregate data in the system can be allowed, under proper standards, for important research and planning purposes. The methods adopted by MSIS to preserve confidentiality and privacy by limiting access to such records could well prove an important model for the development of protective methods in other electronic data programs-not only those in psychiatry, but those in other fields where the data collected are sensitive and confidential."

As purified from jack bean meal, urease is obtained in the α form (Mr = 480,000, s20,w = 18.3), which is composed of two noncovalently bound, equal and active A1 half-units (Mr = 240,000, s20,w = 11.5) which separate after treatment with glycol (and similar solvents) and are stable in neutral aqueous solution at low ionic strength. Upon removing thiol, α aggregates to an integral arithmetic, disulfide-bonded polymer series in a reaction that is fully reversed by addition of thiol. Treatment of the polymer series with 40 to 50% glycol produced an intermediate series of hemipolymers whose Mr values differed from those of the corresponding polymers by an A1 unit. Polymer and hemipolymer members have been isolated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, were equiactive, and remained unchanged in form, purity, and activity for several days. Concentration dependence was not evident for any of the six isozymes for which multiple sedimentation coefficients were obtained. The hydrodynamic data were analyzed by the Kirkwood equation, Perrin's formula, and Stokes law. The analysis had indicated that the polymers were composed of a linear singlet chain of spherical α units. Taking A1 as the polymerizing unit, the Kirkwood equation best described the polymers and hemipolymers as a linear doublet chain of A1 monomers. It is concluded that the analysis is self-consistent and that urease polymerizes in a linear, disulfide-bonded condensation reaction. In addition, the evidence suggests that the isolated A1 isozyme is also nearly spherical and undergoes conformational change upon dimerizing to the spherical α-urease."
https://openalex.org/W1524919094,"Abstract The phosphorylation of specific non-histone proteins in isolated rat liver nuclei is modified by the addition of exogenous histone fractions. The added histones are quantitatively adsorbed and their presence in the chromatin has been verified by electron microscope autoradiography. Histone fractions F1 and F2A1 stimulate phosphorylation of different nuclear phosphoproteins. F1 stimulates the phosphorylation of a protein fraction with a molecular weight of about 40,000, while F2A1 enhances phosphorylation of a protein fraction with a molecular weight of about 22,000. F1 and F2A1 each inhibit the phosphorylation of a specific low molecular weight nuclear protein fraction. Histones F2A2, F2B and F3 have little effect on the phosphorylation of non-histone proteins under these conditions. The results suggest that individual histones may be involved in the control of phosphorylation of specific non-histone nuclear proteins, particularly at times when the concentrations of nuclear proteins are changing relative to one another."
https://openalex.org/W2059500699,"Thymocytes from mice carrying Moloney murine leukemia virus since birth are cytotoxic for normal syngeneic fibroblasts; they are much less cytotoxic for the same cells infected with this virus. The cytotoxic thymocytes appear to increase in number with age of the carrier mice and are present both during preleukemic and leukemic periods. These results suggest that lymphomas in carrier mice result from a sequence of events initiated by intrathymic destruction of normal cells by virus-infected cells, and culminating in the unrestricted proliferation of autoaggressive clones in the thymic cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1559063385,"Isolated adipose tissue cells were prelabeled by incubation with radioactive fatty acids or radioglucose and subsequently transferred to a medium containing serum albumin and epinephrine. The specific activity of the fatty acids released during the first 15 min exceeded that of the bulk glycerides by a factor of over 10, and then dropped rapidly. Cellular free fatty acids could be excluded as the source of these high activity fatty acids. The specific activity of the diglyceride fraction in the prelabeled cells was 3 times that of the fatty acid released and dropped considerably during incubation with epinephrine. The absolute amount of diglyceride did not decrease. Diglycerides accounted for part of the fatty acids released. The rest was derived from a pool of triglycerides of high specific activity, which replenished the diglyceride pool and equilibrated with the bulk triglycerides in 1 hour. Equilibration of the triglyceride pools was very slow in the absence of epinephrine."
https://openalex.org/W1588117711,"Abstract Chromatography over columns of CM-cellulose and Amberlite IRC-50 was used to fractionate the ribonucleases present in the pancreatic secretion of sheep. The chromatographic behavior of these enzymes was similar to that of the enzymes found in bovine pancreatic secretion, as was also their relative distribution. The principal component, ribonuclease A, accounted for ∼85% of the ribonuclease in the secretion. The remainder was present as several minor components, designated ribonucleases B, C, and D. Ribonucleases A, B, and C were isolated in a chromatographically homogeneous condition. Ribonuclease D, which may be a mixture of several components, was not studied further. Ribonucleases A, B, and C possessed the same amino acid composition, which differs by 8 residues from the composition of bovine ribonuclease A. Ovine ribonuclease B and C were found to be glycoproteins; ovine ribonuclease A was devoid of carbohydrate. Ribonuclease B contained ∼2 residues of N-acetylglucosamine and ∼6 of mannose. Ribonuclease C contained ∼5 residues of N-acetylglucosamine, ∼6 of mannose, ∼2 of galactose, ∼2 of fucose, and no sialic acid. Glycopeptides derived from residues 34 through 39 in the amino acid sequence of ovine ribonuclease (see Kobayashi, R., and Hirs, C.H.W. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 7833–7837) were isolated from tryptic hydrolysates of reduced, S-aminoethylated ribonuclease B and C. These glycopeptides have the NH2-terminal sequence Asn-Leu-Thr, a sequence homologous with the sequence in bovine ribonuclease B at which there is a site of carbohydrate-peptide attachment."
https://openalex.org/W1507164019,"Abstract In intact rat liver mitochondria, pyruvate carboxylase activity and the previously described inhibition of pyruvate carboxylation by low concentrations of calcium (Kimmich, G. A., and Rasmussen, H. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 190) were shown to be dependent on the sucrose concentration in the incubation medium. Pyruvate carboxylation was maximal at sucrose concentrations below 60 mm and was progressively inhibited at higher sucrose concentrations. Pyruvate oxidation was inhibited by sucrose to about the same extent as pyruvate carboxylation. At low sucrose concentrations, 100 µm calcium was found to have little influence on pyruvate carboxylation (l10%). When the enzymatic activity was depressed by sucrose, a relative inhibition of up to 74% was produced by calcium. However, the absolute decrease of pyruvate carboxylase activity in the presence of calcium never exceeded 15% of the enzyme activity measured under optimal conditions. In mitochondria preloaded with calcium, pyruvate carboxylation was strongly depressed. The content of several intramitochondrial components had changed during preloading and the enzyme activity appeared to be mainly regulated by the intramitochondrial ATP:ADP ratio."

Data from synchronous cultures of Chlorella pyrenoidosa have been analyzed by this method by means of a readily available computer program. The method can be used with any biological system that generates normal sigmoidal data.
https://openalex.org/W1548953087,"Abstract A new catabolite with a two-carbon shorter side chain and a trans-ureido ring, d-allobisnorbiotin, has been isolated from the culture filtrates of a pseudomonad grown on double-labeled d-biotin. Most of the original ureido carbonyl 14C of biotin has been lost but 3H in the thiolane ring and the side chain portion is retained in the catabolite. Maximal amounts of d-allobisnorbiotin are formed under conditions for bacterial growth where aeration is limited. Formation of this catabolite must occur from the level of bisnorbiotin by way of cleavage of the cis-ureido ring at the bridgehead carbon opposite the side chain, followed by decarbamylation and recarbamylation to form the trans isomer."
https://openalex.org/W1569005700,"Abstract Heat is evolved when solutions of trypsinogen or chymotrypsinogen A are mixed with solutions of the amide or methyl ester derivatives of Nα-p-toluenesulfonyl-l-arginine, appropriate corrections being made for heats of reactant dilution. Exothermic reaction was also observed when the two ligands were mixed with α-chymotrypsin; all measurements were made at 25°, pH 5.0. The dependence of apparent reaction heat upon ligand concentration was used to evaluate ligand binding site models, thereby providing values for changes in free energy and entropy as well. Binding to the zymogens was represented by a model having a single class of sites, but description of the ester-α-chymotrypsin data required the postulation of two classes of ligand binding sites. Comparison with previous kinetic investigations leads to the view that the ligand binding site of the zymogen persists in the active enzyme, in addition to the binding site made available upon activation of the zymogen by trypsin."

Myoglobin and bicarbonate are suggested as energy carriers in muscle, having the combined capacity for conveying all waste metabolic heat produced under normal physiological conditions. The concept is extended to convective heat transfer in vivo; this implicates hemoglobin."
