https://openalex.org/W2089843538,"Majorana fermions are predicted to localize at the edge of a topological superconductor, a state of matter that can form when a ferromagnetic system is placed in proximity to a conventional superconductor with strong spin-orbit interaction. With the goal of realizing a one-dimensional topological superconductor, we have fabricated ferromagnetic iron (Fe) atomic chains on the surface of superconducting lead (Pb). Using high-resolution spectroscopic imaging techniques, we show that the onset of superconductivity, which gaps the electronic density of states in the bulk of the Fe chains, is accompanied by the appearance of zero-energy end-states. This spatially resolved signature provides strong evidence, corroborated by other observations, for the formation of a topological phase and edge-bound Majorana fermions in our atomic chains."

Global maps constructed using satellite-derived gravity data, in contrast, are limited in the size of features they can resolve.

They identify several previously unknown tectonic features, including extinct spreading ridges in the Gulf of Mexico and numerous uncharted seamounts. Science , this issue p. 65 ; see also p. 32"
https://openalex.org/W2038462691,"In 2010, the international community, under the auspices of the Convention on Biological Diversity, agreed on 20 biodiversity-related ""Aichi Targets"" to be achieved within a decade. We provide a comprehensive mid-term assessment of progress toward these global targets using 55 indicator data sets. We projected indicator trends to 2020 using an adaptive statistical framework that incorporated the specific properties of individual time series. On current trajectories, results suggest that despite accelerating policy and management responses to the biodiversity crisis, the impacts of these efforts are unlikely to be reflected in improved trends in the state of biodiversity by 2020. We highlight areas of societal endeavor requiring additional efforts to achieve the Aichi Targets, and provide a baseline against which to assess future progress."

Savitski et al. take significant steps toward meeting this daunting challenge. They monitored the unfolding or “melting” of over 7000 human proteins and measured how small-molecule binding changes individual melting profiles. As a proof of principle, over 50 targets were identified for an inhibitor known to bind a broad spectrum of kinases. Two cancer drugs, vemurafib and Alectinib, are known to have a side effect of photosensitivity. The thermal profiling approach identified drug-protein interactions responsible for these side effects.

Normally this protein helps attach a biochemical tag to cellular proteins that marks them for degradation. The new work shows that the tumor-associated mutant protein loses this tagging ability, which results in the stabilization of a handful of cellular proteins that would otherwise be degraded.

https://openalex.org/W2038316782,"Increasing evidence indicates cancer-related inflammatory biomarkers show great promise for predicting the outcome of cancer patients. The lymphocyte- monocyte ratio (LMR) was demonstrated to be independent prognostic factor mainly in hematologic tumor. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of LMR in operable lung cancer. We retrospectively enrolled a large cohort of patients with primary lung cancer who underwent complete resection at our institution from 2006 to 2011. Inflammatory biomarkers including lymphocyte count and monocyte count were collected from routinely performed preoperative blood tests and the LMR was calculated. Survival analyses were calculated for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). A total of 1453 patients were enrolled in the study. The LMR was significantly associated with OS and DFS in multivariate analyses of the whole cohort (HR = 1.522, 95% CI: 1.275-1.816 for OS, and HR = 1.338, 95% CI: 1.152-1.556 for DFS). Univariate subgroup analyses disclosed that the prognostic value was limited to patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (HR: 1.824, 95% CI: 1.520-2.190), in contrast to patients with small cell lung cancer (HR: 1.718, 95% CI: 0.946-3.122). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that LMR was still an independent prognostic factor in NSCLC. LMR can be considered as a useful independent prognostic marker in patients with NSCLC after complete resection. This will provide a reliable and convenient biomarker to stratify high risk of death in patients with operable NSCLC."

Reversible coupling of excitons and photons enabled groundbreaking results in condensation and superfluidity of nonequilibrium quasiparticles with a photonic component. We investigated such cavity-polaritons in the presence of a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, exhibiting strongly correlated phases. When the cavity was on resonance with the Fermi level, we observed previously unknown many-body physics associated with a dynamical hole-scattering potential. In finite magnetic fields, polaritons show distinct signatures of integer and fractional quantum Hall ground states. Our results lay the groundwork for probing nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum Hall states and exploiting the electron density dependence of polariton splitting so as to obtain ultrastrong optical nonlinearities."

The expression of various neuronal immediate early genes (IEGs)—genes that are primarily induced by neuronal activity—such as c-Fos, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc, also known as Arg3.1) is predominantly CREB dependent (Bito et al., 1997Bito H.

In spite of this significance, our current understanding about the mechanisms by which the promoters and enhancers of such IEGs are robustly stimulated by neuronal activity through convergent effects of different sets of transcription factors and associated coactivators remains limited. Furthermore, we lack insights on how differential coordination of transcription may regulate engrams in distinct brain areas and cooperatively produce a long-term modification of cognitive performance (Lonze and Ginty, 2002Lonze B.E.

It has been suggested that IEG expression profiles during basal and activated states may differ among brain regions, and such data were considered as functional evidence in support for an uneven contribution of distinct brain regions during cognitive behavior (Frankland et al., 2004Frankland P.W.

In keeping with this, recent work has indicated differential CREB phosphorylation profiles and time courses in different brain regions during reconsolidation and extinction of fear memory (Cowansage et al., 2013Cowansage K.K. Bush D.E. Josselyn S.A. Klann E. Ledoux J.E. Basal variability in CREB phosphorylation predicts trait-like differences in amygdala-dependent memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Brain region-specific gene expression activation required for reconsolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, it remains unsolved whether the distinctive neuronal activities in those brain areas are the sole determinants of such differential activity-regulated transcription. An alternative hypothesis that has not been tested so far is the possibility that cellular consolidation of memory-related events might employ distinct CREB complexes in different brain areas to convert incoming synaptic inputs to long-term events. CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator (CRTC), also known as transducer of regulated CREB activity (TORC), has recently emerged as a unique CREB coactivator that binds to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) region of CREB (Conkright et al., 2003Conkright M.D. Canettieri G. Screaton R. Guzman E. Miraglia L. Hogenesch J.B. Montminy M. TORCs: transducers of regulated CREB activity.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 413-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). CRTCs are Ser/Thr-rich proteins (Ser/Thr composition = 18.3%–21.1%) with multiple phosphorylation and glycosylation sites. Among the known isoforms of CRTC (CRTC1, 2, and 3), CRTC2 has been best explored. In CRTC2, the covalent modification of Ser171, by alternative phosphorylation/glycosylation, determines its subcellular localization: nuclear in the glycosylated or virgin state, and cytoplasmic in the phosphorylated states. CRTC2 plays key roles in gluconeogenesis, insulin signaling, and cell proliferation in the liver and pancreas (Altarejos and Montminy, 2011Altarejos J.Y. Montminy M. CREB and the CRTC co-activators: sensors for hormonal and metabolic signals.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), whereas CRTC3 contributes to the development of obesity by attenuating β-adrenergic receptor signaling in adipose tissue (Song et al., 2010Song Y. Altarejos J. Goodarzi M.O. Inoue H. Guo X. Berdeaux R. Kim J.H. Goode J. Igata M. Paz J.C. et al.CHARGE ConsortiumGIANT ConsortiumCRTC3 links catecholamine signalling to energy balance.Nature. 2010; 468: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). CRTC1-null mice also develop obesity as a result of dysregulation of the hypothalamic feeding center (Altarejos et al., 2008Altarejos J.Y. Goebel N. Conkright M.D. Inoue H. Xie J. Arias C.M. Sawchenko P.E. Montminy M. The Creb1 coactivator Crtc1 is required for energy balance and fertility.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Consistently, in Caenorhabditis elegans, where only one copy of CRTC gene exists, CRTC1-dependent transcription via CREB is critical for the control of energy homeostasis and longevity (Mair et al., 2011Mair W. Morantte I. Rodrigues A.P. Manning G. Montminy M. Shaw R.J. Dillin A. Lifespan extension induced by AMPK and calcineurin is mediated by CRTC-1 and CREB.Nature. 2011; 470: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CRTC1, an isoform that is most abundantly expressed in the central nervous system (Watts et al., 2011Watts A.G. Sanchez-Watts G. Liu Y. Aguilera G. The distribution of messenger RNAs encoding the three isoforms of the transducer of regulated cAMP responsive element binding protein activity in the rat forebrain.J.

Despite the critical importance of nuclear CREB-regulated transcription in cognition, the mechanisms underlying the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of CRTC1, and CRTC1’s impact on memory-related processes, have remained elusive. In order to address these questions, we here identified key amino acid residues underlying nuclear shuttling of neuronal CRTC1 via pharmacological and mass spectrometric analyses. Quantitative understanding of CRTC1’s phosphorylation states enabled rational designing of a constitutively active mutant form of CRTC1 (caCRTC1) whose localization was restricted to the nucleus of neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed an activity-dependent association of CRTC1 with CREB-regulated elements on active IEG promoters. Taking advantage of caCRTC1, we then found that the nuclear accumulation of CRTC1 was sufficient to markedly stimulate neuronal CREB-dependent gene expression even in the absence of evoked synaptic activity in vitro or in naive mice in vivo. Mice virally expressing caCRTC1 in the dorsal hippocampus showed enhancement of long-term contextual fear memory, which was accompanied by enlargement of dendritic spines. Surprisingly, during contextual fear conditioning (CFC), nuclear recruitment of endogenous CRTC1 was detected in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but not in the hippocampus. In keeping with this, CRTC1 knockdown in the amygdala, but not in the hippocampus, significantly attenuated fear memory. Taken together, our study provides evidence for a wide impact of CRTC1 on nuclear CREB-mediated memory processes, and also indicates that the phosphorylation states critical for activity-dependent nuclear translocation of CRTC1 are controlled in a region-specific manner that is distinct from the regulation of CREB phosphorylation. Thus, CRTC1 may act as a localized, rather than global, tunable switching mechanism for specifying CREB output and activity-dependent transcription, contributing to optimizing the formation and allocation of memory across brain regions. CRTC1 is a Ser/Thr-rich protein (Ser/Thr content = 21.1%). To enable high coverage identification for critical phosphorylated residues, we performed mass spectrometric analysis of CRTC1 immunoprecipitated from cultured cortical neurons, and identified 11 Ser or Thr phosphorylation sites (Figure 1 A). To investigate activity-dependent regulation of these candidate phosphorylation sites, we established a translocation assay in primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons. The neurons were initially silenced with 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) in order to restrict CRTC1 in the cytoplasm and then synaptically activated by washing out TTX and adding a BIC/4AP cocktail (30 μM bicuculline, 100 μM 4-aminopyridine, 100 μM glycine, and 1 μM strychnine) to induce nuclear translocation of CRTC1 (Figure 1B). The neurons were fixed after various incubation times, and CRTC1 immunoreactivity (IR) was measured in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Figures 1C and 1D). The activity-dependent nuclear translocation of CRTC1 was rapid, achieving a peak and plateau within 2 min after stimulus onset (Figure 1C). Once the culture medium was returned to the TTX-containing solution, CRTC1 was exported from the nucleus within 30 min (Figure 1D). The distribution and redistribution of CRTC1 may thus serve as a dynamic trace that integrates the incoming synaptic activity of the immediate past. Diverse kinase and phosphatase pathways have previously been implicated in regulation of the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of CRTC1–3 (Koo et al., 2005Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F.

We therefore examined the kinases that controlled the phosphorylation states of neuronal CRTC1. Phenformin, a potent activator of many kinases including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), prevented the occurrence of both the activity-dependent nuclear translocation of CRTC1 (Figure S1A available online) and BIC/4AP-induced CRE-dependent transcription activity (Figure 1E). Conversely, compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK and salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2), promoted the nuclear translocation of CRTC1 in the presence of spontaneous activity (Figure S1B), as well as increased the extent of synaptically induced CRE-dependent promoter activity (Figure 1F). Consistent with these results, additional experiments showed that kinases that have been suggested to function upstream of SIK2, including protein kinase A (PKA) (Figure S1C) as well as a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK)-CaMKI/IV cascade (Figure S1D), contributed to the regulation of the nuclear translocation of CRTC1. Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active or dominant-negative forms of microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2) shifted CRTC1 localization to the cytoplasm or nucleus, respectively (Figure 1G), implicating MARK2 as an independent upstream regulator of neuronal CRTC1. In contrast, we found that a cocktail consisting of inhibitors of a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CsA/FK, cyclosporin A and FK506) attenuated the activity-dependent nuclear translocation of CRTC1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1H), while also inhibiting activity-induced CRE-dependent promoter activity (Figure 1F). Together, these findings indicated that in synaptically connected hippocampal neurons, the basal constitutive phosphorylation states of CRTC1 were largely under the control of SIK2/AMPK and MARK2. In combination, these constitutive kinases gated the onset of CRTC1 nuclear translocation, which was then turned on by an activity-dependent calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation to facilitate CRE-dependent gene expression. We next turned to cultured cortical neurons to determine the key phosphorylation sites underlying CRTC1’s nuclear shuttling. We found marked changes in the electrophoretic mobility of CRTC1 associated with its phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. The abundance of the lowest-mobility (upper) bands were increased on exposure of neurons to phenformin or to CsA/FK, whereas synaptic stimulation of neurons or in vitro treatment of cell lysates with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) increased the intensity of the highest-mobility (lower) band (Figure 2 A). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis based on the mass spectrometry data (Figure 1A) revealed that S151A and S245A were mutations that attenuated the phosphorylation-related mobility shift of FLAG epitope-tagged CRTC1 (Figures 2B, S2A, and S2B). Consistent with this, increased synaptic activity triggered dephosphorylation of these Ser residues in neurons (Figures S2C and S2D). Interestingly, the combined double mutant (S151A/S245A) lost any activity-dependent mobility shift (“ca” in Figure 2C). These results suggest that Ser151 and Ser245 might regulate the surface charges and conformation of CRTC1. This was consistent with a prior report of Ser151 phosphorylation by SIK2/AMPK (Sasaki et al., 2011Sasaki T. Takemori H. Yagita Y. Terasaki Y. Uebi T. Horike N. Takagi H. Susumu T. Teraoka H. Kusano K. et al.SIK2 is a key regulator for neuronal survival after ischemia via TORC1-CREB.Neuron. 2011; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but further highlighted the critical importance of Ser245 phosphorylation, likely by MARK2, in cytoplasmic retention of CRTC1 in neurons. Taken together, the basal phosphorylation by a constitutive kinase, MARK2, and by SIK/AMPK, appeared to critically regulate the calcineurin-triggered nucleocytoplasmic CRTC1 shuttling. We next examined the functional relevance of these two phosphorylation/dephosphorylation sites, Ser151 and Ser245, on CREB-dependent transcription. The CRTC1 double mutant (S151A/S245A or caCRTC1) localized almost exclusively to the nucleus even in the presence of TTX (Figure 3 A), although mutation of either site alone was not sufficient to induce such a degree of nuclear translocation (Figure S3A; data not shown). A sizable portion of the CRTC1 mutant (S151A/S245A) remained in the nucleus when stimulated in the presence of CsA/FK, indicating that dual-alanine mutation of Ser151 and Ser245 conferred resistance to calcineurin inhibitors (Figure 3B). A constitutively cytosolic mutant (mutCN) was generated by introducing mutations in two consensus calcineurin-binding motifs (PxIxIT) of CRTC1 (Screaton et al., 2004Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G. Jeffries S. Guzman E. Niessen S. Yates III, J.R. Takemori H. et al.The CREB coactivator TORC2 functions as a calcium- and cAMP-sensitive coincidence detector.Cell. 2004; 119: 61-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). The activities of both of these mutant proteins in neurons were quantified by CRE-reporter assays (Figure 3C). First, knockdown of CRTC1 with two independent short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (shCRTC1-#1 and shCRTC1-#2) showed that CRTC1 is critical for activity-regulated CRE-dependent transcription (Figure 3C). Expression of an shRNA-resistant form of wild-type CRTC1 (WT-CRTC1res) restored the transcription activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures S3C–S3E). However, expression of S151A/S245A (caCRTC1res) in this context conferred a high level of CRE-dependent transcription even in CRTC1-depleted neurons exposed to TTX, and this effect was increased further in the presence of BIC/4AP (Figure 3C). The latter effect of BIC/4AP was blocked by CsA/FK, implying an additional calcineurin-sensitive mechanism to further facilitate CRE-dependent transcription. In contrast, CRTC1 (mutCNres) did not evoke transcriptional activity in CRTC1-depleted neurons exposed to either TTX or BIC/4AP (Figure 3C). Together, in contrast to previous studies emphasizing the role of Ser151, our results revealed a critical role for both Ser151 and Ser245. Given the ability of S151A/S245A mutant of CRTC1 to confer CRE-dependent promoter activity in neurons even in the presence of TTX, we hereafter refer to this mutant as caCRTC1. Expression of caCRTC1 did not increase the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 in neurons exposed to either TTX or BIC/4AP (data not shown), suggesting that the nuclear accumulation of CRTC1 in the absence of CREB phosphorylation is sufficient to induce CRE-dependent transcription. To examine this notion further in an acute system, we constructed caCRTC1-ERT2 by fusing caCRTC1 to a mutant form of the estrogen receptor (ER) that is receptive exclusively to a synthetic ligand of ER (Figure 3D). caCRTC1-ERT2 successfully translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (Figure 3E). Exposure of the transfected cells to 4-OHT in TTX-containing medium for 4 hr resulted in a marked increase in CRE-dependent transcription in neurons (Figure 3F). This activity was further increased when BIC/4AP was applied with 4-OHT (Figure S3F), suggesting that there is a combinatorial regulation of nuclear CRTC1 and other CRTC1-independent CREB regulatory components downstream of synaptic activity (see also Figure 3C). Notably, the 4-OHT-induced acute caCRTC1-ERT2 nuclear accumulation was not accompanied by detectable increase in the level of phosphorylated CREB (Figure 3G). We further found that c-Fos is induced in this condition in the absence of synaptic activity (Figure S3G). Together, these results supported the notion that the nuclear translocation of CRTC1 was sufficient to induce CRE-dependent transcription in neurons, and also that nuclear CRTC1 might synergize with other synaptic activity-driven CREB signaling cascades to facilitate CRE-dependent transcription. To determine the role of nuclear CRTC1 in neuronal CREB-dependent gene expression, we next tested whether CRTC1 directly bound IEG promoters. We prepared cortical neurons in which Myc-tagged CRTC1 was expressed to a minimal level, such that no additional increase in transcription activity was detectable in sensitive reporter assays (Figure S4A). Quantitative ChIP assays using an anti-Myc antibody revealed that CRTC1 was complexed in an activity-dependent manner with the promoters of Arc, c-fos, and BDNF, and rather constitutively with the zif-268 promoter (Figure 4 A). ChIP assays using anti-CRTC1 antibodies further confirmed the binding of endogenous CRTC1 to CRE sites of IEG promoters in high K+-treated cortical neurons (Figure S4B). To examine if CRTC1 associates with the promoters via CREB, we coexpressed A-CREB, a specific inhibitor of CREB function that binds to bZIP domain of CREB with high affinity (Ahn et al., 1998Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. A dominant-negative inhibitor of CREB reveals that it is a general mediator of stimulus-dependent transcription of c-fos.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Expression of A-CREB completely blocked CRTC1-dependent transcription activity (Figure 4B; see also Figure S4G). Together, we conclude that a functional CRTC1-CREB complex was recruited to the CRE sites in IEG promoters in an activity-regulated manner. To examine the target specificity of CRTC1 on CRE sites among many regulatory elements in the promoter, we took advantage of the Arc promoter, which contains a single half-CRE site in the distal enhancer element termed SARE (Kawashima et al., 2009Kawashima T. Okuno H. Nonaka M. Adachi-Morishima A. Kyo N. Okamura M. Takemoto-Kimura S. Worley P.F. Bito H. Synaptic activity-responsive element in the Arc/Arg3.1 promoter essential for synapse-to-nucleus signaling in activated neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) that is positioned about 7 kb upstream of the transcription start site of Arc gene (Figure 4C). Knockdown of CRTC1 significantly attenuated the synaptic activity-dependent component of the full-length Arc promoter activity, and this effect was reversed at least in part by expression of WT-CRTC1res (Figure 4D). Furthermore, expression of caCRTC1 increased the transcriptional activity of the promoter in the presence of TTX to a level similar to that observed in control neurons stimulated with BIC/4AP (Figure 4E). The combination of caCRTC1 expression and BIC/4AP treatment induced an additive effect, whereas mutation of the half-CRE site in the Arc promoter abolished the effects of caCRTC1 both in TTX and in BIC/4AP (Figure 4E). Next, to test if there is any local interaction, we used the SARE-minCMV promoter (Figure 4F). This promoter was large"

The objective of this study was to evaluate ECM and collagen content within normal glandular prostate tissue and glandular BPH, and to evaluate the association of clinical parameters of LUTS with collagen content.Fibrillar collagen and ECM content was assessed in normal prostate (48 patients) and glandular BPH nodules (24 patients) using Masson's trichrome stain and Picrosirius red stain. Second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging was used to evaluate collagen content. Additional BPH tissues (n = 47) were stained with Picrosirius red and the association between clinical parameters of BPH/LUTS and collagen content was assessed.ECM was similar in normal prostate and BPH (p = 0.44). Total collagen content between normal prostate and glandular BPH was similar (p = 0.27), but a significant increase in thicker collagen bundles was observed in BPH (p = 0.045). Using SHG imaging, collagen content in BPH (mean intensity = 62.52; SEM = 2.74) was significantly higher than in normal prostate (51.77±3.49; p = 0.02). Total collagen content was not associated with treatment with finasteride (p = 0.47) or α-blockers (p = 0.52), pre-TURP AUA symptom index (p = 0.90), prostate-specific antigen (p = 0.86), post-void residual (PVR; p = 0.32), prostate size (p = 0.21), or post-TURP PVR (p = 0.51). Collagen content was not associated with patient age in patients with BPH, however as men aged normal prostatic tissue had a decreased proportion of thick collagen bundles.The proportion of larger bundles of collagen, but not total collagen, is increased in BPH nodules, suggesting that these large fibers may play a role in BPH/LUTS. Total collagen content is independent of clinical parameters of BPH and LUTS. If fibrosis and overall ECM deposition are associated with BPH/LUTS, this relationship likely exists in regions of the prostate other than glandular hyperplasia."

More specific knowledge regarding the in vivo function of CHH family peptides is very limited because pleiotropism and structural similarity among these peptides have largely impeded detailed analyses. Indeed, further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying functional activation of CHH family receptors is crucial for elucidating the biological functions mediated by these ligands; however, advances have been largely impeded by the absence of an identified receptor from any species for these peptides. Most neuropeptide receptors, with few exceptions, belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily (25.Caers J. Verlinden H. Zels S. Vandersmissen H.P. Vuerinckx K. Schoofs L.

Indeed, the estimated molecular weight of receptors for CHH family peptides in crustacean species coincides with those of class A and B GPCRs (26.Zmora N. Trant J. Zohar Y. Chung J.S.

Vuerinckx K. Schoofs L. More than two decades of research on insect neuropeptide GPCRs: an overview.Front.

Kataoka H. Neuropeptide receptor transcriptome reveals unidentified neuroendocrine pathways.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the biological actions of CHH family peptides in ecdysozoans are mediated by GPCRs. In the present study, we used Ca2+ imaging to screen 34 orphan B. mori neuropeptide GPCRs (BNGRs) (28.Yamanaka N. Yamamoto S. Zitnan D. Watanabe K. Kawada T. Satake H. Kaneko Y. Hiruma K. Tanaka Y. Shinoda T. Kataoka H. Neuropeptide receptor transcriptome reveals unidentified neuroendocrine pathways.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) for activation by ITPs. Based on this screening, we identified and characterized, using both in vitro and ex vivo experiments, three BNGRs that function as receptors for ITPs. We also discuss the intercellular cGMP-generating pathways utilized by the ITPs and their cognate receptors. Silkworm eggs from a B. mori racial hybrid, Kinshu × Showa (Ueda Sanshu), were used for all experiments. Larvae were reared in plastic containers at 26 ± 1 °C with 70 ± 10% relative humidity under long day lighting conditions (16 h light/8 h dark), using the SILKMATE 2S artificial diet (Nihon Nosan Kogyo). Total RNA (1 µg) extracted from the brain of B. mori larvae using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) were used for cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT)12–18 primer with SuperScript III (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was carried out with KOD-Plus (Toyobo) using ITP- and ITPL-specific primers designed based on the nucleotide sequences of ITP (GenBankTM accession number AY950502) and ITPL (GenBankTM accession number AY950503). The common forward primer (5′-GGCGATATCatgAGCTTCTTCACCCTGGAGTGCAAGGGCG-3′) includes an additional three bases (italic type), EcoRV site (boldface type), start codon (lowercase letters), and subsequent 5′-terminal sequence of ORF of ITPs, with optimization of the codon usage for expression in E. coli (underlined). The reverse primer for ITP (5′-GGCGAATTCttaGCCGACGAAGTCGATCATTTG-3′) includes the 3′-terminal sequence of ORF, followed by an additional codon for the amidating donor residue, Gly (underlined), stop codon (lowercase letters), EcoRI site (boldface type), and three additional bases (italic type). The reverse primer for ITPL (5′-GGCGAATTCctaAATCCCCGGGTCAGCCCCG-3′) includes the 3′-terminal sequence of ORF, stop codon (lowercase letters), EcoRI site (boldface type), and three additional bases (italic type). The following program was used for amplification: 20 s (140 s for the first cycle) at 94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 30 s at 68 °C, for 30 cycles. The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The resultant plasmid was digested with EcoRV and EcoRI and then ligated with the EcoRV/EcoRI-digested pET32a(+) vector (Novagen). Competent cells of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus strain (Stratagene) were transformed separately with the constructed plasmid containing the cDNA of ITP or ITPL and selected on LB plates with ampicillin (50 µg/ml). The transformed bacterial cells were picked up from a single colony and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h in LB medium with ampicillin (50 µg/ml). The culture was then inoculated into a 50-fold volume of the same medium and incubated at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5–0.6. Then isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mm. After additional incubation for 4 h, bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial cells expressing ITPs were suspended in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) with 0.02% lysozyme. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h and freezing at −80 °C for over 1 h, the suspension was sonicated. The sonicated mixture was centrifuged (4 °C, 5,000 × g, 10 min). Recombinant ITP (rITP)-Gly and recombinant ITPL (rITPL) collected as an inclusion body were dissolved into 7.5 mm guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm EDTA. After lyophilization, these recombinants were dissolved into 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at a final concentration of ∼0.1 mg/ml. The resultant mixture was diluted with a 3-fold volume of the dilution buffer (0.6 m Tris-HCl, 9.6% glycerol, 2.4 mm reduced form guanidine, pH 8.0). After the addition of oxidized form guanidine to the mixture at a final concentration of 1 mm, the mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 2 days for refolding of the recombinants. The recombinants were then purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a Shodex Asahipak ODP-50 column (10-mm inner diameter × 250 mm, Showa Denko) with a 30-min linear gradient of 20–50% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. To obtain rITP with C-terminal amidation, the amidating reaction of rITP-Gly was performed as reported previously (14.Wang Y.J. Zhao Y. Meredith J. Phillips J.E. Theilmann D.A. Brock H.W. Mutational analysis of the C-terminus in ion transport peptide (ITP) expressed in Drosophila Kc1 cells.Arch. Insect Biochem.

For confocal microscopic examination, we constructed expression plasmids for C-terminally enhanced GFP (EGFP)-fused BNGR-A2, -A24, and -A34 by overlap extension PCR using gene-specific primers indicated in Table 1. The following program was used for amplification: 20 s (140 s for the first cycle) at 94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C and 30–150 s at 68 °C, for 35 cycles. In the case of EGFP-fused BNGR-A2 (pME18S-BNGR-A2-EGFP), the first PCR entailed amplification of the complete coding region of BNGR-A2 minus the stop codon from the plasmid, pME18S-BNGR-A2, by using the gene-specific sense primer, Bst-A2_Fw, and the chimeric antisense primer, A2-E_Rv, with KOD-plus (Toyobo). The second amplification involved the EGFP cDNA sequence from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), using the chimeric sense primer, A2-E_Fw, and the EGFP gene-specific antisense primer including the stop codon, Xho-*E_Rv. These chimeric primers consist of the last 15 bases of the BNGR-A2 coding region and the first 15 bases of the EGFP coding region. The final reaction involved the products from the two previous reactions as templates and utilized BNGR-A2 gene-specific sense primer and EGFP gene-specific antisense primer. The resulting product with BstXI and XhoI sites was digested with the restriction enzymes and then was ligated with the pME18S plasmid digested with the same enzymes. The expression plasmids for BNGR-A24-EGFP and BNGR-A34-EGFP were also constructed by similar procedures.TABLE 1Primers for construction of expression vectors for BNGRsPrimer nameSequence (from 5′ to 3′)aThe gene-specific primers include additional three bases (lowercase letters), a BstXI or XhoI restriction site (italic type), and a stop codon (boldface type).

Open table in a new tab To express transiently BNGR-A2, -A24, and -A34 in BmN cells, the pIE1/153A(V4+) insect expression plasmids (CytoStore) were constructed. In the case of BNGR-A2, a cDNA encoding BNGR-A2 was amplified by PCR using pME18S-BNGR-A2 as a template and the gene-specific primers Bst-A2_Fw and Xho-*A2_Rv (Table 1). The amplification program and subsequent procedure were similar in the case of pME18S-BNGR-A2-EGFP as described above. The deduced amino acid sequences of BNGR-A2, -A24, -A34, and these orthologs were obtained from GenBankTM by BLAST searches (blastn and tblastn). The transmembrane regions in BNGRs were estimated by the TMHMM version 2.0 program. Phylogenetic trees were generated by the neighbor-joining method. One day after being seeded on a 35-mm glass-based dish (Iwaki), HEK293T cells (4–5 × 105 cells) were co-transfected with pME18S plasmids carrying BNGR cDNAs and the promiscuous G protein Gα15 subunit, using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After incubation for 24 h, the transfected cells were loaded with 500 µl of the Ca2+ indicator solution (2 µm Fluo-4 AM (Dojin Chemicals), 0.01% pluronic-F 127 (Anaspec) in Opti-MEM) at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with Ringer's solution (140 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 9.4 mm d-glucose, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and then 800 µl of Ringer's solution was added. The assays were performed within 2 h after replacement of the medium with Ringer's solution. Fluo-4-derived fluorescence was monitored using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (FV-1000D, Olympus) under the following conditions: magnification of objective, 20-fold; field of view, 512 × 512; dye, Fluo-3; photomultiplier tube, 500 V; gain, 3–4; offset, 0%; color mode, Spec I; scan speed, 1.08 s/scan. Cells were monitored for 500 s with 100 µl of the following supplements in Ringer's solution added sequentially at 60, 120, 240, and 420 s: Ringer's solution (vehicle control), 100 nm rITP or rITPL, 10 µm isoproterenol (an agonist for the endogenously expressed β2 adrenaline receptor; Sigma-Aldrich), and 100 µm ATP (a ligand for the ATP receptor; used as an experimental control by causing robust intracellular Ca2+ increases). The time course of the fluorescence was analyzed using more than 20 cells, which showed no response to the addition of Ringer's solution, as represented by the relative fluorescent intensity (0%, an initial intensity; 100%, maximum intensity during monitoring). Independent experiments were performed three times. The dose-response curves were generated using KaleidaGraph version 4.1.0 software (Hulinks) with the “sigmoidal” fitting program. The EC50 values were calculated from the obtained fitting curves. Tissues were dissected out in 0.9% NaCl solution from anesthetized B. mori larvae at the fifth instar day 2 fed ad libitum and after 24-h starvation. Total RNA extraction and subsequent cDNA synthesis were performed as described above. In the case of RNA extraction from BmN cells, partial cDNA fragments of BNGRs, ITP, ITPL, and ribosomal protein L32 (RPL32) (GenBankTM accession number NM_001098282) were amplified with GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega), using the gene-specific primers indicated in Table 2.

https://openalex.org/W2130791251,"Abnormal dendritic complexity is a shared feature of many neurodevelopmental disorders associated with neurological defects. Here, we found that the actin-crosslinking protein filamin A (FLNA) is overexpressed in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) mice, a PI3K-mTOR model of neurodevelopmental disease that is associated with abnormal dendritic complexity. Both under- and overexpression of FLNA in wild-type neurons led to more complex dendritic arbors in vivo, suggesting that an optimal level of FLNA expression is required for normal dendritogenesis. In Tsc1(null) neurons, knocking down FLNA in vivo prevented dendritic abnormalities. Surprisingly, FLNA overexpression in Tsc1(null) neurons was dependent on MEK1/2 but not mTOR activity, despite both pathways being hyperactive. In addition, increasing MEK-ERK1/2 activity led to dendritic abnormalities via FLNA, and decreasing MEK-ERK1/2 signaling in Tsc1(null) neurons rescued dendritic defects. These data demonstrate that altered FLNA expression increases dendritic complexity and contributes to pathologic dendritic patterning in TSC in an mTOR-independent, ERK1/2-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2124552207,"The lack of the neuropeptide orexin, also known as hypocretin, results in narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder characterized by frequent sleep/cataplexy attacks and rapid eye movement sleep abnormalities. However, the downstream pathways of orexin signaling are not clearly understood. Here, we show that orexin activates the mTOR pathway, a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism, in the mouse brain and multiple recombinant cell lines that express the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) or orexin 2 receptor (OX2R). This orexin/GPCR-stimulated mTOR activation is sensitive to rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) but is independent of two well known mTORC1 activators, Erk and Akt. Rather, our studies indicate that orexin activates mTORC1 via extracellular calcium influx and the lysosome pathway involving v-ATPase and Rag GTPases. Moreover, a cytoplasmic calcium transient is sufficient to mimic orexin/GPCR signaling to mTORC1 activation in a v-ATPase-dependent manner. Together, our studies suggest that the mTORC1 pathway functions downstream of orexin/GPCR signaling, which plays a crucial role in many physiological and metabolic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2056080816,"Here, we address the question of why some people have a greater chance of surviving and/or better resistance to cold-related-injuries in prolonged exposure to acute cold environments than do others, despite similar physical characteristics. The main aim of this study was to compare physiological and psychological reactions between people who exhibited fast cooling (FC; n = 20) or slow cooling (SC; n = 20) responses to cold water immersion. Individuals in whom the Tre decreased to a set point of 35.5°C before the end of the 170-min cooling time were indicated as the FC group; individuals in whom the Tre did not decrease to the set point of 35.5°C before the end of the 170-min cooling time were classified as the SC group. Cold stress was induced using intermittent immersion in bath water at 14°C. Motor (spinal and supraspinal reflexes, voluntary and electrically induced skeletal muscle contraction force) and cognitive (executive function, short term memory, short term spatial recognition) performance, immune variables (neutrophils, leucocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, IL-6, TNF-α), markers of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity (cortisol, corticosterone) and autonomic nervous system activity (epinephrine, norepinephrine) were monitored. The data obtained in this study suggest that the response of the FC group to cooling vs the SC group response was more likely an insulative–hypothermic response and that the SC vs the FC group displayed a metabolic–insulative response. The observations that an exposure time to 14°C cold water—which was nearly twice as short (96-min vs 170-min) with a greater rectal temperature decrease (35.5°C vs 36.2°C) in the FC group compared with the SC group—induces similar responses of motor, cognitive, and blood stress markers were novel. The most important finding is that subjects with a lower cold-strain-index (SC group) showed stimulation of some markers of innate immunity and suppression of markers of specific immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2042801066,"Second generation Bt crops (insect resistant crops carrying Bacillus thuringiensis genes) combine more than one gene that codes for insecticidal proteins in the same plant to provide better control of agricultural pests. Some of the new combinations involve co-expression of cry and vip genes. Because Cry and Vip proteins have different midgut targets and possibly different mechanisms of toxicity, it is important to evaluate possible synergistic or antagonistic interactions between these two classes of toxins. Three members of the Cry1 class of proteins and three from the Vip3A class were tested against Heliothis virescens for possible interactions. At the level of LC50, Cry1Ac was the most active protein, whereas the rest of proteins tested were similarly active. However, at the level of LC90, Cry1Aa and Cry1Ca were the least active proteins, and Cry1Ac and Vip3A proteins were not significantly different. Under the experimental conditions used in this study, we found an antagonistic effect of Cry1Ca with the three Vip3A proteins. The interaction between Cry1Ca and Vip3Aa was also tested on two other species of Lepidoptera. Whereas antagonism was observed in Spodoptera frugiperda, synergism was found in Diatraea saccharalis. In all cases, the interaction between Vip3A and Cry1 proteins was more evident at the LC90 level than at the LC50 level. The fact that the same combination of proteins may result in a synergistic or an antagonistic interaction may be an indication that there are different types of interactions within the host, depending on the insect species tested."
https://openalex.org/W2126478082,"It is increasingly recognized that the efficacy of medical treatments is determined in critical part by the therapeutic context in which it is delivered. An important characteristic of that context is treatment history. We recently reported first evidence for a carry-over of treatment experience to subsequent treatment response across different treatment approaches. Here we expand on these findings by exploring the psychological and neurobiological underpinnings of the effect of treatment experience on future treatment response in an experimental model of placebo analgesia with a conditioning procedure. In a combined behavioral and neuroimaging study we experimentally induced positive or negative experiences with an analgesic treatment in two groups of healthy human subjects. Subsequently we compared responses to a second, different analgesic treatment between both groups. We found that participants with an experimentally induced negative experience with the first treatment showed a substantially reduced response to a second analgesic treatment. Intriguingly, several psychological trait variables including anxiety, depression and locus of control modulate the susceptibility for the effects of prior treatment experiences on future treatment outcome. These behavioral effects were supported by neuroimaging data which showed significant differences in brain regions encoding pain and analgesia between groups. These differences in activation patterns were present not only during the pain phase, but also already prior to painful stimulation and scaled with the individual treatment response. Our data provide behavioral and neurobiological evidence showing that the influence of treatment history transfers over time and over therapeutic approaches. Our experimental findings emphasize the careful consideration of treatment history and a strictly systematic treatment approach to avoid negative carry-over effects."
https://openalex.org/W1983276280,"The main function of the 3'-5' DNA exonuclease TREX1 is to digest cytosolic single-stranded DNA to prevent activation of cell-intrinsic responses to immunostimulatory DNA. TREX1 translocates to the nucleus following DNA damage with its nuclear activities being less well defined. Although mutations in human TREX1 have been linked to autoimmune/inflammatory diseases, the mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of these diseases remain incompletely understood. Here, using mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation assays and in vivo overexpression models, we show that TREX1 interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1), a nuclear enzyme involved in the DNA damage response. Two zinc finger domains at the amino terminus of PARP1 were required for the interaction with TREX1 that occurs after nuclear translocation of TREX1 in response to DNA damage. Functional studies suggested that TREX1 may contribute to stabilization of PARP1 levels in the DNA damage response and its activity. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of single-stranded DNA repair following DNA damage and alterations induced by gene mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2090354722,"Bacterial biofilms causing implant-associated osteomyelitis is a severe complication with limited antimicrobial therapy options. We designed an animal model, in which implant associated osteomyelitis arise from a Staphylococcus aureus biofilm on a tibia implant. Two bioluminescently engineered (luxA-E transformed), strains of S. aureus were utilized, Xen29 and Xen31. Biofilm formation was assessed with epifluorescence microscopy. Quantitative measurements were performed day 4, 6, 8, 11 and 15 post-surgery. Bacteria were extracted from the biofilm by sonication and the bacterial load quantified by culturing. Biofilm formation was evident from day 6 post-implantation. Mean bacterial load from implants was ∼1×104 CFU/implant, while mean bacterial load from infected tibias were 1×106 CFU/bone. Bioluminesence imaging revealed decreasing activity throughout the 15-day observation period, with signal intensity for both strains reaching that of the negative control by day 15 while there was no significant reduction in bacterial load.

https://openalex.org/W2043218053,"The structural organization of neural circuits is strongly influenced by experience, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We found that, in the developing dentate gyrus (DG), excitatory drive promotes the somatic innervation of principal granule cells (GCs) by parvalbumin (PV)-positive basket cells. In contrast, presynaptic differentiation of GCs and interneuron subtypes that inhibit GC dendrites is largely resistant to loss of glutamatergic neurotransmission. The networks of PV basket cells in the DG are regulated by vesicular release from projection entorhinal cortical neurons and, at least in part, by NMDA receptors in interneurons. Finally, we present evidence that glutamatergic inputs and NMDA receptors regulate these networks through a presynaptic mechanism that appears to control the branching of interneuron axons. Our results provide insights into how cortical activity tunes the inhibition in a subcortical circuit and reveal new principles of interneuron plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2038026688,"We previously reported that the ClpXP ATP-dependent protease specifically recognizes and degrades the flagellar master transcriptional activator complex, FlhD4C2, to negatively control flagellar biogenesis. The flagellum-related protein, FliT, is also a negative regulator of flagellar regulon by inhibiting the binding of FlhD4C2 to the promoter DNA. We have found a novel pathway of FliT inhibition of FlhD4C2 activity connected to ClpXP proteolysis. An in vitro degradation assay using purified proteins shows that FliT selectively increases ClpXP proteolysis of the FlhC subunit in the FlhD4C2 complex. FliT behaves specifically to ClpXP-dependent proteolysis of FlhC. An in vitro interaction assay detects the ternary complex of FliT-FlhD4C2-ClpX. FliT promotes the affinity of ClpX against FlhD4C2 complex, whereas FliT does not directly interact with ClpX. Thus, FliT interacts with the FlhC in FlhD4C2 complex and increases the presentation of the FlhC recognition region to ClpX. The DNA-bound form of FlhD4C2 complex is resistant to ClpXP proteolysis. We suggest that the role of FliT in negatively controlling the flagellar gene expression involves increasing free molecules of FlhD4C2 sensitive to ClpXP proteolysis by inhibiting the binding to the promoter DNA as well as enhancing the selective proteolysis of FlhC subunit by ClpXP."
https://openalex.org/W2028797127,"Mutualistic relationships are beneficial for both partners and are often studied within a single environment. However, when the range of the partners is large, geographical differences in selective pressure may shift the relationship outcome from positive to negative. The marine bryozoan Bugula neritina is a colonial invertebrate common in temperate waters worldwide. It is the source of bioactive polyketide metabolites, the bryostatins. Evidence suggests that an uncultured vertically transmitted symbiont, ""Candidatus Endobugula sertula"", hosted by B. neritina produces the bryostatins, which protect the vulnerable larvae from predation. Studies of B. neritina along the North American Atlantic coast revealed a complex of two morphologically similar sibling species separated by an apparent biogeographic barrier: the Type S sibling species was found below Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, while Type N was found above. Interestingly, the Type N colonies lack ""Ca. Endobugula sertula"" and, subsequently, defensive bryostatins; their documented northern distribution was consistent with traditional biogeographical paradigms of latitudinal variation in predation pressure. Upon further sampling of B. neritina populations, we found that both host types occur in wider distribution, with Type N colonies living south of Cape Hatteras, and Type S to the north. Distribution of the symbiont, however, was not restricted to Type S hosts. Genetic and microscopic evidence demonstrates the presence of the symbiont in some Type N colonies, and larvae from these colonies are endowed with defensive bryostatins and contain ""Ca. Endobugula sertula"". Molecular analysis of the symbiont from Type N colonies suggests an evolutionarily recent acquisition, which is remarkable for a symbiont thought to be transmitted only vertically. Furthermore, most Type S colonies found at higher latitudes lack the symbiont, suggesting that this host-symbiont relationship is more flexible than previously thought. Our data suggest that the symbiont, but not the host, is restricted by biogeographical boundaries."

Regression percentiles of HbA1c were calculated as a function of age and gender by the quantile regression method using the SAS procedure QUANTREG.Crude percentiles of HbA1c as a function of age and gender, and the modeled curves produced using quantile regression showed good concordance. The curves show a decline in HbA1c levels from age 2 to 4 years at each percentile. Thereafter, there is a gradual increase during the prepubertal years with a peak at ages 12 to 14 years. HbA1c levels subsequently decline to the lowest values in the third decade. Curves of females and males followed closely, with females having HbA1c levels about 0.1% (1.1 mmol/mol) higher in the 25th 50th and 75th percentiles.We constructed age-specific distribution curves for HbA1c levels for patients with T1DM. These percentiles may be used to demonstrate the individual patient's measurements longitudinally compared with age-matched patients."
https://openalex.org/W1976120350,"The topic of unconscious influences on behaviour has long been explored as a means of understanding human performance and the neurobiological correlates of intention, motivation, and action. However, what is relatively unknown is whether subconsciously delivered priming stimuli, with or without rewards, can affect individuals' maximum level of force produced with their best effort. We demonstrated using transcranial magnetic stimulation that barely visible priming of an action concept, when combined with a reward in the form of a consciously visible positive stimulus, could alter the state of the motor system. In accordance with this neurophysiological alteration, the prime-plus-reward stimuli significantly increased the hand-grip force level of maximum voluntary contraction with little conscious awareness. This is the first objective evidence that the barely conscious presence of a behavioral goal can influence the state of the motor system and arouse latent ability for human force exertion."
https://openalex.org/W2009745643,"Drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) have been associated with chemotherapy resistance and are considered unfavorable prognostic factors for survival of cancer patients. Analyzing mRNA expression levels of a subset of drug transporters by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or protein expression by tissue microarray (TMA) in tumor samples of therapy naïve stage IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (qRT-PCR, n = 40; TMA, n = 61), this in situ study re-examined the significance of transporter expression for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database was used to externally validate the respective findings (n = 317). In general, HNSCC tended to lower expression of drug transporters compared to normal epithelium. High ABCB1 mRNA tumor expression was associated with both favorable progression-free survival (PFS, p = 0.0357) and overall survival (OS, p = 0.0535). Similar results were obtained for the mRNA of ABCC1 (MRP1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1; PFS, p = 0.0183; OS, p = 0.038). In contrast, protein expression of ATP7b (copper transporter ATP7b), mRNA expression of ABCG2 (BCRP, breast cancer resistance protein), ABCC2 (MRP2), and SLC31A1 (hCTR1, human copper transporter 1) did not correlate with survival. Cluster analysis however revealed that simultaneous high expression of SLC31A1, ABCC2, and ABCG2 indicates poor survival of HNSCC patients. In conclusion, this study militates against the intuitive dogma where high expression of drug efflux transporters indicates poor survival, but demonstrates that expression of single drug transporters might indicate even improved survival. Prospectively, combined analysis of the ‘transportome’ should rather be performed as it likely unravels meaningful data on the impact of drug transporters on survival of patients with HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W1979237559,"Adseverin (Ads), a member of the Gelsolin superfamily of actin binding proteins, regulates the actin cytoskeleton architecture by severing and capping existing filamentous actin (F-actin) strands and nucleating the assembly of new F-actin filaments. Ads has been implicated in cellular secretion, exocytosis and has also been shown to regulate chondrogenesis and megakaryoblastic leukemia cell differentiation. Here we report for the first time that Ads is involved in regulating osteoclastogenesis (OCG). Ads is induced during OCG downstream of RANK-ligand (RANKL) stimulation and is highly expressed in mature osteoclasts. The D5 isoform of Ads is not involved in regulating OCG, as its expression is not induced in response to RANKL. Three clonal Ads knockdown RAW264.7 (RAW) macrophage cell lines with varying degrees of Ads expression and OCG deficiency were generated. The most drastic OCG defect was noted in the clonal cell line with the greatest degree of Ads knockdown as indicated by a lack of TRAcP staining and multinucleation. RNAi mediated knockdown of Ads in osteoclast precursors resulted in distinct morphological changes characterized by altered F-actin distribution and increased filopodia formation. Ads knockdown precursor cells experienced enhanced migration while fusion of knockdown precursors cells was limited. Transient reintroduction of de novo Ads back into the knockdown system was capable of rescuing TRAcP expression but not osteoclast multinucleation most likely due to the transient nature of Ads expression. This preliminary study allows us to conclude that Ads is a RANKL induced early regulator of OCG with a potential role in pre-osteoclast differentiation and fusion."

The survival and growth of several types of cancer depend on autonomously activated SHH-GLI signaling. A protein complex containing the ubiquitin ligase MID1 and protein phosphatase 2A regulates the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of GLI3, a transcriptional effector molecule of SHH, in cancer cell lines with autonomously activated SHH signaling. However, the exact molecular mechanisms that mediate the interaction between MID1 and GLI3 remained unknown. Here, we show that MID1 catalyzes the ubiquitination and proteasomal cleavage of the GLI3 regulator Fu. Our data suggest that Fu ubiquitination and cleavage is one of the key elements connecting the MID1-PP2A protein complex with GLI3 activity control."
https://openalex.org/W2107110754,"The regulation of integrins expressed on leukocytes must be controlled precisely, and members of different integrin subfamilies have to act in concert to ensure the proper traffic of immune cells to sites of inflammation. The activation of β2 family integrins through the T cell receptor or by chemokines leads to the inactivation of very late antigen 4. The mechanism(s) of this cross-talk has not been known. We have now elucidated in detail how the signals are transmitted from leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 and show that, after its activation, the signaling involves specific phosphorylations of β2 integrin followed by interactions with cytoplasmic signaling proteins. This results in loss of β1 phosphorylation and a decrease in very late antigen 4 binding to its ligand vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. Our results show how a member of one integrin family regulates the activity of another integrin. This is important for the understanding of integrin-mediated processes."

https://openalex.org/W1993080870,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified multiple loci for blood pressure (BP) and hypertension. Six genes--ATP2B1, CACNB2, CYP17A1, JAG1, PLEKHA7, and SH2B3--were evaluated for sequence variation with large effects on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP).Targeted genomic sequence was determined in 4,178 European ancestry participants from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium. Common variants (≥50 minor allele copies) were evaluated individually and rare variants (minor allele frequency, MAF≤1%) were aggregated by locus. 464 common variants were identified across the 6 genes. An upstream CYP17A1 variant, rs11191416 (MAF = 0.09), was the most significant association for SBP (P = 0.0005); however the association was attenuated (P = 0.0469) after conditioning on the GWAS index single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). A PLEKHA7 intronic variant was the strongest DBP association (rs12806040, MAF = 0.007, P = 0.0006) and was not in LD (r² = 0.01) with the GWAS SNP. A CACNB2 intronic SNP, rs1571787, was the most significant association with PP (MAF = 0.27, P = 0.0003), but was not independent from the GWAS SNP (r² = 0.34). Three variants (rs6163 and rs743572 in the CYP17A1 region and rs112467382 in PLEKHA7) were associated with BP traits (P<0.001). Rare variation, aggregately assessed in the 6 regions, was not significantly associated with BP measures.Six targeted gene regions, previously identified by GWAS, did not harbor novel variation with large effects on BP in this sample."
https://openalex.org/W2003999057,"Background In China, spouse caregivers of cancer patients (SCCPs) are involved in all aspects of patient care and experience psychological distress which could result in sleep disturbance and fatigue. However, few studies have explored the differences between SCCPs and the general population, or what factors affect SCCPs' sleep. This study aims to (1) Compare the differences in sleep disturbances and fatigue severity between SCCPs and the age- and gender-matched general population, and (2) Identify selected personal characteristics, including coping style that affect sleep disturbances in SCCPs. Methodology/Principal Findings The Stress and Coping Model was used to guide this study. Participants were recruited from the northeast part of China and included 600 people from the general population and 300 SCCPs. Participants completed a socio-demographic form, Fatigue Scale-14, trait Coping Style Questionnaire, and Symptom Checklist-90. Results The majority of the participants were middle age, most of whom (78.7%) spent more than 8 hours each day taking care of their spouses. Compared to the general population, the SCCPs experienced significant sleep disturbances with a mean of 7.30 (SD = 1.27), and fatigue severity with a mean of 8.11 (SD = 3.25). Among the selected SCCPs' personal characteristics, current poor health status (β = 0.14, P<0.001), having a spouse under mixed treatment (β = 0.13, p<0.001), and financial burden (β = 0.14, P<0.001) are the significant predictors for sleep disturbances. Positive coping is the predictor for fewer sleep disturbances (β = 0.27, P<0.001). Those who reported sleep disturbances also experienced higher physical and mental fatigue severity (P<0.001). Conclusion Intervention to improve coping style in SCCPs is needed. Further research is also needed to explore the other mediators and moderators that regulate sleep disturbance and health outcomes in the SCCPs."
https://openalex.org/W2170071314,"Solution hybridization capture methods utilize biotinylated oligonucleotides as baits to enrich homologous sequences from next generation sequencing (NGS) libraries. Coupled with NGS, the method generates kilo to gigabases of high confidence consensus targeted sequence. However, in many experiments, a non-negligible fraction of the resulting sequence reads are not homologous to the bait. We demonstrate that during capture, the bait-hybridized library molecules add additional flanking library sequences iteratively, such that baits limited to targeting relatively short regions (e.g. few hundred nucleotides) can result in enrichment across entire mitochondrial and bacterial genomes. Our findings suggest that some of the off-target sequences derived in capture experiments are non-randomly enriched, and that CapFlank will facilitate targeted enrichment of large contiguous sequences with minimal prior target sequence information."
https://openalex.org/W2044477380,"The oncoprotein MDM2 binds to tumor suppressor protein p53 and inhibits its anticancer activity, which leads to promotion of tumor cell growth and tumor survival. Abrogation of the p53:MDM2 interaction reportedly results in reactivation of the p53 pathway and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. We recently performed rigorous selection of MDM2-binding peptides by means of mRNA display and identified an optimal 12-mer peptide (PRFWEYWLRLME), named MDM2 Inhibitory Peptide (MIP), which shows higher affinity for MDM2 (and also its homolog, MDMX) and higher tumor cell proliferation suppression activity than known peptides. Here we determined the NMR solution structure of a MIP-MDM2 fusion protein to elucidate the structural basis of the tight binding of MIP to MDM2. A region spanning from Phe3 to Met11 of MIP forms a single α-helix, which is longer than those of the other MDM2-binding peptides. MIP shares a conserved Phe3-Trp7-Leu10 triad, whose side chains are oriented towards and fit into the hydrophobic pockets of MDM2. Additionally, hydrophobic surface patches that surround the hydrophobic pockets of MDM2 are covered by solvent-exposed MIP residues, Trp4, Tyr6, and Met11. Their hydrophobic interactions extend the interface of the two molecules and contribute to the strong binding. The potential MDM2 inhibition activity observed for MIP turned out to originate from its enlarged binding interface. The structural information obtained in the present study provides a road map for the rational design of strong inhibitors of MDM2:p53 binding."

Phomopsis occulta is a new, salt-tolerant fungus isolated from mangrove Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre. We report here the inhibitory effects of secondary metabolites from Ph. occulta on the aggregation of Aβ42. It was found that mycelia extracts (MEs) from Ph. occulta cultured with 0, 2, and 3 M NaCl exhibited inhibitory activity in an E. coli model of Aβ aggregation. A water-soluble fraction, ME0-W-F1, composed of mainly small peptides, was able to reduce aggregation of an Aβ42-EGFP fusion protein and an early onset familial mutation Aβ42E22G-mCherry fusion protein in transfected HEK293 cells. ME0-W-F1 also antagonized the cytotoxicity of Aβ42 in the neural cell line SH-SY5Y in dose-dependent manner. Moreover, SDS-PAGE and FT-IR analysis confirmed an inhibitory effect of ME0-W-F1 on the aggregation of Aβ42 in vitro. ME0-W-F1 blocked the conformational transition of Aβ42 from α-helix/random coil to β-sheet, and thereby inhibited formation of Aβ42 tetramers and high molecular weight oligomers. ME0-W-F1 and other water-soluble secondary metabolites from Ph. occulta therefore represent new candidate natural products against aggregation of Aβ42, and illustrate the potential of salt tolerant fungi from mangrove as resources for the treatment of AD and other diseases."

Molecular methods are commonly used in the study of AM fungal communities. However, the biases associated with PCR amplification of these organisms and their ability to be utilized quantitatively has never been fully tested. We used Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis to characterise artificial community templates containing known quantities of defined AM fungal genotypes. This was compared to a parallel in silico analysis that predicted the results of this experiment in the absence of bias. The data suggest that when used quantitatively the TRFLP protocol tested is a powerful, repeatable method for AM fungal community analysis. However, we suggest some limitations to its use for population-level analyses. We found no evidence of PCR bias, supporting the quantitative use of other PCR-based methods for the study of AM fungi such as next generation amplicon sequencing. This finding greatly improves our confidence in methods that quantitatively examine AM fungal communities, providing a greater understanding of the ecology of these important fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2034039497,"Cytochrome c is a multifunctional hemoprotein in the mitochondrial intermembrane space whereby its participation in electron shuttling between respiratory complexes III and IV is alternative to its role in apoptosis as a peroxidase activated by interaction with cardiolipin (CL), and resulting in selective CL peroxidation. The switch from electron transfer to peroxidase function requires partial unfolding of the protein upon binding of CL, whose specific features combine negative charges of the two phosphate groups with four hydrophobic fatty acid residues. Assuming that other endogenous small molecule ligands with a hydrophobic chain and a negatively charged functionality may activate cytochrome c into a peroxidase, we investigated two hydrophobic anionic analogues of vitamin E, α-tocopherol succinate (α-TOS) and α-tocopherol phosphate (α-TOP), as potential inducers of peroxidase activity of cytochrome c. NMR studies and computational modeling indicate that they interact with cytochrome c at similar sites previously proposed for CL. Absorption spectroscopy showed that both analogues effectively disrupt the Fe-S(Met(80)) bond associated with unfolding of cytochrome c. We found that α-TOS and α-TOP stimulate peroxidase activity of cytochrome c. Enhanced peroxidase activity was also observed in isolated rat liver mitochondria incubated with α-TOS and tBOOH. A mitochondria-targeted derivative of TOS, triphenylphosphonium-TOS (mito-VES), was more efficient in inducing H2O2-dependent apoptosis in mouse embryonic cytochrome c(+/+) cells than in cytochrome c(-/-) cells. Essential for execution of the apoptotic program peroxidase activation of cytochrome c by α-TOS may contribute to its known anti-cancer pharmacological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2073271173,"Introduction Simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study we combined EEG and fMRI to investigate the structures involved in the processing of different sound pressure levels (SPLs). Methods EEG data were recorded simultaneously with fMRI from 16 healthy volunteers using MR compatible devices at 3 T. Tones with different SPLs were delivered to the volunteers and the N1/P2 amplitudes were included as covariates in the fMRI data analysis in order to compare the structures activated with high and low SPLs. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and ROI analysis were also performed. Additionally, source localisation analysis was performed on the EEG data. Results The integration of averaged ERP parameters into the fMRI analysis showed an extended map of areas exhibiting covariation with the BOLD signal related to the auditory stimuli. The ANOVA and ROI analyses also revealed additional brain areas other than the primary auditory cortex (PAC) which were active with the auditory stimulation at different SPLs. The source localisation analyses showed additional sources apart from the PAC which were active with the high SPLs. Discussion The PAC and the insula play an important role in the processing of different SPLs. In the fMRI analysis, additional activation was found in the anterior cingulate cortex, opercular and orbito-frontal cortices with high SPLs. A strong response of the visual cortex was also found with the high SPLs, suggesting the presence of cross-modal effects."
https://openalex.org/W2081769355,"Objective To investigate the relationship between lipid profiles [including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)] and a mild decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in subjects with normal serum lipid levels. Design and Methods In this study, we included 2647 participants who were ≥40 years old and had normal serum lipid levels. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation was used to estimate the GFR. A mildly reduced eGFR was defined as 60–90 mL/min/1.73 m2. First, multiple linear regression analysis was used to estimate the association of lipid profiles with the eGFR. Then, the levels of each lipid component were divided into four groups, using the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles as cut-off points. Finally, multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association of different lipid components with the risk of mildly reduced eGFR. Results In the group with a mildly reduced eGFR, TG and LDL-C levels were significantly increased, but HDL-C levels were significantly decreased. After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), smoking and drinking, only TC and TG were independently related to the eGFR. Additionally, only TG showed a linear relationship with an increased risk of a mildly reduced eGFR, with the highest quartile group (TG: 108–150 mg/dl [1.22–1.70 mmol/L]) having a significantly increased risk after adjusting for the above factors. Conclusions Triglyceride levels are closely associated with a mildly reduced eGFR in subjects with normal serum lipid levels. Dyslipidemia with lower TG levels could be used as new diagnostic criteria for subjects with mildly reduced renal function."
https://openalex.org/W1975392546,"Voltage/Ca2+i-gated, large conductance K+ (BK) channels result from tetrameric association of α (slo1) subunits. In most tissues, BK protein complexes include regulatory β subunits that contain two transmembrane domains (TM1, TM2), an extracellular loop, and two short intracellular termini. Four BK β types have been identified, each presenting a rather selective tissue-specific expression profile. Thus, BK β modifies current phenotype to suit physiology in a tissue-specific manner. The smooth muscle-abundant BK β1 drastically increases the channel's apparent Ca2+i sensitivity. The resulting phenotype is critical for BK channel activity to increase in response to Ca2+ levels reached near the channel during depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx and myocyte contraction. The eventual BK channel activation generates outward K+ currents that drive the membrane potential in the negative direction and eventually counteract depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx. The BK β1 regions responsible for the characteristic phenotype of β1-containing BK channels remain to be identified. We used patch-clamp electrophysiology on channels resulting from the combination of smooth muscle slo1 (cbv1) subunits with smooth muscle-abundant β1, neuron-abundant β4, or chimeras constructed by swapping β1 and β4 regions, and determined the contribution of specific β1 regions to the BK phenotype. At Ca2+ levels found near the channel during myocyte contraction (10 µM), channel complexes that included chimeras having both TMs from β1 and the remaining regions (“background”) from β4 showed a phenotype (Vhalf, τact, τdeact) identical to that of complexes containing wt β1. This phenotype could not be evoked by complexes that included chimeras combining either β1 TM1 or β1 TM2 with a β4 background. Likewise, β “halves” (each including β1 TM1 or β1 TM2) resulting from interrupting the continuity of the EC loop failed to render the normal phenotype, indicating that physical connection between β1 TMs via the EC loop is also necessary for proper channel function."
https://openalex.org/W2166253993,"When bacterial colonies age most cells enter a stationary phase, but sub-populations of mutant bacteria can continue to grow and accumulate. These sub-populations include bacteria with mutations in rpoB (RNA polymerase β-subunit) or rpoS (RNA polymerase stress-response sigma factor). Here we have identified acetate as a nutrient present in the aging colonies that is utilized by these mutant subpopulations to support their continued growth. Proteome analysis of aging colonies showed that several proteins involved in acetate conversion and utilization were upregulated during aging. Acetate is known to be excreted during the exponential growth phase but can be imported later during the transition to stationary phase and converted to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is used in multiple processes, including feeding into the TCA cycle, generating ATP via the glyoxylate shunt, as a source of acetyl groups for protein modification, and to support fatty acid biosynthesis. We showed that deletion of acs (encodes acetyl-CoA synthetase; converts acetate into acetyl-CoA) significantly reduced the accumulation of rpoB and rpoS mutant subpopulations on aging colonies. Measurement of radioactive acetate uptake showed that the rate of conversion decreased in aging wild-type colonies, was maintained at a constant level in the rpoB mutant, and significantly increased in the aging rpoS mutant. Finally, we showed that the growth of subpopulations on aging colonies was greatly enhanced if the aging colony itself was unable to utilize acetate, leaving more acetate available for mutant subpopulations to use. Accordingly, the data show that the accumulation of subpopulations of rpoB and rpoS mutants on aging colonies is supported by the availability in the aging colony of acetate, and by the ability of the subpopulation cells to convert the acetate to acetyl-CoA."

Using molecular cloning, we have identified three separate domains of UL52. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in extracts from cells transiently expressing HA-tagged UL5, FLAG-UL8, and enhanced GFP-tagged UL52 domains revealed that the N-terminal domain of UL52 primase binds UL5 helicase and the middle domain interacts with the UL8 accessory protein. In addition, an interaction between the single strand DNA-binding protein ICP8 and the UL52 middle domain was observed. The complex between UL5 and UL52 was stabilized by the antiviral compound BAY 54-6322, and mutations providing resistance to the drug obliterate this effect. Our results also suggest a mechanism for accommodating conformational strain resulting from movement of UL5 and UL52 in opposite directions on the lagging strand template, and they identify molecular complexes that can be further examined by structural biology techniques to resolve the mechanism of primer synthesis during herpesvirus replication. Finally, they help to explain the mechanism of action of a novel class of antiviral compounds currently being evaluated in clinical trials."
