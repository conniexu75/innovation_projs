https://openalex.org/W2065603794,"Anomalous water samples have been prepared in fused quartz capillaries from pure water in an unsaturated atmosphere. In agreement with observations of other investigators, water prepared in this manner, after concentration, exhibited an increased viscosity, a lowered vapor pressure, a phase separation at low temperatures, an index of refraction of 1.48 or greater, and a depression of the temperature of maximum density. However, electron microprobe examination indicated that a significant weight fraction of these concentrated anomalous water residues consists of sodium, boron, and oxygen. The presence of about 6 percent boron was also confirmed through neutron activation analyses and by mass spectrometric measurements. A parallel is drawn between the similar physical properties of anomalous water and highly concentrated sodium tetraborate solutions. The possibility of polymorphism in liquid water should be accepted only with serious reservations."

https://openalex.org/W2072266601,"Phylloxera vastatrix Planchon [Stebbins (27) uses the synonym Phylloxera vitifoliae Fitch] is the plant louse which was introduced into Europe from America and became one of the most dreaded enemies of the European grape vine. On American vines the insect usually attacks the leaf producing ugly cecidial growths but not seriously impairing the health of the plants attacked. On European vines, however, the insect does most of its work on the roots, becoming a very destructive pest. Much has been written concerning the life history of this parasite, a large part of which has been brought together by Viala (29)."

Independent 20 percent increases in each variable gave, respectively, 8-, 1.2-, and 1.5-fold increases in the intensity, and 36, 1, and 4 percent increases in the mean energy of the x-rays."
