https://openalex.org/W2884595465,"A puzzle of new particles Atmospheric particulates can be produced by emissions or form de novo. New particle formation usually occurs in relatively clean air. This is because preexisting particles in the atmosphere will scavenge the precursors of new particles and suppress their formation. However, observations in some heavily polluted megacities have revealed substantial rates of new particle formation despite the heavy loads of ambient aerosols. Yao et al. investigated new particle formation in Shanghai and describe the conditions that make this process possible. The findings will help inform policy decisions about how to reduce air pollution in these types of environments. Science , this issue p. 278"

It has been suggested that coral reefs in deeper waters may provide a refuge less affected by human development and climate change. Rocha et al. , however, show that shallow and deep reefs are biologically different. Furthermore, deep (or mesophotic) reefs are also suffering from human impacts. Thus, deep reefs do not represent a potential refuge for other reef ecosystems. Indeed, they too are threatened and need protection. Science , this issue p. 281"

Skyrmions are one such topological entity, which resemble “hedgehog-like” structures. Tsesses et al. controlled the interference of plasmon polaritons on a patterned metallic surface to generate a lattice of optical skyrmions. Such control could potentially optically mimic complex condensed matter systems or help in the development of robust optical communications and circuits. Science , this issue p. 993"
https://openalex.org/W2883726874,"RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1) is a master regulator of signaling pathways leading to inflammation and cell death and is of medical interest as a drug target. We report four patients from three unrelated families with complete RIPK1 deficiency caused by rare homozygous mutations. The patients suffered from recurrent infections, early-onset inflammatory bowel disease, and progressive polyarthritis. They had immunodeficiency with lymphopenia and altered production of various cytokines revealed by whole-blood assays. In vitro, RIPK1-deficient cells showed impaired mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and cytokine secretion and were prone to necroptosis. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reversed cytokine production defects and resolved clinical symptoms in one patient. Thus, RIPK1 plays a critical role in the human immune system."

The 19 members of the Wnt family interact promiscuously with the 10 Frizzled receptors, raising the question of how ligand-specific discrimination is achieved in a biological context. Eubelen et al. used experiments in zebrafish to show that cells are equipped with decoding modules that bind Wnt with high specificity and trigger signal amplification via their recruitment into higher-order Frizzled signalosomes (see the Perspective by Kim and Goentoro). Thus, distinct Wnt ligand-receptor pairs can be targeted specifically for therapeutic purposes. Science , this issue p. eaat1178 ; see also p. 643"

VHL is a ubiquitin ligase that degrades target proteins when they are prolyl-hydroxylated. Zhang et al. performed a genome-wide search for VHL target (see the Perspective by Sanchez and Simon). They identified ZHX2, a protein with structural motifs that indicate DNA binding. ZHX2 has been implicated in tumor suppression. Loss of ZHX2 inhibited signaling through the transcription factor NF-κB, and ZHX2 bound to many NF-κB target genes. Depletion of ZHX2 slowed growth of ccRCC cells in vitro and in a mouse model.

Sickle cell disease is an inherited condition that involves abnormal hemoglobin. Current treatments entail modulating the level of fetal hemoglobin expression. Grevet et al. performed a CRISPR-Cas9 screen for regulators of fetal hemoglobin in RBCs and identified heme-regulated eIF2α kinase (HRI). Depleting the kinase in RBCs led to an increase in fetal hemoglobin levels and reduced sickling of cultured human RBCs. Thus, HRI may be a therapeutic target for sickle cell disease and other hemoglobin disorders. Science , this issue p. 285"
https://openalex.org/W3105274319,"Recent developments in the relationship between bulk topology and surface crystal symmetry have led to the discovery of materials whose gapless surface states are protected by crystal symmetries. In fact, there exists only a very limited set of possible surface crystal symmetries, captured by the 17 ""wallpaper groups."" We show that a consideration of symmetry-allowed band degeneracies in the wallpaper groups can be used to understand previous topological crystalline insulators, as well as to predict new examples. In particular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines, $pgg$ and $p4g$, allow for a new topological insulating phase, whose surface spectrum consists of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion. Like the surface state of a conventional topological insulator, the surface Dirac fermion in this ""nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator"" provides a theoretical exception to a fermion doubling theorem. Unlike the surface state of a conventional topological insulator, it can be gapped into topologically distinct surface regions while keeping time-reversal symmetry, allowing for networks of topological surface quantum spin Hall domain walls. We report the theoretical discovery of new topological crystalline phases in the A$_2$B$_3$ family of materials in SG 127, finding that Sr$_2$Pb$_3$ hosts this new topological surface Dirac fermion. Furthermore, (100)-strained Au$_2$Y$_3$ and Hg$_2$Sr$_3$ host related topological surface hourglass fermions. We also report the presence of this new topological hourglass phase in Ba$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ in SG 55. For orthorhombic space groups with two glides, we catalog all possible bulk topological phases by a consideration of the allowed non-abelian Wilson loop connectivities, and we develop topological invariants for these systems. Finally, we show how in a particular limit, these crystalline phases reduce to copies of the SSH model."
https://openalex.org/W2767326835,"Laser cooled and quantum degenerate atoms are widely being pursued as quantum simulators that may explain the behavior of strongly correlated material systems, and as the basis of today's most precise sensors. A key challenge towards these goals is to understand and control coherent interactions between the atoms. Here, we observe long-range exchange interactions mediated by an optical cavity, which manifest as tunable spin-spin interactions on the pseudo spin-1/2 system composed of the millihertz linewidth clock transition in strontium. We observe the so-called one axis twisting dynamics, the emergence of a many-body energy gap, and signatures of gap protection of the optical coherence against certain sources of decoherence. These effects manifest in the output of a pulsed, superradiant laser operating on the millihertz linewidth transition. Our observations will aid in the future design of versatile quantum simulators that take advantage of the unique control and probing capabilities of cavity QED and the rich internal structure of long-lived Sr atoms. They also open a route for the next generation of atomic clocks that utilize quantum correlations for enhanced metrology."

Rosenblum et al. used higher quantum states of a superconducting-based quantum circuit to demonstrate a method for the fault-tolerant measurement of an error-correctable logical qubit. Such fault-tolerant measurements will allow more frequent interrogations of the state of the logical qubit, ultimately leading to the implementation of more quantum operations and more complex entangled quantum circuits.

Lim et al. identified enzymes that can decorate poly(A) tails with non-A nucleotides. The noncanonical poly(A) polymerases, TENT4A and TENT4B, incorporate intermittent non-A residues (G, U, or C) with a preference for guanosine, which results in a heterogenous poly(A) tail. Deadenylases trim poly(A) tails to initiate mRNA degradation but stall at the non-A residues. In effect, the not-so-pure tail stabilizes mRNAs by slowing down deadenylation.

Pham et al. confined NbSe 3 within carbon nanotubes (a conductor) or boron nitride nanotubes (an insulator). Transmission electron microscopy revealed an oscillatory motion of the confined chains not observed in bulk crystals. Electronic structure calculations showed that charge transfer drives the torsional wave instability, and the limited covalent bonding between the chains and the nanotube sheath allows unhindered dynamics. Application of an external potential applied to the nanotube should directly affect the torsion and thus lead to different optical and electron transport properties. Science , this issue p. 263"

https://openalex.org/W2883864921,"Niche differentiation, the partitioning of resources along one or more axes of a species’ niche hyper-volume, is widely recognised as an important mechanism for sympatric species to reduce interspecific competition and predation risk, and thus facilitate co-existence. Resource partitioning may be facilitated by behavioural differentiation along three main niche dimensions: habitat, food and time. In this study, we investigate the extent to which these mechanisms can explain the coexistence of an assemblage of five sympatric felids in Borneo. Using multi-scale logistic regression, we show that Bornean felids exhibit differences in both their broad and fine-scale habitat use. We calculate temporal activity patterns and overlap between these species, and present evidence for temporal separation within this felid guild. Lastly, we conducted an all-subsets logistic regression to predict the occurrence of each felid species as a function of the co-occurrence of a large number of other species and showed that Bornean felids co-occurred with a range of other species, some of which could be candidate prey. Our study reveals apparent resource partitioning within the Bornean felid assemblage, operating along all three niche dimension axes. These results provide new insights into the ecology of these species and the broader community in which they live and also provide important information for conservation planning for this guild of predators."
https://openalex.org/W2883614304,"The homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) transcription factor family plays vital roles in plant development and morphogenesis as well as responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In barley, a recessive mutation in Vrs1 (HvHox1) changes two-rowed barley to six-rowed barley, which improves yield considerably. The Vrs1 gene encodes an HD-Zip subfamily I transcription factor. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the rice HD-Zip I genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 are the closest homologues of Vrs1. Here, we show that Oshox12 and Oshox14 are ubiquitously expressed with higher levels in developing panicles. Trans-activation assays in yeast and rice protoplasts demonstrated that Oshox12 and Oshox14 can bind to a specific DNA sequence, AH1 (CAAT(A/T)ATTG), and activate reporter gene expression. Overexpression of Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice resulted in reduced panicle length and a dwarf phenotype. In addition, Oshox14 overexpression lines showed a deficiency in panicle exsertion. Our findings suggest that Oshox12 and Oshox14 may be involved in the regulation of panicle development. This study provides a significant advancement in understanding the functions of HD-Zip transcription factors in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2884195218,"Purpose Empowerment in patients can lead to a higher participation in care and self-management skills. However, there are a limited number of high-quality instruments to assess empowerment and its various dimensions in young persons. The aim was to develop and assess the psychometric properties of the Gothenburg Young Persons Empowerment Scale (GYPES). Methods The GYPES is a 15-item questionnaire designed to measure patient empowerment in young persons with chronic conditions. Three studies were conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the scale. Studies I and II assessed face, content and factorial validity, as well as responsiveness and reliability in young persons with congenital heart disease and diabetes. After these studies problematic items were identified and reworded and the final version of the GYPES was tested in young persons with diabetes in study III. Results The content and face validity of the scale was confirmed in study I. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) in study II supported the five-factor structure of the GYPES. However, one item had a low factor loading. The scale was revised and evaluated in study III. CFA of this version supported adequate model fit with factor loadings ranging from 0.385–0.941. A second-order model had an adequate fit to the data. Cronbach’s alpha for the overall scale was 0.858 and for each subscale, alphas range from 0.609–0.858. Conclusions GYPES was developed to measure patient empowerment in young persons with chronic conditions. Preliminary evidence supports that the GYPES may be a valid and reliable tool for assessing young persons’ empowerment."

Such tools should integrate the complexity of the ecosystem and enable exploration of different natural and anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, eutrophication and fishing pressures in order to compare alternative management strategies. We present a new framework, with a Baltic implementation of the spatially-explicit end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model linked to two external models, to explore the different pressures on the marine ecosystem. The HBM-ERGOM initializes the Atlantis model with high-resolution physical-chemical-biological and hydrodynamic information while the FISHRENT model analyses the fisheries economics of the output of commercial fish biomass for the Atlantis terminal projection year. The Baltic Atlantis model composes 29 sub-areas, 9 vertical layers and 30 biological functional groups. The balanced calibration provides realistic levels of biomass for, among others, known stock sizes of top predators and of key fish species. Furthermore, it gives realistic levels of phytoplankton biomass and shows reasonable diet compositions and geographical distribution patterns for the functional groups. By simulating several scenarios of nutrient load reductions on the ecosystem and testing sensitivity to different fishing pressures, we show that the model is sensitive to those changes and capable of evaluating the impacts on different trophic levels, fish stocks, and fisheries associated with changed benthic oxygen conditions. We conclude that the Baltic Atlantis forms an initial basis for strategic management evaluation suited for conducting medium to long term ecosystem assessments which are of importance for a number of pan-Baltic stakeholders in relation to anthropogenic pressures such as eutrophication, climate change and fishing pressure, as well as changed biological interactions between functional groups."
https://openalex.org/W2883446651,"Adipose tissue stores energy and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is an important early transcription factor for 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation, facilitating mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) and transactivating C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) to promote adipogenesis. C/EBPβ is induced early, but the expression of antimitotic C/EBPα and PPARγ is not induced until ∼48 h. The delayed expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ is thought to ensure MCE progression, but the molecular mechanism for this delay remains elusive. Here, we show that the zinc-finger transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 10 (KLF10) is induced after adipogenic induction and that its expression positively correlates with that of C/EBPβ but inversely correlates with expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ. C/EBPβ bound to the KLF10 promoter and transactivated its expression during MCE. KLF10 overexpression in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte repressed adipogenesis and decreased C/EBPα and PPARγ expression, whereas siRNA-mediated down-regulation of KLF10 enhanced adipogenesis and increased C/EBPα and PPARγ expression. Luciferase assays revealed an inhibitory effect of KLF10 on C/EBPα promoter activity. Using promoter deletion and mutation analysis, we identified a KLF10-binding site within the proximal promoter region of C/EBPα. Furthermore, KLF10 interacted with and recruited histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the C/EBPα promoter, decreasing acetylated histone H4 on the C/EBPα promoter and inactivating C/EBPα transcription. Because C/EBPα can transactivate PPARγ, our results suggest a mechanism by which expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ is delayed via KLF10 expression and shed light on the negative feedback loop for C/EBPβ-regulated adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte.

https://openalex.org/W2952889429,"Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted glycoprotein and the only member of the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family that converts lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA controls key responses, such as cell migration, proliferation, and survival, implicating ATX-LPA signaling in various (patho)physiological processes and establishing it as a drug target. ATX structural and functional studies have revealed an orthosteric and an allosteric site, called the pocket and the tunnel, respectively. However, the mechanisms in allosteric modulation of ATX's activity as a lysophospholipase D are unclear. Here, using the physiological LPC substrate, a new fluorescent substrate, and diverse ATX inhibitors, we revisited the kinetics and allosteric regulation of the ATX catalytic cycle, dissecting the different steps and pathways leading to LPC hydrolysis. We found that ATX activity is stimulated by LPA and that LPA activates ATX lysophospholipase D activity by binding to the ATX tunnel. A consolidation of all experimental kinetics data yielded a comprehensive catalytic model supported by molecular modeling simulations and suggested a positive feedback mechanism that is regulated by the abundance of the LPA products activating hydrolysis of different LPC species. Our results complement and extend the current understanding of ATX hydrolysis in light of the allosteric regulation by ATX-produced LPA species and have implications for the design and application of both orthosteric and allosteric ATX inhibitors."

Although IBD can affect any breed, German shepherd dogs (GSD) in the UK are at increased risk of developing the disease. Based on previous evidence, the aim of the present study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which may confer genetic susceptibility or resistance to IBD using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA blood or saliva samples of 96 cases and 98 controls. Genotyping of cases and controls was performed on the Canine Illumina HD SNP array and data generated was analyzed using PLINK. Several SNPs and regions on chromosomes 7,9,11 and 13 were detected to be associated with IBD using different SNP-by-SNP association methods and FST windows approach. Searching one Mb up-and down-stream of the most significant SNPs, as identified by single SNP analysis as well as 200Kb before and after the start and the end position of the associated regions identified by FST windows approach, we identified 63 genes. Using a combination of pathways analysis and a list of genes that have been reported to be involved in human IBD, we identified 16 candidate genes potentially associated with IBD in GSD."

Mutations in human lipin 1 are a common cause of recurrent rhabdomyolysis in children. Mice with constitutive whole-body lipin 1 deficiency have been used to examine mechanisms connecting lipin 1 deficiency to myocyte injury. However, that mouse model is confounded by lipodystrophy not phenocopied in people. Herein, 2 muscle-specific mouse models were studied: 1) Lpin1 exon 3 and 4 deletion, resulting in a hypomorphic protein without PAP activity, but which preserved transcriptional coregulatory function; and 2) Lpin1 exon 7 deletion, resulting in total protein loss. In both models, skeletal muscles exhibited a chronic myopathy with ongoing muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration and accumulation of phosphatidic acid and, paradoxically, diacylglycerol. Additionally, lipin 1-deficient mice had abundant, but abnormal, mitochondria likely because of impaired autophagy. Finally, these mice exhibited increased plasma creatine kinase following exhaustive exercise when unfed. These data suggest that mice lacking lipin 1-mediated PAP activity in skeletal muscle may serve as a model for determining the mechanisms by which lipin 1 deficiency leads to myocyte injury and for testing potential therapeutic approaches.-Schweitzer, G.

https://openalex.org/W2883601587,"Background Modern energy enables health service delivery. Access to electricity is, however, unreliable in many health facilities in developing countries. Little research has explored the relationships between energy and service delivery. Methods Based on extensive literature searches and iterative discussions within the research team, we first develop a conceptual framework of the role of energy in health facilities. We then use this framework to explore how characteristics of electricity supply affect distinct energy uses in health facilities (e.g. lighting), and how functional or non-functional lighting affects the provision of night-time care services in Malawi. To do so we apply descriptive statistics and conduct logistic and multinomial regressions using data from the Service Provision Assessment (SPA) of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for all health facilities in Malawi in 2013/2014. Results The conceptual framework depicts the pathways from different energy types and their characteristics, through to distinct energy uses in health facilities (e.g. medical devices) and health-relevant service outputs (e.g. safe medical equipment). These outputs can improve outcomes for patients (e.g. infection control), facilities (e.g. efficiency) and staff (e.g. working conditions) at facilities level and, ultimately, contribute to better population health outcomes. Our exploratory analysis suggests that energy uses were less likely to be functional in facilities with lower-quality electricity supply. Descriptive statistics revealed a critical lack of functional lighting in facilities offering child delivery and night-time care; surprisingly, the provision of night-time care was not associated with whether facilities had functional lighting. Overall, the DHS SPA dataset is not well-suited for assessing the relationships depicted within the framework. Conclusion The framework conceptualizes the role of energy in health facilities in a comprehensive manner. Over time, it should be empirically validated through a combination of different research approaches, including tracking of indicators, detailed energy audits, qualitative and intervention studies."

Given the importance of understanding interdependence in substance use during adolescence, the purpose of this study is to examine the co-evolution of cigarette smoking, alcohol, and marijuana use within the ever-changing landscape of adolescent friendship networks, which are a primary socialization context for adolescent substance use. Utilizing Stochastic Actor-Based models, we examine how multiple simultaneous social processes co-evolve with adolescent smoking, drinking, and marijuana use within adolescent friendship networks using two school samples from early waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). We also estimate two separate models examining the effects from using one substance to the initiation and cessation of other substances for each sample. Based on the initial model results, we simulate the model forward in time by turning off one key effect in the estimated model at a time, and observe how the distribution of use of each substance changes. We find evidence of a unilateral causal relationship from marijuana use to subsequent smoking and drinking behaviors, resulting in the initiation of drinking behavior. Marijuana use is also associated with smoking initiation in a school with a low substance use level, and smoking cessation in a school with a high substance use level. In addition, in a simulation model excluding the effect from marijuana use to smoking and drinking behavior, the number of smokers and drinkers decreases precipitously. Overall, our findings indicate some evidence of sequential drug use, as marijuana use increased subsequent smoking and drinking behavior and indicate that an adolescent's level of marijuana use affects the initiation and continuation of smoking and drinking."
https://openalex.org/W2884565788,"The spatiotemporal distribution of resources is a critical component of realized animal distributions. In agricultural landscapes, space use by generalist consumers is influenced by ephemeral resource availability that may produce behavioral differences across agricultural seasons, resulting in economic and production consequences and increased human-wildlife conflict. Our objective was to assess changes in habitat selection across seasons in an invasive generalist omnivore (feral pigs, Sus scrofa). Hypothesizing that pig space use is primarily driven by forage availability, we predicted strong selection for the most nutritionally beneficial crops and resource types as agricultural seasons progressed. We deployed GPS collars on 13 adult feral pigs in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley to study resource selection in a fragmented agricultural landscape. We estimated resource selection using mixed-effect logistic regression to assess variation in selection across planting, growing, harvest, and fallow seasons.We found that feral pigs varied resource selection across seasons, particularly for corn (Zea mais). We also detected seasonal dependencies in proportional coverage on the net probability of selection of a land unit (e.g., selection was generally strongest for locations composed of both agricultural and natural habitat), resulting in marked variation in predicted space use among agricultural seasons.These findings indicate behavioral changes in selection across agricultural seasons are driven by complex interactions between the availabilities of temporally dynamic resources and temporally static natural cover. Temporal variations in resource selection trends indicate seasonal responses to crop phenology which suggests a season-specific habitat functional response."
https://openalex.org/W2883780548,"Numerous studies have provided experience-based or theory-based frameworks for the basis of judgment of learning (JOL). However, few studies have directly measured processing experience and beliefs related to the same cue in one experiment and examined their joint contribution to JOLs. The present study focused on font-size effects and aimed to examine the simultaneous contribution of processing fluency and beliefs to the effect of font size on JOLs. We directly measured processing fluency via self-paced study time. We also directly measured participants’ beliefs via two approaches: pre-study global differentiated predictions (GPREDs) as an indicator of preexisting beliefs about font size and memory and ease of learning judgments (EORs) as online generated item-specific beliefs about fluency. In Experiment 1, EORs partially mediated the font-size effect, whereas self-paced study time did not. In Experiments 2a and 2b, EORs mediated the font-size effect; at the same time, beliefs about font size and memory moderated the font-size effect. In summary, the present study demonstrates a major role of beliefs underlying the font-size effect."

Yet, molecular analyses have yet to be extensively applied to complement the rich history of electrophysiological study that this animal has received. Here, we generated the first de novo transcriptome assembly from the entire central nervous system of Hirudo verbana, with the goal of providing a molecular resource, as well as to lay the foundation for a comprehensive discovery of genes fundamentally important for neural function. Our assembly generated 107,704 contigs from over 900 million raw reads. Of these 107,704 contigs, 39,047 (36%) were annotated using NCBI's validated RefSeq sequence database. From this annotated central nervous system transcriptome, we began the process of curating genes related to nervous system function by identifying and characterizing 126 unique ion channel, receptor, transporter, and enzyme contigs. Additionally, we generated sequence counts to estimate the relative abundance of each identified ion channel and receptor contig in the transcriptome through Kallisto mapping.

https://openalex.org/W2884150929,"The diseases caused by Salmonella Gallinarum and S. Pullorum in chickens known as fowl typhoid and pullorum disease, respectively, pose a great threat to the poultry industry mainly in developing countries, since they have already been controlled in the developed ones. These bacteria are very similar at the genomic level but develop distinct host-pathogen relationships with chickens. Therefore, a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms whereby S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum interact with the host could lead to the development of new approaches to control and, perhaps, eradicate both diseases from the chicken flocks worldwide. Based on our previous study, it was hypothesised that metabolism-related pseudogenes, fixed in S. Pullorum genomes, could play a role in the distinct host-pathogen interaction with susceptible chickens. To test this idea, three genes (idnT, idnO and ccmH) of S. Gallinarum str. 287/91, which are pseudogenes on the S. Pullorum chromosomes, were inactivated by mutations. These genetically engineered strains grew well on the solid media without any colony morphology difference. In addition, similar growth curves were obtained by cultivation in M9 minimal medium containing D-gluconate as the sole carbon source. Infection of chickens with idnTO mutants led to increased numbers of bacteria in the livers and spleens at 5 days post-infection, but with slightly decreased heterophil infiltration in the spleens when compared to the wild-type strain. On the other hand, no significant phenotypic change was caused by mutation to ccmH genes. Apart from the above-mentioned alterations, all S. Gallinarum strains provoked similar infections, since mortality, clinical signs, macroscopic alterations and immune response were similar to the infected chickens. Therefore, according to the model applied to this study, mutation to the idnTO and ccmH genes showed minor impact on the fowl typhoid pathogenesis and so they may be relics from the ancestor genome. Our data hints at a more complex mechanism driving the distinct host-pathogen interaction of S. Gallinarum/Pullorum with chickens than differential inactivation of a few genes."
https://openalex.org/W2884391765,"An ongoing study of the genus Merodon Meigen, 1803 in the Republic of South Africa (RSA) has revealed the existence of new species related to M. melanocerus Bezzi, 1915. The M. melanocerus subgroup belongs to the Afrotropical lineage of the M. desuturinus group. Revision of all available material from museums and detailed analyses of newly -collected specimens from our own expeditions to RSA resulted in delimitation of five species: M. capensis Hurkmans sp. n., M. commutabilis Radenković et Vujić sp. n., M. drakonis Vujić et Radenković sp. n., M. flavocerus Hurkmans sp. n. and M. melanocerus. In addition to classical morphological characters, sequences of the mitochondrial COI gene are provided for four related taxa. Results of molecular phylogenetic analyses supports monophyly of the M. desuturinus group and confirmed delimitation between species. Links between Palaearctic and Afrotropical faunas of this group, as well as possible evolutionary paths, are discussed. Based on phylogenetic analyses, four lineages (putative subgenera) have been recognized within the genus Merodon; besides the three previously established ones, albifrons+desuturinus, aureus (sensu lato) and avidus-nigritarsis, one new lineage named natans is distinguished."
https://openalex.org/W2883478812,"The role of molecular changes in the androgen receptor (AR) as AR variants (AR-Vs) is not clear in the pathophysiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and hormone-naïve PCa. The aim of the current work was to identify the presence of AR isoforms in benign tissue and primary PCa, and to evaluate the possible association with tumor aggressiveness and biochemical recurrence in primary PCa. The mRNA levels of full length AR (AR-FL) and AR-Vs (AR-V1, AR-V4 and AR-V7) were measured using RT-qPCR. The protein expression of AR-FL (AR-CTD and AR-NTD) and AR-V7 were evaluated by the H-Score in immunohistochemistry (IHC). All investigated mRNA targets were expressed both in BPH and PCa. AR-FL mRNA levels were similar in both groups. AR-V4 mRNA expression showed higher levels in BPH, and AR-V1 and AR-V7 mRNA expression were higher in PCa. The AR-V7 protein showed a similar H-Score in both groups, while AR-CTD and AR-NTD were higher in nuclei of epithelial cells from BPH. These results support the assumption that these constitutively active isoforms of AR are involved in the pathophysiology of primary PCa and BPH. The role of AR-Vs and their possible modulation by steroid tissue levels in distinct types of prostate tumors needs to be elucidated to help guide the best clinical management of these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2883521803,"Social knowledge refers to the ability to analyze and reason about social situations in relation to social rules which are essential to the development of social skills and social behavior. The present research aimed to assess these abilities with the ""Social resolution task"" in a neurotypical population of 351 children (4 to 12 years) and 39 young adults, and in 20 participants (10 to 18 years) with Down syndrome. Results showed that young children aged 4 to 6 were well able to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate social behavior but they had significantly more difficulties in judging and identifying social cues for the transgression of conventional rules than for moral ones. Between age 4 and 8, their social reasoning was mainly based on factual answers, while older children showed significantly more social awareness, making more reference to emotional and social consequences for the ""victims"". The representation of a more universal applicability of social rules seemed to develop later in childhood, as of age 8. In contrast, participants with Down syndrome exhibited significantly more difficulties in judging, identifying and reasoning about transgression of social rules without social awareness. In conclusion, the results have shown that social reasoning abilities develop throughout childhood. Social awareness seems to have a long developmental course, which includes a sensibility about welfare and intersubjectivity, critical for the development of prosocial behavior. The clinical population with difficulties in social interaction and socio-emotional behavior could benefit from an early assessment and from learning social reasoning abilities to improve social skills."
https://openalex.org/W2884195920,"Carbon nanotubes have attracted increasing attention attributable to their widespread application. To evaluate the joint toxicity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and nonylphenol (NP), we investigated the toxicological effects of NP, pristine MWCNTs, and MWCNTs combined with NP in male mice. After exposing male mice by gavage for 5 days, intracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels in tissues were determined to evaluate in vivo oxidative stress. In addition, genotoxicity was assessed by examining DNA damage in mouse liver and sperm via the comet assay, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for direct visual observations of mitochondrial damage in the liver. Results from the oxidative damage and DNA damage experiments indicate that after adsorbing NP, MWCNTs at a high dose induce oxidative lesions in the liver and cause DNA damage in mouse sperm; these data offer new insights regarding the toxicological assessment of MWCNTs."
https://openalex.org/W2884872269,"The TLO genes are a family of subtelomeric ORFs in the fungal pathogens Candida albicans and C. dubliniensis encoding a subunit of the Mediator complex homologous to Med2. The more virulent pathogen C. albicans has 15 copies of the gene whereas the less pathogenic species C. dubliniensis has only two. To investigate if expansion of the TLO repertoire in C. dubliniensis has an effect on phenotype and virulence we expressed three representative C. albicans TLO genes (TLOβ2, TLOγ11 and TLOα12) in a wild type C. dubliniensis background, under the control of either their native or the ACT1 promoter. Expression of TLOβ2 resulted in a hyperfilamentous phenotype, while overexpression of TLOγ11 and TLOα12 resulted in enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. Expression of all three TLO genes from the ACT1 promoter resulted in increased virulence in the Galleria infection model. In order to further investigate if individual TLO genes exhibit differences in function we expressed six representative C. albicans TLO genes in a C. dubliniensis Δtlo1/Δtlo2 double mutant. Differences were observed in the ability of the expressed CaTLOs to complement the various phenotypes of the mutant. All TLO genes with the exception of TLOγ7 could restore filamentation, however only TLOα9, γ11 and α12 could restore chlamydospore formation. Differences in the ability of CaTLO genes to restore growth in the presence of H2O2, calcofluor white, Congo red and at 42°C were observed. Only TLOα3 restored wild-type levels of virulence in the Galleria infection model. These data show that expansion of the TLO gene family in C. dubliniensis results in gain of function and that there is functional diversity amongst members of the gene family. We propose that this expansion of the TLO family contributes to the success of C. albicans as a commensal and opportunistic pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2884786236,"Objective The purpose of this paper is to describe current practices of medical waste management, including its generation, investments, collection, storage, segregation, and disposal, and to explore the level of support from upper tiers of the government and health care system for medical waste management in rural China. Methods The authors draw on a dataset comprised of 209 randomly selected rural township health centers (THCs) in 21 counties in three provinces of China: Anhui, Shaanxi and Sichuan. Surveys were administered to health center administrators in sample THCs in June 2015. Results The results show that the generation rate of medical waste was about 0.18 kg/bed, 0.15 kg/patient, or 0.13 kg/person per day on average. Such per capita levels are significant given China’s large rural population. Although investments of medical waste facilities and personnel in THCs have improved, results show that compliance with national regulations is low. For example, less than half of hazardous medical waste was packed in sealed containers or containers labeled with bio-hazard markings. None of the THCs segregated correctly according to the categories required by formal Chinese regulations. Many THCs reported improper disposal methods of medical waste. Our results also indicate low levels of staff training and low rates of centralized disposal in rural THCs. Conclusions Medical waste is a serious environmental issue that is rising on the agenda of policymakers. While a large share of THCs has invested in medical waste facilities and personnel, it appears that actual compliance remains low. Using evidence of low rates of training and centralized disposal, we surmise that a lack of support from upper tiers of management is one contributing factor. Given these findings, we recommend that China’s policymakers should enhance support from upper tiers and improve monitoring as well as incentives in order to improve medical waste management."

Finally, the JIP1 binding to kinesin1 can favor or prevent the binding of other protein cargos, such as JIP3/4 (JNK-interacting proteins 3 and 4, which are structurally unrelated to JIP1/2) (9Hammond J.W.

Kinesin1 is able to transport various cargos, like vesicles, organelles, or macromolecular assemblies, along microtubules (13Morfini G. Schmidt N. Weissmann C. Pigino G. Kins S. Conventional kinesin: biochemical heterogeneity and functional implications in health and disease.Brain Res.

It functions as a heterotetramer composed of a homodimer of kinesin heavy chains (KHC) bound to two kinesin light chains (KLC). KHC consists of three parts: an N-terminal globular motor domain (head) that contains the ATP and microtubule binding sites, a central elongated coiled-coil (stalk) responsible for dimerization, and a C-terminal unstructured region (tail) that regulates motor motility and recruits cargos. KLC is composed of three parts: an N-terminal heptad repeat region that binds to the KHC stalk, a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain involved in cargo recruitment, and a variable C-terminal region. Within the flexible linker between the heptad repeat region and the TPR domain of KLC, there is a highly conserved leucine-phenylalanine-proline motif flanked by acidic residues (LFP-acidic motif) that can act like an autoinhibitory motif by folding back on the TPR domain to prevent cargo binding (14Yip Y.Y. Pernigo S. Sanger A. Xu M. Parsons M. Steiner R.A. Dodding M.P. The light chains of kinesin-1 are autoinhibited.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2016; 113 (26884162): 2418-242310.1073/pnas.1520817113Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The TPR domain of KLC consists of six TPR motifs (TPR1–6) with a non-TPR region of 40 residues inserted between the TPR5 and TPR6 motifs. Each motif repeat, involving two antiparallel α helices (A and B), stacks together in a parallel array to form an extended molecule with an overall right-handed superhelical architecture. The TPR domain adopts a cradle shape with helices A of each repeat lining the concave face (or groove) and helices B lining the convex face. In vertebrates, four KLC isoforms (KLC1–4) are identified, and crystal structures of two of these isoforms were determined. Thus, crystal structures of KLC1 and KLC2 showed that the TPR domain adopts a classical TPR fold consisting of 12 helices with the partially flexible non-TPR region extruding from the convex side at the C-terminal part of the TPR domain (15Zhu H.

Interestingly, the groove of KLC1 and KLC2 is composed of numerous asparagine and basic residues that allow binding of short and acidic segment sequences like those of the LFP-acidic autoinhibitory motif or protein cargos, such as ALCα, TorsinA, or JIP1. Several experiments were reported concerning the JIP1 recruitment by KLC1. On one side, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the extreme C terminus of JIP1 (JIP1-Cter, -TCPTEDIYLECOOH sequence) is required to bind to the TPR domain of KLC1, and the tyrosine residue (Tyr709) at position −3 from the end is critical for this interaction (6Verhey K.J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152 (11238452): 959-97010.1083/jcb.152.5.959Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Also, the last glutamic acidic residue (Glu711) of JIP1 was shown to be critical for KLC1 binding in vitro (15Zhu H. Lee H.Y. Tong Y. Hong B.-S. Kim K.-P. Shen Y. Lim K.J. Mackenzie F. Tempel W. Park H.-W.

On the other side, in vitro binding assays reported that JIP1 does not interact with KLC2 and is thus a specific cargo for KLC1 with the Asn343, located in the TPR groove of KLC1 responsible for this specificity (15Zhu H. Lee H.Y. Tong Y. Hong B.-S. Kim K.-P. Shen Y. Lim K.J. Mackenzie F. Tempel W. Park H.-W.

Despite there being no experimental information available concerning the specificity of KLC3 and KLC4 for JIP1, they share with KLC1 an asparagine residue at this determinant position, indicating that KLC3 and KLC4 probably recruit JIP1. Further, directed yeast two-hybrid investigations reveal that multiple mutations into the TPR groove of KLC1, especially on asparagine residues, abolished JIP1 binding (9Hammond J.W. Griffin K. Jih G.T. Stuckey J. Verhey K.J. Co-operative versus independent transport of different cargoes by kinesin-1.Traffic. 2008; 9 (18266909): 725-74110.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00722.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data reveal that the extreme C terminus of JIP1 binds into the groove of the TPR domain, but the details of this interaction are not yet elucidated. Interestingly, JIP1 competes with ALCα for kinesin1 transport, revealing that kinesin1 cannot recruit at the same time JIP1 and ALCα. ALCα, as well as the lysosome adaptor SKIP (SifA-kinesin–interacting protein) belong to a kinesin1 cargo family that is recruited by KLC1/2 through a bipartite tryptophan-based binding motif flanked by acidic residues (W-acidic motif) (10Konecna A.

However, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments reveal that the determinant Asn343 of KLC1, which is critical for JIP1 interaction, is not involved in ALCα binding (15Zhu H. Lee H.Y.

Further, Dodding and co-workers (14Yip Y.Y. Pernigo S. Sanger A. Xu M. Parsons M. Steiner R.A. Dodding M.P. The light chains of kinesin-1 are autoinhibited.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Altogether, these observations suggest that despite the mode of binding of JIP1 and W-acidic cargos with KLC sharing similarities, the details of their interactions are distinct. To characterize the JIP1-binding site on the TPR domain of KLC1, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) binding assays between various truncated fragments as well as mutants of the TPR domain of KLC1 and a peptide covering the last 10 residues of JIP1 (C10). Sequence search in eukaryotic genomes identified the mouse SH2D6 protein, which exhibits a consensus motif that is very similar to the KLC1-binding motif of JIP1; microscale thermophoresis (MST) binding assays were also conducted to characterize this potential interaction. By comparing with available crystal structures of KLC1-TPR complexes, our biochemical data allow us to discuss the structural basis of the marginal inhibition of the LFP-acidic motif for JIP1 binding to KLC-TPR as well as the competition between JIP1 and W-acidic motif cargo binding. During the revision of this manuscript, the crystal structure of KLC1-TPR bound to JIP1 was released. Thus, in light of this new 3D structure, we discussed the role of each of the critical residues of KLC1-TPR for JIP1 binding identified here. The multiple-sequence alignment of full-length homologs of JIP1 and JIP2 shows that JIP1/2-like homologs can be found in several clades of metazoans, including insects and nematodes. In invertebrates, a single homolog of JIP1/2 was found, hereafter referred to as JIP1-like. The first duplication giving rise to the two JIP1/2 subfamilies can be positioned at the origin of the vertebrate clade because a single version of the protein is found in species closely related to vertebrates such as lancelets (Branchiostoma floridae) and tunicates (Ciona intestinalis). The extreme C terminus covering the KLC1-binding motif is very well conserved in evolution in all species. Fig. S1 shows a phylogenetic tree for JIP1 and JIP2 homologs as well as a multiple-sequence alignment of the extreme C terminus containing the KLC1-binding motif of JIP1/2 homologs. In vertebrates, the sequence of the extreme 10 last residues of JIP1/2 is highly conserved, and the consensus sequence is (T/A)CPTED(I/M)YLECOOH. Thus, the critical tyrosine is flanked by isoleucine (or methionine) and leucine residues, forming a hydrophobic triplet. The hydrophobic triplet is surrounded by three acidic residues, a glutamate and an aspartate residue before and a glutamate after. Also, because the JIP1-Cter motif is found at the extreme C terminus of JIP1, the C-terminal carboxylate represents a fourth negative charge. Finally, before the hydrophobic acidic sequence, three other conserved residues are found, cysteine, proline, and threonine. To identify proteins exhibiting a similar motif as the KLC1-binding motif of JIP1/2, we searched the consensus motif (E/D)(E/D)(I/M/L/V)Y(I/M/L/V)(E/D) against the UniProtKB database using the ScanProsite (21de Castro E. Sigrist C.J.A. Gattiker A. Bulliard V. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Hulo N. ScanProsite: detection of PROSITE signature matches and ProRule-associated functional and structural residues in proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 (16845026): W362-W36510.1093/nar/gkl124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) tool. We first filtered the 599 identified motifs (in 598 sequences) by eliminating noneukaryotic sequences and keeping a single isoform per protein, which left 193 motifs (in 192 sequences) for further analysis. Interestingly, none of the proteins identified exhibit the potential KLC1-binding motif at the extreme C terminus, except JIP1/2. We then filtered this list by removing all groups of proteins for which the potential KLC1-binding motif is found mainly in a region with predicted secondary structure. Indeed, the KLC1-binding motif in JIP1 is found in an unstructured region that is certainly a prerequisite to bind into the TPR domain groove. Finally, nonmammalian sequences were filtered out for final analysis. Thus, only 16 groups (among which were six groups with at least two proteins and 10 singletons) of proteins were identified in addition to the JIP1 and JIP2 homologs (Table S1), among which the group with the highest number of proteins (22 proteins) consists of the α-subunit of the sodium/potassium voltage-gated channel proteins, whereas the group that shares the highest conservation with the KLC1-binding motif of JIP1/2 (strictly identical on the positions that define the search consensus motif) consists of a single protein: the mouse SH2 domain-containing protein 6 (SH2D6). Also, referred to as SLNK, SH2D6 is an SH2 domain–containing adaptor molecule identified as an ortholog of SLP76 (also known as LCP2; see the hOPMAP web server (22Dey G. Jaimovich A. Collins S.R. Seki A. Meyer T. Systematic discovery of human gene function and principles of modular organization through phylogenetic profiling.Cell Rep. 2015; 10 (25683721): 993-100610.1016/j.celrep.2015.01.025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)), which is essential for signaling downstream of integrin and receptors containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (23Koretzky G.A. Abtahian F. Silverman M.A. SLP76 and SLP65: complex regulation of signalling in lymphocytes and beyond.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6 (16493428): 67-7810.1038/nri1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The potential KLC1-binding motif of mouse SH2D6 (accession number Q9D413) is located in the unstructured N-terminal half part surrounded by proline residues, allowing its potential interaction into the TPR domain groove of KLC1. A multiple-sequence alignment of SH2D6 homologs for the region containing the potential KLC1-binding motif is shown in Fig. S2. In vertebrates, the consensus sequence of the motif in SH2D6 is (E/N)(D/N/G/S)(L/I/V/T)Y(L/V)(E/Q), which is well conserved, although less than in JIP1/2. Beyond the consensus motif, differences are, however, observed between JIP1 and SH2D6. In SH2D6, three acidic residues are found before the hydrophobic triplet in place of two in JIP1/2. In addition, a conserved two-basic residue (KK) patch is found at the N terminus of the consensus motif, whereas no basic residue is identified in JIP1/2 (Fig. S1). And finally, because the consensus motif in SH2D6 is located in the internal part of the protein, there is no C-terminal carboxylate at the end of the motif. Altogether, this search highlights that a consensus motif similar to the KLC1-binding motif of JIP1/2 can be found in the unstructured internal parts of other proteins. However, biochemical analysis is required to validate these potential candidates as KLC1-binding partners. Using ITC, we characterized the interaction between the complete TPR domain of KLC1 (ranging from the first helix (A1) of the TPR1 motif to the last helix (B6) of the TPR6 motif; called hereafter fragment [A1-B6]; Table S2) and peptides covering the last 10 residues of human JIP1 (called hereafter C10; sequence Ac-TCPTEDIYLECOOH; Table S3). ITC data gave a dissociation constant (Kd) of 5.0 ± 0.5 μm for this reference measurement (Table 1 and Fig. 1A) that is in accordance with previously reported values (14Yip Y.Y. Pernigo S. Sanger A. Xu M. Parsons M. Steiner R.A. Dodding M.P. The light chains of kinesin-1 are autoinhibited.Proc. Natl. Acad.

The stoichiometry determined is N = 0.85 ± 0.01, close to 1, corresponding to one JIP1-C10 peptide bound to one KLC1-TPR molecule. This reference measurement was performed independently several times (n = 7), which shows that the dissociation constant ranges from 2.5 ± 0.4 to 8.3 ± 0.6 μm (mean ± S.D. of 5.8 ± 0.7 μm; Table S4), revealing an experimental 2-fold factor variation in Kd. Thermodynamic parameters exhibit negative enthalpy change and negative entropy contribution, supporting favorable hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Further, measurements performed at variable ionic strengths showed the strong impact of salt concentration on the binding affinity (from 5 to 106 μm, respectively, for NaCl concentration ranging from 150 to 500 mm; Fig. 1B), revealing that electrostatics also play an important role in the interaction process. Altogether, these observations are in accordance with the presence of hydrophobic and acidic residues in the KLC1-binding motif of JIP1.Table 1Thermodynamic parameters of the ITC experiments between various KLC1-TPR fragments and mutants and JIP1-C10 peptidesa Values were determined from fits of the ITC profile using the single-binding site model.b Kd was determined from Ka derived from fits of the ITC profile using the single-binding site model.

https://openalex.org/W2883690547,"This study sought to assess the reliability and comparability of two custom-built isokinetic dynamometers (Model A and Model B) with the gold-standard (Humac Norm). The two custom-built dynamometers consisted of commercially available leg extension machines attached to a robotically controlled resistance device (1080 Quantum), able to measure power, force and velocity outputs. Twenty subjects (14m/6f, 26±4.8yr, 176±7cm, 74.4±12.4kg) performed concentric leg extensions on the custom-built dynamometers and the Humac Norm. Fifteen maximal leg extensions were performed with each leg at 180° s-1, or the linear equivalent (~0.5m s-1). Peak power (W), mean power (W), and fatigue indexes (%) achieved on all three devices were compared. Both custom-built dynamometers revealed high reliability for peak and mean power on repeated tests (ICC>0.88). Coefficient of variation (CV) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were small when comparing power outputs obtained using Model A and the Humac Norm ([Formula: see text] CV = 9.0%, [Formula: see text] SEM = 49W; peak CV = 8.4%, peak SEM = 49W). Whereas, Model B had greater variance ([Formula: see text] CV = 13.3% [Formula: see text] SEM = 120W; peak CV = 14.7%, peak SEM = 146W). The custom-built dynamometers are capable of highly reliable measures, but absolute power outputs varied depending on the leg extension model. Consistent use of a single model offers reliable results for tracking muscular performance over time or testing an intervention."

The Si substrate of a fabricated Si-substrate-based silicon nitride (Si3N4) membrane was replaced with a polymer substrate. As such, laser machining was used to make a micro-size hole through the polyimide (PI) substrate, and a thin Si3N4 membrane was then transferred onto the PI substrate. Finally, a nanopore was formed in the membrane using a transmission electron microscope for detection of biomolecules. Compared to the Si-substrate-based device, the dielectric noise was greatly reduced and the root-mean-square noise level was decreased from 146.7 to 5.4 pA. Using this device, the translocation of double-strand deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected with a high signal/noise (S/N) ratio. This type of device is anticipated to be available for future versatile sequencing technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2884079584,"Since microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) have been implicated in oncogenesis, many of them have been identified as therapeutic targets. Previously we have demonstrated that miRNA-10b acts as a master regulator of the viability of metastatic tumor cells and represents a target for therapeutic intervention. We designed and synthesized an inhibitor of miR-10b, termed MN-anti-miR10b. We showed that treatment with MN-anti-miR10b led to durable regression/elimination of established metastases in murine models of metastatic breast cancer. Since miRNA-10b has been associated with various metastatic and non-metastatic cancers, in the present study, we investigated the effect of MN-anti-miR10b in a panel of over 600 cell lines derived from a variety of human malignancies. We observed an effect on the viability of multiple cell lines within each cancer type and a mostly dichotomous response with cell lines either strongly responsive to MN-anti-miR10b or not at all even at maximum dose tested, suggesting a very high specificity of the effect. Genomic modeling of the drug response showed enrichment of genes associated with the proto-oncogene, c-Jun."
https://openalex.org/W2951520458,"The GABA-gated chloride channels of the Cys-loop receptor family, known as GABAA receptors, function as the primary gatekeepers of fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Formed by the pentameric arrangement of five identical or homologous subunits, GABAA receptor subtypes are defined by the subunit composition that shape ion channel properties. An understanding of the structural basis of distinct receptor properties has been hindered by the absence of high resolution structural information for heteromeric assemblies. Robust heterologous expression and purification protocols of high expressing receptor constructs are vital for structural studies. Here, we describe a unique approach to screen for well-behaving and functional GABAA receptor subunit assemblies by using the Xenopus oocyte as an expression host in combination with fluorescence detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC). To detect receptor expression, GFP fusions were introduced into the α1 subunit isoform. In contrast to expression of α1 alone, co-expression with the β subunit promoted formation of monodisperse assemblies. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that the α and β subunits can tolerate large truncations in the non-conserved M3/M4 cytoplasmic loop without compromising oligomeric assembly or GABA-gated channel activity, although removal of N-linked glycosylation sites is negatively correlated with expression level. Additionally, we report methods to improve GABAA receptor expression in mammalian cell culture that employ recombinant baculovirus transduction. From these methods we have identified a well-behaving minimal functional construct for the α1/β1 GABAA receptor subtype that can be purified in milligram quantities while retaining high affinity agonist binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W2883970137,"We document rapid and abrupt clearings of large portions of the subtropical marine low cloud deck that have implications for the global radiation balance and climate sensitivity. Over the southeast Atlantic, large areas of stratocumulus are quickly eroded, yielding partial or complete clearing along sharp transitions hundreds to thousands of kilometers in length that move westward at 8 to 12 meters per second and travel as far as 1000+ kilometers from the African coast. The westward-moving cloudiness reductions have an annual peak in occurrence in the period from April through June. The cloud erosion boundaries reduce cloud at ≈10-kilometer scale in less than 15 minutes, move approximately perpendicular to the mean flow, and are often accompanied by small-scale wave features. Observations suggest that the cloud erosion is caused by atmospheric gravity waves."

While it is known that contemporary factors have drastically changed the epidemiology of twins in certain developed countries, in Brazil, relevant data are still scarce. Thus, we carried out a population-based study of live births in spatial and temporal dimensions using data from Brazil's Live Birth Information System, which covers the entire country. Over 41 million births registered between 2001 and 2014 were classified as singleton, twin or multiple. Twinning rates (TR) averaged 9.41 per 1,000 for the study period and a first-order autoregressive model of time-series analysis revealed a global upward trend over time; however, there were important regional differences. In fact, a Cluster and Outlier Analysis (Anselin Local Moran's I) was performed and identified clusters of high TR in an area stretching from the south of Brazil's Northeast Region to the South Region (Global Moran Index = 0.062, P < 0.001). Spearman's correlation coefficient and a Wilcoxon matched pairs test revealed a positive association between Human Development Index (HDI) and TRs in different scenarios, suggesting that the HDI might be an important indicator of childbearing age and assisted reproduction techniques in Brazil. Furthermore, there was a sharp increase of 26.42% in TR in women aged 45 and over during study period. The upward temporal trend in TRs is in line with recent observations from other countries, while the spatial analysis has revealed two very different realities within the same country. Our approach to TR using HDI as a proxy for underlying socioeconomic changes can be applied to other developing countries with regional inequalities resembling those found in Brazil."

Discovery of novel drugs against T. gondii infection could circumvent the toxicity of existing drugs and T. gondii resistance to current treatments. The autophagy-related protein 8 (Atg8)–Atg3 interaction in T. gondii is a promising drug target because of its importance for regulating Atg8 lipidation. We reported previously that TgAtg8 and TgAtg3 interact directly. Here we validated that substitutions of conserved residues of TgAtg8 interacting with the Atg8 family–interacting motif (AIM) in Atg3 disrupt the TgAtg8–TgAtg3 interaction and reduce TgAtg8 lipidation and autophagosome formation. These findings were consistent with results reported previously for Plasmodium Atg8, suggesting functional conservation of Atg8 in Toxoplasma and Plasmodium. Moreover, using peptide and AlphaScreen assays, we identified the AIM sequence in TgAtg3 that binds TgAtg8. We determined that the core TgAtg3 AIM contains a Phe239-Ala240-Asp241-Ile242 (239FADI242) signature distinct from the 105WLLP108 signature in the AIM of Plasmodium Atg3. Furthermore, an alanine-scanning assay revealed that the TgAtg8–TgAtg3 interaction in T. gondii also depends strongly on several residues surrounding the core TgAtg3 AIM, such as Asn238, Asp243, and Cys244. These results indicate that distinct AIMs in Atg3 contribute to differences between Toxoplasma and Plasmodium Atg8–Atg3 interactions. By elucidating critical residues involved in the TgAtg8–TgAtg3 interaction, our work paves the way for the discovery of potential anti-toxoplasmosis drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2884048899,"Cardiac muscle expresses three neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) splice variants: nNOSα, nNOSμ and nNOSβ. The functions of these nNOS splice variants in cardiac muscle, particularly myofilament-associated nNOSβ are unclear. To decipher cardiac nNOS splice variant function we investigated myofilament function and intracellular calcium and force transients in demembranated and intact papillary muscles from two lines of nNOS knockout mice. The first line (KN1) lacks nNOSα and nNOSμ. The second line (KN2) lacks active nNOSα, nNOSμ and nNOSβ. Demembranated KN1 papillary muscles exhibited reduced myofilament ATPase activity (-35%) and specific force (-10%) relative to controls. Demembranated KN2 muscles exhibited a smaller decrease in myofilament ATPase activity (-21%), but a greater reduction in specific force (-26%) relative to controls. Myofilament calcium sensitivity in demembranated KN1 and KN2 papillary muscles was similar to controls. Thus, papillary muscle-expressed nNOS splice variants are necessary for control levels of myofilament ATPase activity and force generation, but dispensable for myofilament calcium sensitivity. The greater reduction in myofilament ATPase relative to specific force in KN1, but not KN2 muscle, reduced the energy cost of muscle contraction, suggesting that nNOSβ increased the energetic efficiency of contraction in the absence of nNOSμ and nNOSα. Analyses of intact KN1 and KN2 papillary muscles showed that both intracellular calcium transients and their evoked force transients were similar to controls at stimulation frequencies between 1 and 3 Hz. Therefore, nNOS was dispensable for baseline excitation-contraction coupling. In summary, these data suggest that nNOS splice variants differentially regulate myofilament function, but not baseline calcium handling in papillary muscles. More importantly, they suggest that nNOSβ is a novel modulator of myofilament function, and ultimately the energetic efficiency of cardiac papillary muscle contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2884283282,"The study of binding site similarities can be relevant to understand the interaction of different drugs at several molecular targets. The increasing availability of protein crystal structures and the development of novel algorithms designed to evaluate three-dimensional similarities, represent a great opportunity to explore the existence of electronic and shape features shared by clinically relevant proteins, which could assist drug design and discovery. Proteins involved in the recognition of monoaminergic neurotransmitters, such as monoamine transporters or monoamine oxidases (MAO) have been related to several psychiatric and neurological disorders such as depression or Parkinson's disease. In this work, we evaluated the possible existence of similarities among the binding sites of the serotonin transporter (SERT), the dopamine transporter (DAT), MAO-A and MAO-B. This study was carried out using molecular simulation methodologies linked to the statistical algorithm PocketMatch, which was modified in order to obtain similarities profiles. Our results show that DAT and SERT exhibit a high degree of 3-D similarities all along the pathway that is presumably involved in the substrate transport process. Distinct differences, on the other hand, were found both at the extracellular and the intracellular ends of the transporters, which might be involved in the selective initial recognition of the corresponding substrate. Similarities were also found between the active (catalytic) site of MAO-A and the extracellular vestibule of SERT (the S2 binding site). These results suggest some degree of structural convergence for these proteins, which have different functions, tissue distribution and genetic origin, but which share the same endogenous ligand (serotonin). Beyond the functional implications, these findings are valuable for the design of both selective and non-selective ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2884414823,"One-compartment models are widely used to quantify hemodynamic parameters such as perfusion, blood volume and mean transit time. These parameters are routinely used for clinical diagnosis and monitoring of disease development and are thus of high relevance. However, it is known that common estimation techniques are discretization dependent and values can be erroneous. In this paper we present a new model that enables systematic quantification of discretization errors. Specifically, we introduce a continuous flow model for tracer propagation within the capillary tissue, used to evaluate state-of-the-art one-compartment models. We demonstrate that one-compartment models are capable of recovering perfusion accurately when applied to only one compartment, i.e. the whole region of interest. However, substantial overestimation of perfusion occurs when applied to fractions of a compartment. We further provide values of the estimated overestimation for various discretization levels, and also show that overestimation can be observed in real-life applications. Common practice of using compartment models for fractions of tissue violates model assumptions and careful interpretation is needed when using the computed values for diagnosis and treatment planning."
https://openalex.org/W2883527624,"Fire is a key process in eucalypt communities, exerting a strong influence on the composition, structure and functioning of forests. Much of the research on the fire response of temperate, wet-sclerophyll trees in Australia comes from Victoria, where the dominant eucalypt is Eucalyptus regnans. In contrast, central and northern Tasmanian forests, dominated by Eucalyptus delegatensis, are relatively understudied. There is a need to determine whether Tasmanian wet-sclerophyll forests, though the same forest type in name, are functionally different in floristics and response to fire. Here we document the forest community response to a natural wildfire event in Tasmania—using opportunistic before/after control/impact (BACI) data from pre-existing monitoring plots. Uniting pre- and post-fire floristic data, we quantified mortality and regeneration of eucalypt, acacia and other dominant tree species, and tree ferns, Dicksonia antarctica, in response to wildfire. We also evaluated the density of eucalypt and acacia seedling establishment between burnt and unburnt forests, and quantified faunal responses to fire. Despite moderate-to-high intensity burning in patches across the plot, mortality of eucalypts, acacias and tree ferns due to fire were low. By contrast, fire-sensitive rainforest species showed low survival, though were able to persist in unburnt refugia. Eucalypt and acacia seedling regeneration was high in the burnt plot, suggesting that E. delegatensis forests regenerate without stand-replacing fire events. This contrasts to Victorian E. regnans forests, whose persistence is dependent on high-severity stand-replacing events. We also found some group-specific avifaunal and invertebrate responses to the fire event, which are broadly reflective of responses documented in other Victorian-based studies. Our results have implications for Tasmanian wet-forest silvicultural practices, which are based on the principle of stand-replacement after fire. The broader relevance of this work to forest ecology is in demonstrating the serendipitous opportunities that can arise with baseline monitoring plots."
https://openalex.org/W2883277200,"In the brain, glutamate transporters terminate excitatory neurotransmission by removing this neurotransmitter from the synapse via cotransport with three sodium ions into the surrounding cells. Structural studies have identified the binding sites of the three sodium ions in glutamate transporters. The residue side-chains directly interact with the sodium ions at the Na1 and Na3 sites and are fully conserved from archaeal to eukaryotic glutamate transporters. The Na2 site is formed by three main-chain oxygens on the extracellular reentrant hairpin loop HP2 and one on transmembrane helix 7. A glycine residue on HP2 is located closely to the three main-chain oxygens in all glutamate transporters, except for the astroglial transporter GLT-1, which has a serine residue at that position. Unlike for WT GLT-1, substitution of the serine residue to glycine enables sustained glutamate transport also when sodium is replaced by lithium. Here, using functional and simulation studies, we studied the role of this serine/glycine switch on cation selectivity of substrate transport. Our results indicate that the side-chain oxygen of the serine residues can form a hydrogen bond with a main-chain oxygen on transmembrane helix 7. This leads to an expansion of the Na2 site such that water can participate in sodium coordination at Na2. Furthermore, we found other molecular determinants of cation selectivity on the nearby HP1 loop. We conclude that subtle changes in the composition of the two reentrant hairpin loops determine the cation specificity of acidic amino acid transport by glutamate transporters. In the brain, glutamate transporters terminate excitatory neurotransmission by removing this neurotransmitter from the synapse via cotransport with three sodium ions into the surrounding cells.

In the brain, signaling by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is terminated by transport from the cleft into the cells surrounding the synapse.

A recently solved GltTk structure confirmed the predicted location of the third sodium-binding site (13Guskov A. Jensen S. Faustino I. Marrink S.J. Slotboom D.J.

The Na2 site is formed by three main-chain oxygens of the HP2 loop and another one from TM7a. Functional and structural studies indicate that the role of sodium binding to the Na2 is to stabilize the HP2 loop in the conformation that closes the binding pocket (9Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D.

In close proximity of the HP2 main-chain oxygens, a glycine residue is conserved in the glutamate transporters, except for the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1, where a serine residue occupies this position (Ser-440, which is equivalent to Gly-354 of GltPh). Remarkably, replacement of this serine residue by glycine conferred the ability of lithium to drive transport (18Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Two serine residues of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 are crucial for coupling the fluxes of sodium and the neurotransmitter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In contrast to ion channels, our knowledge on the structural basis of ion selectivity in ion-coupled transporters is very limited. Thus, analysis of the structural basis of cation selectivity by mutants of residue 440 in GLT-1 and at the equivalent positions in other glutamate transporters offers an opportunity to obtain information on molecular determinants of cation selectivity in the glutamate transporter family. Therefore, we have studied the role of this serine/glycine switch and other mutants at nearby positions in cation specificity, using functional and simulation studies. A BLAST search was performed using the sequences of GltPh, GLT-1, and the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1. Up to 500 sequences were selected with a sequence identity of 60% or higher. These sequences were aligned removing incomplete sequences. All sequences of GltPh and EAAC1 homologues have a glycine in the HP2 loop, whereas all GLT-1 sequences carry a serine residue in the corresponding position. A Consurf analysis and a mapping of the residue conservation score (32Ashkenazy H. Abadi S. Martz E. Chay O. Mayrose I. Pupko T. Ben-Tal N. ConSurf 2016: an improved methodology to estimate and visualize evolutionary conservation in macromolecules.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (10.1093/nar/gkw408 27166375): W344-W350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) on to the 3D structure of GltPh-WT (PDB ID %2NWX) (Fig. 1C) revealed that the substrate-binding site and the binding sites of the three sodium as well as the HP2 loop are highly conserved. Specifically, using the analysis of 500 ortholog sequences of GltPh, GLT-1, and EAAC1, we found that the residue in the respective position Gly-354/Ser-440/Gly-410 is 100% conserved. The data also showed that the HP2 loop between the Na2 site and position Gly-354/Ser-440/Gly-410 is very much conserved, supporting the notion of the functional relevance of the studied region. To determine whether the selectivity in GLT-1 of sodium over lithium is determined by the polarity and/or the size of the amino acid residue at position 440, Ser-440 was mutated to a variety of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. Uptake of d-[3H]aspartate by S440G was around 25% of wildtype (WT) GLT-1 (Figs. 2A and 3A, Table 1). In agreement with our earlier observations (18Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Two serine residues of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 are crucial for coupling the fluxes of sodium and the neurotransmitter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96 (10.1073/pnas.96.4.1710 9990089): 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we find that the selectivity for sodium over lithium to sustain transport was dramatically reduced by the mutation. We found that transport by GLT-1-WT in the presence of lithium was only 2–3% compared with the presence of sodium. In contrast, lithium was least as effective as sodium to support uptake of d-[3H]aspartate by the S440G mutant (Fig. 2B, Table 1). Enlargement of the side-chain at position 440 by replacing Ser-440 with the larger hydrophobic isoleucine or leucine resulted in nondetectable transport activity (Fig. 3A, Table 1), prohibiting the measurement of sodium selectivity. This result could be the consequence of an intrinsic effect of the mutation on the transport activity, for instance, by a perturbing the Na2 site.Figure 3.Characterization of transport activity and cation selectivity of nonpolar Ser-440 mutants of GLT-1. HeLa cells expressing GLT-1 and nonpolar Ser-440 mutants in the pBluescript SK(−) background were measured for sodium (A)- and lithium (B)-dependent d-[3H]aspartate uptake (plotted as % Li/Na) at room temperature for 10 min, as described under “Experimental procedures.” Individual data points are shown as triangles, the horizontal line represents the mean ± S.D.

Therefore, we determined the expression levels of the WT and all Ser-440 mutant transporters at the plasma membrane by biotinylation of external lysine residues, using the membrane-impermeant Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. After lysis of the cells, the biotinylated proteins were isolated using streptavidin-agarose beads followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an antibody that is specific for GLT-1 (see “Experimental procedures”). Specificity is confirmed with cells expressing only vector (SK, Fig. 4), which showed the absence of any band. The upper and lower parts of the broad band represent the fully N-glycosylated transporters and the immature transporters, respectively (33Silverstein N. Crisman T.J. Forrest L.R. Kanner B.I.

The S440L and S440I mutants exhibited plasma membrane expression of 30–40% of that of GLT-1–WT (Fig. 4, Table 2). However, because these mutants were devoid of any transport activity (Fig. 3A), we conclude that they have an intrinsic transport defect. The surface expression of the S440G mutant was also lower than that of GLT-1–WT (Table 2). When normalized for the expression levels, the activity of S440G was more than 40% of that of WT GLT-1 (Fig. 4, Table 2).Table 2Transport of GLT-1 mutants normalized to surface expressionMutantd-[3H]Asp uptake of WTIntensity, normalized to WTd-[3H]Asp uptake/intensity of WT%%WT1001100S440G25.0 ± 3.90.58 ± 0.3043.0S440A50.4 ± 4.00.55 ± 0.0991.7S440D3.3 ± 0.80.45 ± 0.147.3S440I0.4 ± 0.50.38 ± 0.121.1S440L0.6 ± 0.80.29 ± 0.072.1S440T34.8 ± 1.80.40 ± 0.2787.1S440V3.0 ± 0.80.82 ± 0.093.5S440N22.3 ± 3.01.01 ± 0.1522.1 Open table in a new tab The mutant where Ser-440 was replaced by threonine, which maintains the side-chain hydroxyl group (S440T), exhibited a slightly higher activity than S440G (Fig. 2A, Table 1). After correcting for surface expression, transport activity of S440T was over 80% compared with GLT-1–WT (Fig. 4, Table 2). The sodium/lithium selectivity of sustaining transport by this conservative replacement was similar or maybe even higher than GLT-1–WT (Fig. 2B, Table 1). Transport of d-[3H]aspartate by the hydrophilic replacement mutant S440N was around 20% compared with GLT-1–WT, also after normalizing for the surface expression (Figs. 2A and 4, Table 1, Table 2). The sodium selectivity of transport of d-[3H]aspartate remained similar to WT (Fig. 2B, Table 1)). The activity of S440D was very low (Fig. 2A), mainly due to its low expression at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4, Table 2). Nevertheless, our transport assay is sensitive enough to monitor the sodium selectivity of transport, which was also similar to GLT-1–WT (Fig. 2B, Table 1). Substitution of Ser-440 by alanine resulted in transport levels that were between GLT-1–WT and S440G (Fig. 3A, Table 1). Interestingly, the sodium selectivity of this conservative mutant was also strongly reduced, although not as much as in S440G (Fig. 3B, Table 1). Further enlargement of the side-chain of Ser-440 with the hydrophobic amino acid valine resulted in low yet detectable levels of transport (Fig. 3A, Table 1), whereas its sodium selectivity remained similar to GLT-1–WT (Fig. 3B, Table 1). Also, the plasma membrane expression level of the low activity S440V mutant was similar to that of GLT-1–WT as judged by surface biotinylation (Fig. 4, Table 2). Thus, the low level of transport by this mutant is caused by a functional defect of the transporter. The crystal structures of the archeal transporter homologue GltPh indicate that HP2 contributes several interacting groups to the Na2 site (9Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Coupling substrate and ion binding to extracellular gate of a sodium-dependent aspartate transporter.Nature. 2007; 445 (10.1038/nature05455 17230192): 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). These groups are close to the glycine residue that occupies the equivalent position of Ser-440 of GLT-1 (position 354 in GltPh). Transport of d-[3H]aspartate and l-[3H]aspartate by reconstituted GltPh-G354S was similar to GltPh-WT (Fig. 5A, Table 1). Importantly, the sodium selectivity of transport of both d- and l-[3H]aspartate was dramatically increased by the G354S mutation, because the ability to transport in the sole presence of lithium was lost (Fig. 5B, Table 1). This indicates that the observations on the sodium specificity of residue Ser-440 in GLT-1 are recapitulated in GltPh. Therefore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the molecular origin of the effects using GltPh-WT and GltPh mutants in which Gly-354 was replaced by Ser or Leu. The structure of GltPh-WT (PDB ID %2NWX) (Fig. 1) was used in this study and the mutant structures were modeled by replacing Gly-354 with serine or leucine. Trimeric transporters were inserted in a pre-equilibrated POPC membrane and simulated for 100 ns. The systems were extensively energy minimized after insertion, followed by a slow release of the constraints on GltPh, substrate, and co-transported ions in four 2.5-ns long steps (applying 1000, 100, 10, and 1 kJ/mol). All systems were simulated for 100 ns. The simulations showed that the sodium ion did not remain bound to the Na2 site in all protomers of all replications, indicating that the starting geometry was not ideal for sodium binding, as already observed earlier (34Venkatesan S. Saha K. Sohail A. Sandtner W. Freissmuth M. Ecker G.F. Sitte H.H. Stockner T. Refinement of the central steps of substrate transport by the aspartate transporter GltPh: elucidating the role of the Na2 sodium binding site.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11 (10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004551 26485255): e1004551Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In that study it was also found that the sodium in the Na2 site dissociated from transporter. This observation is force field independent, as we used the Amber force field in this study, whereas previously the OPLS force field was applied (35Jorgensen W.L. Maxwell D.S. TiradoRives J. Development and testing of the OPLS all-atom force field on conformational energetics and properties of organic liquids.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118 (10.1021/ja9621760): 11225-11236Crossref Scopus (10681) Google Scholar). Using different equilibration protocols did not significantly change the unbinding behavior. We repeated the simulations using the higher resolution (2.96 Å) GltPh-WT structure with the PDB ID %2NWL, which is structurally very similar to 2NWX, but was solved without co-crystallized ions. Again, a propensity of sodium unbinding from the Na2 site was observed. It is known from electrophysiological studies that two of the three sodium ions and the substrate bind fast, followed by slow binding of the third sodium ion (36Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. Early intermediates in the transport cycle of the neuronal excitatory amino acid carrier EAAC1.J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117 (10.1085/jgp.117.6.547 11382805): 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Most likely, sodium 1 and 3 and the substrate bind first and close the HP2 gate, whereas Na2 is the slow sodium-binding site. Slow binding does imply that structural adjustments are required or alternatively the binding energy is low. A previous study on GltPh (34Venkatesan S. Saha K. Sohail A. Sandtner W. Freissmuth M.

However, the importance of prehypertension in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is controversial. The aim of this study was to examine association between prehypertension, hypertension and atherosclerosis in T2DM.We recruited 179 Japanese patients with T2DM, who never took any medication for diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or atherosclerosis. Intima-media thickness (IMT) of common carotid artery was evaluated by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography.Multiple regression analysis adjusted for age, duration of diabetes, body mass index, HbA1c, fasting C-peptide, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed that systolic blood pressure (SBP), but not diastolic BP, was significantly and positively associated with maximum IMT (IMT-max), mean IMT, and plaque score (β = 0.28, p<0.001; β = 0.26, p = 0.047; and β = 0.25, p = 0.006, respectively). ROC analysis showed that the cut-off value of SBP to detect atherosclerosis (IMT-max 1.8mm, the mean of IMT-max of this subjects) was 133.5 (p = 0.008), while DBP was not useful to detect it (p = 0.433). Then, participants were categorized as normotension (SBP <119 mmHg), prehypertension (SBP 120-139 mmHg), and hypertension (>140 mmHg). Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for the variables described above plus gender and smoking showed that prehypertension and hypertension were significantly associated with the increased risk of atherosclerosis [prehypertension; odds ratio (OR) 3.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-10.76, p = 0.033, and hypertension; OR 7.29, 95%CI 1.99-26.78, p = 0.003].These findings suggest that prehypertension categorized by SBP is an important risk factor of atherosclerosis independently of conventional risk factors in patients with T2DM."
