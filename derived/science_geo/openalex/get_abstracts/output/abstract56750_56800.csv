https://openalex.org/W2133690123,"RNA polymerase has been solubilized from whole cell homogenates of the mouse myeloma tumor, MOPC 315. Four forms of the solubilized enzyme have been isolated by ion exchange chromatography and designated I, II, III a , and III b . The enzymes appear analogous to the Class I, II, and III RNA polymerases defined in other eukaryotic systems. Ionic strength optima, metal ion effects, α-amanitin sensitivities, and relative activities with poly[d(A-T)] and calf thymus DNA templates are different for Class I, II, and III RNA polymerases, but are identical for III a and III b . For the Class I and Class II enzymes ionic strength optima occur, respectively, at 0.05 and 0.09 m ammonium sulfate with either calf thymus DNA or poly[d(A-T)] as template. By contrast, the ionic strength activation profiles for Class III RNA polymerases with calf thymus DNA template are biphasic with polytima at 0.055 and 0.17 m ammonium sulfate; but with poly[d(A-T)] the profiles are monophasic with optima at 0.055 m . Although RNA polymerase I is completely resistant to α-amanitin at concentrations up to 400 µg per ml, RNA polymerases II and III can both be inhibited completely by the toxin. However, the sensitivity of RNA polymerase II (50% inhibition at 0.025 µg per ml) is much greater than that of the Class III RNA polymerases (50% inhibition at 20 µg per ml). Furthermore, the poly[d(A-T)] to calf thymus DNA activity ratios are considerably greater for the Class III RNA polymerases than for RNA polymerases I and II. By measuring RNA polymerase activity in DEAE-Sephadex fractions at α-amanitin concentrations just sufficient to inhibit RNA polympolymerase II and in the presence of poly[d(A-T)] RNA polymerase III activity has been detected in all tissues examined. When the amounts of the different enzymes were measured in subcellular fractions of myeloma cells, RNA polymerase I was found predominantly in the nucleolar fraction, II and III a predominantly in the nucleoplasmic fraction, and III b predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction. This latter observation raises the possibility that this enzyme may be of cytoplasmic origin. Cellular levels of the RNA polymerases have been compared in MOPC 315 tissues and in normal tissues under various physiological conditions. Levels of Enzymes I and III are increased in the myeloma relative to calf thymus, mouse liver, and mouse spleen, and are increased in liver and spleen from tumor-bearing mice and younger (6 weeks) mice relative to tumor-free mice and older mice (10 meeks), respectively. Levels of Enzyme II are more invariant under these circumstances. These data are discussed in terms of possible regulatory roles of the three enzyme classes."

A similar protective effect has been reported in the organism during photodynamic inactivation, where it is attributable to the quenchintg of singlet excited oxygen by carotenoids. The findings with leukocytes support the suggestion that singlet excited oxygen acts as one of the mediators of their bactericidal action."
https://openalex.org/W1591050105,"Abstract A mitogenic lectin has been isolated from garden peas (Pisum sativum) by affinity chromatography on Sephadex. The lectin has a molecular weight of 49,000, consists of two pairs of noncovalently linked polypeptide subunits and contains less than 0.5% by weight of carbohydrate. The small subunit (α) has a molecular weight of 7,000 and the large subunit (β) a molecular weight of 17,000. Examination of the tryptic digests of the subunits showed that the α subunit is not a fragment of the β subunit produced by a specific proteolytic cleavage. Pea lectin purified by affinity chromatography is a mixture of two closely related proteins which have the same subunit structure but which differ on a charge basis. The more acidic component (A) of pea lectin was present in about half the amount of the more basic component (B). The charge differences between the two components result exclusively from differences in their α subunits. Pea lectin has two binding sites for mannose (Ka = 1.4 x 103 liters per mole) and methyl α-d-glucoside (Ka = 0.8 x 103 liters per mole)."
https://openalex.org/W2004428040,Exposure of male hamsters to short daily photoperiods (1 hour of light and 23 hours of darkness daily for 9 weeks led to total involution of the testes and accessory sex organs (seminal vesicles and coagulating glands). Pituitary levels of immunoreactive prolaction also decreased by about 60 percent after dark exposure. The inhibitory effects of darkness on the reproductive organs were prevented either by pinealectomy or by the subcutaneous implantation of a melatonin-beeswax pellet into the animals each week. Both pinealectomy and melatonin treatment also returned pituitary levels of prolactin toward normal. The results suggest that melatonin is not the pineal antigonadotrophic factor in the male golden hamster.

https://openalex.org/W1479760152,"Abstract The intraperitoneal administration of aromatic hydrocarbons such as 3-methylcholanthrene or β-naphthoflavone stimulates aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene) hydroxylase activity in C57BL/6N, C57BL/6J, C3H/HeN, BALB/cAnN, CBA/HN, and PL/J inbred mice but not in the DBA/2N, 129/J, RF/J, AKR/N, AKR/J, or AU/SsJ inbred strains. By means of genetic crosses between a responsive and a nonresponsive strain, the hydroxylase induction appears to segregate as an autosomal dominant trait in the C57BL/6N x RF/J cross, the C57BL/6N x 129/J cross, the C3H/HeN x AKR/N cross, the BALB/cAnN x AKR/N cross, the CBA/HN x AKR/N cross, the BALB/cAnN x DBA/2N cross, the C57BL/6N x AU/SsJ cross, the PL/J x AU/SsJ cross, the C57BL/6J x AKR/J cross, the C57BL/6N x AKR/J cross, and the C57BL/6J x AKR/N cross. The absence of hydroxylase induction appears to segregate in an autosomal dominant fashion in the C57BL/6N x AKR/N cross. The induction process in offspring from the C3H/HeN x DBA/2N cross is inherited additively. In mice from many of the above mentioned crosses, there exists a positive, significant correlation between the induced hepatic hydroxylase activity and (a) new formation of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P1-450; (b) higher inducible hydroxylase activities in lung, kidney, bowel, and skin; and (c) induction of hepatic microsomal 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, p-nitroanisole-O-demethylase, and 3-methyl-4-methylaminoazobenzene N-demethylase activities. We have found no exceptions to this general observation. The basal hydroxylase activity appears to be inherited additively, within the limits of individual variation. From data involving more than 2200 individual mice of these 12 inbred strains, the induction of the monooxygenase activities and the stimulation of cytochrome P1-450 formation by aromatic hydrocarbons appear to be regulated by at least three alleles at each of two nonlinked genetic loci."

https://openalex.org/W2049946649,"It is evident that the smoking of marijuana by human subjects does have a detrimental effect on their driving skills and performance in a restricted driving area, and that this effect is even greater under normal conditions of driving on city streets. The effect of marijuana on driving is not uniform for all subjects, however, but is in fact bidirectional; whether or not a significant decline occurs in driving ability is dependent both on the subject's capacity to compensate and on the dose of marijuana. For those subjects who improved their performance, the explanation may lie in overcompensation and possibly the sedative effect of the drug. Whereas the street portion of this study approximated normal driving conditions, it should be emphasized that the context of the driving experience een on city streets was experimental. the design of this study maximal safeguards in terms of a dual control vehicle and a driver observr; in addition, the subjects were proffessionally screened and, with rare exception, they were emotionally stable. Given the experimental setting and set, the safeguards, and the nature of the study sample, idiosyncratic behaviour that might occure under normal driving condition would be less likely to occur in a study such as this. Other identified factors might lead to more stringent conclussions regarding the effects of marijuana on driving.The first is night driving, which may be more stressful. But an even more important unanswered question is the cumulative effect of alcohol and marijuana on driving (64 percent of the study sample reported alcohol in combination with marihjuana before driving). Third, the doses of marijuana used in this study were within the range of social marijuana usage(1); more heroic doses might be taken before driving. Fourth, the effect of marijuana on reactions and decision during high speed is still another unknown. What are the recommendations that emarge from this study? Driving under the influence of marijuana should be avoided as much as should driving under the influence of alcohol. More investigation is urgently required-and high priority should be given to studies that approximate normal conditions of driving and in which alcohol and marijuana are administered to the same subjects."
https://openalex.org/W1966275972,"Two methylated species of mammalian cytoplasmic RNA from HeLa cells are described. They migrate at about 74% (A) and 86% (B) of the speed of 5S rRNA on 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Upon continuous incubation with 3H-uridine, when the rate of isotope incorporation into 5S rRNA ceases to be linear, the 3H levels of these species quickly decrease, indicating their short life. By “chase” with 5μg of actinomycin D/ml, their half lives are about 10 min. A and B appear to be coded by the nuclear genome, as ethidium bromide has little effect on their transcription. There must be a very brief nuclear processing step, if any, because A and B can be detected in the cytoplasm after 4 min of incubation with 3H-uridine, the shortest time tested. They do not seem to be part of the 45S precursor rRNA transcript, as their synthesis is not inhibited by 0.04 μg of actinomycin D/ml. Similar species have been found in hamster and mouse cells. Contamination by mycoplasmas could not be detected."

https://openalex.org/W2022266915,"uman and insect population control have several features in common, all of them indicating that the lag times in converting laboratory discoveries into practical agents are increasing greatly and that ROI calculations are becoming more and more significant in decisions related to the development of new agents. ROI calculations are particularly important in the field of insect control because, by being more specific, the agents of the future are likely to cover smaller markets. Several recommendations for stimulating the development of new methods of insect control are proposed which are addressed primarily to policy-makers. If they are not implemented, then our suggestions should at least stimulate others to make alternative proposals. If neither event occurs, then it is unlikely that there will be any fundamentally new approaches to practical insect control in this decade; a similar prediction (6) that was made 4 years ago in the field of human birth control is rapidly proving to be correct."

https://openalex.org/W1507219096,"Abstract The NH2-terminal peptide fragment (1–24) of dog serum albumin was obtained by a limited peptic hydrolysis of whole albumin. The peptide fragment was isolated and subsequently purified to homogeneity by trichloroacetic acid fractionation, Sephadex gel filtration, and high voltage electrophoresis at pH 2.0. The purity of the peptide was established by 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) analysis of the NH2-terminal residue, by amino acid analysis and by cellulose acetate electrophoresis at pH 8.6. The complete sequence, obtained by dansyl-Edman degradation on the whole peptide and by characterization of its tryptic peptides, was shown to be Glu-Ala-Tyr-Lys-Ser-Glu-Ile-Ala-His-Arg-Tyr-Asn-Asp-Leu-Gly-Glu-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Gly-Leu-Val-Leu, which gave a molecular weight of 2847. The amide charge was obtained by amino acid analysis of residues released after enzymic digestion of the tryptic peptide. It was proposed earlier that in dog serum albumin the lack of specificity of Cu(II) binding was due to the absence of a histidine residue in position 3 (Appleton, D. W., and Sarkar, B. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 5040–5046). The present results show that a single base change in the albumin gene has replaced the important histidine-3 residue, critical to the binding of Cu(II), with a tyrosine residue. The homology between the NH2-terminal peptide from dog serum albumin and those from bovine, rat and human is discussed. To elucidate the role of these first 24 residues in the observed binding phenomenon of the intact dog serum albumin molecule, Cu(II)-binding properties of the peptide fragment were investigated by spectrophotometric and proton displacement studies. In both the intact protein and the 1–24 peptide fragment, the first equivalent of Cu(II) is distributed between at least two sites, indicating a nonspecific binding. This partitioning of the first equivalent of Cu(II) probably occurs between the NH2-terminal binding site and another site containing a histidine residue. Thus, a mutation in the codon specifying residue 3 in the dog peptide has resulted in an altered Cu(II) binding site of reduced specificity."

Human erythrocytes adhered in vitro to the surface of human cancer cells obtained from autopsy and biopsy.

https://openalex.org/W1495666670,"The dissociation of normal and carboxypeptidase-digested human hemoglobin has been studied by gel filtration under several experimental conditions. These include (a) different derivatives, notably deoxy-, oxy-, and CO-hemoglobin, (b) changes in solvent composition and in pH, and (c) addition of inositol hexaphosphate. In normal hemoglobin, in agreement with previous results, the deoxygenated derivative is much less dissociated than the oxy or CO ones. This difference is observed also in some of the digested hemoglobins, but tends to vanish in those proteins in which, as a result of extensive digestion, the conformational change accompanying ligand binding is abolished. The dissociation of normal and digested hemoglobins is affected by solvent composition, is at a minimum at pH near 8, and is decreased by the addition of inositol hexaphosphate. Parallel flash photolysis experiments, performed under conditions identical with those used in the gel filtration studies, indicate that the appearance of quickly reacting material parallels dissociation into dimers in normal hemoglobin. Both in normal and digested hemoglobins conditions which decrease dissociation decrease the fraction of rapidly reacting material. In the digested hemoglobins the fraction of rapidly reacting material may be much higher than can be accounted for by the amount of dimers, indicating in these cases that the tetramers may be rapidly reacting. The data point once again to the critical role of the COOH-terminal residues in maintaining the subunit structure of hemoglobin and the interaction effects associated with it."

These results were further supported by hybridization experiments using both all-trans-retinol-RBP and all-trans-3-dehydroretinol-RBP and prealbumin.

No cofactors or metals were required for the reaction. Fraction A can exist in two molecular weight forms demonstrated during sucrose density gradient centrifugation at low (5 mm Tris) and high (50 mm Tris) ionic strength. The stimulating protein, designated Fraction B, stimulated the activity of Fraction A at high ionic strength. Magnesium ion was required for this stimulation. Highly purified GTP cyclohydrolase was obtained after affinity chromatography of Fraction A. The activity of the purified enzyme was influenced by: (a) the amount of enzyme protein present; (b) the ionic strength of the assay medium; and (c) the presence of the stimulatory protein plus MgCl2.

https://openalex.org/W1527584579,"Abstract Highly purified ovine follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was separated into two noncovalently linked, nonidentical subunits (α and β) by treatment with 8 m urea followed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex. The individual subunits were purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. This step resulted in the removal of a larger molecular weight contaminant from the β subunit. This contaminant, designated as undissociated FSH because of its relatively high biological activity, was not dissociated by further treatment with urea, suggesting that it may consist of covalently linked subunits. Although their electrophoretic mobilities differed greatly, both subunits exhibited microheterogeneity as indicated by analytical acrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights of native FSH and the α and β subunits as determined by ultracentrifugation were 33,000, 15,500, and 18,500, respectively. The subunits contained the amino acids and carbohydrates usually found in glycoprotein hormones with the exception that methionine was not present in the β subunit. Although they differed markedly in amino acid and carbohydrate content, both subunits exhibited relatively high amounts of threonine, halfcystine, glucosamine, and mannose. The amino acid composition of the α subunit was very similar to the amino acid contents of the α subunits of ovine and bovine luteinizing hormone. The sum of the amino acid and carbohydrate contents of the two subunits corresponded well with the amino acid and carbohydrate composition of the native FSH. Incubation of the biologically inactive α and β subunits followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 resulted in reconstituted FSH which possessed approximately 68% of the biological activity of the original FSH as measured by the augmentation bioassay. The reconstituted FSH was almost as potent as the original FSH in the ability to stimulate the prostates, seminal vesicles, and testes in hypophysectomized male rats."
https://openalex.org/W1603159028,"Previous work has shown that bacteriophage Qβ RNA is translated by cell-free extracts of Krebs II mouse ascites cells. The major product of the reaction is the phage coat protein (M orrison , T. G. & L odish , H. F. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 315–319; A viv , H., B oime , I., L oyd , B. & L eder , P. (1972) Science 178, 1293–1295). Here we show that ascites cell extracts directed by Qβ RNA also synthesize Qβ replicase and, in addition, a polypeptide which results from initiation of protein synthesis in the interior of the replicase gene. This polypeptide is made in amounts equivalent to that of the replicase. Extracts of ascites cells directed by bacteriophage f2 RNA synthesize the phage coat and replicase, but the major products of the reaction do not co-migrate with authentic f2 protein. These major products are also made in reactions directed by f2 RNA which contain nonsense mutations in any of the three f2 genes. f2 RNA directs incorporation of initiator formyl[35S]methionine into authentic chymotryptic and tryptic peptides of the f2 coat and replicase, but formyl-[35S]methionine is also incorporated into several initiator sequences not found in authentic f2 proteins. These results indicate that ascites ribosomes initiate protein synthesis at both authentic initiation regions and at spurious regions. These incorrect initiations on bacteriophage RNAs by mammalian ribosomes are in marked contrast to the correct initiation by mammalian ribosomes on mammalian viral and cellular RNAs in cell-free systems."
https://openalex.org/W1994503252,"A very large percentage of Mexico's population living in rural areas lacks resources for health care. Any new effort to provide such care must emphasize the health of the infant population because of the high percentage of infants in the country. Plans made at the national level have not been correlated with the conditions that exist in rural areas. For example, the majority of university programs are oriented toward urban medical practice, and the construction of more schools of medicine to solve the problem of doctors in rural areas is based on a mistaken premise. This problem has not been solved even in developed countries such as the United States where, as in Mexico, graduates in medicine migrate to the cities where optimal conditions are met for practicing the type of medicine for which they have been trained. Furthermore, it is both expensive and illogical to maintain urban doctors in rural areas where they cannot practice their profession for lack of resources; to do so is to deny the purpose of their education (27). Conventional schools of medicine, for reasons of investment and of structure, should teach only very selected groups of students who, on finishing their training, are fully capacitated to practice specialized medicine. A different system is required if we are to provide adequate health care in the rural communities. A system such as that described herein, adapted to the real need of rural communities, would avoid the necessity to create dysfunctional bureaucracies and would not destroy those institutions which have proved useful in the past. This study should be considered as one of the many pilot programs that should be initiated in order to determine the type of program that would best solve the problem of health care in rural Mexico. Other programs already being considered at the National Autonomous University of Mexico include the A36 plan of the Faculty of Medicine, now in operation; the work of C. Biro carried out in Netzahualcoyotl City (both focused on providing medical care to the urban poor); and the Open University program. Unless an efficient program designed to meet the needs of rural communities is quickly put into operation, Mexico will, in the near future, be facing the same problems now confronting Southeast Asia."

https://openalex.org/W2015751629,"Diffraction patterns that are highly reproducible, of useful quality, and consistent with the input generating them can be easily obtained with a microscope system. The input can be either a reduced photograph or a thin section. With two exceptions, the relationships between a thin section and its diffraction pattern produced by a petrographic microscope are the same as the relationships between a photographic input and its diffraction pattern produced by a conventional ODA system. The exceptions are that the diffraction patterns generated directly by the thin sections may be asymmetrical or, if the thin section is sufficiently heterogeneous, may be smeared. The microscope system is generally more useful than a conventional ODA system for the analysis of microfabric in thin sections. One can readily use the microscope system to analyze elements of widely varying spatial frequency simply by changing the objectives. The diffraction patterns can be magnified by changing to a higherpower ocular. In most cases the microscope-generated diffraction pattern transmits the useful spatial information in the thin section more completely than the conventionally produced diffraction pattern; the photographic inputs for the conventionally produced diffraction pattern emphasize lower-frequency spatial information. This property, combined with the microscope system's better response to twinning, makes the microscope more sensitive to commonly used microfabric elements. For the analysis of thin sections, a conventional ODA system is superior to the microscope system in only three cases. First, if one wants to analyze the entire thin section at one time, a conventional system must be used with a photographic input of the thin section. Second, if the thin section is extremely heterogeneous (crystallographically or mineralogically), the microscope-generated diffraction pattern may exhibit gross smearing even with the highestpower objectives available. Finally, the thin section may contain only elements of low spatial frequency that will not generate diffraction dots far enough radially from the central spot to be resolvable. More study will be needed to establish the precision of spatial frequency measurements from diffraction patterns generated directly by thin sections with the microscope system. Experiments with a variety of film types and sources of illumination will, in all likelihood, lead to a reduction in the exposure times used to record diffraction patterns with the microscope (9). A complete ODA system must have directional and frequency-filtering capabilities. In order to establish these capabilities for the microscope system, components will need to be designed and fabricated and the microscope body may have to be modified. The possibility of applying the microscope technique in reflected light on a real-time basis should be investigated. This would be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of microfracture initiation and propagation and the analysis of overall fabric changes during experimental deformation of rock both in situ and in the laboratory. The technique presented here can be used with a less expensive microscope, if it has a focusable Bertrand lens. Our experiments with relatively inexpensive microscopes indicated that the only major problem is alignment of the illuminating system (light-filter-condenser)."
