https://openalex.org/W2162704444,"Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are produced at high concentration by bacteria in the gut and subsequently released in the bloodstream. Basal acetate concentrations in the blood (about 100 μm) can further increase to millimolar concentrations following alcohol intake. It was known previously that SCFAs can activate leukocytes, particularly neutrophils. In the present work, we have identified two previously orphan G protein-coupled receptors, GPR41 and GPR43, as receptors for SCFAs. Propionate was the most potent agonist for both GPR41 and GPR43. Acetate was more selective for GPR43, whereas butyrate and isobutyrate were more active on GPR41. The two receptors were coupled to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, intracellular Ca2+ release, ERK1/2 activation, and inhibition of cAMP accumulation. They exhibited, however, a differential coupling to G proteins; GPR41 coupled exclusively though the Pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o family, whereas GPR43 displayed a dual coupling through Gi/o and Pertussis toxin-insensitive Gq protein families. The broad expression profile of GPR41 in a number of tissues does not allow us to infer clear hypotheses regarding its biological functions. In contrast, the highly selective expression of GPR43 in leukocytes, particularly polymorphonuclear cells, suggests a role in the recruitment of these cell populations toward sites of bacterial infection. The pharmacology of GPR43 matches indeed the effects of SCFAs on neutrophils, in terms of intracellular Ca2+ release and chemotaxis. Such a neutrophil-specific SCFA receptor is potentially involved in the development of a variety of diseases characterized by either excessive or inefficient neutrophil recruitment and activation, such as inflammatory bowel diseases or alcoholism-associated immune depression. GPR43 might therefore constitute a target allowing us to modulate immune responses in these pathological situations.

Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). In addition to about 160 characterized receptors, around 125 human genes encode proteins obviously belonging to this family of receptors, but their ligands and functions remain to be determined. These so far uncharacterized receptors are referred to as orphan GPCRs, but they are expected to play, by analogy with characterized members of the family, important roles in the regulation of physiological processes. For some orphan receptors, sequence similarity with well known receptors allows to construct hypotheses regarding the chemical nature of their ligands or their involvement in physiological processes. However, many orphan receptors are clustered in subfamilies with low similarity to characterized receptors.Orphan receptors led in a number of cases to the discovery of molecules that were not recognized previously as functional extracellular mediators. The chemical diversity among endogenous ligands of GPCRs is unique as it includes ions, bioamines, lipids, peptides, and large proteins, as well as a large number of odorant molecules.

George S.R. Nguyen T. Xu S. Kolakowski L.F. O'Dowd B.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). GPR41 and GPR42 have the same length and share 98% amino acid identity. The four genes encoding these receptors are intronless and are clustered onto chromosomal region 19q13.1. Although little information is available concerning these receptors, GPR41 was shown to induce apoptosis via a p53/Bax pathway in an ischemia/reperfusion paradigm (13Kimura M. Mizukami Y. Miura T. Fujimoto K. Kobayashi S. Matsuzaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26453-26460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, GPR43 and its murine orthologue LSSIG are induced during the differentiation of leukocyte progenitor cells to monocytes or neutrophils and were found mainly in hematopoietic tissues, suggesting that this receptor could have an important function in the differentiation and/or activation of leukocytes (14Senga T. Iwamoto S. Yoshida T. Yokota T. Adachi K. Azuma E. Hamaguchi M. Iwamoto T. Blood. 2003; 101: 1185-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).In this report, we showed that propionate, acetate, and other SCFAs act as specific activators of GPR41 and GPR43. An extensive pharmacological study revealed differences in the rank order of potency of SCFA toward each receptor, as well as in the G protein coupling leading to intracellular cascade activation. Pharmacological data obtained on human polymorphonuclear cells involved GPR43 as the main functional SCFA receptor on these cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Culture media, antibiotics, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and trypsin were from Bio-Whittaker. FuGENE 6, restriction, and DNA modifying enzymes were from Roche Diagnostics. [35S]GTPγS and myo-d-[2-3H]inositol (17.7 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Dowex AG1X8 (formate form) was from Bio-Rad. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and Pertussis toxin were from Sigma. Forskolin and isobutylmethylxanthine were from Eurobiochem (Louvain la Neuve, Belgium). Oligonucleotide primers were from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). Total and messenger RNAs were from Ambion (Huntingdon, Great Britain).Cloning and Sequencing of Human GPR43 and Human GPR41— Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized on the basis of the sequence of the human GPR41 and GPR43 receptors (GenBank™ accession numbers AF024688 and AF024690, respectively). For GPR43 cloning, sense primer 5′-CCGGAATTCACCATGCTGCCGGACTGGAAG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CTTGTCTAGACTACTCTGTAGTGAAGTC-3′ were used in a PCR amplification using human genomic DNA as template and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) under the following conditions: 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, 3 cycles; 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 63 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, 30 cycles. A fragment of 1 kb containing the entire coding sequence of human GPR43 gene was amplified, digested by EcoRI and XbaI, and cloned in the bicistronic pEFIN5 expression vector. In the bicistronic vector, designated pEFIN5, both the recombinant receptor and the neomycin phosphotransferase selection marker are transcribed from a single promoter element.For GPR41 cloning, sense primer 5′-CCGGATATCACCATGGATACAGGCCCCGAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CTTGTCTAGACTAGCTTTCAGCACAGGC-3′ were used in a similar strategy, except that the coding sequence was cloned using EcoRV and XbaI. All the inserts of the resulting plasmids were sequenced on both strands using the Big-Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequence alignment was performed using the ClustalX software, version 1.8 (15Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35206) Google Scholar), and dendrograms were constructed using TreeView.Tissue Distribution of GPR41 and GPR43—Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR experiments were carried out using a panel of total RNA (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), dendritic cells, monocytes, T lymphocytes, small intestine) and poly(A)+ RNA (thymus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, lung, stomach, adipose, breast). The total RNA from neutrophils was prepared from venous blood of healthy donors using TriPure (Roche Diagnostics). Approximately 50 ng of poly(A)+ RNA or 500 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) and used for PCR. Human GPR43 and GPR41 receptors transcripts were detected by PCR using the following primers: 5′-TTCTACAGCAGCATCTACTG-3′ (GPR43 forward), 5′-GAAGCACACCAGGAAATTGA-3′ (GPR43 reverse), 5′-TACGTCATAGAATTCTCAGG-3′ (GPR41 forward), and 5′-TGTTCACTGGTCTTTCTTTC-3′ (GPR41 reverse). The expected sizes of the amplified DNA bands were 439 and 508 bp for GPR43 and GPR41, respectively. PCR was performed using the Taq polymerase under the following conditions: 94 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s (for GPR43); or 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 35 s (for GPR41). A control was performed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA fragment (509 bp) as described previously (16Brezillon S. Lannoy V. Franssen J.D. Le Poul E. Dupriez V. Lucchetti J. Detheux M. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 776-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the PCR were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.Cell Culture and Transfection—The recombinant pEFIN5-GPR41, pEFIN5-GPR43 plasmids, and the empty pEFIN5 vector were transfected in CHO-K1 cells (CRL-9618; ATCC, Manassas, VA), WTA11 cells (a CHO-K1 cell line coexpressing mitochondrial apoaequorin and Gα16), or human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573), using FuGENE 6. The transfected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 in Nutrient Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, from 2 days after transfection. The medium of WTA11 cells contained, in addition, 250 μg/ml zeocin. The resistant clones were selected by RT-PCR and sequencing. COS-7 and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), with the pEFIN5 plasmids encoding GPR41 or GPR43. The cells were used in functional assays 2 days after transfection.Aequorin Assay—The functional response to SCFAs was analyzed by measuring the luminescence of aequorin as described previously (17Detheux M. Standker L. Vakili J. Munch J. Forssmann U. Adermann K. Pohlmann S. Vassart G. Kirchhoff F. Parmentier M. Forssmann W.G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1501-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For all assays, data were analyzed with the PRISM software (Graph-Pad Prism Software, San Diego, CA) using nonlinear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose-response model, as for all assays used in this work. cAMP Assay—CHO-K1 cells were spread on Petri dishes (250,000 cells per 35-mm dish) and cultured overnight in Nutrient Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml G418. Cells were preincubated for 30 min in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer composed of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.45 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, and 8 mm glucose and then incubated for 20 min in the same medium supplemented with 10 μm forskolin and variable concentrations of agonists. The reaction was stopped by removing the supernatant and the addition of 100 μl of lysis buffer in each well. The cAMP contents were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CS200 kit; Applied Biosystems).[35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—The measurement of agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes of cells expressing human GPR41 or human GPR43 was performed as described previously (9Kotani M. Detheux M. Vandenbogaerde A. Communi D. Vanderwinden J.M. Le Poul E. Brezillon S. Tyldesley R. Suarez-Huerta N. Vandeput F. Blanpain C. Schiffmann S.N. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34631-34636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (10 μg) from CHO-GPR41 or CHO-GPR43 cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 μm GDP, 10 μg/ml saponin) containing different concentrations of SCFA in 96-well microplates (Basic FlashPlates; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After addition of 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS, microplates were shaken for 1 min and further incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The incubation was stopped by centrifugation of the microplate for 10 min, at 800 × g and 4 °C, and removal of the supernatant. Microplates were counted in a TopCount (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 min per well.Fluorescence-based Intracellular Ca2+ Mobilization—CHO/GPR43 and CHO/GPR41 cells were seeded into black 96-well assay plates the day before the experiment. Cells are loaded for 1 h with 4 μm Fluo-3/AM (Molecular Probes) in Hank's balanced salt buffer and washed before being transferred to a microplate reader (FDSS; Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Hamamatsu, Japan) for compounds injection and simultaneous fluorescence recording for 3 min (excitation and emission wavelengths, 340 and 510 nm, respectively). Results were expressed as a percentage of fluorescence change as compared with basal level.Phosphoinositide Accumulation—Cells expressing GPR41 or GPR43 receptors were labeled overnight with 10 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol in culture medium. Cells were then washed three times and incubated in Krebs buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm d-glucose) for 15 min in medium containing1mm LiCl. SCFA agonists were then added for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by replacing the incubation medium with 1 ml of 5% HClO4. The total inositol phosphate pool was then extracted and purified on Dowex columns as described by Joly et al. (18Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed as the ratio between the radioactivity collected in the inositol phosphate fraction over the radioactivity recovered from the cellular membranes solubilized in 10% Triton and 0.1 n NaOH and used as standard. The use of this ratio allows for greater homogeneity in the data, as it reduces variations resulting from differences in cell numbers from individual wells.Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Assay—ERK1/2 activation was assayed by Western blotting, using an anti-phospho-p42/44 monoclonal antibody. Briefly, cells serum-starved for 24 h were collected and resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After stimulation of cells at the indicated time with 10 mm propionate or acetate, in the presence or not of 100 ng/ml Pertussis toxin, cells were collected by centrifugation (12.000 rpm, 3 min) and heated to 100 °C for 5 min in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4 mm EDTA, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol). For Western blot analysis, solubilized proteins corresponding to ∼6 × 106 cells were loaded onto Nupage 10% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) in a Nupage MOPS SDS running buffer. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, proteins were probed with mouse anti-phospho p42/p44 (1:1000) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology).Polymorphonuclear Cell Pharmacology: Intracellular Calcium Release and Chemotaxis Assays—Polymorphonuclear cells were purified from buffy coats of healthy volunteers. PMN chemotaxis was performed in Boyden microchambers (Neuro Probe, Gaithersburg, MD) with polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes (5-μm pore size; Corning Separations Division, Acton, MA) as described previously (19Struyf S. Proost P. Schols D. De Clercq E. Opdenakker G. Lenaerts J.P. Detheux M. Parmentier M. De Meester I. Scharpe S. Van Damme J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4903-4909PubMed Google Scholar). For intracellular Ca2+ assays, cells were incubated in Hanks' balanced salt medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 2.8 μg/ml Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were washed, resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml, and allowed to re-equilibrate for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then transferred to cuvettes, and calcium transients were monitored through fluorescence measurements using an LSB 50B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).RESULTSIdentification of GPR43 and GPR41 as Receptors for Short Chain Fatty Acids—In the frame of a general strategy for characterizing ligands for orphan G protein-coupled receptors, a CHO-K1 cell line coexpressing GPR43, Gα16, and apoaequorin (GPR43-WTA11) was established and screened in an aequorin-based functional assay against a large collection of reference compounds comprising peptides, lipids, carbohydrates, and small chemical compounds. A biological activity specific for GPR43-expressing cells was observed for a number of peptide solutions containing acetate as the counter ion. Control tests revealed that the acetate ion itself, and not the peptides, was responsible for the agonist activity on GPR43. A pH effect could rapidly be excluded, as neutral acetate buffers displayed the same activity as acetic acid. Furthermore, different salts of acetate (Na+,NH3+, and K+) confirmed the activity of the acetate anion. We also excluded that the effect of acetate on intracellular calcium release was subsequent to the acidification of the cell cytosol, as several organic acids with a similar pK a were not active on GPR43-expressing cells. This specificity of the GPR43 response to acetate was further demonstrated by testing in the same assay a set of about 60 orphan and characterized receptors belonging to different GPCR classes and subclasses, in addition to the wild-type cell lines WTA11. None of these responded to acetate. The determination of concentration-action curves allowed us to estimate the EC50 of GPR43 for sodium acetate at 268 ± 26 μm (Fig. 2A). Additional SCFAs were tested at this stage and were found to activate GPR43, as well, in the aequorin-based assay (data not shown).Fig. 2Aequorin-based functional assay of GPR41 and GPR43. CHO-K1 cell lines coexpressing apoaequorin and Gα16 (WTA11 cells) were further transfected with a bicistronic vector expressing GPR43 (A) or GPR41 (B). The selected stable clones were used in a functional assay based on the activation of aequorin, following the release of intracellular Ca2+, in response to acetate or propionate. The data represent the mean ± S.E. for triplicate data points. The displayed curves are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also screened the receptors structurally related to GPR43 and found that GPR41, which shares 42% amino acid identity with GPR43, was also activated by acetate, although to a lower extent (Fig. 2B). Indeed, the EC50 of GPR41 for acetate was estimated at 1390 ± 220 μm, and the other SCFA propionate was found to display a higher potency on this receptor, with an EC50 of 11.6 ± 1.4 μm (Fig. 2B).Intracellular Coupling of GPR41 and GPR43—The natural coupling properties and the intracellular signaling pathways activated by GPR43 and GPR41, upon stimulation by acetate or propionate, were investigated in CHO-K1 cells expressing the human receptors but devoid of aequorin or additional coupling proteins such as Gα16 (CHO/GPR43 and CHO/GPR41 cells). We first demonstrated that both receptors coupled negatively to adenylyl cyclase through a Pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (Gi/o class), while being unable to promote accumulation of cAMP in the absence of forskolin (not shown). This cAMP accumulation assay was used to characterize further the detailed pharmacology of the receptors (see Fig. 3, A and B, and see below). A [35S]GTPγS binding assay was used alternatively as a functional test to monitor Gi/o coupling of these receptors in a cell-free assay, to exclude further the possibility that cell activation would result from nonspecific actions on the cell metabolism or cytoplasmic components. The activity of acetate and propionate on GPR43 and GPR41 was confirmed in this assay (Fig. 4, A and B). Propionate was equipotent on GPR43 (EC50 = 259 ± 67 μm) and GPR41 (EC50 = 274 ± 75 μm), whereas acetate was more potent on GPR43 (EC50 = 537 ± 31 μm) than on GPR41 (EC50 = 1299 ± 65 μm). PTX treatment inhibited the response to SCFAs for both receptors. Stimulation of GPR41 and GPR43 also resulted in the release of intracellular calcium, with a similar rank order of potency (see Fig. 4, C and D and Table I). Although the EC50 values observed in both assays were similar for GPR41, they were higher in the Ca2+ assay as compared with the cAMP assay for GPR43. Furthermore, PTX abolished the response of GPR41 but not of GPR43 (Fig. 4, C and D). This suggested a unique Gi/o coupling for GPR41 and a dual coupling through the Gi/o and Gq families for GPR43.Fig. 3Pharmacology of GPR41 or GPR43 in a cAMP accumulation assay. CHO-K1 cell lines expressing GPR43 (A) or GPR41 (B) were incubated with various concentrations of SCFA and analogs, together with 5 μm forskolin.

A and B, the binding of [35S]GTPγS to membranes of CHO-K1 cells expressing GPR43 (A) or GPR41 (B) was measured following stimulation by acetate or propionate. C and D, intracellular calcium mobilization was measured in CHO-K1 cells expressing GPR43 (C) or GPR41 (D), after culturing the cells in the presence or absence of Pertussis toxin. The data represent the mean ± S.E. for triplicate data points, and the displayed curves are representative of at least three independent experiments.

Moreover, transient expression of GPR43 in COS-7 cells led to the accumulation of inositol phosphate products in a PTX-independent mechanism with an EC50 of 325 ± 36 μm for propionate and 132 ± 40 μm for acetate (Fig. 4E). Stimulation of GPR41 expressed in COS-7 cells resulted in the accumulation of inositol phosphates, only following the cotransfection of the chimeric G protein Gqi5 (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, the cotransfection of GPR43 and Gqi5 increased significantly the basal level of inositol phosphates, as compared with control conditions, or the expression of one of the plasmids alone, suggesting that GPR43 is endowed with constitutive activity (data not shown).Stimulation of GPR43 and GPR41 express"
https://openalex.org/W1974559428,"Although it is well established that reactive oxygen intermediates mediate the NF-κB activation induced by most agents, how H2O2 activates this transcription factor is not well understood. We found that treatment of human myeloid KBM-5 cells with H2O2 activated NF-κB in a dose- and time-dependent manner much as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) did but unlike TNF, H2O2 had no effect on IκBα degradation. Unexpectedly, however, like TNF-induced activation, H2O2-induced NF-κB activation was blocked by the calpain inhibitor N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, suggesting that a proteosomal pathway was involved. Although H2O2 activated IκBα kinase, it did not induce the serine phosphorylation of IκBα. Like TNF, H2O2 induced the serine phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, leading to its nuclear translocation. We found that H2O2 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα, which is needed for NF-κB activation. We present several lines of evidence to suggest that the Syk protein-tyrosine kinase is involved in H2O2-induced NF-κB activation. First, H2O2 activated Syk in KBM-5 cells; second, H2O2 failed to activate NF-κB in cells that do not express Syk protein; third, overexpression of Syk increased H2O2-induced NF-κB activation; and fourth, reduction of Syk transcription using small interfering RNA inhibited H2O2-induced NF-κB activation. We also showed that Syk induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα, which caused the dissociation, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of p65. Thus, overall, our results demonstrate that H2O2 induces NF-κB activation, not through serine phosphorylation or degradation of IκBα, but through Syk-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα Although it is well established that reactive oxygen intermediates mediate the NF-κB activation induced by most agents, how H2O2 activates this transcription factor is not well understood.

Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar). In the resting state, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through its tight association with specific inhibitory proteins, called inhibitors of NF-κB (IκB), belonging to a gene family consisting of IκBα, IκBβ, IκBϵ, IκBγ, Bcl-3, p100, and p105 (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar). On activation by agents such as TNF, IκBα is phosphorylated at serine residues 32 and 36, ubiquitinated at lysine residues 21 and 22, and degraded through the proteosomal pathway, thus exposing the nuclear localization signals on the p50-p65 heterodimer. Then p65 undergoes phosphorylation, leading to nuclear translocation and binding to a specific sequence in DNA, which in turn results in gene transcription. The phosphorylation of IκBα is catalyzed by IκBα kinase (IKK), which consists of IKK-α, IKK-β, and IKK-γ (also called NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)) (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar). Gene deletion studies have established that IKK-β is essential for NF-κB activation by TNF (2Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Google Scholar, 3Li Q. Estepa G. Memet S. Israel A. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1729-1733Crossref Google Scholar, 4Li Q. Antwerp D.V. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Google Scholar). IKK-α deletion, however, has no effect on NF-κB activation by most agents. Which kinase induces the phosphorylation of p65 is controversial, but protein kinase A, casein kinase II, IKK-α, and IKK-β have all been implicated (5Hayashi T. Sekine T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26790-26795Google Scholar, 6Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Google Scholar, 7Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol.

The phosphorylation of p65 at serine 529 has been shown to be required for the TNF-induced transcriptional activity of NF-κB (11Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated by a wide variety of agents, including all 18 members of the TNF superfamily, interleukin-1, interleukin-17, interleukin-18, lipopolysaccharide, H2O2, ceramide, phorbol esters, growth factors, UV, X-rays, and γ-radiation (12Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1053-1068Google Scholar). Whether all these agents activate NF-κB through the same pathway as described above is not clear. Certain agents activate NF-κB not through serine phosphorylation but through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα: nerve growth factor, erythropoietin, pervanadate, hypoxia, and silica (13Bui N.T. Livolsi A. Peyron J.F. Prehn J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 753-764Google Scholar, 14Digicaylioglu M. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 412: 641-647Google Scholar, 15Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1425-1430Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα by most agents does not lead to IκBα degradation. Pervanadate-induced NF-κB activation, however, leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (19Mukhopadhyay A. Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8549-8555Google Scholar). Surprisingly, UV-C-induced NF-κB activation is mediated through the degradation of IκBα that involves phosphorylation of neither serine nor the tyrosine residue of IκBα (20Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Google Scholar). Pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα blocks the TNF-induced serine phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB activation (16Singh S. Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31049-31054Google Scholar, 21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Google Scholar), indicating potential stereochemical hindrance. NF-κB activation of most agents has been shown to require the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, in studies that used either reactive oxygen intermediate quenchers, such as N-acetylcysteine, or antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, and thioredoxin (22Staal F.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Google Scholar). Additionally, there are reports that H2O2 activates NF-κB (23Kretz-Remy C. Mehlen P. Mirault M.E. Arrigo A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1083-1093Google Scholar, 24Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Google Scholar, 30Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that H2O2-induced NF-κB is blocked by N-acetylcysteine (24Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Google Scholar), how H2O2 activates NF-κB is not fully understood (31Livolsi A. Busuttil V. Imbert V. Abraham R.T. Peyron J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1508-1515Google Scholar, 32Schoonbroodt S. Ferreira V. Best-Belpomme M. Boelaert J.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4292-4300Google Scholar, 33Kamata H. Manabe T. Oka S. Kamata K. Hirata H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 231-237Google Scholar). In the present report, we investigated the mechanism of H2O2-induced NF-κB activation. We found that H2O2-induced NF-κB activation occurred without degradation of IκBα. Instead, H2O2 activated Syk protein-tyrosine kinase, which in turn induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα, leading to NF-κB activation. Reagents—Bacteria-derived human rTNF, purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5 × 107 units/mg, was kindly provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Penicillin, streptomycin, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, RPMI 1640 medium, fetal bovine serum, and LipofectAMINE 200 were obtained from Invitrogen. H2O2 was obtained from Sigma. Antibodies anti-p65, anti-p50, anti-IκBα, anti-cyclin D1, and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-specific anti-IκBα (Ser-32) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-IKK-α and anti-IKK-β antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Anti-Syk and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies were purchased from Neo markers (Fremont, CA). Antibody that recognizes the serine 529-phosphorylated form of p65 was obtained from Rockland Laboratories (Gilberts-ville, PA). Wild type Syk-cDNA as described previously (34Coopman P.J. Do M.T. Barth M. Bowden E.T. Hayes A.J. Basyuk E. Blancato J.K. Vezza P.R. McLeskey S.W. Mangeat P.H. Mueller S.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 742-747Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Susette C. Mueller (Georgetown University Medical School, Washington, D. C.). Generation of siRNA Plasmid Vector—IMG-800 (pSuppressorNeo, Imgenex, CA) vector was used for construction of 21-bp head-to-head hairpins of human Syk (GenBank™ accession number NM 003177.2, bp 153–173, 555–575, or 1443–1463). For each construction, two complementary oligonucleotides containing human Syk sequences were synthesized (MWG-Biotech, High point, NC) and annealed to generate double stranded DNAs, which were cloned into the SalI and XbaI cloning sites of IMG-800. The sequence (bp 555–575) used was TCGAGCAGACATGGAA CCTGCAGGGGAGTACTGCCCTGCAGGTTCCATGTCTGCTTTTT (sequences are in bold letter, stem loop sequences are in italics, and SalI cloning overhang site is underlined). Cell Lines—The leukemic cell line KBM-5 is phenotypically myeloid with monocytic differentiation. The cell lines Jurkat (human T cells), JCaM1 (p56lck and p72syk deficient), human breast cancer cells MCF-7, human lung cancer cells H1299 and mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from the American Tissue and Cell Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). JCaM1 cells transfected with the p56lck gene were kindly supplied by Dr. Arthur Weiss (The University of California, San Francisco, CA). The characterization of these cells has been previously reported (35Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Google Scholar). KBM-5 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum; Jurkat and JCaM1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—To determine NF-κB activation, we performed EMSA as described (36Chaturvedi M.M. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 319: 585-602Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells (2 × 106/ml) were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (10 μg of protein with 16 fmol of DNA) from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat, 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (boldface indicates NF-κB binding sites) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide, 5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined by competition with the unlabeled oligonucleotide. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with antibodies against either p50 or p65 of NF-κB for 30 min at 37 °C before the complex was analyzed by EMSA. Antibodies against cyclin D1 and preimmune serum were included as negative controls. The dried gels were visualized, and radioactive bands quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuant software. Western Blot Analysis—To determine the levels of protein expression in cytoplasm or nuclear extracts, we prepared each extract (37Majumdar S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2911-2920Google Scholar) from TNF-treated cells and fractionated them by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody, and detected by ECL regent (Amersham Biosciences). The density of the bands was measured using a personal densitometer scan v1.30 and ImageQuant software version 3.3 (Amersham Biosciences). IκBα Kinase Assay—The IKK assay was performed by a method described previously (38Manna S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4927-4934Google Scholar). Briefly, IKK complex from cytoplasm was precipitated with antibody against IKK-α, followed by treatment with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). After a 2-h incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and then assayed in kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μg of substrate GST-IκBα-(1–54). After the immunocomplex was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized by PhosphorImager. To determine the total amounts of IKK-α and IKK-β in each sample, 30 μg of the cytoplasmic protein was resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with either anti-IKK-α or anti-IKK-β antibodies. Syk Kinase Assay—To examine the activity of protein-tyrosine kinase Syk induced by H2O2, we immunoprecipitated with anti-Syk antibody, and then performed the in vitro kinase assay using the GST-IκBα-(1–54) as the substrate. Briefly, cells were pretreated with 100 μg/ml ALLN (to prevent proteolytic degradation; Ref. 39Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1053-1062Google Scholar) for 1 h, then stimulated with H2O2 for 5 min and whole cell extracts were prepared in the lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm EDTA). The kinase protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-Syk antibody, followed by protein A/G-Sepharose beads. After 2 h, the beads were washed with the lysis buffer and assayed in a kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm MgCl2,5mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 5 μg of substrate GST-IκBα-(1–54)) and [γ-32P]ATP. After 30 min incubation at 30 °C, the samples were boiled with SDS sample buffer for 5 min, then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (10% SDS-PAGE), and the dried gels were visualized, and radioactive bands quantitated by a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα by Syk was also determined by using unlabeled ATP in the kinase reaction mixture as described above, and then performing Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Nuclear Localization of p65 NF-κB by Immunocytochemistry—The effect of H2O2 on the nuclear translocation of p65 was examined by the immunocytochemical method as described (40Vinitsky A. Michaud C. Powers J.C. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9421-9428Google Scholar). Briefly, treated cells were plated on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide by centrifugation using a cytospin 4 (Thermoshendon, Pittsburg, PA), air-dried, fixed with cold acetone, and permeabilized with 0.2% of Triton X-100. After being washed in phosphate-buffered saline, slides were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human p65 or IκBα antibodies at 1:100 dilutions. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the slides were washed, incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:100 dilutions for 1 h, and counterstained for nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (50 ng/ml) for 5 min. Stained slides were mounted with mounting medium purchased from Sigma and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pictures were captured using Photometrics Coolsnap CF color camera (Nikon, Lewisville, TX) and MetaMorph version 4.6.5 software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Immunoprecipitation Assays—Cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in whole cell extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysate containing 500 μg of proteins in extraction buffer was incubated with 1 μg/ml concentration of antibodies overnight. Immunocomplex was precipitated using protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with extraction buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and fractionated in SDS-PAGE. Syk-siRNA and Syk-cDNA Transfection—To determine the role of Syk protein-tyrosine kinase in the H2O2-induced NF-κB activation, 2 × 105 cells were transfected either with small interfering RNA-Syk (siRNA-Syk), or with wild type-Syk cDNA (Syk-WT). Two μg of plasmid in each case was diluted in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without serum and antibiotics), and then mixed with 200 μlof Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000. This mixture was added to the cells and incubated for 4 h. After incubation, medium was changed into RPMI 1640 and maintained for an additional 48 h. These cells were then used to examine the expression of Syk protein by Western blot analysis, NF-κB activity by EMSA, and Syk activity by the kinase assay as described above. In this report we investigated the effect of H2O2 on NF-κB activation, IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, p65 phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation, and the role of protein-tyrosine kinase Syk in H2O2-induced NF-κB activation. Because NF-κB activation by TNF is well understood, we used TNF as a control for most studies. As determined by trypan blue dye exclusion and Hoechst staining methods, the treatment of cells with 500 μm H2O2 for 2 h had no significant effect on cell viability (viability was greater than 98%). Both H2O2and TNF Activate DNA Binding Activity of NF-κB in a Dose- and Time-dependent Manner—To determine the effect of H2O2 on the activation of NF-κB, KBM-5 cells were treated with different concentrations of H2O2 for 120 min or TNF for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared for analysis of NF-κB activation by EMSA. Both H2O2 and TNF induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner in KBM-5 cells (Fig. 1A); maximum activation with H2O2 occurred at 500 μm. NF-κB was activated by both agents in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). TNF induced NF-κB activation within 15 min, and activation continued for 240 min, whereas, H2O2-induced NF-κB activation started at 60 min, reached maximum at 120 min, and then decreased at 240 min. The maximum TNF-induced NF-κB activation was 14-fold; with H2O2 it was 3–7-fold. Thus, H2O2 induced NF-κB activation more slowly than did TNF. The slower kinetics and difference in the optimum level of activation suggest that the mechanism of NF-κB activation by H2O2 is different from that of TNF. Because NF-κB is a complex of proteins, various combinations of Rel/NF-κB protein can constitute an active NF-κB heterodimer that binds to a specific sequence in DNA (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar). To show that the retarded band visualized by EMSA in H2O2-treated cells was indeed NF-κB, we incubated nuclear extracts from H2O2-stimulated cells with antibodies to either the p50 (NF-κB1) or the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-κB. Both shifted the band to a higher molecular mass (Fig. 1C), thus suggesting that the H2O2-activated complex consisted of p50 and p65 subunits. Neither preimmune serum nor anti-cyclin D1 antibody had any effect. Excess unlabeled NF-κB (100-fold) caused complete disappearance of the band, and a mutant oligonucleotide of NF-κB did not affect NF-κB binding activity. H2O2Induces NF-κB Activation without Degrading IκBα— TNF-induced NF-κB activation requires the degradation of IκBα (for references see Ref. 1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar). Whether H2O2-induced NF-κB activation is also mediated through IκBα degradation was investigated. To determine this, cells were treated with 0.1 nm TNF or 500 μm H2O2 for the indicated times, extracted the cytoplasmic protein, and analyzed for IκBα on 10% SDS-PAGE using anti-IκBα antibody. TNF induced IκBα degradation within 15 min after treatment, and IκBα was resynthesized at 60 min (Fig. 2A). However, H2O2 did not induce IκBα degradation at any time points. TNF Induces IκB Serine Phosphorylation but H2O2Does Not—TNF induces phosphorylation of serines 32 and 36 of IκBα (for references see Ref. 1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar). So we investigated whether H2O2 induces serine phosphorylation of IκBα. To stabilize the phosphorylated IκBα, we blocked degradation of IκBα using the proteosome inhibitor ALLN (39Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1053-1062Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using phospho-specific anti-IκBα antibody (Fig. 2B) showed that TNF induced the phosphorylation of IκBα but H2O2 had no effect on the serine phosphorylation of IκBα. ALLN Inhibits NF-κB Activation Induced by Both TNF and H2O2—ALLN blocked not only TNF-induced NF-κB activation, but also H2O2-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2C). Thus IκBα phosphorylation and degradation are critical in TNF-induced NF-κB activation. H2O2Induces Translocation and Phosphorylation of p65—We analyzed the effect of TNF and H2O2 on translocation and phosphorylation of p65 by Western blot analysis. Both TNF and H2O2 induced nuclear translocation of p65 in a time-dependent manner. On TNF stimulation, p65 nuclear translocation reached maximum 15 min after TNF treatment and gradually declined thereafter. In the case of H2O2, p65 translocation was slightly induced after 15 min treatment, peaked at 60 min, and diminished thereafter (Fig. 3A). Both TNF and H2O2 induced the phosphorylation of p65 in a time-dependent manner, but the kinetics of H2O2-induced phosphorylation of p65 was slower than that for TNF (Fig. 3B). Immunocytochemistry assay showed that while in untreated cells, p65 was localized primarily in the cytoplasm, TNF and H2O2 induced translocation of p65 into the nucleus (Fig. 3C). However, H2O2-induced phosphorylation and translocation of p65 to the nucleus were delayed compared with TNF-induced response. H2O2Induces IκBα Kinase Activation—Because our results indicated that H2O2-induced NF-κB activation is not mediated through the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, we next explored whether H2O2 can activate IKK. It has been shown that IKK is required not only for TNF-induced phosphorylation of IκBα but also for the phosphorylation of p65 (9Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Google Scholar, 10Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3863-3869Google Scholar). An in vitro immune complex kinase assay using GST-IκBα-(1–54) as the substrate showed that both TNF and H2O2 activated IKK as early as 5 min after TNF treatment, but then activation ceased (Fig. 4). H2O2-induced IKK activation was, however, weaker than that induced by TNF. Neither TNF nor H2O2 had any effect on the expression of either IKK-α or IKK-β proteins. These results suggest that H2O2 activated IKK but had no effect on the serine phosphorylation of IκBα. H2O2Does Not Activate NF-κB in Syk-deficient Jurkat Cells—To investigate further the role of Syk in H2O2-induced NF-κB activation, we used JCaM1 cells known to lack both Lck (35Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Google Scholar) and Syk protein expression (41Willebrand V.M. Williams S. Tailor S. Mustelin T. Cell Signalling. 1998; 10: 407-413Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that Jurkat cells expressed Syk protein but JCaM1 cells expressed very little or no Syk (Fig. 5A). The anti-Syk antibody was specific as it did not recognize Lck protein expression in p56lck-reconstituted JCaM1 cells (Fig. 5A). TNF activated NF-κB in both Jurkat and JCaM1 cells and induced IκBα degradation in both the cell lines (Fig. 5B). The kinetics of TNF-induced NF-κB activation, however, was slightly slower in JCaM1 cells than in Jurkat cells (15 versus 30 min) and the overall magnitude of activation was also lower (7.1-versus 5.1-fold). In contrast, H2O2 activated NF-κB in Jurkat cells but not in JCaM1 cells (Fig. 5C), indicating an essential role of Syk protein expression in H2O2-induced activation. We also investigated the ability of H2O2 to activate NF-κB in human lung epithelial (H1299) and breast epithelial (MCF-7) cells, which cannot be activated for Syk (Fig. 5D, lower panel). H1299 and MCF-7 cells were treated with H2O2 for the indicated times, nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed for NF-κB activation by EMSA. Whole cell extracts were analyzed for Syk activation. We found that H2O2 failed to activate Syk and this correlated with the lack of activation of NF-κB in H1299 and MCF-7 cells. Whether H2O2 can activate NF-κB in murine cells was examined. For this murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells were treated for the indicated times with 500 μm H2O2 and then examined for NF-κB activation by EMSA and IκBα degradation by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5E, H2O2 induced NF-κB activation in murine cells and this was accompanied with the degradation and resynthesis of IκBα. These results agree with a previous report (32Schoonbroodt S. Ferreira V. Best-Belpomme M. Boelaert J.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4292-4300Google Scholar) but differ from that noted in human cells. H2O2Does Not Activate NF-κB in Lck-reconstituted JCaM1 Cells—JCaM1 cells have been shown to lack both p56lck and Syk protein-tyrosine kinases (35Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that p56lck is required for ceramide-induced and HIV-tat-induced NF-κB activation (42Manna S.K. Sah N.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13297-13306Google Scholar, 43Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5166Google Scholar). EMSA of JCaM1 cells whose p56lck expression had been reconstituted revealed that H2O2 activated NF-κB in Jurkat cells but not in JCaM1 cells whose p56lck expression had been reconstituted (Fig. 5F). No IκBα phosphorylation was noted in either of the cell lines (see lower panel). In other words, p56lck was not required for H2O2-induced NF-κB activation or for IκBα phosphorylation. H2O2Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Syk Protein in Jurkat Cells but Not in JCaM1 Cells—Jurkat and Syk-deficient JCaM1 cells treated with H2O2 for the indicated times were immunoprecipitated with anti-Syk antibody and then subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10)"
https://openalex.org/W2000556566,"Congestive heart failure is accompanied by increased cardiac brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene expression with elevated plasma concentrations of BNP and its precursor, proBNP. We investigated if myocardial ischemia in the absence of overt heart failure may be another mechanism for increased myocardial BNP expression. The BNP expression was examined in hypoxic myocardium of patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting surgery, in patients with coronary artery disease and normal left ventricular function undergoing percutaneous transluminal intervention therapy, and in heart failure patients without coronary artery disease. BNP mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR, and plasma BNP and proBNP concentrations were measured with radioimmunoassays. Quantitative analysis of BNP mRNA in atrial and ventricular biopsies from coronary bypass grafting patients revealed close associations of plasma BNP and proBNP concentrations to ventricular, but not atrial, BNP mRNA levels. Plasma BNP and proBNP concentrations were markedly increased in patients with coronary artery disease but without concomitant left ventricular dysfunction. These results are compatible with the notion that myocardial ischemia, even in the absence of left ventricular dysfunction, augments cardiac BNP gene expression and increases plasma BNP and proBNP concentrations. Thus, elevated BNP and proBNP concentrations do not necessarily reflect heart failure but may also result from cardiac ischemia."

In the nucleus, not only is the DNA methylated, but the methylated DNA is also interpreted by methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins. MBD1 possesses an MBD involved in mediating DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional repression. The MBD of MBD1 binds a symmetrically methylated CpG sequence, but the precise roles of this domain have not been investigated. In addition, little is understood about the state of histone modifications within MBD1-containing heterochromatin on methylated gene promoters. Here we show that histone H3 methylase Suv39h1 and the methyl lysine-binding protein HP1 directly interact with MBD of MBD1 in vitro and in cells. Suv39h1 was found to enhance MBD1-mediated transcriptional repression via MBD but not via the C-terminal transcriptional repression domain of MBD1. Furthermore, MBD1 links to histone deacetylases through Suv39h1, resulting in methylation and deacetylation of histones for gene inactivation.

DNA and protein modifications create a new surface for interaction with target molecules (1Richards E.J. Elgin S.C. Cell. 2002; 108: 489-500Google Scholar, 2Zhang Y. Reinberg D.

Cytosine methylation is involved in gene regulation and the formation of transcriptionally inactive chromatin, together with methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBD 1The abbreviations used are: MBD, methyl-CpG binding domain; TRD, transcriptional repression domain; TSA, trichostatin A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTBP, dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate-2HCl; HA, hemagglutinin A; NLS, nuclear localization signal; HDAC, histone deacetylase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. proteins) (6Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Google Scholar, 7Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Google Scholar). There are at least five mammalian MBD proteins, namely MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, and MBD3 for transcriptional repression, and MBD4 (also known as MED1) for mismatch repair as a thymine glycosylase. In addition, posttranslational modifications of amino termini of the core histones cooperatively produce epigenetic codes for genome dynamics in the nucleus. These include acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation of the histone molecules. Recent studies of cytosine hypomethylation mutants have revealed that both DNA methylation and histone modifications share a common pathway in chromatin organization (8Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Google Scholar). The Neurospora crassa DIM-5 gene product is a histone H3 methylase containing a SET domain, which specifically methylates lysine 9 of histone H3, abbreviated throughout as H3 (Lys-9). The mutant dim-5 completely abolished cytosine methylation of the genome. Furthermore, Arabidopsis thaliana DDM1, which shows amino acid similarity to a helicase of the SWI2/SNF2 family, is also required for the maintenance of genomic methylation (9Jeddeloh J.A. Stokes T.L. Richards E.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 94-97Google Scholar), and disruption of the homolog Lsh gene caused demethylation of the mouse genome (10Dennis K. Fan T. Geiman T. Yan Q. Muegge K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2940-2944Google Scholar). These suggest that DNA methylation may depend on methyl-H3 (Lys-9) and unique chromatin structure. However, interrelations between cytosine methylation, MBD proteins, and the histone-modifying system remain to be elucidated (1Richards E.J. Elgin S.C. Cell. 2002; 108: 489-500Google Scholar, 3Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar, 11Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 198-209Google Scholar). MBD1 is known to act as a transcriptional repressor through the cooperation of MBD, cysteine-rich CXXC domains, and a C-terminal transcriptional repression domain (TRD) (12Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Google Scholar, 13Ng H.H. Jeppesen P. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Google Scholar, 14Fujita N.

The conserved CXXC sequence was originally found in DNMT1 and the trithorax group protein ALL-1, but its precise role is unknown (12Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Google Scholar, 15Cross S.H. Meehan R.R. Nan X. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 256-259Google Scholar). MBD1 produces an active transcriptional repression that was partially reversed by the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (13Ng H.H. Jeppesen P. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Google Scholar). During investigation of the mechanism of transcriptional repression by the TRD of MBD1, we have recently found that a transcriptional mediator, MBD1-containing chromatin associated factor (MCAF), binds the TRD of MBD1 to form the repressive complex (16Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Google Scholar). In addition, the MBD of MBD1 binds a symmetrically methylated CpG sequence (17Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Jee J. Ikegami T. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. Cell. 2001; 105: 487-497Google Scholar), but transcriptional roles of this domain have not been investigated. Little is understood about the state of histone modifications within MBD1-containing heterochromatin on methylated gene promoters. In this study, we show that H3 (Lys-9) methylase Suv39h1 and the methyl lysine-binding protein HP1 interact with MBD of MBD1. Suv39h1 enhances MBD1-mediated transcriptional repression via MBD but not the C-terminal TRD of MBD1. Furthermore, MBD1 associates with histone deacetylases through Suv39h1. Our data suggest that MBD1 tethers the Suv39h1-HP1 complex to methylated DNA regions. We discuss the possible pathway from DNA methylation to the modifications of histones for epigenetic gene regulation. Cell Culture, Transfection, Treatment, and Luciferase Assay—HeLa, U2OS, NCI-H1299, and SBC5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker). The cells transfected by a liposome-mediated gene transfer were treated with 100 ng/ml of trichostatin A (TSA) or 1 mm sodium n-butyrate (Wako) for 12 h. The luciferase activities were determined as described (12Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Google Scholar, 16Fujita N.

The cDNA for Suv39h1 was inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pCMV-GAL4 (GAL4 mock). The cDNA for HP1α was inserted into pcDNA3. The cDNA for MBD1v3 was ligated into pcDNA3 and pDsRed-N1 (Clontech). Chemical Cross-linking and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—Cells (5 × 105) were treated for 30 min on ice with dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate-2HCl (DTBP) (5 mm) (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline and then with the addition of 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Crude cell lysates were sonicated to generate DNA fragments 200–1000 bp in length. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG, anti-HP1α, and anti-Pol II antibodies or control IgG. Specific sequences for the p16 gene promoter in the immunoprecipitates were detected by PCR amplification with the p16-W primers (14Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Google Scholar). Protein Expression—The full-length (amino acids 1–605) sequence and the MBD (1–84), CXXC1 (174–220), CXXC2 (221–327), CXXC3 (328–379), and TRD (529–592) of MBD1v1 cDNA were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The full-length (1–412) sequence and Δ1 (1–88), Δ2 (89–254), and Δ3 (255–412) of Suv39h1 were also inserted to pGEX-4T-1. The full-length cDNA for HP1α (1–191) was cloned into pRSET (Invitrogen). In Vitro Translation and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down—Plasmid DNA (1 μg) was used for in vitro transcription and translation (50 μl) according to the manufacturer (Promega). Bacterially expressed GST and GST-fused proteins (2 μg) were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with either whole lysates from HeLa cells, in vitro translated proteins, or His-tagged proteins (2 μg) in a buffer (250 μl) containing 0.1% TritonX-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50–300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors for1hat4 °C. The input indicates 5% of HeLa cell lysates, in vitro translated and His-tagged proteins, in the reaction mixture. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cell lysates were incubated with specific antibodies or control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. This was followed by incubation for 1 h after adding 30 μl of protein G/A agarose beads (Oncogene) in a buffer (250 μl) containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. The immunoprecipitations of endogenous methyl-H3 (lysine 9) and FLAG-MBD1 and endogenous MBD1 and HP1α in HeLa cells were performed after cross-linking with DTBP. The input indicates 5% of HeLa cell lysates. Antibodies, Western Blot, and Immunofluorescence Analyses—Polyclonal antibodies against HP1α (amino acids 1–191) were generated by immunizing rats against the His-tagged HP1α. For affinity purification of the antibodies, GST-fused HP1α (1–191) was coupled to an Affi-Gel activated matrix (Bio-Rad). Anti-MBD1 antibodies were generated previously (16Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Google Scholar) or purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies utilized were anti-histone deacetylase 1 (anti-HDAC1; H-51), anti-HDAC2 (C-8), anti-RNA polymerase II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (M5) (Sigma), anti-His (Qiagen), anti-hemagglutinin 1 (HA) (Roche Applied Science), and anti-dimethyl-histone H3 (lysine 9) antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology). Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses were carried out as described (12Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Google Scholar). Localization of MBD1, Suv39h1, G9a, and HP1α in the Nucleus—To address the mechanism(s) of transcriptional repression by MBD1, we considered whether MBD1 can associate with histone methylases such as Suv39h1 and G9a by using an immunofluorescence analysis in HeLa cells (Fig. 1). Previous reports clarified that the subnuclear localization of MBD1 depends on the genome methylation (12Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Google Scholar, 14Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Google Scholar). Fluorescent protein-fused Suv39h1 and MBD1 showed a similar punctate distribution with multiple foci in the nuclei except for nucleolus (Fig. 1A). In contrast, MBD1 did not preferably colocalize with G9a (Fig. 1B), emphasizing the specific correlation between MBD1 and Suv39h1. As previous reports demonstrated that Suv39h1 associates with HP1α (19Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Google Scholar, 20Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Google Scholar), MBD1 was also found to mostly coexist with HP1α (Fig. 1C). Because Suv39h1 selectively methylates H3 (Lys-9), we further observed the existence of methyl-H3 (Lys-9) and MBD1 in the nucleus. The methyl-H3 (Lys-9) proteins concentrated on multiple foci with intense staining of MBD1 (data not shown). Almost all the nuclei observed exhibited the patterns shown here. The observation suggested that MBD1 associates with Suv39h1-HP1 on both methyl-H3 (Lys-9) and methylated DNA-containing regions. To investigate the localization of these proteins on chromosomal gene promoters, we chose the p16 tumor suppressor gene in which hypermethylation of the promoter-associated CpG island associates with transcriptional repression in many cancers (21Baylin S.B. Esteller M. Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Schuebel K. Herman J.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 687-692Google Scholar, 22Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 461-467Google Scholar). NCI-H1299 cells possessed a methylated p16 promoter; meanwhile, the same DNA region was unmethylated in SBC-5 cells (14Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Google Scholar, 16Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Google Scholar). After the cells expressing FLAG-tagged MBD1 or Suv39h1 were cross-linked with dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate-2HCl and formaldehyde, the coprecipitated DNAs with appropriate antibodies were subjected to PCR-amplification using a set of primers for p16 promoter sequences (Fig. 1D). MBD1 and Suv39h1 were present on the methylated but not the unmethylated p16 promoter. Using the untransfected cells, HP1α was also found in the methylated promoter. In contrast, RNA polymerase II-containing complexes associated exclusively with the unmethylated p16 promoter in SBC-5 cells. These results suggested that MBD1 coexists with the Suv39h1-HP1 heterochromatic complex and may tether it to methylated DNA regions for establishing histone methylation. MBD1 Interacts with Suv39h1-HP1α Complex via MBD—To address the molecular interaction between MBD1 and the Suv39h1-HP1 complex, we performed an immunoprecipitation analysis in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). FLAG-Suv39h1 was detected in the immunoprecipitates with HA-fused MBD1. Likewise, MBD1 was present in the Suv39h1-immunoprecipitates. To identify the direct interaction between MBD1 and Suv39h1, in vitro pull-down analysis was carried out (Fig. 2B). GST and GST-fused portions of MBD1 were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with in vitro translated FLAG-Suv39h1. Full-length MBD1 bound Suv39h1. Interestingly, Suv39h1 was found to selectively bind the MBD but not the cysteine-rich CXXC domains or the C-terminal TRD of the MBD1 protein. In agreement with this data, an immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the HA-ΔN MBD1 mutant, which was deleted for N-terminal MBD (amino acids 1–61), lost the binding ability to FLAG-Suv39h1 (Fig. 2C). To map the region of Suv39h1 that interacts with MBD1, GST-fused portions of Suv39h1 were utilized for a pull-down analysis of in vitro translated FLAG-MBD1 (Fig. 2D). MBD1 associated with a middle part of Suv39h1 (Δ2), termed the PreSET region, which is located between the chromo domain (Δ1) and the C-terminal SET catalytic domain (Δ3). This result indicated the presence of an MBD1-interacting domain in Suv39h1. Next, we investigated whether HP1α participates in the MBD1-containing complex, using an immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 2E). Endogenous HP1α was found in the immunoprecipitates with FLAG-MBD1, and MBD1 was present in the HP1α-immunoprecipitates. To evaluate the direct interaction of MBD1 with HP1α, bacterially expressed proteins were used for in vitro pull-down analysis (Fig. 2F). GST-fused Suv39h1 or parts of MBD1 on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with His-tagged HP1α. Both full-length Suv39h1 and MBD1 complexed with HP1α. Significantly, the MBD of MBD1, but not the CXXC domains or TRD, bound HP1α. Thus, the data in Fig. 2, B, C, and F evidently suggested that MBD is an interacting surface to Suv39h1-HP1α. We further examined the association of these endogenous proteins in HeLa cells without any overexpression (Fig. 2G). The band that reacted to anti-HP1α antibodies was concentrated in the MBD1 immunoprecipitates. Endogenous MBD1 and HP1α were also colocalized in the nucleus, indicating the existence of complexes containing both proteins in vivo. Because HP1 tethers Suv39h1 to methyl-H3 (Lys-9), we tested whether MBD1 associates with methyl-H3 (Lys-9) by using immunoprecipitation. FLAG-MBD1 was detected in the immune complexes with endogenous methyl-H3 (Lys-9), and methyl-H3 (Lys-9) was also present in the MBD1-immunoprecipitates (data not shown). To examine whether the MBD in MBD1 tethers the Suv39h1-HP1 complex to methylated DNA regions in the nucleus, immunofluorescence analyses of fluorescent protein-fused Suv39h1, HP1α, and MBD1 (MBD+NLS), which includes only the MBD and nuclear localization signal (NLS) of MBD1, as well as FLAG-ΔN MBD1 were performed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2H). As described above, the punctate distribution of MBD1 with multiple foci depends on the presence of N-terminal MBD in proportion to genome methylation (12Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Google Scholar, 14Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Google Scholar). The MBD1 (MBD+NLS) showed multiple foci formation in the interphase nuclei and colocalized with both Suv39h1 and HP1α. On the other hand, ΔN MBD1 was found to be present throughout the nuclei, and both Suv39h1 and HP1α localized into differently characteristic foci in the nuclei. Ectopic expression of MBD1 (MBD+NLS) altered the localization of Suv39h1 and HP1α, suggesting that MBD of MBD1 is likely to recruit Suv39h1-HP1 complex to methylated DNA sites. However, our data do not exclude the possibility that Suv39h1-HP1 recruits MBD1 to H3 (Lys-9)-methylated chromatin. Suv39h1 Enhances MBD1-dependent Transcriptional Repression—Throughout our study in vivo, we chose the use of the splice isoform v3 of MBD1 (shown in Fig. 3A), because this isoform most clearly exhibits DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing (12Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Google Scholar, 14Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Google Scholar). The protein structure of isoforms MBD1v1 and v3 is identical except for the presence of CXXC3 in MBD1v1 (Fig. 2B), and the CXXC3 itself seems to have some DNA binding activities. We investigated whether Suv39h1 is involved in MBD1-mediated transcriptional silencing. As reported previously (12Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Google Scholar), the MBD of MBD1 moderately reduced methylated promoter activities, either by promoter occupation through the contact between MBD and methylated DNA or by unidentified mechanisms. To avoid the possibility of the promoter occupation, we utilized GAL4-fused portions of MBD1v3 (MBD1Δ7 (MBD, amino acids 1–61), MBD1Δ4 (CXXC1 and 2, amino acids 62–327), and MBD1Δ11 (TRD, amino acids 460–523)) and examined their effects on a Photinus pyralis luciferase reporter that contains five GAL4 binding elements (5× GAL4) just upstream of the human SNRPN gene promoter in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). A Western blot analysis showed that GAL4-fused MBD1 proteins were equally expressed in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). MBD1Δ11 strongly repressed transcription (Fig. 3A, hatched bars), whereas MBD1Δ7 moderately suppressed promoter activities (Fig. 3A, gray bars). In contrast, MBD1Δ4 did not repress transcription (Fig. 3A, black bars). Very similar results were obtained with another CpG island-associated promoter from the VHL gene (data not shown). Next, Suv39h1 is known to function as a transcriptional corepressor (23Vandel L. Nicolas E. Vaute O. Ferreira R. Ait-Si-Ali S. Trouche D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6484-6494Google Scholar, 24Nielsen S.J. Schneider R. Bauer U.M. Bannister A.J. Morrison A. O'Carroll D. Firestein R. Cleary M. Jenuwein T. Herrera R.E. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 412: 561-565Google Scholar). To confirm whether Suv39h1 affects transcription, we expressed GAL4-fused Suv39h1 in HeLa cells to test the effect of this protein on 5× GAL4-containing the SNRPN and VHL promoters (Fig. 3B). Suv39h1 inhibited both promoter activities in a dose-dependent manner. The efficiency of repression by Suv39h1 seemed to be similar to that of MBD1 by MBD. The GAL4-Suv39h1 was also expressed in proportion to the amount of transfected plasmid (data not shown). Furthermore, we examined whether Suv39h1 can affect transcriptional repression by MBD1 (Fig. 3C). FLAG-Suv39h1 and GAL4-fused portions of MBD1 were expressed in HeLa cells together with the 5× GAL4-containing promoter-driven luciferase vectors. The luciferase activity, in combination with FLAG mock, was normalized to 100 (Fig. 3C, leftmost bar), and Suv39h1 alone mildly repressed transcription from both promoters. GAL-fused MBD1Δ7 and MBD1Δ11 were appropriately expressed to repress transcription to 60–80%. Importantly, Suv39h1 synergistically enhanced the repression by MBD1Δ7, but not by MBD1Δ11, in a dose-dependent manner. No additive effect of Suv39h1 was found in the expression of GAL4 mock and MBD1Δ4. In addition, the FLAG-Suv39h1 active mutant (H320R) (25Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.-W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Google Scholar) enhanced repression by GAL-MBD1Δ7 more than was the case with the wild-type Suv39h1 (data not shown). These data supported the idea that Suv39h1 contributes to transcriptional repression by MBD1. MBD1 Links to Histone Deacetylases via Suv39h1—HDAC inhibitors such as TSA partially relieved the transcriptional repression by MBD1 (13Ng H.H. Jeppesen P. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Google Scholar). In addition, the N terminus of Suv39h1 was found to physically interact with HDAC1 and HDAC2, leading to formation of transcriptionally inactive chromatin (26Vaute O. Nicolas E. Vandel L. Trouche D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 475-481Google Scholar). Repression by GAL4-Suv39h1 was partly reversed by the HDAC inhibitors TSA and sodium n-butyrate (Fig. 4A, hatched and gray bars, respectively) in comparison with the solvent alone (Fig. 4A, black bars). To examine the interaction of MBD1 and Suv39h1 with HDAC1/HDAC2, in vitro pull-down and subsequent Western blot analyses were carried out with the indicated antibodies. Suv39h1, MBD, and TRD of MBD1 in a GST fusion were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with the cell lysates from HeLa cells. Suv39h1 and MBD of MBD1 bound both endogenous HDAC1 and HDAC2 (Fig. 4B, top two panels). The association between MBD1 and HDAC1/HDAC2 appeared to be indirect, because Suv39h1, but not MBD, bound in vitro translated HA-tagged HDAC1/HDAC2 (Fig. 4B, bottom two panels). Immunoprecipitation analyses further showed that HDAC1/HDAC2 were present in both FLAG-tagged Suv39h1 and MBD1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the use of ΔN MBD1 and control IgG failed to immunoprecipitate the HDAC1/HDAC2. Finally, we studied the effect of HDAC inhibitors on transcriptional repression by MBD and TRD of MBD1 (Fig. 4D). The repression by MBD was partially reversed by both TSA (Fig. 4D, hatched bars) and sodium n-butyrate (Fig. 4D, gray bars). In agreement with a recent study conducted under the same experimental conditions (16Fujita N. Watanabe S. Ichimura T. Ohkuma Y. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2834-2843Google Scholar), these inhibitors appeared to have less effect on transcriptional inhibition of MBD1 by TRD. Collectively, these data suggest that MBD1 promotes both methylation and deacetylation of histones on methylated genomic regions through interaction with Suv39h1-HP1 and HDACs. In this study, we report that Suv39h1 and HP1α interact with MBD1. Suv39h1 enhanced MBD1-mediated transcriptional repression via MBD but not via the C-terminal TRD of MBD1. Furthermore, MBD1 associated with histone deacetylases probably through Suv39h1. Our data suggest the possibility that MBD1 tethers the Suv39h1-HP1α complex to methylated DNA regions. Several transcription repression complexes include the deacetylases and methylases of histone molecules (1Richards E.J. Elgin S.C. Cell. 2002; 108: 489-500Google Scholar, 2Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Google Scholar, 3Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar, 4Wade P.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1131-1137Google Scholar, 5Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P.

Hypermethylated DNA usually tends to coexist with hypoacetylated histones and methyl-H3 (Lys-9) on the heterochromatic regions. In fact, MeCP2 and MBD2 interact with a co-repressor complex Sin3 containing HDACs. MBD2-MBD3 heterodimer recruits another multifunctional complex, Mi2-NuRD, which possesses both HDAC and chromatin-remodeling activities. This combination of Mi2-NuRD and MBD2 may be synonymous with the originally designated MeCP1 complex. Nevertheless, trichostatin A has been found to partially relieve transcriptional repression by MeCP2 and MBD2. Furthermore, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) represses E2F-mediated transcription through interaction not only with histone deacetylases but also with Suv39h1 (27Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Google Scholar, 28Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A.

Recent reports have shown that MeCP2 blocks transcription both by recruiting HDACs or an unidentified histone methylase at the promoter (30Fuks F. Hurd P.J. Wolf D. Nan X. Bird A.P. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4035-4040Google Scholar). Our data demonstrated that MBD1 represses transcription together with Suv39h1-HP1α complexes. In agreement with this, both MBD1 and Suv39h1-HP1α are found in the pericentromeric heterochromatin, which includes H3 (Lys-9) methylation on the methylated DNA region (1Richards E.J. Elgin S.C. Cell. 2002; 108: 489-500Google Scholar, 14Fujita N. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Kudo S. Chiba T. Saya H. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6415-6426Google Scholar). Although H3 (Lys-9) is known to be methylated by Suv39h and G9a, certain histone methylases may be able to methylate the lysine 9. In fact, double knockouts of both Suv39h1 and h2 in mouse did not reduce the level of overall H3 (Lys-9) methylation (25Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.-W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Google Scholar). We do not exclude the possibility that MBD1 can cooperate with other histone methylases and chromatin regulators. We have characterized the solution structure of MBD of MBD1 that binds a symmetrically methylated CpG dinucleotide, resulting in identification of the amino acid residues important for recognizing a methyl-CpG pair (12Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5107-5118Google Scholar, 17Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Jee J. Ikegami T. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. Cell. 2001; 105: 487-497Google Scholar). Our present study, however, revealed that the MBD of MBD1 also interacts with Suv39h1 and HP1α, leading to the direct link between DNA methylation and histone methylation. Boeke et al. (31Boeke J. Ammerpohl O. Kegel S. Moehren U. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34963-34967Google Scholar) showed that the minimal repression domain of MBD2b, which is another member of MBD-containing family, overlaps with its MBD and directly binds Sin3A, a component of the HDAC complexes. The lines of evidence suggest that MBD itself is actively involved in the interaction with target proteins for transcriptional repression. Furthermore, MBD1 is likely to establish and/or maintain the repressive state by recruiting HDAC1/HDAC2 as well as the Suv39h1-HP1α heterochromatin complex, suggesting that both methylation and deacetylation of histones coexist in the MBD1-containing chromatin on methylated DNAs. MBD1 would provide the chance for methylating core histones in the methylated DNA regions, as some MBD proteins connect cytosine methylation to histone deacetylation (7Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Google Scholar, 32Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Google Scholar, 33Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Google Scholar). In other words, all cytosine methylation may not be simply downstream of histone methylation. The localization of Suv39h1, HP1α, and HDACs onto MBD1-containing methylated DNA sites may exemplify the possible presence of a repression pathway from DNA methylation to these histone modifications in heterochromatic regions. We thank M. Shirakawa (Yokohama City University) and H. Saya (Kumamoto University) for much appreciated support."
https://openalex.org/W2133653109,"Knowledge on the functional properties of tumor-derived endothelial cells (TEC) can be relevant for the development of antiangiogenic therapeutic strategies. In the present study, we obtained and characterized endothelial cell lines from human renal carcinomas. TEC did not undergo senescence and showed constant expression of markers of endothelial activation and angiogenesis. In vitro, TEC, in contrast to normal endothelial cells, were resistant to apoptosis, proadhesive for renal carcinoma cells, and able to grow and organize in the absence of serum in persistent capillary-like structures. In vivo, TEC were able to grow in immunodeficient mice and to form vascular structures connected with the circulation. At a molecular level, gene array analysis showed an increased expression of genes involved in survival and cell adhesion compared with expression in normal microvascular endothelial cells. Moreover, expression of angiopoietin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-D and the Akt survival pathway were up-regulated. Inhibition of interaction of VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 with VEGF-D but not of Tie-2-angiopoietin-1 interaction with soluble receptors abrogated Akt activation and survival of TEC. These results indicate that at least some of the TEC within a tumor display abnormal characteristics in terms of survival and angiogenic properties and also indicate the presence of a functional autocrine pathway related to VEGF-D."
https://openalex.org/W2099978129,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major factor mediating endothelial cell survival, migration, and proliferation during angiogenesis, is expressed as five splice variants (121, 145, 165, 189, and 206 aminoacids) encoded by a single gene. Although the three shorter isoforms are mainly diffusible, the two longer ones are sequestered in cell membranes after secretion. However, their potential role as true components of the extracellular matrix has not been investigated. We determined that endothelial cells could adhere and spread on VEGF189 and VEGF165, but not on VEGF121. Adhesion was mediated by the alpha3beta1 and alpha(v)beta3 integrins and other alpha(v) integrins but not by the cognate VEGF receptors. Cells migrated on VEGF165 and VEGF189 and displayed a stellate morphology with numerous lamellopodia and FAK staining but no actin stress fibers. Tumstatin, an antiangiogenic peptide that interacts with the alpha(v)beta3 integrin, could inhibit adhesion on VEGF, and this effect was potentiated by anti-alpha(v)beta3 blocking antibody. Immobilized VEGF almost totally abolished endothelial cell apoptosis through interactions with integrins. The inhibition of alpha(v)beta3 engagement with immobilized VEGF by tumstatin inhibited most of its survival activity. We have thus determined a new VEGF receptor-independent role for immobilized VEGF in supporting cell adhesion and survival through interactions with integrins."

PPARα heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor α (RXRα; NR2B1) and binds to specific DNA sequence elements, designated PPREs, which consist of a direct repeat of the hexanucleotide core motif PuGGTCA separated by 1 or 2 nucleotides (DR1 or DR2). PPARα mediates the hypotriglyceridemic effect of fibrates by regulating the transcription of key genes associated with different intra- and extracellular metabolic pathways. Fibrates increase cellular fatty acid transport and uptake, conversion to acyl-CoA derivatives, and catabolism by β-oxidation, which results in decreased substrate availability for triglyceride synthesis and very low density lipoprotein production by the liver. In addition, activated PPARα promotes lipolysis and clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, thus decreasing the plasma levels of triglycerides (11Barbier O. Torra I.P. Duguay Y. Blanquart C. Fruchart J.C. Glineur C. Staels B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). These extracellular effects have been attributed to an increase in LPL activity via induction of its expression in the liver and reduction of hepatic expression (and subsequently serum levels) of apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII), an established inhibitor of LPL activity and remnant particle catabolism (7Staels B.

The farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR, NR1H4) is another member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that has been described as a key regulator in the control of plasma triglyceride levels (16Edwards P.A.

In addition, recent findings have shown that FXR regulates lipoprotein metabolism (16Edwards P.A. Kast H.R. Anisfeld A.M. J.

Consistent with these observations, FXR-deficient mice exhibited a 150% increase in plasma triglyceride levels (36Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J.

Gonzalez F.J. Willson T.M. Edwards P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) have reported that activated FXR induces the expression of apoCII, an obligate cofactor for LPL, which in turn would result in the hydrolysis of triglycerides in chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein. These data provide a mechanism to explain the hypotriglyceridemic effects of the natural FXR activator chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) when administered to patients with cholesterol-rich gallstones (37Iser J.H. Sali A. Drugs. 1981; 21: 90-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel apolipoprotein, designated apoAV, was suggested to play a significant role on plasma triglyceride metabolism. Pennacchio et al. (38Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M.

At the same time, van der Vliet et al. (39van der Vliet H.N. Sammels M.G. Leegwater A.C. Levels J.H. Reitsma P.H. Boers W. Chamuleau R.A. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the predicted amino acid sequence showed appreciable homology with apoAI and apoAIV. Evidence for the involvement of apoAV in triglyceride metabolism was obtained in mice, in which serum triglyceride concentrations were decreased to one-third when a human apoAV transgene was overexpressed (38Pennacchio L.A.

Conversely, plasma triglyceride levels were 4-fold elevated in knockout mice lacking apoAV compared with their wild-type littermates (38Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the locus of the apoAV gene were found to be significantly associated with plasma triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein mass levels in several ethnic groups (38Pennacchio L.A.

Notwithstanding, the specific biological functions of apoAV in triglyceride metabolism or liver regeneration are still unknown. Pennacchio et al. (38Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) reported a genomic organization of human apoAV with four exons. In contrast, van der Vliet et al. (39van der Vliet H.N. Sammels M.G. Leegwater A.C. Levels J.H. Reitsma P.H. Boers W. Chamuleau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44512-44520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) reported three exons. Both groups showed that the expression of apoAV mRNA was restricted to the liver. The current studies were undertaken to provide a comprehensive analysis of the regulation of human apoAV gene expression. We presently describe the genomic structure, the transcription start site, and the promoter of the human apoAV gene. Inasmuch as PPARα and FXR play key roles in the regulation of genes involved in triglyceride metabolism, we sought to evaluate their potential effects on human apoAV gene expression. We show that a novel FXRE is present in the promoter of human apoAV and demonstrate that human apoAV is a bona fide PPARα target gene. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms whereby PPARα and its ligands lower plasma triglyceride levels. RNA Ligase-mediated Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RLM-RACE)—The start of transcription of human apoAV was identified by using GeneRacer™ (Invitrogen). This kit provides a modification of the RACE method that ensures the capture of only full-length 5′ ends of specific transcripts via elimination of truncated messages from the amplification process. Human liver total RNA (Clontech) was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase and tobacco acid pyrophosphatase according to the instructions of the kit. After the selective ligation of an RNA oligonucleotide to the 5′-ends of decapped mRNA, first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with the ThermoScript™ RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen; not supplied in the GeneRacer™ kit) at 50 °C for 50 min and a reverse human apoAV-specific primer (JCR81; see Table I). The cDNA 5′-end was amplified by using Platinum™ TaqDNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen; not supplied in the GeneRacer™ kit) and primers GeneRacer™ 5′ and JCR80 (Table I). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. The sample was then diluted 20-fold, and 1 μl was used in a second PCR with nested primers (GeneRacer™ 5′ Nested and JCR79). DNA products were cloned into pCR4-TOPO™ vector (Invitrogen) and then sequenced.Table IPrimers used in this studyNameSequence (5′ → 3′)Use in this studyJCR 81hapoAV ex 4 ASGATCCATCGTGTAGGGCTTCAGTTGRLM-RACEJCR 80hapoAV ex 4 ASATGTAGGGCTGGAGGCGAGCCTTCACRLM-RACEJCR 79hapoAV ex 4 ASAGAGGCCTCAGCTTTTCCAGGAACTTGRLM-RACEJCR 65hapoAV -2455 FAGTCGGTACCTCAACTGGGCTTGCCCTATGCTransfectionsJCR 44hapoAV -617 C FAGTCGGTACCTCATGGGGCAAATCTCACTTTCGCTransfectionsJCR 45hapoAV -617 T FAGTCGGTACCTCATGGGGCAAATCTTACTTTCGCTransfectionsJCR107hapoAV -535 FAGTCGGTACCCTGCCTGGCTTCCCTTGCTTGTransfectionsJCR108hapoAV -437 FAGTCGGTACCTGTAGTGAAGCTTTCAGGTransfectionsJCR109hapoAV -242 FAGTCGGTACCTGGGTGAGGAGTTCAGCCCCATCCTransfectionsJCR110hapoAV -82 FAGTCGGTACCACGTGGTATTTACTCAGAGCTransfectionsJCR 95hapoAV +18 RAGTCGCTAGCTCACCTGCTCACGTCTGGTransfectionsJCR 96hapoAV +529 RAGTCGCTAGCCTGCTCTGAGAAGACAGGTransfectionsJCR 117hapoAV -617/-593 FGATCCTCATGGGGCAAATCTCACTTTCGAEMSAJCR 118hapoAV -617/-593 RGATCTCGAAAGTGAGATTTGCCCCATGAGEMSAJCR 141hapoAV -275/-247 FGATCCGGGAAGGTTAAAGGTCATGGGGTTTGGGAEMSAJCR 142hapoAV -275/-247 RGATCTCCCAAACCCCATGACCTTTAACCTTCCCGEMSAJCR 155hapoAV -169/-147 FGATCCAGGGCACTCATTAACCCTCTGAEMSAJCR 156hapoAV -169/-147 RGATCTCAGAGGGTTAATGAGTGCCCTGEMSAJCR 153hapoAV -144/-117 FGATCCTGCCAGGGAAAGGGCAGGAGGTGAGTGCAEMSAJCR 154hapoAV -144/-117 RGATCTGCACTCACCTCCTGCCCTTTCCCTGGCAGEMSAJCR 151hapoAV -52/-31 FGATCCAGAGGCTCAGGGCCCTGGAGAEMSAJCR 152hapoAV -52/-31 RGATCTCTCCAGGGCCCTGAGCCTCTGEMSAJCR 157mitHMGS -113/-82 FGATCCTTGTTCTGAGACCTTTGGCCCAGTTTTTCTGAEMSAJCR 158mitHMGS -113/-82 RGATCTCAGAAAAACTGGGCCAAAGGTCTCAGAACAAGEMSAJCR 145hapoAV -484/-462 FGATCCGTGGTTGGTCTTTAACCCTATGAEMSAJCR 146hapoAV -484/-462 RGATCTCATAGGGTTAAAGACCAACCACGEMSAJCR 123hapoAV -399/-374 FGATCCTGGTAGGTGAACACTGTCCATCTTGAEMSAJCR 124hapoAV -399/-374 RGATCTCAAGATGGACAGTGTTCACCTACCAGEMSAJCR 143hapoAV -298/-263 FGATCCGGTGGGCCAGCCAGCAGGTCAGTGGGAAGGTTAAAGAEMSAJCR 144hapoAV -298/-263 RGATCTCTTTAACCTTCCCACTGACCTGCTGGCTGGCCCACCGEMSAJCR 165hapoAV mt DR1 FGATCCGGGAAGGTTAAAcaaCATGGGGTTTGGGAEMSAJCR 166hapoAV mt DR1 RGATCTCCCAAACCCCATGttgTTTAACCTTCCCGEMSAJCR 147hI-BABP FXRE FGATCCCAGGGTGAATAACCTCGGGGAEMSAJCR 148hI-BABP FXRE RGATCTCCCCGAGGTTATTCACCCTGGEMSAJCR 169hapoAV dirmut DR1 FGCAGGTCAGTGGGAAGGTTAAAcaaCATGGGGTTTGGGAGSite-directed mutagenesisJCR 170hapoAV dirmut DR1 RCTCCCAAACCCCATGttgTTTAACCTTCCCACTGACCTGCSite-directed mutagenesisJCR 167hapoAV dirmut IR8 FGCTGGGAGGCAGCTGAGaaCAACTTCTTTcGttCTTCCACGTGGSite-directed mutagenesisJCR 168hapoAV dirmut IR8 RCCACGTGGAAGaaCgAAAGAAGTTGttCTCAGCTGCCTCCCAGCSite-directed mutagenesisJCR 139hapoAV -109/-80 FGATCCAGCTGAGGTCAACTTCTTTTGAACTTCCATransfections and EMSAJCR 140hapoAV -109/-80 RGATCTGGAAGTTCAAAAGAAGTTGACCTCAGCTGTransfections and EMSAJCR 159hapoAV mt1 IR8 FGATCCAGCTGAGaaCAACTTCTTTTGAACTTCCATransfections and EMSAJCR 160hapoAV mt1 IR8 RGATCTGGAAGTTCAAAAGAAGTTGttCTCAGCTGTransfections and EMSAJCR 161hapoAV mt2 IR8 FGATCCAGCTGAGGTCAACTTCTTTcGttCTTCCATransfections and EMSAJCR 162hapoAV mt2 IR8 RGATCTGGAAGaaCgAAAGAAGTTGACCTCAGCTGTransfections and EMSAJCR 163hapoAV mt3 IR8 FGATCCAGCTGAGaaCAACTTCTTTcGttCTTCCATransfections and EMSAJCR 164hapoAV mt3 IR8 RGATCTGGAAGaaCgAAAGAAGTTGttCTCAGCTGTransfections and EMSAJCR3618 S SGGGAGCCTGAGAAACGGCReal time RT-PCRJCR3718 S ASGGGTCGGGAGTGGGTAATTTReal time RT-PCRXP3hapoAV SAGCTGGTGGGCTGGAATTTReal time RT-PCRXP4hapoAV ASGGCCACCTGCTCCATCAGReal time RT-PCRBA1hBSEP SGGTGAGAAAAGAGAGGTTGAAAGGReal time RT-PCRBA2hBSEP ASCCACACGAATCCAGTAAAGAATCCReal time RT-PCRBA3hSHP SCGCCCTATCATTGGAGATGTReal time RT-PCRBA4hSHP ASAGGAGCATTGGGTCACCTCReal time RT-PCR Open table in a new tab Plasmids—Several constructs containing the 5′-flanking region of human apoAV (–2455/+18, –617/+18, –617/+529, –535/+18, –437/+18, –242/+18, and –82/+18, relative to the transcription start site reported in this paper) were obtained by PCR from human bacterial artificial chromosome-RPCI-11–442E11 DNA (BACPAC Resources, Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute) with Platinum™ TaqDNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen). Forward primers were tailed with a KpnI restriction site. Reverse primers were tailed with an NheI site. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and NheI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the promoterless firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega), generating p–2455/+18hAvLUC, p–617/+18hAvLUC, p–617/+529hAvLUC, p–535/+18hAvLUC, p–437/+18hAvLUC, p–242/+18hAvLUC, and p–82/+18hAvLUC.

Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen endotoxin-free maxipreparation method and quantitated spectrophotometrically. The integrities of all plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Transfection and Reporter Assays—Human hepatoblastoma Hep3B and monkey kidney CV-1 cell lines were cultured in Eagle's basal medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (medium A) and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS).

https://openalex.org/W2039374993,"Metal transporters regulated by iron can transport a variety of divalent metals, suggesting that iron regulation is important for specificity of iron transport. In plants, the iron-regulated broad-range metal transporter IRT1 is required for uptake of iron into the root epidermis. Functions of other iron-regulated plant metal transporters are not yet established. To deduce novel plant iron transport functions we studied the regulation of four tomato metal transporter genes belonging to the nramp and irt families with respect to environmental and genetic factors influencing iron uptake. We isolated Lenramp1 and Lenramp3 from tomato and demonstrate that these genes encode functional NRAMP metal transporters in yeast, where they were iron-regulated and localized mainly to intracellular vesicles. Lenramp1 and Leirt1 revealed both root-specific expression and up-regulation by iron deficiency, respectively, in contrast to Leirt2 and Lenramp3. Lenramp1 and Leirt1, but not Lenramp3 and Leirt2, were down-regulated in the roots of fer mutant plants deficient in a bHLH gene regulating iron uptake. In chloronerva mutant plants lacking the functional enzyme for synthesis of the plant-specific metal chelator nicotianamine Leirt1 and Lenramp1 were up-regulated despite sufficient iron supply independent of a functional fer gene. Lenramp1 was expressed in the vascular root parenchyma in a similar cellular pattern as the fer gene. However, the fer gene was not sufficient for inducing Lenramp1 and Leirt1 when ectopically expressed. Based on our results, we suggest a novel function for NRAMP1 in mobilizing iron in the vascular parenchyma upon iron deficiency in plants. We discuss fer/nicotianamine synthase-dependent and -independent regulatory pathways for metal transporter gene regulation. Metal transporters regulated by iron can transport a variety of divalent metals, suggesting that iron regulation is important for specificity of iron transport. In plants, the iron-regulated broad-range metal transporter IRT1 is required for uptake of iron into the root epidermis. Functions of other iron-regulated plant metal transporters are not yet established. To deduce novel plant iron transport functions we studied the regulation of four tomato metal transporter genes belonging to the nramp and irt families with respect to environmental and genetic factors influencing iron uptake. We isolated Lenramp1 and Lenramp3 from tomato and demonstrate that these genes encode functional NRAMP metal transporters in yeast, where they were iron-regulated and localized mainly to intracellular vesicles.

Based on our results, we suggest a novel function for NRAMP1 in mobilizing iron in the vascular parenchyma upon iron deficiency in plants. We discuss fer/nicotianamine synthase-dependent and -independent regulatory pathways for metal transporter gene regulation. The transition metal iron is essential for many cellular electron transfer reactions. Because of its redox potential free iron may become toxic and produce radicals. In addition, uptake of various divalent metals can interfere with that of iron and vice versa, as iron transport mechanisms often do not discriminate metals. These characteristics may explain the presence of multiple transport and regulatory mechanisms for storage and mobilization of iron in all cells and organisms. Molecular characterization of iron mobilization in plants exposed to iron deficiency has been a recent subject of investigation. In dicotyledon plants, iron is mobilized by reduction and taken up across the plasmalemma into the root epidermis via IRT1 1The abbreviations used are: IRT, iron-regulated transporter; NRAMP, natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1; ZIP, zinc- and iron-regulated transporter; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; BPDS, bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid disodium salt; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DIC, differential interference contrast; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome.

Dedaldechamp F. Gaymard F. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.F. Curie C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1223-1233Google Scholar). IRT1 is a member of the ZIP family of broad range metal transport proteins identified from eukaryotes and, recently, also bacteria (4Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Google Scholar, 5Grass G. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Smith R.L. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 864-866Google Scholar, 6Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 244-249Google Scholar). Atirt1 transcription is predominant in roots and induced upon iron deficiency (2Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Google Scholar). Loss of function of irt1 leads to reduced viability in Arabidopsis unless excess iron is supplied, suggesting that IRT1 is a major structural component of iron uptake in plants (3Vert G. Grotz N. Dedaldechamp F. Gaymard F. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.F. Curie C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1223-1233Google Scholar, 7Varotto C. Maiwald D. Pesaresi P. Jahns P. Salamini F. Leister D. Plant J. 2002; 31: 589-599Google Scholar). Grasses may take up iron differently because they mobilize iron by secreting potent phytosiderophores from the root and subsequently take up the iron-siderophore complexes (1Römheld V. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 70: 231-234Google Scholar). Internal transport and mobilization of iron inside the plant root is still unclear. Iron is transported via the xylem to the shoot essentially as iron citrate (for an example, see Ref. 8Lopez-Millan A.F. Morales F. Abadia A. Abadia J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 873-884Google Scholar). Furthermore, iron can be translocated in the phloem, for example as complex with nicotianamine, a diffusible plant-specific small non-proteinogenic tripeptide derived from methionine (for review, see Ref. 9Stephan U.W. Scholz G. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 88: 522-529Google Scholar), or iron-binding proteins (10Kruger C. Berkowitz O. Stephan U.W. Hell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25062-25069Google Scholar). Because plants play a major role for human nutrition and because iron deficiency is a worldwide nutritional problem, one challenge is to produce iron-rich crops (for examples, see Refs. 11Goto F. Yoshihara T. Shigemoto N. Toki S. Takaiwa F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 282-286Google Scholar and 12Takahashi M. Nakanishi H. Kawasaki S. Nishizawa N.K. Mori S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 466-469Google Scholar). In this context, it is of great interest to study internal iron mobilization and transport in plants. The specific roles of iron transporters other than IRT1 are not known yet. Atirt2, although in sequence and expression pattern similar to Atirt1, is not capable of functionally complementing irt1 mutants, and loss of function causes no obvious phenotype upon low iron supply (7Varotto C. Maiwald D. Pesaresi P. Jahns P. Salamini F. Leister D. Plant J. 2002; 31: 589-599Google Scholar, 13Vert G. Briat J.F. Curie C. Plant J. 2001; 26: 181-189Google Scholar). To date six members of the Arabidopsis nramp gene family have been assigned and partially characterized. NRAMP proteins are broad range membrane-bound metal transporters found in all eukaryotes (for review, see Ref. 14Forbes J.R. Gros P. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 397-403Google Scholar). Their name was derived from phagosomal NRAMP1 (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1), which functions as an efflux pump in the membrane and in this way enhances resistance against intracellular bacteria by reducing metal availability (for review, see Ref. 15Nelson N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4361-4371Google Scholar). Mammalian NRAMP2 is an important factor for iron transport from the duodenum lumen into epithelial cells (16Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick L.M. Garrick M.D. Andrews N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Google Scholar, 17Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C. Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Google Scholar). The three yeast NRAMP proteins, SMF1, SMF2, and SMF3, are differentially regulated by iron and manganese and may serve to release these metals from intracellular stores (18Portnoy M.E. Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Google Scholar, 19Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 885-891Google Scholar). It was found that Atnramp1, Atnramp3, and Atnnramp4 encode functional plant metal transporters and are expressed at higher levels upon low iron supply in plants (20Curie C. Alonso J.M. Le Jean M. Ecker J.R. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 749-755Google Scholar, 21Thomine S. Wang R.C. Ward J.M. Crawford N.M. Schroeder J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4991-4996Google Scholar). Specificity of plant transporters may be achieved essentially by differential regulation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels as shown for IRT1 and metal transporters in other eukaryotes (2Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Google Scholar, 22Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Google Scholar, 23Portnoy M.E. Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 119-124Google Scholar, 24Connolly E.L. Fett J.P. Guerinot M.L. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1347-1357Google Scholar). In plants, iron acquisition is controlled by yet unknown iron signals. A promising clue about signaling components involved in iron acquisition was recently derived from the molecular identification of the tomato fer gene encoding a root-specific bHLH protein (25Ling H.Q. Bauer P. Bereczky Z. Keller B. Ganal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13938-13943Google Scholar). The tomato fer mutant is unable to develop physiological and morphological iron-deficiency responses such as iron reduction and induced Leirt1 transporter gene expression in roots and accumulates less iron than wild type, leading to severe chlorosis (25Ling H.Q. Bauer P. Bereczky Z. Keller B. Ganal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13938-13943Google Scholar, 26Brown J.C. Ambler J.E. Physiol. Plant. 1974; 31: 221-224Google Scholar, 27Brown J.C. Chaney R.L. Ambler J.E. Physiol. Plant. 1971; 25: 48-53Google Scholar). The fer gene seems to be required for sensing iron availability in the root tip and subsequently regulating the appropriate physiological and morphological responses (25Ling H.Q. Bauer P. Bereczky Z. Keller B. Ganal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13938-13943Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanism and concrete molecular responses affected by the fer mutation are not known. An opposite effect on strategy I responses is observed in the chloronerva mutant from tomato, which lacks nicotianamine due to a mutation in nicotianamine synthase (28Ling H.Q. Koch G. Baumlein H. Ganal M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7098-7103Google Scholar). chloronerva mutant plants display increased iron reductase activity at sufficient iron supply and over-accumulate metals compared with the wild type, suggesting that nicotianamine synthase is required for adequate uptake and distribution of iron in plants (for review, see Ref. 9Stephan U.W. Scholz G. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 88: 522-529Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed the possible role and regulation of two nramp genes and two irt genes from tomato in response to environmental and genetic factors related to iron nutrition. We could establish a model of gene interactions and regulation involved in iron uptake in plants. From our results we propose a novel role for nramp1 in plants. Plant Growth—10-Day-old tomato seedlings were transferred into moderately aerated hydroponic culture with Hoagland solution containing 10 μm FeNaEDTA (normal iron supply) (according to Stephan and Prochazka (29Stephan U.W. Prochazka Z. Acta Bot. Neerl. 1989; 38: 147-153Google Scholar)). After 2 days, the experiment was started by transferring the seedlings into Hoagland solution with varying concentrations of iron for up to 8 days. The limiting supply was 0.1 μm FeNaEDTA; excess supply was 100 μm FeNaEDTA. Plant Material—Seeds were derived from the lines Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Moneymaker (wild type), T3238fer (mutant fer), and chloronerva (mutant chloronerva). Homozygous fer or chloronerva mutant seeds were obtained after grafting mutant shoots onto wild type root stocks, which rescued the phenotypes. Double homozygous mutants for fer and chloronerva (fer/fer; chln/chln) were obtained in the following way. Among the 1:8 segregating progeny of a double heterozygous plant (fer/+; chln/+), chlorotic F2 individuals were selected and grafted onto wild type root stocks to obtain seeds (F2 genotypes fer/fer; chln/chln, fer/+; chln/chln, +/+; chln/chln, fer/fer; +/+ and fer/fer; chln/+). We identified F3 lines that segregated 1:3 for double mutants (yellow very small leaves, yellow veins, green-yellow cotyledons = fer/fer; chln/chln) in a chloronerva background (yellow leaves, green veins, green cotyledons = fer/+; chln/chln or +/+; chln/chln) or fer background (yellow leaves, yellow veins, green cotyledons = fer/fer; chln/+ or fer/fer; +/+). Non-segregating double mutant lines were also identified. Individual mutants derived from a segregating line in the chloronerva background were rescued by grafting. Genomic DNA was prepared from individuals and checked for the presence of the mutant fer allele by restriction fragment length polymorphism according to Ling et al. (25Ling H.Q. Bauer P. Bereczky Z. Keller B. Ganal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13938-13943Google Scholar). This way it was confirmed that double mutants with severe shoot phenotype were homozygous for the mutant fer allele, whereas mutants with chloronerva phenotype were either heterozygous for the mutant fer allele or contained the wild type allele only. Transgenic tomato plants expressing a fer cDNA behind the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in a fer mutant background have been described by (25Ling H.Q. Bauer P. Bereczky Z. Keller B. Ganal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13938-13943Google Scholar). Gene Isolation and Characterization—Lenramp1c DNA was obtained as follows. Degenerate primers 5′-aytcyccagcataagtdcc-3′ and 5′-aatstmttcytscaytcdgc-3′, corresponding to conserved motifs of Atnramp1 and Osnramp1 genes (20Curie C. Alonso J.M. Le Jean M. Ecker J.R. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 749-755Google Scholar, 30Belouchi A. Kwan T. Gros P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1085-1092Google Scholar), were used to amplify DNA fragments from cDNA prepared from iron-starved tomato root RNA. Amplification was performed for 35 cycles using ExTaq polymerase (Taqara) in the presence of 2 μm primers, 92 °C denaturing for 1 min, 45 °C annealing for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. A main amplification product of 334 bp was obtained that was subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The labeled purified 334-bp fragment was used to screen a tomato BAC library (LE_Hba, L. esculentum cv. Heinz 1706, Clemson University). Lenramp1 contained on BAC clone 24I11 was sequenced to obtain full exon and intron sequences. Specific primers were designed (5′-atggagaatcaacagcaaaatcaa-3′ and 5′-ttattgtggcaatggaatatcagc-3′) to amplify full-length Lenramp1-coding sequence from root cDNA. The Lenramp1 cDNA fragment was subcloned into pCRII and fully sequenced (accession number AY196091). A Lenramp3 cDNA clone was identified by a BLAST search of Arabidopsis and rice NRAMP amino acid sequences (20Curie C. Alonso J.M. Le Jean M. Ecker J.R. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 749-755Google Scholar, 21Thomine S. Wang R.C. Ward J.M. Crawford N.M. Schroeder J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4991-4996Google Scholar, 30Belouchi A. Kwan T. Gros P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1085-1092Google Scholar) against the tomato EST data base (tigrblast.tigr.org/tgi). Several EST clones corresponding to four assembled transcription units were obtained from Clemson University and sequenced. EST clone cLET21E13 fully contained the Lenramp3-coding sequence (accession number AY196092). Yeast Complementation Assay—Lenramp1-and Lenramp3-coding sequences subcloned as PCR fragments into pCRII (Invitrogen) were excised using EcoRI and cloned in correct orientation into the EcoRI site from pYES2 (Invitrogen) behind the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter, yielding pYES2-LeNR1 and pYES2-LeNR3, respectively. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain smf1 (smf1Δ, SLY8, (31Korshunova Y.O. Eide D. Clark W.G. Guerinot M.L. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 37-44Google Scholar) was verified for its genotype (MATα his3 ade2 leu2 trp1 ura3 smf1::HIS3) by plating onto selective media and transformed according to Dohmen et al. (32Dohmen R.J. Strasser A.W. Honer C.B. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1991; 7: 691-692Google Scholar) with pYES2-LeNR1, pYES2-LeNR3, and as a control, with empty pYES2. Transformed cells were selected on SD medium containing amino acid supplements without uracil (SD–ura) and containing 2% glucose. Liquid overnight cultures of transformed cells and, as further control, wild type Y190 (Clontech) were each diluted to optical densities of 0.5, 0.05, and 0.005 and spotted onto SD–ura plates supplemented with 2% galactose and containing 5, 10, 20, and 50 mm EGTA, respectively, in the presence of 50 mm MES at pH 6.0 for complementation assays. Photos of yeast colonies were taken after 2 days of growth at 30 °C. GFP Fusion Protein Localization in Yeast—Full-length coding sequences for Lenramp1 and Lenramp3 were amplified using primers that contained the Gateway-compatible attachment sites. Following the Gateway protocol (Invitrogen), these PCR fragments were cloned into destination vector pDESTFY (provided by E. Walker, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA), a Gateway-compatible derivative of pFL61 (33Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422Google Scholar), allowing the expression of a protein in-frame with a C-terminal GFP behind the strong PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase) promoter. The resulting plasmids were named pEXFY-NR1 and pEXFY-NR3 and transformed into yeast strain L40coat according to Dohmen et al. (32Dohmen R.J. Strasser A.W. Honer C.B. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1991; 7: 691-692Google Scholar). Positive colonies selected on SD–ura medium were each inoculated into SD–ura medium (normal) or SD–ura medium containing either 50 μm BPDS, 20 mm EGTA, or both. After 2 days of growth cells were observed using a Axiophot microscope (Zeiss) integrated into a digital optical three-dimensional microscope system (Digital Optics Inc.). Only cells devoid of strong autofluorescence as visible in red (filter set XF 102–2; Omega Optical Inc.) have been considered for analysis. Image stacks were taken in differential interference contrast (DIC) and GFP fluorescence (filter set XF 100–2) to generate extended focus images and to combine them for three-dimensional-three-dimensional co-localization. To identify nuclei, cells were embedded in 0.2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and observed using the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride filter set F31–013 (AHF Analysentechnik AG). Gene Expression Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from plant material using TRIZOL (Invitrogen). 2–5 μg of the RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the RevertAid™ first strand cDNA synthesis kit (MBI Fermentas) using dT 18-mer oligonucleotides. PCR was performed on the cDNA samples using standard conditions. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis was achieved according to Bauer et al. (34Bauer P. Crespi M.D. Szecsi J. Allison L.A. Schultze M. Ratet P. Kondorosi E. Kondorosi A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 585-592Google Scholar). For each gene the optimal amount of cycles was determined so that expression could be analyzed in the exponential phase. Primers utilized surrounded an intron if present to distinguish between cDNA and genomic amplification products. Oligonucleotide primers and cycle numbers used were 5′-gctttgtcctgaggctaataatg-3′ and 5′-gtttcgcgttgtttgtgtcc-3′ for Lenramp1 (25 cycles), 5′-tgttggcggatagattactcgagg-3′ and 5′-ggtaattccccgtgaaatgaggtatac-3′ for Lenramp3 (25 cycles), 5′-gcactttgctttcatcaaatgtttg-3′ and 5′-ttgcaactcccaataggtcatgaag-3′ for Leirt1 (25 cycles) (35Eckhardt U. Marques A.M. Buckhout T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 437-448Google Scholar), 5′-gcactttgctttcatcaaatgtttg-3′ and 5′-tacatagcagttcaaatttaaccacg-3′ for Leirt2 (25 cycles) (35Eckhardt U. Marques A.M. Buckhout T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 437-448Google Scholar), 5′-tttcggagcgcaaaaggagag-3′ and 5′-cttgattgctggataataggttgtgaa-3′ for fer (25 cycles) (25Ling H.Q. Bauer P. Bereczky Z. Keller B. Ganal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13938-13943Google Scholar), and 5′-gcggccgatccagacat-3′ and 5′-cccggatccgaaacataacacaagacataaatc-3′ for chloronerva (25 cycles) (28Ling H.Q. Koch G. Baumlein H. Ganal M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7098-7103Google Scholar). For constitutive control amplification we used 5′-cctcttgggctcgttaatctggct-3′ and 5′-ctggtggttttgaagctggtatct-3′ primers to amplify elongation factor gene Leef-1a (20 cycles) (36Pokalsky A.R. Hiatt W.R. Ridge N. Rasmussen R. Houck C.M. Shewmaker C.K. Nucleic Acid Res. 1989; 17: 4661-4673Google Scholar). Amplification products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization according to standard procedures. In Situ Hybridization—Roots tips from plants grown for 8 days in Hoagland medium with 0.1 μm FeNaEDTA were fixed and embedded in paraplast according to Kyozuka et al. (37Kyozuka J. Konishi S. Nemoto K. Izawa T. Shimamoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1979-1982Google Scholar). 10-μm transverse root sections were hybridized using digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes according to Jackson (38Jackson D. Bowles D.J. Gurr S.J. McPherson M. A Practical Approach in Molecular Plant Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 163-174Google Scholar). RNA probes were prepared from 500–600 bp of amplified cDNA fragments subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) using either T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase for in vitro transcription. Hybridization signals were detected using primary anti-Dig antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase (violet staining, according to Jackson (38Jackson D. Bowles D.J. Gurr S.J. McPherson M. A Practical Approach in Molecular Plant Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 163-174Google Scholar). Probe cDNA fragments were obtained using the following primer pairs: 5′-ggccaatttatcatgcaaggatttc-3′ and 5′-ttgtggcaatggaatatcagcaagat-3′ for Lenramp1; 5′-atggagagtggtaatgcatcaatgga-3′ and tgattgctggataataggttgtgaaat-3′ for fer (25Ling H.Q. Bauer P. Bereczky Z. Keller B. Ganal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13938-13943Google Scholar); 5′-tcaagcacatcgccatcatctttattctca-3′ and 5′-acccatttcttgatcagcaccaccagttt-3′ (Leirt2a fragment) and 5′-ggagttgaaggcactaaattactacg-3′ and 5′-gagggaaatacatagcagttcaaat-3′ (Leirt2b fragment) for Leirt2 (35Eckhardt U. Marques A.M. Buckhout T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 437-448Google Scholar). Leirt2a and Leirt2b probe fragments covered Leirt2 cDNA and were mixed to yield the Leirt2 probe. The Leirt2 probe was specific for Leirt2. Probe fragments covering Leirt1 did not result in any hybridization signals, indicating that there was no cross-hybridization of Leirt1 and Leirt2 RNA probes with the respective mRNAs (not shown). In control reactions labeled sense probes were used that resulted in no signals (Fig. 5, G–I). Identification of nramp Metal Transporter Genes from Tomato— NRAMP proteins are encoded by evolutionarily conserved genes. By performing a BLAST search of plant NRAMP peptide sequences against the tomato EST data base we could identify several EST sequences potentially encoding NRAMP transporters. Several EST clones covering four non-overlapping nramp sequences with similarity to Atnramp3 have been fully sequenced. This way we could determine that these EST nramp sequences were derived from different regions of the same gene. Because of its similarity with Atnramp3 (21Thomine S. Wang R.C. Ward J.M. Crawford N.M. Schroeder J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4991-4996Google Scholar) we have termed this gene Lenramp3 (accession number AY196092). The Lenramp3 coding sequence was fully contained in EST clone cLET21E13. In addition degenerate primers were designed recognizing two conserved regions between Atnramp1 and Osnramp1, one of them representing the conserved transport motif (20Curie C. Alonso J.M. Le Jean M. Ecker J.R. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 749-755Google Scholar, 39Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P. Cell. 1993; 73: 469-485Google Scholar). Using the degenerate primers, a 334-bp nramp cDNA fragment was amplified from iron-starved root cDNA. Sequencing revealed best sequence similarity with Atnramp1 so that this gene was termed Lenramp1. Full-length Lenramp1 sequence was obtained from a tomato BAC clone containing the 334-bp DNA fragment, namely 24I11. Full-length Lenramp1 cDNA was amplified from root cDNA, subcloned, and sequenced (accession number AY196091). Lenramp1 cDNA sequence was identical to the exon genomic sequence obtained from the BAC clone. The deduced protein sequences of LeNRAMP1 and LeNRAMP3 were compared with those of the six Arabidopsis and three rice NRAMP protein sequences (20Curie C. Alonso J.M. Le Jean M. Ecker J.R. Briat J.F.

Gros P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1085-1092Google Scholar). Sequence comparison showed that plant NRAMP sequences can be divided into two subgroups and that LeNRAMP1 and LeNRAMP3 fall into distinct subgroups (Fig. 1). Comparing Arabidopsis and tomato NRAMP sequences showed that LeNRAMP1 is most similar with AtNRAMP1 and AtNRAMP6. LeNRAMP3 shows the highest sequence similarity with AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4. This finding indicates that distinct NRAMP functions might be conserved in plants. Functional Analysis of Lenramp1 and Lenramp3 in Yeast—To determine whether Lenramp1 and Lenramp3 might encode functional metal NRAMP transporters, full-length coding sequences have been cloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2 behind the galactose-inducible GAL1 yeast promoter. These constructs were expressed in the yeast smf1 mutant, deficient in a broad range metal transporter nramp homolog (40Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Google Scholar, 41Chen X.Z. Peng J.B. Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35089-35094Google Scholar). To test for functional complementation, smf1 mutants transformed with pYES2 containing either Lenramp1, Lenramp3, or empty control vector and, as positive control, wild type yeast were spotted in different dilutions on minimal medium in the presence of 5, 10, 20, and 50 mm divalent metal chelator EGTA. Under these conditions, Lenramp1- and Lenramp3-transformed smf1 strains grew significantly better than control mutant smf1 strain transformed with empty vector (Fig. 2A). Growth of LeNR1- and LeNR3-transformed yeast cells was comparable with that of wild type if the medium was supplemented with up to 20 mm EGTA (Fig. 2A). At 50 mm EGTA, growth of LeNR1- and LeNR3-transformed cells was retarded compared with that of wild type but significantly better than that of control pYES2-smf1 mutant cells (Fig. 2A). Growth of wild type was also reduced at 50 mm EGTA compared with lower EGTA concentrations (Fig. 2A). Therefore, Lenramp1 and Lenramp3 both encode functional metal transporters able to restore growth of a yeast metal uptake mutant. To determine in which compartments LeNRAMP1 and LeNRAMP3 could be mediating metal transport, we localized the proteins in yeast cells using GFP fusion constructs. We observed different types of staining patterns when GFP was fused to a NRAMP protein (Fig. 2, C–H), whereas fluorescence was fairly uniform when GFP was expressed in its free form without fusion protein (Fig. 2B). Generally, only few cells expressed LeNRAMP-GFP fusion proteins. However, their number increased up to 40-fold when 50 μm BPDS or 50 μm BPDS and 20 mm EGTA was added to the growth medium (data not shown). The number of stained cells increased up to 5-fold in the presence of only 20 mm EGTA (data not shown). BPDS is a synthetic chelator for iron-causing iron deficiency. EGTA chelates manganese, causing manganese deficiency. LeNRAMP1 was found mainly in single or multiple vesicles upon normal growth conditions (70–80% of GFP-expressing cells) (examples for these staining patterns are given in Fig. 2, C–E). In the presence of BPDS, LeNRAMP1 was found to an even greater extent in single and multiple vesicles (80–90% of GFP exp"

LC3-I, the cytosolic form, is modified to LC3-II, the membrane-bound form, by a mechanism similar to ubiquitylation by E1- and E2-like enzymes, Apg7p and Apg3p, respectively. In the present study, we found that LC3-I is processed to LC3-II during the differentiation and recovery from puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis of podocytes. LC3 is especially expressed in the podocytes of rat kidney as the membrane-bound form LC3-II. Biochemical analysis using a conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte clone (MPC) revealed that LC3-I is processed to LC3-II during the differentiation of cells into mature podocytes and accumulates in the membrane-rich fraction of the cell lysate. LC3-II-localized vesicles, which differ from lysosomes and endosomes, in differentiated MPC cells are morphologically similar to autophagic vacuoles during starvation-induced autophagy. During starvation-induced autophagy, autophagosomes fuses with lysosome and LC3-II on autophagosomes is finally degraded by lysosomal proteases. However, in differentiated MPC cells, little LC3-II on the vesicles is degraded by lysosomal proteases, suggesting that little LC3-II-localized vesicles in differentiated MPC cells fuse with lysosome. Furthermore, the LC3-II level in differentiated MPC cells increases with recovery from damage caused by experimental puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis. These results suggest that LC3-II-localized vesicles play an important role in the physiological function of podocytes."

Tobacco smoke contains numerous carcinogens, and we find that smoke, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, is capable of stimulating cell proliferation. The smoke-triggered mechanism includes the generation of oxygen radicals, which in turn stimulate tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 17) to cleave transmembrane amphiregulin, a ligand for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The binding of amphiregulin to EGFR then stimulates proliferation of lung epithelial cells. These results shed light on the pathogenesis of lung cancer, suggest novel drug targets for the reduction of cancer risk in smokers, and provide insight into how EGFR integrates responses to diverse noxious stimuli. Cells dividing at the time of carcinogen exposure are at particular risk for neoplasia. Tobacco smoke contains numerous carcinogens, and we find that smoke, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, is capable of stimulating cell proliferation.

The binding of amphiregulin to EGFR then stimulates proliferation of lung epithelial cells. These results shed light on the pathogenesis of lung cancer, suggest novel drug targets for the reduction of cancer risk in smokers, and provide insight into how EGFR integrates responses to diverse noxious stimuli. Eighty-seven percent of lung malignancies, the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women, are caused by smoking (American Lung Association Website, 2002). Although this has been known for some time, the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer remains obscure. Perhaps the most significant advances have been in the identification of smoke carcinogens. Benzo[a]pyrene is converted in the lung to benzopyrenediol epoxide, which forms adducts on guanine residues, most notably those in the tumor suppressor gene p53 (1Denissenko M. Pao A. Tang M.-S. Pfeifer G. Science. 1996; 274: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Because of its role in the mitotic arrest of cells with damaged DNA, key mutations in p53 provoke the accumulation of other mutations eventually leading to lung cancer. However, conversion of adducts to mutations can only occur in proliferating cells (2Ames B. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 970-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 3Cohen S. Ellwein L. Science. 1990; 249: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) suggesting that tobacco smoke must also promote cell division before carcinogens such as benzopyrenediol epoxide can effectively mutate DNA. Indeed, hyperproliferation occurs in response to smoke exposure (4Sekhon H. Wright J. Churg A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L557-L563PubMed Google Scholar, 5Barsky S. Roth M. Kleerup E. Simmons M. Tashkin D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and very likely increases cancer risk in the presence of tobacco carcinogens. The mechanism by which tobacco smoke stimulates lung cell proliferation is unknown. Based on the involvement of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; LTA, lipoteichoic acid; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SFM, serum-free medium; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; HBEGF, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor; H2DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. in response to noxious stimuli (6Rosette C.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar), we tested and confirmed the involvement of EGFR in the response of the host cell to tobacco smoke (8Gensch, E., Gebremichael, A., Li, D., Drori, E., Gallup, M., Pinkerton, K., and Basbaum, C. (1999) in Proceedings of the Annual Investigator Meeting of the State of California Tobacco-Related Diseases Research Program, San Francisco, CAGoogle Scholar). In the experiments reported here, we identify mechanisms triggered by smoke that result in both phosphorylation (activation) of EGFR and cell proliferation. Reagents—All tissue culture media and antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen or the University of California, San Francisco, cell culture facility. Chemical inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem except N-acetyl-l-cysteine and N,N′-dimethylthiourea and diphenyliodonium chloride, which were purchased from Sigma. Blocking EGFR antibody AB-1 was purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies to EGFR ligands were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme was from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). All other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). LipofectAMINE was purchased from Invitrogen. Purified lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Staphylococcus aureus and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Mice—Six specific pathogen-free C57 black mice (8 weeks old, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were treated intranasally with the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 or saline solution prior to exposure to smoke in a specially designed chamber (9Gebremichael A. Tullis K. Denison M. Cheek J. Pinkerton K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 76-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Assay for Cell Density—Primary human airway epithelial cells were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and were cultured under conditions recommended by the vendor. NCIH292 (mucoepidermoid carcinoma) cells were also used. NCIH292 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. For cell proliferation assays, cell density was assayed 24 or 48 h after a 4-h treatment with serum-free medium (SFM), smoke-containing medium, or EGF using Cell Titer 96® Aqueous One reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The samples were pre-cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and total protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For detection of ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) proteins, we used lysates from cells that had or had not been transfected with morpholino antisense oligonucleotides. Lysis buffer contained 10 mm 1,10-ortho-phenanthroline to prevent autolysis of the ADAMs. For detection of EGFR ligands shed into cell culture medium, we concentrated the medium 10× using Amicon Centriplus filters with a cutoff of 3 kDa. For determination of the phosphorylation state of EGFR, we incubated equal amounts of lysate with anti-EGFR antibody and Protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The lysate-antibody-bead complex was spun down and washed three times with lysis buffer. Following the final wash, 40 μl of SDS gel-loading buffer was added, the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 3 min, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunoblot analysis of the samples listed above, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween) and supplemented with 5% BSA, then washed with PBS/Tween and incubated with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C. After removing primary antibody with several washes of PBS/Tween, the blot was placed in the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min. After several washes, the antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Smoke Exposures—Smoke particulates were generated in specially designed animal exposure chambers operated by Dr. Kent Pinkerton at the University of California, Davis (9Gebremichael A. Tullis K. Denison M. Cheek J. Pinkerton K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 76-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pall Gelman Pallflex® borosilicate filters (Fisher) were inserted in line during the operation of the chambers. The total suspended smoke particles deposited on each filter were calculated by weighing filters before and after smoke exposure. Filters were mailed to our laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco, where they were stored at 4 °C until use. Prior to each experiment, we incubated filters in a volume of SFM to provide a final concentration of 1.0 mg of smoke particulate per ml of SFM. The filters were rotated in this medium at 4 °C for 3 days prior to use. Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production—NCIH292 cells were incubated for 30 min prior to smoke or SFM exposure with 10 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescent images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics and a Zeiss Axiocam digital camera. Immunofluorescence—NCIH292 cells grown on coverslips were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with or without smoke-containing medium or EGF (100 ng/ml). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with anti-EGFR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) prior to viewing with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope using an NCF Fluor 40 objective lens. Morpholino Antisense Oligonucleotides—NCIH292 cells were transfected according to the manufacturer's instructions with 2 μm solutions of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (Gene Tools LLC, Philomath, OR) corresponding to ADAM10, 5′-AATTAACACTCTCAGCAACACCATC-3′; ADAM15, 5′-AGAGCAGCGCCAGCCGCATGGCAGC-3′; ADAM 9, 5′-GAAAGCGCGCGCCAGACCCCATCTC-3′; or ADAM 17, 5′-TCAGGAATAGGAGAGACTGCCT-3′). Thirty h later, cells were lysed for ADAM immunoblot or stimulated with smoke or EGF. ADAM immunoblots were normalized for loading differences using β-actin and analyzed by densitometry (Image J 1.27 software). Stimulated cells were used for immunoprecipitation and phospho-EGFR immunoblot as described above. To approach the question of how smoke stimulates cell proliferation, we exposed both primary human bronchial epithelial cells and the lung tumor cell line NCIH292 to serum-free medium with or without smoke components (9Gebremichael A. Tullis K. Denison M. Cheek J. Pinkerton K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 76-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 4 h. Cell counts 48 h later revealed that cell number increased as a consequence of smoke exposure (Fig. 1, A and B). Associated with this was phosphorylation of the EGFR, which occurred during the first several minutes of smoke exposure (Fig. 2, A and B). That this was required for the stimulatory effect of smoke was indicated by a reduction of cell number in the presence of the EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG 1478 (Fig. 1, A and B). These effects occurred in the absence of extracellular ligand.Fig. 2Smoke stimulates phosphorylation of EGFR. A, primary human bronchial epithelial cells were incubated with SFM, smoke-containing SFM (SMK), or EGF (10 ng/ml)-containing SFM for 10 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody, immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and visualized by chemiluminescence. The lower panel shows results after the blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-EGFR. B, same experiment as in A using NCIH292 cells. C, NCIH292 cells grown on coverslips were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with or without smoke-containing medium or EGF (100 ng/ml). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with anti-EGFR antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG prior to viewing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although there have been prior reports of “ligand-independent” EGFR activation, the mechanism of activation is unclear. Following smoke exposure, we observed oligomerization and internalization of EGFR (Fig. 2C) with the same kinetics as that seen following administration of EGF itself (not shown). Oligomerization implies that smoke induces autophosphorylation of the receptor, a mode of activation inhibitable by AG 1478. It has only recently been appreciated that receptor activation in the absence of exogenous growth factor can nonetheless be growth factor-dependent. Thus, Ullrich and co-workers (10Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) showed that the transactivation of EGFR by G protein-coupled receptors was mediated by the metalloproteinase-dependent cleavage of HBEGF and its subsequent binding to EGFR. We recently showed that transactivation of EGFR by the bacterial outer membrane component LTA occurs by a similar mechanism (11Lemjabbar H. Basbaum C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism induced by smoke, we first asked whether ligand binding was required for the response. Results showing attenuation of receptor phosphorylation by antibody blockade of the ligand-binding site indicated that despite the absence of an extracellular ligand, ligand-receptor interaction was required for the response (Fig. 3A). Because EGFR ligands (amphiregulin, betacellulin, EGF, TGFα, HBEGF, and epiregulin) originate as transmembrane proteins that are cleaved and “shed” prior to receptor binding (12Riese D. Stern D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 13Carpenter G. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/15/pe1)PubMed Google Scholar, 14Leserer M. Gschwind A. Ullrich A.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), we next sought evidence for the possibility that smoke stimulated the shedding of ligand into the cell culture medium. The breast cancer cell line SKBR3 shows EGFR phosphorylation in response to soluble ligand but not to smoke, making the cells suitable “reporters” for smoke-induced ligand shedding. As shown (Fig. 3B), SKBR3 cells displayed strong receptor phosphorylation in response to the conditioned medium from smoke-exposed, but not unexposed, NCIH292 cells. This suggested that NCIH292 cells proteolytically cleaved and released ligand upon smoke exposure and that this ligand was transferred to SKBR cells in the conditioned medium. The cleavage of EGFR ligands is mediated, at least in some cases, by transmembrane metalloproteinases called ADAMs (16Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 17Blobel C.P. Inflamm. Res. 2002; 51: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consistent with the view that smoke stimulates ligand cleavage and release, we found that the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR by smoke but not EGF (Fig. 4A). When we exposed NCIH292 cells to smoke in the presence of antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to various ADAMs, we found that antisense ADAM 17 (tumor necrosis factor α converting enzyme) but not antisense ADAMs 9, 10, or 15 (data not shown for ADAMs 9 and 15) strongly attenuated smoke-induced phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 4B). Immunoblots monitoring the amount of ADAM present in the same cells confirmed that antisense inhibition was appropriate and specific (Fig. 4C). This implicated ADAM 17 in the response to smoke contrasting with earlier data implicating ADAM 10 in the response of the same cells to bacterial LTA (11Lemjabbar H. Basbaum C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although the basis for substrate specificity of the ADAMs is unclear, it is recognized that individual ADAMs may cleave more than a single substrate. ADAM 17 in particular has been shown to cleave several surface molecules including both TNFα and TGFα (18Peschon J. Slack J. Reddy P. Stocking K. Sunnarborg S. Lee D. Russell W. Castner B. Johnson R. Fitzner J. Boyce R. Nelson N. Kozlosky C. Wolfson M. Rauch C. Cerretti D. Paxton R. March C. Black R. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). To identify the ligand cleaved in response to smoke, we prepared immunoblots of medium from smoke-exposed NCIH292 cells. Although negative for the EGFR ligands epiregulin, HBEGF, betacellulin, and EGF, the blots showed that smoke but not LTA strongly stimulated the release of amphiregulin. The reverse was true for HBEGF (Fig. 4D). Small amounts of TGFα were also released by smoke (not shown). As expected, the presence of antisense ADAM 17 inhibited the ability of smoke to stimulate amphiregulin release (Fig. 4E). We next addressed the question of how smoke stimulates ADAM 17. Because both EGFR phosphorylation and metalloproteinase activation are known to be redox-sensitive (19Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir.

Atherosclerosis. 2001; 155: 45-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we asked whether oxygen radicals stimulate ADAM 17 to cleave amphiregulin. As shown (Fig. 5A), smoke exposure raised the levels of ROS in NCIH292 cells. Moreover, antioxidants N-acetyl-l-cysteine (a precursor of glutathione) or dimethylthiourea (an oxygen-radical scavenger) inhibited both ligand release and receptor activation (Fig. 5, B and C). Although the appearance of oxygen radicals in nonphagocytic cells is often associated with the diversion of oxygen species from mitochondrial electron transport, recent data show that intracellular radicals may also derive from a low activity NADPH oxidase (24Suh Y. Arnold R. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A. Griendling K. Lambeth J. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). To examine the relative importance of these two oxidant sources, we exposed cells to smoke in the presence of drugs known to inhibit electron transport (rotenone and antimycin A) or NADPH oxidase (diphenyliodonium chloride). The absence of detectable ROS in diphenyliodonium chloride-treated cells (Fig. 5D) implicated NADPH oxidase in the critical early response to tobacco smoke. Data in Fig. 5 collectively suggest that activation of this oxidase results in amphiregulin cleavage and EGFR phosphorylation, which was shown in Fig. 1 to be necessary for cell proliferation. To test the relevance of the above findings in an animal model, we exposed mice to smoke in a specially designed chamber (9Gebremichael A. Tullis K. Denison M. Cheek J. Pinkerton K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 76-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with results in vitro, tracheal lysates from mice exposed to smoke alone showed elevated phosphorylation of EGFR, whereas lysates from animals exposed to smoke in the presence of the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 did not (Fig. 6; compare with data in Fig. 4). These findings reveal mechanisms by which smoke stimulates the proliferation of human lung cells in vitro. Based on the results of experiments in animals, it seems likely that these findings mirror events in the lungs of human smokers (Fig. 6). The results fill a gap in our understanding of mechanisms mediating hyperproliferation in smokers' lungs (5Barsky S. Roth M. Kleerup E. Simmons M. Tashkin D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and, based on the link between proliferation and neoplasia (25Obara T. Tanno S. Fujii T. Izawa T. Mizukami Y. Yanagawa N.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6008-6017PubMed Google Scholar), contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of lung cancer. These studies also indicate that the ability of EGFR to integrate responses to diverse environmental stimuli depends on stimulus-specific activation of the various ADAMs. When epithelial cells activate EGFR in response to both bacteria (11Lemjabbar H. Basbaum C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and tobacco smoke (this study), they do so by different mechanisms (Fig. 7). In both cases, ADAMs are required, but one involves ADAM 10 and the other ADAM 17. Although the activation mechanisms for these proteases are unknown, our data, obtained in the same cell type using two different stimuli, indicate that these mechanisms are stimulus-specific. Whereas the choice of ADAM itself depends on the nature of the stimulus, the choice of transmembrane ligand would appear to depend upon (a) phenotype-dependent ligand expression and (b) substrate specificity of the activated ADAM. Our data clearly show that both HBEGF and amphiregulin are expressed in NCIH292 cells. Therefore, results showing that LTA elicits cleavage of HBEGF but not amphiregulin (11Lemjabbar H. Basbaum C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and that smoke does the opposite (this study) imply that HBEGF, but not amphiregulin, is a substrate for ADAM 10 and that amphiregulin, but not HBEGF, is a substrate for ADAM 17. Although these findings are in general agreement with evidence linking ADAM 17 to amphiregulin (29Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Stevenson M. Russell W.E. Raska C.S. Peschon J.J. Castner B.J.

Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), they are somewhat at odds with data showing that ADAM 17 is capable of cleaving both amphiregulin and HBEGF (29Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Stevenson M. Russell W.E. Raska C.S. Peschon J.J. Castner B.J. Gerhart M.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Lee D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12838-12845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Notably, however, the two sets of data were obtained from different cell types (mouse keratinocytes versus human lung epithelial cells). Phenotypic differences with respect to the abundance and location of ADAMs, ligands, and signaling molecules eliciting ADAM activity can be expected to affect the probability of any given cleavage reaction. Some disparity can be seen in our own results comparing the degree to which treatment of cells with antisense ADAM 17 inhibited smoke-induced EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 4B, almost complete response) versus ADAM 17 protein levels (Fig. 4C, ∼50% response). We attribute this to one or both of the following. 1) Western blot results are not necessarily linear with protein concentration, and 2) because of the (as yet unknown) subcellular distribution of ADAM 17, amphiregulin, and EGFR in NCIH292 cells, there may be a threshold concentration of ADAM 17 below which amphiregulin cleavage is insufficient to activate EGFR. In addition to implicating ADAM 17 in the response of lung cells to tobacco smoke, our findings also illustrate that the relevant activation mechanism is oxygen radical-dependent. Oxygen radical production in the setting of smoke exposure appears to be a result of the activation of NADPH oxidase. One possible scenario by which smoke could stimulate this enzyme is suggested by the finding that tobacco smoke induces mitochondrial depolarization (31Banzet N. Francois D. Polla B. Redox Rep. 1999; 4: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This would induce a transient deficiency in ATP production and stimulate compensatory glucose uptake. The conversion of glucose to bisphosphoglycerate would then lead to the production of NADH, which, via the action of a transhydrogenase enzyme, contributes to the formation of NADPH. This serves as a substrate and stimulus for NADPH oxidase. The uniformity of results obtained in both primary and tumor cells confirms the fundamental nature of the effect of smoke on EGFR and cell proliferation. Although it remains possible that details of the response to smoke differ in normal versus tumor cells, our data suggest that such differences are subtle. This is based on results showing that (a) smoke stimulates proliferation of both non-tumor and tumor cells (Fig. 1, A and B), (b) smoke stimulates EGFR phosphorylation in both cell types (Fig. 2, A and B), (c) there is a causal relationship between smoke-induced EGFR phosphorylation and cell proliferation in both cell types (Fig. 1, A and B), and (d) the mechanism of receptor activation by smoke is metalloproteinase-dependent in both tumor cells in vitro and in mouse tracheal epithelial cells in vivo (Figs. 4 and 6). In addition to their usefulness as a model, the tumor cell (NCIH292) experiments may directly indicate how smoke stimulates the growth of nascent tumors prior to a diagnosis of lung cancer. An understanding of these signals may suggest strategies to limit the tumorigenic effects of smoke on the lung. Finally, the phosphorylation of EGFR can be induced by an increasingly long list of environmental stimuli. Because of the role of EGFR in cell proliferation and the relationship between hyperproliferation and malignant transformation, elevated levels of EGFR phosphorylation in a tissue biopsy may identify tissues at risk for malignant transformation. In conjunction with this, it may be possible to identify tumor promoters based on their ability to stimulate the phosphorylation of EGFR in model systems. We thank Kent Pinkerton, Ph.D., and Dale Uyeminami, Ph.D., for providing smoke condensate-containing filters for this study."

To investigate whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan) could mitigate age-associated changes in kidney mitochondria, male Wistar rats (14 mo old) received during 8 mo water containing either enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) (Enal), or losartan (30 mg/kg/day) (Los), or no additions (Old). Four-month-old untreated rats (Young) were also studied. In Old rats mitochondrial respiratory control, ADP/O, nitric oxide synthase activity, and uncoupling protein 2 levels were lower (46, 42, 27, and 76%, respectively), and Mn-SOD activity was higher (70%) than in Young, Enal, and Los rats. In Old rats mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production was higher than in both Young (197%) and Enal or Los (40%) rats. In Old rats, kidney GSH/GSSG was lower than in both Young (80%) and Enal (57%) or Los (68%) rats. In Old rats electron microscopy showed effacement of microvilli in tubular epithelial cells, ill-defined mitochondrial cristae, lower mitochondrial numbers, and enhanced number of osmiophilic bodies relative to Young, Enal, or Los rats. In conclusion, enalapril and losartan can protect against both age-related mitochondrial dysfunction and ultrastructural alterations, underscoring the role of RAS in the aging process. An association with oxidative stress modulation is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1973241402,"Detailed structural information on human exchangeable apolipoproteins (apo) is required to understand their functions in lipid transport. Using a series of deletion mutants that progressively lacked different regions along the molecule, we probed the structural organization of lipid-free human apoA-I and the role of different domains in lipid binding, making comparisons to apoE, which is a member of the same gene family and known to have two structural domains. Measurements of α-helix content by CD in conjunction with tryptophan and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid fluorescence data demonstrated that deletion of the amino-terminal or central regions disrupts the tertiary organization, whereas deletion of the carboxyl terminus has no effect on stability and induces a more cooperative structure. These data are consistent with the lipid-free apoA-I molecule being organized into two structural domains similar to apoE; the amino-terminal and central parts form a helix bundle, whereas the carboxyl-terminal α-helices form a separate, less organized structure. The binding of the apoA-I variants to lipid emulsions is modulated by reorganization of the helix bundle structure, because the rate of release of heat on binding is inversely correlated with the stability of the helix bundle. Based on these observations, we propose that there is a two-step mechanism for lipid binding of apoA-I: apoA-I initially binds to a lipid surface through amphipathic α-helices in the carboxyl-terminal domain, followed by opening of the helix bundle in the amino-terminal domain. Because apoE behaves similarly, this mechanism is probably a general feature for lipid interaction of other exchangeable apolipoproteins, such as apoA-IV. Detailed structural information on human exchangeable apolipoproteins (apo) is required to understand their functions in lipid transport. Using a series of deletion mutants that progressively lacked different regions along the molecule, we probed the structural organization of lipid-free human apoA-I and the role of different domains in lipid binding, making comparisons to apoE, which is a member of the same gene family and known to have two structural domains.

Because apoE behaves similarly, this mechanism is probably a general feature for lipid interaction of other exchangeable apolipoproteins, such as apoA-IV. Exchangeable apolipoproteins (apo) 1The abbreviations used are: apo, apolipoprotein; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid; CD, circular dichroism; DMPC, dimyristoylphosphati-dylcholine; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; PC, phosphatidylcholine. play critical roles in lipid transport and lipoprotein metabolism. This class of proteins (which includes human apoA, -C, and -E) have the same genomic structure and are members of a multigene family that probably evolved from a common ancestral gene (1Li W.H. Tanimura M. Luo C.C. Datta S. Chan L. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 245-271Google Scholar). The last exon codes for a primary structure of 22-amino acid tandem repeats that are often separated by a proline residue. The 22-residue segments form amphipathic α-helices that mediate the interaction of these proteins with lipids (2Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 303-369Google Scholar). Knowledge of apolipoprotein tertiary structure in the absence and presence of lipid is needed to understand their functions at the molecular level. Given the common evolution, it might be expected that apolipoprotein molecules containing multiple 22-residue repeats (e.g. apoA-I and apoE) fold similarly to adopt a common domain structure. However, this concept has not been established because, as outlined below, current knowledge of apolipoprotein tertiary structure is rudimentary. High resolution structures for intact human apolipoprotein in the lipid-free state are not available. ApoE is perhaps the best defined because the crystal structure for the 22-kDa amino-terminal fragment was solved over a decade ago (3Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Google Scholar). This domain forms a globular α-helix bundle that is similar to the structure of insect apolipophorin III (4Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Google Scholar). In apoE, there are two independently folded domains: the 22-kDa amino-terminal domain contains the low density lipoprotein receptor binding region and the 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain has a high affinity for lipid and is responsible for lipoprotein binding (5Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that these two domains in apoE4 lead to two different lipid-bound conformations, providing a structural rationale for the variable receptor binding activity displayed by lipoprotein-associated apoE (6Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Google Scholar). In comparison, the tertiary structure of apoA-I is relatively poorly defined. Thus, various spectroscopic and proteolysis measurements are consistent with a helix bundle structure for apoA-I in solution (7Davidson W.S. Hazlett T. Mantulin W.W. Jonas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13605-13610Google Scholar, 8Roberts L.M. Ray M.J. Shih T.W. Hayden E. Reader M.M. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7615-7624Google Scholar, 9Kiss R.S. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4327-4334Google Scholar). However, the α-helices are in a linear conformation in the crystal structure of an amino-terminal-truncated apoA-I molecule (10Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Google Scholar). Also, in contrast to apoE (11Morrow J.A. Segall M.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Knapp M. Rupp B. Weisgraber K.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11657-11666Google Scholar), guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced denaturation of apoA-I is monophasic (12Reijngoud D.J. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2969-2976Google Scholar), giving no evidence for separate unfolding of two domains. Indeed, the apoA-I molecule may not have a defined tertiary structure, because it exhibits characteristics of a molten globule (13Gursky O. Atkinson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2991-2995Google Scholar). The structural plasticity (14Rogers D.P. Roberts L.M. Lebowitz J. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 945-955Google Scholar) facilitates lipid-binding with the carboxyl-terminal domain playing a key role (for reviews, see Refs. 15Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Google Scholar, 16Frank P.G. Marcel Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 853-872Google Scholar, 17Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Engler J.A. Borhani D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1531: 4-46Google Scholar). We further examined the domain structure of apoA-I so that a systematic comparison with apoE could be made. To this end, we characterized six deletion mutants that progressively lack different regions along the molecule, amino-terminal (Δ1–43, Δ44–65, and Δ44–126), central (Δ123–166), or carboxyl-terminal (Δ190–243 and Δ223–243) regions of apoA-I. The results show that the two-domain model of apoE structure applies to apoA-I and that both proteins undergo a similar two-step mechanism of binding to a lipid surface. These findings support the notion that the tertiary structures of the larger members of the human exchangeable apolipoprotein gene family are related. Expression and Purification of Proteins—To express human apoA-I and engineered variants, the cDNA of interest was cloned into multiple cloning sites of the pET32a (+) vector, and the target protein was expressed as a fusion protein with the 109-amino acid thioredoxin at the amino terminus. The pET32a (+) vector contains the ampicillin resistance gene for clonal selection and a His-tag at the fusion linker region to facilitate purification of the expressed protein using a nickel affinity column. In addition, a thrombin recognition site was engineered at the fusion junction in such a way that thrombin cleavage of the thioredoxin leaves the target protein with two extra amino acids, Gly-Ser, at the amino terminus (18Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Google Scholar). The transformed expression host, Escherichia coli strain BL21–DE3, was grown in Luria Bertani medium, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. After the cell pellet was sonicated and centrifuged to sediment the cell debris, the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-chelating, histidine binding resin column. The thioredoxin-apoA-I fusion protein bound to the column was eluted, pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm NH4HCO3, complexed with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), and cleaved with thrombin. The apoA-I was then lyophilized and delipidated, dissolved in 6 m GdnHCl, and separated from the fusion protein thioredoxin by gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography (18Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Google Scholar). The apoA-I preparations were at least 95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE. Plasma apoA-I was isolated from human high density lipoprotein (19Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M. Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Holvoet P. Dhoest A. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Weisgraber K.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2021-2028Google Scholar). The human apoE4 and its 22-kDa fragment were expressed and purified as described (6Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—The average secondary structures of the apoA-I variants were determined by obtaining CD spectra at room temperature using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter. The proteins dissolved in 6 m GdnHCl were dialyzed overnight against excess 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and diluted to 25–50 μg/ml for CD analysis. The α-helix content was calculated from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm, as described (20Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Google Scholar); similar values for the α-helix content were also derived by a singular value decomposition of the CD spectrum (21Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Google Scholar). The thermal denaturation was monitored from the change in molar ellipticity at 222 nm over the temperature range 20–90 °C, as described (22Acharya P. Segall M.L. Zaiou M. Morrow J. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Snow J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 9-19Google Scholar). The cooperativity index, n, describing the sigmoidicity of the thermal denaturation curve was calculated by applying the Hill equation, n = log 81/log (T0.9/T0.1), where T0.1 and T0.9 are the temperatures where the fractional completions of the unfolding transition are 0.1 and 0.9, respectively. The equilibrium constants of denaturation, KD, at each temperature were derived from the measured molar ellipticity at each temperature and the molar ellipticities of the native and denatured forms of the protein, as described (20Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Google Scholar). The van't Hoff enthalpy, ΔHv, was calculated from the slope of the line fitted by linear regression to the equation, ln KD = – (ΔHv/R) 1/T + constant, where R is the gas constant and T is temperature. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 25 °C. In all experiments, the apoA-I was freshly dialyzed from 6 m GdnHCl solution into Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) before use. To determine the wavelength of maximum fluorescence (WMF) of intrinsic Trp residues, the emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm using a 295-nm excitation wavelength to avoid tyrosine fluorescence. For monitoring chemical denaturation by WMF, proteins at concentrations of 50–100 μg/ml were incubated overnight at 4 °C with GdnHCl at various concentrations. KD at a given GdnHCl concentration were calculated with WMF being used instead of ellipticity in the equation for KD (20Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Google Scholar). The free energy of denaturation, ΔGD°, the midpoint of denaturation, D1/2, and m value, which reflects the cooperativity of denaturation in the transition region, were determined by the linear equation, ΔGD = ΔGD° – m[GdnHCl], where ΔGD = – RT ln KD. In fluorescence quenching experiments, the emission spectra of proteins were recorded at increasing concentrations of KI (0–0.45 m) using a 5-m stock solution containing 1 mm NaS2O3 to prevent the formation of iodine. After correction for dilution, the integrated fluorescence intensities were fitted to the modified Stern-Volmer equation, F0/(F0 – F) = 1/fa + 1/faKsv[KI], where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively, fa is the fraction of Trp residues accessible to the quencher, and Ksv is the Stern-Volmer constant. 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescence spectra were collected from 400 to 600 nm at an excitation wavelength of 395 nm in the presence of 50 μg/ml protein and an excess of ANS (250 μm). DMPC Clearance Assay—The kinetics of solubilization of DMPC multilamellar vesicles by the apoA-I variants were measured by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 325 nm, as described before (23Segall M.L. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Anantharamaiah G.M. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1688-1700Google Scholar). The time courses of decrease in absorbance with time were fitted to a monoexponential decay equation, and the clearance rates were compared in terms of the product (rate constant × fraction of absorbance cleared at equilibrium) normalized to the value for native apoA-I. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Measurements—Triolein-egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) emulsion particles (average particle diameter determined by quasi-elastic light scattering measurements was 110 ± 10 nm) were prepared by sonication and purified by ultracentrifugation as described (6Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Google Scholar). Heats of apoA-I binding to emulsions were measured with a MicroCal MCS isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) at 25 °C. To ensure that the injected protein bound completely to the emulsion surface, the PC to protein molar ratio was kept over 10,000. The decay rate constants for the heats of binding were obtained from fitting the titration curves to a one-phase exponential decay model. CD Analysis of ApoA-I Variants—Far-UV CD spectra of apoA-I variants were used to determine the average α-helix content in the lipid-free structures (Table I). Compared with WT apoA-I (α-helix content of 46% and 113 α-helical residues), significant reductions in the number of α-helical residues were observed in all deletion mutants except for Δ190–243. The fact that all the other deletions cause a reduction in the number of α-helical residues implies that they all include α-helical domains, assuming that no compensatory changes in conformation occur upon removal of the specified amino acids. In the case of Δ44–126, the fact that 71 of the 83 residues removed are α-helical residues indicates that this region of the apoA-I molecule largely forms an α-helical structure (7Davidson W.S. Hazlett T. Mantulin W.W. Jonas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13605-13610Google Scholar, 8Roberts L.M. Ray M.J. Shih T.W. Hayden E. Reader M.M. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7615-7624Google Scholar). The central region apparently contains a significant amount of nonhelical structure (24Gorshkova I.N. Liu T. Zannis V.I. Atkinson D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10529-10539Google Scholar) because only 13 of the 44 residues removed in Δ123–166 are helical (Table I). Although the carboxyl-terminal deletion Δ223–243 reduces the number of helical residues, the larger carboxyl-terminal deletion Δ190–243 results in an essentially unaltered number of residues in a helical conformation. This suggests that the carboxyl-terminal region (residues 190–243) is predominantly a nonhelical structure (7Davidson W.S. Hazlett T. Mantulin W.W. Jonas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13605-13610Google Scholar, 8Roberts L.M. Ray M.J. Shih T.W. Hayden E. Reader M.M. Brouillette C.G.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows the thermal unfolding curves of plasma, Δ44–126, and Δ190–243 apoA-I monitored by the ellipticity at 222 nm. The shapes of the curves indicate that the deletion Δ44–126 significantly decreases the cooperativity of unfolding, whereas the deletion Δ190–243 increases the cooperativity compared with plasma apoA-I. Table I gives the values of the midpoint temperature, Tm, the cooperativity index, and the van't Hoff enthalpy, ΔHv, of thermal unfolding. Deletions of Δ44–65, Δ44–126, or Δ123–166 cause a large decrease in Tm, indicating that deletions of these regions markedly destabilize the protein structure. Comparison of the cooperativity index and ΔHv indicates that deletions of the amino-terminal or central regions result in a significant reduction in the cooperativity of unfolding, whereas the carboxyl-terminal deletion increases the cooperativity. Fig. 1 also shows the thermal unfolding curves of apoE4 and its 22-kDa fragment for comparison (11Morrow J.A. Segall M.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Knapp M. Rupp B. Weisgraber K.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11657-11666Google Scholar). Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain in apoE resulted in an increase in the percent α-helix content and an increase in the cooperativity index (Table I) similar to the effects of deletion of residues 190–243 in apoA-I. Fluorescence Studies of ApoA-I Variants—To compare the structure and stability of the amino-terminal region among the apoA-I variants, we measured Trp fluorescence because the four Trp residues are located in the amino-terminal half of apoA-I (positions 8, 50, 72, and 108). Because all of the Trp residues exist in similar hydrophobic environments in a folded protein structure (27Davidson W.S. Arnvig-McGuire K. Kennedy A. Kosman J. Hazlett T.L. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14387-14395Google Scholar), monitoring Trp fluorescence is useful to probe the conformation of the amino-terminal half of the protein, although some deletion mutants are variously missing certain Trp residues. Fig. 2 shows GdnHCl-induced denaturation curves of the apoA-I variants monitored by wavelength of maximum fluorescence of Trp emission spectra. The conformational stability, ΔGD°, the midpoint of denaturation, D1/2, and m values derived from the linear plots of the Gibbs free energy, ΔGD, versus denaturant concentration (Fig. 2, inset), are listed in Table II. Plasma and wild-type apoA-I exhibit a midpoint of denaturation of 1.0 m, consistent with earlier results using the ellipticity at 222 nm (12Reijngoud D.J. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2969-2976Google Scholar, 20Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Google Scholar). Deletions of the amino-terminal (Δ1–43, Δ44–65, or Δ44–126) or central (Δ123–166) regions lead to a large reduction in ΔGD°, D1/2, and m values, indicating that deletions of these regions decrease the stability and the unfolding cooperativity of the amino-terminal half of apoA-I. In contrast, values of these parameters for Δ190–243 and Δ223–243 are close to native apoA-I, suggesting that carboxyl-terminal deletion has no effect on the tertiary structure of the amino-terminal half of the molecule.Table IIParameters of GdnHCl-induced denaturation, KI quenching, and ANS binding of apoA-I deletion mutants determined from fluorescence measurement at 25 °CApoA-I variantThermodynamic parameters of denaturationQuenching by KIaParameters of Trp fluorescence quenching: fa, fraction of Trp residues accessible to I-, Ksv, Stern-Volmer constant.ANS fluorescence intensitybValues are ratios to plasma apoA-I.

Open table in a new tab To determine the relative exposures of Trp residues to the aqueous environment, KI quenching studies were performed. As shown in Table II, similar values of the quenching parameters for plasma, wild-type, Δ1–43, Δ44–65, Δ190–243, and Δ223–243 apoA-I were obtained, indicating similar exposure of Trp residues to solvent in these proteins. A decrease in fa for Δ123–166 and an increase in Ksv for Δ44–126 compared with native apoA-I indicate that Trp residues in Δ123–166 are less exposed to solvent, whereas Trp-8 in Δ44–126 is more exposed. The fluorescence emission of ANS is known to increase when bound to an accessible hydrophobic surface or a cavity of a protein (28Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Google Scholar). Compared with free ANS, a significant increase in fluorescence spectra was observed in the presence of native apoA-I, in contrast to the case of carbonic anhydrase, a stable folded globular protein (Fig. 3) (9Kiss R.S. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4327-4334Google Scholar, 29Rogers D.P. Brouillette C.G. Engler J.A. Tendian S.W. Roberts L. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Ray M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 288-300Google Scholar). As seen in Table II, deletions of the amino-terminal or central regions induce a large enhancement in ANS fluorescence compared with native apoA-I, indicating that there is much more hydrophobic surface accessible to ANS in these variants. In contrast, a reduction in ANS fluorescence for Δ190–243 and Δ223–243 suggests that carboxyl-terminal deletion decreases the exposed hydrophobic surface in apoA-I. A similar effect of carboxyl-terminal deletion on ANS fluorescence was also observed in apoE4 (Fig. 3, inset). Taken together, these results demonstrating the distinct effects of deletions in the amino-terminal half or the carboxyl terminus of the apoA-I structure strongly suggest that the lipid-free apoA-I molecule is organized into two structural domains similar to apoE. The amino-terminal and central parts form a helix bundle, whereas the carboxyl-terminal α-helices form a separate, less organized structure (7Davidson W.S. Hazlett T. Mantulin W.W. Jonas A. Proc.

Lipid Interaction of ApoA-I Variants—We used a DMPC clearance assay to examine the relative contributions of the putative two structural domains in apoA-I to lipid binding. As shown in Table III, Δ190–243 and Δ223–243 exhibited much slower kinetics of solubilization than native apoA-I, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I plays a key role in lipid binding (7Davidson W.S.

Interestingly, disruption of the helix bundle by the amino-terminal or central deletions gives faster clearance than native apoA-I, presumably because of more rapid conformational rearrangement of these proteins (23Segall M.L.

We have shown previously that 15d-PGJ2 is a potent electrophile that causes intracellular oxidative stress and redox alteration in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In the present study, based on the observation that the electrophilic center of 15d-PGJ2 was involved in the pro-oxidant effect, we investigated the role of thioredoxin 1 (Trx), an endogenous redox regulator, against 15d-PGJ2-induced oxidative cell injury. It was observed that the 15d-PGJ2-induced oxidative stress was significantly suppressed by the Trx overexpression. In addition, the treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 resulted in the formation of a 15d-PGJ2-Trx adduct, indicating that 15d-PGJ2 directly modified the endogenous Trx in the cells. To further examine the mechanism of the 15d-PGJ2 modification of Trx, human recombinant Trx treated with 15d-PGJ2 was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the 15d-PGJ2-treated human recombinant Trx demonstrated the addition of one molecule of 15d-PGJ2 per protein molecule. Moreover, the electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis identified two cysteine residues, Cys-35 and Cys-69, as the targets of 15d-PGJ2.

PGs are derived from fatty acids, primarily arachidonate, which are released from membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipases. Arachidonate is first converted to an unstable endoperoxide intermediate by cyclooxygenase and subsequently converted into one of several related products, including PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, prostacyclin, and thromboxane A2, through the action of specific PG synthetases. Among them, PGD2 is a major cyclooxygenase product in a variety of tissues and cells and has marked effects on a number of biological processes, including platelet aggregation, relaxation of vascular and nonvascular smooth muscles, and nerve cell functions (3Giles H. Leff P. Prostaglandins. 1988; 35: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PGD2 readily undergoes dehydration in vivo and in vitro to yield biologically active PGs of the J2 series, such as PGJ2, Δ12-PGJ2, and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) (4Fitzpatrick F.A.

Trx is an essential cofactor electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase but also has many other cellular functions, including regulation of transcription factors and apoptosis, and can act exogenously as a redox active growth factor (18Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). In addition, Trx is known to play important roles in the redox regulation of signal transduction and in cytoprotection against oxidative stress (23Yodoi J. Uchiyama T. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of Trx resides in its active site where the two redox-active cysteine residues (Cys-32 and Cys-35) undergo reversible oxidation/reduction. In addition to the conserved cysteine residues in the active site, three additional structural cysteine residues (Cys-62, Cys-69, and Cys-73) are present in the structure of the human Trx. The mechanisms for the reducing action of Trx is that substrate (X-S2) binds to a conserved hydrophobic surface and, in the hydrophobic environment of the complex, the thiolate of Cys-32, acting as a nucleophile, combines with the protein substrate to form a covalently linked mixed disulfide (-Cys-32-S-S-X). Finally, the deprotonated Cys-35 attacks the -Cys-32-S-S-X disulfide bond, releasing the reduced protein substrate and forming Trx-Cys-32-Cys-35-disulfide, which is then reduced by Trx reductase (25Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In our previous study, based on an extensive screening of diverse chemical agents on the induction of intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we identified cyclopentenone PGs, such as 15d-PGJ2, as the potential inducers of intracellular oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (14Kondo M. Oya-Ito T. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12076-12083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As the intracellular events associated with the PG-induced oxidative stress, we observed (i) the cellular redox alteration represented by depletion of antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, (ii) a transient decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ), (iii) the production of protein-bound lipid peroxidation products, such as acrolein and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and (iv) the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. In addition, the thiol compound, N-acetylcysteine, significantly inhibited the PG-induced ROS production, thereby preventing cytotoxicity. These observations suggested that the redox alteration was closely related to the pro-oxidant effect of the cyclopentenone PGs. In the present study, to investigate the correlation between the redox regulation and 15d-PGJ2-induced oxidative stress and to establish the cellular mechanism for protection against the endogenous electrophile, we investigated the role of Trx in 15d-PGJ2-induced oxidative cell injury.

Cells were incubated with 10 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (dissolved in Me2SO) for 30 min at 37 °C and then treated with different agents for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. After chilling on ice, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped from the plate, and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in PBS containing 10 mm EDTA. The fluorescence was measured using a flow cytometer (Epics XL, Beckman Coulter). Preparation of Biotinylated 15d-PGJ 2 —The carboxyl group of 15d-PGJ2 was modified by amidation with EZ-link 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine by a modification of a previously described procedure (16Cernuda-Morollon E.

Biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 was purified through a reverse-phase HPLC eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid.

The cells were then incubated for 1 h in the presence of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), rinsed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and covered with anti-fade solution. Images of the cellular immunofluorescence were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoroview; Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a ×40 objective (488-nm excitation and 518-nm emission). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). A gel was transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with Block Ace (40 mg/ml) for blocking, and washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween). This procedure was followed by the addition of HRP-conjugated NeutrAvidin or anti-mouse IgG antibody and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were visualized by Cool Saver AE-6955 (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Stable Transfection with Trx in SH-SY5Y Cells—SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with pcTrx-1 vector or with the vector alone using GenePORTER™ transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc.). In these experiments, 1 × 106 cells were incubated with DNA-GenePORTER™ mixture (2 μg of DNA/10 μl of GenePORTER™) in 1 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. After 6 h of incubation, 1 ml of complete medium was added, and cells were cultured for 18 h. Thereafter, stable transfectants were isolated by selection on 500 μg/ml G418 for ∼3 weeks. Single clones of the stably transfected cells were isolated by limiting dilution. Several G418-resistant stable clones were maintained in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. Biotinylated 15d-PGJ 2 Labeling of Trx in SH-SY5Y Cells—SH-SY5Y cells at 50% confluence were incubated with 50 μm biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS, harvested, and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton, plus protease inhibitors. Cell lysates containing 200 μg of protein were incubated batch-wise with 50 μl of NeutrAvidin-Plus beads overnight at 4 °C with constant shaking. The beads were rinsed three times with lysis buffer by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 1 min. The proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunodetection with anti-Trx monoclonal antibody. In addition, the cell lysates were incubated with 3 μg of anti-Trx antibody overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was then treated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged (2,000 rpm, 5 min), rinsed three times with lysis buffer, and then boiled with the Laemmli sample buffer, and the biotinylated proteins were then subjected to immunoblot and detection with HRP-conjugated NeutrAvidin and ECL. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—To coat the wells of the microtiter plate, 100 μl/well hrTrx (0.1 mg/ml) in PBS was used and then incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following washing with TBS/Tween, 100 μl of the biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 solution was added to the wells. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C followed by washing with TBS/Tween, each well was filled with 200 μl of Block Ace solution (4 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. The HRP-conjugated NeutrAvidin was then added to the wells at 100 μl/well for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, 100 μl of 0.05 m citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine and 0.003% H2O2 was added and incubated for several minutes at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 492 nm was read on a micro-ELISA plate reader. Titration of Trx Sulfhydryls with DTNB—The reactivity of the sulfhydryl groups in hrTrx was determined by titration with DTNB by the method of Ellman (30Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21419) Google Scholar), as modified by Riddles et al. (31Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). A 0.1 mg/ml hrTrx sample was treated with 0.1 mm 15d-PGJ2, and after dialysis against PBS, the protein was denatured with 8 m guanidine hydrochloride containing 13 mm EDTA and 133 mm Tris, pH 8, and reacted with DTNB (1 mm) at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was monitored as an increase in absorbance at 412 nm. The concentration of sulfhydryl groups was calculated using a standard curve with N-acetylcysteine. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)—The native and 15d-PGJ2-modified hrTrx were mixed with a saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) containing 75% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and dried on stainless steel targets at room temperature and pressure. The trypsin-digested hrTrx were mixed with a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) containing 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and dried on stainless steel targets at room temperature and pressure. The analyses were performed using an Autoflex matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). All analyses were in the positive ion mode, and the instrument was calibrated immediately prior to each series of studies. Electrospray Ionization-Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (ESI-LC/MS/MS) Analysis—The ESI-LC/MS (and ESI-LC/MS/MS) analyses were performed on an LCQ ion trap mass system (ThermoQuest) equipped with an electrospray ion source. The electrospray system employed a 5-kV spray voltage and a capillary temperature of 260 °C. Peptide Mapping—The native and 15d-PGJ2-modified hrTrx (1 mg/ml) were digested with modified trypsin in 0.25 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8, at 37 °C for 24 h using an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w). Peptide samples were analyzed by a reversed-phase HPLC, a system that consisted of a nanospace SI-1 HPLC system (SHISEIDO Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a FP-1520 fluorescence detector (Jasco Co., Tokyo, Japan), using a Capcell Pak C18 UG120 column (2.0 × 250-mm inner diameter; SHISEIDO Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). These samples were eluted with a linear gradient of water containing 0.1% formic acid (Solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.08% formic acid (Solvent B) (time = 0–3 min, 10% B; 3–45 min, 10–40% B; 45–50 min, 40–50% B; 50–52 min, 50–80% B). The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, and the column temperature was controlled at 40 °C. The chromatograms were recorded at 215 nm. Pro-oxidant and Cytotoxic Effects of 15d-PGJ 2 Can Be Attributed to Its Electrophilic Center—It has been suggested that the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentenone ring of 15d-PGJ2 is a prerequisite for the induction of intracellular oxidative stress and cytotoxicity (14Kondo M. Oya-Ito T. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12076-12083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To prove this hypothesis, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to 15d-PGJ2 and its analog 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 1A), and induction of ROS production and cytotoxicity were examined. As shown in Fig. 1B, the intracellular ROS production in SH-SY5Y cells was induced by 15d-PGJ2 in a dose-dependent manner. The level of ROS in the cells exposed to 15d-PGJ2 (50 μm) was ∼30-fold higher than that of the control. In contrast to this potent pro-oxidant effect of 15d-PGJ2, 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ2 had no significant effects on the ROS production. In a manner similar to the induction of the ROS production, 15d-PGJ2 (20 μm) resulted in a rapid decrease in the MTT reduction levels to 10% of the basal levels after 24 h of exposure, whereas the MTT reduction levels were maintained at about basal level in the cells exposed to 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the reduction of the double bond in the cyclopentenone ring of 15d-PGJ2 virtually abolished the pro-oxidant and cytotoxic effects of 15d-PGJ2, indicating that these biological activities can be attributed to the electrophilic center of 15d-PGJ2. Although proliferative effects of cyclopentenone-type PGs have been described in several cell types when used at nanomolar or low micromolar concentrations (32Chinery R. Coffey R.J. Graves-Deal R.

Cell Biol. 1987; 55: 18-27PubMed Google Scholar), we did not see such effect in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1C). Effect of Trx Overexpression on 15d-PGJ 2 -induced Oxidative Stress—The fact that cyclopentenone PGs are susceptible to nucleophilic addition reactions with thiols suggests that the action of the cyclopentenone PGs are closely related to the direct reaction with glutathione and/or other thiol compounds. However, l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine, a specific inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, itself, did not so effectively induce intracellular ROS production and cell death, indicating that the effects of the cyclopentenone PGs may not merely result from glutathione depletion alone (14Kondo M. Oya-Ito T. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12076-12083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This and the finding that the electrophilic center of 15d-PGJ2 is involved in the prooxidant effect (Fig. 1) suggested that other cellular redox molecules might play crucial roles in protection against 15d-PGJ2-induced oxidative cell injury. Based on the previous findings that Trx, a key molecule in the maintenance of cellular redox balance, plays critical roles in protecting against oxidative stress and mediating signal transduction (35Powis G. Mustacich D. Coon A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of this redox regulator on the 15d-PGJ2-induced ROS production. To this end, we established the Trx-overexpressing derivatives of SH-SY5Y cells by stable transfection with Trx cDNA. The Trx expression vector (pcTrx-1) was introduced into the SH-SY5Y cells with the selectable pcDNA, and four clones with resistance to G418 were selected. As a control, SH-SY5Y cells transfected with a control vector were similarly selected for G418 resistance. Four clones were isolated. As shown in Fig. 2A, the Trx-transfected clones Trx-1 and Trx-3 demonstrated a readily detectable expression of the Trx protein by immunoblot analysis with the anti-Trx monoclonal antibody, whereas the control transfected cells Neo-1, -2, -3, and -4 did not. For the experiments shown below, the results were compared between Neo-2 and Trx-3, to assess the effectiveness of expressed Trx in protection against 15d-PGJ2-induced cell injury. First, we measured the intracellular ROS production by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, the ROS production in the control SH-SY5Y was significantly induced by 15d-PGJ2. The level of ROS in the cells exposed to 15d-PGJ2 (50 μm) was about 5-fold higher than that of the vehicle-treated cells, whereas the intracellular ROS production in the Trx-overexpressed cells exposed to 15d-PGJ2 was inhibited about 40% of the vector control. Next, we examined the effect of Trx on the 15d-PGJ2-induced cytotoxicity. The transfected SH-SY5Y cells were examined by MTT assay for sensitivity to cytotoxicity induced by continuous exposure (24 h) to 15d-PGJ2. As shown in Fig. 2C, 15d-PGJ2 (5 or 10 μm) resulted in a decrease in the MTT reduction levels to 10% of the basal levels on vector control cells within 24 h of exposure, whereas the Trx-overexpressing cells were more resistant to 15d-PGJ2-induced cell death than the control cells. We also examined the effect of Trx overexpression on the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and p53, both of which have been suggested to be involved in the 15d-PGJ2-induced cell death (14Kondo M. Oya-Ito T. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12076-12083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15Kondo M. Shibata T. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Shibata N.

A. 2002; 99: 7367-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and found that Trx could have significantly inhibited the accumulation of these proteins (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that Trx may be involved, at least in part, in the protection against the 15d-PGJ2 cytotoxicity. Covalent Binding of 15d-PGJ 2 to Endogenous Trx in SH-SY5Y Cells—Because Trx contains reactive sulfhydryl groups, it can be hypothesized that Trx may directly react with 15d-PGJ2. Apart from low molecular weight 15d-PGJ2-glutathione adduct, the 15d-PGJ2-thiol conjugates are associated with high molecular weight proteins. The list of 15d-PGJ2-modified proteins so far includes IκB kinase (10Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G.

To determine whether 15d-PGJ2 reacts with Trx or other proteins, we prepared a biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 3A), which retains the α,β-unsaturated keto"
https://openalex.org/W2055238728,"We recently demonstrated that elevation of intracellular glucosylceramide (GlcCer) levels results in increased functional Ca2+ stores in cultured neurons, and suggested that this may be due to modulation of ryanodine receptors (RyaRs) by GlcCer (Korkotian, E., Schwarz, A., Pelled, D., Schwarzmann, G., Segal, M. and Futerman, A. H. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 21673–21678). We now systematically examine the effects of exogenously added GlcCer, other glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and their lyso-derivatives on Ca2+ release from rat brain microsomes. GlcCer had no direct effect on Ca2+ release, but rather augmented agonist-stimulated Ca2+ release via RyaRs, through a mechanism that may involve the redox sensor of the RyaR, but had no effect on Ca2+ release via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. Other GSLs and sphingolipids, including galactosylceramide, lactosylceramide, ceramide, sphingomyelin, sphingosine 1-phosphate, sphinganine 1-phosphate, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine had no effect on Ca2+ mobilization from rat brain microsomes, but both galactosylsphingosine (psychosine) and glucosylsphingosine stimulated Ca2+ release, although only galactosylsphingosine mediated Ca2+ release via the RyaR. Finally, we demonstrated that GlcCer levels were ∼10-fold higher in microsomes prepared from the temporal lobe of a type 2 Gaucher disease patient compared with a control, and Ca2+ release via the RyaR was significantly elevated, which may be of relevance for explaining the pathophysiology of neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease. We recently demonstrated that elevation of intracellular glucosylceramide (GlcCer) levels results in increased functional Ca2+ stores in cultured neurons, and suggested that this may be due to modulation of ryanodine receptors (RyaRs) by GlcCer (Korkotian, E., Schwarz, A., Pelled, D., Schwarzmann, G., Segal, M. and Futerman, A.

Of the signaling pathways regulated by SLs, Ca2+ homeostasis has received wide attention due largely to observations that sphingosine, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine modulate Ca2+-homeostasis via the edg receptors, a class of plasma membrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (3Meyer zu Heringdorf D.

Recent studies (reviewed in Ref. 14Ledeen R.W. Wu G. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 637-647Google Scholar) have shown that complex GSLs, such as ganglioside GM1, can potentiate the activity of a nuclear envelope Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (15Xie X. Wu G. Lu Z.H. Ledeen R.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1185-1195Google Scholar), and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) can be modulated by gangliosides GM1 and GM3 (16Wang Y. Tsui Z. Yang F. Glycoconj.

In the current study we systematically examine the effects of GlcCer, other GSLs and their lyso-derivatives on Ca2+ release from isolated rat brain microsomes, and demonstrate that GlcCer and its lyso-derivative, glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) (Fig. 1), both modulate Ca2+ release but via different molecular mechanisms, and by a different mechanism to that of galactosylsphingosine (GalSph), none of which involve GPCRs. Moreover, Ca2+ release was also enhanced in human brain microsomes obtained from a type 2 Gaucher disease patient, in which GlcCer levels are elevated ∼10-fold.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—C8-GlcCer (N-octanoyl-d-glucosylsphingosine), C8-galactosylceramide (C8-GalCer; N-octanoyl-d-galactosylsphingosine) and C8-lactosylceramide (C8-LacCer; N-octanoyl-d-lactosylsphingosine) werefrom Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL.

After centrifugation (700 × gav, 10 min), the resulting pellet (P1) was gently resuspended in one-fourth of the original volume of buffer A, centrifuged (700 × gav, 10 min), and the two supernatants pooled (S1). Mitochondria were removed by centrifugation (8,000 × gav, 45 min) of S1 and the resulting supernatant (S2) centrifuged (115,000 × gav, 90 min) to obtain a microsomal pellet (P3), which was resuspended in 0.4–0.8 ml of buffer A. Protein was determined (27Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), and the microsomes subsequently flash-frozen in liquid N2. Microsomes were stored at –80 °C and used for up to six months after their preparation, during which time there was no change in their activity with respect to Ca2+ release and uptake.Human brain microsomes were prepared exactly as described for rat brain microsomes. Microsomes were prepared from a control human brain of a young adult and from the brain of a type 2 Gaucher patient who died at 1 year of age.Spectrophotometric Assay of Ca2+Uptake and Release—Ca2+ uptake and release was measured by a spectrophotometric assay using the Ca2+-sensitive dye, antipyrylazo III (26Betto R. Teresi A. Turcato F. Salviati G. Sabbadini R.A. Krown K. Glembotski C.C. Kindman L.A. Dettbarn C. Pereon Y. Yasui K. Palade P.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 327-333Google Scholar, 28Palade P. J. Biol.

Brain microsomes (330 μg in 8–15 μl of buffer A) were added to 0.95 ml of 8 mm NaMOPS, pH 7.0, 40 mm KCl, 62.5 mm K2HPO4, and 250 μm antipyrylazo III, in a plastic cuvette containing a magnetic stir bar, to which 1 mm MgATP, 40 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 5 mm phosphocreatine, pH 7.0, were added. Ca2+ uptake and release were measured in a Cary spectrophotometer (Varian Australia Pty Ltd.) at 37 °C by subtracting the absorbance at A790 from A710 at 2-s intervals.The effect of GSLs and lyso-GSLs was tested by their addition either prior to or after Ca2+ loading (see for example, Fig. 2). C8-GSLs and lyso-GSLs were dissolved in absolute ethanol, and LC-GSLs were dissolved in ethanol/dodecane (98:2, v/v) (31Ji L. Zhang G. Uematsu S. Akahori Y. Hirabayashi Y. FEBS Letts. 1995; 358: 211-214Google Scholar, 32Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 219-226Google Scholar). The final ethanol or ethanol/dodecane concentration did not exceed 2% (v/v) in the cuvette. Sphingosine-1-phosphate and sphinganine-1-phosphate were added as a complex with defatted bovine serum albumin (4:1, mol/mol). Sphingosylphosphorylcholine was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Pertussis toxin A protomer (1 μg/ml) was added in a solution containing NAD (25 μm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (0.002%, w/v). In all experiments, the effect of solvents and buffers alone was tested.Fig. 2Effect of C8-GlcCer on microsomal Ca2+release.A, cortical microsomes were loaded by two sequential additions of 25 nmol of Ca2+ prior to addition of palmitoyl CoA (30 μm). Ca2+ was also added at the end of each experiment to confirm the functional integrity of the microsomes with respect to Ca2+ uptake. In panels B and C, C8-GlcCer (10 μm) was added before Ca2+, and in panel D, after Ca2+. Ryanodine (350 μm) was added to microsomes before palmitoyl CoA in panel C. Asterisks indicate examples of Ca2+ sparks (see Table II). Data are representative traces showing absorbance change (A710–A790) of antipyrylazo III versus time, with an increase in absorbance demonstrating an increase in free Ca2+ in the cuvette, and a decrease in absorbance demonstrating a decrease in free Ca2+ due to microsomal Ca2+ uptake.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The amount of Ca2+ released from microsomes was expressed as a percent of total Ca2+ in the microsomes, which was obtained by summing Ca2+ taken up during the Ca2+-loading period together with endogenous Ca2+ from the microsomal preparation (measured separately after addition of a Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 (2 μm), without Ca2+ loading). The rate of Ca2+ uptake into microsomes was calculated by measuring the linear portion of the slope after addition of Ca2+, agonist, or lipid. Occasionally, spontaneous quantal Ca2+ release (calcium sparks) was observed. Spontaneous Ca2+ release was considered to be a spark when A710–A790 increased by >0.002 over the baseline, with the baseline defined as the A710–A790 value measured immediately before the spark.[3H]Ryanodine Binding—Rat brain cortical microsomes were resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m KCl, 550 μm ATP, 100 μm CaCl2) to give a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. [3H]Ryanodine-binding was performed as described (33Padua R.A. Wan W.H. Nagy J.I. Geiger J.D. Brain Res. 1991; 542: 135-140Google Scholar) for 1 h at 37 °C, in a final volume of 200 μl of binding buffer containing 50 μl of microsomes and 0.1–30 nm [3H]ryanodine. Nonspecific binding was determined by preincubation with 50 μm ryanodine. The reaction was terminated by addition of 5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m KCl, 100 μm CaCl2), filtration through GF/C glass fiber filters (Whatman) in a Millipore filtration device (Millipore, Bedford, MA), followed by two additional 5-ml washes. The dissociation constant (KD) and the maximum number of receptor sites (Bmax) were derived by Scatchard analysis.GlcCer and GlcSph Analysis—Lipids were extracted (34Bodennec J. Pelled D. Futerman A.H. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 218-226Google Scholar) from the same human temporal lobe microsomes used for Ca2+ analysis. GlcCer and GlcSph were eluted in one fraction by aminopropyl solid phase chromatography using a LC-NH2 cartridge as described (34Bodennec J. Pelled D. Futerman A.H. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 218-226Google Scholar). GSLs and lyso-GSLs were separated by weak cation exchange solid phase extraction using a LC-WCX cartridge, and GSLs subsequently deacylated by alkaline hydrolysis (1 m KOH in methanol, 100 °C, 24 h). The resulting lyso-GSLs were acetylated using 5 mm acetic anhydride containing [3H]acetic anhydride (2 μCi) and NaOH (4 mm) in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), as were the lyso-GSLs obtained in the initial fractionation. A detailed account of this method will appear elsewhere. 2J. Bodennec, S. Trajkovic-Bodennec, and A. H. Futerman, in press. RESULTSCa2+ mobilization from rat brain microsomes was analyzed using the Ca2+-sensitive dye, antipyrylazo III. This dye has been used to measure Ca2+ release from muscle (28Palade P. J. Biol.

Betto R. Salviati G. Sabbadini R. Palade P. Brain Res. 1995; 669: 79-85Google Scholar). By using a rigorous homogenization procedure and by optimizing the recovery of microsomal membranes with respect to Ca2+ uptake, we were able to use this dye to measure Ca2+ release in rat brain microsomes, from which significantly lower levels of RyaRs can be recovered. Upon its addition to the cuvette, Ca2+ accumulated in microsomes and could be released by palmitoyl CoA (Fig. 2A), a RyaR agonist (38Palade P. Dettbarn C. Brunder D. Stein P. Hals G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 295-320Google Scholar, 39Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C530-C537Google Scholar), to a similar extent to that previously reported in canine brain (30Dettbarn C. Betto R. Salviati G. Sabbadini R. Palade P. Brain Res. 1995; 669: 79-85Google Scholar).Palmitoyl CoA-induced Ca2+ release was enhanced upon preincubation with C8-GlcCer (10 μm) by ∼3-fold (Fig. 2B), and could be blocked by preincubation with 350 μm ryanodine (Fig. 2C), a concentration similar to or lower than that used previously to block RyaR-mediated Ca2+ release measured using antipyrylazo III (26Betto R. Teresi A. Turcato F. Salviati G. Sabbadini R.A. Krown K. Glembotski C.C. Kindman L.A. Dettbarn C. Pereon Y. Yasui K. Palade P.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 327-333Google Scholar, 28Palade P. J. Biol.

In contrast, C8-GlcCer did not induce Ca2+ release by itself (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that GlcCer is not an agonist of the RyaR, but rather modulates its activity. LC-GlcCer enhanced Ca2+ release to a similar extent to that of C8-GlcCer, using either palmitoyl CoA or GalSph as RyaR agonists (Table I and Fig. 3). C8-GalCer, over a range of concentrations (Fig. 3), and long-acyl chain GalCer (Table I), were completely ineffective in modulating agonist-induced Ca2+ release, as were a variety of other sphingolipids (Table I), demonstrating a highly specific mode of sensitization of the RyaR by GlcCer.Table IEffect of SLs on microsomal Ca2+releaseSphingolipidAgonistGalSphPalmitoyl CoACa2+ release (percent of total)None18 ± 419 ± 4C8-GlcCer52 ± 361 ± 5C8-GalCer21 ± 316 ± 4C8-LacCer23 ± 316 ± 2C8-Ceramide23 ± 416 ± 1C8-sphingomyelin22 ± 311 ± 4LC-GlcCer61 ± 855 ± 3LC-GalCer17 ± 219 ± 4LC-LacCer23 ± 416 ± 4 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Concentration dependence of C8-GlcCer-enhanced agonist-induced Ca2+release.

In untreated microsomes, ∼2 sparks per hour were observed over the time-course of a typical experiment, which increased to ∼6 sparks per hour in the presence of C8-GlcCer, both of which could be completely blocked by ryanodine (Table II). The amount of Ca2+ released per spark was higher in the presence of C8- and LC-GlcCer than in controls, although it was not statistically significant (Table II). Likewise, LC-GlcCer caused a significant increase in spark frequency, but no increase was observed with other GSLs. These data strengthen the idea that GlcCer sensitizes the RyaR.Table IIEffect of GSLs on spontaneous RyaR-mediated Ca2+releaseNumber of Ca2+ sparks per minCa2+ release per sparknmolNo addition0.028 ± 0.0072.34 ± 0.23Ethanol0.024 ± 0.0111.90 ± 0.59Ethanol/dodecane0.052 ± 0.0201.36 ± 0.06C8-GlcCer0.104 ± 0.019*3.17 ± 0.40Ryanodine + C8-GlcCer0.006 ± 0.0061.42aOnly one spark was observed.DTT + C8-GlcCer0.015 ± 0.0151.28aOnly one spark was observed.LC-GlcCer0.115 ± 0.033*3.13 ± 0.39C8-GalCer0.054 ± 0.0232.02 ± 0.63LC-GalCer0.034 ± 0.0131.52 ± 0.21C8-LacCer0.033 ± 0.0311.94 ± 0.36LC-LacCer0.023 ± 0.0081.84 ± 0.38a Only one spark was observed. Open table in a new tab We next examined the ability of GlcCer to mobilize Ca2+ via other mechanisms. C8-GlcCer did not affect InsP3-induced Ca2+ release from cerebellar microsomes, a rich source of the InsP3R (43Mikoshiba K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 339-345Google Scholar), which could be blocked by the InsP3R antagonist, heparin (44Ghosh T.K. Bian J.H. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22628-22635Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Neither C8-GlcCer, C8-GalCer (Fig. 4B), nor 10 μm LC-GlcCer (0.45 ± 0.08 nmol/sec/mg of protein) or 10 μm LC-GalCer (0.39 ± 0.05 nmol/sec/mg of protein) had an effect on the rate of Ca2+ influx into microsomes via the Ca2+-ATPase, SERCA. Thus, we conclude that GlcCer specifically modulates Ca2+ mobilization via the RyaR and not via the InsP3R or SERCA. Since neither pretreatment with C8-GlcCer, LC-GlcCer, or LC-GalCer had any effect on the Bmax or KD of [3H]ryanodine binding to the RyaR (Bmax of [3H]ryanodine binding (fmol/mg of protein) for control (ethanol or ethanol/dodecane-treated) microsomes = 341 ± 9, Bmax for C8-GlcCer = 350 ± 46, Bmax for LC-GlcCer = 291 ± 15, and Bmax for LC-GalCer = 335 ± 16; KD (nm) for control = 1.7 ± 0.1, KD for C8-GlcCer = 1.8 ± 0.7, KD for LC-GlcCer = 1.4 ± 0.1, KD for LC-GalCer = 1.7 ± 0.2), we further conclude that GlcCer does not affect the affinity, and hence the efficacy of ryanodine binding to the RyaR.Fig. 4Effect of C8-GlcCer on InsP3Rs and on SERCA.A, cerebellar microsomes were incubated with C8-GlcCer (10 μm) prior to induction of Ca2+ release using InsP3 (25 μm), with or without preincubation with heparin (150 μg/ml).

B, cortical microsomes were incubated with C8-GlcCer (closed squares) or C8-GalCer (open squares) prior to Ca2+ addition, and the rate of microsomal Ca2+ uptake analyzed spectrophotometrically.

Preincubation with the reducing agent, DTT, completely abolished the ability of C8-GlcCer (Fig. 5) to enhance agonist-induced Ca2+ release, and blocked calcium sparks (Table II), suggesting that GlcCer may modulate the redox state of the RyaR via its redox sensor (48Baker M.L.

Previous studies have suggested that GlcCer accumulates in Gaucher brain tissue (50Nilsson O. Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1982; 39: 709-718Google Scholar, 51Nilsson O. Grabowski G.A. Ludman M.D. Desnick R.J. Svennerholm L. Clin. Genet. 1985; 27: 443-450Google Scholar), but the extent of accumulation was highly variable, ranging from 5–80-fold compared with normal brains. Using a new method for separation of GSLs and lyso-GSLs (34Bodennec J. Pelled D. Futerman A.H. J.

Intriguingly, palmitoyl CoA-induced Ca2+ release from Gaucher brain microsomes was significantly higher than from human control brain microsomes, and could be reduced by DTT to control levels (Fig. 6). Thus, these data demonstrate a physiological and pathophysiological link between GlcCer accumulation in Gaucher brains and enhanced levels of Ca2+ release via the RyaR.Table IIIGlcCer and GlcSph levels in human brain microsomesControl brainGaucher type 2 brainnmol/mg of proteinGlcCer2.0927.95GlcSphNDaND, not detected, i.e. <0.01 nmol/mg of protein (see Footnote 2).4.88a ND, not detected, i.e. <0.01 nmol/mg of protein (see Footnote 2).

We have examined the interaction between flagellin and TLR5 using an in vitro binding assay. Purified recombinant His-tagged flagellin from Salmonella enteritidis bound to TLR5 in detergent lysates from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with a human TLR5 expression plasmid. Flagellins from Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli also bound to TLR5. The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by its concentration dependence and lack of TLR5 binding to a biologically inactive form of flagellin or to a His-tagged non-flagellar protein. Flagellin bound to the extracellular domain of TLR5 expressed on the surface of COS-1 cells and to a soluble, monomeric form of the extracellular domain (amino acids 1–636). Although a TLR5 extracellular domain containing amino acids 1–407 retained flagellin binding activity, binding was not evident with a TLR5 peptide encoding residues 1–386. Conversely, a peptide containing amino acid residues 386–636 retained flagellin binding. Thus it is likely that amino acids 386–407 is a binding site for flagellin. This sequence contains a putative leucine-rich repeat. These results support the conclusion that flagellin signaling via TLR5 involves a direct interaction between flagellin and a leucine-rich region in TLR5. We also show that the NH2-terminal 358 amino acids of TLR5 play an important role in its signaling activity. Our results provide, for the first time, a molecular basis for the agonist specificity of a TLR.

Activation of the innate immune response by bacteria is mediated by a group of molecules that have collectively been termed modulins (1Henderson B. Poole S. Wilson M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 316-341Google Scholar). This family of molecules includes a wide variety of substances including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, toll-like receptor; TLR5-ED, TLR5-extracellular domain; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, toll-like receptor; TLR5-ED, TLR5-extracellular domain; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; HA, hemagglutinin. from Gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria, several different viral envelope glycoproteins, and flagellins from Gram-negative bacteria. Monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells respond to modulins by producing proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, and nitric oxide. Many bacterial modulins signal via toll-like receptors (TLR), a family of cell surface molecules that possess a leucine-rich extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology domain (2Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Google Scholar).

Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 276: 21129-21135Google Scholar). Difference in LPS structure may influence the quality of these interactions (12Hajjar A.M. Ernst R.K. Tsai J.H. Wilson C.B. Miller S.I. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 354-359Google Scholar). Although the region of TLR4 that is involved in the recognition of LPS has not been defined, the structural features of CD14 that are involved in the recognition of LPS have been well characterized (13Shapiro R.A.

Tanamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42372-42379Google Scholar). In a recent study, it was suggested that peptidoglycan from Staphylococcus aureus can bind directly to the extracellular domain of TLR2 (17Iwaki D. Hiroaki M. Murakami S. Sano H. Konishi M. Akino T. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24315-24320Google Scholar). However, soluble CD14 was found to enhance this interaction, leaving open the possibility that CD14 or similar proteins might be mediators of the interaction between peptidoglycan and TLR2. Recent reports from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that flagellins from Gram-negative bacteria activate a range of inflammatory cells via a TLR5-dependent signaling pathway (18Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Google Scholar, 19Gewirtz A.T. Navas T.A. Lyons S. Godowski P.J.

As with other TLRs, flagellin signaling via TLR5 involves the activation of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (20Mizel S.B. Snipes J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22414-22420Google Scholar, 21Moors M.A. Li L. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4424-4429Google Scholar). Although the TLR5 dependence of Gram-negative flagellin signaling has been well documented, the structural requirements for the interaction between flagellin and TLR5 are only partially understood. Structure/function studies with soluble flagellin indicate that the amino and carboxyl constant regions are most critical for TLR5 signaling (22Donnelly M.A. Steiner T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40456-40461Google Scholar, 23Eaves-Pyles T. Wong H.R. Odoms K. Pyles R.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 167: 7009-7016Google Scholar). We have shown that flagellin is active at concentrations in the picomolar to nanomolar range (24McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Google Scholar), a finding that is consistent with a very high affinity interaction. However, it was not known if flagellin binds directly to TLR5 or initially interacts with a co-receptor that acts in a manner similar to CD14. We recently developed a robust TLR5 expression system using transiently transfected COS-1 cells to elucidate the mechanism for flagellin-induced self-tolerance (20Mizel S.B. Snipes J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22414-22420Google Scholar). Because we have found it difficult to express full-length TLR5 or the extracellular domain of TLR5 in bacteria or yeast, 2J. Sun and S. B. Mizel, unpublished observations. 2J. Sun and S. B. Mizel, unpublished observations. we have used the COS-1 expression system to determine whether purified flagellin can bind directly to TLR5 and if so, to define the region of TLR5 required for binding. Cells and Reagents—COS-1 cells and RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco' s modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin. Purified, endotoxin-free recombinant His-tagged Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, and E. coli flagellins were prepared as previously described (24McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Google Scholar). In the case of S. typhimurium, we prepared the two types of flagellin, FliC and FljB, that are produced by this strain of bacteria. We also prepared a mutant S. enteritidis flagellin 229 that lacks biological activity (24McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Google Scholar). Recombinant His-tagged AlgB from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25Ma S. Selvaraj U. Ohman D.E. Quarless R. Hassett D.J. Wozniak D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 956-968Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Wozniak (Wake Forest University School of Medicine). Anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma and high affinity anti-HA antibody from Roche Diagnostics. Plasmids—The p3XFLAG-CMV-14-TLR5 (20Mizel S.B. Snipes J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22414-22420Google Scholar) contains a full-length cDNA encoding human TLR5-FLAG. The HA-tagged human TLR5 expression plasmid was prepared by cloning an amplified TLR5 PCR product into the pMH vector (Roche Diagnostics). A cDNA encoding the signal sequence and extracellular domain of TLR5-ED-(1–636) was generated by PCR using the forward primer, 5′-gccattcccaagcttccgccaatgggagaccacctggacctt-3′ and the reverse primer, 5′-gctcgatgcggatccctttaagacttcctcttcatc-3′. The resultant product was directionally cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV-14 at the HindIII and BamHI sites. The truncated forms of the extracellular domain of TLR5 were also generated by PCR and were cloned into the p3XFLAG-CMV vector. All products were sequenced to ensure that mutations were not introduced during the PCR. Although a signal sequence is encoded in the first 28 amino acids of TLR5-(26Chaudhary P.M. Ferguson C.

Genomics. 2000; 64: 230-240Google Scholar), we have referred to each peptide on the basis of the unprocessed polypeptide (e.g. 1–636). Mutations were introduced into the TLR5 sequence using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The presence of mutations was confirmed by sequence analysis. The p3XFLAG-myc-CMV-23 expression vector was obtained from Sigma. Proteins expressed with this vector contain an NH2-terminal preprotrypsin signal sequence followed by a 3× FLAG tag and a COOH-terminal Myc tag. Binding of Flagellin to TLR5 in Cell Lysates—COS-1 cells (2 × 106) were transiently transfected with TLR5 expression plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) and rested for 48 h prior to use. The binding of flagellin to TLR5 in detergent cell lysates was done in the following manner. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.4% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors (20Mizel S.B. Snipes J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22414-22420Google Scholar) and then the lysates were centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 3 min in a refrigerated centrifuge to remove insoluble material. The supernatants were incubated on a rotator in the presence or absence of the indicated concentration of His-tagged flagellin or AlgB and 25 μl of Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) for2hat4 °C. The samples were centrifuged to remove unbound material and then the Talon beads were washed 3 times with immunoprecipitation buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm imidazole. The samples were then boiled for 5 min in gel sample buffer and electrophoresed in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (100 V, 1 h). Western blot analysis was done as described previously (20Mizel S.B. Snipes J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22414-22420Google Scholar) using anti-FLAG or HA antibodies. Flagellin Binding to Cell Surface-associated TLR5—To assess the binding of flagellin to intact cells, the cultures of transfected COS-1 cells were placed on ice in ice-cold medium in the presence or absence of 4.8 × 10–8mS. enteritidis flagellin for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound flagellin was removed by repeated washing of the cell monolayers with ice-cold medium. Cell lysates were prepared as described above and incubated with the Talon metal affinity resin without additional flagellin. Sedimentation Velocity Measurements of TLR5-ED—Samples were characterized by sucrose density gradient sedimentation as described (29Hantgan R.R. Stahle M. Del Gaizo V. Adams M. Lasher T. Jerome W.G. McKenzie M. Lyles D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 82-95Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with TLR5-ED-(1–636) or TLR5-ED-(1–425) and lysates were prepared. A 200-μl aliquot of each lysate was layered over a 5-ml 5–20% sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 5 h at 50,000 rpm (20 °C). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and analyzed for the presence of TLR5 by Western blotting. The positions of samples within the gradient were converted to sedimentation coefficients based on the profiles of samples of known s20,w value (29Hantgan R.R. Stahle M. Del Gaizo V. Adams M. Lasher T. Jerome W.G. McKenzie M. Lyles D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 82-95Google Scholar). Inducible Nitric-oxide Synthase Promoter Activation in RAW 264.7 Cells—RAW 264.7 cells are TLR5-negative, but respond to flagellin when transiently transfected with a TLR5 expression plasmid (41Mizel S.B. Honko A.N. Moors M.A. Smith P.S. West A.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 170 (in press)Google Scholar). To assess the biological activity of truncated forms of TLR5, RAW 264.7 cells were transiently co-transfected with an expression plasmid encoding full-length human or truncated forms spanning either amino acid residues 386–857 or 426–857, a flagellin-responsive inducible nitric-oxide synthase promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid, and pRL-TK/luciferase (to control for transfection efficiency), rested overnight, and then stimulated for 6 h with 10–10m flagellin. Inducible nitric-oxide synthase promoter-dependent and constitutive Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Promega dualluciferase assay system. Flagellin Binds in a Specific Manner to TLR5 in Detergent Lysates from COS-1 Cells—Detergent lysates were prepared from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with an expression plasmid encoding human TLR5-HA and incubated in the presence or absence of either 4.8 × 10–8m His-tagged flagellin or His-tagged AlgB and Talon metal affinity resin (Fig. 1a). TLR5-HA associated with the Talon resin, but only in the presence of flagellin. Incubation in the absence of flagellin or with the negative control AlgB resulted in background levels of TLR5 association. These results are consistent with a specific interaction between flagellin and TLR5. The extent of complex formation was dependent on the concentration of flagellin. Binding was detected with as low as 8.5 × 10–10m flagellin (Fig. 1b, lane 2) and was maximal at concentrations above 3.4 × 10–9m (lane 4). These concentrations of flagellin are in the range of those required for biological activity (20Mizel S.B. Snipes J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22414-22420Google Scholar, 21Moors M.A. Li L. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4424-4429Google Scholar, 24McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Google Scholar). To obtain additional evidence demonstrating the specificity of the flagellin/TLR5 interaction, we tested the ability of flagellins from S. typhimurium and E. coli as well as a S. enteritidits flagellin mutant 229 that is biologically inactive (24McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Google Scholar). In the case of S. typhimurium, we tested FliC and FljB, the phase variable forms of flagellin produced by this organism. The two proteins possess equal biological activity. To ensure that flagellin was binding to TLR5 and not the HA tag, we used an expression plasmid encoding TLR5-FLAG. As shown in Fig. 1c, the S. typhimurium and E. coli proteins were all able to bind TLR5. However, the 229 mutant exhibited little if any ability to bind TLR5. Thus these results provide additional support for the specificity of flagellin binding to TLR5. Flagellin Binds to the Extracellular Domain of TLR5—Having established the ability of flagellin to bind to TLR5 in cell lysates, we next determined if flagellin bound to TLR5 was expressed on the surface of cells. Transfected COS-1 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 4.8 × 10–8m flagellin for 30 min on ice and then washed to remove unbound flagellin. Detergent lysates were then prepared and incubated with the Talon metal affinity resin. As shown in Fig. 1d, flagellin bound to TLR5 expressed on the surface of cells, a finding that is consistent with an interaction involving the extracellular domain of TLR5. Flagellin Binds to a Soluble Form of the Extracellular Domain of TLR5—As a first step in defining a binding site for flagellin, we evaluated the ability of flagellin to bind to a soluble form of the extracellular domain of TLR5. A cDNA encoding the first 636 amino acids of TLR5 was generated and inserted into the p3XFLAG-CMV-14 expression vector. The expressed protein contains a signal sequence, the extracellular domain of TLR5, and a FLAG tag at the COOH terminus. We have termed the expressed protein, TLR5-ED-(1–636). As shown in Fig. 2a, COS-1 cells not only expressed TLR5-ED-(1–636), but secreted the protein as well (lane 4). Because the cell-associated and secreted forms of the protein exhibit the same apparent molecular mass in SDS gels, we assume that the signal peptide of the cell-associated form is fully processed and the protein was in transit through the secretory pathway. Incubation of TLR5-ED-(1–636)-containing lysates with flagellin and the Talon resin resulted in the association of the protein with the resin (Fig. 2a, lane 2). Association was not observed in the absence of flagellin (lane 1) or in the presence of the 229 flagellin mutant (lane 3). These results not only confirm the ability of flagellin to bind to the extracellular domain of TLR5, but demonstrate a relationship between binding to TLR5 and biological activity (24McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Google Scholar, 30Ciacci-Woolwine F. Blomfield I.C. Richardson S.H. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1127-1134Google Scholar). Determination of the Minimal Form of TLR5-ED Required for Flagellin Binding—Having established the ability of TLR5-ED-(1–636) to bind to flagellin, we initiated experiments to determine the region of the TLR5 extracellular domain that was required for binding. TLR5-ED-(1–478) and TLR5-ED-(1–425), like TLR5-ED-(1–636), bound to flagellin (Fig. 2b). TLR5-ED-(1–425) reproducibly exhibited greater binding activity than the full-length extracellular domain. In contrast, TLR5-ED-(1–372), TLR5-ED-(1–319), and TLR5-ED-(1–159) did not bind to flagellin. It is important to emphasize that all of the proteins were expressed at comparable levels (data not shown). To more precisely determine the minimal polypeptide that retains flagellin binding, we generated a series of truncations between residue 425 and 372 and tested them in the flagellin binding assay. TLR5-ED-(1–407) retained binding activity, but TLR5-ED-(1–386) did not possess detectable activity (Fig. 2c). The activity of the TLR5-ED-(1–407) was reduced relative to the TLR5-ED-(1–425) (Fig. 2c), but was similar to the activity of the full-length extracellular domain, TLR5-ED-(1–636) (Fig. 2b). Based on these results, we hypothesized that the region between amino acid residues 386 and 407 is involved in the binding of flagellin, either by serving as a binding site or by facilitating the folding of the polypeptide in the proper form for flagellin binding. Having established the importance of the region between residues 386 and 407 of TLR-ED in truncations containing the NH2 terminus of the TLR5 extracellular domain, we tested the converse construct from amino acids 386 to the COOH terminus of the extracellular domain (TLR5-ED-(386–636). As shown in Fig. 2d, TLR5-ED-(386–636), like TLR5-ED-(1–407), possesses the ability to bind flagellin. The fact that the same sequence (386–407) confers binding activity to the NH2 and COOH terminus regions of the extracellular domain of TLR5 supports the idea that the 386–407 region functions as a binding site for flagellin rather than conferring the proper conformation for flagellin binding at some other site. This conclusion is strengthened by the observations that residues 408–636 are not required for flagellin binding by the NH2 terminus TLR5-ED and that residues 1–385 are not required for flagellin binding by the COOH terminus TLR5-ED (Fig. 2). Sedimentation Velocity Centrifugation of TLR5-ED—We have found that full-length TLR5 self-associates (41Mizel S.B. Honko A.N. Moors M.A. Smith P.S. West A.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 170 (in press)Google Scholar). We analyzed the sedimentation velocity of TLR5-ED-(1–636) and TLR5-ED-(1–425) to determine whether these TLR5 extracellular domain forms self-associate or associate with other proteins in the COS-1 cell lysates. We prepared COS-1 cell lysates containing either TLR5-ED-(1–636) or TLR5-ED-(1–425) and used rate zonal centrifugation to determine the sedimentation coefficients for each polypeptide by comparison with standards of known s20,w. As shown in Fig. 3, both polypeptides exhibited experimental s20,w values that were consistent with monomeric forms (6.4 S for TLR5-ED-(1–636) and 4.9 S for TLR5-ED-(1–425)). Thus it is unlikely that the difference between the two polypeptides in terms of flagellin binding is because of differences in their state of self-association. In addition, because the s20,w values are consistent with the presence of monomers, these results support the conclusion that flagellin binds directly to monomeric forms of TLR5-ED and not to an associated protein. However, it is possible that TLR5-ED complexes might form, but are unstable under conditions used in these experiments or that a small subset of complexes containing multimers of TLR-ED and possibly one or more other proteins are responsible for the observed binding of flagellin. The TLR5-ED Region Encompassing Amino Acids 1–386 Is Required for Signaling—Because the region encompassing amino acids 386–407 is involved in flagellin binding, we considered the possibility that a TLR5 beginning at residue 386 and including transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains might be sufficient for flagellin signaling. Therefore, we prepared cDNAs encoding residues 386–857 and tested its ability to signal in RAW 264.7 cells, a cell line lacking endogenous TLR5, but responds to flagellin when transiently transfected with a TLR5 expression plasmid (41Mizel S.B. Honko A.N. Moors M.A. Smith P.S. West A.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 170 (in press)Google Scholar). Inducible nitric-oxide synthase promoter-dependent luciferase expression was used as a measure of flagellin signaling in the transiently transfected RAW 264.7 cells. Even though the truncated TLR5 contains a flagellin binding site, it did not transmit a signal in the RAW 264.7 cells (Table I).Table ITLR5-(386-857) does not signal in RAW 264.7 cellsTLR5 expression plasmidLuciferase activityRLUaRAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated TLR5 expression plasmid as well as an iNOS/luciferase reporter plasmid and a thymidine kinase/Renilla luciferase plasmid (to control for transfection efficiency).

The cells were incubated in the presence or absence of flagellin for 6 h and the inducible and Renilla luciferase activities were measured. The values shown have been corrected for background luciferase activity in unstimulated cells. Open table in a new tab Because the truncated TLR5 did not signal, we considered the possibility that the lack of activity was because of a diminished ability of the mutant to self-associate. To evaluate this possibility, COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with TLR5-HA and TLR5-FLAG or the truncated form of TLR5-FLAG containing amino acid residues 386–857, and the presence of multimers was assessed following immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4, the full-length form of TLR5-FLAG associates with TLR5-HA. The truncated form of TLR5-FLAG did not appear to be markedly different from full-length TLR5 in its ability to associate with full-length TLR5. Combined with the results presented in Fig. 3, we conclude that the self-association of TLR5 requires the COOH terminus including the transmembrane domain, but signaling also requires regions within the first 385 NH2-terminal amino acids. Using a COS-1 cell expression system for producing various forms of TLR5, we have shown that flagellin binds in a highly specific manner to the extracellular domain of TLR5. The relationship between the specificity of binding and bioactivity is evidenced by the inability of a biologically inactive form of flagellin to bind TLR5. Using truncated forms of the TLR5 extracellular domain, we have mapped a region (residues 386–407) that is critical for flagellin binding. Although it is formally possible that the requirement for this region is because of its role in the folding of the extracellular domain of TLR5, we favor the hypothesis that this region contains the binding site for flagellin. The ability of TLR5-ED-(1–407) and TLR5-ED-(386–636) to bind flagellin represents the strongest evidence for this conclusion (Fig. 2d). The observation that TLR5-ED-(1–425) binds flagellin better than TLR5-ED-(1–636) or -(1–407) indicates that the region encompassing residues 408–425 plays an accessory role in flagellin binding. It is possible that this region promotes the proper folding of the 386–407 domain or alternatively contributes directly to the quality of the overall binding to flagellin. Because the TLR5-ED exists as a monomer, it is quite likely that flagellin binds directly to TLR5 and does not require a co-receptor. The observed concentration dependence for flagellin binding is consistent with this conclusion. Although the presence of amino acids 386–407 permits binding to flagellin, signaling is clearly dependent on one or more regions between residues 28 and 386. The absence of this region is associated with a loss of signaling ability (Table I). Because the ability of the truncated TLR5 to oligomerize is not dramatically reduced, we hypothesize that the NH2-terminal domain of the protein plays a role in signaling subsequent to the binding of flagellin. Although our results support the conclusion that flagellin has a high affinity for TLR5, additional studies are clearly required to determine the affinity constant for binding. Our efforts to achieve this goal have been hampered by problems associated with conventional whole cell binding assays and large scale production of TLR5 for in vitro binding assays. In preliminary studies, we observed that flagellin non-specifically interacts with lipid bilayers making it very difficult to assess specific binding to cell-associated TLR5. Furthermore, yeast and bacterial protein expression systems have not been productive sources of full-length TLR5 or its extracellular domain. This contrasts with our ability to obtain expression of the intracellular domain of TLR5.2 Nonetheless, we believe that the results presented in this study represent a major step forward in our understanding of the interaction of flagellin with TLR5 as well as the selectivity of TLR5 for flagellin. Analysis of the 386–407 region of TLR5 revealed that this sequence matches the consensus sequence for a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) (Fig. 5) (31Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Google Scholar). The known LRR-containing proteins share two fundamental properties, namely, the presence of repetitive LRR sequences and involvement in protein-protein interactions (31Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Google Scholar). These LRRs consist of a short β-strand and an α-helix that are parallel to each other and separated by a loop. Although TLRs possess LRRs, the specific function(s) of this motif has not previously been established. On the basis of our findings, we propose that the role of this LRR in TLR5 is to serve as a specific binding site for flagellin. Our findings regarding the structural features of TLR5 required for flagellin binding may provide important clues as to the nature of the interaction of these two proteins. The results of two recent studies (22Donnelly M.A. Steiner T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40456-40461Google Scholar, 23Eaves-Pyles T. Wong H.R. Odoms K. Pyles R.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 167: 7009-7016Google Scholar) indicate that the conserved amino and carboxyl regions of flagellin are required for biologic activity. This appears to be in conflict with our observation (24McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Google Scholar) that a peptide containing only these two regions was inactive. However, as noted by Eaves-Pyles et al. (23Eaves-Pyles T. Wong H.R. Odoms K. Pyles R.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 167: 7009-7016Google Scholar), such a peptide may not function because it lacks a bridge that facilitates the necessary interaction between the two ends of the flagellin protein. The involvement of the highly conserved termini of flagellin in TLR5 binding is consistent with the notion that a key feature of pathogen-associated molecular patterns is their invariance between microorganisms of a given class (32Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Google Scholar). The NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of flagellin possess heptad repeats of hydrophobic amino acid residues (33Homma M. DeRosier D.J. Macnab R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 819-832Google Scholar). It is possible that these sequences play a critical role in the interaction of flagellin and TLR5. For example, Marino et al. (34Marino M. Braun L. Cossart P. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1063-1072Google Scholar) have suggested that hydrophobic sequences within a LRR in InIB, a protein involved in Listeria monocytogenes invasion of phagocytes, may play an important role in the interaction of this protein with its cellular receptor. In the monomeric form, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of flagellin exist in a relatively disordered form (35Kostyukova A. Pyatibratov M.G. Filimonov V.V. Fedorov O.V.

However, upon polymerization, the termini become α-helical and forms an interlocking pattern of coiled-coil bundles (37Vonderviszt F. Sonoyama M. Tasumi M. Namba K. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1672-1677Google Scholar, 38Gugolya Z. Muskotál A. Sebestyén A. Diószeghy Z. Vonderviszt F.

The flagellin that is constitutively released by Gram-negative bacteria exists as predominantly dimers and trimers (40Ciacci-Woolwine F. Kucera L.S. Richardson S.H. Iyer N.P. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4624-4633Google Scholar). This is also the case with the purified, recombinant flagellin used in our studies. Thus it is likely that the amino and carboxyl termini of biologically active soluble flagellin have assumed the formation associated with the polymerized form of the protein. Although TLR5-ED-(1–636) and -(1–425) exist predominantly as monomers (Fig. 3), full-length TLR5 forms multimers (Fig. 4 and Ref. 41Mizel S.B. Honko A.N. Moors M.A. Smith P.S. West A.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 170 (in press)Google Scholar). Because flagellin exists in large part as dimers and trimers (40Ciacci-Woolwine F. Kucera L.S. Richardson S.H. Iyer N.P. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4624-4633Google Scholar), it is possible that a single flagellin multimer may bind to more than one TLR5 oligomer. The ability to cross-link TLR5 complexes may provide an additional mechanism for the extraordinary potency of flagellin. In view of our findings, we hypothesize that specific LRRs in other TLRs function as binding sites for specific ligands. If subsequent studies support this notion, then it should be possible to develop a family of antagonists that block TLR agonists. Such molecules might be of substantial benefit in the prevention of septic shock. In addition, it should be possible to develop small molecules that recognize the LRR binding motif in specific TLRs and trigger TLR signaling. Such agonists would be of great benefit in those instances in which enhanced innate immunity is needed, as for example, in promoting anti-microbial immunity or increasing the efficacy of vaccination.

https://openalex.org/W2029311197,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR) signaling both play important roles in inflammatory and immune responses through activation of NF-κB. Using various deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, we have compared the signaling pathways leading to NF-κB induction in response to TNF-α and LTβR activation. We demonstrate that LTβR ligation induces not only RelA/p50 dimers but also RelB/p50 dimers, whereas TNF-α induces only RelA/p50 dimers. LTβR-induced binding of RelB/p50 requires processing of p100 that is mediated by IKKα but is independent of IKKβ, NEMO/IKKγ, and RelA. Moreover, we show that RelB, p50, and p100 can associate in the same complex and that TNF-α but not LTβ signaling increases the association of p100 with RelB/p50 dimers in the nucleus, leading to the specific inhibition of RelB DNA binding. These results suggest that the alternative NF-κB pathway based on p100 processing may account not only for the activation of RelB/p52 dimers but also for that of RelB/p50 dimers and that p100 regulates the binding activity of RelB/p50 dimers via at least two distinct mechanisms depending on the signaling pathway involved.

NF-κB transcription factors are key regulators of transcription of a variety of genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses and in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Barnes P.J.

In mammalian cells, the NF-κB family is composed of five members, RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel (Rel), NF-κB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), and exists as a heterogeneous collection of homodimers and heterodimers (3Ghosh S.

In resting cells, NF-κB activity is tightly controlled by IκB family members, which include IκBα, IκBβ, IκBϵ, Bcl-3, p100, and p105 (9Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). The IKK complex is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (also known as NEMO) (11Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). The disruption of genes encoding individual subunits have demonstrated that IKKβ and IKKγ are required for mediating the canonical NF-κB activity (i.e. RelA/p50 dimers) induced by inflammatory signals (12Li Z.W.

RelB is the only NF-κB member that cannot homodimerize and only triggers potent transcriptional activation when coupled to p50 or p52 (22Bours V. Azarenko V. Dejardin E. Siebenlist U.

Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1572-1582Google Scholar). Analyses of RelB-deficient mice have shown that RelB is essential to the development of medullary epithelium, mature dendritic cell function, and secondary lymphoid tissue organization (26Wu L. D'Amico A. Winkel K.D. Suter M. Lo D. Shortman K. Immunity. 1998; 9: 839-847Google Scholar, 27Weih F. Carrasco D. Durham S.K. Barton D.S. Rizzo C.A. Ryseck R.P. Lira S.A. Bravo R.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 1909-1919Google Scholar). Relb–/– mice also spontaneously develop a generalized persistent non-infectious multi-organ inflammatory syndrome (30Weih F. Durham S.K. Barton D.S. Sha W.C. Baltimore D. Bravo R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3974-3979Google Scholar). Until recently, the canonical NF-κB (RelA/p50) was considered to be the predominant inducible κB DNA binding activity in most cell types in response to a broad range of stimuli, whereas RelB represented the major constitutive κB activity in lymphoid cells (31Weih F. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3289-3297Google Scholar, 32Dobrzanski P. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4608-4616Google Scholar). However, in the past few months, an alternative mechanism for inducing NF-κB activity has emerged based on the observation that inducible IKKα-dependent p100 processing allows the resultant p52 to function as transcriptional activator (20Claudio E. Brown K. Park S. Wang H. Siebenlist U. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 958-965Google Scholar, 21Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R.

Immunity. 2002; 17: 515-524Google Scholar). Remarkably, a pathway-dependent specificity in p52 binding partner was demonstrated. Whereas RelA/p52 dimers are the targets of the canonical pathway, nuclear translocation of RelB/p52 is regulated via the alternative NF-κB pathway and leads to the transcription of a specific pool of genes (21Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Google Scholar). Most importantly, all of these studies point to a crucial role for the alternative NF-κB pathway in controlling the development, organization, and function of lymphoid tissue. The participation of RelB in non-lymphoid function is much less well documented. Although RelB was initially identified as an immediate-early gene in fibroblasts (24Ryseck R.P. Bull P. Takamiya M. Bours V. Siebenlist U. Dobrzanski P. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 674-684Google Scholar), it has now been shown to play an essential role in limiting the expression of proinflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide-induced fibroblasts (35Xia Y. Pauza M.E. Feng L. Lo D. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 375-387Google Scholar, 36Xia Y. Chen S. Wang Y. Mackman N. Ku G. Lo D. Feng L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7688-7696Google Scholar), thereby playing an important role in the resolution of acute inflammation. Interestingly, in the non-lymphoid cells examined so far (e.g. NIH 3T3, smooth muscle cells), RelB was found mainly in association with p50 but not p52 in the inducible κB DNA binding complexes (24Ryseck R.P. Bull P. Takamiya M. Bours V. Siebenlist U. Dobrzanski P. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 674-684Google Scholar, 37Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V.

In contrast to recent progress in understanding the regulation of RelB/p52 dimers, the mechanisms controlling the inducible RelB/p50 DNA binding activity are still poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the regulation of RelB/p50 dimers in fibroblasts in response to ligation of TNFR and LTβR, two members of the TNFR superfamily involved in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses (39Tracey K.J.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 107-119Google Scholar). We demonstrate that RelB/p50 activation triggered by LTβR ligation requires processing of p100 that is mediated through IKKα but not IKKβ, IKKγ, or RelA. Moreover, we show that RelB, p50, and p100 can associate in the same complex and that TNF-α signaling leads to the inhibition of RelB DNA binding via an increased association of p100 with RelB/p50 dimers in the nucleus. Reagents and Antibodies—Murine recombinant TNF-α was purchased from Sigma, and agonistic anti-LTβR mAb AC.H6 was a kind gift from J. Browning. J. Hiscott and N. Rice generously provided anti-p52/p100 and anti-p50/p105 polyclonal antibodies. The remaining antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (IKKα, RelA, RelB, p105/p50, cRel, and phospholipase Cγ-1), Upstate Biotechnology (IKKβ, p100/p52, and p105/p50), and BD Biosciences (IKKγ). Cell Culture and Cell Lines—IKKα-, IKKβ-, NEMO/IKKγ-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were described previously (12Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Google Scholar, 14Schmidt-Supprian M. Bloch W. Courtois G. Addicks K. Israel A. Rajewsky K. Pasparakis M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 981-992Google Scholar, 16Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Google Scholar). RelA-, RelB-, and NF-κB2-deficient MEFs were a kind gift from A. Beg, F. Weih, and J. Caamano, respectively. MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptavidin. HT29 (ATCC) were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium with the same supplements. Cell Extract Preparation—Whole cell extracts were prepared as reported previously (44Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Google Scholar). For cytosolic and nuclear proteins, cells were lysed for 5 min on ice in hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cytosolic fraction was harvested after centrifuging the lysate for 5 min at 4500 × g. The nuclear pellet was washed once with hypotonic buffer and lysed for 30 min on ice in extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Anti-phospholipase C-γ was used as control for cytoplasmic contamination in nuclear fractions. Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, 500 μg of nuclear or whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C using specific antibodies, after which protein A/G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and incubation continued for 90 min at 4 °C. After four washes in lysis buffer, the beads were heat-denatured to release the proteins. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Immunoblotting was performed with specific antibodies and visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). For double immunoprecipitation, nuclear or whole cell extracts were incubated with anti-p50 antibody and protein A/G-agarose beads. After five washes in lysis buffer, the antigen-antibody complexes were eluted with a 15-fold excess (w/w) of the specific peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-RelB antibody and protein A/G-agarose beads. The immune complexes obtained were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by immunoblotting with anti-p100 antibody. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed as previously described using the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat tandem κB oligonucleotide as κB probe (45Feuillard J. Gouy H. Bismuth G. Lee L.M. Debre P. Korner M. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 257-265Google Scholar). For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with specific antibodies for 30 min on ice before incubation with the labeled probe. RT-PCR—RT-PCR were performed as described previously (46Baud V. Chissoe S.L. Viegas-Pequignot E. Diriong S. N′Guyen V.C. Roe B.A. Lipinski M. Genomics. 1995; 26: 334-344Google Scholar). Linear response ranges were determined for each gene to semiquantify their expression levels. Primer sequences are available upon request. Ligation of LTβR but Not TNFR Activates RelB/p50 DNA Binding—We used EMSA to evaluate the nuclear NF-κB DNA binding activity induced by ligation of LTβR and TNFR. As shown in Fig. 1A, whereas nuclear extracts from untreated WT MEFs contained only low levels of NF-κB DNA binding activity, treatment with either TNF-α or agonistic anti-LTβR mAb AC.H6 both resulted in two phases of NF-κB activation. TNF-α-induced NF-κB binding activity was detected after 30 min of treatment (complex I), decreased to basal levels after 60 min, returned to near maximal levels after 4 h of treatment, and persisted for at least 8 h. Complex I was also induced after 30 min of treatment with anti-LTβR antibody, but a faster migrating κB complex (complex II) was detected after 4–8 h of treatment. The subunit composition of the NF-κB DNA binding complexes was then examined by supershift assays (Fig. 1B). Incubation of the agonistic LTβR Ab-stimulated protein extracts with anti-RelA and anti-p50 antibodies supershifted complex I almost completely, whereas complex II was effectively supershifted with anti-RelB and anti-p50 antibodies. Antibodies to p52 (Fig. 1B) and c-Rel (data not shown) had very little effect on either complex. LTβR-induced Binding of RelB/p50 Dimers Requires IKKα but Not IKKβ nor IKKγ—To determine which subunit of the IKK complex controls the binding of RelB/p50 dimers in response to LTβR ligation, we analyzed the DNA binding activity of the nuclear NF-κB complexes in IKKα-, IKKβ-, and IKKγ-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 2A) and found that a weak constitutive binding of RelB/p50 (complex II) was present only in MEFs lacking IKKγ. Most importantly, we found that IKKα is absolutely required for the induction of RelB/p50 DNA binding (complex II), whereas IKKβ and IKKγ are not. In contrast, RelA/p50 binding (complex I) was strongly reduced in IKKβ-deficient MEFs and abolished in IKKα- and IKKγ-deficient MEFs. During the preparation of this paper, LTβR-ligation-induced RelB/p50 activation was also reported by others to be independent of IKKγ (47Saitoh T. Nakano H. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 45-51Google Scholar). Because RelB transcription has been reported to be regulated by RelA (48Bren G.D. Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Pennington K.N. Pobst L.J. Paya C.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7722-7733Google Scholar), we also analyzed LTβR-mediated NF-κB DNA binding activity in MEFs lacking RelA. Complex II was clearly induced in the absence of RelA, albeit at somewhat lower levels. A strong constitutive binding of a third complex (complex III) was also observed in these cells. Super-shift assays revealed that complex III corresponds to a p50-containing complex (data not shown). Given that IKKα exerts a specific function that is not controlled by the two other subunits of the IKK complex, it is possible that some of the IKKα present in cells is not incorporated into the large IKKα/IKKβ/IKKγ-containing complex (49.Rothwarf, D. M., and Karin, M. (1999) Sci Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment RE1, www.sciencemag.org,Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we carried out immunodepletion experiments on whole cell extracts from fibroblasts. Five rounds of depletion were performed using an anti-IKKγ antibody, and the IKK subunit content was analyzed after each round by immunoblotting for IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ. IKKβ was almost entirely depleted from the protein extracts after one round of IKKγ depletion (Fig. 2B), showing that most of the IKKβ binds to IKKγ. In contrast, a considerable fraction of IKKα was still detectable after five rounds of IKKγ depletion. This observation suggests the existence of an IKKα-containing complex independent of IKKβ and IKKγ. Whether this alternative complex represents IKKα homodimers or IKKα associated with a different protein(s) remains to be determined. IKKα but Not IKKβ and IKKγ Regulates LTβR-induced p100 Processing and RelB Nuclear Translocation in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—We have previously reported that LTβR-induced processing of p100 generates RelB/p52 dimers that translocate to the nucleus to activate a set of specific target genes (21Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Google Scholar). To determine whether a control mechanism based on p100 processing could also apply to RelB/p50 dimers, we examined p100 and p52 protein levels in WT, IKKα-, IKKβ-, and IKKγ-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 3A). Treatment with anti-LTβR antibody strongly enhanced processing of p100 to p52 in WT fibroblasts but failed to do so in IKKα-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3A). Importantly, LTβR ligation led to p100 processing with kinetics parallel to those of RelB/p50 binding. Although the steady state level of expression of p100 is low in IKKβ- and even lower in IKKγ-deficient fibroblasts compared with WT fibroblasts, p100 processing still occurred in these cells in response to treatment with the agonistic LTβR Ab. Thus, coincident with the induction of RelB/p50 DNA binding (Fig. 2A), IKKα but not IKKβ and IKKγ is also absolutely required for LTβR-induced processing of p100 (Fig. 3A). These results strongly suggest that the IKKα-dependent p100 processing plays a critical role in the regulation of LTβR-induced activation of RelB/p50 dimers. To further investigate underlying mechanisms, we compared intracellular distributions of RelB in LTβR-stimulated IKKα-, IKKβ-, and IKKγ-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3B). We observed that LTβR ligation-induced RelB nuclear localization was abolished in IKKα- but not β- or γ-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3B). In addition, although similar constitutive RelB protein levels were observed in the cytoplasm of the three IKK-deficient cell lines, constitutive RelB levels in the nucleus were markedly greater in IKKγ-deficient cells, which may explain the constitutive RelB/p50 DNA binding activity observed in these cells (Fig. 2A). Taken together, our data demonstrate that IKKα is required for the LTβR-induced activation of RelB/p50 dimers. Most probably, the processing of p100 and thus the removal of this main inhibitory partner of RelB allows RelB nuclear translocation and DNA binding. Nuclear p100 Inhibits RelB/p50 DNA Binding in Response to TNF-α—To determine whether the failure of TNF-α to induce RelB DNA binding is the result of a lack of nuclear translocation of RelB, we compared RelB protein levels and cellular distributions in response to TNF-α versus agonistic LTβR activation in WT MEFs (Fig. 4). TNF-α induction resulted in a strong increase of RelB in both cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas LTβR stimulation markedly increased only nuclear RelB. Importantly, the levels of induced nuclear RelB were similar in response to TNFR and LTβR ligation. Thus, the increased nuclear RelB expression level observed in TNF-α-induced fibroblasts does not lead to an increased binding activity, suggesting a nuclear control of RelB/p50 activity. The absence of TNF-α-induced RelB DNA binding, despite its accumulation in the nucleus, could also be attributed to a lack of production of its heterodimerization partners p50 and p52 and/or to the absence of p100 degradation. Therefore, we also compared the protein levels and cellular distributions of p105/p50 and p100/p52 in TNF-α- and anti-LTβR-treated WT MEFs (Fig. 4). TNFR and LTβR ligation both had very little effect on p105 and p50 protein levels and cellular distribution. Although no nuclear p105 was detected, a fraction of p50 was constitutively present in the nucleus. Within 4 h after TNFR ligation, p100 levels increased slightly in the cytoplasm but strongly in the nucleus. In contrast, LTβR ligation led to p100 processing accompanied by nuclear accumulation of p52 (Fig. 4) with kinetics parallel to those of RelB/p50 binding. Because the availability of RelB for its DNA binding heterodimerization partner p50 is similar in TNF-α and anti-LTβR mAb AC.H6-stimulated fibroblasts, we hypothesized that the TNF-α-induced increase of nuclear p100 might block RelB/p50 DNA binding. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether RelB associates with p100 in the nucleus of TNF-α-treated fibroblasts in vivo. p100 was immunoprecipitated using antibody directed against its C-terminal domain to avoid immunoprecipitation of p52. As shown in Fig. 5A, endogenous RelB coimmunoprecipitates with p100 in the nucleus of TNF-α-activated WT fibroblasts. Importantly, the increase of RelB protein levels parallels the increase of p100 protein levels. In contrast, using whole cell extracts as well as nuclear fractions, no association was detected between RelB and p105 (data not shown). We next investigated whether p100 was able to sequester RelB/p50 dimers within the nucleus of TNF-α-treated cells. To first confirm the existence of such an association, we performed double immunoprecipitation using whole cell extracts from untreated fibroblasts. A first immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-peptide antibody directed against p50 followed by incubation with the corresponding p50 peptide to elute the precipitated proteins. The eluate was then immunoprecipitated with an anti-RelB antibody. An analysis of this second eluate by immunoblotting with an anti-p100 antibody revealed that p100 participates in a multi-protein complex that contains both p50 and RelB (Fig. 5B). The existence of such a p100/RelB/p50 complex is not restricted to fibroblasts. Indeed, we have also observed the association of p100 with RelB/p50 dimers in HT29 cells (see below). To further explore underlying mechanisms, we then used nuclear fractions instead of whole cell extracts in double immunoprecipitation as described above. Most importantly, 8 h of TNF-α stimulation resulted in a strong increase in the association of nuclear RelB/p50 dimers with p100, whereas such an association was not detected in the nucleus of LTβR-activated cells (Fig. 5C). To further elucidate the inhibitory role of p100 on RelB/p50 DNA binding activity downstream of TNFR, we analyzed κB DNA binding activity in NF-κB2-deficient fibroblasts, i.e. lacking p100 (Fig. 6). A constitutive binding of RelB/p50 dimers (complex II) was observed in these cells. Importantly, TNF-α treatment resulted in dramatic increase of RelB/p50 DNA binding (complex II) in the absence of p100, whereas only RelA-containing dimers (complex I) were induced by TNF-α in WT fibroblasts (Fig. 6). Together, these results demonstrate that p100 inhibits TNF-α-induced RelB/p50 DNA binding, most probably via the “trapping” of nuclear RelB/p50 dimers by p100. Ligation of LTβR and TNFR Differentially Regulate Gene Expression—We have shown that LTβR ligation induces both the canonical NF-κB pathway, leading to a rapid and transient activation of RelA/p50 dimers, and the alternative NF-κB pathway, leading to a more delayed and sustained activation of RelB-containing dimers (Ref. 21Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Google Scholar and this report). In contrast, TNF-α only induces the canonical NF-κB pathway, leading primarily to the activation of RelA-containing dimers. To address the physiological relevance of the alternative pathway in the activation of gene expression, WT MEFs were either left untreated or treated with agonistic LTβR mAb or TNF-α for8h and expression of several NF-κB-responsive genes with roles in inflammation was monitored by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 7). LTβR mAb and TNF-α both induced the genes encoding monocytic chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and p100, but expression of other target genes including those for the chemokines RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) and interferon-inducible protein-10 was clearly specifically induced by TNF-α (Fig. 7). None of the genes tested thus far was specifically induced in response to LTβR ligation. Nevertheless, our results indicate that there is only partial overlap in the set of genes induced by LTβR mAb and TNF-α, suggesting that the LTβR-induced activation of p100 processing may control a set of specific target genes that remain to be identified. In the study presented here, we have explored the TNFR- and LTβR-mediated signaling events that control NF-κB activity in fibroblasts. We observe that different IKK subunits are required for RelA and RelB regulation. Consistent with previous observations, the data also show that TNF-α-induced RelA/p50 activation requires IKKβ and IKKγ, whereas IKKα is dispensable (12Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Google Scholar, 15Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Google Scholar). In contrast, no RelB/p50 DNA binding is induced by TNFR ligation, whereas LTβR ligation activates both RelA/p50 and RelB/p50 complexes. In addition, we demonstrate that LTβR-induced binding of RelA/p50 requires IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ, whereas LTβR-induced binding of RelB/p50 absolutely requires IKKα but not IKKβ and IKKγ. Recently, it has been reported that IKKα may function as an essential component of the classical IKK complex, being specifically required for RANKL-mediated activation of this complex in mammary epithelial cells (18Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Google Scholar). The data presented here thus provide a second body of evidence for a crucial role of IKKα in the induction of canonical NF-κB DNA binding activity. In contrast to the canonical NF-κB (RelA/p50), we and others have observed that p100 is the only IκB family member that strongly inhibits RelB activity (48Bren G.D. Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Pennington K.N. Pobst L.J. Paya C.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7722-7733Google Scholar, 51Dobrzanski P. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1003-1007Google Scholar, 52Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Carmona E.M. Bren G.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1405-1418Google Scholar). 2E. Derudder and M. Körner, unpublished data. Recently, we have shown that LTβR-induced IKKα-dependent p100 processing controls RelB/p52 dimer nuclear translocation and gene regulation (21Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the control of p100 processing also plays a critical role in the regulation of LTβR-induced activation of RelB/p50 dimers. Therefore, the newly discovered alternative NF-κB pathway based on p100 processing seems to account not only for the regulation of RelB/p52 dimers but also for that of RelB/p50 dimers. Although RelB/p52 dimers might be expected to result from the processing of RelB/p100 dimers, it was less clear a priori how p100 processing could control RelB/p50 binding activity. Interestingly, we have found that endogenous p100, p50, and RelB can associate in a single multi-protein complex in fibroblasts as well as in HT29 cells. Thus, our data suggest that LTβR ligation releases RelB/p50 dimers from their interaction with full-length p100, allowing RelB nuclear translocation and subsequent DNA binding. Endogenous complexes containing p100 together with RelA/p50 (53Dejardin E. Bonizzi G. Bellahcene A. Castronovo V. Merville M.P. Bours V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1835-1841Google Scholar, 54Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12634-12638Google Scholar) or RelB/p50 (55Dejardin E. Deregowski V. Greimers R. Cai Z. Chouaib S. Merville M.P. Bours V. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3299-3307Google Scholar) have also been found in human breast and lymphoid cancer cells, suggesting that the release of NF-κB dimers from p100 inhibition could represent a more general mechanism for regulation of NF-κB activity. In IKKβ-deficient fibroblasts, we have observed a clear reduction of LTβR-induced binding of RelB/p50 dimers that does not correlate with an impaired processing of p100 or decreased RelB nuclear translocation. Most probably, the diminished RelB/p50 activity is related to the markedly reduced RelB protein expression in these cells (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, a weak constitutive RelB/p50 DNA binding was detected in MEFs lacking IKKγ, correlating with a high constitutive level of nuclear RelB and a very low level of p100 expression in these cells (Fig. 3). A constitutive RelB/p50 DNA binding was also detected in NF-κB2-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 6). These observations suggest that there are at least two levels of complexity in the regulation of RelB/p50 activity: 1) the overall expression level of RelB and p100 proteins; and 2) the control of p100 processing. Although TNF-α signaling did not induce RelB/p50 DNA binding in WT fibroblasts, a marked increase of RelB protein level was observed in the nucleus of these cells. This absence of a direct correlation between the nuclear localization of RelB and its DNA binding activity clearly suggested that an additional negative control of RelB activity existed in the nucleus of TNF-α-treated fibroblasts. Here again, p100 was a good candidate, because the level of nuclear p100 was also strongly increased in response to TNF-α. Indeed, we observe that TNF-α signaling strongly induces RelB/p50 activity in NF-κB2-deficient cells, suggesting that it is not the processing of p100 per se but rather the “removal” of p100 that allows RelB/p50 dimers to bind to the DNA. In addition, we demonstrate that the association of p100 with RelB/p50 dimers is dramatically increased in the nucleus of TNF-α-treated cells. In conclusion, TNF-α-induced assembly of the p100/RelB/p50 multimeric complex in the nucleus seems to account for the inhibition of RelB/p50 DNA binding, implying that p100 controls RelB/p50 dimers not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus. How might full-length p100 interact with NF-κB dimers? NF-κB members all contain an N-terminal Rel homology domain responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and association with the IκBs (3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar, 56Huxford T. Huang D.B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of p100, like the other IκBs, is characterized by an ankyrin-rich domain that interacts with NF-κB via the Rel homology domain. Structures of co-crystals of NF-κB proteins in association with IκBα and IκBβ have been determined previously (56Huxford T. Huang D.B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Google Scholar), and it emerges that the dimerization domain of the NF-κB dimers is the primary region of interaction with IκBs. It seems plausible that p100 might self-associate through its dimerization domain and that its C-terminal ankyrin domain could then serve as a platform for the binding of RelB/p50 dimers. Analyses of NF-κB knock-out mice have revealed that mice lacking p100/p52 have marked defects in splenic microarchitecture very similar to those observed in LTβR-, NIK-, and RelB-deficient mice (29Weih D.S. Yilmaz Z.B. Weih F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1909-1919Google Scholar, 57Futterer A. Mink K. Luz A. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Pfeffer K. Immunity. 1998; 9: 59-70Google Scholar, 58De Togni P. Goellner J. Ruddle N.H. Streeter P.R. Fick A. Mariathasan S. Smith S.C. Carlson R. Shornick L.P. Strauss-Schoenberger J. Russel J.H. Karr R. Chaplin D. Science. 1994; 264: 703-707Google Scholar). Interestingly, during the revisions of this paper, mice lacking RelB were also reported to be deficient in Peyer's patch organogenesis (59Yilmaz Z.B. Weih D.S. Sivakumar V. Weih F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 121-130Google Scholar), a phenotype also observed in NF-κB2-, NIK-, and LTβR-deficient animals. Animals lacking p50 do not show those dramatic developmental defects. Nevertheless, their Peyer's patches are reduced in number and size (60Paxian S. Merkle H. Riemann M. Wilda M. Adler G. Hameister H. Liptay S. Pfeffer K. Schmid R.M. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1853-1868Google Scholar). Therefore, although p50-containing dimers are not absolutely required, they seem to contribute to the Peyer's patch developmental program. Therefore, it is tempting to conclude that the processing of p100 downstream of LTβR is critically involved in the functions of stromal cells during secondary lymphoid organ development, most probably through the control of RelB/p52 and, perhaps to a lesser extent, RelB/p50-responsive genes. In addition to the lymphoid organ defects, RelB-deficient mice display a multi-organ inflammatory syndrome that contributes significantly to premature mortality in these mice (28Weih F. Warr G. Yang H. Bravo R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5211-5218Google Scholar). In an effort to better elucidate the physiological relevance of the LTβR-induced alternative NF-κB pathway, we have performed RT-PCR on several known NF-κB target genes with roles in inflammation. We have observed that in WT fibroblasts, p100 and monocytic chemoattractant protein-1 are induced by ligation of both TNFR and LTβR. Interestingly, MCP-1 was previously found to be specifically regulated by NIK in response to LTβR but not TNFR activation (61Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Google Scholar). Because NIK is required for LTβR-induced p100 processing (21Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Google Scholar), the loss of MCP-1 induction observed in NIK-deficient cells could reflect the lack of activation of RelB-containing dimers. These findings suggest that RelB/p50 dimers control the transcription of inflammatory genes downstream of LTβR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and microarray analyses designed to determine which genes are specifically regulated by RelB heterodimers will provide a direct test of this hypothesis.

https://openalex.org/W2131332449,"NOR-1/NR4A3 is an “orphan member” of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. NOR-1 and its close relatives Nurr1 and Nur77 are members of the NR4A subgroup of nuclear receptors. Members of the NR4A subgroup are induced through multiple signal transduction pathways. They have been implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, T-cell apoptosis, chondrosarcomas, neurological disorders, inflammation, and atherogenesis. However, the mechanism of transcriptional activation, coactivator recruitment, and agonist-mediated activation remain obscure. Hence, we examined the molecular basis of NOR-1-mediated activation. We observed that NOR-1 trans-activates gene expression in a cell- and target-specific manner; moreover, it operates in an activation function (AF)-1-dependent manner. The N-terminal AF-1 domain delimited to between amino acids 1 and 112, preferentially recruits the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC). Furthermore, SRC-2 modulates the activity of the AF-1 domain but not the C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD). Homology modeling indicated that the NOR-1 LBD was substantially different from that of hRORβ, a closely related AF-2-dependent receptor. In particular, the hydrophobic cleft characteristic of nuclear receptors was replaced with a very hydrophilic surface with a distinct topology. This observation may account for the inability of this nuclear receptor LBD to efficiently mediate cofactor recruitment and transcriptional activation. In contrast, the N-terminal AF-1 is necessary for cofactor recruitment and can independently conscript coactivators. Finally, we demonstrate that the purine anti-metabolite 6-mercaptopurine, a widely used antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory drug, activates NOR-1 in an AF-1-dependent manner. Additional 6-mercaptopurine analogs all efficiently activated NOR-1, suggesting that the signaling pathways that modulate proliferation via inhibition of de novo purine and/or nucleic acid biosynthesis are involved in the regulation NR4A activity. We hypothesize that the NR4A subgroup mediates the genotoxic stress response and suggest that this subgroup may function as sensors that respond to genotoxicity.

Renaud J.P. Moras D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 329-359Google Scholar). NRs function as the pipeline between physiology and gene expression. The importance of NRs in human physiology is underscored by the extensive range of therapeutics that has been created to combat disorders associated with dysfunctional hormone signaling. These diseases affect every discipline of medicine (2Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Google Scholar). All members of the NR superfamily display a highly conserved structural organization (1Steinmetz A.C. Renaud J.P. Moras D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 329-359Google Scholar) with an amino-terminal region AB (that encodes activation function 1 (AF-1)), followed by the C-region that encodes the DNA binding domain (DBD), a linker region D, and the C-terminal E region. The DE region encodes the ligand binding domain (LBD) and a transcriptional domain, denoted as activation function 2 (AF-2) (1Steinmetz A.C. Renaud J.P. Moras D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 329-359Google Scholar, 2Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Google Scholar). A decade ago, gene products were identified that appeared to belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily on the basis of their nucleic acid sequence identity. The endogenous signaling molecules that bound to these proteins were unknown; thus, the term “orphan receptor” was adopted. Based on members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that have been more fully characterized, the orphans forecast an enormous yet unexploited opportunity for the discovery of important new therapeutic agents. The Nur77, NURR1, and NOR-1 (NR4A1–3 subgroup) family of orphan NRs are well conserved in the DNA binding domain (∼91–95%) and the C-terminal LBD (∼60%) but divergent in the N-terminal AB region (e.g. AF-1). The NR4A family members can bind as monomers and homodimers to single/tandem copies of the nerve growth factor-inducible response element (NBRE), AAAGGTCA, a variant NR half-site, and constitutively regulate transcription. In addition to binding DNA as monomers, Nur77 and Nurr1 (but not NOR-1) heterodimerize with RXR and mediate efficient trans-activation in response to RXR-specific agonists from DR5 motifs. Moreover, a Nur response element has been found in the promoter region of the pro-opiomelanocortin gene (POMC) that is efficiently bound and transactivated by Nur and NOR-1 homodimers (3Wilson T.E.

In itself, the NR4A1–3 subgroup presents an exciting scientific challenge; unlocking the molecular mechanisms that mediate NR4A-dependent transcription provides the platform for likely pharmaceutical and therapeutic exploitation. NOR-1, Nur77, and NURR1 have been shown to play a key role in regulating expression of various genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (35Fernandez P.M. Brunel F. Jimenez M.A. Saez J.M. Cereghini S. Zakin M.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2392-2400Google Scholar). Corticotropin-releasing hormone treatment of adrenal and pituitary cells induces Nur77 and NOR-1. These events lead to the activation of the gene encoding steroid 12α-hydroxylase (36Davis I.J. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3469-3483Google Scholar, 37Wilson T.E. Mouw C.A. Weaver J.M. Parker K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 861-868Google Scholar). The Nur subfamily also regulates steroid 17-hydroxylase and the 20α-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase promoters (36Davis I.J. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3469-3483Google Scholar, 37Wilson T.E. Mouw C.A. Weaver J.M. Parker K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 861-868Google Scholar, 38Stocco C.O. Zhong L. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Lau L.F. Gibori G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37202-37211Google Scholar). Therefore, the NR4A subgroup plays a role in steroidogenesis. Among other genes that members of the NR4A subfamily regulate in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, which is the precursor to adrenocorticotropic hormone, the chief regulator of adrenal steroidogenesis, and the corticotropin-releasing hormone gene (5Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 10: 5946-5951Google Scholar, 39Murphy E.P. Conneely O.M. Mol.

In response to inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α), there is local up-regulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue, indicating corticotropin-releasing hormone as a component of the inflammatory cascade in arthritis. It has been shown that the NR4A subgroup up-regulates corticotropinreleasing hormone expression by interacting with specific cis-acting sequences in its proximal promoter region. As such, the NR4A family of proteins represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention to control inflammatory responses (25Murphy E.P. McEvoy A. Conneely O.M. Bresnihan B. FitzGerald O. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 782-793Google Scholar, 41McEvoy A.N. Murphy E.A. Ponnio T. Conneely O.M. Bresnihan B. FitzGerald O. Murphy E.P. J.

Gene targeting experiments have established a role for NOR-1 and Nur77 in mediating T cell development. Nur77 and NOR-1 are rapidly induced by the T-cell antigen receptor signaling in immature thymocytes and T-cell hybridomas leading to apoptosis (14Youn H.D. Chatila T.A. Liu J.O.

Apoptosis represents an effective way to eliminate cancerous cells, and a variety of evidence suggests that the NR4A subgroup is involved in the regulation of apoptosis in prostate, lung, gastric, breast, and colon cancer cells (28Zhang X.K.

The NR4A subfamily is further implicated in carcinogenesis by the finding that NOR-1 is involved in a chromosomal translocation with the Ewing's sarcoma gene identified in the extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (45Maltais A. Filion C. Labelle Y. Cancer Lett. 2002; 183: 87-94Google Scholar). Activated smooth muscle cells are a hallmark of pathological vascular processes, including atherosclerosis and restenosis (46Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Google Scholar). It has been established that atheromatous lesions are active sites of inflammation and immune responses, and cytokines mediate the chronic development of atherosclerosis (47Blake G.J. Ridker P.M. Eur. Heart J. 2002; 23: 345-347Google Scholar, 48Young J.L. Libby P. Schonbeck U. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 554-567Google Scholar, 49Blake G.J. Ridker P.M. J. Intern. Med. 2002; 252: 283-294Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the NR4A subgroup is expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions, and inhibition of the NR4A subgroup subfamily transcription factors in smooth muscle cells results in enhanced lesion formation, whereas overexpression of Nur77/NOR-1/Nurr1 decreases neointimal formation. Thus, the NR4A subgroup has a protective function in the initiation and the progression atherogenesis (26Arkenbout E.K. de Waard V. van Bragt M. van Achterberg T.A. Grimbergen J.M. Pichon B. Pannekoek H. de Vries C.J. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1530-1535Google Scholar, 27Monajemi H. Arkenbout E.K. Pannekoek H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 404-412Google Scholar). The importance of NOR-1 as a potential target for anti-cancer, inflammation, and atherogenic drugs underscores the importance of understanding the NOR-1 molecular mechanism of action. Hence, we used a variety of techniques to investigate the critical subdomains and coactivators that mediate its function. In summary, we demonstrated that NOR-1-mediated transcription and co-factor recruitment operated in an AF-1-dependent manner; furthermore, the AF-1 domain was required for NOR-1-dependent transactivation of target genes. In accordance with the role of NOR-1 in inflammation and carcinogenesis, NOR-1 is activated by the anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drug 6-mercaptopurine. Moreover, this thiopurine agent specifically modulates the activity of the AF-1 domain. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Proliferating C2C12 cells and COS-1 cells were kept in DMEM supplemented with 20 and 10% fetal calf serum, respectively, in 6% CO2.

Cells were harvested after 48 h and were assayed for luciferase activity. Each experiment represented at least two sets of independent triplicates to overcome the variability inherent in transfection experiments (52Chen S.L. Loffler K.A. Chen D. Stallcup M.R. Muscat G.E.O.

Generation of full-length mouse NOR-1 was performed by reverse transcriptase-PCR from muscle RNA with Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega), using the manufacturer's buffer. All PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI site of pSG5 and then isolated after EcoRI digestion and subsequently cloned into pGAL0 and pGEX4T1. The primers used for the synthesis of full-length mouse NOR-1 were GMUQ-720 5′ (GCG GAA TTC ACC ATG CCC TGC GTG CAA GCC CAG) and GMUQ-722 3′ (GCG GAA TTC TCA GAA AGG CAG GGT GTC AAG GAA). We then synthesized additional primers to subclone the DE, AB, ABC, and CDE regions into pSG5 and GALO. The primers used for the DE were GMUQ-724 5′ (GCG GAA TTC ACC ATG GTT AAG GAA GTT GTG CGT) and GMUQ-722 3′. The primers used to synthesize the AB region were GMUQ-720 5′ and GMUQ-726 3′ (GCG GAA TTC TCA TGT GCC TTC CCC AGA TGA TGA).

The primers used to synthesize the CDE region were GMUQ-732 5′ (GCG GAA TTC ACC ATG TGT GCC GTG TGC GGC G) and GMUQ-722 3′. We subsequently constructed various subdomains of the AB region by PCR and cloned these segments into the EcoRI/SalI site of GAL4. The NOR-1-AB-aa1–150 was subjected to PCR and cloned into SV40-GAL0 using primers GMUQ-720 5′ and GMUQ-756 3′ (GCG GTC GAC TCA GGG GAA GCC TGG AGT GG).

We then synthesized several primers for site-directed mutagenesis and used the Stratagene QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit as per the manufacturer's instructions to produce GAL4-NOR-1-AB chimeras that simultaneously carried double, triple, and quadruple amino acid mutations. NOR-1-AB mutant primers were synthesized and 5′-phosphorylated by GENEWORKS.

The GST fusion proteins were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels for integrity and to normalize the amount of each protein. The Promega TNT-coupled transcription-translation system was used to produce [35S]methioninelabeled NOR-1 and coactivator proteins that were visualized by SDS-PAGE. In vitro binding assays were performed with glutathioneagarose beads (Sigma) coated with ∼500 ng of GST fusion protein and 2–10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled protein in 200 μl of binding buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg of ethidium bromide, and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin.

https://openalex.org/W2011065045,"Histone modifying enzymes contribute to the activation or inactivation of transcription by ultimately catalyzing the unfolding or further compaction, respectively, of chromatin structure. Actively transcribed genes are typically hyperacetylated at Lys residues of histones H3 and H4 and hypermethylated at Lys-4 of histone H3 (H3–K4). To determine whether covalent histone modifications play a role in the β cell-specific expression of the insulin gene, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using anti-histone antibodies and extracts from β cell lines, non-β cell lines, and ES cells, and quantitated specific histone modifications at the insulin promoter by real-time PCR. Our studies reveal that the proximal insulin promoter is hyperacetylated at histone H3 only in β cells. This hyperacetylation is highly correlated to recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase p300 to the proximal promoter in β cells, and is consistent with the role of hyperacetylation in promoting euchromatin formation. We also observed that the proximal insulin promoter of β cells is hypermethylated at H3–K4, and that this modification is correlated to the recruitment of the histone methyltransferase SET7/9 to the promoter. ES cells demonstrate a histone modification pattern intermediate between that of β cells and non-β cells, and is consistent with their potential to express the insulin gene. We therefore propose a model in which insulin transcription in the β cell is facilitated by a unique combination of transcription factors that acts in the setting of an open, euchromatic structure of the insulin gene. Histone modifying enzymes contribute to the activation or inactivation of transcription by ultimately catalyzing the unfolding or further compaction, respectively, of chromatin structure. Actively transcribed genes are typically hyperacetylated at Lys residues of histones H3 and H4 and hypermethylated at Lys-4 of histone H3 (H3–K4). To determine whether covalent histone modifications play a role in the β cell-specific expression of the insulin gene, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using anti-histone antibodies and extracts from β cell lines, non-β cell lines, and ES cells, and quantitated specific histone modifications at the insulin promoter by real-time PCR. Our studies reveal that the proximal insulin promoter is hyperacetylated at histone H3 only in β cells. This hyperacetylation is highly correlated to recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase p300 to the proximal promoter in β cells, and is consistent with the role of hyperacetylation in promoting euchromatin formation. We also observed that the proximal insulin promoter of β cells is hypermethylated at H3–K4, and that this modification is correlated to the recruitment of the histone methyltransferase SET7/9 to the promoter. ES cells demonstrate a histone modification pattern intermediate between that of β cells and non-β cells, and is consistent with their potential to express the insulin gene. We therefore propose a model in which insulin transcription in the β cell is facilitated by a unique combination of transcription factors that acts in the setting of an open, euchromatic structure of the insulin gene. The pancreatic β cell is exclusively responsible for the synthesis and secretion of insulin. The production of insulin appears to be governed by constraints imposed at the level of transcription of the gene encoding insulin (Ins), 1Throughout the text, the gene symbol Ins refers to both the mouse Ins1 and Ins2 genes. 1Throughout the text, the gene symbol Ins refers to both the mouse Ins1 and Ins2 genes. and involves an intricate interplay between transcription factors that are known to function as transactivators of the gene. In recent years, specific DNA elements within the proximal ∼400 base pairs (bp) of the Ins promoter have been mapped precisely and shown to be bound by several major classes of transactivating transcription factors, including homeodomain factors (Pdx1, Lmx1.1), basic helix loop helix factors (NeuroD1, E47), and bZip factors (mMafA) (see Ref. 1Chakrabarti S.K. Mirmira R.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 78-84Google Scholar for review). In addition, coactivators such as p300 (by virtue of its interaction with Pdx1, NeuroD1, and E47) have also been suggested to contribute to Ins gene regulation (2Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Google Scholar, 3Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-420Google Scholar). Thus, it is hypothesized that the unique combination of ubiquitous and cell type-specific factors within the β cell results in the transcription of the Ins gene (3Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-420Google Scholar, 4German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Google Scholar, 5Shieh S.-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis alone cannot explain why heterologous expression of β cell factors results in activation of the endogenous Ins gene in only limited, “responsive” cell types (e.g. liver, pancreatic ductal cells, and embryonic and intestinal stem cells) (6Blyszczuk P.

Although this finding suggests that “unresponsive” cell types are still missing some critical genetic component (transcription factor or signaling pathway) that is necessary for gene activation, it also raises the possibility that epigenetic variables relating to the chromatin structure of the Ins gene might preclude transcription factor action in these cell types. An important paradigm in transcriptional regulation is the influence of the higher order chromatin structure on the rate of gene transcription. In eukaryotes, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 make up the proteins of the core nucleosomal unit of chromatin, around which 146 bp of DNA are wrapped (11Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Google Scholar). The higher order structure of chromatin is dependent upon the spatial organization of the core nucleosomal units with respect to one another. Although this packaging of chromatin is responsible for the efficient storage of genetic material within the nucleus, it also has the capacity to impede the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors (11Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Google Scholar, 12Anderson J.D. Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 977-985Google Scholar). An emerging theme in chromatin structural dynamics is the effect of covalent histone modifications in altering higher order chromatin structure, and hence in altering rates of gene transcription. Several covalent modifications of the basic N-terminal tails of all histones have been described, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination (see Ref. 13Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar for review). Of these, acetylation and methylation of specific Lys residues of H3 and H4 have been studied extensively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 2The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Ins, insulin; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HMT, histone methyltransferase; ES, embryonic stem; RT, reverse transcriptase. 2The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Ins, insulin; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HMT, histone methyltransferase; ES, embryonic stem; RT, reverse transcriptase. assays using mammalian and yeast cells have demonstrated that transcriptionally active genes in regions of “open” chromatin (“euchromatin”) are correlated with high levels of Lys acetylation of histones H3 and H4, whereas inactive genes in regions of “closed” chromatin (“heterochromatin”) are hypoacetylated at these histones (14Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Google Scholar, 15Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Google Scholar). Lys acetylation and deacetylation are catalyzed by the action of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases, respectively; thus, in addition to serving as a long term epigenetic marker for euchromatin, histone acetylation is also viewed as a dynamic, short term mechanism to control gene transcription (14Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Google Scholar). At least two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effect of histone acetylation on chromatin structure and transcription. First, acetylation of Lys residues is known to diminish the positive charge in the N-terminal histone tails, and thereby mitigate electrostatic interactions between histones and DNA and promote chromatin unfolding. Second, the acetylation “mark” of these Lys residues is thought to be recognized by proteins containing the conserved bromodomain. These proteins subsequently recruit components of the basal transcriptional machinery to promote transcriptional activation (16Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Google Scholar). Unlike acetylation, Lys methylation can have divergent effects on transcriptional activation, depending upon the specific residue modified. Thus, methylation of Lys-4 of histone H3 (H3–K4) is associated with euchromatin, whereas methylation of Lys-9 of histone H3 (H3–K9) is observed with heterochromatin (17Noma K. Grewal S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16438-16445Google Scholar, 18Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Google Scholar, 19Peters A.H. Mermoud J.E. O'Carroll D. Pagani M. Schweizer D. Brockdorff N. Jenuwein T. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 77-80Google Scholar). Lys methylation is catalyzed by the action of histone methyltransferases (HMTs), which demonstrate a high degree of specificity for either H3–K4 (e.g. SET7/9, Refs. 20Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Borchers C. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1207-1217Google Scholar and 21Nishioka K. Chuikov S. Sarma K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 479-489Google Scholar) or H3–K9 (e.g. SUV39H1, Ref 22Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Google Scholar). Because no histone demethylases have yet been described, histone methylation is not generally believed to be dynamically regulated (as acetylation), but rather is viewed as a long term epigenetic marker for chromatin states (23Bannister A.J. Schneider R. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2002; 109: 801-806Google Scholar). Although Lys methylation does not alter net charge of histone tails (unlike acetylation), the methyl mark is believed to either enhance or repress the binding of chromatin remodeling complexes that contain the conserved chromodomain (e.g. HP1 and NuRD deacetylase, respectively), thereby contributing to altered chromatin conformation (24Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Google Scholar, 25Zegerman P. Canas B. Pappin D. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11621-11624Google Scholar). Hence, regions of transcriptionally active genes are characterized by histone acetylation and/or histone H3–K4 methylation, whereas regions of inactive genes are hypoacetylated and/or contain histone H3–K9 methylation. To explain Ins gene transcription in the β cell more fully, we hypothesized that β cells contain a characteristic set of histone modifications that lend a state of euchromatin in the region of the Ins gene. To test this hypothesis, we performed quantitative ChIP assays using anti-histone antisera and extracts from β cell lines (βTC3 and MIN6) and several non-β-cell lines (αTC1.6, mPAC, NIH3T3, and ES cells) to examine the chromatin structure of the proximal and distal mouse Ins promoter. Our hypothesis proved correct, as we found that β cells display a characteristic pattern of H3 hyperacetylation in the proximal Ins promoter, and that this acetylation is highly correlated to recruitment of the HAT p300 to this promoter region. In addition, we found that the proximal Ins promoter in β cells is hypermethylated at H3–K4, and that this modification is consistent with the recruitment of the HMT SET7/9 to this region of the promoter. We therefore propose a model in which Ins transcription in the β cell is facilitated by a unique combination of transcription factors that acts in the setting of an open, euchromatic structure of the Ins gene. Cell Culture and Antibodies—The mouse cell lines, βTC3, αTC1.6, mPAC, NIH3T3, MIN6, and embryonic stem (ES) D3 were maintained as described (26Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Google Scholar, 27Yoshida T. Hanahan D. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 671-684Google Scholar, 28Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to acetylated-H3, acetylated-H4, H3-dimethyl-K4, H3-dimethyl-K9, and SET7/9 were generously provided by Upstate Biotech, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to p300 (N-15) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Multiplex Real-time RT-PCR—Real-time RT-PCR using dual-labeled probes and total RNA from cells lines was performed as described previously (30Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Google Scholar). Forward primer, reverse primer, and probe sequences (5′ to 3′), respectively, for real-time RT-PCRs were: mouse I insulin, TGGCTTCTTCTACACACCCAAG, ACAATGCCACGCTTCTGCC, and (AmC6 + Texas Red)-CCCGCCGTGAAGTGGAGGACCC-(BHQ); actin, AGGTCATCACTATTGGCAACGA, CACTTCATGATGGAATTGAATGTAGTT, and (6-FAM)-TGCCACAGGATTCCATACCCAAGAAGG-(BHQ). Quantitative ChIP Assays—The quantitative ChIP assays were performed as described previously (26Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Google Scholar). For harvesting of ES cells, feeder embryonic fibroblasts were removed by trypsinizing cells from 10-cm plates and replating on fresh 10-cm tissue culture dishes. Approximately 30 min later, medium (containing mostly ES cells) was aspirated and replated. This process was repeated a total of 3 times, after which the medium (containing >90% ES cells) was processed for ChIP as described (26Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitated promoter fragments were quantitated by real-time PCR using continuous SYBR Green I monitoring as detailed previously (26Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Google Scholar). Prior to ChIP, 1 μg of a plasmid containing the firefly luciferase coding sequence (pFoxLuc) was added to each cellular extract and was used to correct for differences in DNA recovery between samples after the ChIP procedure. This was accomplished by determining the quantity of recovered luciferase DNA in each sample by realtime PCR, and using this value to correct the recovery of the Ins promoter fragments. Data were expressed as fold-differences relative to control conditions, in which normal rabbit serum was used instead of specific antibody in the ChIP. In practice, DNA fragments are nonspecifically and reproducibly recovered after ChIP in the absence of antibody, but are often amplified 0–6 cycles later than specifically recovered fragments. Thus, data expressed relative to these control conditions allow for (a) correction in the variation of background DNA precipitation from cell line to cell line, and (b) assessment of the absolute enrichment of specific DNA fragments after ChIP in any given cell line (26Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Google Scholar, 31Christenson L.K. Stouffer R.L. Strauss 3rd, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27392-27399Google Scholar, 32Kiekhaefer C.M.

ChIP assays were performed on at least 3 independent occasions; for each ChIP assay, promoter samples were quantitated in triplicate on two separate occasions. Thus, for every sample in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, data represent the average of at least 6 determinations ± S.D., and are presented as fold-differences relative to control conditions (in which normal rabbit serum is used instead of specific antibody in the ChIP).Fig. 3p300 is recruited to the proximal Ins promoter in βTC3 cells and accounts for H3 hyperacetylation of the promoter.A, quantitative ChIP assay showing association of p300 with the proximal promoter only of βTC3 cells, and not with either promoter region in αTC1.6 and mPAC cells.

D, HAT assay samples were subject to electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by fluorography to determine acetylation distribution patterns. The acetylation distribution pattern of recombinant p300 catalytic subunit using calf thymus histones (lane 1) or bovine serum albumin (lane 2) demonstrates the near equal pattern of acetylation of H3 and H4. The acetylation distribution pattern of p300 immunoprecipitated from βTC3 cells using calf thymus histones (lane 3) or bovine serum albumin (lane 4) demonstrates that native p300 displays catalytic specificity for H3 over H4, H2A, and H2B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4H3–K4 and H3–K9 methylation patterns of the distal and proximal Ins promoter in β cell and non-β cell lines.

Data are also expressed as the ratio of H3–K4 to H3–K9 methylation (C), which represents the data in panel A divided by the corresponding value in panel B.

PCR products were subcloned into the T/A cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and several resulting clones were sequenced to confirm the identity of the amplified fragment. Primer pairs for the proximal mouse Ins1 promoter equally and effectively amplified the corresponding fragment from both the mouse Ins1 and Ins2 genes. Immunoprecipitation-HAT Assays—Immunoprecipitation-HAT assays using anti-p300 antibody and extracts from βTC3, αTC1.6, and mPAC cells were performed essentially as described (33Mizzen C.A. Yang X.J. Kokubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J. Owen-Hughes T. Workman J. Wang L. Berger S.L. Kouzarides T. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1261-1270Google Scholar). HAT reactions (in 30 μl total volume) consisted of immunoprecipitate or 10 units of purified p300 catalytic subunit (positive control, Upstate Biotechnology), 10 μg of calf thymus histones (Worthington) or bovine serum albumin (negative control), and 0.2 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences). After 30 min, HAT reactions were subject either to filter binding assays (33Mizzen C.A. Yang X.J. Kokubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J. Owen-Hughes T. Workman J. Wang L. Berger S.L. Kouzarides T. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1261-1270Google Scholar) to determine incorporation of [3H]acetyl group into histones or to electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by fluorography to determine relative H3 versus H4 [3H]acetate incorporation. HAT data are presented as picomoles of [3H]acetate incorporated into histones or bovine serum albumin per min, and are normalized to the total amount of protein used in each immunoprecipitation. Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear extracts from all cell lines were prepared from single, confluent 10-cm plates of cells according to methods described previously (34Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from confluent 10-cm plates of cells by scraping cells into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin) and sonicating briefly. 5 μg of nuclear or whole cell extract were subject to Western blot analysis after electrophoresis on an 8 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using antiacetylated H3, anti-H3-dimethyl-K4, anti-p300, or anti-SET7/9 antibodies. Western blots were visualized using the ECL-Plus™ system (Amersham Biosciences). H3 and H4 Acetylation at the Ins Promoter—In these studies we used two mouse β-cell-derived lines (MIN6 and βTC3, Refs. 28Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Google Scholar and 35Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod H. Spector D. Delannoy M. Grant S. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9037-9041Google Scholar), a fibroblast line (NIH3T3 cells), an α cell line (αTC1.6, Ref. 36Powers A.C. Efrat S. Mojsov S. Spector D. Habener J.F. Hanahan D. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 406-414Google Scholar), a pancreatic ductal cell line (mPAC, Ref. 27Yoshida T. Hanahan D. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 671-684Google Scholar), and ES cells. To verify the presence or absence of Ins gene expression, we isolated total RNA from each cell line and performed 50 cycles of real-time RT-PCR to amplify Ins message. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, only MIN6 and βTC3 cells showed detectable transcript levels, consistent with the observation that Ins gene transcription is highly specific for β cells. We used a real-time PCR-based ChIP assay (26Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Google Scholar) to quantitate the association of covalently modified histones with the Ins promoter in each cell line. Because only the proximal ∼400 bp of the Ins promoter appears to be necessary to direct exclusive expression of Ins in β cells (37Karlsson O. Edlund T. Moss J.B. Rutter W.J. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8819-8823Google Scholar), we designed PCR primer pairs to amplify a fragment of DNA within this region (bp –126 to –296 relative to the Ins1 transcriptional start site) following ChIP. For comparison, we also designed PCR primer pairs to amplify a distal genomic fragment (from bp –4653 to –4812 relative to the Ins1 transcriptional start site) in a region known not to be critical for Ins regulation (for simplicity, we refer to this region as the distal Ins promoter). The relative association of acetylated H3 and acetylated H4 with the distal and proximal Ins promoters was assessed by ChIP in βTC3, MIN6, NIH3T3, αTC1.6, mPAC, and ES cells. Fig. 2A demonstrates that β cells (βTC3 and MIN6) show striking levels of H3 acetylation at the proximal (10.5- and 18-fold, respectively, over controls) and, to a lesser extent, the distal promoter. By contrast, little or no Ins promoter H3 acetylation was observed in NIH3T3, αTC1.6, or mPAC cells. Importantly, ES cells contain a moderate level of H3 acetylation at the proximal promoter (about 5-fold over control), consistent with a more intermediate conformation of chromatin in this undifferentiated cell type. Fig. 2B demonstrates that there is little difference in H4 acetylation at the proximal promoter between β cells and the other cell types. Interestingly, ES cells contain relatively high levels of H4 acetylation (20-fold over control) at the proximal promoter, again consistent with a more open conformation of chromatin in this cell type. Overall, these data demonstrate that the Ins promoter of β cells is distinguished by hyperacetylation of H3. The H3 and H4 acetylation patterns of the distal Ins promoter of all cell types seem to parallel the patterns observed in their corresponding proximal promoter regions (compare Fig. 2, A and B). However, hyperacetylation of H3 relative to H4 may be the more indicative of the regulatory role of the proximal Ins promoter. As shown in Fig. 2C, the ratio of H3 to H4 acetylation is significantly greater (by 5–10-fold) in the proximal Ins promoter of β cells compared with all other cell types, whereas there is no significant difference in this ratio among the cell types in the distal Ins promoter. Thus, these data demonstrate that the proximal Ins promoter is hyperacetylated at H3 relative to H4 in β cells, suggesting a more open chromatin conformation of the promoter in these cells. p300 Directs Proximal Ins Promoter H3 Hyperacetylation in β Cells—It has been shown previously that the coactivator p300 physically interacts with several important β cell transcription factors (Pdx1, NeuroD1, and HNFα), and is capable of augmenting transactivation of the Ins promoter by these factors (2Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Google Scholar, 3Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-420Google Scholar, 38Soutoglou E. Papafotiou G. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12515-12520Google Scholar). Because p300 contains intrinsic HAT activity (39An W. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1504-1510Google Scholar), we sought to determine by ChIP if p300 is directly recruited to the proximal Ins promoter of β cells and whether its catalytic activity could account for the relative H3 hyperacetylation we observed. For these studies, we used 3 representative pancreatic cell lines: αTC1.6, mPAC, and βTC3. As shown in Fig. 3A, p300 is directly associated only with the proximal Ins promoter in βTC3 cells (but not αTC1.6 or mPAC cells), notwithstanding that p300 protein and HAT activity are detectable in all cell types examined (Fig. 3, B and C, respectively). Fig. 3D demonstrates that whereas the recombinant p300 catalytic subunit acetylates H3 and H4 equally in vitro (lane 1), full-length p300 immunoprecipitated from βTC3 cells preferentially acetylates H3 (lane 3). This finding is similar to other in vitro studies showing preferential acetylation of H3 by p300 (20Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Borchers C. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1207-1217Google Scholar, 39An W. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1504-1510Google Scholar), and is therefore consistent with the concept that p300 recruitment is responsible for H3 hyperacetylation at the proximal Ins promoter. H3 Methylation at the Ins Promoter—H3–K4 methylation indicates regions of euchromatin and active genes, whereas H3–K9 methylation is associated with regions of heterochromatin and inactive genes. To determine whether H3 methylation is linked to activity of the Ins promoter, we performed quantitative ChIP assays using anti-H3-dimethyl-K4 and anti-H3-dimethyl-K9 antibodies and extracts from β cells and non-β-cells. As illustrated in Fig. 4A high levels of H3–K4 methylation are present in the proximal Ins promoter of βTC3 and MIN6 cells (36- and 22-fold, respectively, relative to controls), whereas all non-insulin-producing cell types showed 2–6-fold relative methylation. H3–K4 methylation was significantly lower in the distal promoter of βTC3 and MIN6 cell"
https://openalex.org/W2059960512,"2-Arachidonoylglycerol is an endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and has been shown to exhibit a variety of cannabimimetic activities in vitro and in vivo. Recently, we proposed that 2-arachidonoylglycerol is the true endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptors, and both receptors (CB1 and CB2) are primarily 2-arachidonoylglycerol receptors. The CB1 receptor is assumed to be involved in the attenuation of neurotransmission. On the other hand, the physiological roles of the CB2 receptor, which is abundantly expressed in several types of leukocytes such as macrophages, still remain unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of 2-arachidonoylglycerol on the motility of HL-60 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells. We found that 2-arachidonoylglycerol induces the migration of differentiated HL-60 cells. The migration induced by 2-arachidonoylglycerol was blocked by treatment of the cells with either SR144528, a CB2 receptor antagonist, or pertussis toxin, suggesting that the CB2 receptor and Gi/Go are involved in the 2-arachidonoylglycerol-induced migration. Several intracellular signaling molecules such as Rho kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases were also suggested to be involved. In contrast to 2-arachidonoylglycerol, anandamide, another endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligand, failed to induce the migration. The 2-arachidonoylglycerol-induced migration was also observed for two other types of macrophage-like cells, the U937 cells and THP-1 cells, as well as human peripheral blood monocytes. These results strongly suggest that 2-arachidonoylglycerol induces the migration of several types of leukocytes such as macrophages/monocytes through a CB2 receptor-dependent mechanism thereby stimulating inflammatory reactions and immune responses. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol is an endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and has been shown to exhibit a variety of cannabimimetic activities in vitro and in vivo.

In 1988, Devane et al. (1Devane W.A. Dysarz III, F.A. Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 34: 605-613Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of a specific binding site for cannabinoids in rat brain synaptosomes. Later, Matsuda et al. (2Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I. Nature. 1990; 346: 561-564Google Scholar) and Munro et al. (3Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Google Scholar) cloned the cDNAs for the cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). It has been assumed that the diverse actions of the cannabinoids are mediated in a large part through these receptors. In 1992, Devane et al. (4Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G.

Science. 1992; 258: 1946-1949Google Scholar) isolated N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide) from pig brain as an endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligand. This compound has been shown to exhibit various cannabimimetic activities in vitro and in vivo (5Di Marzo V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 153-175Google Scholar, 6Piomelli D. Beltramo M.

Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 173-192Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggested the existence of another endogenous ligand in mammalian tissues. In 1995, we (11Sugiura T. Kondo S. Sukagawa A. Nakane S. Shinoda A. Itoh K. Yamashita A. Waku K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 89-97Google Scholar) and Mechoulam et al. (12Mechoulam R.

Moreover, 2-AG can be rapidly formed from arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids, such as inositol phospholipids, through the combined actions of phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase or the combined actions of phospholipase A1 and phospholipase C in various types of tissues and cells upon stimulation (20Bisogno T.

Noticeably, the levels of 2-AG in various mammalian tissues are markedly higher than that of anandamide. Based on these results, we proposed that 2-AG, and not anandamide, is the intrinsic natural ligand for the cannabinoid receptors (15Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Nakane S. Miyashita T. Kondo S. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. Seki C. Baba N. Ishima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2794-2801Google Scholar, 16Sugiura T. Kondo S. Kishimoto S. Miyashita T. Nakane S. Kodaka T. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. J.

Despite their potential physiological and pathophysiological importance, the exact functions of the CB1 and CB2 receptors and their endogenous ligand 2-AG have not yet been fully elucidated. As for the CB1 receptor, several lines of evidence strongly suggested that 2-AG suppresses the neurotransmission through acting at the CB1 receptor expressed predominantly in the presynapse (10Sugiura T. Kobayashi Y. Oka S. Waku K. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 173-192Google Scholar, 13Sugiura T. Waku K. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 89-106Google Scholar, 14Sugiura T. Waku K. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 7-12Google Scholar). It is becoming evident that 2-AG is a novel type of neuromodulator of profound physiological significance. On the other hand, the functions of the CB2 receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the immune system, still remain an enigma. Little is known concerning the biological activities of 2-AG toward inflammatory cells and immune competent cells. It is essential to investigate in detail the functions of the CB2 receptor and 2-AG to better understand the precise regulatory mechanisms of inflammatory reactions and immune responses. In this study, we investigated the possible biological activity of 2-AG toward HL-60 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells. We found that 2-AG induces the migration of differentiated HL-60 cells through a cannabinoid CB2 receptor-dependent mechanism. A similar effect was also observed with human monocytes. The physiological and pathophysiological meanings of the 2-AG-induced migration of macrophages/monocytes are discussed. Chemicals—Arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1n-9), linoleic acid (18:2n-6), eicosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and LY294002 were purchased from Sigma. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), wortmannin, and herbimycin A were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Eicosa-5,8,11-trienoic acid (mead acid) (20:3n-9) was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). SR141716A was acquired from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). CP55940 and Y-27632 were purchased from Tocris (Bristol, United Kingdom). WIN55212–2 was obtained from RBI (Natick, MA). PD98059 and SB203580 were acquired from Calbiochem. Pertussis toxin (PTX) was obtained from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). SR144528 was a generous gift from Sanofi (Montpellier, France). 1,3-Benzylideneglycerol was prepared as described in Ref. 15Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Nakane S. Miyashita T. Kondo S. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. Seki C. Baba N. Ishima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2794-2801Google Scholar. 2-AG and the other monoacylglycerols were prepared from 1,3-benzylideneglycerol and respective fatty acids as described earlier (15Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Nakane S. Miyashita T. Kondo S. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. Seki C. Baba N. Ishima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2794-2801Google Scholar). An ether-linked analog of 2-AG (2-AG ether) (2-eicosa-5′,8′,11′,14′-tetraenylglycerol) was synthesized from 1,3-benzylideneglycerol and eicosatetraenyl iodide as described previously (15Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Nakane S. Miyashita T. Kondo S. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. Seki C. Baba N. Ishima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2794-2801Google Scholar). Cells—Human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, human monocytic leukemia U937 cells, and THP-1 cells were grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (Asahi Technoglass Co., Chiba, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. HL-60 cells were differentiated into macrophage-like cells by treatment with 100 nm 1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3 for 5 days. U937 cells and THP-1 cells were also differentiated by treatment with 100 nm 1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3 for 5 days. Human monocytes were separated from the peripheral blood of young healthy donors as follows: ¼ volume of 6% dextran T-500 (Amersham Biosciences) in saline was added to heparinized blood to sediment the erythrocytes, the supernatant (leukocyterich fraction) was aspirated and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min, the cells were washed once with Ca2+, Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and then the cells were transferred onto Lymphoprep™ (Axis Shield, Oslo, Norway) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min. The mononuclear leukocyte fraction (the interface layer) was collected and washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Monocytes were separated from other mononuclear leukocytes by negative selection using a MACS monocyte isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec Gmbh, Gladbach, Germany). The purity of the monocytes was 93% as assessed by a nonspecific esterase assay described below. Migration Assay—The migration of the differentiated HL-60 cells, U937 cells, THP-1 cells, and human monocytes was assayed using Transwell™ inserts (pore size, 5 μm) and 24-well culture plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). Briefly, the cells (106 for the differentiated HL-60 cells, U937 cells, and THP-1 cells and 2.5 × 105 for human monocytes) suspended in 0.1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were transferred to the Transwell™ insert (the upper compartment). 2-AG was dissolved in Me2SO and added to 0.6 ml of the RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the well of the culture plate (the lower compartment) (the final concentration of Me2SO was 0.2%). After the incubation at 37 °C (for 4 h for HL-60 cells, U937 cells, and THP-1 cells and 2 h for human monocytes) in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2, the number of cells that migrated from the upper compartment to the lower compartment was counted using a hemocytometer. NBT Reduction Assay—The NBT reduction assay was performed as described previously (28Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 969-974Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were suspended in 25 mm HEPES-Tyrode's solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% NBT and incubated at 37 °C for 7 min. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was added to the cell suspension at a concentration of 4 μm, and the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After the addition of 10 mm EDTA to stop the reaction, the percentage of positive cells (blue-stained cells) was determined using a hemocytometer. Nonspecific Esterase Assay—Nonspecific esterase activity was assayed using an α-naphtyl acetate esterase assay kit (Sigma). Northern Blot Analysis—poly(A)+ RNAs (5 μg) from undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells were electrophoresed in a 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The CB2 probe (human CB2 receptor cDNA SphI/SfiI digest; 524 bp) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe (BD Biosciences) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed at 60 °C for 16 h in QuikHyb solution (Stratagene). The filter was washed in 0.1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and analyzed by a bioimaging analyzer BAS 1500 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Estimation of the Amount of Remaining 2-AG Following the Incubation with the Cells—HL-60 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells (4 × 106) were suspended in 0.4 ml of RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were then incubated with 1 μm 2-AG for 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h. Following the incubation, the supernatant was aspirated, and the lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (29Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). Butylated hydroxytoluene (final, 0.05%) was added to avoid lipid peroxidation, and 2-heptadecanoylglycerol was added as an internal standard. The lipids were fractionated by TLC using development with petroleum ether: diethyl ether:acetic acid (20:80:1, v/v) in a tank sealed with N2 gas. The area corresponding to standard monoacylglycerol was scraped off the TLC plate, followed by extraction from the silica gel by the method of Bligh and Dyer (29Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The extraction was conducted in the presence of butylated hydroxytoluene (0.001%) in an N2 gas-sealed tube. The purified monoacylglycerols were converted to their 1-anthroyl derivatives and then analyzed with a high pressure liquid chromatography system equipped with a reverse phase column (CAPCELL PAK C18 SG120, 4.6 mm × 250 mm; Shiseido Co., Tokyo, Japan) and a fluorescence detector (excitation at 370 nm, emission at 470 nm). The mobile phase was acetonitrile:2-propanol:water (90:4:6, v/v), and the flow rate was 1.4 ml/min as described previously (30Kondo S. Kondo H. Nakane S. Kodaka T. Tokumura A. Waku K. Sugiura T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 152-156Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. 1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3 is known to induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophage-like cells (31Munker R. Norman A. Koeffler H.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 424-430Google Scholar). We first examined the effect of 1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3-treatment on several cellular markers of differentiation and the CB2 receptor mRNA level in HL-60 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, the percentage of NBT reduction assay-positive cells in undifferentiated HL-60 cells was low (10.0%). On the other hand, the proportion of NBT reduction assay-positive cells was elevated to 65.7% following the differentiation with 1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3. A similar result was observed for nonspecific esterase-positive cells (data not shown). We next examined whether differentiated HL-60 cells actually possess the CB2 receptor mRNA. As shown in Fig. 1B, differentiated HL-60 cells were found to contain a substantial amount of the CB2 receptor mRNA. The ratio of the CB2 receptor mRNA/GAPDH mRNA in the differentiated HL-60 cells was almost the same as that in the undifferentiated HL-60 cells (the ratio of the CB2 receptor mRNA/GAPDH mRNA in the differentiated cells was 0.9 of that in the undifferentiated cells). We then investigated the effect of 2-AG on the motility of HL-60 cells. The addition of 1 μm 2-AG enhanced the migration of undifferentiated HL-60 cells to some extent, although the number of migrated cells was low; the percentages of the migrated cells were 0.05 and 0.30% for the control and 2-AG-stimulated cells, respectively. On the other hand, 1 μm 2-AG exerted dramatic effects on the migration of the HL-60 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells by treatment with 1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3 for 5 days. The proportion of migrated cells was 3.4% for the control and 26.7% for the 2-AG-stimulated cells. The number of migrated HL-60 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells was augmented with time (FIG. 2A). The addition of 1 μm 2-AG markedly accelerated the migration (Fig. 2A). The number of migrated cells also increased dose-dependently (Fig. 2B). The effect was observed from 10 nm 2-AG and reached a peak at 10 μm. The EC50 was around 430 nm. We next examined whether the cannabinoid receptors are involved in the 2-AG-induced migration of differentiated HL-60 cells. We found that the addition of SR144528, a cannabinoid CB2 receptor-specific antagonist, to the cells markedly reduced the migration induced by 2-AG (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the treatment of the cells with SR141716A, a cannabinoid CB1 receptor-specific antagonist, exerted only a slight effect on the 2-AG-evoked migration. These results indicate that the 2-AG-induced migration is mediated mainly via the CB2 receptor. The effect of PTX treatment on the 2-AG-induced migration of the differentiated HL-60 cells was next examined. As shown in Fig. 3B, pretreatment of the cells with PTX abolished the migration triggered by 2-AG, indicating that Gi/Go is involved in the 2-AG-induced migration. We further examined the effects of various inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways on 2-AG-induced cell migration. As shown in Fig. 4, PD98059 (a p42/44 MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor; 20 μm), SB203580 (a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor; 20 μm), and Y-27632 (a Rho kinase inhibitor; 20 μm) suppressed the migration of differentiated HL-60 cells induced by 2-AG. On the other hand, LY294002 (a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor; 20 μm) and herbimycin A (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor; 20 μm) did not affect the migration markedly. We also confirmed that wortmannin (a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor; 200 nm) did not influence the migration at all (data not shown).Fig. 4Effects of various inhibitors on 2-AG-induced migration of HL-60 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells by treatment with 1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3. HL-60 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells were treated with various inhibitors (20 μm) at 37 °C for 1 h and then transferred to the Transwell™ (the upper compartment). A, vehicle (Me2SO) was added to the lower compartment. B, 2-AG (1 μm) was added to the lower compartment. The migration of the cells from the upper compartment to the lower compartment was examined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are the means ± S.D. of four determinations. ***, p < 0.001 (compared with the control (open bar)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then compared the activities of the various cannabinoid receptor ligands to induce migration. As shown in Fig. 5, the activity of 2-AG (1 μm) was the highest among those of the various cannabinoid receptor ligands examined in the present study. 2-AG ether (1 μm), a metabolically stable ether-linked analog of 2-AG, exhibited appreciable migration-inducing activity, although its activity was much lower than that of 2-AG. CP55940 (1 μm) and WIN55212–2 (1 μm) were also found to possess weak activities. However, anandamide (1 μm) was almost totally inactive. The activities of the various species of the 2-monoacylglycerols to induce migration were next compared (Fig. 6). The highest activity was observed with 2-AG (1 μm). Appreciable activities were also observed with 2-eicosa-5′,8′,11′-trienoylglycerol (1 μm) and 2-eicosa-5′,8′,11′,14′,17′-pentaenoylglycerol (1 μm). However, the activities of the other species such as 2-palmitoylglycerol, 2-oleoylglycerol, 2-linoleoylglycerol, and 2-docosa-4′,7′,10′,13′,16′,19′-hexaenoylglycerol were almost negligible. We then examined whether the 2-AG-induced migration is because of chemotaxis (the directional movement along a concentration gradient) or chemokinesis (stimulated movement in no specific direction). The migration of the cells from the upper compartment to the lower compartment in the absence of 2-AG was 4.4% (Fig. 7A). The proportion of migrated cells was elevated to 21.5% when 2-AG (1 μm) was added to the lower compartment. The migration was slightly reduced when 2-AG (1 μm) was added to both the upper compartment (with cells) and the lower compartment (18.5%). On the other hand, the presence of 2-AG (1 μm) in the upper compartment alone (with cells) did not evoke cell migration (5.2%). Because 2-AG is known to be rapidly metabolized by a variety of cells (10Sugiura T. Kobayashi Y. Oka S. Waku K. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 173-192Google Scholar, 13Sugiura T. Waku K. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 89-106Google Scholar), we examined whether exogenously added 2-AG exists as an intact molecule following the co-incubation with the cells. We found that more than 99% of the exogenously added 2-AG (1 μm) was metabolized within 30 min of incubation. Thus, it is rather difficult to determine whether the migration is because of chemotaxis or chemokinesis under the present experimental conditions using 2-AG as a stimulant. To settle this problem, we added 2-AG ether, a metabolically stable analog of 2-AG, instead of 2-AG (Fig. 7B). We found that the percentage of migrated cells when 2-AG ether (1 μm) was added to both the upper compartment (with cells) and the lower compartment (5.8%) was significantly lower than that observed when 2-AG ether (1 μm) was added only to the lower compartment (8.3%), the proportion of migrated cells in the former case being close to the level of the control (4.6%). We also found that the addition of 2-AG ether (1 μm) to the upper compartment alone (with cells) did not enhance the migration of cells from the upper compartment to the lower compartment (4.9%). These results strongly suggest that 2-AG ether elicited mainly chemotaxis rather than chemokinesis. We next investigated whether 2-AG induces the migration of other types of macrophage-like cells. In this study, we employed two types of human monocytic leukemic cells, U937 cells and THP-1 cells, which were differentiated by treatment with 1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3 before use as in the case of the HL-60 cells. We found that 2-AG (1 μm) significantly enhanced the migration of the differentiated U937 cells and THP-1 cells (Fig. 8), although the magnitude of augmentation was rather small compared with the case of the differentiated HL-60 cells. Finally, we examined whether human peripheral blood monocytes respond to 2-AG. As shown in Fig. 9, 2-AG (1 μm) markedly accelerated the migration of human monocytes. The effect of 2-AG was abolished by treatment of the cells with SR144528 (1 μm), a CB2 receptor-specific antagonist, as in the case of differentiated HL-60 cells. The cannabinoid CB2 receptor is a seven transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor and is expressed abundantly in various types of inflammatory cells and immune competent cells such as macrophages, natural killer cells, and B lymphocytes (32Berdyshev E.V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 169-190Google Scholar, 33Parolaro D. Massi P. Rubino T. Monti E. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 319-332Google Scholar, 34Cabral G.A. Onaivi E.S. Biology of Marijuana. Taylor & Francis, London2002: 282-307Google Scholar). Previously (16Sugiura T. Kondo S. Kishimoto S. Miyashita T. Nakane S. Kodaka T. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 605-612Google Scholar), we examined in detail the structure-activity relationship of a number of CB2 receptor ligands using HL-60 cells, which express the CB2 receptor and exhibit a Ca2+ response when challenged with the CB2 receptor ligands. We found that the structure of 2-AG is strictly recognized by the CB2 receptor (16Sugiura T. Kondo S. Kishimoto S. Miyashita T. Nakane S. Kodaka T. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 605-612Google Scholar). The agonistic activity of 2-AG was most potent among various structural analogs. Noticeably, 2-AG acted as a full agonist at the CB2 receptor whereas anandamide acted as a weak partial agonist. Gonsiorek et al. (18Gonsiorek W. Lunn C. Fan X. Narula S. Lundell D. Hipkin R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1045-1050Google Scholar) also demonstrated that 2-AG is a full agonist, and anandamide is a partial agonist using the membrane fraction of Sf9 cells transfected with the human CB2 receptor cDNA. We proposed that 2-AG, but not anandamide, is the intrinsic natural ligand for the cannabinoid CB2 receptor, and the CB2 receptor is primarily a 2-AG receptor (16Sugiura T. Kondo S. Kishimoto S. Miyashita T. Nakane S. Kodaka T. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 605-612Google Scholar). Not much information is currently available concerning the biological activities of 2-AG toward inflammatory cells and immune competent cells. Previously, Kaminski and co-workers (35Lee M. Yang K.H. Kaminski N.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 529-536Google Scholar) reported that 2-AG affects lymphocyte proliferation. They also demonstrated that 2-AG suppresses the interleukin 2 gene expression in murine T lymphocytes through down-regulation of the nuclear factor (36Ouyang Y. Hwang S.G. Han S.H. Kaminski N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 676-683Google Scholar). In addition, Chang et al. (37Chang Y.H. Lee S.T. Lin W.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 715-723Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that 2-AG inhibited the production of interleukin 6 in J774 macrophage-like cells. It remains unclear, however, whether these effects of 2-AG are mediated through the cannabinoid receptor. Recently, we found that 2-AG induces rapid phosphorylation and activation of the p42/44 MAP kinase in HL-60 cells (38Kobayashi Y. Arai S. Waku K. Sugiura T. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 665-669Google Scholar). 2-AG-induced activation of the p42/44 MAP kinase was abolished when the cells were pretreated with either SR144528 or PTX, indicating that the response was mediated through the CB2 receptor and Gi/Go. We also found that rapid phosphorylation of the p38 MAP kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase takes place in 2-AG-stimulated HL-60 cells. 2T. Sugiura and Y. Kobayashi, unpublished results. The 2-AG-induced activation of the p38 MAP kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase has also been reported by several investigators (39Derkinderen P. Ledent C. Parmentier M. Girault J.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 957-960Google Scholar, 40Rueda D. Galve-Roperh I. Haro A. Guzman M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 814-820Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that 2-AG plays some essential role in the inflammation and immune responses, although the exact physiological functions of 2-AG in inflammatory cells and immune competent cells still remain unclear. In this study, we explored the effect of 2-AG on the motility of HL-60 cells. We found that 2-AG induces the migration of HL-60 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells (see Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Similar effects were observed with other macrophage-like cells of human origin such as U937 cells and THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes (see Figs. 8 and 9), suggesting that 2-AG-induced migration is a common event in human macrophages/monocytes. The 2-AG-induced migration of differentiated HL-60 cells was markedly reduced when the cells were pretreated with either SR144528 or PTX (Fig. 3), suggesting that the migration was mediated through the CB2 receptor and Gi/Go. Arachidonic acid and its metabolites did not participate in the 2-AG-induced migration, because free arachidonic acid was not capable of inducing the migration (data not shown). This was also confirmed by the fact that 2-AG ether was able to induce the migration (Fig. 5), although its activity was rather weak compared with that of 2-AG. On the other hand, the Rho kinase, MEK and p38 MAP kinase, were suggested to be involved in the 2-AG-induced migration of differentiated HL-60 cells, because Y-27632 (a Rho kinase inhibitor), PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor), and SB203580 (a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor) suppressed the migration (Fig. 4). The inhibition of cell migration by Y-27632 (1–100 μm) (41Adachi T. Vita R. Sannohe S. Stafford S. Alam R. Kayaba H. Chiara J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4609-4615Google Scholar, 42Ashida N. Arai H. Yamasaki M. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16555-16560Google Scholar), PD98059 (10–20 μm) (43Kampen G.T. Stafford S. Adachi T. Jinquan T. Quan S. Grant J.A. Skov P.S. Poulsen L.K. Alam R. Blood. 2000; 95: 1911-1917Google Scholar, 44Grimshaw M.J. Wilson J.L. Balkwill F.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2393-2400Google Scholar, 45Boehme S.A. Sullivan S.K. Crowe P.D. Santos M. Conlon P.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16555-16560Google Scholar, 46Heuertz R.M. Tricomi S.M. Ezekiel U.R. Webster R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17968-17974Google Scholar) has already been reported for several types of cells stimulated with various chemoattractants, although there are conflicting results as to the inhibition by PD98059 (42Ashida N. Arai H. Yamasaki M. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16555-16560Google Scholar, 46Heuertz R.M. Tricomi S.M. Ezekiel U.R. Webster R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17968-17974Google Scholar). The relationship between Rho kinase and p38 MAP kinase, as well as MEK, is known to be complicated. Ashida et al. (42Ashida N. Arai H. Yamasaki M. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16555-16560Google Scholar) reported that Rho kinase is upstream of p38 MAP kinase in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-stimulated THP-1 cells. Details of the intracellular signaling pathways for 2-AG-induced migration of HL-60 cells will be clarified in the future. The activity of 2-AG was highest among those of the various cannabinoid receptor ligands (Fig. 5). This is reasonable in view of the fact that 2-AG is the true endogenous ligand of the cannabinoid CB2 receptor. It has already been shown that 2-AG is present in appreciable amounts in various mammalian tissues (10Sugiura T. Kobayashi Y. Oka S. Waku K. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 173-192Google Scholar, 13Sugiura T. Waku K. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 89-106Google Scholar). 2-Monoacylglycerols containing saturated, monoenoic, dienoic, and hexaenoic fatty acids did not exhibit any appreciable activity, whereas 2-eicosa-5′,8′,11′-trienoylglycerol and 2-eicosa-5′,8′,11′,14′,17′-pentaenoylglycerol induced the migration to some extent (Fig. 6). These results are in general agreement with the results of the Ca2+ transient experiments reported previously (16Sugiura T. Kondo S. Kishimoto S. Miyashita T. Nakane S. Kodaka T. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 605-612Google Scholar). We have found that the presence of the double bond at the Δ5-position is important for some characteristic conformation of the agonistic molecules (15Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Nakane S. Miyashita T. Kondo S. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. Seki C. Baba N. Ishima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2794-2801Google Scholar, 16Sugiura T. Kondo S. Kishimoto S. Miyashita T. Nakane S. Kodaka T. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 605-612Google Scholar). The migration of HL-60 cells induced by 2-AG was assumed to mainly involve chemotaxis rather than chemokinesis, because 2-AG ether elicited mainly chemotaxis (Fig. 7). This was also confirmed by the fact that the migration of HL-60 cells observed in the presence of 2-AG in both the upper and lower compartments was markedly reduced compared with the case of the presence of 2-AG only in the lower compartment, when 0.5 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate, a monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor, was added to block the hydrolysis of 2-AG: 9.3 + 0.4, 26.7 + 2.1, and 19.5 + 3.3% for vehicle alone, 2-AG present only in the lower compartment, and 2-AG present in both compartments, respectively (the means ± S.D. of four determinations). 3S. Kishimoto, M. Gokoh, and T. Sugiura, unpublished results. We confirmed that 2-AG was rapidly metabolized during the co-incubation with the cells when the monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor was not included in the incubation mixture as mentioned before. It cannot be ruled out, however, that some part of the migration induced by 2-AG was because of chemokinesis. Whatever the mode and the mechanism of action, the fact that 2-AG induces the migration of macrophage-like cells and monocytes is quite noticeable, because various types of proinflammatory molecules are known to induce the migration and recruitment of inflammatory cells. Very recently, Jorda et al. (47Jorda M.A. Verbakel S.E. Valk P.J. Vankan-Berkhoudt V. Maccarrone M. Finazzi-Agro A. Lowenberg B. Delwel R. Blood. 2002; 99: 2786-2793Google Scholar) also demonstrated that 2-AG induces the migration of mouse splenocytes and myeloid cells, yet the elucidation of the detailed mechanism of 2-AG-induced migration of these cells awaits further investigations. Previously, Gallily et al. (48Gallily R. Breuer A. Mechoulam R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 406: R5-R7Google Scholar) reported that 2-AG suppresses the production of tumor necrosis factor α in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse macrophages in vitro and in lipopolysaccharide-administered mice in vivo, although whether these effects of 2-AG are mediated through the CB2 receptor is uncertain. On the other hand, we found that the addition of 2-AG to HL-60 cells enhanced the production of chemokines such as interleukin 8 and MCP-1 through a CB2 receptor- and Gi/Go-dependent mechanism. 4S. Kishimoto and T. Sugiura, unpublished results. Based on the results of a previous investigation on chemokine production and the present study on cell migration, we assume that 2-AG acts as a stimulator or accelerator, rather than as a suppressor, of inflammation reactions and immune responses. As for Δ9-THC, it has been reported that Δ9-THC suppresses inflammation and immune responses in vivo (32Berdyshev E.V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 169-190Google Scholar, 33Parolaro D. Massi P. Rubino T. Monti E. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 319-332Google Scholar, 34Cabral G.A. Onaivi E.S. Biology of Marijuana. Taylor & Francis, London2002: 282-307Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Δ9-THC suppresses the inflammatory reactions and immune response has long remained obscure. Previously, we demonstrated that Δ9-THC is a weak partial agonist of the cannabinoid CB2 receptor (16Sugiura T. Kondo S. Kishimoto S. Miyashita T. Nakane S. Kodaka T. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 605-612Google Scholar). Bayewitch et al. (49Bayewitch M. Rhee M.H. Avidor-Reiss T. Breuer A. Mechoulam R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9902-9905Google Scholar) also reported that Δ9-THC acted as an antagonist toward the CB2 receptor. Noticeably, SR144528 and JTE-907, CB2 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists, inhibited inflammation in vivo (50Iwamura H. Suzuki H. Ueda Y. Kaya T. Inaba T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 420-425Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that Δ9-THC blocks the action of the endogenous natural ligand of the CB2 receptor, that is, 2-AG, thereby inducing the suppression of inflammatory reactions and immune responses. In conclusion, we found that 2-AG induces the migration of HL-60 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells through the CB2 receptor-, Gi/Go-, and several other signaling molecule-dependent mechanisms. Similar effects were observed with other macrophage-like cells and human monocytes. The migration induced by 2-AG was mainly attributed to chemotaxis rather than chemokinesis. 2-AG is known to be generated from stimulated inflammatory cells and immune competent cells such as macrophages upon stimulation (20Bisogno T. Sepe N. Melck D. Maurelli S. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 671-677Google Scholar, 23Varga K. Wagner J.A. Bridgen D.T. Kunos G.

Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2171-2178Google Scholar) through an increased phospholipid metabolism such as inositol phospholipid turnover. It is possible that 2-AG, derived from a variety of stimulated tissues and cells, plays physiologically and pathophysiologically essential roles during the course of inflammatory reactions and immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2083422332,"Smoking is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic diseases. However, the impact of cigarette smoke exposure on neovascularization that develops in response to tissue ischemia is unknown. Here we demonstrate that cigarette smoke extracts inhibit hypoxia-induced in vitro angiogenesis (matrigel assay) in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells. In vivo, mice exposed to cigarette smoke (MES) were shown to have a significant impairment of angiogenesis following surgically induced hindlimb ischemia. The reduced angiogenic response in MES was documented by Laser Doppler flow perfusion studies and capillary density analyses in ischemic hindlimbs. Inhibition of angiogenesis by cigarette smoke in vitro and in vivo was associated with a reduced expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in hypoxic conditions. Administration of an adenoviral vector encoding for HIF-1alpha/VP16, a hybrid transcription factor that is stable in hypoxic and normoxic conditions, restored VEGF expression and completely reversed the cigarette smoke inhibition of angiogenesis in hypoxic conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that cigarette smoke exposure impairs angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF through decreased expression of HIF-1alpha in hypoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1857746659,"Following injury or infection, the liver releases acute-phase proteins (APP). After a severe focal injury, this systemic response can be excessive and may lead to multiorgan dysfunction (MODS). CINC-1 is a neutrophil chemoattractant, and we have now established that it also functions as an early APP after injury to the brain or to peripheral tissues. After induction of a focal inflammatory lesion in the brain, there is rapid hepatic and serum CINC-1 induction, which is associated with increases in neutrophil numbers within the liver and within the circulation. CINC-1-mediated recruitment of neutrophils to organs distant from the primary injury site may contribute to MODS. Indeed, we found that enzyme markers of liver tissue injury are increased in the serum following generation of a focal inflammatory lesion in the brain. Neutralization of CINC-1 in the periphery reversed brain-injury-induced neutrophil mobilization and inhibited recruitment of neutrophils to the brain and to the liver. Thus, a significant component of the hepatic acute-phase response is the release of chemokines by the liver, which act to amplify the inflammatory response and modulate the subsequent leukocytosis and secondary tissue damage. Hepatic CINC-1 synthesis following injury presents a novel focus for treatment of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2093925187,"Rad9, a key component of genotoxin-activated checkpoint signaling pathways, associates with Hus1 and Rad1 in a heterotrimeric complex (the 9-1-1 complex). Rad9 is inducibly and constitutively phosphorylated. However, the role of Rad9 phosphorylation is unknown. Here we identified nine phosphorylation sites, all of which lie in the carboxyl-terminal 119-amino acid Rad9 tail and examined the role of phosphorylation in genotoxin-triggered checkpoint activation. Rad9 mutants lacking a Ser-272 phosphorylation site, which is phosphorylated in response to genotoxins, had no effect on survival or checkpoint activation in Mrad9–/– mouse ES cells treated with hydroxyurea (HU), ionizing radiation (IR), or ultraviolet radiation (UV). In contrast, additional Rad9 tail phosphorylation sites were essential for Chk1 activation following HU, IR, and UV treatment. Consistent with a role for Chk1 in S-phase arrest, HU- and UV-induced S-phase arrest was abrogated in the Rad9 phosphorylation mutants. In contrast, however, Rad9 did not play a role in IR-induced S-phase arrest. Clonogenic assays revealed that cells expressing a Rad9 mutant lacking phosphorylation sites were as sensitive as Rad9–/– cells to UV and HU. Although Rad9 contributed to survival of IR-treated cells, the identified phosphorylation sites only minimally contributed to survival following IR treatment.

Cells respond to genotoxic stress by activating checkpoint signaling pathways that delay cell cycle progression, providing time to repair DNA damage, activate transcriptional responses and, if the damage is too severe, induce apoptotic pathways (1Lowndes N.F.

ATM and ATR are central components of the checkpoint signaling pathways (7Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar). ATM and ATR are activated by genotoxins and phosphorylate downstream signaling proteins, including Chk1 and Chk2, two protein kinases that phosphorylate proteins that regulate checkpoint responses (8Bartek J.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Google Scholar, 23Tsurimoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 23-39Google Scholar). Loading of PCNA is carried out by the clamp loader replication factor C (p140-RFC), a heteropentameric complex consisting of 1 large subunit (p140) and four small subunits (24Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Google Scholar). The 9-1-1 complex also interacts with a putative clamp loader, the Rad17-RFC complex (25Rauen M. Burtelow M.A. Dufault V.M. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29767-29771Google Scholar, 26Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18340-18346Google Scholar), which is composed of Rad17, an RFC-like protein, and the four small RFC subunits (15Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Bermudez V.P. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl.

In vitro, recombinant Rad17-RFC complex loads the 9-1-1 complex onto DNA (27Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Cesare A.J. Maniwa Y. Griffith J.D. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1633-1638Google Scholar), and in intact cells, multiple genotoxins induce the association of the 9-1-1 clamp with chromatin (28Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Google Scholar) in a process that requires Rad17 (12Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations support a model in which the Rad17-RFC clamp loader is a DNA damage sensor that loads the 9-1-1 clamp onto sites of DNA damage in the checkpoint signaling pathway (1Lowndes N.F. Murguia J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 17-25Google Scholar, 3Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Google Scholar, 29Venclovas C. Thelen M.P.

Recent studies demonstrated that ATR and the 9-1-1 complex collaboratively induce Chk1 activation. In both humans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the 9-1-1 complex associates with chromatin in a PIKK-independent manner following DNA damage (12Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar, 31Melo J.A. Cohen J. Toczyski D.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2809-2821Google Scholar, 32Kondo T. Wakayama T. Naiki T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Science. 2001; 294: 867-870Google Scholar). Likewise, ATR forms foci in the absence of Rad17 (12Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the 9-1-1 complex and ATR associate with DNA lesions independently of one another. Nonetheless, both the 9-1-1 complex and ATR are required for Chk1 activation (11Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Google Scholar, 12Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar, 13Weiss R.S. Matsuoka S. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 73-77Google Scholar, 33Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Google Scholar), suggesting that these chromatin-bound complexes coordinately transduce a Chk1-activating signal in response to genotoxins; it remains unclear, however, how these protein complexes are regulated or how they cooperatively couple with the downstream signaling pathways. One possible 9-1-1 regulatory mechanism is phosphorylation. Both Rad9 and Rad1 are phosphorylated in response to DNA damage (28Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Google Scholar, 34Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Google Scholar, 35St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol.

Because Rad9 binds DNA in the absence of ATR and pharmacologic inhibition of PIKKs does not affect Rad9 chromatin binding, it is unlikely that Rad9 phosphorylation regulates 9-1-1 chromatin binding (12Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar, 39Roos-Mattjus P. Vroman B.T. Burtelow M.A. Rauen M. Eapen A.K. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43809-43812Google Scholar). Instead, phosphorylation of 9-1-1 complex members may regulate downstream signals that are activated by the clamp complex. In the present study we examined the role of Rad9 phosphorylation in checkpoint signaling. We identified 9 phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl-terminal 119-amino acid Rad9 tail, which extends beyond the amino-terminal PCNA homology domains and is not required for interaction with Hus1 and Rad1 (14Burtelow M.A. Roos-Mattjus P.M. Rauen M. Babendure J.R. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25903-25909Google Scholar, 40Hirai I. Wang H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25722-25727Google Scholar). One of the sites we found was the previously identified Rad9 damage-inducible phosphorylation site Ser-272. We assessed the effects of Rad9 phosphorylation by expressing Rad9 mutants in Mrad9–/– embryonic stem (ES). These studies showed that cells expressing a Rad9 mutant in which Ser-272 was converted to Ala were indistinguishable from cells expressing wild-type Rad9. In contrast, the remaining Rad9 phosphorylation sites were essential for some but not all Rad9-dependent cellular responses. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the phospho-Rad9 tail plays a critical role in the transduction of downstream checkpoint signals. Antibodies—Antibodies generated to human Rad9 (monoclonal and polyclonal), Rad1 (polyclonal), Hus1 (monoclonal), and Rad17 (polyclonal) have been described previously (28Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Google Scholar, 34Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Google Scholar). Phospho-Chk1 (P-Ser-345) and Chk1 (G-4) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively, and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-Chk2 antibodies (41Ward I.M. Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Google Scholar) were a generous gift from J. Chen, (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) and anti-phospho-Rad9 (P-Ser-272) antibodies (37Chen M.J. Lin Y.T. Lieberman H.B. Chen G. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16580-16586Google Scholar) were a generous gift from E. Lee (University of Texas, San Antonio Texas). The p53 antibody (CM5) was purchased from Novocastra Laboratories, Ltd. (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The JNK1 (C-17) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Culture and Cell Transfection—Human K562 erythroleukemia cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). K562 cells (1 × 107) were transiently transfected as previously described (34Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Google Scholar). Mouse ES cells were maintained on gelatinized tissue culture plates in knock-out DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 15% ES cell-qualified fetal bovine serum (Cell & Molecular Technologies, Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ), 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10–4m 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and 103 units/ml ES-GRO (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2. ES cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Stable clones were selected in medium containing G418 (0.2 mg/ml) and characterized for expression levels by immunoblotting. Two independent clones of each mutant expressing similar levels of protein were used for further studies. Derivation of Mrad9–/–ES Cells—The Mrad9–/– ES cells were originally created and characterized by Kevin M. Hopkins, Wojtek Auerbach, Xiang Yuan Wang, M. Prakash Hande, Haiying Hang, Debra J. Wolgemuth, Alexandra L. Joyner, and Howard B. Lieberman. Briefly, mouse ES cells were electroporated with a targeting vector (Mrad9neo/loxP) that, when integrated into the MRad9 locus, inserts loxP sites in the 5′-untranslated region and in the second intron. Following selection in 200 μg/ml G418 and gancyclovir to enrich for homologous targeting events, Southern blots and PCR were used to identify clones in which a single Mrad9 allele was targeted. One Mrad9neo/loxP ES cell line was cultured in 300 μg/ml G418 to select for cells that targeted the second Mrad9 allele, and a cell line with two targeted MRad9 alleles was identified by Southern blotting and PCR analyses. To delete the first and second Mrad9 exons via Cre-mediated recombination (42Duyao M.P. Auerbach A.B. Ryan A. Perischetti F. Barnes G.T. McNeil S.M. Ge P. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Joyner A.L. MacDonald M.E. Science. 1995; 269: 407-410Google Scholar), the cells were transiently transfected with an HS-cre expression vector (43Dietrich P. Dragatsis I. Xuan S. Zeitlin S. Efstradiadis A. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 196-205Google Scholar) and pPur (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and selected in puromycin. The clones were then examined by Southern blotting and PCR analyses to identify one in which the first and second exons of both Mrad9 alleles were deleted. Drug and Radiation Treatments—Hydroxyurea (Sigma) was prepared fresh in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were irradiated with a 137Cs source at a dose rate of ∼10 Gy/min (Mark I, JL Shepherd and Associates, San Fernando, CA). For UV treatment, cells were washed with PBS to remove medium. Residual PBS was removed prior to irradiation with a UV-C irradiator (Spectrolinker XL-1000, Spectronics Corp., Westbury, NY). Fresh, warmed medium (37 °C) was added after UV irradiation. Cell Extract Preparation and Analysis of Rad9 Chromatin Binding—To analyze protein expression levels, cells were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 30 mm Na4P207, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, containing freshly added 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 20 nm microcystin-LR for 10 min at 4 °C. For protein-protein interaction studies, cells were lysed in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, (supplemented with 100 μg/ml digitonin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 nm microcystin-LR, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) for 10 min at 4 °C. All lysates were either immunoprecipitated as indicated or boiled with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and immunoblotted as described (34Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Google Scholar). Fractionation of the 9-1-1 complex into released and chromatin-bound fractions was done as described previously (28Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Google Scholar). Rad9 Expression Vectors and Rad9 Mutagenesis—S-tag-Rad9-pIRES2-EGFP was generated by adding an in-frame S-tag™ (Novagen Inc.) to the amino terminus of human Rad9 using a PCR strategy. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pIRES2-EGFP (BD Sciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using XhoI and BamHI. To generate stable ES cells expressing wild-type and mutant Rad9s, untagged human Rad9 was cloned into pIRES2-EGFP. Human Rad9 phosphodeficient mutants were generated by mutating the mapped phosphorylation sites using either the GeneEditor kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions or by sequence-overlap extension (44Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535Google Scholar). All mutants were sequenced to confirm mutations. Purification of S-tagged Rad9 —A total of 2 × 109 K562 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with S-tag-Rad9-pIRES2-EGFP (50 pooled transfections). For Edman radiosequencing analysis, cells were recovered by centrifugation 24 h after transfection, washed twice with phosphate-free media (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH), and resuspended in 80 ml of phosphate-free media containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Cells were cultured an additional 2 h, harvested, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 (containing freshly added 100 μg/ml digitonin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 nm microcystin-LR, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) for 10 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was added to S-protein agarose beads (Novagen Inc.), and urea was added to a final concentration of 2 m. The mixture was incubated with rotation for2hat 4 °C. The beads were washed with cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1% Triton-X100, 10 mm NaF, 30 mm NaP2O7, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 2 m urea, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. Proteins were released from the beads by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the slowest migrating (most highly phosphorylated) Rad9 band was excised. Radiosequencing of Rad9 —To identify the amino acid sequence of the radiolabeled peptides, the Coomassie Blue-stained band corresponding to fully phosphorylated, radiolabeled Rad9 was excised from the gel and cut into pieces no larger than 2 mm. Prior to digestion, the gel pieces were destained until clear, then reduced with dithiothreitol, and alkylated with iodoacetamide. In situ enzymatic digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C with modified sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega). Peptides were extracted from the gel, and a portion of the sample was separated on an Applied Biosystems 173A Microblotter Capillary HPLC System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a 0.5 × 150-mm C18 column with an acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluting peptides were spotted directly onto a strip of polyvinylidinedifluoride membrane. The strip was exposed to film to identify 32P-labeled peptides. Spots containing 32P-labeled peptides were excised, treated with Biobrene in methanol, and applied to either an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 HT or the Procise cLC Protein Sequencing System and run using pulsed liquid chemistry. These data were analyzed with the ABI Model 610A data analysis software (Applied Biosystems). To identify the positions of 32P-labeled amino acids within the radioactive peptides, the remainder of the sample was separated on the capillary HPLC exactly as described above. However, the radiolabeled fractions were instead collected manually and covalently bound to aryl amine-derivatized polyvinylidinedifluoride disks using the Sequelon-AA kit (Applied Biosystems), following the suggested instructions. The disks were chromatographed on an Applied Biosystem's Procise cLC modified to collect the derivatized amino acids released by each cycle directly into a 96-well microtiter plate. The extraction solvent of 90% MeOH/10% water/0.01% H3PO4 was substituted for n-butyl chloride in the S3 bottle on the sequencer. Each sequencer fraction, representing one Edman degradation cycle, was spotted onto a custom-made polystyrene plate and dried. The plate containing the released amino acids was counted either by direct counting using a Packard Matrix 96 counter (Packard Biosciences, Boston, MA) or by exposing the plate to a phosphor screen that was scanned with a Storm Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ). Nano-scale Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (nLC/MS) and Tandem Mass Spectrometry (nLC/MS/MS) of Rad9 —For mass spectrometric analysis, S-tag-Rad9 was purified as described above with the exception that the cells were not labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. After S-protein purification, one portion of the sample was left untreated, and the other portion was treated with λ-protein phosphatase according to the manufacturer's instruction (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The proteins were released from the beads by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands corresponding to dephosphorylated and fully phosphorylated Rad9 were excised. Gel slices containing phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Rad9 were destained, reduced with dithiothreitol, and alkylated with iodoacetamide. The gel was dried under vacuum and rehydrated in buffer containing 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 0.2 mg/ml Zwittergent 3–16 and 40 ng/ml porcine trypsin (Promega) for 20 min. The gel slice was rinsed in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The next day the sample was sonicated, acidified with 10% trifluoroacetic acid, and sonicated again. nLC/MS and nLC/MS/MS measurements were performed on aliquots of the tryptic digest using a Micromass Q-Tof-II mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Reversed-phase nLC separations were performed on a 75-μm i.d. × 5-cm long PicoFit column packed with Aquasil C18 stationary phase (NewObjective, Inc., Cambridge, MA). Mobile phase A consisted of water/acetonitrile/n-propanol (98:1:1) containing 0.2% formic acid. Mobile phase B consisted of acetonitrile/n-propyl alcohol/water (80:10:10) containing 0.2% formic acid. A linear gradient from 0–50% B over 30 min was performed. The liquid chromatography pumping system (Michrom UMA, Michrom BioResources Inc., Auburn, CA) was operated at 50 μl/min and split to a column flow of 0.2 μl/min just prior to the sample introduction valve. Peptides from both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated samples were compared using Mass Lynx software (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Novel peptides were considered putative phosphopeptides if the mass of the tryptic peptide corresponded to the mass of Rad9 tryptic peptide plus 80 mass units per phosphate group. Peptides of the appropriate masses were subjected to MS/MS to identify phosphorylation sites. MS/MS experiments were performed using argon as the collision gas, and the collision energy was determined as a function of mass/charge (m/z) and charge (z). Sites of phosphorylation were determined by a combination of Sequest data base searching (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) and manual spectrum interpretation. S-phase Checkpoint Assay—One day prior to the experiment, 1–2 × 104 cells were plated onto gelatinized 96-well plates. Cells were either left untreated or treated with IR (30 Gy) or UV-irradiated (20 J/m2), and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C following treatment. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (TRA120, Amersham Biosciences) was then added at 2 μCi/well, and the cells were incubated for an additional 20 min. Cells were released by trypsinization and harvested by transferring to glass filters. The filter-bound cells were lysed with distilled water (Skatron semiautomatic harvester, Skatron As., Lier, Norway). Filter-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was calculated as the ratio of treated to control samples. Cell Survival and Clonogenic Assays—Varying numbers of ES cells were plated on gelatinized 60-mm dishes in triplicate and 4 h later treated with the indicated doses of ionizing radiation or HU. HU was washed off with PBS 24 h later, and fresh medium was added. Cells were incubated for 14 days, stained with Coomassie Blue, and colonies were counted. Survival was calculated as the percentage of colonies in the untreated dishes compared with the treated dishes, taking into account the plating efficiency, using the equation: colonies counted/(cells plated)(plating efficiency). For UV survival assays 1–2 × 104 cells were plated onto gelatinized 6-well plates. Plates were washed with PBS 24 h later. After removal of residual PBS, the cells were UV-irradiated (15 J/m2), and fresh media was added. Plates were washed 72 h later and stained with Coomassie Blue. Mapping of Rad9 Phosphorylation Sites—Rad9 is extensively and constitutively phosphorylated even in cells that have not been exposed to exogenous genotoxins (34Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Google Scholar, 35St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Google Scholar, 36St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Google Scholar). Rad9 is further inducibly phosphorylated in response to DNA damage (34Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Google Scholar, 35St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Google Scholar, 36St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3292-3300Google Scholar). Despite the extensive phosphorylation, the role of this Rad9 modification remains unclear. To identify Rad9 phosphorylation sites, we subjected Rad9 tryptic peptides to both Edman radiosequencing and mass spectrometry. To isolate sufficient quantities of Rad9 for these analyses, we transiently overexpressed S-tag-Rad9 in K562 cells. S-tag-Rad9 interacts with Hus1 and Rad1 and is converted to a chromatin-bound form following treatment with ionizing and UV radiation (39Roos-Mattjus P. Vroman B.T. Burtelow M.A. Rauen M. Eapen A.K. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43809-43812Google Scholar). Moreover, S-tag-Rad9 restores Chk1 activation in Rad9-deficient cells (data not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrate that S-tag-Rad9 has biochemical properties similar to endogenous Rad9. Using Edman radiosequencing, we identified four radiolabeled peptides, and within these peptides we identified six phosphorylation sites in S-tag Rad9 (Fig. 1, A and B, Ser-272, Ser-277, Ser-328, Ser-375, Ser-380, and Ser-387). Using mass spectrometry, we identified five phosphorylated sites (Fig. 1, A and B). Two of these sites (Ser-277 and Ser-328) were also identified by radiosequencing. The three additional sites (Ser-336, Ser-341, and Thr-355) were new. All the phosphorylation sites were located within the carboxyl-terminal 119-amino acid Rad9 tail. This portion of Rad9 has no homology with PCNA, is not required for Rad9 to interact with Hus1 and Rad1 (14Burtelow M.A. Roos-Mattjus P.M. Rauen M. Babendure J.R. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25903-25909Google Scholar, 40Hirai I. Wang H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25722-25727Google Scholar), but is involved in nuclear transport of the protein due to the presence of a nuclear localization sequence (40Hirai I. Wang H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25722-25727Google Scholar). Collectively, the radiosequencing and mass spectrometric analyses mapped nine phosphorylation sites. Mutation of all nine sites to alanine blocked the Rad9 mobility shift observed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown and Fig. 2), indicating that these studies identified all the phosphorylation sites responsible for the mobility shift.Fig. 2Characterization of Rad9-expressing mouse ES cell lines.Mrad–/"
https://openalex.org/W1980920593,"The purine anti-metabolite 6-mercaptopurine is one of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of acute childhood leukemia and chronic myelocytic leukemia. Developed in the 1950s, the drug is also being used as a treatment for inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease. The antiproliferative mechanism of action of this drug and other purine anti-metabolites has been demonstrated to be through inhibition of de novo purine synthesis and incorporation into nucleic acids. Despite the extensive clinical use and study of 6-mercaptopurine and other purine analogues, the cellular effects of these compounds remain relatively unknown. More recently, purine anti-metabolites have been shown to function as protein kinase inhibitors and to regulate gene expression. In an attempt to find small molecule regulators of the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1, interestingly, we identified 6-mercaptopurine as a specific activator of this receptor. A detailed analysis of 6-mercaptopurine regulation of Nurr1 demonstrates that 6-mercaptopurine regulates Nurr1 through a region in the amino terminus. This activity can be inhibited by components of the purine biosynthesis pathway. These findings indicate that Nurr1 may play a role in mediating some of the antiproliferative effects of 6-mercaptopurine and potentially implicate Nurr1 as a molecular target for treatment of leukemias. The purine anti-metabolite 6-mercaptopurine is one of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of acute childhood leukemia and chronic myelocytic leukemia. Developed in the 1950s, the drug is also being used as a treatment for inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease. The antiproliferative mechanism of action of this drug and other purine anti-metabolites has been demonstrated to be through inhibition of de novo purine synthesis and incorporation into nucleic acids. Despite the extensive clinical use and study of 6-mercaptopurine and other purine analogues, the cellular effects of these compounds remain relatively unknown. More recently, purine anti-metabolites have been shown to function as protein kinase inhibitors and to regulate gene expression. In an attempt to find small molecule regulators of the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1, interestingly, we identified 6-mercaptopurine as a specific activator of this receptor. A detailed analysis of 6-mercaptopurine regulation of Nurr1 demonstrates that 6-mercaptopurine regulates Nurr1 through a region in the amino terminus. This activity can be inhibited by components of the purine biosynthesis pathway. These findings indicate that Nurr1 may play a role in mediating some of the antiproliferative effects of 6-mercaptopurine and potentially implicate Nurr1 as a molecular target for treatment of leukemias. The Nobel prize-winning work of Elion et al. (1Elion G.B. Burgi E. Hitchings G.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952; 74: 411-414Google Scholar) demonstrated that differences in nucleic acid metabolism between cancerous cells and normal cells or between cells from different organisms led to the design and development of nucleic acid analogs that would effectively and selectively block nucleic acid synthesis in the desired target cells. Among the drugs that emanated from this work are 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), 1The abbreviations used are: 6-MP, 6-mercaptopurine; 6-TG, 6-thioguanine; DBD, DNA binding domain; LBD, ligand-binding domain; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin; 6-MMP, 6-methyl-mercaptopurine; 6-MMPR, 6-methyl-mercaptopurine riboside. 6-thioguanine (6-TG), azathioprine, allopurinol, and acyclovir (2Elion G.B.

These drugs are still in use for the treatment of leukemias (6-MP and 6-TG) and autoimmune disorders and the prevention of organ transplant rejection (azathioprine), gout (allopurinol), and herpes virus infections (acyclovir). Additional nucleic acid anti-metabolites that were developed are effective in bacterial infections and malaria. The clinical efficacy of 6-MP is due in part to antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects resulting primarily from the inhibition of purine biosynthesis at multiple steps and incorporation into nucleic acids as thioguanine nucleotides (2Elion G.B.

More recent work has expanded the function of purine anti-metabolites by demonstrating that compounds such as 6-thioguanine or 6-mercaptopurine can target biological activities outside of the purine biosynthesis pathway including telomerase (5Tendian S.W.

In this study, we have identified, from a high throughput screen, 6-mercaptopurine as a regulator of the transcriptional activity of the orphan nuclear hormone receptor Nurr1. There are three members of the NGFI-B group, including Nurr1 (NR4A2; RNR-1/HZF-3/TINUR/NOT), Nur77 (NR4A1; NGFIB/NAK-1/TR3/N10), and Nor-1 (NR4A3) (11Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Ohkura N. Bandoh S. Hosono T. Yamaguchi K. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 1237-1243Google Scholar, 12Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Google Scholar). The three receptors share extensive homology in the DNA binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) but diverge significantly in the NH2 terminus. Mice lacking the Nurr1 gene have demonstrated a key role for this receptor in regulating the development of midbrain dopaminergic cells and controlling dopamine production through transcriptional regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (13Sakurada K.

Through similar gene targeting experiments, a role for Nor-1 and Nur77 has been established in mediating T cell development through the control of apoptosis (18Cheng L.E. Chan F.K. Cado D. Winoto A.

Additional functions for all three receptors have been identified in the regulation of genes that are part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Among these are the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene (20Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Google Scholar, 21Philips A.

Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 782-793Google Scholar). In order to identify potential small molecule regulators of Nurr1 and the other NGFI-B family members, a high throughput screening assay was developed and run on several compound libraries. The results presented here identify 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) as a positive regulator of Nurr1 transcription activity. These data represent the first indication that 6-MP can regulate the transcriptional activity of a nuclear factor and implicate Nurr1 as a potential mediator of the antiproliferative effects of 6-MP. These results also validate the approach that small molecule compounds can be identified as regulators of orphan nuclear receptors independent of ligand binding. Chemicals—6-Mercaptopurine, 2-mercaptopurine, guanosine, mizoribine, allopurinol, mycophenolic acid, hypoxanthine, 5-iodotubercidin, inosine, adenine, adenosine, 6-methylmercaptopurine, guanine, purine, 6-mercaptopurine-2′-deoxyriboside, 6-mercaptopurine riboside, 2-mercaptopyrimidine, 2-mercaptopyridine, 2-amino-6-mercaptopurine, and 6-mercaptoguanosine were all purchased from Sigma. Tissue Culture and Transfections—CV-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (HyClone), 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen) and plated at 10,000 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (HyClone) and 50 μg/ml gentamycin into 96-well plates 1 day previous to transfecting. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 70 ng of DNA were transfected per well with 0.25 μl of FuGENE6 reagent. For GAL4 plasmid transfections, 20 ng of MH100×4-tk-luciferase, 5 ng of the appropriate pCMX-GAL4-mNurr1 construct, 10 ng of pCMX-βGal, and 35 ng of pCMX as filler were transfected. For transfections using the POMC reporter, 30 ng of POMC×5-tk-luciferase, 2.5 ng of pCMX-mNurr1, 10 ng of pCMX-βGal, and 27.5 ng of pCMX were used. For receptor selectivity assays, pCMX-mNor-1, pCMX-hFXR, pCMX-hRXRα, pCMX-hLXRα, pCMX-hRORα, and pCMX-hERα were used along with the different hormone response elements, POMC×5-tk-luciferase, ECREx7-tk-luciferase, CRBPII×2-tk-luciferase, LXRE×3-tk-luciferase, γ-crystallin-HRE×3-tk-luciferase, and ERE×3-tk-luciferase, respectively. Compounds were added 5 h after transfection at the concentrations indicated in the figures, and the transfection was assayed 18 h later unless otherwise indicated. Cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured using an LJL Analyst plate reader and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. All experiments were carried out a minimum of three times. High Throughput Screening—Compound assay plates were prepared by the addition of 0.5 μl of 1 mm stock solutions to each well of a 384-well plate. T175 flasks containing CV-1 cells were transfected with pCMX-Nurr1 along with POMC×5-tk-luciferase reporter using the FuGENE6 method described above. After 5 h, cells were trypsinized and replated into 384-well assay plates at 5000 cells/well and a final compound concentration of 10 μm. After overnight incubation, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined by luminescence reading on the LJL Analyst plate reader. Data were visualized with the Spotfire software program. Plasmids—pCMX-MH100×4-tk-luciferase, pCMX-βGAL, pCMXNurr1, pCMX-Nur77, pCMX-LXRα, pCMX-FXR, pCMX-RXRα, pCMXERα, and pCMX-RORα were described previously (24Perlmann T. Jansson L.

POMC×5-tk-Luc was generated by inserting five copies of an oligo-nucleotide (below) containing a Nurr homodimer response element (29Maira M. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Google Scholar) in front of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter driving expression of a luciferase gene: POMC NuRE, 5′-AGCTGATCGTGATATTTACCTCCAAATGCCAGATCGTGATATTTACCTCCAAATGCCAGATCGTGATATTTACCTCCAAATGCCA-3′. The mNurr1 fragments, aa 1–261, 1–43, 1–96, 1–152, 1–222, 44–261, 96–262, 152–261, 223–261, and 262–583, were PCR-amplified and cloned to the TOPO vector (Invitrogen). They were sequencing-verified and subcloned to the pCMX-GAL4 vector. pCMX-mNurr1ΔTAB1 was cloned by three-piece ligation of mNurr1-(1–83/84))ΔTAB1 fragment from TOPO-mNurr1-(1–85)ΔTAB1; mNurr1-(83/84–598) fragment from pCMX-mNurr1; and pCMX vector at XhoI/SalI, BspEI, and NheI sites. The mNurr1-(1–85) fragment without TAB1 was PCR-amplified with mNurr1EXF and mNurr1ΔTAB1 primers and cloned to TOPO vector and sequencing-verified. The mNurr1ΔTAB1 primer has TAB1 deletion and a unique BspE1 site before the deletion.

Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Google Scholar, 30Zetterstrom R.H. Solomin L. Mitsiadis T. Olson L. Perlmann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1656-1666Google Scholar, 31Wilson T.E. Mouw A.R. Weaver C.A. Milbrandt J. Parker K.L. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Google Scholar, 32Paulsen R.E. Weaver C.A. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16491-16496Google Scholar). Several Nurr response elements have been described in the literature. The nerve growth factor-inducible response element monomer site (31Wilson T.E. Mouw A.R. Weaver C.A. Milbrandt J. Parker K.L. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Google Scholar) was identified through site selection in yeast, and the POMC homodimer element was identified in the promoter of the POMC gene (29Maira M. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Google Scholar). The full-length Nurr1 was titrated on both the nerve growth factor-inducible response element (three copies) and POMC (five copies) elements, and strong Nurr1-dependent activation of these reporters was observed (Fig. 1, A and B). The Nurr1/POMC×5 assay was chosen for high throughput screening, and the initial screen of Nurr1 was done on an 800-compound prototypic library. The single hit (Fig. 1C) was subsequently identified as 6-MP, a hypoxanthine analog. Compounds that appeared to inhibit the constitutive activity of Nurr1 were tested and shown to be cytotoxic (not shown). Other purine derivatives in the compound library, including thioguanine, adenosine, allopurinol, and azathioprine, did not activate on Nurr1. Additionally, other antineoplastic agents, including busulfan, chlorambucil, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, melphalan, methotrexate, semustine, streptozocin, and thiotepa, did not result in activation of Nurr1. Screening of 340,000 additional compounds did not result in any other hits, highlighting the unique ability and specificity of 6-MP to activate Nurr1. 6-Mercaptopurine Activation Is Specific for Nurr1 and Nor1—The activity of 6-MP on Nurr1 was reconfirmed with resupplied stock of compound and demonstrated to be dose-responsive (Fig. 2A). 6-MP did not activate the reporter alone at the concentrations tested (not shown). Concurrent to the screen with Nurr1, a similar screen was developed for Nor-1. Upon testing of Nor-1 on the compound library, 6-MP was again identified as the sole positive hit. Nor-1 activation by 6-MP is similar in efficacy and potency to Nurr1 (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that 6-MP may regulate all Nurr members, so Nur77/NGFI-B was tested. Unlike Nurr1 and Nor-1, both the rat NGFI-B and human homologue TR3 were minimally activated by 6-MP (not shown). It is unclear if this is due to the much higher basal activity of Nur77/NGFI-B or if the 6-MP effect is limited to Nurr1 and Nor-1. It is possible that other factors may also influence activation of Nur77/NGFIB including cell type and/or reporter context. To establish whether the 6-MP effect was specific, several other nuclear hormone receptors were tested. LXR, FXR, RXR, ERα, and RORα showed no activation by 6-MP up to 50 μm (Fig. 2C). Although not exhaustive, these data suggest that the 6-MP effect on nuclear hormone receptors is limited to Nurr1 and Nor-1. 6-Mercaptopurine Activates Nurr1 through the NH2-terminal AF-1—Since their introduction as chemotherapeutic drugs in the late 1950s, 6-mercaptopurine and other purine anti-metabolites have been extensively studied both in the clinic and in vitro to identify their mechanism of action (see Refs. 2Elion G.B. Science. 1989; 244: 41-47Google Scholar and 3Chabner B.A. Allegra C. armen J. Curt G. regory A. Calabresi P. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Goodman and Gilman's the Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 9th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1996: 1252-1257Google Scholar). There are several pathways in which 6-MP addition to cells may lead to activation of Nurr1, including binding as a ligand, inducing expression of endogenous Nurr1, perturbing purine biosynthesis, inducing apoptosis, or affecting other signal transduction pathways. To test the possibility that 6-MP is working as a ligand for Nurr receptors, constructs were generated with the LBD of Nurr1 and Nor-1 fused to the GAL4 DBD. In co-transfection experiments, these GAL4 fusions were not activated by 6-MP (Fig. 3A). To rule out the possibility that the 6-MP effect was through the LBD but required DNA binding to a hormone response element, GAL4 full-length Nurr1 was generated. The GAL4-Nurr1 was activated efficiently by 6-MP (Fig. 3A), suggesting that binding to the POMC×5 reporter did not contribute to the 6-MP activity. These results also demonstrate that the 6-MP effect is not due to induction of endogenous Nurr1 expression. Previous reports indicated that members of the NGFI-B family of nuclear receptors could be regulated by phosphorylation in the DNA binding domain, which led to an inhibition of DNA binding (33Pekarsky Y. Hallas C. Palamarchuk A. Koval A. Bullrich F. Hirata Y. Bichi R. Letofsky J. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3690-3694Google Scholar, 34Masuyama N. Oishi K. Mori Y. Ueno T. Takahama Y. Gotoh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32799-32805Google Scholar, 35Hirata Y. Whalin M. Ginty D.D. Xing J. Greenberg M.E. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1780-1788Google Scholar, 36Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 953-964Google Scholar). Additional work characterizing these receptors has demonstrated that, like other nuclear hormone receptors, the NH2 terminus contains a constitutive, ligand-independent transcription activation domain (AF1) that may also be a site for potential regulation (32Paulsen R.E. Weaver C.A. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16491-16496Google Scholar, 36Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 953-964Google Scholar). To address the region of Nurr1 that is responsible for 6-MP activation, a series of GAL4-Nurr fusions were generated. The GAL4-Nurr1-(1–598) contains the full-length Nurr1, whereas the other constructs are deletions of the region of Nurr1 that is NH2-terminal to the DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–261). Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of these fusion proteins (not shown). Testing of these constructs demonstrated that 6-MP was activating through the NH2-terminal 261 amino acids (Fig. 3B). Since this region does not contain the DBD of Nurr1, these results rule out regulation of DNA binding or activation of the LBD as the mechanism for the 6-MP effect on Nurr1 and indicate that the AF1 may be the target of 6-MP. Additional analysis of the NH2 terminus with a larger set of GAL4-Nurr1 truncations revealed a minimal region between amino acids 1 and 151 that still retains the ability to respond to 6-MP (Fig. 3B), albeit reduced compared with the larger domain (aa 1–222). The first 40 amino acids appear to be dispensable for activity, since the GAL4-Nurr1-(1–43) is inactive and GAL4-Nurr1-(44–261) is active. To verify that 6-MP activation of Nurr1 is not restricted to CV-1 cells, the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 was transfected with GAL4-Nurr1-(1–222). The 6-MP activation was comparable (Fig. 3C) with that observed in CV-1 cells, supporting the possibility that Nurr1 is a target for 6-MP in human tissues. A sequence comparison of the region 40–151 between Nurr1 and Nor-1 indicates several stretches of conserved amino acid residues (Fig. 3D) and several potential phosphorylation sites. This region is consistent with the boundaries of the AF-1 domain characterized in previous studies and contains the TAB-1 activation region identified as a minimal activation region (32Paulsen R.E. Weaver C.A. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16491-16496Google Scholar). In order to determine whether the TAB-1 was necessary for the 6-MP effect, a deletion mutant lacking TAB-1 was generated (Fig. 3E). Although the basal level of activity of the receptor was diminished, the magnitude of the 6-MP activation was not impaired, indicating the presence of additional novel regulatory regions in the receptor NH2 terminus. In order to demonstrate that this region of Nurr1 was functioning as a substrate for a cell-based activity, co-transfection experiments were done to determine whether the NH2-terminal 261 amino acids could compete with both the constitutive activity of the full-length Nurr1 and 6-MP-activated full-length Nurr1. The ability of GAL4-Nurr1-(1–261) but not GAL4-DBD to significantly inhibit the constitutive activity of full-length Nurr1 (Fig. 3F) indicates that either cellular co-factors or enzyme activities are required for Nurr1 activation through the AF-1. Work from others demonstrating interaction of this region with the p160 co-activator complex supports these results (37Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33001-33011Google Scholar). The inhibition of 6-MP activation of Nurr1 (Fig. 3F) by the GAL4-Nurr1-(1–261) suggests that these factors are potentially sensitive to regulation by components of the purine biosynthetic pathway. Recent work has shown that signal transduction pathways such as protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation can regulate the AF-1 region of Nurr1 (38Kovalovsky D. Refojo D. Liberman A.C. Hochbaum D. Pereda M.P. Coso O.A. Stalla G.K. Holsboer F. Arzt E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1638-1651Google Scholar). Testing with compounds including SB-203580 (mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor), LY-294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor), DRB (protein kinase A inhibitor), PD-98059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor), and staurosporine (protein kinase C inhibitor), has not resulted in effects specific to either the constitutive activity of the Nurr1 NH2 terminus or to the 6-MP activation of this region (not shown). Since protein kinase A has been implicated in regulation of Nurr family members, we further tested two other protein kinase A inhibitors, 4-cyano-3-methylisoquinoline and KT5720, in their ability to influence 6-MP activation of Nurr1. These compounds also had no effect on either the basal activity of Nurr1 or the activation by 6-MP (not shown). Activation of Nurr1 Is Specific to 6-Mercaptopurine and Not Other Compounds with Similar Mechanism of Action—The majority of known functions of 6-MP involve conversion into the active metabolite 6-thio-IMP through the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (39Vogt M.H. Stet E.H. De Abreu R.A. Bokkerink J.P. Lambooy L.H. Trijbels F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 189-194Google Scholar). At this point, the 6-thio-IMP can be utilized in two different pathways. One option is that the 6-thio-IMP can be methylated by thiopurine methyltransferase to 6-Me-thio-IMP, which is a potent inhibitor of de novo purine biosynthesis. The 6-Me-thio-IMP can also be derived from the intermediate 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside, which is converted to 6-Me-thio-IMP by adenosine kinase (39Vogt M.H. Stet E.H. De Abreu R.A. Bokkerink J.P. Lambooy L.H. Trijbels F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 189-194Google Scholar). The other option is that 6-thio-IMP can be metabolized into 6-thioguanosine 5′-monophosphate, which is then incorporated into DNA and RNA as 6-thio-GTP, leading to eventual cell death (40Tidd D.M. Paterson A.R. Cancer Res. 1974; 34: 738-746Google Scholar, 41Hoki H. Mie Medical Journal. 1990; 40: 99-107Google Scholar). To determine whether either of these metabolic pathways were involved in the activation of Nurr1, a number of nucleotide analogs and compounds known to effect purine biosynthesis were tested. As mentioned previously, the compound library that was screened contains several other thiopurine compounds and nucleotides including thioguanine, adenosine, allopurinol, azathioprine, adenosine phosphate, and puromycin. Several of these compounds were resupplied and retested in both the full-length Nurr1 assay and the GAL4-Nurr1 assay. Adenosine, adenine, 6-TG, purine, hypoxanthine, and inosine were inactive on all Nurr1 constructs tested (Fig. 4A). Additional testing of other thiopurine compounds included 6-thioguanosine, 6-mercaptopurine riboside, 6-mercaptopurine deoxyriboside, 6-methyl-mercaptopurine (6-MMP), 6-methyl-mercaptopurine riboside (6-MMPR), and 2-mercaptopurine. Among these, only 6-mercaptopurine riboside and 6-mercaptopurine deoxyriboside were able to activate Nurr1 (Fig. 4B). This activity was also observed when assayed on the full-length receptor on the POMC×5 reporter (Fig. 4C). The inhibitory effects of 6-TG and 6-thioguanosine cannot be interpreted due to nonspecific inhibition of both the POMC×5 reporter as well as the MH100×4 reporter. The finding that 6-MMP and 6-MMPR did not activate Nurr1 suggests that either there is not a sufficient amount of adenosine kinase required to convert these compounds to 6-Me-thio-IMP (39Vogt M.H. Stet E.H. De Abreu R.A. Bokkerink J.P. Lambooy L.H. Trijbels F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 189-194Google Scholar) or 6-MP, 6-MMP, and 6-MMPR inhibit purine de novo biosynthesis through slightly different mechanisms. To address the possibility that adenosine kinase activity is required for activation of Nurr1 by 6-MP, we tested 6-MP in the presence of the adenosine kinase inhibitor 5′-iodotubercidin. The activation of full-length Nurr1 by 6-MP is completely inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by 5′-iodotubercidin (Fig. 4D), suggesting that there is sufficient adenosine kinase activity in the cell to convert 6-MP to an active form and that this conversion is required for activation of Nurr1 by 6-MP. These results were also seen on the GAL4-Nurr1 full-length and GAL4-Nurr1-(1–261) protein (not shown). Based on the known consequence of inhibiting adenosine kinase, there are two possible explanations for why 5′-iodotubercidin might inhibit 6-MP activity. The first is that, if 6-MP is converted to its metabolite 6-methyl-MP-riboside, then adenosine kinase is required for phosphorylation of this substrate to convert it to the 6-Me-IMP active metabolite. The second is that since adenosine kinase is the key enzyme in regulating the conversion of adenosine to AMP, inhibiting this step results in a build up of adenosine, which we have previously shown can inhibit 6-MP activation of Nurr1. This does not provide an explanation for why 6-MMP and 6-MMPR do not activate Nurr1. It is possible that these compounds are not cell-permeable and that exogenous 6-MMP and 6-MMPR may require additional modifications to be active. 6-Mercaptopurine Activation of Nurr1 Can Be Blocked by Replenishing Endogenous Purines—The antiproliferative activity of 6-MP has been shown to result partly from a decrease in the production of adenosine and guanosine synthesis (42Stet E.H. De Abreu R.A. Bokkerink J.P. Lambooy L.H. Vogels-Mentink T.M. Keizer-Garritsen J.J. Trijbels F.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 49-56Google Scholar). To determine if depletion of these nucleotides had any effect on Nurr1, 6-MP was added in the presence of adenine, adenosine, guanine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, or inosine. Of these compounds, adenine, adenosine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, and inosine effectively inhibited the activation of Nurr1 by 6-MP both in the case of the GAL4-Nurr1 constructs (Fig. 4E) as well as full-length Nurr1 on the POMC×5 reporter (not shown). The inability of guanine to inhibit the 6-MP activation may be due either to solubility of the compound or a lack of conversion of guanine to the nucleoside form. These data indicate that the level of adenine, adenosine, or guanosine molecules can specifically affect the activity of Nurr1 through a region in the NH2 terminus. One consequence of reduced adenosine molecules is a reduction in the amount of AMP/ADP/ATP available to carry out cellular functions. This would imply that there exists the possibility of an ATP-dependent pathway that can regulate Nurr1 (and Nor-1) activity and that perturbation of this pathway results in the observed transcriptional activation detected in the presence of 6-MP. Indeed, recent reports suggest that a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A signaling cascade can regulate both Nurr1 expression as well as transcription activity (38Kovalovsky D. Refojo D. Liberman A.C. Hochbaum D. Pereda M.P. Coso O.A. Stalla G.K. Holsboer F. Arzt E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1638-1651Google Scholar). The NGFI-B family of nuclear hormone receptors has been implicated in many physiological processes including regulation of dopamine production, expression of inflammatory hormones, and lymphocyte development (11Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Ohkura N. Bandoh S. Hosono T. Yamaguchi K. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 1237-1243Google Scholar, 12Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Google Scholar). The results presented here establish the purine anti-metabolite 6-mercaptopurine as a small molecule regulator of Nurr1 and Nor-1 transcriptional activity. These findings have significant implications both for understanding Nurr1 receptor function and broadening the potential mechanism of action for 6-MP in treatment of cancer and inflammation. The activity of 6-MP was identified through a high throughput screen using a Nurr1 homodimer response element and full-length receptor. The initial screening result was confirmed on both full-length receptor and a GAL4 fusion, indicating that the 6-MP activity was not a result of influencing DNA binding to the POMC response element or a transcription artifact picked up during screening. Surprisingly, the 6-MP effect was not dependent on the ligand-binding domain, and the minimal response region was mapped to amino acids 40–151 in the NH2 terminus (32Paulsen R.E. Weaver C.A. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16491-16496Google Scholar). Whereas this region has previously been shown to contain a defined activation domain, TAB-1, our results indicate that it is not the target of 6-MP regulation. Testing on other nuclear hormone receptors demonstrates that the effect of 6-MP is selective toward members of the NGFI-B family of proteins. The specificity of the activity is striking when considered in the context of the broad consequences of 6-MP on purine biosynthesis and cell proliferation and further suggests that these receptors may play a distinct role in mediating 6-MP action in vivo. The results demonstrating that other purine anti-metabolites that are similar in structure and function to 6-MP, such as 6-thioguanine, azathioprine, and 6-MMPR, cannot activate Nurr1 support our finding as a novel and unique property of 6-MP. Based on the current understanding of how 6-MP regulates certain cell functions (2Elion G.B. Science. 1989; 244: 41-47Google Scholar, 3Chabner B.A. Allegra C. armen J. Curt G. regory A. Calabresi P. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Goodman and Gilman's the Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 9th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1996: 1252-1257Google Scholar), there are several possibilities to explain the activation of Nurr1 and Nor-1. It has been demonstrated that 6-MP is processed into the active metabolite 6-thioinosine monophosphate through a series of enzyme conversions. The 6-thioinosine monophosphate can exert antiproliferative effects through conversion into thioguanine nucleotides that are incorporated into nucleic acids or through inhibition of the purine de novo biosynthetic pathway as 6-thioinosine monophosphate or a methylated form, Me-6-thioinosine monophosphate. In support of the latter possibility, our findings demonstrating that the addition of adenosine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, and inosine can block the activation of Nurr1 by 6-MP are consistent with previous studies showing that the cytotoxic effects of 6-MP can be reversed or inhibited by replenishing the pool of nucleotides through the addition of adenosine or guanosine (42Stet E.H. De Abreu R.A. Bokkerink J.P. Lambooy L.H. Vogels-Mentink T.M. Keizer-Garritsen J.J. Trijbels F.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 49-56Google Scholar). The activation of Nurr1 in CV-1 cells and other cell lines tested is observed at 10 μm 6-MP and increases with increasing concentrations of 6-MP. The range of concentrations of 6-MP needed to inhibit purine biosynthesis varies greatly from cell to cell, with sensitive cell lines such as the human lymphoblastic Molt F4 requiring 0.5–10 μm and some cell lines being resistant at concentrations above 100 μm. Therefore, whereas more potent derivatives of 6-MP may exist, most biological effects of 6-MP observed to date occur in the micromolar range, and activation of Nurr1 falls within this range. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that the activation of Nurr1 by 6-MP is through the induction of cytotoxicity as a result of incorporation into DNA or RNA and subsequent DNA damage. The transfection efficiency as measured by constitutive expression of a β-galactosidase gene is not affected by the addition of 6-MP. Further, other cytotoxic and antineoplastic compounds tested in the high throughput screen, such as carboplatin, melphalan, methotrexate, and the closely related purine analogs thioguanine and azathioprine, did not activate Nurr1. It is possible, however, that inhibition of DNA or RNA replication induces signaling cascades unique to 6-MP that result in the activation of Nurr1, although the relatively short exposure (overnight) to 6-MP would suggest that this is not the mechanistic pathway. Purine anti-metabolites have also been shown to have other effects in the cell. Most pertinent to the observations presented in this report is the finding that 6-methyl-mercaptopurine riboside and 6-thioguanine are specific and effective inhibitors of protein kinase N, which has been implicated in nerve growth factor signaling (6Volonte C. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 700-708Google Scholar, 7Volonte C. Ross A.H. Greene L.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 71-78Google Scholar). Recent reports also suggest that 6-MMPR can regulate tyrosine kinase signaling in the process of angiogenesis (43Presta M. Rusnati M. Belleri M. Morbidelli L. Ziche M. Ribatti D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2417-2424Google Scholar). The precedent set by these findings suggests that 6-MP may also regulate as yet unidentified activities in the cell that may specifically influence Nurr1 activity. NGFI-B receptors, like many other nuclear hormone receptors, can be regulated through phosphorylation. Regulatory sites have been identified in the DNA binding domain and the NH2 terminus (34Masuyama N. Oishi K. Mori Y. Ueno T. Takahama Y. Gotoh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32799-32805Google Scholar, 35Hirata Y. Whalin M. Ginty D.D. Xing J. Greenberg M.E. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1780-1788Google Scholar, 36Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 953-964Google Scholar, 38Kovalovsky D. Refojo D. Liberman A.C. Hochbaum D. Pereda M.P. Coso O.A. Stalla G.K. Holsboer F. Arzt E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1638-1651Google Scholar). Therefore, one potential mechanism for activation of Nurr1 may be through 6-MP regulation of a kinase or phosphatase that affects phosphorylation within the region of amino acids 44–151. This region is rich in serines, threonines, and tyrosines. Consequences of the phosphorylation state could include interaction with co-factors and also regulation of intramolecular interactions. Recent work indicates that the region identified as responsive to 6-MP regulation is also the site of protein-protein interactions in Nur77 with transcriptional co-activators such as p300 and the p160/steroid receptor coactivator (37Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33001-33011Google Scholar). Whereas Nur77 was not activated by 6-MP in our experiments, it is possible that under other conditions, activation may be seen. It is likely that the effect of 6-mercaptopurine will also depend on such factors as cell proliferation, availability of co-factors, DNA response element, and potentially conditions in which the receptors are overexpressed (i.e. immediate early response signaling or disease states). The ability of 6-MP to regulate the activity of a transcription factor, such as Nurr1 or Nor-1, broadens significantly the possible mechanisms of action of this drug. Members of the NGFI-B family of nuclear receptors are expressed in lymphocytes, various cancer cells, and cells involved in inflammatory diseases, indicating that this group of receptors is present in the tissues targeted by 6-MP (12Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Google Scholar). Whereas many of the steps involved in 6-MP-mediated cytotoxicity have been elucidated, it is possible that these effects can be enhanced or suppressed through secondary targets. Nur77 and Nor-1 have been shown to play a role in mediating apoptosis in T lymphocytes in vivo and numerous cancerous cell lines (18Cheng L.E. Chan F.K. Cado D. Winoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1865-1875Google Scholar, 19Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Google Scholar, 44Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G.

Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Google Scholar). When considering the question of whether regulation of apoptosis by Nur77/Nor-1 is through transcription regulation or other mechanisms, it is interesting to speculate that the effectiveness of 6-MP treatment may be influenced by the levels of these receptors. The primary significance of the findings presented here is that there exists in the cell a signaling pathway that is sensitive to either levels of purine nucleotides or to direct regulation by 6-MP and that this pathway is specific toward the nuclear hormone receptors Nurr1 and Nor-1. The identification of 6-MP as a regulator of Nurr1 transcription introduces this compound as a tool for understanding the nature of the components of this pathway. It is expected that, upon further characterization of this signaling cascade, it should be possible to design pharmacological tools for the selective therapeutic regulation of Nurr1 receptors in treatment of central nervous system disorders including Parkinson's disease and inflammatory disorders. Additionally, the results presented here highlight a novel aspect of the potential mechanism of action of 6-MP, one of the most widely used antileukemic and anti-inflammatory drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2099750780,"The protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis belongs to one of the earliest diverged eukaryotic lineages. This is also reflected in a simple intracellular organization, as Giardia lacks common subcellular compartments such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, and apparently also a Golgi apparatus.

Giardia intestinalis is a flagellated protist of the diplomonad group that commonly causes diarrheal disease throughout the world. All known free-living and parasitic diplomonads share some unique structural features, including the absence of mitochondria, peroxisomes, and a recognizable Golgi apparatus (1Brugerolle G. Protistologica. 1974; 10: 83-90Google Scholar, 2Brugerolle G. Kunstyr I. Senaud J. Friedhoff K.T. Z. Parasitenkd. 1980; 62: 47-61Google Scholar, 3Eyden B.P. Vickerman K. J.

Asexually dividing, motile trophozoite forms of Giardia colonize the upper intestine of vertebrate hosts, and are shed as environmentally resistant, infectious cysts. The intracellular organization of the binucleate trophozoite is unusually simple, also in comparison with other phylogenetically basal groups such as the trichomonads (e.g. Trichomonas vaginalis (9Benchimol M.

Immunoelectron microscopy studies demonstrated the localization of giardial BiP (11Soltys B.J. Falah M. Gupta R.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1909-1917Google Scholar), three protein-disulfide isomerase paralogues (12Knodler L.A. Noiva R. Mehta K. McCaffery J.M. Aley S.B. Svard S.G. Nystul T.G. Reiner D.S.

Parasitol. 1994; 79: 236-249Google Scholar). Other morphologically recognizable membrane compartments are the peripheral vesicles (PVs, approximately 150–200 nm in size), which are thought to perform both lysosomal and endosomal activities (14Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Google Scholar). PVs underlie the plasma membrane of the cell body except at the flagella or where it covers the cytoskeleton structures of the ventral disk (14Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Google Scholar). A third intracellular compartment, encystation-specific vesicles (ESVs) (15Reiner D.S. McCaffery M. Gillin F.D. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 142-153Google Scholar), arises only during the highly orchestrated process of encystation. Formation and maturation of the large ESVs (up to 1 μm diameter) is functionally linked to the regulated expression of exported cargo (i.e. cyst wall proteins), and there is increasing evidence that ESVs may be the cisternae of a unique Golgi equivalent in Giardia (16Hehl A.B. Marti M. Kohler P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1789-1800Google Scholar, 17Lujan H.D. Marotta A. Mowatt M.R. Sciaky N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4612-4618Google Scholar, 18Marti M. Li Y. Schraner E.M. Wild P. Kohler P. Hehl A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1433-1447Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that sorting of exported proteins to the regulated secretory pathway via ESVs or a second constitutively active export pathway to the plasma membrane occurred at or immediately after ER exit (18Marti M. Li Y. Schraner E.M. Wild P. Kohler P. Hehl A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1433-1447Google Scholar). This also argued for the absence of a conventional Golgi apparatus in all developmental stages. Thus, current data suggests the presence of a primordial secretory system in Giardia, but very little is known about its molecular characteristics. Here we report a broad approach to analyze the functional anatomy of this unusual and dynamic membrane system and to investigate its putatively ancestral nature. Specifically, we addressed the question whether the cellular machinery for the generation of the Golgi-like ESV compartments indeed arises de novo during encystation, or whether a functional, or even a morphologically identifiable Golgi equivalent is present in trophozoites that could be used as a template on which encysting cells build ESVs. We established a molecular framework for secretory transport in this ancient eukaryote using a comparative genomics approach and provide evidence for the presence of membrane compartments with Golgi characteristics in trophozoites as well. Despite significant morphological changes, there is little evidence for regulation on a molecular level, indicating that generation of ESVs as a stabilized Golgi equivalent in Giardia is achieved in large part though re-organization of constitutive elements of this secretory system. Cell Culture—Trophozoites of Giardia strains WBC6 (ATCC number 50803) were grown vegetatively in TYI-S-33, supplemented with 10% of adult bovine serum and bovine bile. Cells were in vitro encysted according to the two-step method described by Boucher and Gillin (19Boucher S.E. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by chilling culture tubes on ice for 30 min, inverting 10 times, and collection of cells by centrifugation at 800 × g.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA from 5 × 106 trophozoites or encysting cells (3, 7, 15, and 24 h after induction of encystation) was prepared using the Stratagene total RNA kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following digestion with 30 units of DNase for 15 min at 37 °C. For first strand cDNA synthesis, 3.5 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed with 100 ng of primer k-anchor and 50 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 45 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 μm dNTP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The reaction was incubated at 45 °C for 50 min and heat inactivated at 70 °C followed by digestion with 10 units of RNase H for 20 min at 37 °C. Single-stranded cDNA was purified with the Concert DNA purification spin cartridge system (Invitrogen). Single-stranded cDNA corresponding to 70 ng of total RNA was used as template for semi-quantitative PCR analysis with 8 pmol each of primer k-adaptor and a gene-specific primer. A list of all primers used for RT-PCR and semi-quantitative PCR is available as Supplementary Material. Primer sequences were chosen to amplify fragments between 100 and 500 bp, containing the end of the gene ORF and the complete 3′-untranslated region. Reaction conditions were 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each dNTP, and 1 unit of recombinant Taq polymerase (Sigma). Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: “hot start cycle,” 94 °C for 5 min, 80 °C for 2 min (addition of Taq polymerase), 64 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 22–32 cycles (depending on the copy number of a specific cDNA) at 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.01% SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Data collection was performed on a fluorimager (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) using ChemiImager 5500 software. For all the cDNA products, the log-linear range was between 20 and 30 PCR cycles. Negative controls included: 1) omission of cDNA template in the PCR reaction and 2) omission of enzyme in the RT reaction. Expression and Purification of Bacterial Fusion Proteins—The nucleotide sequences encoding amino acids 10–170 of Giβ′COP, 8–189 of GiSar1p, 430–705 of GiCLH, 25–176 of GiRab11, 97–270 of GiSyn1, as well as 8–201 and 344–714 of GiDLP and 3–111 of GiYip were PCR amplified from genomic DNA and subcloned into the polylinker region of the pMal-2Cx expression vector (New England Biolabs), downstream of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) gene, giving rise to fusion genes MBP-Giβ′COP, MBP-GiSar1p, MBP-GiCLH, MBP-GiRab11, MBP-GiSyn1, MBP-GiDLPn, and MBP-GiDLPc (corresponding to N- and C-terminal fragments of GiDLP, respectively), and MBP-GiYip. Bacterial overexpression of fusion proteins was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for2hat37 °C, and fusion proteins were affinity purified from bacterial cold shock lysates on amylose resin according to manufacturers protocols and lyophilized as previously described (21Hehl A.B. Lekutis C. Grigg M.E. Bradley P.J. Dubremetz J.F. Ortega-Barria E. Boothroyd J.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7078-7086Google Scholar). Primers used for the amplification of marker gene fragments are available as Supplementary Material. Peptide Synthesis—Synthesis of a polypeptide for antibody production was performed by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). A peptide corresponding to Glu-613 through Lys-630 of the GiDLP protein, NH2C-ESVPEKIKAQGPLSEAEK-COOH, was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Production of Polyclonal Antibodies—BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally on days 0, 15, and 30 with ∼50 μg of fusion protein or 10 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and emulsified with an equal volume of RIBI adjuvant (Corixa, Hamilton MT). Blood was collected prior to initial immunization and after each boost from the tail vein, the serum fraction was assayed for specific antibody content. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested as described above, cell pellets were washed once in ice-cold PBS and counted. SDS sample buffer was added to obtain a uniform concentration of 5 × 105 cells per sample, and samples were immediately boiled for 3 min. 10% Polyacrylamide gels were run under reducing conditions with 7.75 mg/ml dithiothreitol in samples, and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane according to standard methods. Antisera were diluted as specified below in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat milk powder. CWP2 was detected with mouse mAb 7D2 (22Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Google Scholar) and diluted 1:20,000. Mouse pAbs raised against Giardia marker proteins GiSar1p, Giβ′COP, GiCLH, GiSyn1, and GiYip1p were diluted 1:1000, and to GiCLH and GiDLP 1:5000. Primary antibodies were detected with a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (both Sigma), respectively, and visualized using the ECL system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Trophozoites and encysting cells were harvested as described above, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, followed by a 5-min incubation with 100 mm glycine in PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min and blocked >1 h in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100% in PBS for 1 h. Mouse polyclonal antibodies have been diluted 1:200 (except GiDLPn and GiCLH, these pAbs were diluted 1:1000), and Texas Red-conjugated mouse mAb A300-TR (Waterborne, New Orleans, LA), an anti-CWP antibody, 1:30. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Sigma). Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Leica DM-IRBE microscope using a ×100 HCX PL Fluotar lens (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and digital images were recorded using a cooled CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) and processed with the Metaview software package (Visitron Systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany). Electron Microscopy—Trophozoites or encysting cells were cultivated as described above. After collection, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and transferred into 6-well plates containing 10–12 sapphire glasses per well in pre-warmed PBS (37 °C). To promote attachment to these 30-μm thick carbon-coated sapphire disks, cells were then incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Sapphire disks covered with a monolayer of attached parasites were subsequently plunged into a mixture of liquid propane/ethane (8/2) cooled by liquid nitrogen using a custom device. The ultra-rapidly frozen samples were substituted at –90 °C in acetone containing 0.5% osmium tetroxide and 0.25% glutaraldehyde (23Wild P. Schraner E.M. Adler H. Humbel B.M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 53: 313-321Google Scholar) overnight. The temperature was then continuously (5 °C/h) raised to 0 °C, and the samples embedded in Epon at 4 °C. After polymerization at 60 °C for 2 days, ultrathin sections were cut parallel to the sapphire surface, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a CM 12 electron microscope (Philips, Netherlands) equipped with a slow scan CCD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Recorded pictures have been processed with the Digital micrograph 3.34 software (Gatan). Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation and Subcellular Fractionation—All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were grown at 37 °C in triple surface flasks (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) to a density of approximately 1 × 109 cells/flask, harvested as described above, and washed once in ice-cold PBS. For quantitative assays (densitometric quantification, biochemical assays), cell numbers of different populations (trophozoites and encysting cells) were normalized after determining the absolute cell number with a Neubauer chamber. The adjusted cell pellet was then resuspended in 4 ml of ice-cold PBS containing a 2× protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μm E-64, 2 μm leupeptin, and 300 nm aprotinin; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This suspension was transferred into a 15-ml Falcon tube (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and processed on a fixed stand with a sonifier (Branson, Danbury, CT) using a total of 5 pulses of 30 s each (setting 2, 10% pulse intensity). Microscopic examination was used to confirm that trophozoites and encysting cells (but not cysts) were completely disintegrated. After adding sucrose to a final concentration of 250 mm, the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g and the supernatant harvested. 1.8 ml of this postnuclear supernatant were layered onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient in 12-ml polyallomer tubes (Beckman-Spinco) made from four 0.5-ml layers of 60, 55, 50, and 45% sucrose and five 1.5-ml layers of 40, 35, 30, 25, and 20% sucrose, which resulted in a total volume of 11.3 ml including the loaded cell suspension sample. This discontinuous sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. The gradient was eluted from the bottom into 18 fractions of 600 μl each, and stored as 300-μl aliquots at –20 °C for further analysis or directly processed for biochemical assays (see below). Protein content in each fraction was measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For SDS-PAGE, aliquots were further diluted with PBS to 1 ml, and proteins were precipitated by addition of 250 μl of concentrated trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, washed once with acetone, and air dried for 1 h at room temperature. Dried and washed protein pellets were redissolved in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 7.75 mg/ml dithiothreitol, boiled for 3 min, loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and processed for Western analysis as described above. The Western data have been analyzed densitometrically using ChemiImager 5500 software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) and are indicated relative (in %) to the maximum value (100%). Protein content (indicated in μg/ml) was determined for each fraction in both developmental stages, and CWP2 was used as an internal marker for ESV localization. In addition, the activity of the usually Golgi-specific enzyme GlcNAc-transferase was measured in both developmental stages (see below). Glycosyltransferase Assay—N-Acetylglucosamine transferase activity assay was performed essentially as described by Vischer and Hughes (24Vischer P. Hughes R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 275-284Google Scholar). Briefly, 300-μl aliquots of each subcellular fraction were diluted with an equal volume of assay buffer to a final concentration of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm pyrophosphate. To saturate non-catalytic binding of substrate, samples were preincubated with 1 mm cold (unlabeled) UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and 2 mg of ovalbumin as a donor for 2 h at the restrictive temperature of 4 °C. The reaction was started by addition of labeled UDP-N-acetyl-[3H]glucosamine (1.67 kBq per fraction) and shifting the temperature to 37 °C. After 1.5 h of incubation, the reaction was terminated with 1 ml of ice-cold 0.5 m HCl containing 1% phosphotungstic acid. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation and the pellet carefully resuspended in 1 ml of H2O to completely resolve co-precipitated sugars, centrifuged, and incubated with 1 ml of ice-cold 95% ethanol for 5 min at 4 °C. Finally, precipitates were neutralized with 500 μl of 0.5 m NaOH overnight at room temperature and counted in 10 ml of scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on a liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers—The sequence data used for (i) phylogenetic inferences of translated ORFs and/or (ii) for recombinant expression and antibody production have been confirmed by microsequencing (Microsynth GmbH, Balgach, Switzerland) and are available from EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ under the following accession numbers: putative adaptor protein complex large chain subunit BetaB AF503489; putative adaptor protein complex large chain subunit BetaA AF503488; G. intestinalis γ-adaptin gene AF486294; G. intestinalis α-adaptin gene AF486293; putative adaptor protein complex medium subunit (MuA) AY078979; putative adaptor protein complex medium subunit (MuB) AY078978; putative adapt"
https://openalex.org/W2057817131,"Cardiac fibroblasts regulate formation of extracellular matrix in the heart, playing key roles in cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy. In this study, we sought to characterize cross-talk between Gq and Gs signaling pathways and its impact on modulating collagen synthesis by cardiac fibroblasts. Angiotensin II (ANG II) activates cell proliferation and collagen synthesis but also potentiates cyclic AMP (cAMP) production stimulated by β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR). The potentiation of β-AR-stimulated cAMP production by ANG II is reduced by phospholipase C inhibition and enhanced by overexpression of Gq. Ionomycin and thapsigargin increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and potentiated isoproterenol- and forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, whereas chelation of Ca2+ with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′, N′-tetraacetic acid/AM inhibited such potentiation. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, protein kinase C, or Gβγ did not alter this cross-talk. Immunoblot analyses showed prominent expression of adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3), a Ca2+-activated isoform, along with AC2, AC4, AC5, AC6, and AC7. Of those isoforms, only AC3 and AC5/6 proteins were detected in caveolin-rich fractions. Overexpression of AC6 increased βAR-stimulated cAMP accumulation but did not alter the size of the ANG II potentiation, suggesting that the cross-talk is AC isoform-specific. Isoproterenol-mediated inhibition of serum-stimulated collagen synthesis increased from 31 to 48% in the presence of ANG II, indicating that βAR-regulated collagen synthesis increased in the presence of ANG II. These data indicate that ANG II potentiates cAMP formation via Ca2+-dependent activation of AC activity, which in turn attenuates collagen synthesis and demonstrates one functional consequence of cross-talk between Gq and Gs signaling pathways in cardiac fibroblasts.

Cardiac hypertrophy is associated with increased cardiac mass, a gradual decline in contractile function and eventual heart failure. The remodeling associated with these changes involves an altered balance of synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptors; ANG II, angiotensin II; AC, adenylyl cyclase; PKC, protein kinase C; ISO, isoproterenol; βAR, β-adrenergic receptors; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′, N′-tetraacetic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; RT, reverse transcriptase; PLC, phospholipase C. by cardiac fibroblasts and can lead to abnormal accumulation of ECM in the interstitial space (i.e. fibrosis) (1Eghbali M.

Several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) that signal through Gq have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and failure (3Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Google Scholar, 4Ramirez M.T. Sah V.P. Zhao X.L. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14057-14061Google Scholar). Conversely, GPCRs that signal via Gs may inhibit collagen deposition by cardiac fibroblasts (5Dubey R.K. Gillespie D.G. Jackson E.K. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 943-948Google Scholar). Two major pro-fibrotic signals in the heart are cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-β, and the peptide hormone ANG II, both of which increase collagen synthesis by cardiac fibroblasts (6Weber K.T. Circulation. 1997; 96: 4065-4082Google Scholar, 7Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. McCulloch A.D. Villarreal F.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 2347-2357Google Scholar). ANG II also inhibits matrix metalloproteinase expression by cardiac fibroblasts, thereby attenuating degradation of ECM proteins (8Brilla C.G. Rupp H. Funck R. Maisch B. Eur. Heart J. 1995; 16: 107-109Google Scholar). An anti-fibrotic role for cAMP is supported by evidence that adenosine and prostacyclin inhibit cardiac fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis through activation of A2b and prostanoid receptors, respectively, which each couple via Gs, to enhanced cAMP production (9Dubey R.K. Gillespie D.G. Zacharia L.C. Mi Z. Jackson E.K. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 716-721Google Scholar, 10Yu H. Gallagher A.M. Garfin P.M. Printz M.P. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1047-1053Google Scholar). β-Adrenergic receptors have been shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation via epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation (11Kim J. Eckhart A.D. Eguchi S. Koch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32116-32123Google Scholar) but their role in regulating collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts is poorly documented. Adenylyl cyclase (AC) catalyzes the synthesis of cAMP and its expression limits the ability of a cardiac cell to maximally produce this second messenger (12Post S.R. Hilal-Dandan R. Urasawa K. Brunton L.L. Insel P.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 75-80Google Scholar, 13Gao M. Ping P. Post S. Insel P.A. Tang R. Hammond H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1038-1043Google Scholar). Nine different transmembrane AC isoforms exist, each with different amino acid sequence, tissue and chromosomal distribution, and regulation (14Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Google Scholar). Differences in regulation include stimulation or inhibition by Gβγ, Ca2+, and various protein kinases. AC5 and AC6, which are the predominant isoforms expressed in cardiac myocytes (15Ishikawa Y. Sorota S. Kiuchi K. Shannon R.P. Komamura K. Katsushika S. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2224-2229Google Scholar), represent a subfamily of ACs that are related in structure and regulation. These isoforms are inhibited by protein kinase A, Ca2+, Gi, Gβγ, and nitric oxide (14Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Google Scholar, 16McVey M. Hill J. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18887-18892Google Scholar, 17Hill J. Howlett A. Klein C. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 233-237Google Scholar). By contrast, AC1, AC3, and AC8 are stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin (yet AC3 can also be inhibited by calmodulin kinase-II) (14Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Google Scholar, 18Choi E.J. Xia Z. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6492-6498Google Scholar, 19Wei J. Wayman G. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24231-24235Google Scholar). AC2 and AC4 are activated by Gβγ and AC2 and AC7 can be activated by phosphorylation by protein kinase A and/or PKC (14Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Google Scholar). Thus, the AC isoform expression in a cell determines the interaction between cAMP production and other signal transduction cascades. Meszaros et al. (20Meszaros J.G. Gonzalez A.M. Endo-Mochizuki Y. Villegas S. Villarreal F.J. Brunton L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C154-C162Google Scholar) have recently described a signaling “cross-talk” between two key GPCR signal transduction pathways in cardiac fibroblasts. Isoproterenol (ISO), a β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) agonist, activates Gs and stimulates cAMP production 10-fold over basal levels. ANG II activates Gq-coupled angiotensin receptors that, by themselves, do not alter cAMP production in cardiac fibroblasts, but in combination with ISO potentiate the βAR response, resulting in a 2-fold potentiation of ISO-stimulated cAMP production. The goal of the present study was to identify the molecular mechanism and physiological consequence of the cross-talk between these two signaling pathways in cardiac fibroblasts. The current data indicate that Gq-mediated elevation of intracellular Ca2+ induced by ANG II potentiates Gs-stimulated cAMP formation, probably via stimulation of AC3. Moreover, we show that the potentiation is functionally relevant: combined treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with ANG II and ISO inhibits ANG II-promoted collagen synthesis more so than ISO alone. Thus, we identify an endogenous signaling pathway by which intracellular Ca2+ enhances cAMP production and limits collagen synthesis, and perhaps fibrosis, in the heart. Materials—Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Primary antibodies to AC isoforms and all secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies to caveolin were from BD Pharmingen. ANG II, UTP, Fura-2/AM, forskolin, and BAPTA/AM were obtained from Calbiochem. All other drugs and reagents were of reagent grade and obtained from Sigma. Preparation and Culture of Adult Rat Cardiac Fibroblasts—Cardiac fibroblasts were prepared from adult male 250–300-g Sprague-Dawley rat hearts. Following rapid excision of the hearts, the ventricles were isolated, minced, pooled, and placed in a collagenase/pancreatin digestion solution. After sequential digestions, the fibroblasts were pelleted and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, fungizone, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gemini Bio-Products). After a 30-min period of attachment to uncoated culture plates, cells that were weakly attached or unattached were rinsed free and discarded. After 2–3 days, confluent cultures were amplified by trypsinization and seeding onto new dishes. For signaling assays, only early passage (≤3) cells grown to 80–90% confluency were used. The purity of these cultures was greater than 95% cardiac fibroblasts as determined by positive staining for vimentin and negative staining for smooth muscle actin and von Willebrand factor, as previously described (21Gustafsson A.B. Brunton L.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1470-1478Google Scholar). Adenoviral Gene Transfer to Cardiac Fibroblasts—Wild-type Gq was cloned into the PACCMVpLpA shuttle vector for production of adenovirus, as previously described (3Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Google Scholar). We found that a titer of 200 virus particles per cell was optimal for Gq expression without cytotoxicity, as determined by trypan blue exclusion and morphological examination with phase-contrast light microscopy. We used 1000 viral particles per cell of an adenovirus construct to maximally overexpress the murine adenylyl cyclase type 6 (AC6) gene, produced as described previously (22Ostrom R.S. Violin J.D. Coleman S. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1075-1079Google Scholar). Cardiac fibroblasts were infected with the appropriate virus and incubated at 37 °C 18–24 h in serum-free DMEM prior to the assays. Preliminary experiments using LacZ expression and β-galactosidase staining indicated that the efficiency of the adenoviral construct to increase gene expression was 40% (data not shown). Quantitation of cAMP Production—Cardiac fibroblasts cultured on 24-well plates were washed three times with 37 °C serum-free and NaHCO3-free DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were equilibrated for 30 min, then assayed for cAMP accumulation by incubation with drugs of interest in the presence of 0.2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 10 min. When antagonists or inhibitors were used, these agents were equilibrated with cells for 15 min before addition of agonists. Assay medium was aspirated and 250 μl of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (7.5% w/v) was immediately added to each well to terminate reactions. Trichloroacetic acid extracts were assayed for cAMP content by either Direct ELISA kit (Assay Designs) or radioimmunoassay as described previously (22Ostrom R.S. Violin J.D. Coleman S. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1075-1079Google Scholar). Data were corrected for the amount of total acid-precipitable protein per well. In other studies, AC activity was measured in cardiac fibroblast membranes as previously described (23Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Drenan R.M. Xiang Y. Regan J.W. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42063-42069Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were prepared by rinsing cells twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline then scraping cells into hypotonic homogenizing buffer (30 mm Na-HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) and homogenizing with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenate was spun at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was then transferred to a clean centrifuge tube and spun at 5,000 × g for 10 min. Pellet was suspended in membrane buffer (30 mm Na-HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) to attain ∼1 mg/ml total protein concentration. Assay was conducted by adding 30 μl of membranes into tubes containing assay buffer (30 mm Na-HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 5 μm GTP, 60 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) and drugs of interest. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and reactions were stopped by boiling for 5 min. cAMP content of each tube was assayed for cAMP content by radioimmunoassay. Intracellular Ca2+ Measurements—Fibroblasts (0.25 × 105 cells) were plated on 22-mm glass coverslips. The cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 1 ml of DMEM containing 1 μm Fura-2/AM at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then washed once with DMEM and placed in a 37 °C chamber containing 1.5 ml of HEPES-buffered saline (HBS: 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), such that groups of 5–8 cells could be viewed using an inverted Olympus IX-70 microscope. Spectrofluorometric measurements were collected using Delta Scan System spectofluorometer (Photon Technology), where the field was excited at 380 and 340 nm and the emission ratio was collected at 511 nm. Agonists were administered from ×1000 stocks to maintain a constant volume of 1.5 ml. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR to Identify AC Isoforms—Total RNA was extracted from cardiac fibroblasts grown to 80–90% confluency on 15-cm plates using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). A DNase reaction was performed to eliminate DNA contaminants and the RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and poly-T priming. Individual isoform-selective primer pairs were used to amplify each isoform of AC. Primers were based on rat or murine sequences as previously described (24Ostrom R.S. Liu X. Head B.P. Gregorian C. Seasholtz T.M. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 983-992Google Scholar). PCR reactions with each primer pair were performed on cDNA template, genomic DNA (positive control), and minus RT (negative control) template using 35 cycles and an annealing temperature of 56 °C. Sequence analysis was used to confirm the identity of all PCR products. Purification of Caveolin-enriched Membrane Fractions—Cardiac fibroblasts were fractionated using a detergent-free method adapted from Song et al. (25Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Google Scholar), and described previously (22Ostrom R.S. Violin J.D. Coleman S. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1075-1079Google Scholar). The faint light-scattering band resulting from sucrose density centrifugation was collected from the 5–35% sucrose interface. The bottom 4 ml of the gradient (45% sucrose) was collected as non-caveolar membranes. Immunoblot Analysis—Individual fractions or whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Nu-PAGE, Invitrogen). Equal volumes of fractions were loaded so that each lane represents similar proportions from the cells, resulting in ∼10-fold lower amounts of protein loaded in the caveolin-enriched membrane fraction lanes. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting and probed with primary antibody (see “Materials”). Bound primary antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence. Images of immunoblot analyses and RT-PCR are representative of at least 3 separate experiments. In some experiments, the optical density of bands was calculated using a digital imaging system and LabWorks software (UVP Bioimaging Systems) and reported as arbitrary optical density units. Assay of Collagenase-sensitive [3H]Proline Incorporation—[3H]Proline incorporation by cardiac fibroblasts was measured according to modified methods of Guarda et al. (26Guarda E. Katwa L.C. Myers P.R. Tyagi S.C. Weber K.T. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 2130-2134Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transferred to 12-well plates then were serum starved in 0% FBS for 24 h. Proline incorporation was then assayed by adding 1 μCi/well of [3H]proline (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) along with, where indicated, drugs of interest and 2.5% FBS for 24 h. Cells were removed by trypsinization and protein precipitated overnight with 20% trichloroacetic acid. Protein was pelleted by centrifugation and washed 3 times with 1.0 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid + 0.01% proline. Pellets were dissolved with 0.2 m NaOH and the solutions titrated to neutral pH with 0.2 m HCl. Collagenase (2 mg/ml: Worthington Biochemical Corp.) in Tris/CaCl2/N-ethymaleimide buffer was added to each tube and samples were allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then placed on ice and proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and the collagenase-sensitive [3H]proline in the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Analysis of Data—Statistical comparisons (t tests and one-way analysis of variance) and graphics were performed using Graph Pad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software). Cross-talk between ANG II and βAR Signaling Pathways Is Mediated by Phospholipase C and Gq—Meszaros et al. (20Meszaros J.G. Gonzalez A.M. Endo-Mochizuki Y. Villegas S. Villarreal F.J. Brunton L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C154-C162Google Scholar) have described that ANG II, perhaps acting via Gq, potentiates βAR and Gs-mediated cAMP production in cardiac fibroblasts. In the first series of experiments we assessed whether cross-talk between Gq and Gs was dependent upon Gq-promoted phospholipase C (PLC) activity (promoted by Gq activation). We incubated cardiac fibroblasts with the specific PLC inhibitor, U73122, prior to hormonal stimulation with ANG II (100 nm)or UTP (30 μm) in combination with ISO (1 μm, Fig. 1). UTP provides a second class of agonist to assess cross-talk because it is an efficacious activator of the Gq/PLC/inositol trisphosphate pathway in these cells (20Meszaros J.G. Gonzalez A.M. Endo-Mochizuki Y. Villegas S. Villarreal F.J. Brunton L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C154-C162Google Scholar). Neither ANG II nor UTP alone caused altered cAMP accumulation. At the concentration used in these experiments, ISO routinely produces a 10–12-fold increase in cAMP levels in cardiac fibroblasts (20Meszaros J.G. Gonzalez A.M. Endo-Mochizuki Y. Villegas S. Villarreal F.J. Brunton L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C154-C162Google Scholar). ANG II and UTP potentiated the response to ISO by 1.8 ± 0.1 and 2.0 ± 0.1-fold (relative to ISO alone), respectively. Whereas U73122 alone did not affect basal cAMP accumulation or the ISO response, this inhibitor (at a concentration that reduced stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis 75–80%) completely eliminated the potentiation of cAMP accumulation by ANG II and UTP. These data suggest that Gq-linked activation of PLC is required for the effect of Gq potentiation of Gs-AC activity. To assess whether activation of Gq might mediate the effects of ANG II on βAR signaling, we used adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of Gq to increase its expression in cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). Increased expression of Gq enhanced inositol phosphate accumulation by both ANG II (1.6-fold increase over control) and UTP (2.6-fold increase over control) and significantly enhanced the ANG II potentiation of ISO-stimulated cAMP (3.9 ± 0.5-fold over ISO alone) compared with control cells incubated with the null (PACCMVpLpA) virus (2.5 ± 0.3-fold over ISO alone). Thus, results in Fig. 1 are consistent with the conclusion that activation of GPCRs that activate Gq and PLC enhance βAR/Gs-mediated cAMP formation. To determine whether signaling by Gβγ subunits generated by activation of Gq mediates the observed cross-talk, we used an adenovirus to express the C-terminal peptide of GRK2 (βARK1). This peptide (βARKct) binds to free Gβγ subunits, and inhibits both Gβγ signaling and GRK2 activation (27Drazner M.H. Peppel K.C. Dyer S. Grant A.O. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 288-296Google Scholar). We exposed cardiac fibroblasts to either βARKct or null virus and measured cAMP accumulation stimulated by ISO with and without ANG II. Expression of βARKct did not attenuate ANG II-induced potentiation of ISO-stimulated cAMP accumulation in cardiac fibroblasts (null virus: ISO 10.8 ± 0.2-fold over basal, ANG II + ISO 19.4 ± 2.2; βARKct virus: ISO 9.2 ± 0.5, ANG II + ISO 20.8 ± 0.6) but did induce a 4-fold increase in ISO potency, consistent with its action blocking GRK2 activation (27Drazner M.H. Peppel K.C. Dyer S. Grant A.O. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 288-296Google Scholar). Another possible pathway by which ANG II could effect cAMP production is via receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. However, cross-talk was not inhibited in cells treated with AG1478 (10 μm), a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ANG II + ISO, 2.0 ± 0.1-fold over ISO alone; ANG II + ISO + AG1478 2.0 ± 0.1) or with PP2 (1 μm), a selective Src inhibitor (data not shown). These findings and those of Fig. 1 indicate that ANG II enhances ISO-mediated cAMP production via the action of Gq and PLC rather than Gβγ or tyrosine kinase-associated signaling, an important distinction given that ANG II activates both G protein and tyrosine kinase pathways in cardiac fibroblasts (28Dostal D.E. Booz G.W. Baker K.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 157: 15-21Google Scholar, 29Hou M. Pantev E. Moller S. Erlinge D. Edvinsson L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2000; 168: 301-309Google Scholar). Requirement for Elevation of Intracellular Ca2+ but Not PKC—Because Gq activation by ANG II elevates intracellular Ca2+ levels and activates PKC in cardiac fibroblasts (29Hou M. Pantev E. Moller S. Erlinge D. Edvinsson L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2000; 168: 301-309Google Scholar), we examined the role of both responses as potential mechanisms by which ANG II influences cross-talk with Gs. We utilized the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, to elevate intracellular Ca2+ levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A) that synergistically enhanced ISO-induced cAMP production (Fig. 2B) by 2.7 ± 0.4 to 4.0 ± 0.9-fold compared with ISO alone (indicated by the dashed line) using 10 and 100 nm ionomycin, respectively. Ionomycin alone did not alter basal cAMP production. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of PKC by GF109203X (10 μm) failed to inhibit the ANG II-induced potentiation of the ISO response (ANG II + ISO 2.0 ± 0.1-fold over ISO alone, plus GF109203X 1.9 ± 0.1) but did reduce UTP-stimulated phosphoextracellular signal regulated kinase immunoreactivity (basal, 36 ± 6.1 OD; 100 μm UTP, 1037 ± 41; UTP + GF109203X, 180 ± 14.4). Similar negative results were seen with the PKC inhibitors calphostin C and staurosporine (data not shown). Thus, Gq/Gs cross-talk appears to be mediated by the effect of ANG II to elevate intracellular Ca2+ and not activation of PKC. ANG II and Ionomycin Potentiate Forskolin-induced cAMP Production—To test whether the synergistic effects of ANG II on ISO-stimulated cAMP formation might occur via an effect distal to βAR, we utilized forskolin, which directly activates AC (albeit with some dependence upon Gs). Forskolin (1 μm) alone stimulated cAMP production by 8–10-fold over basal levels, a level of response similar to that seen with 0.1–1 μm ISO. ANG II potentiated forskolin-induced cAMP levels (over forskolin alone) in a concentration-dependent manner in the range tested (1–100 nm), reaching statistical significance at 10 and 100 nm (1.6 and 2-fold over forskolin alone, respectively, Fig. 3A). Likewise, ionomycin (100 nm) significantly potentiated forskolin-induced cAMP levels (from 8.3 ± 1.3-fold alone to 25.5 ± 7.4-fold in combination, relative to controls, Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the effect of ANG II is distal to the receptor and that ionomycin can mimic this effect by elevating intracellular Ca2+. Effects of Ca2+ Store Release and Ca2+ Buffering on Gq-GsCross-talk—We next sought to determine whether Gq-Gs cross-talk might occur via Gq-promoted Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and if we could inhibit the cross-talk by buffering intracellular Ca2+. Thapsigargin, which inhibits the sarcoendoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase pump, elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Thapsigargin at a concentration of 100 nm was maximally efficacious in stimulating rapid Ca2+ release; this concentration also synergistically enhanced forskolin-induced cAMP production (Fig. 4B) with slight but statistically insignificant effects on basal cAMP production. We obtained similar results when these experiments were performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (data not shown), indicating that Ca2+ release from internal stores was sufficient to observe the enhancement in cAMP formation. These results, together with those from the studies with ionomycin, indicate that potentiation of the cAMP signal can occur from elevation of intracellular Ca2+, either by storage release or influx promoted by a Ca2+ ionophore. Conversely, preincubation with 1 μm BAPTA/AM for 30 min prior to agonist stimulation prevented ANG II-induced Ca2+ transients (Fig. 4C) and blocked the synergistic effects of ANG II on forskolin-mediated cAMP production (Fig. 4D). Thus, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ is both necessary and sufficient for potentiation of cAMP production by ANG II. The results seen with forskolin indicate that Ca2+ works at the level of Gs/AC rather than βAR. AC Isoform Expression in Cardiac Fibroblasts—Because the identity of AC isoforms expressed in cardiac fibroblasts could result in specific signaling characteristics, we sought to define the AC isoforms expressed in these cells and in particular to assess isoforms that are regulated by Ca2+. RT-PCR analysis using isoform-specific primers revealed that cardiac fibroblasts express mRNA for AC2, AC3, AC4, AC5, AC6, AC7, and AC8 (Fig. 5A). Each of the primer pairs amplified appropriate genomic DNA sequence but did not yield PCR products when RNA (no reverse transcriptase) was used as template (data not shown). PCR reactions using primers for AC1 and AC9 yielded products that were not of the expected size or sequence. We also conducted immunoblot analysis to detect expression of AC proteins. Because AC immunoreactivity in cardiac myocytes is enriched in buoyant, caveolin-rich fractions in a manner that improves immunological detection (22Ostrom R.S. Violin J.D. Coleman S. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1075-1079Google Scholar, 30Schwencke C. Okumura S. Yamamoto M. Geng Y.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 64-72Google Scholar), we fractionated cardiac fibroblasts to isolate caveolin-rich fractions and performed immunoblot analyses. As shown in Fig. 5B, caveolin-1 immunoreactivity was detected in buoyant fractions (caveolin-rich fraction) and was excluded from non-buoyant fractions. Immunoreactivity for AC3 and AC5/6 (the antibody used does not distinguish between AC5 and AC6) was detected primarily in caveolin-enriched membrane fractions, whereas immunore-activity of AC2, AC4, and AC7 was detected only in non-caveolin-enriched membrane fractions (Fig. 5B). No immunoreactivity was detected for AC8 or AC9 (Fig. 5B). Thus, cardiac fibroblasts express numerous AC isoforms but the isoforms appear to be differentially localized in caveolin-rich membrane microdomains.

https://openalex.org/W2168918909,"Signal transduction downstream HGF receptor (MET) activation involves multiple pathways that account for mitogenesis, motility and morphogenesis in a cell type-dependent fashion. MET receptor is aberrantly expressed in almost 100% of human osteosarcomas. We analyzed the effect of the MET receptor activation in five human osteosarcoma cell lines evaluating the levels of HGF-dependent activation of MAPK and PKB/AKT as biochemical readouts of mitogenic and invasive responses, respectively. All the cell lines tested expressed high levels of the MET proto-oncogene. Four cell lines showed activation of the MAPK cascade upon HGF stimulation, suggesting that this growth factor serves a common proliferative function in osteosarcomas. Two lines showed activation of PKB/AKT that is known to be involved in migration mediated by HGF receptor. Accordingly, cell lines where MAPK cascade was activated responded to HGF with increased proliferation, while induction and inhibition of PKB/AKT activity corresponded to acquisition or block of the invasive-motile response to HGF, respectively. Both the HGF dependent responses were reverted by the specific MET inhibitor K252a. These data show that HGF activates both the mitogen and motogen machinery in osteosarcoma cells and suggest that HGF might promote their malignant behavior by concomitant activation of different pathways and biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1972600045,"This study aimed to determine for the first time whether leptin can act to alter the structural and functional characteristics of adipose tissue before birth. Leptin (0.48 mg/kg/day) or saline was infused intravenously into fetal sheep for 4 days from either 136 or 137 days of gestation (term=147+/-3 days). Circulating leptin concentrations were increased approximately four- to fivefold by leptin infusion. Leptin infusion resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of smaller lipid locules present within fetal perirenal adipose tissue (PAT), and this was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of multilocular tissue and a significant decrease in the proportion and relative mass of unilocular tissue in fetal PAT. The relative abundance of leptin mRNA in fetal PAT was significantly lower in the leptin-infused group, and there was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of leptin mRNA and the proportion of unilocular adipose tissue in fetal PAT. The amount of uncoupling protein 1 tended to be higher (P=0.06) in leptin-infused compared with saline-infused fetuses. This is the first demonstration that leptin can act to regulate the lipid storage characteristics, leptin synthetic capacity, and potential thermogenic functions of fat before birth."
https://openalex.org/W2125042799,"Protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) tether cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to specific subcellular locations. The muscle AKAP, mAKAP, co-localizes with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> release channel or ryanodine receptor (RyR). The purpose of this study was to determine whether anchoring of PKA by mAKAP regulates RyR function. Either mAKAP or mAKAP-P, which is unable to anchor PKA, was expressed in CHO cells stably expressing the skeletal muscle isoform of RyR (CHO-RyR1). Immunoelectron microscopy showed that mAKAP co-localized with RyR1 in disrupted skeletal muscle. Following the addition of 10 μm forskolin to activate adenylyl cyclase, RyR1 phosphorylation in CHO-RyR1 cells expressing mAKAP increased by 42.4 ± 6.6% (<i>n</i> = 4) compared with cells expressing mAKAP-P. Forskolin treatment alone did not increase the amplitude of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> transient in CHO-RyR1 cells expressing mAKAP or mAKAP-P; however, forskolin plus 10 mm caffeine elicited a cytosolic Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> transient, the amplitude of which increased by 22% (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in RyR1/mAKAP-expressing cells compared with RyR1/mAKAP-P-expressing cells. Therefore, localization of PKA by mAKAP at RyR1 increases both PKA-dependent RyR phosphorylation as well as efflux of Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> through the RyR. Therefore, RyR1 function is regulated by mAKAP targeting of PKA, implying an important functional role for PKA phosphorylation of RyR in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2076669786,"Like the full-length histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4, its amino terminus (amino acids 1–208) without the carboxyl deacetylase domain is also known to effectively bind and repress myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Within this repressive amino terminus, we further show that a stretch of 90 amino acids (119–208) displays MEF2 binding and repressive activity. The same region is also found to associate specifically with HDAC1 which is responsible for the repressive effect. The amino terminus of HDAC4 can associate with the DNA-bound MEF2 in vitro, suggesting that it does not repress MEF2 simply by disrupting the ability of MEF2 to bind DNA. In vivo, MEF2 induces nuclear translocation of both the full-length HDAC4 and HDAC4-(1–208), whereas the nuclear HDAC4 as well as HDAC4-(1–208) in turn specifically sequesters MEF2 to distinct nuclear bodies. In addition, we show that MyoD and HDAC4 functionally antagonize each other to regulate MEF2 activity.

Two families of transcription factors, namely the myogenic regulatory factors and the myocyte enhancer factor 2s (MEF2s), 1The abbreviations used are: MEF2s, myocyte enhancer factor 2s; HDAC, histone deacetylase; aa, amino acids; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WCEs, whole cell extracts; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TSA, trichostatin A; CtBP, carboxyl-terminal binding protein; MITR, MEF2-interacting transcription repressor. 1The abbreviations used are: MEF2s, myocyte enhancer factor 2s; HDAC, histone deacetylase; aa, amino acids; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WCEs, whole cell extracts; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TSA, trichostatin A; CtBP, carboxyl-terminal binding protein; MITR, MEF2-interacting transcription repressor. play key and decisive roles during myogenesis (1Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Google Scholar, 2Arnold H.H. Winter B. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 539-544Google Scholar, 3Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 155-173Google Scholar). Myogenic regulatory factors and MEF2s can physically interact with each other to activate synergistically muscle-specific genes and are involved in regulating each other's expression (1Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Google Scholar).Several myogenic differentiation model systems based on cell cultures (e.g. C2C12 and L6) are available, which recapitulate some of the key steps during myogenesis and are useful in dissecting the signaling pathways controlling myogenesis. In proliferating C2C12 myoblasts, it is known that MyoD and several MEF2 members are already present (4Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24927-24933Google Scholar, 5Neville C. Rosenthal N. McGrew M. Bogdanova N. Hauschka S. Methods Cell Biol. 1997; 52: 85-116Google Scholar). However, they are functionally repressed to ensure that differentiation does not start precociously (6Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Google Scholar, 7Puri P.L. Iezzi S. Stiegler P. Chen T.T. Schiltz R.L. Muscat G.E. Giordano A. Kedes L. Wang J.Y. Sartorelli V. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 885-897Google Scholar, 8Mal A. Sturniolo M. Schiltz R.L. Ghosh M.K. Harter M.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1739-1753Google Scholar). The underlying repression mechanisms have just begun to be unraveled, which represent one of the major breakthroughs in the study of myogenesis in recent years. Both myogenic regulatory factors and MEF2s are bound and repressed by members of the histone deacetylase family (HDACs) (9McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Google Scholar, 10McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 763-772Google Scholar). HDACs are thought to repress transcription by removing the acetyl group from histone tails resulting in tighter packaging of nucleosomes and reduced access of transcription factors to regulatory regions of genes (11Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Google Scholar, 12Khochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C. Seigneurin-Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2001; 11: 162-166Google Scholar). In addition to histones, HDACs are also known to deacetylate other cellular proteins including p53, MyoD, and tubulin, which modulate their biological activities ranging from DNA binding to microtubule dynamics (8Mal A. Sturniolo M. Schiltz R.L. Ghosh M.K. Harter M.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1739-1753Google Scholar, 13Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Google Scholar, 14Vaziri H. Dessain S.K.

Yao T.P. Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Google Scholar). MyoD is bound and repressed by class I HDACs, whereas MEF2s are directly bound and repressed by class II HDACs (9McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Google Scholar, 10McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 763-772Google Scholar). Whereas the MADS/MEF2 motifs in MEF2 proteins directly interact with the class II HDACs, conserved motifs in the amino termini of the class II HDACs bind MEF2s (6Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Google Scholar, 16Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Google Scholar, 17Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Google Scholar). One of the characteristic features of the class II HDACs is that they shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm under different cellular conditions (9McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Google Scholar, 10McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 763-772Google Scholar, 12Khochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C.

In the nucleus, class II HDACs mainly localize at nuclear bodies, the distinct punctate/or speckle-like structures with unknown identity (20Downes M. Ordentlich P. Kao H.Y. Alvarez J.G. Evans R.M.

For HDAC5 and -7, they are preferentially nuclearly localized in proliferating myoblasts (22McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Google Scholar, 23Dressel U. Bailey P.J. Wang S.C. Downes M. Evans R.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17007-17013Google Scholar). At the start of differentiation in response to the Ca2+/calmodulin-activated protein kinase-mediated signaling pathway, HDAC5/7 dissociate from MEF2s and translocate to the cytoplasm where they are retained by associating with 14-3-3 (22McKinsey T.A.

Although HDAC4 is equally effective in repressing MEF2 activities in reporter assays and in inhibiting differentiation of C2C12 cells when stably expressed (6Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Google Scholar, 16Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Google Scholar), HDAC4 differs from HDAC5 and -7 in that it is mainly cytoplasmic in proliferating C2C12 and NIH3T3 cells (28Miska E.A. Langley E. Wolf D. Karlsson C. Pines J. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3439-3447Google Scholar, 29Zhao X. Ito A. Kane C.D. Liao T.S. Bolger T.A. Lemrow S.M. Means A.R. Yao T.P. J. Biol.

Langley E. Wolf D. Karlsson C. Pines J. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3439-3447Google Scholar, 29Zhao X. Ito A. Kane C.D. Liao T.S. Bolger T.A. Lemrow S.M. Means A.R. Yao T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35042-35048Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism and its biological significance remain unclear.Although HDAC4 contains a canonical deacetylase domain at its carboxyl terminus, it is enzymatically inactive on its own and exerts its repressive effect through recruitment of a corepressor complex consisting of HDAC3, SMRT, and N-CoR (31Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Hendzel M.J. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Voelter W. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 45-57Google Scholar). Interestingly, the amino termini of HDAC4 (aa 1–208), -7 (aa 1–372), and -9 (aa 1–590, also called MEF2-interacting transcription repressor or MITR), in the absence of their carboxyl-terminal deacetylase domains, are also capable of repressing MEF2s (17Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Google Scholar, 23Dressel U. Bailey P.J. Wang S.C. Downes M. Evans R.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17007-17013Google Scholar, 32Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Google Scholar). In the case of MITR, the underlying repression mechanisms are thought to be due to recruitment of either the carboxyl-terminal binding protein (CtBP), a transcription corepressor, or HDAC1 (32Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Google Scholar, 33Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Lu J.R. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35-39Google Scholar). Although a conserved CtBP-binding motif has been found in both MITR and HDAC4, mutations that disrupt CtBP binding to MITR only partially relieve the repressive effect of MITR, suggesting the existence of a second repressive region in the amino termini of MITR and HDAC4 (33Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Lu J.R. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35-39Google Scholar). The identity of this second repressive region in either HDAC4 or MITR remains uncharacterized.In this report, we looked further into the mechanism by which the amino terminus of HDAC4 (i.e. aa 1–208) represses MEF2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, DNA Constructs, and Reagents—HeLa and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. C2C12 cells were grown in DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (also called growth medium) and were induced to differentiate in DMEM containing 2% horse serum and antibiotics (differentiation medium) when cells were near-confluent. 3xMEF2-luc, 5xGal4-luc, Gal4-MEF2C, GFP-HDAC4, and FLAG-HDAC4 were described previously (17Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Google Scholar, 34Xu Q. Yu L. Liu L. Cheung C.F. Li X. Yee S.P. Yang X.J. Wu Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1940-1952Google Scholar). FLAG-MEF2-(1–105) was a generous gift from E. Olson. FLAG-Six1 was constructed by inserting the mouse Six1 cDNA into the NheI/NotI sites of pcDNA3 containing a cassette encoding the FLAG tag. xp-HDAC4-(1–208) and xp-HDAC4-(119–208) were constructed by inserting the cDNA fragments amplified by PCR into pcDNA3.1HisC (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. Antibodies employed in this work included anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) and anti-Xpress (or Omni-probe, M21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HDAC4-(1–208)-GFP and GFP-MEF2 were constructed by inserting the corresponding cDNA fragments into pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C1, respectively (Invitrogen). Trichostatin A was purchased from Calbiochem.Transfection, Cell Lysis, and Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were first transfected with various plasmids using LipofectAMINE™ Plus reagents (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction and cultured in either DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24–36 h (for HeLa and COS-7) or growth medium for 36 h followed by culturing in differentiation medium for another 30 h (for C2C12) prior to harvest. Cells were then lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaF, 20 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μm sodium vanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin), followed by removal of insoluble debris with a bench-top centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 2 min to obtain whole cell extracts (WCEs). Luciferase activity was determined with a luciferase assay kit (Roche Applied Science) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego). Luciferase units were normalized against total protein amount present in each sample determined by protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad.Fluorescence Imaging of Live Cells—Fluorescent images of live HeLa or C2C12 myoblasts containing GFP fusion proteins were acquired by an Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope linked to a charge-coupled device digital camera (Spot RT, Diagnostic Instruments Inc.).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing a consensus MEF2 site, 5′-GATCGCTCTAAAAATAACCCTGTCG-3′ (sense) (sc-2521, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Unin-corporated ATP was removed by QIAquick spin column (Qiagen). For each binding reaction, 10 μg of HeLa WCE was added to a 20-μl reaction mixture containing ∼22,000 cpm of probe, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 20 μg of bovine serum albumin in the binding buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) with or without the recombinant GST-HDAC4-(1–208), GST-HDAC4-(119–208), or GST. All the components above except the probe were first pre-mixed on ice for 30 min. Upon addition of the probe, the binding reactions were carried out for another 20 min at room temperature. The samples were loaded onto a 3.75% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was performed at 200 V for 2 h at 4 °C. The gel was subsequently dried and subjected to autoradiography.Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—COS-7 cells were co-transfected with various plasmids. 36 h after transfection, the cells were crosslinked with 20 μg/ml dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) for 5 min followed by lysis in RIPA buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin). Protein A-Sepharose beads were first preincubated with 50 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin for 30 min to reduce nonspecific binding. 200 μg of extracts were then added along with 2 μg of anti-Xpress antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with the RIPA buffer, bound proteins were eluted out by boiling and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Pull-down Assays Using Biotinylated Oligonucleotide Probes Containing Either a Wild Type or a Mutant MEF2 Site—The sense strand of a wild type MEF2 oligonucleotide (5′-AAAAAAGGCTCTAAAAATAACCCCC-3′) (6Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Google Scholar) was synthesized with a covalently linked 5′ biotin and annealed to its antisense strand to form a double-stranded probe. The mutant biotinylated MEF2 oligonucleotide is identical to the wild type one except for two base changes (in lowercase letters) in the MEF2 site: 5′-AAAAAAGGCTgTAAAcATAACCCCC-3′. COS-7 WCE containing FLAG-MEF2-(1–105) was preincubated with that containing either xp-HDAC4-(1–208) or FLAG-HDAC4FL at a 1.5 to 1 (v/v) ratio in the presence of 1 μg/ml herring sperm DNA to minimize any nonspecific binding of cellular proteins to the MEF2 oligonucleotides in the following step. The combined extracts were then added to streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) with or without the pre-bound biotinylated MEF2 oligonucleotides and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Following extensive washing (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5% (v/v) glycerol), proteins retained were eluted out by boiling in 1× SDS sample buffers.Western Blot Analysis—Eluted proteins from pull-down or immunoprecipitation assays, together with their input controls (20–30 μg of WCEs), were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immuno-Blot™ PVDF; Bio-Rad), and probed with various antibodies. Protein bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Multiple Sequence Alignment—Amino acid sequences of human HDAC4 (SwissProt accession number P56524), HDAC5 (RefSeq accession number NP_005465.1), HDAC7 (GenBank™ accession number AAF63491.1), and MITR (RefSeq accession number NP_478056.1) were aligned by the ClustalX 1.81 using the GONNET series as the Multiple alignment parameter (35Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Google Scholar). Similarity calculation of residues was performed using the BLOSUM62 Matrix (36Henikoff J.G. Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 88-105Google Scholar).RESULTSThe Amino-terminal Region (aa 119–208) of HDAC4 Represses MEF2-dependent Transcription—It was shown previously that an amino-terminal fragment of HDAC4 (i.e. aa 1–208) binds MEF2 and represses MEF2-dependent transcription (17Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Google Scholar). A smaller fragment (aa 119–208) of HDAC4 was also shown to bind MEF2 (17Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether it still processes the MEF2 repressive activity. To confirm the previous result and to further define the region that contains the repressive activity, we performed a reporter assay in HeLa cells using a MEF2-dependent luciferase reporter (3xMEF2-luc). In agreement with previous results, the full-length HDAC4 and HDAC4-(1–208) significantly repressed MEF2-dependent transcription (Fig. 1A) (17Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Google Scholar). Interestingly, HDAC4-(119–208) also repressed MEF2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Although HDAC4-(119–208) was less repressive compared with the full-length and HDAC4-(1–208), at a higher dose it could still repress the activity of the MEF2 reporter below the basal level. To test whether HDAC4-(119–208) also repressed the endogenous MEF2, we co-transfected myogenic C2C12 cells with 3xMEF2-luc along with either the full-length HDAC4 or its two amino-terminal derivatives. As shown in Fig. 1B, all three HDAC4 constructs repressed the activity of the endogenous MEF2s to different extent with the full-length HDAC4 being the most repressive (∼95%) and HDAC4-(119–208) being the least repressive (∼50%). Therefore, our results here demonstrated that HDAC4-(119–208) can repress MEF2 in vivo.The Amino-terminal Derivatives of HDAC4 Repress MEF2 Without Interfering with MEF2 DNA Binding—In the reporter assays above, the repression of MEF2 by HDAC4 or its amino-terminal derivatives could conceivably be caused by a block to either DNA binding or transactivating function of MEF2. To distinguish between the two possible mechanisms, we fused the genes encoding the full-length MEF2C and the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4DBD, aa 1–147) to generate the Gal4-MEF2 fusion protein, and we tested the repressive effect of the full-length HDAC4 and its amino-terminal derivatives on this fusion protein. As the MEF2 DNA binding domain was not required in this assay system, any repression detected would most likely be due to an effect on the transactivating function of MEF2. As shown in Fig. 2A, both the full-length HDAC4 and its amino-terminal derivatives repressed the transcriptional activity of the fusion protein, suggesting that they repress MEF2 by interfering with the transactivating function of MEF2. To prove directly that the amino-terminal derivatives of HDAC4 repress MEF2 without affecting its binding to DNA, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using HeLa whole cell extracts. Our electrophoretic mobility shift assays resolved at least two MEF2-containing bands (Fig. 2B, lane 1), indicating the existence of different MEF2-containing higher order protein complexes. Importantly, both bands shifted upwards (supershift) in the presence of the bacterially expressed GST-HDAC-(1–208) or GST-HDAC4-(119–208), indicative of binding of GST-HDAC4-(1–208) and GST-HDAC4-(119–208) to the pre-existing MEF2-DNA complexes (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Addition of GST alone had no such supershift effect (Fig. 2B, lane 5). In HeLa cells transfected with increasing amounts of HDAC4-(1–208) at doses that were sufficient to repress MEF2 activity in the reporter assays, we detected no obvious change in the intensity and migration pattern of the MEF2-DNA complexes compared with the control (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8 versus 6), nor could the transfected HDAC-(119–208) affect MEF2 binding to DNA (data not shown). Furthermore, in a direct pull-down assay using double-stranded biotinylated oligonucleotides containing either a wild type or a mutant MEF2-binding site, we showed that both HDAC4-(1–208) and the full-length HDAC4 could be pulled down by FLAG-MEF2-(1–105) only when the wild type MEF2 oligonucleotide was present (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 7). In contrast, the mutant MEF2 oligonucleotide (lanes 5 and 8) and the streptavidin beads alone (lanes 6 and 9) failed to pull down significant amounts of HDAC4-(1–208) and the full-length HDAC4. This suggests that HDAC4 and its amino-terminal derivative can specifically bind to the DNA-bound MEF2. Collectively, our results above demonstrated that the amino-terminal derivatives of HDAC4 repress MEF2 without interfering with MEF2 binding to DNA.Fig. 2The amino-terminal derivatives of HDAC4 repress MEF2 without interfering with the DNA binding activity of MEF2.A, HeLa cells were co-transfected with a 5xGal4-luc reporter along with Gal4DBD-(1–147), Gal4-MEF2C, HDAC4FL, and two derivatives of HDAC4 in various combinations as indicated. Luciferase activity and fold activation were determined as in Fig. 1. B, assay of MEF2 DNA binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. HeLa cells were either left untransfected (lanes 1–5), transfected with either an empty vector (lane 6), or different amounts of xp-HDAC4-(1–208) (lanes 7 and 8). 10 μg of WCE was incubated with the labeled probe either in the absence (lanes 1, 2, and 6–8) or presence of various purified GST proteins as indicated. In lane 2, 50× cold probe was added. C, WCE of COS-7 cells containing FLAG-MEF2-(1–105) was mixed in vitro with that containing either FLAG-HDAC4(FL) or xp-HDAC4-(1–208) with or without the wild type (wt) or mutant (mt) biotinylated MEF2 oligonucleotide and streptavidin beads. The result shown was an overlay of two immunoblot images of the same membrane probed separately with anti-Xpress and anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively.

McKinsey T.A. Lu J.R. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35-39Google Scholar), this could partially account for the repressive effect of HDAC4-(1–208). In contrast, HDAC4-(119–208) was devoid of the CtBP-binding motif and any intrinsic deacetylase domain; this suggested that HDAC4-(119–208) may repress transcription by recruiting additional repressors. We first carried out a co-immunoprecipitation assay to test whether HDAC4-(119–208) forms complexes with other HDACs in vivo. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with various expression constructs as indicated (Fig. 3A). Although we failed to detect stable binding of either HDAC4, HDAC3 (data not shown), or Six1 to HDAC4-(119–208), we could clearly detect binding of HDAC1 to HDAC4-(119–208), suggesting that HDAC4-(119–208) could repress MEF2 by recruiting HDAC1 (Fig. 3A). In addition, we showed that the repressive effect of HDAC4-(119–208) on the MEF2-dependent reporter could be partially relieved by treatment of cells with trichostatin A (TSA) (Fig. 3B), a specific inhibitor of HDACs (37Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Google Scholar). This further supported our notion that HDAC4-(119–208) recruits HDAC1 to exert the repressive effect.Fig. 3HDAC4-(119–208) represses MEF2 by specifically recruiting HDAC1.A, COS-7 cells were separately transfected with FLAG-HDAC4, FLAG-HDAC1, and FLAG-Six1 together with either xp-HDAC4-(119–208) or an empty vector as indicated. Dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (20 μg/ml) was added into the culture media for 5 min before cell harvest. 200 μg of WCEs were incubated with an anti-Xpress antibody for immunoprecipitation, and the membrane was immunoblotted with an anti-FLAG antibody (bottom panel). 20 μg of each input samples were also blotted with an anti-FLAG antibody (top panel).

McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Google Scholar, 38Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Google Scholar), we asked whether MyoD and HDAC4s antagonize each other in regulating MEF2 activity. As seen in Fig. 4A, the repression of MEF2 by HDAC4 and its amino-terminal derivatives could be effectively relieved by MyoD in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, MyoD was more effective in relieving MEF2 repressed by the amino-terminal derivatives than by the full-length HDAC4. The result above indicated that overexpression of MyoD could switch MEF2 from a repressed state to a highly activated state. Interestingly, MyoDT4basic, a MyoD mutant defective in MEF2 binding, failed to de-repress MEF2 as effectively as the wild type MyoD did (Fig. 4B) (39Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Google Scholar). This suggested that direct MEF2 binding is a prerequisite for MyoD to antagonize HDAC4. To demonstrate further that MyoD and HDAC4 compete to regulate MEF2, we studied the effect of HDAC4 and its amino-terminal derivatives on MyoD-mediated synergistic activation of 3xMEF2-luc. In the absence of HDAC4, addition of MyoD significantly activated the reporter gene activity due to interaction of the transfected MyoD with the endogenous MEF2 (Fig. 4C). In the presence of either HDAC4 or its amino-terminal derivatives, the synergistic effect between MyoD and MEF2 was significantly reduced/abolished (Fig. 4C). Therefore, our data above support the hypothesis that MyoD and HDAC4 antagon"
https://openalex.org/W2115735203,"In addition to inhibiting formation of prothrombotic eicosanoids, aspirin causes the acetylation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. The acetylated COX-2 remains active, and upon cell activation, initiates the generation of 15R-HETE, a lipid substrate for 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) leading to the formation of 15-epi-LXA4 (also termed ""aspirin-triggered lipoxin,"" or ATL). Because ATL potently inhibits polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) function, we assessed the relative contribution of this lipid mediator in conjunction with another 5-LOX product, the leukotriene (LT)B4, to the pathogenesis of acute damage and gastric adaptation to aspirin. Data presented herein indicate that acute injury and gastric adaptation to aspirin is associated with ATL generation. Administration of COX inhibitors (celecoxib, indomethacin, ketoprofen) to aspirin-treated rats exacerbated acute injury and abolished adaptation to aspirin. Moreover, it inhibited ATL formation and caused a four- to fivefold increase in LTB4 synthesis. In contrast, licofelone, a COX/5-LOX inhibitor, did not exacerbate acute gastric injury nor did it interfere with gastric adaptation to aspirin. Although licofelone blocked ATL and LTB4 formation in aspirin-treated rats, it attenuated aspirin-induced gastric PMN margination. These findings indicate that the balance between the production of LTB4 and ATL modulates PMN recruitment/function and gastric mucosal responses to aspirin."

The crystals belong to the P63 space group with cell dimensions of 153 Å × 153 Å × 59 Å with a single (αβ) monomer in the asymmetric unit, resulting in a solvent content of 65%, and diffract to 2.7 Å. The PC612 crystal structure has been determined by molecular replacement and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 20.9% (R free = 27.8%). The crystal packing in this form shows that the PC612 form of phycocyanin does not associate into hexamers and that its association with adjacent trimers in the unit cell is very different from that found in a previously determined structure of the normal form of T. vulcanus phycocyanin, which absorbs at 620 nm. Analysis of the PC612 structure shows that the α subunits, which typically form the interface between two trimers within a hexamer, have a high degree of flexibility, as indicated by elevated B-factors in portions of helices B, E, and G. Examination of calculated electron density omit maps shows that unlike all other structures of phycobiliproteins determined so far, the Asnβ72 residue is not methylated, explaining the blue-shift in its absorption spectra. On the basis of the results presented here, we suggest that this new form of trimeric phycocyanin may constitute a special minor component of the phycobilisome and may form the contact between the phycocyanin rods and the allophycocyanin core.

The PB is the largest type of all photosynthetic antenna pigment-protein complexes attached to photosynthetic reaction centers. The sizes of such complexes vary between species and growth conditions and can easily reach molecular masses in excess of 2 MDa. The self-association of the protein subunits has been studied and documented for a variety of species and shows different complex forms. All pigment-binding protein species show a canonical first level quaternary structure of the association of two pigment-binding subunits termed α and β into the basic (αβ) monomer. The monomers further assemble into higher organizational levels of (αβ)3 trimers and (αβ)6 hexamers. The trimers (and hexamers) are round disks with dimensions of about 110 × 30 Å (or 60 Å for the hexamers). The hexamer encloses a large internal cavity with triangular shaped openings on both sides. The most prevalent PB forms, found in many cyanobacteria, are made up of a core assembly of three hexamers of allophycocyanin (APC) that are arranged with their ring planes perpendicular to the membrane surface directly above Photosystem II complexes (4MacColl R. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). On this core are arranged six rod-like structures, made up of phycocyanin (PC) hexamers. In some species, and under certain environmental conditions, additional phycoerythrin (or other phycobiliprotein variants) hexamers attach at the terminal ends of the PC rods (12Duerring M. Schmidt G.B. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The planes of the rings that make up the hexamers in the rods are perpendicular to both the APC core and to the membrane, so that in essence the APC hexamer disks bind the PC rods by their outer circumference. In addition to the pigment-binding pycobiliproteins, a number of linker proteins have been found associated with PB components (6Tandeau de Marsac N. Cohen-Bazire G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1635-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Glauser M. Bryant D.A. Frank G. Wehrli E. Rusconi S.S. Sidler W. Zuber H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these linker proteins occupy positions running through the internal cavities of the disks and may play roles in complex stabilization, rod-core assembly, and in inducing the directionality of energy transfer toward Photosystem II. Light energy trapped by the most prevalent pigments (phycoerythrobilin, λmax = 560 nm; phycocyanobilin, λmax = 620 nm) traverses down through the rods to the APC pigments (λmax = 652 nm) and from these pigments to the chlorophyll pigments of the reaction center (λmax = 674–680 nm) (3Huber R.

All of these structures show a very high degree of similarity in the overall structures, the details of the pigment surroundings, the solvent interactions, and the protein residue positions in each structure, and thus have given us an excellent molecular view of the constituents of the PBs. However, a true structural description of how these different components interact is still lacking, due to the fact that the structures of each of the components has been determined separately. Because there appears to be a certain degree of correlation between the formation of hexamers and rods during the crystallization process and the actual PB rods, it has been suggested that the overall packing of the crystal unit cell can help identify energy transfer pathways between pigments at all levels, including inter-rod energy transfer (9Schirmer T. Huber R. Schneider M. Bode W. Miller M. Hackert M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 651-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 20Stec B. Troxler R.F. Teeter M.M. Biophys.

Biochemical, biophysical, and electron microscopic studies of the PB have been interpreted and promoted a number of models of the entire PB (5Anderson L.K. Toole C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Yu M.H. Glazer A.N. Williams R.C. J. Biol.

These studies were performed on a variety of PB forms, from different species, with different numbers of APC core disks. There are, however, geometric problems with the schematic models of the PB structure. To assemble six PC rods around the three APC disks, interpenetration of the rods must occur, because the circumference if the core is significantly smaller than the sum of the rod diameters. Interpenetration of the circumference of one PC hexamer into the molecular circumference of an adjacent hexamer would necessitate the presence of large cavities in the circumference. Analysis of the crystal structures of many PC hexamers has not shown such cavities to exist, indicating that such interpenetration is not possible. We have recently determined the structure of the PC component of phycobilisomes from the thermophilic cyanobacteria Thermosynchococcus vulcanus (Tv-PC, formally Synechococcus vulcanus) at high resolution (1.6 Å, Protein Data Bank code 1KTP; see Ref. 25Adir N. Vainer R. Lerner N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This structure, along with a room-temperature structure at lower resolution (2.5 Å, Protein Data Bank code 1I7Y; see Ref. 23Adir N. Dobrovetsky Y. Lerner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) allowed the detailed analysis of a number of important structural details pertaining to the structure, function, and stability of this protein. In the present study we have identified and determined the structure of a novel form of Tv-PC, which we believe may prove to be a functional and structural link between the rods and cores of the phycobilisomes, helping to avoid the interpenetration problem in PB assembly. Protein Isolation, Characterization, and Crystallization—Phycocyanin with an absorption maxima of 612 nm from the thermophilic cyanobacterium T. vulcanus (PC612) was isolated by the following procedure. Cyanobacterial cells were grown at 55 °C for 3–4 days with 5% CO2 in air added continuously to the growth medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0) and then treated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) at 55 °C for 60 min. The cells were then ruptured using a Yeda Pressure cell using 25 atmospheres of N2. Broken cell debris was separated from the photosynthetic membranes by centrifugation, and the membranes were then pelleted. The supernatant contained large amounts of PC absorbing at 620 nm (PC620). The membranes were then treated with Buffer A with 2 m KCl, which removed the remaining phycobiliproteins. Following removal of the membranes by centrifugation, the soluble fraction was treated with polyethylene glycol 4000 to precipitate contaminating PC620, and fractions that absorbed at 651 nm (APC) were pooled. The APC-rich fraction was further fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography (DEAE, Toyohaas), using Buffer A as the mobile phase. A salt gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in Buffer A was used to separate between different protein fractions, with a fraction containing PC612 eluting at 130 mm NaCl and APC eluting at 200 mm NaCl. Protein fractions were analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE, and the aggregation state was determined by size-exclusion HPLC (PL-GFC 1000 Å, Polymer Laboratories Ltd.). The final PC612 fractions were dialyzed against Buffer A and concentrated to a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. PC612 crystals were obtained by mixing 6.7% polyethylene glycol 4000 with 6.3 mg/ml purified PC612 in the presence of 70 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.0). 6 μl hanging drops were equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir containing 10% polyethylene glycol 4000 in 100 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.0). Data Collection and Structure Determination—PC612 crystallized in the P63 space group with cell dimensions of a = b = 153 Å = 39 Å and γ= 120o and diffracted maximally to 2.7 Å. A data set was collected using a single crystal on beamline X11 of the EMBL-Hamburg outstation at DESY using an MAR CCD detector (Table I). The data was scaled and merged using the DENZO/SCALEPACK suite (30Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs L. Baily S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). The final data was 84.7% complete to 2.7 Å and was used for structure determination by molecular replacement with CNS (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Following simulated annealing, B-factor refinement, and water molecule addition, the structure was inspected against electron density maps calculated in CNS and examined visually using Quanta (Accelrys). Extensive use of calculated omit maps were used to manually adjust and confirm the positions of all residues and co-factors. The final model had a crystallographic R-factor of 20.9% and a R free of 27.8%. The coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the code 1ON7. PC 612 Isolation and Characterization—We have previously determined the structure of Tv-PC in a rhombohedral crystal space group. Protein for crystallization was isolated in trimeric form from the thylakoid membranes following detergent treatment and anion-exchange chromatography (23Adir N. Dobrovetsky Y. Lerner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The isolated protein had an absorption maxima at 620 nm, as has been reported previously (4MacColl R. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) for PC. This form of Tv-PC resulted in two crystal structures, the first from data collected at room temperature (Protein Data Bank code 1I7Y, 2.5 Å resolution; see Ref. 23Adir N. Dobrovetsky Y. Lerner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the second from data collected at 100K from frozen crystals (Protein Data Bank code 1KTP, 1.6 Å resolution; see Ref. 25Adir N. Vainer R. Lerner N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Following our successful determination of the Tv-PC structure at high resolution, we decided to obtain a more complete picture of this species phycobilisomes by determination of the structure of the APC component of the phycobilisome core (5Anderson L.K. Toole C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To obtain APC, we modified the isolation procedure to separate the APC fraction from the bulk PC that is in large excess (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). In the course of isolation of APC, we obtained three fractions: i) APC, with an absorption at λ = 651 nm; ii) a fraction of PC that had an absorption blue-shifted to λ = 612 nm (hence referred to as PC612); and iii), a fraction that appeared to be a mixture of the other two fractions (Fig. 1). All three fractions appeared to have less than 5% non-pigmented protein contaminants by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). Both PC and APC fractions exclusively contained (αβ)3 trimers as identified by size-exclusion HPLC (data not shown). PC 612 Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystallization trials of all three fractions were performed using various modifications of the conditions optimized previously for Tv-PC. Very thin plate-like crystals of purified APC were obtained that were not amenable to structure determination. However, the PC612 fraction crystallized readily, and large blue hexagonal crystals were obtained. X-ray diffraction analysis, performed on an R-Axis IIc diffractometer, showed that these crystals belonged to a hexagonal space group and were unlike the previously described crystal forms of Tv-PC. We thus undertook the task of high-resolution data collection at cryogenic temperature using synchrotron radiation (the EMBL PX beam-line (X11) at the DORIS storage ring, DESY, Hamburg, Germany). The crystals did not diffract as well as the rhombohedral form (25Adir N. Vainer R. Lerner N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); however, a complete data set to 2.7 Å was obtained (Table I). Analysis of the diffraction pattern showed that the crystal unit cell dimensions were about 153 × 153 × 39 Å. Following data processing, using the DENZO/SCALEPACK suite, it became apparent that reflections of the type h = 0, k = 0 had not been collected, and so the exact space group could not be determined by identification of systematic absences. However, processing of the data to higher symmetry hexagonal space groups (P622, P6122, etc.) resulted in high R sym values (> 0.12), whereas those of lower symmetry had R merge values of about 0.06. Molecular replacement (CNS, Ref. 31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) was thus performed using the 1KTP structure in all six hexagonal space groups of type P6, P61, etc. The only space group for which a translation function solution and correct proper packing could be obtained was P63. The crystallographic R-factor for the molecular replacement solution after rigid-body refinement was 0.39. Calculation of the Matthews coefficient (32Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar) indicated the possibility of either one or two (αβ) monomers in the asymmetric unit (V m = 3.55 or 1.78, respectively). Thus at this stage, CNS was used to search for a possible second monomer in the asymmetric unit. No such solution could be obtained, and calculated electron density maps using the unrefined monomer as the source of phases showed clear density for the monomer, without additional protein. Thus the hexagonal crystal form of PC612 has a single monomer in the asymmetric unit, with two (αβ)3 trimers in the unit cell (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the PC612 form of Tv-PC is similar to the first PC structure determined that from Mastigocladus laminosus (this structure has not been deposited in the Protein Data Bank; see Ref. 10Schirmer T. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 677-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Refinement—The PC612 structure was refined using maximum likelihood simulated annealing (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), followed by multiple rounds of B-factor, coordinate minimization, and manual fitting. The locations of 36 water molecules were identified, and the final refined structure (Table II) had a crystallographic R-factor of 20.9% (R free = 27.8%). All geometric constraints were within or better than the mean values as determined by the Protein Data Bank ADIT validation server. Only the highly conserved Thrβ77 residue has non-typical peptide geometry (Φ = 76.7°, Ψ = 128.3°), as has been found for this residue in all previously determined PC structures (10Schirmer T. Bode W.

Biol. 1985; 184: 257-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The overall structure is similar to the previously determined high-resolution structure 1KTP with a root mean square deviation coordinate difference of 0.82 and 1.02 Å over all α carbon and all atoms respectively. However, a number of characteristics make the PC612 structure unique. The (αβ) monomers are organized into (αβ)3 trimers, which were also the basic unit in solution prior to crystallization. The packing of the unit cell (Fig. 2) shows that the trimers are not associated further into (αβ)6 hexamers, as was previously shown in the 1KTP structure, as well as for many other PC structures (8Schirmer T.

The immediate result of this form of crystal packing is a high solvent content (65%) as opposed to only 42% for the 1KTP structure. One consequence of the high solvent content is the relatively high B-factors, especially those of certain stretches of the α subunit. In crystal structures made up of (αβ)6 hexamers (i.e. 1KTP), the α subunit forms most of the trimer-trimer contacts, whereas the β subunits are involved in the formation of both the (αβ) monomer-monomer and in (αβ)6 hexamer-(αβ)6 hexamer interactions. In the PC612 structure, the α subunits have few intermolecular contacts (Fig. 3), whereas the β subunits link one ano"
https://openalex.org/W2046038149,"Eph receptors and their cognate ligand ephrins play important roles in various biological processes such as cell migration, axon guidance, and synaptic plasticity. One characteristic feature of the Eph-ephrin signal transduction is that, upon interaction with the receptor, the transmembrane B-class ephrins become tyrosine-phosphorylated and transduce intracellular signals that lead to reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Although in vitro and genetic studies have demonstrated unequivocally the significance of this reverse signaling, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We report here that transfection of ephrin-B1 into 293 cells resulted in robust increase in JNK activity, whereas expression of truncated ephrin-B1 lacking the cytoplasmic domain had a negligible effect, indicating that the induction of JNK activity was attributed mainly to the reverse signaling. The ephrin-B1-mediated JNK activation was reduced significantly by dominant-negative TAK1, MKK4, or MKK7. Ephrin-B1 over-expressing 293 cells became rounded in morphology. Surprisingly, ephrin-B1 that lacked all six intracellular tyrosine residues still triggered JNK activation and rounding morphology of the transfected cells. Consistent with these observations, activation of JNK and the resulting morphological changes mediated by ephrin-B1 could be abolished by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 but not the Src inhibitor PP2. Taken together, our findings have identified a novel reverse signaling pathway transduced by ephrin-B1, which is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation but involves the activation of JNK through TAK1 and MKK4/MKK7 and leads to changes in cell morphology.

Eph receptors, the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases comprising 14 members in mammals, play critical roles in diverse biological processes during development as well as in the mature animal (1Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Google Scholar, 2Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Google Scholar). They are activated by membrane-bound ligands called ephrins, which are classified into two subclasses based on their modes of membrane anchorage. The ephrin-A ligands (ephrin-A1–A5) are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked and prefer to bind to EphA receptors (EphA1–A8). The ephrin-B ligands (ephrin-B1–B3), which possess a transmembrane moiety and a short cytoplasmic domain, bind to EphB receptors (EphB1–B6). The interactions between ephrins and Eph receptors are generally promiscuous within each subclass. There is little cross-reactivity between members from different subclasses, with the notable exception of EphA4 (3Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E. Henkemeyer M. Strebhardt K. Hirai H. Wilkinson D.G. Pawson T. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1996; 17: 9-19Google Scholar). Based on the prominent expression of ephrins and Eph receptors in the brain, early studies focused on their significance in the nervous system. Elegant in vitro and genetic studies have demonstrated that ephrins act as a repulsive axon guidance cue, which are essential in the formation of topographic mapping in various regions of the central nervous system. Moreover, interactions between Eph receptors and ephrins also govern neural crest cell migration and segmental patterning in the brain. Besides the fact that Eph receptors and ephrins perform important functions during development, more recent studies have unraveled their significance in the mature nervous system, especially in the aspect of synapse formation and functioning. Eph receptors and ephrins are localized at the neuronal synapses as well as the neuromuscular junction (4Torres R. Firestein B.L. Dong H. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Huganir R.L. Bredt D.S. Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1453-1463Google Scholar, 5Lai K.O. Ip F.C.F. Cheung J. Fu A.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 1034-1047Google Scholar), and ephrin-B ligands are involved in the formation of neuronal synapses and long-term potentiation in the hippocampus (6Dalva M.B. Takasu M.A. Lin M.Z. Shamah S.M. Hu L. Gale N.W. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 2000; 103: 945-956Google Scholar, 7Grunwald I.C. Korte M. Wolfer D. Wilkinson G.A. Unsicker K. Lipp H.P. Bonhoeffer T. Klein R. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1027-1040Google Scholar, 8Henderson J.T. Georgiou J. Jia Z. Robertson J. Elowe S. Roder J.C. Pawson T. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1041-1056Google Scholar). Recent studies have also demonstrated the regulation of cell adhesion by Eph receptors, which is central to their participation in vascular development and tumorigenesis outside of the nervous system (9Adams R.H. Klein R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 183-188Google Scholar, 10Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Google Scholar). One unusual feature of Eph-ephrin interaction is that signals can be transduced bidirectionally in both the ligand- and receptor-expressing cells (11Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Trends. Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 339-346Google Scholar). The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked A-class ephrins lack a cytoplasmic domain and intrinsic kinase activity, requiring the recruitment of other signaling molecules to trigger the reverse signaling. One possible candidate is the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fyn, which was found necessary for the reverse signaling mediated by ephrin-A5 (12Davy A. Gale N.W. Murray E.W. Klinghoffer R.A. Soriano P. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3125-3135Google Scholar). The reverse signaling of ephrin-A5 leads to modulation of integrin functions and in turn to the regulation of cell adhesion (13Davy A. Robbins S.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5396-5405Google Scholar, 14Huai J. Drescher U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6689-6694Google Scholar). Interactions between the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked ephrins and VAB-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of EphA receptors, regulate the organization of epidermal cells independently of the kinase activity of VAB-1, thereby providing genetic evidence for the significance of ephrin-A reverse signaling. Upon interaction with EphB receptors, the transmembrane B-class ephrins also transduce intracellular signal. Ample evidence from different in vivo studies supports the biological significance of ephrin-B reverse signaling in axon guidance, hind brain segmentation, and neuronal plasticity. Axons of the anterior commissure, which express the ephrin-B ligands rather than EphB receptors, migrate aberrantly in EphB2 null mice but not in transgenic mice, in which the kinase domain of EphB2 is deleted (15Henkemeyerk M. Orioli D. Henderson J.T. Saxton T.M. Roder J. Pawson T. Klein R. Cell. 1996; 86: 35-46Google Scholar). Similarly, axon pathfinding of retinal ganglion cells within the retina depends on EphB2 in a kinase-independent manner (16Birgbauer E. Oster S.F. Severin C.G. Sretavan D.W. Development. 2001; 128: 3041-3048Google Scholar). During segmentation of the hind brain, EphB-ephrin-B interactions at the boundary of adjacent rhombomeres are crucial to prevent the intermingling of distinct cell populations, and bidirectional signaling of both EphB receptors and ephrin-B ligands is required (17Mellitzer G. Xu Q. Wilkinson D.G. Nature. 1999; 400: 77-81Google Scholar, 18Xu Q. Mellitzer G. Robinson V. Wilkinson D.G. Nature. 1999; 399: 267-271Google Scholar). Mice with targeted deletion of EphB2 display defects in neuronal plasticity, which can be rescued by EphB2 truncated at the carboxyl terminus (7Grunwald I.C. Korte M. Wolfer D. Wilkinson G.A. Unsicker K. Lipp H.P. Bonhoeffer T. Klein R. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1027-1040Google Scholar). The signaling pathways following ephrin-B activation have begun to be elucidated; they may be classified into the phosphotyrosine-dependent pathway and PDZ 1The abbreviations used are: PDZ, PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1; SFK, Src family kinases; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAP3K, MAP kinase kinase kinase; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; PAK, p21-activated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescence protein; PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase; SH2 and SH3, Src homology 2 and 3; RGS, regulator of heterotrimeric G protein signaling; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. -dependent pathway (2Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Google Scholar). In the former, ephrin-B is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon interaction with EphB receptors by the Src family kinases (SFK) (19Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Mbamalu G. Yancopoulos G.D. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 722-725Google Scholar, 20Bruckner K. Pasquale E.B. Klein R. Science. 1997; 275: 1640-1643Google Scholar, 21Palmer A. Zimmer M. Erdmann K.S. Eulenburg V. Porthin A. Heumann R. Deutsch U. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Google Scholar). Sprouting angiogenesis of endothelial cells induced by EphB4-Fc is abolished by the Src inhibitor PP2, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation by SFK is essential for ephrin-B reverse signaling (21Palmer A. Zimmer M. Erdmann K.S. Eulenburg V. Porthin A. Heumann R. Deutsch U. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Google Scholar). On the other hand, a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP-BL) is recruited to the activated ephrin-B1 in a delayed kinetics via interaction between the PDZ domain of PTP-BL and the carboxyl tail of ephrin-B1, after which ephrin-B1 is dephosphorylated and the phosphotyrosine-dependent reverse signaling is switched off (21Palmer A. Zimmer M. Erdmann K.S. Eulenburg V. Porthin A. Heumann R. Deutsch U. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrin-B1 results in the binding of the adaptor protein Grb4 via interaction with its SH2 domain. The latter in turn recruits various signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Cbl-associated protein (CAP) to the ephrin-B signaling complexes via its multiple SH3 domains, eventually leading to disassembly of F-actin and rounding cell morphology (22Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Google Scholar). In addition to the phosphorylation-dependent pathway, another pathway in the reverse signaling that requires the carboxyl-terminal PDZ-binding motif of ephrin-B1 has been elucidated. Besides PTP-BL, a number of PDZ domain-containing proteins such as GRIP-1, GRIP-2, and syntenin have been identified as interacting with the carboxyl tail of ephrin-B1 (4Torres R. Firestein B.L. Dong H. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Huganir R.L. Bredt D.S. Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1453-1463Google Scholar, 23Bruckner K. Pablo Labrador J. Scheiffele P. Herb A. Seeburg P.H. Klein R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 511-524Google Scholar, 24Lin D. Gish G.D. Songyang Z. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3726-3733Google Scholar); however, their significance with respect to the propagation of reverse signaling is not clear. Recently a novel protein, called PDZ-RGS3, was found to interact with ephrin-B1 via its PDZ domain. Interestingly, PDZ-RGS3 contains a regulator of heterotrimeric G protein signaling (RGS) domain, which accelerates the G protein catalytic cycle and thus inhibits the signaling transduced by G protein-coupled receptor. It was found that interaction between ephrin-B1 and PDZ-RGS3 was essential in the ephrin-B1-mediated cell dissociation in Xenopus embryo (25Lu Q. Sun E.E. Klein R.S. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 2001; 105: 69-79Google Scholar). More importantly, the activation of ephrin-B1 reverse signaling inhibits chemoattraction of cerebellar granule cells induced by the chemokine SDF-1, and the inhibition depends on cross-talk between the ephrin-B1 reverse signaling and the G protein-coupled receptor signaling via PDZ-RGS3. Although it is not clear how activation of ephrin-B1 regulated the activity of PDZ-RGS3, it is apparent that the association between ephrin-B1 and PDZ-RGS3 is constitutive and does not depend on activation by EphB2-Fc (25Lu Q. Sun E.E. Klein R.S. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 2001; 105: 69-79Google Scholar). Despite tremendous advance in recent years, details of the reverse signaling of the B ephrins remain largely unclear. One candidate protein that has been identified to interact with the SH3 domain of Grb4 is axin (22Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Google Scholar). Axin is a member of the RGS protein family and acts as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling (26Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Google Scholar). In addition, axin was recently demonstrated to differentially activate the MAP kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (27Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Google Scholar). In view of this finding and the reported regulation of MAP kinase activity by the forward signaling of Eph receptors (28Stein E. Huynh-Do U. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1303-1308Google Scholar, 29Miao H. Wei B.R. Peehl D.M. Li Q. Alexandrou T. Schelling J.R. Rhim J.S. Sedor J.R. Burnett E. Wang B. Nat.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6111-6119Google Scholar), the role of JNK in mediating ephrin-B1 reverse signaling has been investigated. Here we report a novel reverse signaling pathway mediated by ephrin-B1 in 293 cells, which involves activation of JNK via TAK1 and MKK4/MKK7 and leads to a morphological change in the transfected cells. Most surprisingly, this JNK-dependent pathway does not require tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrin-B1. Construction of Plasmids—The full-length cDNA encoding mouse ephrin-B1 was derived from two expressed sequence tag clones (GenBank™ accession number AI131834 and AA003279). The full-length cDNA for mouse Grb4 was from a mouse expressed sequence tag clone (image.3648783) and was Myc epitope-tagged. Both ephrin-B1 and Grb4 were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5. Point mutations of ephrin-B1 and Grb4 were generated by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Grb4 dominant-negative constructs were designed as described (32Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Google Scholar). Deletion mutants were achieved by PCR-based mutagenesis. In general, to avoid unwanted mutations resulting from PCR reactions, we fused only small fragments encompassing the mutated area to wild-type DNA fragments. All PCR amplified DNA products were verified by sequencing. Expression vectors for HA-MEKK1-C-K/M, HA-ASK-K709R, HA-TAK1-K63W, MKK4-DN, MKK7-DN, and FLAG-tagged JNK were as described as previously (27Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Google Scholar). Myc-PAK H82,86L was a gift from Dr. J. Han (the Scripps Research Institute). Transient Transfection and Immunokinase Assays—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU of penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Transfections were performed in 60-mm dishes using Dosper liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 4 μg with the empty vector pCMV5 where necessary. Cells were harvested at 40 h after transfection and lysed as described previously (27Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged JNK1 was immunoprecipitated using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma), and the JNK activity was determined as described previously using 1 μg of GST-c-Jun- (1–79) (Stratagene) as substrate followed by Western blotting using Phospho-c-Jun antibody (Cell Signaling Inc.) to examine the phosphorylation of c-Jun (27Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Google Scholar). Fold activation of the kinase was determined by an imaging analyzer (Amersham Biosciences model 425E) and normalized to their expression levels. Data are expressed as fold kinase activation compared with that in vector-transfected cells, with the values representing the mean ± S.D. from at least three separate experiments. Transfected 293T cells were stimulated for2hby EphB2-Fc (7 μg/ml, R&D Systems, Inc.) pre-clustered by anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) as described previously (22Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Transiently transfected 293T cells in 60-mm dishes were lysed in lysis buffer, sonicated three times for 5 s each, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Ephrin-B1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with anti-ephrin-B1 antibody (sc-910, Santa Cruz Biotechnology., Inc.) and protein A/G Plus-agarose beads and eluted with SDS sample buffer. The boiled samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, the membranes were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10, Upstate Biotech.). The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with anti-ephrin-B1 antibody. Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Staining of 293 Cells by Ephrin- and Eph-Fc Chimeric Proteins—293 cells were stained by ephrin-B1-Fc, EphB2-Fc (R&D Systems, Inc.) or Fc fragment of Human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) as described previously (33Lai K.O. Ip F.C.F. Ip N.Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 265-269Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml chimeric proteins in PBS plus 10% calf serum for 30 min. After washing three times by PBS plus 10% calf serum, the cells were fixed by methanol for 2 min followed by rehydration with PBS. After heating at 70 °C for 30 min, the cells were incubated with anti-human antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Promega) for 1 h. The cells were then washed three times by PBS and incubated with the phosphatase inhibitor levamisole (1 mm, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in AP buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) for 5 min before the addition of the AP substrates nitro blue tetrazolium (4.4 μl/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (3.3 μl/ml, Invitrogen). Morphological Assay of Transfected 293 Cells—293 cells in 35-mm dishes were co-transfected with 1 μg of GFP and 3 μg of pCMV5, FLAG-JNK1, or various ephrin-B1 constructs by calcium phosphate precipitation. The cells were washed three times in PBS on the next day, and the cell morphology was examined 5 h later under fluorescence microscope. To examine the effects of inhibitors, the cells were washed three times in PBS on the next day after transfection and then incubated with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (30 μm, Calbiochem), the Src inhibitor PP2 (1, 10, or 25 μm, Calbiochem), or Me2SO for 2–5 h before examination of the cell morphology. To quantify the results, the number of flattened and rounded cells that were GFP-positive was counted in eight different fields randomly chosen from each dish. The results from three independent experiments were analyzed (mean ± S.E., n = 3). Activation of JNK by Ephrin-B1 Requires TAK1, MKK4, and MKK7—To examine whether ephrin-B1 reverse signaling could activate JNK, 293T cells were co-transfected with ephrin-B1 and FLAG-JNK1. The kinase activity of JNK was assessed by phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun following immunoprecipitation. Although low levels of FLAG-JNK activity were observed in 293T cells co-transfected with vector alone, exogenous expression of ephrin-B1 resulted in a robust increase in JNK activity (Fig. 1A). JNK activity was not further elevated in the presence of exogenous EphB2-Fc chimeric protein. One possible explanation for the lack of a requirement for exogenous EphB2-Fc is that 293T cells express endogenous EphB receptors, which interact with the exogenous ephrin-B1, leading to the activation of JNK. Indeed, 293 cells could be positively stained by ephrin-B1-Fc, indicating endogenous expression of EphB receptors (Fig. 1B). Alternatively, over-expressed ephrin-B1 may spontaneously form dimers and transduce reverse signaling. Several MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAP3K) have been shown to activate the JNK pathway (34Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar, 35Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Google Scholar, 36Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Google Scholar). To investigate whether and if so which of the upstream MAP3Ks was responsible for ephrin-B1-mediated JNK activation, dominant-negative constructs of different MAP3K, as well as the p21-activated kinase (PAK), were co-transfected with ephrin-B1 in 293T cells. Over-expression of the dominant-negative constructs alone did not affect the JNK activity (Fig. 1C, open bars), and over-expression of dominant-negative MEKK1, ASK1, or PAK also did not affect ephrin-B1-induced JNK activation (Fig. 1C, solid bars). However, co-expression of dominant-negative TAK1 significantly reduced ephrin-B1-induced JNK activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C and D). JNK is phosphorylated and becomes activated by MKK4 and MKK7, two MAP kinase kinases downstream of MAP3K (34Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar, 35Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Google Scholar, 36Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Google Scholar). To examine their possible role in mediating ephrin-B1-induced JNK activation, dominant-negative MKK4 and MKK7 were co-transfected separately with ephrin-B1 in 293T cells. Both dominant-negative MKK4 and MKK7 could partially inhibit the ephrin-B1-induced JNK activation (Fig. 1E). These data demonstrate that exogenous expression of ephrin-B1 in 293T cells leads to activation of JNK via TAK1 and MKK4/MKK7. Activation of JNK by Ephrin-B1 Was Dependent on Reverse Signaling but Independent of Ephrin-B1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Because of the endogenous expression of EphB receptors in 293T cells, the increase in JNK activity upon over-expression of ephrin-B1 could be attributed to both forward and reverse signaling. To verify their relative significance, the JNK activity was compared between over-expression of wild-type ephrin-B1 and a truncated ephrin-B1 in which the transmembrane domain was retained but the entire cytoplasmic domain of 82 amino acids was deleted (ephrin-B1/ΔC82). The expression of ephrin-B1/ΔC82 could not be verified by Western blotting with anti-ephrin-B1 antibody, because the antibody recognized an epitope near the carboxyl terminus of ephrin-B1. However, staining with EphB2-Fc chimera showed that both ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B1/ΔC82 were expressed and targeted to the membrane (Fig. 2B). The reverse signaling-defective ephrin-B1 drastically lost the ability to activate JNK (Fig. 2A), indicating that JNK activation was attributable for the most part to the reverse signaling. The carboxyl-terminal 33 amino acids are virtually identical among the three ephrin-B ligands, and these include the five conserved tyrosine residues and the PDZ-binding motif (19Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Mbamalu G. Yancopoulos G.D. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 722-725Google Scholar). To investigate the significance of the carboxyl-terminal 33 amino acids, a truncated ephrin-B1 that lacked the carboxyl terminus (ephrin-B1/ΔC33) was transfected into 293T cells. Over-expression of ephrin-B1/ΔC33 induced significant JNK activity compared with empty vector or ephrin-B1/ΔC82, although the activation was lower than that induced by wild-type ephrin-B1 (Fig. 2A). Staining with EphB2-Fc chimera showed that ephrin-B1/ΔC33 was expressed and targeted to the membrane, similar to the full-length ephrin-B1 (Fig. 2B). This surprising finding suggests that truncated ephrin-B1 that lacks the intracellular tyrosine residues and the PDZ-binding motif can still transduce reverse signaling to activate JNK. Tyrosine residues 312, 317, and 331 of chicken ephrin-B1 were identified as the major phosphorylation sites (37Kalo M.S. Yu H.H. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38940-38948Google Scholar). To further address the role of ephrin-B1 tyrosine phosphorylation in JNK activation, the six intracellular tyrosine residues of ephrin-B1 were singly or multiply substituted by phenylalanine (Tyr to Phe substitutions). Transfection of these mutated constructs into 293T cells induced robust JNK activation (Fig. 2, C and D). In particular, ephrin-B1 in which all six tyrosine residues were substituted (ephrin-B1/6YF) could activate JNK to an extent similar to that of wild-type ephrin-B1. Grb4 is an SH2 domain adaptor molecule that has been identified as interacting with the activated ephrin-B1 that harbors phosphotyrosine residues, leading to downstream cytoskeletal reorganization (22Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Google Scholar). The role of Grb4 in mediating ephrin-B1-induced JNK activation in 293T cells was therefore investigated. Over-expression of Grb4 alone did not increase the JNK activity, and the ephrin-B1-induced JNK activity was not affected by co-expression of Grb4 (Fig. 3A). Similarly, over-expression of different dominant-negative Grb4, which contained single or multiple substitutions of tryptophan or arginine by lysine, could not inhibit the ephrin-B1 induced JNK activity (Fig. 3B). These observations suggest that the recruitment of Grb4 is not involved in the ephrin-B1-induced JNK activation, which is consistent with the findings that over-expression of ephrin-B1/6YF can effectively activate JNK (Fig. 2D). Ephrin-B1 Was Tryrosine-phosphorylated by Src Kinases upon Over-expression in 293T Cells—The results thus far indicated that exogenous expression of ephrin-B1 in 293T cells could turn on the reverse signaling and induce JNK activity independently of tyrosine phosphorylation. These observations apparently disagreed with the phosphorylation-dependent pathway in which ephrin-B1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by SFK in order to switch on the reverse signaling (21Palmer A. Zimmer M. Erdmann K.S. Eulenburg V. Porthin A. Heumann R. Deutsch U. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Google Scholar, 22Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy is unclear. However, it is possible that the mechanism of ephrin-B1 reverse signaling is cell type-specific, such that the activation of ephrin-B1 in 293T cells does not involve tyrosine phosphorylation by SFK as described in other cell systems. Alternatively, tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrin-B1 by SFK upon activation occurs in 293T cells but is not involved in JNK activation. To distinguish between the two possibilities, tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrin-B1 was examined in transfected 293T cells. Wild-type ephrin-B1, but not mutants in which multiple tyrosine residues were substituted, became tyrosine-phosphorylated when exogenously expressed in 293T cells without the addition of EphB2-Fc (Fig. 4A). Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrin-B1 was abolished when the transfected cells were treated with the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 (Fig. 4B). These results therefore indicate that ephrin-B1, when over-expressed in 293T cells, becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by SFK but that this phosphorylation pathway is not essential for the observed JNK activation. Reverse Signaling of Ephrin-B1 Led to Rounding Morphology of 293 Cells That Was Dependent on JNK Activity but Not Ephrin-B1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation—The biological significance of the JNK pathway in mediating ephrin-B1-induced response was then examined. When 293 cells were co-transfected with ephrin-B1 and GFP, the GFP-positive cells became rounded and shrunk (Fig. 5A), whereas the untransfected cells (GFP-negative) remained spread out and flattened (data not shown). In contrast, when 293 cells were co-transfected with GFP and empty v"

To determine the mechanism of P-gp, it is important to understand how drug binding and subsequent efflux are coupled to ATP hydrolysis. A key step in the reaction cycle is activation of ATP hydrolysis when the drug-binding site is occupied. It is not known whether drug-stimulated ATPase activity requires that the drug-binding site alternate between occupied and unoccupied states or whether ATPase activity is permanently activated when the drug-binding site is permanently occupied. In this study we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and reaction with the thiol-reactive analog of verapamil, MTS-verapamil, to test for the presence of a permanently activated P-gp intermediate.

Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Orthovanadate was prepared from Na3VO4, pH 10 and boiled for 2 min to break down polymeric species before use (28Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Drug transport by P-gp involves the coupling of drug binding with ATP hydrolysis. The transport cycle predicts the existence of an activated intermediate. Therefore, the goal in this study was to determine whether P-gp could be trapped as an activated intermediate if drug substrates could be prevented from leaving the drug-binding site. An approach to keep the drug-binding site occupied would be to permanently attach a drug substrate to a residue in the drug-binding site. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and reaction with a thiol-reactive analog of a drug substrate seemed ideal for these studies. We have done cysteine-scanning mutagenesis on all the residues in the TM segments and found that almost all of the single cysteine mutants were active (16Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A useful thiol-reactive drug substrate is MTS-verapamil (Fig. 1). It is an analog of verapamil and contains an alkylthiosulfonate group that reacts selectively with cysteine residues (29Kenyon G.L. Bruice T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 407-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 30Bruice T.W. Kenyon G.L. J. Protein Chem. 1982; 1: 47-58Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We showed previously that MTS-verapamil is a good substrate of Cys-less P-gp as it stimulated its ATPase activity 10-fold and with a Km of 25 μm (Km for verapamil, 25 μm) (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Accordingly a cysteine was introduced at each position in the predicted TM segments of Cys-less P-gp(His)10. A total of 252 mutants were made, expressed in HEK 293 cells, and then solubilized with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the samples were treated with or without 0.3 mm MTS-verapamil. This concentration of MTS-verapamil caused maximum activation of Cysless P-gp (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). P-gp was then immobilized on a nickel-chelate column, washed with buffer to remove unbound MTS-verapamil, and eluted from the column. The ATPase activities of the P-gp treated with and without MTS-verapamil were determined. One mutant, I306C, showed an 8-fold increase in ATPase activity after treatment with MTS-verapamil. Activation by MTS-verapamil was concentration-dependent. Fig. 1 shows that maximal stimulation occurred after treatment of mutant I306C with 0.1–1 mm MTS-verapamil, and half-maximal stimulation was 39 μm. Nickel-chelate chromatography was effective in removing unreacted MTS-verapamil because the activity of Cys-less P-gp remained at basal levels even after pretreatment with 1 mm MTS-verapamil (Fig. 1). To test whether all of mutant I306C had been modified by MTS-verapamil, we assayed for stimulation or inhibition of the ATPase activity by other drug substrates. The rationale is that if a significant amount of unmodified mutant I306C is present, then the presence of other substrates or inhibitors should affect the activity of the mutant. We tested compounds that are potent stimulators (calcein-AM, demecolcine, vinblastine, and verapamil) (17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Fig. 2 shows the effect of various stimulators and inhibitors on the ATPase activity of mutant I306C before and after treatment with MTS-verapamil. Before treatment with MTS-verapamil, the ATPase activity of mutant I306C was stimulated by demecolcine, calcein-AM, verapamil, and vinblastine by 11.9-, 9.8-, 7-, and 3-fold, respectively. By contrast, cyclosporin A and trans-(E)-flupentixol inhibited the ATPase activity (0.9- and 0.5-fold, respectively). When mutant I306C was pretreated with MTS-verapamil, the presence of other stimulators or inhibitors of P-gp had little effect on its ATPase activity (7.7–8.1-fold versus 8-fold increase) (Fig. 2). This inability to further stimulate or inhibit the activity of the MTS-verapamil-treated mutant I306C suggests that most (more than 90%) of the mutant I306C P-gp was modified and that covalent attachment of verapamil in the drug-binding site blocks access of other drug substrates to the drug-binding site. It was possible that reaction of the mutant with MTS-verapamil partially denatured the protein so that the ATP-binding sites are uncoupled from the drug-binding sites. If modified I306C retained a “native” structure, then it should be possible to restore basal levels of ATPase activity if covalent attachment of MTS-verapamil was removed. Accordingly modified I306C was treated with 20 mm dithiothreitol to reduce the disulfide bond between P-gp and MTS-verapamil, and then P-gp was reisolated by nickel-chelate chromatography. Fig. 3 shows that reduction of the disulfide bond by dithiothreitol reduced the activity of the mutant as its ATPase activity was only slightly higher (1.5-fold) than the untreated I306C mutant. Mutant I306C remained active after removal of the covalently bound MTS-verapamil since it retained the ability to be stimulated by verapamil (6.9-fold). The characteristics of the ATPase activity of modified I306C mutant were also examined. We tested for vanadate trapping of nucleotide. P-gp traps nucleotides in the presence of vanadate plus Mg-ATP and results in the formation of an inhibitory transition state that inhibits ATP hydrolysis at the second ATP site (36Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that mutant I306C that had been labeled with MTS-verapamil was still inhibited by vanadate. In addition, the modified mutant I306C had a Km for ATP (1.1 mm) that was very similar to that of Cys-less P-gp (1 mm) (data not shown). If MTS-verapamil occupied the drug-binding site in mutant I306C, then pretreatment of the mutant with other drug substrates should protect it from labeling by MTS-verapamil if they shared a common drug-binding site. Accordingly mutant I306C was treated with or without the drug substrates calcein-AM, demecolcine, verapamil, vinblastine, cyclosporin A, or colchicine before treatment with MTS-verapamil for 10 min at 22 °C. P-gp was isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography, and ATPase activity was determined. Fig. 4 shows that all of the drug substrates protected mutant I306C from labeling with MTS-verapamil since they prevented modification and activation of I306C by MTS-verapamil by 70–85%. These results suggest that the compounds tested likely share a common drug-binding site. Treatment of mutant I306C with MTS-verapamil followed by removal of unreacted MTS-verapamil caused the mutant to remain in an activated state. ATP is constantly hydrolyzed at a high rate without concomitant transport, i.e. ATP hydrolysis is uncoupled from vectorial transport. Addition of other stimulators or inhibitors of P-gp could not change the ATPase activity of the activated mutant. An explanation for this observation is that covalent attachment of MTS-verapamil to the cysteine residue at position 306 in TM5 resulted in the permanent occupation of the drug-binding site in an orientation similar to that of P-gp with unmodified verapamil. Evidence that MTS-verapamil tethered to I306C mimics the interaction of the mutant with verapamil is that both verapamil and MTS-verapamil caused similar activation of ATPase activity (7–8-fold). In addition, activation of I306C by MTS-verapamil was reversed by dithiothreitol, and the dithiothreitol-treated mutant could rebind verapamil. Both MTS-verapamil and verapamil must bind to the same drug-binding site because the activity of MTS-verapamil-treated I306C was not affected by verapamil or other stimulators and inhibitors of P-gp, and mutant I306C can be protected from labeling by verapamil and the other substrates and inhibitors. A model to explain the activated state of P-gp is shown in Fig. 5. In the resting state (state I), P-gp can bind ATP with normal affinity, but ATPase activity is low because the opposing signature “LSGGQ” motifs are farther away from the Walker A sites in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (33Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 37Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Binding of verapamil in the TM segments induces conformation changes in the NBDs to bring the LSGGQ and Walker A sequences closer (state II) and promote ATP hydrolysis (38Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13603-13606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 39Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis then changes the conformation of the TM segments (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 40Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) leading to drug release (state III). Expulsion of verapamil from the drug-binding site allows the LSGGQ and Walker A sequences to move apart, and P-gp returns to the resting state (state IV) (41Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 42Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Covalent attachment of verapamil, however, results in the permanent occupation of the drug-binding site (state IIA). The inability of MTS-verapamil to exit the activated state keeps the LSGGQ and Walker A sequences close together and in a conformation that ensures continued hydrolysis of ATP and recycling between states IIA and IIIA (Fig. 5, dotted arrow). It is possible that Ile-306 may be part of the mechanism that senses that the drug-binding site is occupied and then initiates conformational changes in the molecule. Our model predicts that covalent modification of the drug-binding site can result in permanent activation of ATP hydrolysis in the absence of transport because hydrolysis of ATP and release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) occurs before vectorial displacement of the drug ligand. In this respect, ATP-binding cassette transporters appear to be different from the P-type ATPases such as the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) Ca-ATPase. In the P-type ATPases, ATP hydrolysis is linked to conformational changes in the calcium-binding site, but Pi is not released until after vectorial transport of calcium (43Inesi G. Sumbilla C. Kirtley M.E. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 44Chen L. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Zhong L. Strock C. Kirtley M.E. Inesi G. J. Biol.

This study also shows that TM5 must contribute residues to the drug-binding site since other substrates and inhibitors could protect I306C from labeling by MTS-verapamil. We had predicted that I306C likely lined the drug-binding site because it could be cross-linked to other cysteines in TMs 10, 11, and 12 with thiol-reactive cross-linker substrates (20Loo T.W.

https://openalex.org/W2023391260,"Adaptor protein 3BP2, a c-Abl-Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding protein, is known to play a regulatory role in T-cell receptor-mediated transcriptional activation of nuclear factor of activated T cell and activator protein 1 by interacting with Syk/ZAP-70 protein-tyrosine kinase. We have previously demonstrated that aggregation of high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2, and overexpression of the 3BP2-SH2 domain suppresses antigen-induced degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 mast cell line. In this report, we attempt to analyze the biological relevance of 3BP2 tyrosine phosphorylation. By using the transient expression system in COS-7 cells, we have demonstrated that 3BP2 was predominantly phosphorylated on Tyr174, Tyr183, and Tyr446 when it was coexpressed with Syk. An in vitro binding study revealed that phosphorylation of Tyr446 by Syk was likely to create a binding site for the Lyn-SH2 domain in RBL-2H3 cells. In addition, proline-rich region of 3BP2 bound to the Lyn-SH3 domain. Conformational microscopic analysis showed that Lyn and 3BP2 are constitutively colocalized in RBL-2H3 cells. Overexpression of 3BP2 in RBL-2H3 cells resulted in an enhancement of Lyn autophosphorylation. These results suggest that the adaptor protein 3BP2 is a potential regulator of Lyn protein-tyrosine kinase as a ligand of its SH3/SH2 domains in FcϵRI-mediated signaling in mast cells.

Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Google Scholar). 3BP2 was also identified as a Syk kinase-interacting protein by the yeast two-hybrid screening (2Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of 3BP2 resulted in a transcriptional activation of nuclear factor of activated T cell and activator protein 1, which is induced by T-cell receptor aggregation. Ser225 and Ser277 of 3BP2 were identified as essential sites for interacting with 14-3-3 to negatively regulate the function of 3BP2 in lymphocytes (3Foucault I. Liu Y.C. Bernard A. Deckert M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7146-7153Google Scholar). Moreover, infection of 3BP2 wild type into NK cells by vaccinia virus enhanced cell cytotoxicity. An in vitro binding study suggested that phosphorylation of Tyr183 of 3BP2 could be associated with Vav and phospholipase C-γ (4Jevremovic D. Billadeau D.D. Schoon R.A. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7219-7228Google Scholar). In mast cells, overexpression of the 3BP2-SH2 domain suppressed high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI)-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ, Ca2+ mobilization, and degranulation (5Sada K. Miah S.M.S. Maeno K. Kyo S. Qu X. Yamamura H. Blood. 2002; 100: 2138-2144Google Scholar). These findings have demonstrated that 3BP2 plays a critical role in hematopoietic cells. To propagate the immunoreceptor signal, adaptor proteins contribute to protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions through multiple domains and/or specific phosphotyrosine-containing sequences. Tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 was observed in NK cells and mast cells by cross-linking FcγR and FcϵRI, respectively (4Jevremovic D. Billadeau D.D. Schoon R.A. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7219-7228Google Scholar, 5Sada K. Miah S.M.S. Maeno K. Kyo S. Qu X. Yamamura H. Blood. 2002; 100: 2138-2144Google Scholar). To elucidate the function of 3BP2, it is necessary to determine the protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) that phosphorylates 3BP2 and its binding partner to assemble a signaling complex through specific phosphotyrosine-containing motifs in 3BP2. The Src family PTK Lyn is associated with FcϵRIβ. Upon aggregation of FcϵRI, Lyn is critical for phosphorylating FcϵRIβ and -γ subunits on Tyr residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM) (6Paolini R. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Google Scholar, 7Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Google Scholar, 8Jouvin M.H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Google Scholar). By analogy with studies on Hck, Lyn is thought to be activated by the disassembly of the closed intramolecular interaction by (i) CD45-mediated dephosphorylation of C-terminal regulatory Tyr residue, (ii) binding to SH3 and SH2 ligands, and (iii) autophosphorylation of Tyr in the activation loop (9Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Google Scholar). What is the binding ligand of the SH3 and SH2 domains of Lyn in FcϵRI signaling pathway? Pull-down experiments using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Lyn-SH2 fusion protein indicated that there were multiple phosphoproteins interacting with the Lyn-SH2 after the antigen stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells (10Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Google Scholar). In addition, although the displacement of intramolecular SH3 interaction is not well understood, it seems likely that some aggregation-induced change in an associated molecule provides a higher affinity SH3 ligand that binds to the Lyn-SH3 domain (11Turner H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1999; 402: B24-B30Google Scholar). The SH3 domain is directed toward the proline-rich region, but such a ligand has not been identified yet in the FcϵRI signaling. We isolated nonreceptor type PTK Syk from porcine spleen (12Taniguchi T. Kobayashi T. Kondo J. Takahashi K. Nakamura H. Suzuki J. Nagai K. Yamada T. Nakamura S. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15790-15796Google Scholar). Syk is expressed in hematopoietic, epithelial, and endothelial cells (13Turner M. Schweighoffer E. Colucci F. Di Santo J.P. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 148-154Google Scholar, 14Sada K. Takano T. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 177-186Google Scholar, 15Coopman P.J. Do M.T. Barth M. Bowden E.T. Hayes A.J.

Blood. 2001; 98: 2869-2871Google Scholar). When the ITAM of FcϵRIγ subunits is phosphorylated by Lyn, Syk is recruited to the plasma membrane by binding its tandem SH2 domain and is autophosphorylated (17Siraganian R.P. Zhang J. Suzuki K. Sada K. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1229-1233Google Scholar). Syk has multiple autophosphorylation sites. Tyr317, Tyr342, and Tyr346 are located in the linker region of Syk; Tyr519 and Tyr520 are in the activation loop of the kinase domain; and Tyr624 and Tyr625 are in the C-terminal region (18Furlong M.T. Mahrenholz A.M. Kim K.H. Ashendel C.L. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 177-190Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr519 and Tyr520 is critical for the enzymatic activation of Syk (19Zhang J. Billingsley M.L. Kincaid R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35442-35447Google Scholar). Another member of the Syk family PTKs, ZAP-70, has a similar structural feature. However, there are differences in the binding molecules and mechanism of enzymatic activation between Syk and ZAP-70 (13Turner M. Schweighoffer E. Colucci F. Di Santo J.P. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 148-154Google Scholar, 14Sada K. Takano T. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 177-186Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that Tyr174, Tyr183, and Tyr446 on 3BP2 are phosphorylated by a nonreceptor type PTK, Syk. Phosphorylation of 3BP2 on Tyr446 creates a binding site for the Lyn-SH2 domain in vitro. Additional interaction between the proline-rich region and Lyn-SH3 may contribute to the constitutive codistribution of both molecules in RBL-2H3 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of 3BP2 resulted in an enhancement of antigen-induced Lyn autophosphorylation in RBL-2H3 cells. On the other hand, overexpression of 3BP2-SH2 resulted in a suppression of Lyn autophosphorylation. Our results suggest that 3BP2 is a potential ligand of Lyn-SH3/SH2 domains that positively regulates the autophosphorylation of Lyn in mast cells. Here, we are proposing the model of a novel Lyn-activating cycle in mast cells.

Construction of cDNA—The HA-tagged expression construct of mouse 3BP2 in pMT3 vector (pMT3-HA-3BP2) was kindly provided by Dr. A. Altman (La Jolla Institute).

The loss of function mutation of the 3BP2-SH2 domain (Arg486 → Lys) was described previously (5Sada K. Miah S.M.S. Maeno K. Kyo S. Qu X. Yamamura H. Blood. 2002; 100: 2138-2144Google Scholar). A loss-of-association mutation (deletion of proline-rich region plus Y446F mutation) was created by PCR. The wild type and mutations of 3BP2 used in this study were shown in Fig. 1, A and B. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression constructs of porcine Syk wild-type, kinase-inactive mutation (Lys396 → Arg) and SH2 domain deletion mutation that lacks two SH2 domains and interdomain A (Phe10–Ala272) (Syk-ΔSH2) were described previously (20Sada K. Minami Y. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 827-833Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding Lyn, HA-focal adhesion kinase (gifts from Dr. R. P. Siraganian, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and CAKβ/Pyk2 (gift from Dr. T. Sasaki, Sapporo Medical University) were subcloned into pSVL expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). pApuro-T7-tagged Btk was gift from Dr. T. Kurosaki (Kansai Medical University, Japan), and cDNA encoding human Syk was from Dr. B. Mueller-Hilke (Deutsches RheumaForschungs-Zentrum) and subcloned into pApuro expression vector. Cell Culture, Transfection of cDNA, and Cell Activation—Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells and COS-7 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in DMEM (Sigma) with 100 units/ml of penicillin and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. HA-3BP2 wild type (WT) cDNA was stably transfected into RBL-2H3 cells by the LacSwitch II inducible mammalian expression system (Stratagene). Briefly, 40 μg of XmnI-cleaved LacI repressor-expressing vector (pCMVLacI) was transfected into 5 × 106 cells by electroporation (950 microfarads, 310 V) using Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). Cells resistant to 0.7 mg/ml of hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science) were screened by the level of LacI repressor protein expression by immunoblotting of total cell lysates with anti-LacI antibody (Stratagene). The cells expressing the highest level of LacI were used as parental cells for the secondary stable transfection. 40 μg of NheI-digested linearized HA-3BP2-WT cDNA in the operator vector (pOPRSVI/MCS) were transfected into 5 × 106 parental cells by electroporation (950 microfarads, 310 V). Cells were selected with 0.7 mg/ml hygromycin B and 0.2 mg/ml of active G418 (Invitrogen). Cloned lines were screened by the level of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Nacalai, Osaka, Japan)-induced expression of HA-3BP2 using the immunoblotting of total cell lysates with anti-HA antibody. As an internal control, total cell lysates were also analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FcϵRIβ mAb, kindly provided by Dr. R. P. Siraganian. Finally, two positive clones were chosen for further experiments. The cloned lines were preincubated with 1 mm IPTG for 48 h prior to cell activation. The RBL-2H3 cells overexpressing HA-3BP2-SH2 were described previously (5Sada K. Miah S.M.S. Maeno K. Kyo S. Qu X. Yamamura H. Blood. 2002; 100: 2138-2144Google Scholar). For cell activation, RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with anti-DNP IgE (1:5000). Cells were washed once with Tyrode-Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 127 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm LiCl, 5.6 mm glucose, and 0.1% BSA) and then stimulated with 30 ng/ml antigen DNP-BSA in the same buffer for the indicated times. For transient transfection of COS-7 cells, 1 μg of each cDNA and 6 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) were added to 105 cells seeded in a six-well plate, according to the manufacturer's instruction. 48 h after transfection, cells were used for the experiments. Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and solubilized in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were precleared by the centrifugation, and supernatants were incubated with the indicated antibody prebound to protein A-agarose beads. After rotation for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by heat treatment at 100 °C for 5 min with 2× sample buffer. Aliquots of the supernatant of first centrifugation were used as detergent-soluble cell lysates. For immunoblotting, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electronically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45-μm pore size; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with 5% milk in TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Then membranes were washed once with TBST and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies in TBST for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing four times in TBST, the membranes were reacted with appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5000) for 30 min at room temperature and washed extensively four times in TBST. In all blots, proteins were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Pull-down Experiments Using GST Fusion Proteins—The GST-rat Lyn-SH2 domain expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. Reuben P. Siraganian (10Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Google Scholar). The Lyn-SH3 domain was amplified by PCR, using the primer 5′-GGAATTCAGAGGAGCAAGGGGACATTGTG-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCTCGAGCTCTTCGGTTTCTAAGGTGTT-3′ (the restriction enzyme digestion sites are underlined). The Pfu PCR product was subcloned into the pGEX-4T.3 (Amersham Biosciences) to make a domain in-frame with upstream GST. The bacteria cells transformed by GST-fusion protein-expressing constructs were solubilized in Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and the cell lysates were clarified by the centrifugation. Resulting supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer and then washed twice with the binding buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors). RBL-2H3 or COS-7 cells transfected with the different kinds of cDNA were solubilized in the binding buffer. The postnuclear cell lysates were incubated with the indicated GST fusion protein prebound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with the binding buffer, and precipitated proteins were eluted by heat treatment at 100 °C for 5 min with 2× sample buffer. In Vitro Protein Kinase Assay—The washed anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates were incubated in 40 μl of the kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2,4 μm ATP, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) at 30 °C for 5 min. Reactions were terminated by heat treatment at 100 °C for 5 min with 3× sample buffer, and proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was incubated with 1 n KOH for 1 h at 56 °C to remove phosphoserine and most of phosphothreonine. After gel drying, radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography using image analyzer FLA-3000GK (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoprecipitated Lyn were confirmed by the immunoblotting with anti-Lyn antibody. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The RBL-2H3 cells expressing HA-3BP2 were plated onto a coverslip in six-well plates (105 cells/well) and saturated with 1 mm IPTG. After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were sensitized with anti-DNP IgE (1:5000) and further incubated for 24 h (total of 48 h with IPTG) at 37 °C. Cells were washed two times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Then cells were washed four times for 2 min in PBS and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS. For double staining, cells were reacted with rabbit anti-Lyn antibody and anti-HA mAb (Covance, Princeton, NJ) for 1 h, washed three times with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then incubated with the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (green) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (red) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min. After the extensive washing, cells were mounted using SlowFade-Light (Molecular Probes) and analyzed by using confocal imaging system LSM5Pascal (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) (22Mitsui N. Inatome R. Takahashi S. Goshima Y. Yamamura H. Yanagi S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3274-3285Google Scholar). Tyrosine Kinase Syk Phosphorylated Tyr174, Tyr183, and Tyr446 in 3BP2—We previously reported the FcϵRI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein 3BP2 in RBL-2H3 mast cells (5Sada K. Miah S.M.S. Maeno K. Kyo S. Qu X. Yamamura H. Blood. 2002; 100: 2138-2144Google Scholar). 3BP2 is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated and reached a peak 1 min after stimulation, suggesting that proximal nonreceptor type PTKs may contribute to tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2. In COS-7 cells, 3BP2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by Syk, Lyn, or Btk among PTKs known to be activated after FcϵRI aggregation in mast cells (Fig. 1C). In particular, 3BP2 was predominantly phosphorylated by Syk, which is known to play an essential role in B-cell development and Fc receptor-mediated activation of hematopoietic cells (13Turner M. Schweighoffer E. Colucci F. Di Santo J.P. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 148-154Google Scholar, 14Sada K. Takano T. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 177-186Google Scholar). Based on this finding, we attempted to identify the tyrosine residues in 3BP2 phosphorylated by Syk. Previously, the phage display study showed that Syk prefers the Asp-Tyr-Glu (DYE) sequence in its substrate (23Schmitz R. Baumann G. Gram H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 664-677Google Scholar). 3BP2 has two tyrosines, Tyr174 and Tyr446, located in the DYE sequence (Fig. 1A). In addition, an in vitro binding study suggested that phosphorylation of Tyr183 located in Tyr-X-X-Pro motif creates a binding site for the Vav-SH2 domain (Fig. 1A) (4Jevremovic D. Billadeau D.D. Schoon R.A. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7219-7228Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated a series of 3BP2 mutations in which each Tyr was substituted to Phe (Fig. 1B). Substitution of all three Tyr residues to Phe (3BP2–3F) abrogated Syk-mediated phosphorylation in COS-7 cells, suggesting that some of those residues are the phosphorylation sites by Syk (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4). Compared with 3BP2–3F, the 3BP2 mutants in which two Tyr residues were substituted for Phe (174Y, 183Y, and 446Y) were tyrosine-phosphorylated by Syk in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 5–7). This indicates that Syk phosphorylates all three Tyr residues in 3BP2. The coexpression of 3BP2 with Lyn or Btk resulted in a weak tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 (Fig. 1C). Similar to Syk, Lyn or Btk could phosphorylate Tyr174, Tyr183, and Tyr446 in COS-7 cells (data not shown). Expressions of the individual PTKs and 3BP2 mutants were confirmed by the immunoblotting (Fig. 1, C and D). These results demonstrate that Tyr174, Tyr183, and Tyr446 in 3BP2 are the putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites by nonreceptor type PTKs, in particular Syk. 3BP2-Tyr446 Was a Major Binding Site to the Lyn-SH2 Domain—To examine the role of 3BP2 tyrosine phosphorylation, we utilized the RBL-2H3 cells in which the expression of HA-3BP2 is induced by the addition of IPTG. As we reported previously, aggregation of FcϵRI induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 in RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 2A) (5Sada K. Miah S.M.S. Maeno K. Kyo S. Qu X. Yamamura H. Blood. 2002; 100: 2138-2144Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 3BP2 was visible at 30 s after antigen stimulation and sustained to 10 min. To identify the binding molecule(s) of 3BP2, pull-down experiments were carried out by using various GST-SH2 fusion proteins against mast cells expressing HA-3BP2 (data not shown). Among them, GST-Lyn-SH2 reacted with HA-3BP2 from cell lysates from antigen-stimulated cells, suggesting that antigen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 creates the binding site for Lyn-SH2 in mast cells (Fig. 2B). To examine the mechanism of this interaction, a reconstitution system using COS-7 cells was utilized by transient transfection of cDNA. 3BP2-WT, but not 3BP2–3F, was bound to Lyn-SH2 when it was coexpressed with Syk (Fig. 2C, lane 2 versus lane 4). Phosphorylation of 3BP2 by Lyn could not induce enough interaction with Lyn-SH2 in COS-7 cells, due to the low magnitude of 3BP2 tyrosine phosphorylation as shown in Fig. 1C (Fig. 2C, lane 6). Based on these observations, we then attempted to identify the corresponding Tyr residue(s) that associated with Lyn-SH2 by using this system. The 3BP2-WT, 3BP2–3F, and 3BP2 mutants in which two Tyr residues were substituted for Phe (174Y, 183Y, and 446Y) (Fig. 1B) was cotransfected with Syk, and each cell lysate was incubated with GST-Lyn-SH2 (Fig. 2D). Among three Tyr residues, the binding of 3BP2–446Y for Lyn-SH2 was similar to that of wild type (Fig. 2D, lane 2 versus lane 10). 3BP2–183Y caused a weak binding with Lyn-SH2, and 3BP2–174Y did not associate with Lyn-SH2 (Fig. 2D, lanes 8 and 6, respectively). This result indicates that phosphorylation of Tyr446 by Syk creates binding site for Lyn-SH2. For further confirmation, another pull-down experiment was performed. 3BP2-WT, 3BP2–3F, or 3BP2 mutants in which one Tyr residue was substituted for Phe (Y174F, Y183F, Y446F) (Fig. 1B) was cotransfected with Syk, and each cell lysate was incubated with GST-Lyn-SH2 (Fig. 2E). Compared with the 3BP2-WT, expression of 3BP2 Y446F with Syk resulted in a decreased interaction with Lyn-SH2 (Fig. 2E, lane 2 versus lane 10). A point mutation of Tyr174 or Tyr183 into Phe did not decrease binding with Lyn-SH2 (Fig. 2E, lanes 6 and 8). In the experiments using COS-7 cells, the expression amounts of PTK and the different kinds of 3BP2 were confirmed by the immunoblotting of cell lysates (Fig. 2, C–E, right panel). Therefore, these results suggest that antigen stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2, causing the interaction with Lyn. Moreover, among three putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites in 3BP2, phosphorylation of Tyr446 seemed to be the major site contributing to the interaction with Lyn-SH2 upon FcϵRI aggregation in mast cells. Phosphorylation of Tyr446 but Not the SH2 Domain of 3BP2 Contributed to the Interaction of Lyn with Syk—GST-Lyn-SH2 binds to Syk in antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 mast cells (10Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Google Scholar). A pull-down experiment demonstrated that Syk was precipitated with GST-Lyn-SH2 when it was coexpressed with 3BP2-WT in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Kinase-inactive form of Syk was poorly precipitated with Lyn-SH2 (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Also, a point mutation of Tyr446 of 3BP2 caused the same result, suggesting that phosphorylation of Tyr446 of 3BP2 by Syk is required for the full-scale binding of Syk with Lyn-SH2 (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Thus, 3BP2 is necessary for Syk to associate with Lyn-SH2 in COS-7 cells, because Syk alone could not phosphorylate the corresponding Tyr residue to interact with Lyn-SH2, unlike in antigen-stimulated mast cells (Fig. 3A, lane 1) (10Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Google Scholar). Interestingly, a point mutation of Arg486 into Lys in 3BP2-SH2 had no effect on the association with Syk, although 3BP2-SH2 was shown to directly associate with Syk in yeast (Fig. 3A, lane 5) (2Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Google Scholar). Truncation of the SH2 domain of Syk resulted in an increase in the kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk (24Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. Cell Signal. 1995; 7: 185-193Google Scholar). Unlike the wild type, the SH2 domain-truncated form of Syk (Syk-ΔSH2) was capable of associating with Lyn-SH2, independent of 3BP2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). The multiple bands of Syk-ΔSH2 seem to be due to its autophosphorylation, since Syk-ΔSH2 possesses seven putative autophosphorylation sites (Tyr317, Tyr342, Tyr346, Tyr519, Tyr520, Tyr624, and Tyr625) (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2, lower panel) (18Furlong M.T. Mahrenholz A.M. Kim K.H. Ashendel C.L. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 177-190Google Scholar, 25Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C.C. Yankee T.M. Sarac R. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5276-5283Google Scholar). This suggests that Lyn-SH2 could bind to the autophosphorylation site of Syk-ΔSH2 in COS-7 cells. To interact with Lyn-SH2, wild type Syk requires 3BP2; however, Syk with multiple phosphorylation does not require 3BP2. The expression amounts of Syk, 3BP2, and their mutants were confirmed by the immunoblotting of cell lysates (Fig. 3, A and B, right panel). Therefore, these results suggest that 3BP2 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, indirectly or directly. Phosphorylation of Tyr446 is critical for this hypothetical function of 3BP2. Proline-rich Region of 3BP2 Associated with Lyn-SH3 Domain—3BP2 was first isolated as a c-Abl-SH3 domain-binding protein via its proline-rich region (1Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Google Scholar). Also, 3BP2 was capable of binding to SH3 domain of Grb2, Nck, Src, or Fyn (1Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Google Scholar, 2Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Google Scholar). Since we have demonstrated that 3BP2 binds to the Lyn-SH2 domain, we then tested whether the SH3 domain of Lyn could interact with 3BP2. The binding of 3BP2 with the Lyn-SH3 domain was observed when GST-Lyn-SH3 domain reacted with cell lysates from both unstimulated and antigen-stimulated mast cells expressing HA-3BP2 (Fig. 4A). The expression of HA-3BP2 was confirmed by the immunoblotting of cell lysates (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). To examine the mechanism of this interaction, a reconstitution system using COS-7 cells was utilized. Whereas the Lyn-"
https://openalex.org/W2081406386,"Arsenic, which is ubiquitous in the environment and comes from both geochemical and anthropogenic sources, has become a worldwide public health problem. Every organism studied has intrinsic or acquired mechanisms for arsenic detoxification. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae arsenate is detoxified by Acr2p, an arsenate reductase. Acr2p is not a phosphatase but is a homologue of CDC25 phosphatases. It has the HCX5R phosphatase motif but not the glycine-rich phosphate binding motif (GXGXXG) that is found in protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Here we show that creation of a phosphate binding motif through the introduction of glycines at positions 79, 81, and 84 in Acr2p resulted in a gain of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and a loss of arsenate reductase activity. Arsenate likely achieved geochemical abundance only after the atmosphere became oxidizing, creating pressure for the evolution of an arsenate reductase from a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. The ease by which an arsenate reductase can be converted into a protein-tyrosine phosphatase supports this hypothesis.

The ease by which an arsenate reductase can be converted into a protein-tyrosine phosphatase supports this hypothesis. Arsenic is a human carcinogen associated with increased risk of skin, kidney, lung, and bladder cancer (1Abernathy C.O. Liu Y.P. Longfellow D. Aposhian H.V. Beck B. Fowler B. Goyer R. Menzer R. Rossman T. Thompson C. Waalkes M. Environ. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 593-597Google Scholar). Conversely, trivalent arsenicals are used as chemotherapeutic agents against leukemia (2Kwong Y.L. Todd D. Blood. 1997; 89: 3487-3488Google Scholar) and protozoan parasitic diseases such as sleeping sickness (3Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-176Google Scholar). The ubiquity of environmental arsenic from geological formations, fungicides, pesticides, and herbicides has provided selective pressure for the evolution of arsenic-detoxifying systems, which are found in every organism examined. In most organisms arsenate (As(V)) is reduced to arsenite (As(III)), which is removed from the cytosol by a variety of carriers or pumps (4Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110: 745-748Google Scholar, 5Rosen B.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 86-92Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae there are two parallel pathways for arsenite elimination (6Ghosh M. Shen J. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5001-5006Google Scholar). Acr3p is a plasma membrane carrier protein that extrudes arsenite from the cells. Ycf1p is a vacuolar ATPase that catalyzes the sequestration of As(III)-glutathione conjugates in the vacuole. S. cerevisiae Acr2p is the first identified eukaryotic arsenate reductase (7Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ulaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Google Scholar, 8Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 127-136Google Scholar). This 16-kDa enzyme utilizes reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutaredoxin as electron donors to reduce arsenate (As(V)) to arsenite (As(III)), the substrate of the Acr3p and Ycf1p transporters (9Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Google Scholar). It exhibits a low overall similarity to members of the rhodanese/CDC25 family (10Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Google Scholar). Rhodaneses catalyze the transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate to cyanide (11Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P. Lovejoy B. Rocque W.J. Holmes W. Montana V.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Rink M.J. Saper M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 617-625Google Scholar). Acr2p and the CDC25 cell cycle dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSP, dual specificity phosphatase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; FDP, fluorescein diphosphate; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate. share the protein phosphatase active site motif HCX5R (12Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34738-34742Google Scholar, 13Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Google Scholar). Two other families of protein phosphatases also have an HCX5R motif, but they are structurally unrelated to the CDC25 family and may be the result of convergent evolution (12Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34738-34742Google Scholar, 13Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Google Scholar). One family includes the low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). The other family includes a variety of PTPs that have a GXGXXG phosphate-binding loop in their active site (Fig. 1). Because arsenate and phosphate are chemically similar oxyanions, it might be expected that the ancestors of the CDC25 phosphatases and Acr2p had an oxyanion-binding site that could accommodate either oxyanion, and indeed Acr2p is competitively inhibited by phosphate. Nonetheless, Acr2p does not exhibit phosphatase activity (9Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Google Scholar). However, Acr2p lacks the GXGXXG phosphate-binding loop of many PTPs (Fig. 1). In this study the codons for three glycine residues were introduced into the ACR2 gene to create a 79GXGXXG84 sequence in the HCX5R active site. This mutagenesis transformed Acr2p into a PTP at the expense of arsenate reductase activity. We have speculated on the origins of arsenic resistance mechanisms (14Rosen B.P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 207-212Google Scholar). In the primordial neutral atmosphere, arsenic would have been present in solution as As(III) so that resistance would have developed toward arsenite but not arsenate. As the atmosphere became oxidizing, arsenate would have become the predominant form of arsenic in oceans, and there would have been pressure to evolve mechanisms for resistance to the oxidized species. Because reversing the three mutations in the mutated Acr2p obviously would restore this phosphatase to an arsenate reductase, it is reasonable to assume that only a small number of mutations are necessary for an arsenate resistance enzyme to arise from the widespread phosphatases. The clear implication of these results is that the evolution of arsenate resistance is a straightforward process that builds on existing platforms of phosphatases and arsenite transporters. Cell Growth and Acr2p Expression—Cells of Escherichia coli were grown in a low phosphate medium (15Oden K.L. Gladysheva T.B. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 301-306Google Scholar) or Luria-Bertani medium (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at the indicated temperatures supplemented with 50–125 μg/ml ampicillin as appropriate. The phenotype of Acr2p and mutants was determined in E. coli strains W3110 (wild type) or WC3110 (ΔarsC) as described previously (9Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Google Scholar). Overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in low phosphate medium containing various concentrations of sodium arsenate and 0.2% arabinose. Growth (A600) was measured after 48 h of growth at 20 °C. Expression of Acr2p and mutant proteins was determined by immunoblot analysis using anti-His tag antibody as described previously (12Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34738-34742Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations in ACR2 were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene). Plasmid pGEM-T-ACR2 was used for creating the single glycine mutants. For S79G/N81G and S79G/P84G double mutants, plasmids pGEM-T-ACR2N81G and pGEM-T-ACR2P84G were used as templates, respectively, with the same primers used to construct S79G. For N81G/P84G, pGEM-T-ACR2N81G was used as a template with the primers used to create P84G. For the Acr2ptp triple mutant, P84G was used as the template with the same primers used to create S79G/N81G. Each mutation was confirmed by sequencing the entire gene using a CEQ2000 DNA sequencer (Beckman Coulter). The mutagenic oligonucleotides used for both strands and the respective changes introduced (underlined) were as follows: S79G, 5′-CAT TGT ACT GGG GGC AAG AAT AGG GGA CCA AAA GTA GC-3′ and 5′-GC TAC TTT TGG TCC CCT ATT CTT GCC CCC AGT ACA ATG-3′; N81G, 5′-CAT TGT ACT GGG TCC AAG GGT AGG GGA CCA AAA GTA GCT GC-3′ and 5′-GC AGC TAC TTT TGG TCC CCT ACC CTT GGA CCC AGT ACA ATG-3′; P84G, 5′-GGG TCC AAG AAT AGG GGA GGA AAA GTA GCT GCT AAA TTC-3′ and 5′-C GAA TTT AGC AGC TAC TTT TCC TCC CCT ATT CTT GGA CCC-3′; S79G/N81G, 5′-CAT TGT ACT GGG GGC AAG GGT AGG GGA GGA AAA GTA GCT GC-3′ and 5′-GC AGC TAC TTT TCC TCC CCT ACC CTT GCC CCC AGT ACA ATG-3′. Purification and Enzymatic Assays of Acr2p and Mutant Proteins— Acr2p and derivatives were purified and assayed for arsenate reductase activity from cultures of E. coli strain TOP10 bearing pBAD constructs with wild type and mutant ACR2 genes as described previously (9Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity was assayed at 37 °C with 5 μm wild type or mutant proteins using the indicated amounts of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) in 0.1 m MOPS/MES buffer, pH 6.5 (17Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Google Scholar). The assay was initiated by the addition of pNPP, and the rate of hydrolysis was measured from the increase in absorption at 405 nm. Each value was corrected for non-enzymatic pNPP hydrolysis. Enzymes were preincubated with inhibitors for 5 min at 37 °C prior to initiation of the reaction. The data were analyzed with SigmaPlot 2000 using an extinction coefficient for nitrophenol of 18,000 m–1 cm–1. Fluorescein diphosphate (FDP) hydrolysis was measured fluorometrically (18Skorey K. Ly H.D. Kelly J. Hammond M. Ramachandran C. Huang Z. Gresser M.J. Wang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22472-22480Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 37 °C in the same assay buffer with excitation at 475 nm and emission at 515 nm using an SLM-8000C spectrofluorometer with a built-in magnetic stirrer (18Skorey K. Ly H.D. Kelly J. Hammond M. Ramachandran C. Huang Z. Gresser M.J. Wang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22472-22480Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of the peptide LCK505 (TEGQpYQPQP) was measured at 25 °C in a buffer consisting of 50 mm imidazole, pH 6.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm EDTA (18Skorey K. Ly H.D. Kelly J. Hammond M. Ramachandran C. Huang Z. Gresser M.J. Wang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22472-22480Google Scholar). Hydrolysis was assayed either by the change in the absorption spectrum or by the increase in fluorescent intensity resulting from the formation of free tyrosyl peptide with excitation at 275 nm and emission at 305 nm (19Zhang Z.Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Google Scholar). The concentration of enzyme in each assay was 5 μm, and the peptide concentration was 1.5 mm. Arsenate Resistance Phenotype of Acr2p Mutants—Within the active site of PTPs is a consensus sequence, GXGXXG, for a phosphate-binding loop. This motif is not present in the related DSPs that can hydrolyze phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine substrates, nor is it present in the unrelated family of low molecular weight PTPs (20Zhang Z.Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Google Scholar). More pertinently, Acr2p does not have a glycine-rich motif (Fig. 1). To examine whether the lack of phosphatase activity in Acr2p was due to the absence of the three glycine residues at positions 79, 81, and 84, glycine codons were introduced into the ACR2 gene by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutants were constructed encoding single (S79G, N81G, and P84G), double (S79G/N81G, N81G/P84G, and S79G/P84G), and triple (S79G/N81G/P84G, designated Acr2ptp) derivatives of Acr2p. The ability of the mutated genes to confer arsenate resistance in vivo was examined by expression in E. coli strain WC3110, in which the chromosomal arsC gene was deleted, rendering it sensitive to sodium arsenate (Fig. 2) (9Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Google Scholar). Each mutant gene was cloned into E. coli expression vector pBAD-Myc-HisA with a C-terminal His tag. Each of the single glycine mutants was able to confer resistance to arsenate in vivo (Fig. 2A). The double mutants were either inactive or partially active (Fig. 2B). The triple mutant was unable to confer arsenate resistance in vivo (Fig. 2C). The expression of each mutant protein was similar as observed from immunoblots probed with anti-His tag antibody (data not shown). Phosphatase Activity of Purified Acr2p and Glycine Mutants—Wild type Acr2p and each of the glycine mutants were purified by nickel affinity and gel filtration chromatography (9Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Google Scholar) and were examined for phosphatase activity in vitro using pNPP as a substrate (17Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Google Scholar). Only the triple mutant, Acr2ptp, exhibited time-dependent hydrolysis of pNPP (Fig. 3). It is interesting to note that Acr2ptp gained phosphatase activity at the expense of its native arsenate reductase activity (data not shown). To demonstrate that the active site 75HCX5R82 motif of Acr2ptp is required for phosphatase activity, C76A, C76S, and R82A derivatives were constructed. None of the purified mutant proteins exhibited phosphatase activity (data not shown). These results indicate that Acr2ptp utilizes the active site cysteine and arginine residues of the HCX5R motif for pNPP hydrolysis. The rate of pNPP hydrolysis by Acr2ptp as a function of pNPP concentration was determined (Fig. 4A). The Km was calculated to be 1.8 mm, and the Vmax was 1.0 nmol/min/mg of protein. The Km is similar to the reported values for other PTPs such as the human PTP1B (21Guo X.L. Shen K. Wang F. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41014-41022Google Scholar) and the Yersinia Ptp (22Keng Y.F. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 809-814Google Scholar). The turnover number (kcat) for Acr2ptp with pNPP as a substrate is 3.0 × 10–4 s–1, and the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) is 0.17 m–1 s–1. FDP has been used as an alternate substrate to determine phosphatase activity (18Skorey K. Ly H.D. Kelly J. Hammond M. Ramachandran C. Huang Z. Gresser M.J. Wang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22472-22480Google Scholar). Acr2ptp has a Km of 0.15 μm for FDP (Fig. 4B), which is 1200-fold greater affinity than for pNPP. The Vmax was 0.47 μmol/min/mg of protein. The kcat and kcat/Km values were 0.13 s–1 and 0.87 × 106m–1 s–1, respectively. Thus FDP is a much better substrate for Acr2ptp than pNPP. PTP1B also exhibits higher affinity for FDP with a Km of 10 μm (23Wang Q. Scheigetz J. Gilbert M. Snider J. Ramachandran C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 14-23Google Scholar). Inhibitors of Acr2ptp Activity—We have shown previously that phosphate is a competitive inhibitor of Acr2p arsenate reductase activity (9Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Google Scholar). Arsenate also has been shown to be a competitive inhibitor of PTPs (22Keng Y.F. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 809-814Google Scholar, 24Zhang Y.L. Zhang Z.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 139-148Google Scholar). Arsenate competitively inhibited the phosphatase activity of Acr2ptp with a Ki of 1.5 mm (Fig. 5A). Similar Ki values have been obtained for the Yersinia PTP (22Keng Y.F. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 809-814Google Scholar) and human PTP1B (24Zhang Y.L. Zhang Z.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 139-148Google Scholar). Neither sodium arsenite (As(III)) nor sodium sulfate inhibited Acr2ptp activity (data not shown). Sodium phosphate also competitively inhibited Acr2ptp activity with a Ki of 3 mm (Fig. 5B). Sodium orthovanadate, which inhibits other PTPs (25Swarup G. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1104-1109Google Scholar, 26Pathak M.K. Yi T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3391-3397Google Scholar), competitively inhibited Acr2ptp phosphatase activity with a Ki of 120 μm (Fig. 5C) in comparison with a Ki of ∼1 μm for PTP1B (21Guo X.L. Shen K. Wang F. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41014-41022Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that Sb(V) in the form of sodium stibogluconate is a potent inhibitor of PTPs such as SHP-1, SHP-2, and PTP1B (26Pathak M.K. Yi T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3391-3397Google Scholar). However, Sb(V) did not inhibit the DSP mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (26Pathak M.K. Yi T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3391-3397Google Scholar). The effect of Sb(V) in the form of potassium antimonite on the genetically engineered enzyme was examined. Antimonate competitively inhibited Acr2ptp activity with a Ki of 0.5 mm (Fig. 5D). In contrast, antimonite (Sb(III)) did not inhibit Acr2ptp activity (data not shown). This result suggests that Acr2ptp is more similar to PTPs than to DSPs. Acr2ptp Dephosphorylates Phosphotyrosine—Using the phosphotyrosine-containing peptide LCK505 as a PTP substrate (18Skorey K. Ly H.D. Kelly J. Hammond M. Ramachandran C. Huang Z. Gresser M.J. Wang Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22472-22480Google Scholar), the ability of Acr2ptp to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine was examined (Fig. 6). Dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residue alters the absorbance and fluorescence spectra of the peptide, producing a blue shift and a reduction in intensity (19Zhang Z.Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Google Scholar). Acr2ptp-catalyzed hydrolysis of LCK505 produced an increase in absorbance at 282 nm (Fig. 6A) and an increase in tyrosine fluorescence with an associated red shift in the λmax (Fig. 6B). Dephosphorylation of LCK505 with calf intestinal phosphatase produced a similar fluorescence change (Fig. 6B). Structural studies suggest that there are three distinct and unrelated groups of arsenate reductases (4Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110: 745-748Google Scholar). One group includes the E. coli plasmid R773-encoded ArsC, which has a unique fold (27Martin P. DeMel S. Shi J. Gladysheva T. Gatti D.L. Rosen B.P. Edwards B.F. Structure. 2001; 9: 1071-1081Google Scholar) and does not have phosphatase activity. 2R. Mukhopadhyay, Y. Zhou, and B. P. Rosen, unpublished results. A second group includes arsenate reductases found in many Gram-positive bacteria. Even though they also are termed ArsC enzymes, their three-dimensional structures are unrelated to the E. coli enzyme (28Zegers I. Martins J.C. Willem R. Wyns L. Messens J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 843-847Google Scholar, 29Bennett M.S. Guan Z. Laurberg M. Su X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13577-13582Google Scholar). These enzymes belong to the low molecular weight PTP family and catalyze a low rate of hydrolysis of pNPP (28Zegers I. Martins J.C. Willem R. Wyns L. Messens J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 843-847Google Scholar) but have not been shown to have PTP activity. The third group includes the eukaryotic arsenate reductases, such as Acr2p, which has been predicted to have a three-dimensional structure related to rhodaneses and CDC25 DSPs (10Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Google Scholar, 13Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Google Scholar). Although Acr2p has an HCX5R active site similar to that of CDC25 (12Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34738-34742Google Scholar), it does not exhibit measurable phosphatase activity (9Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Google Scholar). In the absence of a three-dimensional structure of Acr2p, our goal was to trace the evolutionary ancestry of this unique arsenate reductase from yeast by strategic mutagenesis. Toward this goal we first aligned Acr2p with the catalytic domains of a variety of PTPs (Fig. 1). The absence of a GXGXXG motif in Acr2p was obvious. Introduction of all three glycines was required to transform the enzyme into a phosphatase. No single or double glycine mutation was sufficient. Both Cys76 and Arg82 of the HCX5R sequence of wild type Acr2p are required for arsenate reduction (12Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34738-34742Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of those residues in the mutant Acr2ptp abolished the acquired phosphatase activity, indicating that the transformed enzyme also utilizes the same catalytic residues and implying mechanistic similarities between arsenate reductases and phosphatases. Acr2ptp utilizes not only pNPP and FDP as substrates but also dephosphorylates the phosphotyrosine residue in the synthetic peptide LCK505. Moreover, PTP inhibitors such as arsenate, antimonate, phosphate, and orthovanadate also inhibit Acr2ptp activity with reasonable Ki values. Thus the acquired PTP activity of the genetically engineered enzyme has many of the key properties of classical PTPs. We hypothesized that the common ancestor of Acr2p and CDC25 could form either a thiol phosphate or a thiol arsenate intermediate. In all phosphatases, an aspartate that is 30–40 residues upstream of the HCX5R active site functions as a general acid base. For example, in mammalian PTP1, Asp181 protonates the leaving group phenolic oxygen to facilitate the removal of the tyrosine substrate from the enzyme-substrate complex (30Li L. Dixon J.E. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 75-84Google Scholar). In the next step Asp181 acts as a general base, abstracting a proton from a water molecule and facilitating hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate (31Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Santoro N. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4568-4575Google Scholar). Acr2p has a corresponding residue, Asp34, which is 40 residues upstream of the active site 75HCX5R82. We predict that the cysteine-phosphate intermediate is positioned for hydrolysis using water as a nucleophile activated by Asp34. We propose that the common ancestor of the rhodanese/CDC25 family and Acr2p was a PTP that had a GXXGXG phosphate-binding loop. The arsenate reductase lineage arose when larger residues were substituted at positions corresponding to 79, 81, and 84 of the present-day Acr2p. This resulted in a loss of flexibility in the catalytic loop that prevented the approach of Asp34. Although the enzyme still could form thiol intermediates with phosphate or arsenate, hydrolysis was lost, and gradual acquisition of arsenate reductase activity occurred under the evolutionary pressure provided by the appearance of environmental arsenate as the atmosphere became oxidizing."
https://openalex.org/W2102421607,"Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a proinflammatory lipid mediator for inflammatory response. It is unclear whether PAF is involved in the very complex process of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced mucosal apoptosis in small intestine. Intestinal I/R was induced in rats intestine by 60 min occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery, followed by a 60 min reperfusion. I/R induced mucosal apoptosis and PAF activity but inhibited PAF-acetylhydrolase activity. Increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and decreases in IL-10 were observed. Western blot analysis showed that I/R induced expressions of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) proteins, cleaved Bid, and enhanced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to activate caspase-9. Pretreatment of PAF antagonist BN-52021 attenuated these changes, except the increase in Fas. The results showed that I/R-inhibited mucosal PAF-acetylhydrolase activity resulted in an increase of activated PAF. The activated PAF increased the mucosal IL-6 and PECAM-1, enhanced the expression of FasL but not Fas, and led to the cleavage of Bid and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to activate caspase-9. This finding suggests that PAF promotes mucosal apoptosis after I/R in the rat small intestine partly through FasL mediating caspase-9 active pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2121861631,"The role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-1 in NF-κB activation by various members of the TNF receptor family is not well understood, and conflicting data have been published. Here, we show that TRAF1 differentially affects TRAF2 recruitment and activation of NF-κB by members of the TNF receptor family. Interestingly, a naturally occurring caspase-derived cleavage product of TRAF1 solely comprising its TRAF domain (TRAF1-(164–416)) acted as a general inhibitor of NF-κB activation. In contrast, a corresponding fragment generated by cleavage of TRAF3 showed no effect in this regard. In accordance with these functional data, TRAF1, but not TRAF3, interacted with the IKK complex via its N-TRAF domain. Endogenous TRAF1 and the overexpressed TRAF domain of TRAF1 were found to be constitutively associated with the IKK complex, whereas endogenous receptor interacting protein was only transiently associated with the IKK complex upon TNF stimulation. Importantly, the caspase-generated TRAF1-fragment, but not TRAF1 itself inhibited IKK activation. Our results suggest that TRAF1 and TRAF1-(164–416) exert their regulatory effects on receptor-induced NF-κB activation not only by modulation of TRAF2 receptor interaction but especially TRAF1-(164–416) also by directly targeting the IKK complex.

TRAF proteins are characterized by a carboxyl-terminal homology domain of about 180 amino acids, named the TRAF domain. Apart from TRAF1, all TRAF proteins show a similar overall architecture in their amino-terminal part: a single RING finger, which is followed by five or seven evenly separated zinc finger motifs (1Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 2Bradley J.R. Pober J.S.

TRAF proteins have been recognized as mediators of NF-κB activation and regulators of cell death, but also as activators of various kinases including ERK, JNK, and IRE1α (1Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 2Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 3Chung J.Y.

The TRAF proteins can interact with a plethora of proteins that play a role in the signaling pathways mentioned above via their TRAF domain. However, in a minority of cases associations can also occur via the amino-terminal ring/zinc finger domain. The carboxyl-terminal part of the TRAF domain allows direct binding to various TNF receptors (1Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 2Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 3Chung J.Y. Park Y.C.

Several lines of evidence, especially analyses of knock-out mice, point to a critical role of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 in TNF receptor and IL1R/Toll receptor-induced activation of JNK and the kinases of the IKK complex (1Wajant H.

The functions of TRAF1 and TRAF3 are rather unknown. With respect to its molecular architecture, TRAF1 is a unique member of the TRAF family.

In accordance with an anti-apoptotic function of TRAF1, transgenic mice that overexpress this molecule showed reduced antigen-induced apoptosis of CD8(+) T-lymphocytes (12Speiser D.E. Lee S.Y.

Besides its anti-apoptotic function, TRAF1 seems to have also anti-proliferative effects as TRAF1(–/–) T-cells exerted stronger proliferation than wild-type T-cells after T-cell receptor or TNF-R2 stimulation (13Tsitsikov E.N.

Although TRAF1 itself does not activate NF-κB upon transient overexpression, it is involved in the regulation of this pathway, possibly due to its interaction with TRAF2. However, the role of TRAF1 in regulation of NF-κB seems to be complex, as some studies found an inhibitory effect of TRAF1 on NF-κB activation whereas others did not (13Tsitsikov E.N. Laouini D.

Remarkably, TRAF1 is transcriptionally up-regulated by NF-κB and could have a role in receptor cross-talk and/or feedback regulation of activated receptor signaling complexes. Moreover, TRAF1 can be cleaved during apoptosis by caspase-8 (18Irmler M. Steiner V. Ruegg C. Wajant H. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Leo E.

The carboxyl-terminal cleavage product of TRAF1 produced thereby comprises only the TRAF domain of the molecule, is still able to interact with TRAF2 and interferes with TNF-induced NF-κB activation (18Irmler M.

Here, we show that TRAF1 and its cleavage product selectively interfere with the recruitment of TRAF2 to some members of the TNF receptor family and demonstrate that the caspase-derived carboxyl-terminal fragment of TRAF1, but not full-length TRAF1, blocks NF-κB activation at the level of the IKK complex. Together, these data reveal that caspase-mediated cleavage converts TRAF1 from a selective modulator of TNF receptor signaling to a general inhibitor of NF-κB activation suggesting that the IKK complex is the target of the NF-κB-inhibitory TRAF1-fragment. Reagents, Cell Lines, and Antibodies—The expression constructs for TRADD, NIK, TRAF2, p50, and p65 were kind gifts from D. Goeddel (Tularik Ink., South San Francisco, CA), D. Wallach (Weizmann Institute of Science), H. Engelmann (University of Munich), A. Israel (Institut Pasteur), and R. M. Schmid (University of Ulm, Germany). HeLa cells and the human T-cell line DII/23–7 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% (HeLa) and 10% (DII/23-7) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Jurkat T-cells and SV80 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Medium for Jurkat T-cells was in addition supplemented with 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. IKKα-GFP and IKKβ-GFP expression constructs have already described elsewhere (20Birbach A. Gold P. Binder B.R. Hofer E. de Martin R. Schmid J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10842-10851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To generate expression constructs encoding TRAF1-GFP, TRAF1-NT-GFP, TRAF1-NTD-GFP, and TRAF1-CTD-GFP, cDNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 1–416 (TRAF1), 1–193 (TRAF1-NT), 184–270 (TRAF1-NTD including a start ATG), and 263–416 (TRAF1-CTD) of TRAF1 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the BglII and SacII sites of pEGFP-N1 (TRAF1, TRAF1-NT, TRAF1-NTD) and pEGFP-C1 (TRAF1-CTD). For this purpose the primers used for PCR amplification contained BglII or BamH1 (compatible with BglII) and SacII restriction sites in their 5′ overhang. TRAF1-TD-GFP was obtained by replacing the death domain of FADD in the pcDNA3-GFP-ΔFADD construct described elsewhere (21Wajant H. Johannes F.J. Haas E. Siemienski K. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Weiss T. Grell M. Scheurich P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) by a TRAF1 cDNA fragment encompassing amino acids 186–416 using BamH1 and NotI. To allow deletion of the FADD part from pcDNA3-GFP-ΔFADD via BamH1 and NotI, a BamH1/BglII hybrid site between the amino-terminal GFP and the carboxyl-terminal FADD part has before restored to a BamH1 site and a BamH1 site present 5′ to the start codon of the fusion protein has been deleted. The IKKγ-GFP encoding expression plasmid was obtained by cloning a PCR fragment containing amino acids 1–419 of IKKγ into the BglII and SacII restriction sites of pEGFP-N1. The expression vector encoding IKKγ-TRADD-(169–312) was obtained from the pEGFP-N1-IKKγ plasmid by replacing the GFP part with a PCR fragment corresponding to amino acids 169–312 of TRADD using the SacII and NotI site of pEGFP-N1. EGFP FACS calibration beads were purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech (Heidelberg, Germany). Induction and Detection of TRAF2 Receptor Complexes—Hela cells which stably express either CD40, CD30, TNF-R2, or a TNF-R2-LTβ fusion receptor were grown on square slides (18 × 18 mm) and transfected with 1.5 μg of a TRAF2-GFP encoding plasmid, using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). After 18 h, HeLa-CD40 cells were stimulated with 300 ng/ml FLAG-tagged CD40L, which was secondarily cross-linked with 1 μg/ml of the FLAG-specific mAb M2. HeLa-CD30 cells were left untreated, since auto-aggregation of CD30 occurred in these cells without requirement of further stimulation. HeLa-TNF-R2 cells and HeLa-TNF-R2-LTβ cells were treated with an agonistic TNF-R2 IgG fraction (2 μg/ml). After one hour cells were fixed, using methanol/acetone (1:1, v/v). Receptor-TRAF2-GFP complexes were visualized by immunofluorescence staining, as described below and analyzed using a Leica IMRE microscope. Slides, which were only examined for expression and localization of GFP fusion proteins were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Luciferase Assay—HEK293 cells (20,000 cells per well of a 96-well plate) were transiently cotransfected with 0.07 ng of a NF-κB luciferase reporter construct, 0.03 ng of a β-galactosidase expression vector and 60 ng of a mixture of the indicated expression constructs, or empty vector with SuperFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 24 h, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using an LUMAT 9501 Luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Transfections were done in triplicates. The absolute values of NF-κB activation were normalized in respect to the β-galactosidase activities, in order to control variations in transfection efficiencies. Coimmunoprecipitation of IKK Complex-associated Proteins and Immunoblotting—For endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments, cells (200 × 106) were treated with the reagents of interest for the indicated times. Then 4 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline were added to arrest the signaling status of the cells. All the following procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Cells were washed one time with phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris, 400 mm NaCl/10% glycerol, pH 7.4 (1 ml per 100 × 106 cells). For cell lysis 0.1 volumes of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and Nonident P-40 to a final concentration of 0.1% were added. After 45 min on ice the lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was divided in two groups, which were incubated under gentle agitation with either 5 μg of anti-IKKα mAb B78-1 (BD Pharmingen, Hamburg, Germany) or the respective control antibody (mouse IgG2b, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) for 2 h. Then 60 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) were added for another hour of incubation. The Sepharose beads were washed four times with low salt buffer (1% Triton, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.1 volumes of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting analysis were performed with the anti-TRAF1 rabbit polyclonal antibody H-125 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), the anti-RIP mAb G322–2 (BD Pharmingen) and the anti-IKKα mAb already used for immunoprecipitation. Visualization was done with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit-IgG, horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse-IgG and NBT and BCIP as substrate. IKK Kinase Assay—HEK293 or Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation with a VSV epitope-tagged IKKβ expression plasmid along with the indicated plasmids. 16–24 h after transfection cells were lysed Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containg 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). VSV-IKKβ containing complexes were immunoprecipitated from 1 mg extract using a VSV specific antibody (clone P5D4; Sigma). The precipitated complex was incubated in kinase assay mixture containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μCi [γ-32ATP], and 600 ng of GST-IκBα substrate. After 20 min (30 °C) the reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Finally, the proteins were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and radioactive bands were visualized by PhosphorImager or autoradiography. The membranes were used for immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for IKKβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7606). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells fixed onto coverglasses were blocked for 20 min with phosphate-buffered saline, 3% bovine serum albumin. HeLa-CD30 cells were treated for 1 h with a CD30-specific monoclonal antibody (0.25 μg/ml). As antibody reagents were used to induce receptor complex formation in the other cell lines, no primary antibodies were applied. Slides were then incubated for 45 min with Alexis 546-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit sera (1:250 diluted) and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Determination of Dissociation and Association Kinetics of TRAF1-GFP and TRAF1-TD-GFP—5 × 105 HeLa cells were electroporated with 3.5 μg of IKKγ-DD, and 6.5 μg of either TRAF1-GFP or TRAF1-TD-GFP expression plasmids and seeded into MATEK cell culture dishes that contained cover glass inlets. Confocal on-line microscopy was performed on an inverted Leica DM microscope. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 during analysis in a preconditioned chamber. Dissociation kinetics were determined by fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP). Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined that excluded IKKγ-DD filaments associated with TRAF1-GFP or TRAF1-TD-GFP, but covered most of the remaining cell area. The ROI of selected cells were bleached for 6 min with high laser intensity and subsequently ROIs were bleached for 1 min, followed by imaging of the entire cell in up to 20 cycles using the time-lapse function of the Leica confocal microscope software. Relative fluorescence intensities in the indicated regions were quantified, using the Leica confocal software. Association kinetics were determined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). In these experiments, ROIs were defined around filaments and bleached for 4 min. Recovery of fluorescence in the bleached areas was analyzed over 15 min whereby cells were imaged every 1 min. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Bait vectors for IKKα (amino acids 272–745), IKKβ (amino acids 466–756) and full-length IKKγ were derived by cloning the corresponding cDNAs in-frame to the Gal4 binding domains of pGBKT7, pAS2–1, and pBRIDGE (BD Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. Vectors encoding human TRAF1 and TRAF3 cDNA fused to the Gal4 activation domain were kindly provided by David Sassoon (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). Two-hybrid analysis were performed in the yeast strain Y187 (BD Clontech). Finally, colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. TRAF1 and Its Caspase-derived Carboxyl-terminal Fragment Differentially Affect NF-κB Activation—Inhibitory, but also stimulatory or neutral effects of TRAF1 on receptor-induced NF-κB activation have been reported (13Tsitsikov E.N.

Med. 2002; 196: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of TRAF1 on NF-κB activation are rather unclear. We have addressed this question by analyzing the impact of TRAF1 on a range of NF-κB-inducing receptors of the TNF receptor family in transient reporter gene assays. As a caspase-generated, truncated form of TRAF1 occurs naturally during apoptosis (18Irmler M. Steiner V. Ruegg C. Wajant H. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Leo E. Deveraux Q.L. Buchholtz C. Welsh K. Matsuzawa S. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8087-8093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we included an expression plasmid encoding this fragment (TRAF1 amino acids 164–416, designated as TRAF1-TD) in our analysis. With exception of a significant inhibitory effect of full-length TRAF1 on CD40-mediated NF-κB activation, we found no evidence for a major inhibitory effect of transient TRAF1 expression on the following NF-κB stimulators: CD30, TNF-R2, LTβR, EDAR, DR3, and TNF-R1 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, overexpression of TRAF1-TD inhibited all of these NF-κB inducers (Fig. 1A). Although it has already been shown elsewhere that the caspase-generated cleavage product of TRAF1 inhibits TNF-mediated NF-κB activation (18Irmler M. Steiner V. Ruegg C. Wajant H. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Leo E. Deveraux Q.L. Buchholtz C. Welsh K. Matsuzawa S. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8087-8093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), our data show further that this TRAF domain comprising fragment of TRAF1 can act as a general inhibitor of NF-κB activation. Reporter gene analysis with GFP fusion proteins of TRAF1 and TRAF1-TD showed the same results (data not shown). FACS analysis of these GFP fusion proteins and EGFP FACS calibration beads revealed that around 50% of successfully transfected cells expressed more than 116,000 molecules of GFP fusion proteins per cell, whereas the rest of the cells expressed between 4000 and 116,000 molecules per cell (Fig. 1B). Endogenous TRAF1 expression of up to 20 fg per cell corresponding to 300,000 molecules per cell was observed upon TRAF1 up-regulation by NF-κB inducers such as TNF (Fig. 1C). As the inhibitory effects on NF-κB activation described above are between 50 and 90%, these data indicate that “physiological” levels of TRAF1-TD and TRAF1 may be sufficient to mediate the effects described above. TRAF1 and Its Caspase-derived Carboxyl-terminal Fragment Inhibit Selectively TRAF2 Recruitment to Sites of CD40 Signaling—We have recently found that the inhibitory effect of TRAF1 on CD40-induced NF-κB activation correlates with an inhibitory effect of TRAF1 on TRAF2 recruitment to sites of CD40 signaling complex formation. 2H. Wajant, F. Henkler, and M. Fotin-Mleczek, manuscript submitted. Although TRAF2 is known to recruit TRAF1 into the CD40 signaling complex, TRAF1 expression also led to an overall reduction of TRAF2 recruitment to ligand-induced CD40 clusters. 2H. Wajant, F. Henkler, and M. Fotin-Mleczek, manuscript submitted. As TRAF1 has also been suggested to be a part of the receptor signaling complexes of CD30 (22Lee S.Y. Park C.G. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 23Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Duckett C.S. Van Dongen J.L. Thompson C.B. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of increasing expression of TRAF1 or TRAF1-(164–416) on TRAF2 recruitment to these receptors. In addition, we analyzed TRAF2 recruitment to the lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR), a member of the TNF receptor family that is believed to signal independently of TRAF1. For this purpose, we determined the recruitment efficiencies of a TRAF2-GFP fusion protein to CD40, CD30, TNF-R2, and to a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 and the cytoplasmic domain of LTβR (TNF-R2ex-LTβRin), using fluorescence microscopy. Stimulation of CD40, TNF-R2, or TNF-R2ex-LTβRin in HeLa cells stably expressing these receptors led to receptor clustering (Ref. 24Fotin-Mleczek M. Henkler F. Samel D. Reichwein M. Hausser A. Parmryd I. Scheurich P. Schmid J.A. Wajant H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2757-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), whereas in HeLa-CD30 cells auto-aggregation of the receptor was observed already without stimulation. Confocal laser microscopy showed that TRAF2-GFP was recruited into small aggregates co-localizing with the induced receptor clusters in consequence of receptor stimulation (Fig. 2A). As no co-localization of TRAF2-GFP with CD40, TNF-R2, or with the TNFR2ex-LTβRin fusion receptor was apparent without stimulation, we used the ligand-induced clustering of TRAF2 and receptors as an early indication of activated receptor signaling and analyzed further, whether TRAF1 expression can interfere with this process. Receptor stimulation led to formation of multiple TRAF2-GFP receptor clusters in the vast majority of cells. To quantify a potential inhibitory effect of TRAF1 on TRAF2-GFP receptor clustering, we determined the proportion of cells with no or less than 5 TRAF2-GFP aggregates per activated cell. Consistent with our earlier observations, we found that the portion of cells, where CD40L-induced TRAF2-GFP aggregate formation occurred, was almost 100% in this assay, when TRAF2-GFP was cotransfected with empty vector. This portion decreased to about 50% when the TRAF2-GFP expression plasmid was co-transfected with a 4-fold excess of TRAF1 expression plasmid (Fig. 2B). In contrast, an excess of TRAF1 showed no effect on the formation of TRAF2-GFP aggregates, neither in TNF-R2ex-LTβRin- and TNF-R2-expressing cells stimulated with an agonistic TNF-R2-specific IgG fraction, nor on the capacity of TRAF2-GFP to co-localize with CD30 clusters resulting from auto-aggregation of this receptor in HeLa-CD30 cells (Fig. 2B). Expression of TRAF1-TD modulated the interactions between activated, clustered receptors and TRAF2-GFP in a similar way as TRAF1 (Fig. 2B). The selective inhibitory effect of TRAF1 on CD40-induced NF-κB activation correlated with the ability of TRAF1 to interfere with the recruitment of TRAF2 to CD40 clusters without affecting TRAF2 recruitment by other receptors. Thus, TRAF1 blocks CD40-mediated NF-κB activation by inhibition of TRAF2 recruitment. However, the general NF-κB inhibitory effect of the caspase-derived carboxyl-terminal TRAF1 cleavage product cannot be related to interference with TRAF2 receptor interactions. Thus, the receptor-selective inhibitory effect of TRAF1 and the global NF-κB inhibitory effect of the caspase-generated TRAF1-(164–416) fragment must be based on different mechanisms. The Caspase-derived Carboxyl-terminal Fragment of TRAF3 Has No NF-κB Inhibitory Capability—While TRAF2, TRAF4, TRAF5, and TRAF6 are not cleaved during apoptosis, TRAF3 has recently been identified as a caspase substrate (Ref. 2"
https://openalex.org/W2024234796,"Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is known to promote both proliferation and differentiation of neural cell progenitors. Using the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE that is induced to proliferate by TGF-alpha, we demonstrated that the expression of a single transcription factor, the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha), can reroute the TGF-alpha mitogenic signaling toward a path leading to differentiation. With selected mutations in ER alpha and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), we demonstrated that the blockade of TGF-alpha mitotic potential was not dependent on ER alpha DNA binding activity but required a transcriptionally active Stat3. In neuroblastoma cells, 17 beta-estradiol treatment induced a transient increase in the transcription of estrogen-responsive element-containing promoters including those regulating TGF-alpha and prothymosin alpha synthesis. Based on the data presented, we hypothesized that in the presence of prothymosin alpha, ER alpha activates its direct target genes and increases cell proliferation, whereas in the presence of high levels of TGF-alpha, ER alpha preferentially interacts with Stat3 and causes cell differentiation. Our results reveal a novel form of ""end-product"" regulation of an intracellular receptor that occurs through recruitment of membrane receptors and their signaling effector system. Cross-coupling between membrane and intracellular receptors has been described by several laboratories. This study proves the relevance of these interactions in cellular responses to growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2102259689,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae URA7-encoded CTP synthetase is phosphorylated and stimulated by protein kinases A and C. Previous studies have revealed that Ser424 is the target site for protein kinase A. Using a purified S424A mutant CTP synthetase enzyme, we examined the effect of Ser424 phosphorylation on protein kinase C phosphorylation. The S424A mutation in CTP synthetase caused a 50% decrease in the phosphorylation of the enzyme by protein kinase C and an 80% decrease in the stimulatory effect on CTP synthetase activity by protein kinase C. The S424A mutation caused increases in the apparent Km values of CTP synthetase and ATP of 20-and 2-fold, respectively, in the protein kinase C reaction. The effect of the S424A mutation on the phosphorylation reaction was dependent on time and protein kinase C concentration. A CTP synthetase synthetic peptide (SLGRKDSHSA) containing Ser424 was a substrate for protein kinase C. Comparison of phosphopeptide maps of the wild type and S424A mutant CTP synthetase enzymes phosphorylated by protein kinases A and C indicated that Ser424 was also a target site for protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of Ser424 accounted for 10% of the total phosphorylation of CTP synthetase by protein kinase C. The incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline into phosphocholine, CDP-choline, and phosphatidylcholine in cells carrying the S424A mutant CTP synthetase enzyme was reduced by 48, 32, and 46%, respectively, when compared with control cells. These data indicated that phosphorylation of Ser424 by protein kinase A or by protein kinase C was required for maximum phosphorylation and stimulation of CTP synthetase and that the phosphorylation of this site played a role in the regulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis by the CDP-choline pathway.

CTP synthetase is an essential enzyme in all organisms. The essential nature of this enzyme emanates from the fact that the product of its reaction CTP is required for the synthesis of nucleic acids and membrane phospholipids (1Stryer L. Biochemistry.

The enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of the amide nitrogen of glutamine to the C-4 position of UTP to form CTP (2Liberman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 765-775Google Scholar, 3Long C.W.

In eukaryotic cells, regulation of CTP synthetase activity plays an important role in the balance of nucleotide pools (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T.

The importance of understanding the regulation of CTP synthetase is further emphasized by the fact that unregulated levels of CTP synthetase activity is a common property of various human cancers (15van den Berg A.A. van Lenthe H.

In yeast, CTP synthetase is encoded by the URA7 (10Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Fasiolo F. Adeline M.-T. Collin J. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 7-16Google Scholar) and URA8 (11Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Google Scholar) genes.

Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24982-24988Google Scholar) and is responsible for the majority of the CTP synthesized in vivo (11Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Google Scholar). Like CTP synthetase from mammalian cells (35Van Kuilenburg A.B. Elzinga L. van Gennip A.H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 431: 255-258Google Scholar), the yeast enzymes are allosterically regulated by their substrates and product CTP (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24982-24988Google Scholar).The S. cerevisiae URA7-encoded CTP synthetase is also regulated by phosphorylation. In vivo, CTP synthetase is phosphorylated on multiple serine residues (36Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that CTP synthetase is a substrate for protein kinase A (37Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28777-28783Google Scholar) and for protein kinase C (36Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar, 38Yang W.-L. Bruno M.E.C. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11113-11119Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, protein kinase A is the principal mediator of signals transmitted through the Ras-cAMP pathway (39Broach J.R. Deschenes R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 79-139Google Scholar, 40Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Google Scholar) whereas protein kinase C is required for the cell cycle (41Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Google Scholar, 42Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar, 43Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Google Scholar, 44Levin D.E. Fields F.O.

J. 1998; 332: 281-292Google Scholar) and plays a role maintaining cell wall integrity (46Levin D.E. Bartlett-Heubusch E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1221-1229Google Scholar). Independently, the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase by protein kinase A (37Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28777-28783Google Scholar) and by protein kinase C (36Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar, 38Yang W.-L. Bruno M.E.C. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11113-11119Google Scholar) results in the stimulation of CTP synthetase activity by a mechanism that increases catalytic turnover and decreases enzyme sensitivity to CTP product inhibition.In this work, we addressed the question of whether the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase by protein kinase A affects the phosphorylation by protein kinase C. Amino acid residue Ser424 has been identified as the target site for protein kinase A phosphorylation in CTP synthetase (47Park T.-S. Ostrander D.B. Pappas A. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8839-8848Google Scholar). Therefore, we utilized a S424A mutant CTP synthetase enzyme for our studies. The S424A mutant enzyme is not phosphorylated in response to the activation of protein kinase A in vivo, and the mutant enzyme is not phosphorylated and stimulated by protein kinase A in vitro (47Park T.-S. Ostrander D.B. Pappas A. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8839-8848Google Scholar). This mutant enzyme exhibits lower catalytic activity and greater sensitivity to CTP product inhibition when compared with the wild type enzyme (47Park T.-S. Ostrander D.B. Pappas A. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8839-8848Google Scholar). These properties are consistent with the effects that protein kinase A phosphorylation has on the activity of wild type CTP synthetase (37Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28777-28783Google Scholar, 47Park T.-S. Ostrander D.B. Pappas A. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8839-8848Google Scholar). We showed here that the S424A mutation reduced the ability of CTP synthetase to be a substrate for protein kinase C. An explanation for this effect was that Ser424 was also a target site for protein kinase C phosphorylation. We also showed that cells bearing the S424A mutant CTP synthetase enzyme exhibited a decrease in the synthesis of the membrane phospholipid PC 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. via the CDP-choline pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals were reagent grade.

Ostrander D.B. Pappas A. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8839-8848Google Scholar). Methods for growth and analysis of yeast were performed as described previously (48Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar, 49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Yeast cultures were grown in complete synthetic medium minus inositol (50Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose at 30 °C. Yeast cell numbers were determined by microscopic examination with a hemacytometer or spectrophotometrically at an absorbance of 600 nm.Purification of Wild Type and S424A Mutant CTP Synthetases— Cells expressing the wild type and S424A mutant CTP synthetases from multicopy plasmids were used for enzyme purification. The enzymes were purified by the method of Yang et al. (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The Sephacryl 300 HR chromatography step was replaced by dialysis and the Superose 6 chromatography step was replaced by Mono Q chromatography. This procedure resulted in the isolation of nearly homogeneous enzyme preparations as evidenced by SDS-PAGE.Enzyme Assays and Protein Determination—CTP synthetase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of UTP to CTP (molar extinction coefficients of 182 and 1520 m–1 cm–1, respectively) by following the increase in absorbance at 291 nm on a recording spectrophotometer (3Long C.W. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4715-4721Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm GTP, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm UTP, and an appropriate dilution of enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Enzyme assays were performed in triplicate with an average standard deviation of ± 3%. All assays were linear with time and protein concentration. A unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of product/min. Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (51Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard.Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE (52Laemmli U.K. Nature (London). 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) was performed with 10% slab gels. Molecular mass standards for electrophoresis were phosphorylase b (92.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa). Proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Immunoblot assays were performed with IgG anti-URA7-encoded (6Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Google Scholar) CTP synthetase antibodies as described previously (53Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Google Scholar). The density of the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase bands on immunoblots was quantified by scanning densitometry. Immunoblot signals were in the linear range of detectability.Phosphorylation Reactions—Phosphorylation reactions were routinely measured for 10 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 40 μl. The indicated concentrations of purified wild type and S424A mutant CTP synthetase enzymes or synthetic peptide were phosphorylated with the indicated concentrations of protein kinase C in a reaction mixture that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.375 mm EDTA, 0.375 mm EGTA, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 20 μm diacylglycerol, 50 μm phosphatidylserine, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 cpm/pmol). CTP synthetase was phosphorylated with protein kinase A (0.2 unit/ml) in a reaction mixture that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 cpm/pmol). Samples containing 32P-labeled CTP synthetase were treated with an equal volume of 4× Laemmli sample buffer (52Laemmli U.K. Nature (London). 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) followed by SDS-PAGE, transfer to PVDF paper, and visualized by phosphorimaging. The extent of phosphorylation was analyzed using ImageQuant software. Phosphorylation signals were in the linear range of detectability. Reactions containing the synthetic peptide were terminated by spotting an aliquot of the reaction mixture onto phosphocellulose filters. The filters were washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid and subjected to scintillation counting. Phosphorylation reactions were performed in triplicate.Tryptic Digestion and Two-dimensional Peptide Mapping—Pieces of PVDF paper containing 32P-labeled CTP synthetase were subjected to digestion with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin and two-dimensional peptide mapping analysis as described by MacDonald and Kent (54MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Google Scholar). Electrophoresis (1% ammonium bicarbonate buffer at 1000 volts for 20 min) and ascending chromatography (n-butyl alcohol/glacial acetic acid/pyridine/water, 10:3:12:15) were performed on cellulose thin-layer glass plates. Dried plates were then subjected to phosphorimaging analysis.Analysis of Phospholipids—Phospholipids were labeled with 32Pi and [methyl-3H]choline as described previously (14McDonough V.M. Buxeda R.J. Bruno M.E.C. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18774-18780Google Scholar, 55Atkinson K. Fogel S. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

Phospholipids were extracted from cells by the method of Bligh and Dyer (57Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) as described previously (58Morlock K.R. Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3561-3566Google Scholar). Phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography using silica gel 60 thin-layer chromatography plates. The solvent systems for dimensions one and two were chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v) and chloroform/methanol/88% formic acid (65:25:10, v/v), respectively (59Esko J.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4474-4480Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled phospholipids were visualized by phosphorimaging analysis. The positions of the labeled lipids on chromatography plates were compared with standard phospholipids after exposure to iodine vapor. The amount of each labeled phospholipid was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the corresponding spots on the chromatograms.Analysis of CDP-choline Pathway Intermediates—Labeling of the CDP-choline pathway intermediates with [methyl-3H]choline was performed as described by McDonough et al. (14McDonough V.M. Buxeda R.J. Bruno M.E.C. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18774-18780Google Scholar). Choline, phosphocholine, and CDP-choline were isolated from whole cells following lipid extraction (57Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The aqueous phase was neutralized and dried in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in deionized water. Samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 12,000 × g to remove insoluble material. The CDP-choline pathway intermediates were separated by thin-layer chromatography with silica gel 60 plates using the solvent system methanol/0.5% sodium chloride/ammonia (50:50:1) (60Teegarden D. Taparowsky E.J. Kent K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6042-6047Google Scholar). The intermediates were detected on chromatograms by fluorography using EN3HANCE and compared with standards. Liquid scintillation counting was used to quantify the amounts of the intermediates.Data Analyses—Kinetic data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the EZ-FIT enzyme kinetic model-fitting program (61Perrella F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed with SigmaPlot 5.0 software.RESULTSEffect of the S424A Mutation on the Phosphorylation and Stimulation of CTP Synthetase by Protein Kinase C—The URA7-encoded CTP synthetase is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (37Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28777-28783Google Scholar) and by protein kinase C (36Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar, 38Yang W.-L. Bruno M.E.C. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11113-11119Google Scholar). Residue Ser424 in the enzyme has been identified as the protein kinase A target site (47Park T.-S. Ostrander D.B. Pappas A. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8839-8848Google Scholar). We questioned whether phosphorylation at Ser424 affects phosphorylation of the enzyme by protein kinase C. Accordingly, we analyzed the phosphorylation of the S424A mutant CTP synthetase by protein kinase C. Protein kinase C was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and various concentrations of the purified S424A mutant and wild type CTP synthetase enzymes. After the phosphorylation reactions, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF paper, followed by phosphorimaging analysis. Protein kinase C activity was dependent on the concentration of both the wild type and mutant forms of CTP synthetase (Fig. 2). The S424A mutation caused a decrease in enzyme phosphorylation at each CTP synthetase concentration (Fig. 2). The apparent Km value for the S424A mutant enzyme (50 μg/ml) was 20-fold higher than that of the wild type enzyme (2.5 μg/ml). The effect of the S424A mutation on the dependence of protein kinase C activity on ATP concentration was also examined (Fig. 3). The extent of CTP synthetase phosphorylation at each ATP concentration was reduced for the S424A mutant enzyme when compared with the wild type enzyme. The apparent Km value for the mutant enzyme (25 μm) was 2-fold higher when compared with the wild type enzyme (Km = 12.5 μm). The phosphorylation reactions using the S424A mutant CTP synthetase as a substrate were performed for different time intervals and with various concentrations of protein kinase C. The phosphorylation of the S424A mutant CTP synthetase by protein kinase C was time-dependent (Fig. 4) and dose-dependent (Fig. 5), but the rate and extent of phosphorylation was reduced by about 50% when compared with the wild type enzyme.Fig. 2Effect of the S424A mutation on the dependence of protein kinase C activity on the concentration of CTP synthetase. The indicated concentrations of the purified wild type (WT) and S424A mutant CTP synthetases were incubated with protein kinase C and [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min. Following the incubations, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF paper. The phosphorylated proteins were subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. Panel A, portions of the images showing the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase are shown. The arrow in the figures denotes the position of CTP synthetase. The position and amounts of the wild type and S424A mutant CTP synthetases on the PVDF papers were confirmed by immunoblot analysis. The data shown are representative of two independent experiments. Panel B, the relative amounts of phosphate incorporated into CTP synthetase were quantified using ImageQuant software where the maximum phosphorylation of the wild type CTP synthetase protein was set as 100.

The purified S424A mutant and wild type CTP synthetase enzymes were phosphorylated with various concentrations of protein kinase C for 10 min. Following the phosphorylation reactions, samples were assayed for CTP synthetase activity using subsaturating concentrations of UTP and ATP. These assay conditions were used to accentuate the effect of phosphorylation on the stimulation of CTP synthetase activity (36Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar, 38Yang W.-L. Bruno M.E.C. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11113-11119Google Scholar). As described previously (36Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Google Scholar, 38Yang W.-L. Bruno M.E.C. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11113-11119Google Scholar), protein kinase C phosphorylation of the wild type enzyme resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of CTP synthetase activity (Fig. 6). The activity of the S424A mutant enzyme was also stimulated by protein kinase C phosphorylation; however, the extent of stimulation was much reduced (Fig. 6). At the highest protein kinase C concentration, the stimulation of CTP synthetase activity was reduced by 80%.Fig. 6Effect of the S424A mutation on the stimulation of CTP synthetase activity by protein kinase C"
https://openalex.org/W2091908376,"Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and is thought to play a role in a variety of inflammatory responses in humans. The metabolism of LTB4in vitro is complex with several competing pathways of biotransformation, but metabolism in vivo, especially for normal human subjects, is poorly understood. As part of a Phase I Clinical Trial of human tolerance to LTB4, four human subjects were injected with 150 nmol/kg LTB4 with one additional subject as placebo control. The urine of the subjects was collected in two separate pools (0–6 and 7–24 h), and aliquots from these urine collections were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography, UV spectroscopy, and negative ion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry for metabolites of LTB4. In the current investigation, 11 different metabolites of LTB4 were identified in the urine from those subjects injected with LTB4, and none were present in the urine from the placebo-injected subject. The unconjugated LTB4 metabolites found in urine were structurally characterized as 18-carboxy-LTB4, 10,11-dihydro-18-carboxy-LTB4, 20-carboxy-LTB4, and 10,11-dihydro-20-carboxy-LTB4. Several glucuronide-conjugated metabolites of LTB4 were characterized including 17-, 18-, 19-, and 20-hydroxy-LTB4, 10-hydroxy-4,6,12-octadecatrienoic acid, LTB4, and 10,11-dihydro-LTB4. The amount of LTB4 glucuronide (16.7–29.4 pmol/ml) and 20-carboxy-LTB4 (18.9–30.6 pmol/ml) present in the urine of subjects injected with LTB4 was determined using an isotope dilution mass spectrometric assay before and after treatment of the urine samples with β-glucuronidase. The urinary metabolites of LTB4 identified in this investigation were excreted in low amounts, yet it is possible that one or more of these metabolites could be used to assess LTB4 biosynthesis following activation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in vivo.

(5S,12R)-dihydroxy-6,14Z-8,10E-eico-satetraenoic acid) is a biologically active metabolite of arachidonic acid that is chemotactic for the human neutrophil and a potent lipid mediator of inflammation (1Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 1-12Google Scholar). LTB4 is not stored within a cell but synthesized following activation of certain cells through release of arachidonic acid by the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (2Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Google Scholar) and activation of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (3Funk C.F. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Google Scholar). The immediate product of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway is the reactive epoxide intermediate leukotriene A4 that is transformed by leukotriene A4 hydrolase into LTB4 (4Samuelsson B. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19469-19472Google Scholar). A specific G-protein-coupled receptor for LTB4 has now been cloned and expressed (5Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Google Scholar) and is known to be expressed by many cell types including the neutrophil (6Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 367: 620-624Google Scholar). Through this receptor, LTB4 is a potent stimulus of many functional responses of cells that are involved in immune responses (7Dasari V.R. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 48: 157-163Google Scholar) such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and various lymphocytes. LTB4 is therefore thought to be an important component of the host defense mechanisms and is currently under investigation as a potent drug for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases.The inactivation of endogenous LTB4 takes place through metabolism so that little, if any, escapes into the circulation or appears in urine as an intact molecule. The metabolic transformation of LTB4 has been studied in various cellular systems including the human neutrophil, which efficiently metabolizes LTB4 by a specific cytochrome P-450-dependent pathway (CYP4F3) to produce 20-hydroxy-LTB4 (20-OH-LTB4) (8Kikuta Y. Kato M. Yamashita Y. Miyauchi Y. Tanaka K. Kamada N. Kusunose M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 221-230Google Scholar). Additionally, other cells carry out this same step of ω-oxidation but do so with different members of this unique family of P-450 enzymes including CYP4F2 and CYP4F4 (8Kikuta Y. Kato M. Yamashita Y. Miyauchi Y. Tanaka K. Kamada N. Kusunose M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 221-230Google Scholar). The initial ω-oxidized metabolite, 20-OH-LTB4, retains significant biological activity (9Hill E. Murphy R.C. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 21: 249-253Google Scholar) but is further metabolized to biologically inactive 20-carboxy-LTB4 (20-COOH-LTB4) by both a P-450-dependent pathway (10Soberman R.J. Sutyak J.P. Okita R.T. Wendelborn D.F. Roberts L.J. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7996-8002Google Scholar, 11Sutyak J. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14818-14823Google Scholar) as well as an alcohol dehydrogenase-dependent pathway in certain cells (12Baumer T. Huber M. Mayer D. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 223-229Google Scholar). Formation of these ω-oxidation products has been observed after the incubation of LTB4 with human hepatocytes (13Wheelan P. Hankin J.A. Bilir B. Guenette D. Murphy R.C. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 326-334Google Scholar). Once ω-oxidation has occurred, 20-COOH-LTB4 can be further metabolized by β-oxidation into 18-carboxy-LTB4 (18-COOH-LTB4) and 16-COOH-LTB3 (13Wheelan P. Hankin J.A. Bilir B. Guenette D. Murphy R.C. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 326-334Google Scholar, 14Shirley M.A. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16288-16295Google Scholar) which requires formation of the CoA ester at the ω-terminal carboxyl moiety. These chain shortened products, as CoA esters, can undergo additional β-oxidation cycles from the ω-terminus to form substantially less lipophilic metabolites (14Shirley M.A. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16288-16295Google Scholar).An additional pathway of LTB4 metabolism identified in various human cells, including lung macrophages, monocytes, and keratinocytes, occurs via the 12-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase/Δ10-reductase pathway (15Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Takahashi T. Kasama T. Kobayashi Y. Sato F. Taketani Y. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18128-18135Google Scholar, 16Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25439-25448Google Scholar). This pathway leads to oxidation of the hydroxyl group at C-12 with intermediate formation of the 12-oxo product, which is then reduced at the immediately adjacent 10,11 double bond by a Δ10-reductase. This leads to a series of 10,11-dihydro metabolites, which can be precursors for ω- or β-oxidation. Metabolism by this pathway also results in a substantial reduction in biological activity (17Kumlin M. Falck J.R. Raud J. Harada Y. Dahlen S.E. Granstrom E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 23-29Google Scholar).LTB4 can also participate in synthetic metabolic reactions by conjugation with polar molecules at either hydroxy or carboxyl substituents of LTB4 and oxidized metabolites. The first LTB4 conjugation metabolite observed was a taurine conjugate of 18-COOH-LTB4 formed in the rat hepatocyte (14Shirley M.A. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16288-16295Google Scholar). Additionally, when LTB4 was incubated with human keratinocytes, a glutathione adduct was observed as an intermediate metabolite (16Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25439-25448Google Scholar). Finally, glucuronide conjugates of 20-COOH-LTB4, LTB4, and 10,11-dihydro-LTB4 have been observed as products following incubation of LTB4 with human hepatocytes (13Wheelan P. Hankin J.A. Bilir B. Guenette D. Murphy R.C. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 326-334Google Scholar).Interest in LTB4 as an endogenous inflammatory mediator has been somewhat hampered by an inability to assess in vivo production of LTB4 either in normal individuals or individuals thought to have the leukotriene pathway of arachidonate metabolism activated as a result of pathologic events. One quite successful strategy in assessing in vivo production of prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 has been the quantitative analysis of corresponding metabolites appearing in urine using sensitive and specific assays for each unique metabolite (18Fitzgerald G.A. Pedersen A.K. Patrono C. Circulation. 1983; 67: 1174-1177Google Scholar, 19Roberts L.J. Sweetman B.J. Oates J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8384-8394Google Scholar). This approach has also been used to monitor the production of leukotriene C4 in human subjects through measurement of leukotriene E4 excreted into urine (20Maclouf J. Antoine C. De Caterina R. Sicari R. Murphy R.C. Patrignani P. Loizzo S. Patrono C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H244-H249Google Scholar). LTB4 has been observed in urine only in individuals with a deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome) and Zellweger patients who lack peroxisomes and have limited β-oxidation of lipids (21Willemsen M.A.A.P. Rotteveel J.J. de Jong J.G.N. Wanders R.J.A. Ijlist L. Hoffmann G.F. Mayatepek E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 183: 61-67Google Scholar, 22Mayatepek E. Lehmann W.D. Fauler J. Tsikas D. Frolich J.C. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. Keppler D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 881-888Google Scholar).In the course of investigations into LTB4 as a potential agent useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of infections, synthetic LTB4 was administered into healthy human volunteers in studies of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. These experiments afforded the possibility to examine the urine for excreted LTB4 and LTB4 metabolites when known quantities of LTB4 were administered intravenously to human subjects. Detailed study of the urine was therefore undertaken to investigate whether or not previously identified metabolites of LTB4 described above were present in human subjects.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The free acid of LTB4 for the injection into human subjects was obtained from Cascade Biochem, Ltd. (Reading, UK), in solution at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in ethanol/water (90:10, v/v). The purity of this LTB4 (∼96%) was assessed by reversed phase HPLC with UV monitoring at 235 and 270 nm. The major contaminants were 5- and 12-epi-LTB4 (∼2%), 14-trans-LTB4 (∼1%, tentative identification), and the δ-lactone of LTB4 (∼0.5%). Very small amounts of 6-trans- and 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 were present (∼0.1% each). Leukotriene B4, 20-COOH-LTB4, and [6,7,14,15-2H4]LTB4 (d4-LTB4) used as analytical standards for quantitative analysis and mass spectrometry were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Type VII-A β-glucuronidase from Escherichia coli and bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide were purchased from Sigma. Pentafluorobenzyl bromide and N,N-diisopropylethylamine were purchased from Aldrich. All solvents were high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) grade and were obtained from Fisher.Preparation of LTB4for Injection—In order to prepare LTB4 for injection into human subjects, ethanolic LTB4 was converted into the sodium salt by the addition of 1 eq of aqueous sodium hydroxide. This ethanolic solution of neutralized LTB4 was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at 40 °C. The clear yellowish oily residue was immediately redissolved in sodium phosphate (30 mm) buffered 0.7% sodium chloride containing 0.01% EDTA to a final concentration of 0.7 mg/ml LTB4. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.5 ± 0.1, and the solution was sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-μm microporous membrane filter. The sterile solution of LTB4 was then transferred into 10-ml clear glass vials, which were sealed and stored at –80 °C. Solutions of LTB4 for injection were analyzed prior to use to assess sterility, endotoxin content, concentration, and impurity levels. The purity of LTB4 for injection was also ∼96% with a profile of impurities similar to that of the starting material with the exception that the δ-lactone of LTB4 was not present, but an impurity corresponding to the ethyl ester of LTB4 (∼0.5%) was now detectable.Injection of LTB4—Subjects enrolled in this study were members of the community at large (Quebec, Canada) who were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition, individuals were tested for the presence of alcohol as well as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C. Subjects abstained from alcohol for 2 days prior to inclusion in the study. Subjects also provided written informed consent and agreed to abide with the study restrictions, including collection of urine samples. Study subjects excluded were those with any clinically significant abnormalities as assessed from an electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory tests, or had abused alcohol or used illicit drugs. Other exclusion criteria included positive hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus or an active infection caused by herpes simplex virus, or a virus of the orthomyxovirus or rhinovirus families, and any clinically significant surgery or illness within the previous month. None of the subjects had used antiviral, antibiotic, or corticosteroids within 14 days preceding the study or had used an investigational drug within 30 days preceding this study.After overnight fasting for 10 h, subjects were injected with LTB4 as a bolus intravenous dose of 50 μg/kg (150 nmol/kg) or an identical placebo injection of sterile saline. Both the LTB4 and the placebo were administered in a total volume of ∼5 ml as a bolus injection completed within ∼1 min. A total of four subjects received LTB4 and one subject received the placebo injection.The subjects fasted for at least 1 h after drug administration, after which time they were served a controlled breakfast, and standard meals at ∼4, 9, and 13 h post-injection. Water was permitted ad libitum. Subjects remained lying down for 1 h after LTB4 injection, and vigorous physical activity was prohibited at all times during the study. Subjects were asked to empty their bladder prior to administration, and urine was then collected at two interval pools of 0–6 and 7–24 h postinjection. The urine samples were collected in polypropylene containers and kept in an ice water bath; at the end of both collection periods, the urine samples were quickly frozen and stored at –80 °C until analyzed. Throughout the study, subjects were monitored for adverse events, and a qualified medical investigator was on-site during injection of LTB4 and until 4 h after injection.Urine Extraction—The two urine sample pools from each of the five subjects (representing 0–6 and 7–24 h time periods after injection of LTB4 or placebo) were thawed and kept at 4 °C. The volume of urine in each sample was measured, then transferred into polypropylene 50-ml conical tubes, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 750 × g. The urine samples were then acidified to pH 3.7–3.8 using formic acid and subjected to solid phase extraction using 1-g cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA). The cartridges were first conditioned with 2 volumes of methanol (40 ml) and then equilibrated with 2 volumes of water. The acidified urine samples were then loaded onto the cartridges and washed with 2 volumes of water. Solvent flow through the extraction cartridges was 20 ± 5 ml/min. Lipophilic metabolites were eluted with 1 volume of methanol directly into 20-ml glass ampoules. A maximum of 500 ml of urine was loaded on each 20-ml cartridge, and when the urine sample volume exceeded 500 ml, the extraction cartridge was reconditioned, and the remaining volume of the urine sample was extracted using the same reconditioned solid phase extraction cartridge. Two extraction blanks (0.9% saline acidified with formic acid) were also prepared. The ampoules were flame-sealed and stored at –80 °C until analysis. The urine sample volumes varied from 160 to 400 ml for the 0–6-h samples and 625–1050 ml for the 7–24-h collections.Aliquots of the methanol eluate, typically 5%, were taken for subsequent extraction, purification, and treatment with β-glucuronidase. For some studies, solid phase extraction aliquots from the 0–6-h collection of each subject in the study were evaporated to dryness under vacuum and then reconstituted in 5 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 3.8 using formic acid, and the leukotrienes present in the solid phase-extracted urine were extracted using 1:1 (v/v) hexane/ethyl acetate. After vortexing 4 times for 15 s, each sample was centrifuged at 135 × g for 5 min to separate the two layers. This liquid-liquid extraction procedure was repeated 3 additional times, and the combined organic layers from each extraction were pooled and taken to dryness under vacuum.Normal-phase HPLC and RP-HPLC—The 1:1 hexane/ethyl acetate extract was further purified by normal phase chromatography using an Ultremex 5-μm silica 250 × 4.6 mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The normal phase solvents used were 90:10:0.1 hexane/isopropyl alcohol/acetic acid (solvent A) and 90:10:0.3 isopropyl alcohol, 20 mm ammonium acetate, acetic acid (solvent B). The initial mobile phase was 10% solvent B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. This initial mobile phase was held for 3 min and then a linear gradient was started to 30% solvent B at 13 min. This was followed by a second linear gradient to 40% solvent B at 25 min and finally a third linear gradient to 85% solvent B at 43 min. The column effluent was monitored using UV detection at 270 and 235 nm, and one fraction was collected each minute for 43 min.Due to the complexity of the urine matrix, it was necessary to perform reversed phase chromatography of the normal phase fractions of interest in order to increase the extent of purification. Normal phase fractions of interest were pooled, dried down under vacuum, and analyzed by reversed phase HPLC using a Synergi 10-μm Hydro-RP 250 × 4.6 mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The reversed phase solvents used were 8.3 mm acetic acid adjusted to pH 5.7 with ammonium hydroxide (solvent A) and 65:35 acetonitrile/methanol (v/v) (solvent B). The initial mobile phase was 15% solvent B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. This initial mobile phase was held for 3 min, and then a linear gradient was started to 70% solvent B at 43 min. This was followed by a second linear gradient to 100% solvent B at 55 min. The column effluent was monitored using UV detection at 270 and 235 nm, and one fraction was collected each minute for 55 min.The final analysis was carried out using reversed phase fractions of interest, which had been dried under vacuum, and then subjected to a second reversed phase HPLC separation (subsequently termed the analytical RP-HPLC) using on-line RP-HPLC with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC/MS), which employed a 150 × 1.0-mm Ultremex C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The same reversed phase solvents were used that are described above. The initial mobile phase was 15% solvent B, which was held for 3 min, and then a linear gradient was started to 60% solvent B in 30 min. This was followed by a second linear gradient to 100% solvent B at 45 min.Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry was performed on a Sciex API III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). The mass spectrometry experiments were carried out in the negative ion mode with a spray voltage of –2800 V and an orifice voltage of –65 V. Collisional activation and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) data were obtained using an offset potential of 20 eV and argon as the collision gas at a thickness of 230 × 1013 molecules/cm2.Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry—Reversed phase fractions of interest were taken to dryness under vacuum and derivatized for GC/MS analysis by the addition of 10% N,N-diisopropylethylamine in acetonitrile (50 μl) followed by the addition of 10% pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile (50 μl). These samples were kept at room temperature for 30 min and evaporated under a stream of dry nitrogen. The samples were then dissolved in 500 μl of methylene chloride and introduced onto a silica solid phase extraction column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), which was conditioned with methanol and rinsed thoroughly with hexane prior to sample addition. After sample introduction, the silica SPE column was rinsed with 6 ml of hexane, and the PFB derivatives of interest were eluted with 3 ml of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate eluate was dried down under nitrogen and further derivatized with the addition of 50 μl of acetonitrile and 50 μl of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide by incubating at 60 °C for 20 min followed by evaporation under nitrogen. The derivatized sample was dissolved in 10 μl of acetonitrile and subjected to GC/MS analysis. A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Trace 2000, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) was employed for both electron ionization (EI) and negative ion chemical ionization (NCI) analysis. NCI spectra were obtained using methane as the moderating gas, and electron ionization (EI) spectra were obtained using an electron energy of 70 eV. The [M – PFB]– ions obtained from NCI (23Murphy R.C. Snyder F. The Handbook of Lipid Research. 7. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 155-160Google Scholar) were used to determine the retention times of the ω-hydroxylated LTB4 compounds of interest. EI was used to provide detailed structural information regarding the hydroxyl group position from fragmentations that occur adjacent to the trimethylsilyl ether positions (24Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 40-51Google Scholar, 25Brodowsky I.D. Oliw E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 59-65Google Scholar).Hydrolysis of Glucuronides—An aliquot of methanol eluate (5%) from the 0–6-h pool of each subject injected with LTB4 or the placebo was dried down under vacuum and brought back up in 4.5 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. This solution was adjusted to pH 7, and 5,000 units of β-glucuronidase in 0.5 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7) was added (26Zenser T.V. Lakshmi V.M. Davis B.B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1999; 27: 1064-1067Google Scholar). This mixture was incubated in a 37 °C shaking water bath for 16 h for the quantitation experiments. For the time course experiments, the incubation times ranged from 1 to 24 h. After treatment, the liquid-liquid extraction procedure described in the initial metabolite extraction section was carried out followed by normal and reversed phase HPLC as described.Quantitation of LTB4Glucuronide and 20-COOH-LTB4—The quantity of LTB4 glucuronide and 20-COOH-LTB4 present in the urine of subjects injected with LTB4 and the placebo was determined using a stable isotope dilution LC/MS/MS protocol, essentially as described previously (27Hall L.M. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 527-532Google Scholar). The amount of LTB4 glucuronide present in urine was determined by adding 150 pmol of d4-LTB4 as internal standard to an aliquot of the solid phase extracted urine in 5 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. Hydrolysis of glucuronides was then carried out using the procedure described above followed by extraction and HPLC separation. The MRM transitions monitored were m/z 335 → 195 for LTB4 and m/z 339 → 197 for d4-LTB4. A standard curve generated used various amounts of authentic LTB4 mixed with 150 pmol of d4-LTB4, which was linear over the range 9–900 pmol LTB4. Additionally, the amount of 20-COOH-LTB4 was also calculated in the urine samples by using d4-LTB4 as the internal standard. A standard curve was constructed using known amounts of 20-COOH-LTB4 mixed with d4-LTB4 (150 pmol). The MRM transition monitored for 20-COOH-LTB4 was m/z 365 → 195.RESULTSThe administration of LTB4 to four healthy male subjects at the dose of 150 nmol/kg was well tolerated with no report of severe adverse effects. A full report of the safety and tolerability of the intravenous administration of LTB4 to healthy human subjects as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data will be published separately.The urine of subjects treated with LTB4, as well as the one placebo-treated subject, was collected into two separate pools. The first pool was 0–6 h after administration of LTB4 or placebo, and the second collection was 7–24 h after the procedure. Due to the complexity of the urine matrix, a total of five purification steps were performed in order to prepare the sample for mass spectrometric analysis. The first step in purification involved a solid phase extraction using a reversed phase protocol to remove lipophilic components from the urine matrix. The pH of the urine was adjusted to pH 3.8 prior to solid phase extraction in order to maximize recovery of LTB4 metabolites (28Powell W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 86: 467-477Google Scholar). The next purification step was a liquid-liquid extraction carried out on separate aliquots of the methanol eluate using a hexane/ethyl acetate extraction procedure that had been shown to result in excellent recovery of LTB4 as well as several of the target metabolites (data not shown). The solvent-extracted components were then subjected to normal phase HPLC using a silica column with gradient elution maximized for the separation of LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4, and 20-COOH-LTB4 (data not shown). The retention times of these leukotrienes were 7.6, 14.9, and 16.8 min, respectively, and these specific fractions (±1 min) were collected. The normal phase fractions of interest were introduced onto a 4.6-mm reversed phase HPLC column where the retention time of LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4, and 20-COOH-LTB4 standards were 36.1, 21.8, and 17.3 min, respectively. Finally, the reversed phase fractions that eluted at the expected retention times (±1 min) were introduced onto a 1-mm analytical RP-HPLC column and analyzed by on-line mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The retention times for standards and known UV absorption characteristics of leukotrienes were used as a guide to screening additional fractions than those noted for metabolites of LTB4. For example, fractions that eluted from the normal phase column after 16.8 min were analyzed for metabolites more polar than 20-COOH-LTB4. Another experimental strategy used to verify the identity of LTB4 metabolites was to monitor two MRM transitions for each known LTB4 metabolite. This strategy was critical to identify unambiguously the metabolites listed below. The MRM transitions used in this study were obtained from a previous study of the collision-induced dissociation mass spectra derived from the corresponding metabolites (13Wheelan P. Hankin J.A. Bilir B. Guenette D. Murphy R.C. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 326-334Google Scholar, 29Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc.

https://openalex.org/W2002604337,"N-Carbamoyl-d-amino acid amidohydrolase is an industrial biocatalyst to hydrolyze N-carbamoyl-d-amino acids for producing valuable d-amino acids. The crystal structure of N-carbamoyl-d-amino acid amidohydrolase in the unliganded form exhibits a α-β-β-α fold. To investigate the roles of Cys172, Asn173, Arg175, and Arg176 in catalysis, C172A, C172S, N173A, R175A, R176A, R175K, and R176K mutants were constructed and expressed, respectively. All mutants showed similar CD spectra and had hardly any detectable activity except for R173A that retained 5% of relative activity. N173A had a decreased value in k cat or K m, whereas R175K or R176K showed high K m and very low k cat values. Crystal structures of C172A and C172S in its free form and in complex form with a substrate, along with N173A and R175A, have been determined. Analysis of these structures shows that the overall structure maintains its four-layer architecture and that there is limited conformational change within the binding pocket except for R175A. In the substrate-bound structure, side chains of Glu47, Lys127, and C172S cluster together toward the carbamoyl moiety of the substrate, and those of Asn173, Arg175, and Arg176 interact with the carboxyl group. These results collectively suggest that a Cys172-Glu47-Lys127 catalytic triad is involved in the hydrolysis of the carbamoyl moiety and that Arg175 and Arg176 are crucial in binding to the carboxyl moiety, hence demonstrating substrate specificity. The common (Glu/Asp)-Lys-Cys triad observed among N-carbamoyl-d-amino acid amidohydrolase, NitFhit, and another carbamoylase suggests a conserved and robust platform during evolution, enabling it to catalyze the reactions toward a specific nitrile or amide efficiently.

Biochem. 1998; 62: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Despite low sequence identities among different species, d-NCAases require a strict d-enantiomer of the N-carbamoyl-amino acid as their substrate (5Moller A. Syldatk C. Schulze M. Wagner F. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1988; 10: 618-625Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Ogawa J. Chung M.C.-M. Hida S. Yamada H. Shimizu S. J. Biotechnol. 1994; 38: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). d-NCAase has been thus utilized as a biocatalyst in the pharmaceutical industry to produce valuable d-amino acids because of the high optical specificity. Currently, a two-enzyme reaction process is applied that starts with inexpensive substrate, d,l-5 monosubstituted hydantoins, that are synthesized from corresponding aldehydes. The first step is to hydrolyze the substrate using a d-specific hydantoinase to produce a d-carbamoyl derivative. The d-carbamoyl derivative is then converted to the corresponding d-amino acid including d-phenylglycine and d-p-hydroxyphenylglycine, the basic building blocks of β-lactam antibiotics by a second enzymatic step catalyzed by d-NCAase (2Olivieri R. Fascetti E. Angelini L. Degen L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1981; 23: 2173-2183Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Takahashi S. Ohashi T. Kii Y. Kumagai H. Yamada H. J. Ferment. Technol. 1979; 57: 328-332Google Scholar).Crystal structure of d-NCAase reveals a tetramer with 222 symmetry; each monomer shows a four-layer α-β-β-α sandwich fold (10Nakai T. Hasegawa T.

Site-directed mutagenesis of His129, His144, and His215 in d-NCAase suggests strict geometric requirements of these conserved residues to maintain a stable conformation of a putative catalytic cleft. Within this pocket, the presumptive active residue, Cys172, is just located at the bottom (12Grifantini R. Pratesi C. Galli G. Grandi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9326-9331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A Cys172-Glu47-Lys127 triad near the floor of this cavity is thus proposed to participate in catalysis, which is similar to the Cys177-Asp51-Lys144 site of N-carbamoylsarcosine amidohydrolase (CSHase) (11Wang W.C. Hsu W.H. Chien F.T. Chen C.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Nit domain of Caenorhabditis elegans NitFhit protein (13Pace H.C. Hodawadekar S.C. Draganescu A. Huang J. Bieganowski P. Pekarsky Y. Croce C.M. Brenner C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 907-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) shows a similar fold with a presumptive identical C-E-K catalytic triad. Given the structural information and a global sequence analysis, nitrilases, amidases including d-NCAase, N-acyltransferases, and presumptive amidases, are classified as a nitrilase superfamily that comprises a C-E-K catalytic triad (14Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biology. 2001; (http://genomebiology.com/2001/2/1/reviews/0001)PubMed Google Scholar). The active cysteine is postulated to attack a carbon in specific nitrile- or amide-hydrolysis or amide-condensation reactions, resulting in synthesis of various natural products. None of the crystal structures of the nitrilase superfamily, however, had substrates in the active site. The interpretation of the substrate specificity has thus largely relied on modeling (10Nakai T. Hasegawa T. Yamashita E. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Ueki T. Nanba H. Ikinaka Y. Takahashi S. Sato M. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2000; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Wang W.C. Hsu W.H. Chien F.T. Chen C.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In d-NCAase, a number of residues nearby Cys172, particularly Asn173, Arg175, and Arg176, which are located at the same loop of a solvent-accessible pocket, are indicated to participate in recognizing a substrate. Here we report that the crystal structures of the catalytically inactive d-NCAases, C172A or C172S in its free form and in complex with a substrate, N-carbamoyl-d-p-hydroxyphenylglycine (HPG), are extremely similar and that the mutation of the active Cys172 did not affect the conformation of the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of Asn173, Arg175, and Arg176, as well as crystal structures of N173A and R175A, provide further insight for substrate binding and catalytic mechanism in d-NCAase and may help in the future rational design of useful biocatalysts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Clontech with the pQE-NCA clone as the template according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, the selection primer was designed to change the XhoI site to SmaI site on the DNA target. The mutagenic primer was designed to induce a defined mutation into the DNA target of d-NCAase gene. Plasmid DNA isolated from the recipient strain, Escherichia coli BMH 71-18 mutS, was digested with XhoI and transformed into chemically treated competent JM109 E. coli cells. Mutant plasmids were subjected to DNA sequencing to confirm the successful mutations.Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes—The recombinant wild-type and mutant enzymes expressed in E. coli were isolated as described previously (15Hsu W.H. Chien F.T. Hsu C.L. Wang T.C. Yuan H.S. Wang W.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 694-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The purified protein was analyzed by a SDS-PAGE gel to verify the purity. The protein concentration was assayed according to the Bradford method (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard.Enzymatic Assays—The d-NCAase activity was assayed by monitoring the release of ammonium product, which could be colorized using Berthelot reaction to produce blue indophenol (625 nm) (17Gordon S.A. Fleck A. Bell J. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1978; 15: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The K m (mm) and k cat (min-1) values for wild-type and mutant d-NCAase were determined from initial velocity data in reactions containing enzyme, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 37 °C), 5 mm EDTA with varying concentration of HPG (1–10-fold K m).Circular Dichroism of Wild-type and Mutant d-NCAases—CD experiments were performed on an AVIV CD spectropolarimeter (model 62A DS). All scans were performed between 200 and 260 nm (0.1-cm path length) on solutions containing protein (0.5 mg ml-1), 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), and 1 mm EDTA and were determined as the average of three scans. To access the thermal stability of wild-type or mutant d-NCAases, the change of ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored as the protein sample was heated from 20 to 96 °C with a 2 °C increment. Melting temperature (T m) curve was normalized according to the highest CD signal as 1 and the lowest CD signal as 0. T m value was calculated at the temperature with the CD signal of 0.5.Crystallization— d-NCAase crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion in hanging drops by mixing the protein solution (∼15 mg ml-1) with precipitating solution at room temperature as described previously (15Hsu W.H. Chien F.T. Hsu C.L. Wang T.C. Yuan H.S. Wang W.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 694-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). C172A and C172S mutants in the presence or absence of HPG (2 mm) were initially grown as microcrystals with the precipitating condition of 1.20 m lithium sulfate and 0.1 m HEPES buffer at pH 7.0. A microseeding method was then applied to obtain large single crystals (0.5 × 0.4 × 0.1 mm). Crystals of N173A and R175A were formed directly within 1 week under 1.02 m and 1.24 mm lithium sulfate in 0.1 m HEPES buffer at pH 7.0, respectively. For R176A and R176K, no crystals were obtained. All crystals belong to space group P21 with cell dimensions (see Table I) and 4 molecules per asymmetric unit comparable with that of wild-type d-NCAase (11Wang W.C. Hsu W.H. Chien F.T. Chen C.Y. J.

C172A crystal data were collected at -150 °C using a MSC X-Stream Cryo-system with a double-mirror-focused CuKα x-ray radiation generated from a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode generator at Macromolecular x-ray Crystallographic Laboratory of National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. C172S, C172A·HPG, and C172S·HPG crystal data were collected on beamline 6A at Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan using an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector. Each data set was processed and scaled with MOSFLM (18Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and the CCP4 program suites (19CollaborativeActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar). R175A and N173A crystal data were collected on BL12B2 Taiwan beamline at Spring-8, Sayo, Japan using an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector. Data were processed with the HKL/HKL2000 suite (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). The statistics of the data collections are given in Table I.Structure Determination and Refinement—The wild-type crystal model omitting solvent molecules (Protein Data Bank code 1FO6) was used to calculate a difference Fourier map with the coefficients 2F o - F c and calculated phases for each mutant or mutant-substrate complex. A tetramer with the α/β fold was seen for each mutant or mutant-substrate complex. Clearly visible density for the substituted side chain in a mutant or that for the bound substrate was observed. A model was thus readily built for each mutant or mutant-substrate complex using the program O version 8.0 (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar).Structure refinement was carried out with the REFMAC5 program (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar). The four molecules of the asymmetric unit were refined independently first by restrained refinement procedure using the maximum-likelihood function. Five percent of the reflections were randomly selected and used to compute a free R value (R free) for cross-validation of the model. Sigma A-weighted 2F o - F c and F o - F c electron density maps were generated after each cycle of refinement step. The maps were then inspected to modify the model manually on an interactive graphics work station with the program O. The progress of the refinement was evaluated by the improvement in the quality of the maps, as well as the reduced values for R and R free. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints, as well as geometrical restraints, were then applied and gradually relaxed during the refinement. A cis-peptide between Met73 and Pro74 in each mutant and a sulfate molecule with strong density in C172A or C172S were then manually built into the model. Coupled with ARP/wARP program (23Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar), water molecules were introduced automatically into the model. TLS refinement (24Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The stereochemistry of the protein model was assessed using the program PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Estimates of the coordinate errors were made using the method of Read (26Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). A summary of data collection and the refinement statistics is shown in Table I.Structure comparisons among wild-type d-NCAase, mutant d-NCAase, and mutant-substrate complex structures were carried out with the program LSQMAN (27Kleywegt G.J.

For binding site comparison, Cα atoms or side-chain atoms of 12 residues surrounding the binding pocket (Glu47, Lys127, His144, Glu146, Cys172, Asn173, Arg175, Arg176, Asn197, Thr198, His201, and Asn202) were superimposed. A comparison of d-NCAase with the Nit domain of NitFhit (Protein Data Bank code 1EMS) or CSHase (Protein Data Bank code 1NBA) was done by superimposing side chains of three catalytic residues (Glu47, Lys127, and Cys172 in d-NCAase; Glu54, Lys127, and Cys169 in Nit; Asp51, Lys144, and Cys177 in CSHase).

The figures of electron density map were prepared with PyMOL (www.pymol.org).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONExpression and Enzymatic Analysis of d-NCAase Mutants— Based on the d-NCAase·HPG model (11Wang W.C. Hsu W.H. Chien F.T. Chen C.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), Cys172, Asn173, Arg175, and Arg176 located in a short loop near the floor of the binding pocket were chosen for mutational analysis. Cys172 was replaced with alanine or serine and expressed in E. coli, respectively. After purification by affinity chromatography, a major band of an apparent molecular mass of ∼36 kDa was observed on an SDS-PAGE gel for each mutant (Fig. 1). Approximately 10 mg of pure C172A protein and 5 mg of pure C172S protein per liter harvest were obtained, respectively. Enzymatic assay showed greatly reduced activity for both mutants; there was less than 0.1% of relative activity for C172S and no detectable activity for C172A. N173A, R175A, and R176A mutants were then constructed, expressed, and purified, respectively (Fig. 1). Both R175A and R176A showed no detectable activity, whereas there was less than 5% of relative activity for N173A as compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. We further generated R175K and R176K mutants. For either one, there was less than 0.1% of relative enzymatic activity.N173A, R175K, and R176K were subjected for kinetic analysis. As shown in Table II, R175K and R176K had ∼2.5- and 4-fold higher K m value, respectively, as compared with that of wild-type (Table II). Moreover, the k cat value was significantly reduced for either of two, resulting in an extremely lower k cat/K m value than that of wild-type. The N173A mutant had ∼13-fold reduced k cat but 2.5-fold lower K m.Table IIKinetic parameters and T m values for wild-type and mutant D-NCAasesd-NCAasekcatK mk cat/K mT mmin -1mMmin -1 mM -1°CWild-type5.2×1021.34.0×10263C172ANo activityC172SNot determined, less than 0.1% activity70N173A3.8×1010.527.3×10168R175ANo activityR176ANo activity71R175K2.7×10-13.28.5×10-265R176K6.35.41.165 Open table in a new tab CD Spectroscopy of Wild-type and Mutant d-NCAases—CD studies were performed to assess the conformational integrity and thermal stability for wild-type, C172S, N173A, R175K, R176A, and R176K. All mutants exhibited far ultraviolet CD spectra nearly identical to that of wild-type d-NCAase (data not shown), indicating a similar secondary structure. To compare the stability of the wild-type and mutant proteins, the unfolding of the protein was then monitored by the change in ellipticity at 222 nm as the temperature of the sample was increased. All transitions were found to be cooperative and irreversible and had comparable thermal stabilities with T m of 63 to 71 °C (Table II). These results suggest that each of the created mutants did not affect the secondary structure, as well as the thermal stability, of the protein.Crystal Structures of C172A, C172S, R175A, N173A, C172A·HPG, and C172S·HPG—The crystal structure of C172S was determined to 2.2 Å by molecular replacement method. Residues 3–304 were continuous and defined well in the electron density map. The final model was refined to an R of 18.8% (R free = 26.7%) (Table I). Similarly, the structure of C172A was determined and refined to 2.0 Å resolution, with an R of 17.9% (R free = 23.5%). Crystals of R175A and N173A were obtained under a similar crystallization condition as that for wild-type enzyme. Structures were then determined at 2.0 Å (R = 19.0%, R free = 24.6%) and 1.95 Å (R = 15.5%, R free = 20.9%) for R175A and N173A, respectively. Estimated coordinate error values are given in Table I. As shown in Fig. 2, the substituted side-chain electron density in residue 172 was clearly visible for either C172S (Fig. 2A) or C172A (Fig. 2B). Each of these mutant structures shows four subunits (ABCD) with 222 symmetry and is best described as a dimer of dimers like that of the wild-type structure. Moreover, the monomeric subunit of each mutant demonstrates the wild-type α-β-β-α architecture with modest deviation in the overall Cα atoms (Table III).Fig. 2The 2F o - F c electron density map of d-NCAase mutant around residue 172.

As seen in Fig. 3A, the 2F o - F c map unambiguously identified the location and orientation of the substrate in either complex structure. The model consists of four subunits (ABCD) and four substrate molecules bound to the catalytic site of each subunit (Fig. 3B). Like the free-form structure, the monomer has a α/β-type structure with two central β sheets and two helices packed on either side. The four substrates are located in a solvent-accessible cleft (Fig. 3C) near the interface of the compact dimers AB and CD, where a long C-terminal fragment extends from a helix to a site near a dyad axis and associates with another monomer. The root mean square deviation in the overall Cα atoms between the superimposed structures with or without substrate is 0.228 Å for C172A and 0.327 Å for C172S, thus indicating limited conformational change in the overall structure upon substrate binding (Table III).Fig. 3Crystal structure of the C172S-substrate complex.

A number of residues from those loops including Glu47, Lys127, His144, Glu146, Ala172/Ser172, Asn173, Arg175, Arg176, Asn197, Thr198, His201, and Asn202 interact with HPG, particularly with the carbamoyl and the carboxyl moieties (≤3.8 Å) (Fig. 4A). Superposition of the Cα atoms of the binding site region between the wild-type and mutant structures shows virtually identical conformation (C172A, 0.150 Å; C172S, 0.147 Å), indicating that substitution of cysteine with serine or alanine in residue 172 did not perturb the structure of the binding pocket (Table III). Likewise, the comparison of the free form with the substrate-bound form showed very limited change (see Table III and Fig. 4B), suggesting a sturdy site for substrate binding. In the free form of either C172A or C172S structure, a sulfate ion is bound near residue 172 (Fig. 2). Its O2 atom (Ser172 (Oγ)-sulfate"

This has been attributed to the disruption of ERBB3/ERBB2 heterodimers that maintain a crucial cell survival signal via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT. ERBB2 confers a poor clinical outcome in medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Here, we show that medulloblastoma cell sensitivity to 17-AAG is directly related to ERBB2 expression level. Furthermore, overexpression of exogenous ERBB2 in these cells induces spontaneous homodimerization, further enhancing cell sensitivity to 17-AAG. In contrast to breast cancer cells, this increased sensitivity to 17-AAG does not result from cell dependence on AKT1 activity. Rather, we show that 17-AAG generates a dose- and time-dependent increase in MEK/ERK signaling that is required for the drug to inhibit the proliferation of medulloblastoma cells and that ERBB2 sensitizes medulloblastoma cells to 17-AAG by up-regulating basal MEK/ERK signaling. We further show that down-regulation of MEK1 activity markedly reduces the sensitivity of medulloblastoma, breast, and ovarian cancer cells to 17-AAG, whereas expression of a constitutively active MEK1 potentiates the activity of 17-AAG against these cells. Therefore, intact MEK/ERK signaling may be required for optimal 17AAG activity against a variety of tumor cell types. These data identify a new mechanism by which 17-AAG inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells. Defining the precise mode of action of these agents within specific tumor cell types will be crucial if this class of drugs is to be efficiently developed in the clinic.

Med. 2002; 8: 555-561Google Scholar), the anti-tumor properties of this drug may be attributed to effects on specific signal pathways, most notably those driven by ERBB2.ERBB2 is one of the most sensitive HSP90-dependent client proteins (22Neckers L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 962-966Google Scholar). Overexpression of this receptor by breast and ovarian cancer cells renders them acutely sensitive to growth inhibition by 17-AAG (18Munster P.N.

This enhanced sensitivity has been attributed to the disruption of ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimers, which block activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT, thereby inhibiting a crucial cell survival signal (18Munster P.N. Marchion D.C. Basso A.D. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3132-3137Google Scholar, 19Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Google Scholar). Although ERBB2-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling appears to be an important target of 17-AAG, this drug also inhibits components of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (20Solit D.B.

Indeed, depletion of N-RAS, Ki-RAS, and RAF1 from colon carcinoma cells inhibits ERK1/2 activation, resulting in growth inhibition and apoptosis (16Hostein I. Robertson D. DiStefano F. Workman P. Clarke P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4003-4009Google Scholar).Little progress has been made in the development of molecular targeted therapies for pediatric malignancies. Medulloblastoma is a highly invasive pediatric brain tumor. Conventional chemo- and radiotherapy achieves a cure in only a subset of patients, and there is a great need for new therapeutic approaches (24Packer R.J.

Therefore, we investigated whether 17-AAG might be a potential new treatment for this disease. In particular, we studied the role of ERBB2 signaling in modulating the sensitivity of medulloblastoma cells to 17-AAG.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents, Antibodies, and Western Blotting—17-AAG (NSC 330507) was obtained from the National Cancer Institute's Developmental Therapeutic Program.

The Daoy medulloblastoma, MCF-7 and SKBR3 breast cancer, and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MA). ERBB2-overexpressing Daoy cell clones (designated Daoy.1 and Daoy.2) were generated by stable transfection with human ERBB2 cDNA inserted into pcDNA3.1 as described previously (26Hernan R. Fasheh R. Calabrese C. Frank A.J. Maclean K.H. Allard D. Barraclough R. Gilbertson R.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 140-148Google Scholar). Control cells transfected with empty vector alone were designated Daoy.V. We generated the AKT1 and green fluorescent protein retroviral vectors as described previously (26Hernan R. Fasheh R. Calabrese C. Frank A.J. Maclean K.H. Allard D. Barraclough R. Gilbertson R.J.

The pUSEamp/MEK1* expression vector that contains an HA-tagged constitutively activated (S218D/S222D) MEK1 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. Daoy cells were infected with retroviral vectors using standard procedures as described previously (26Hernan R. Fasheh R. Calabrese C. Frank A.J. Maclean K.H. Allard D. Barraclough R. Gilbertson R.J.

Expression of exogenous AKT1 and activated MEK1 was confirmed by HA-specific Western blotting. Green fluorescent protein expression was detected by fluorescence microscopy (34Gilbertson R.J.

MEK1 oligonucleotides were added to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 16 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) per 1 μg of DNA to give a final oligonucleotide concentration of 10 μm. Cells were incubated with oligonucleotides for 8 h before the addition of 17-AAG and processed as described.Dimer Assay—Cultured cells were treated on ice with either phosphate-buffered saline or epidermal growth factor 50 ng/ml for 2 h. 1 mm bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)-suberate (BS3) was then added, and cells were incubated for a further 45 min. Total protein lysates were then generated and analyzed by Western blotting as described.Drug Treatments—For growth inhibition studies, 3 × 103 cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well plate in 10% fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 24 h. 17-AAG or vehicle only (0.1% Me2SO) was then added, and plates were incubated for the indicated time period, up to a maximum of 96 h. For drug exposures less than 96 h, drug-containing medium was replaced with drug-free medium, and incubation was continued for a total of 96 h. After incubation, cell growth was determined using an XTT-based assay (Roche Applied Science). IC50 was defined as the drug concentration that inhibited cell proliferation by 50% for a 96-h exposure. Morphological detection of apoptosis was performed by epifluorescence microscopy of Hoechst 33258-stained cells. One observer who was blinded to all preceding cell treatments performed the apoptotic counts using nuclei from triplicate experiments.For drug combination studies, cells were pretreated for 8 h with MEK1 oligonucleotide (or scrambled control) as described above or with the MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 or U0126 (or 0.1% Me2SO control) for 2 h. 17-AAG (or 0.1% Me2SO) was then added, and growth assays were conducted as described. To determine the impact of drug treatment on protein expression, cells were treated as described for growth assays, and the total protein lysates (29Gilbertson R.J. Perry R.H. Kelly P.J. Pearson A.D. Lunec J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3272-3280Google Scholar) were analyzed by Western blotting.RESULTSERBB2 Expression Level Correlates with Medulloblastoma Cell Sensitivity to 17-AAG—Breast cancer cells that overexpress ERBB2 are dependent on ERBB3/ERBB2 heterodimer signaling. This renders them acutely sensitive to treatment with 17-AAG (18Munster P.N. Marchion D.C. Basso A.D. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3132-3137Google Scholar, 19Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Google Scholar, 23Smith V. Hobbs S. Court W. Eccles S. Workman P. Kelland L.R. Anticancer Res. 2002; 22: 1993-1999Google Scholar). We investigated whether ERBB2 similarly dictates 17-AAG activity against medulloblastoma cells. To do this, we determined the 17-AAG inhibitory concentration (IC) 50 values of 3 medulloblastoma cell lines after 96 h of continuous drug exposure and compared these to cell ERBB2 expression levels. Daoy cells that expressed low levels of ERBB2 (Fig. 1A) were relatively resistant to 17-AAG (Fig. 1B); indeed these cells displayed an IC50 value that was considerably higher than that previously reported for 40 human cancer cell lines treated under similar conditions (18Munster P.N. Marchion D.C. Basso A.D. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3132-3137Google Scholar, 20Solit D.B. Zheng F.F. Drobnjak M. Munster P.N. Higgins B. Verbel D. Heller G. Tong W. Cordon-Cardo C. Agus D.B. Scher H.I. Rosen N. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 986-993Google Scholar, 21Kelland L.R. Sharp S.Y. Rogers P.M. Myers T.G. Workman P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1940-1949Google Scholar). In contrast, MHH-MED-1 and MEB-MED-8A cells, which express moderate to high levels of ERBB2, were relatively sensitive to 17-AAG (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, ERBB2 expression level correlates with medulloblastoma cell sensitivity to 17-AAG. However, in contrast to breast cancer cells, this enhanced sensitivity cannot be mediated via ERBB3/ERBB2 heterodimers, since ERBB3 was not detected in any of the medulloblastoma cell lines (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, whereas Daoy and MHH-MED-1 cells express low level ERBB1 and high level ERBB4, respectively, ERBB2 is expressed in isolation in MEB-MED-8A cells (Fig. 1A).ERBB2 Homodimerization Activates AKT1 and ERK1/2 Signaling in Medulloblastoma Cells and Is Associated with Increased Sensitivity to 17-AAG—ERBB2 homodimers spontaneously arise when the receptor is expressed at high levels in cells (3Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O. King C.R. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1987; 237: 178-182Google Scholar, 35Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that ERBB2 homodimer signaling might increase the sensitivity of medulloblastoma cells to 17-AAG. To investigate this we induced spontaneous ERBB2 homodimerization in Daoy cells by overexpressing exogenous ERBB2 (Fig. 2A, second lane). This resulted in activation of AKT1 and ERK1/2, but not p38, JNK, STAT3, or STAT5 (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling by spontaneous ERBB2 homodimers in the absence of growth factors has been described in a number of cell types including NIH3T3 fibroblasts (36Zhou B.P. Hu M.C. Miller S.A. Yu Z. Xia W. Lin S.Y. Hung M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8027-8031Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which ERBB2 homodimers activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT remains to be determined. Our data indicate that overexpression of ERBB2 did not increase cell signaling via ERBB1/ERBB2 heterodimerization, since ERBB1 was not phosphorylated (Fig. 2B) and ERBB1/ERBB2 heterodimers could only be detected after treatment with exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Fig. 2A, third lane).Fig. 2Overexpression of exogenous ERBB2 in the 17-AAG-resistant Daoy cell line induces spontaneous ERBB2 homodimerization, activation of AKT1, and ERK1/2 signaling and increased sensitivity to 17-AAG.A, Daoy cells transfected with empty vector (Daoy.V) or pcDNA3.1/ERBB2 (Daoy.2) were treated on ice with either phosphate-buffered saline (–) or 50 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF)(+) for 2 h. 1 mm bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)-suberate (BS3) was then added, and cells were incubated for a further 45 min. Total protein lysates were generated and analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody specific for phospho-Tyr-1248 of ERBB2. Note that spontaneous ERBB2 homodimers (D1) were only detected in ERBB2-overexpressing Daoy.2 cells (compare first and second lanes). Epidermal growth factor induced the formation of a distinct ERBB1/ERBB2 heterodimer complex (D2). M, monomers. B, total protein lysates were prepared from exponentially growing cultures of Daoy.V and two independent ERBB2-transfected Daoy clones (Daoy.1 and Daoy.2). Fifty micrograms of each lysate were analyzed by phospho (p)-specific Western blotting for activation of ERBB1, ERBB2, ERK1/2, and AKT1 signaling. Levels of phosphorylated proteins were compared with total amounts of the respective protein. Expression levels of RAF1, TP53, and the key chaperone components HSP90, HSP70, and GRP94 were also determined. C, Daoy.V, Daoy.1, and Daoy.2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and exposed to the indicated concentrations of 17-AAG (or vehicle alone) for 96 h. The percentage growth inhibition of 17-AAG relative to vehicle-treated cells was then determined using an XTT-based assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next investigated the impact of ERBB2 homodimer signaling on cell sensitivity to 17-AAG. After 96 h of continuous exposure to 17-AAG, two independent ERBB2-transfected Daoy clones were significantly more sensitive to growth inhibition by 17-AAG than control cells (Fig. 2C). These data confirm that ERBB2 sensitizes medulloblastoma cells to 17-AAG and support the hypothesis that this is mediated by ERBB2 homodimer signaling via AKT1 and/or ERK1/2. Importantly, the expression of key chaperone proteins was not affected by ERBB2 transfection and, thus, did not account for differences in 17-AAG sensitivity (Fig. 2B).ERBB2 Homodimers Sensitize Medulloblastoma Cells to 17-AAG by Up-regulating ERK1/2 Signaling—We reasoned that ERBB2 homodimer signaling could increase medulloblastoma cell sensitivity to 17-AAG through two alternative mechanisms. Up-regulation of AKT1 or ERK1/2 activity might provide a crucial survival signal for medulloblastoma cells. Thus, analogous to the disruption of ERBB3/ERBB2 heterodimers by 17-AAG in breast cancer cells (18Munster P.N. Marchion D.C. Basso A.D. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3132-3137Google Scholar, 19Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Google Scholar), down-regulation of ERBB2 homodimers could inhibit a pro-survival signal. Conversely, AKT1 or ERK1/2 could play an active role in 17-AAG-mediated growth inhibition. In this situation, up-regulation of one or both of these pathways by ERBB2 homodimers could sensitize medulloblastoma cells to the drug.To investigate these alternative hypotheses we exposed Daoy cells to a range of 17-AAG concentrations and studied the impact of this treatment on cell protein expression levels. Continuous exposure of control cells to 17-AAG (48 h) abolished ERBB2 expression and generated a dose-dependent depletion of phosphorylated AKT1 (Fig. 3A). 17-AAG also caused a decrease in total AKT1 protein expression in these cells, albeit to a lesser extent than the phosphorylated form. In contrast, 17-AAG was relatively ineffective at inhibiting AKT1 in ERBB2-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Indeed, phosphorylation of AKT1 was unaffected by 250 nm 17-AAG, which inhibited the growth of these cells by ≥75% (Fig. 2C). This signaling was maintained by active ERBB2 homodimers that could still be detected in the presence of 250 nm 17-AAG (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that inhibition of ERBB2/AKT1 signaling is unlikely to account for the increased sensitivity of ERBB2-overexpressing Daoy cells to 17-AAG.Fig. 3Characterization of 17-AAG activity against the activation and expression status of signal pathway and chaperone proteins in Daoy, MHH-MED-1, and MEB-MED-8A medulloblastoma cells.A, exponentially growing cultures of Daoy.V, Daoy.1, and Daoy.2 cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of 17-AAG (or vehicle alone, Control) for 48 h. Total cell lysates were then prepared, and expression of the indicated proteins was determined by Western blot analysis. B, the MHH-MED-1 and MEB-MED-8A medulloblastoma cell lines were subject to the same treatment described in A, and expression of ERBB2, RAF-1, and pERK1/2 was determined by Western blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Unexpectedly, 17-AAG generated a dose-dependent increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in Daoy cells (Fig. 3A). This was not affected by ERBB2 expression status and occurred despite concurrent degradation of RAF1. As previously reported (37Piatelli M.J. Doughty C. Chiles T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12144-12150Google Scholar, 38Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Romanova L. Mushinski J.F. Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 1997; 239: 655-659Google Scholar), 17-AAG did not affect expression of either total MEK1 or ERK1. To investigate whether up-regulation of ERK1/2 activity by 17-AAG is a general feature of medulloblastoma cells, we analyzed the impact of 17-AAG treatment on ERBB2, RAF-1, and pERK1/2 expression levels in MHH-MED-1 and MEB-MED-8A cells. 17-AAG generated a dose-dependent increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation independent of ERBB2 and RAF1 in these cells (Fig. 3B). In other cell line systems, ansamycins have been reported to decrease MEK/ERK signaling by depleting upstream components and activators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (37Piatelli M.J. Doughty C. Chiles T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12144-12150Google Scholar, 38Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Romanova L. Mushinski J.F. Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Mol.

Conversely, our data indicate that 17-AAG can positively regulate MEK/ERK signaling independent of RAF-1 in medulloblastoma cells, presumably by inducing alternative activators of this signal cassette. Furthermore, these data support the hypothesis that induction of ERK1/2 plays a positive role in the anti-proliferative activity of 17-AAG. Therefore, although the induction of ERK1/2 by 17-AAG appears independent of ERBB2 and RAF1 (Fig. 3, A and B), up-regulation of basal ERK1/2 signaling by ERBB2 homodimers (Fig. 2B) may nonetheless sensitize medulloblastoma cells to 17-AAG. Indeed, the high ERBB2-expressing, 17-AAG-sensitive Daoy.1, Daoy.2, MHH-MED-1, and MEB-MED-8A cells all demonstrate detectable basal pERK1/2, which is absent in low ERBB2-expressing, 17-AAG-resistant Daoy.V cells (Fig. 3, A and B).To investigate further the role of ERK1/2 signaling in 17-AAG activity, we used the isogenic empty vector and ERBB2-transfected Daoy cells to study the temporal relationship between drug-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and growth inhibition. As expected, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was undetectable in untreated Daoy.V control cells (Fig. 4A). However, exposure of these cells to 250 nm 17-AAG for 16 h activated ERK1/2 (Fig. 4A). This coincided exactly with the duration of drug exposure required to inhibit the growth of these cells (Fig. 4B). In contrast, ERK1/2 activation was readily detected in vehicle and 17-AAG-treated ERBB2-transfected cells (Fig. 4A), and only 8 h of drug exposure were required to significantly inhibit cell growth (Fig. 4B). Similar results were observed in the other ERBB2-transfected clone (Daoy.1). In contrast, AKT1 activity in both control and ERBB2-transfected cells was largely unaffected by drug exposures of less than 24 h (Fig. 4A).Fig. 417-AAG-induced ERK1/2 activity and growth inhibition are correlated in Daoy cells.A, Daoy.V and Daoy.2 cells were exposed to 250 nm 17-AAG for the indicated times. Total protein lysates were then prepared and analyzed by Western blotting for expression of the indicated phosphorylated (p) proteins. Actin was employed as a loading and transfer control. B, cells were seeded into 96-well plates and exposed to 250 nm 17-AAG or vehicle-only for the indicated times.

Whereas apoE is not a ligand for receptor binding in buffer alone, interaction with lipid confers receptor recognition properties. To investigate the nature of proposed lipid binding-induced conformational changes in apoE, we employed multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy to determine the structure of an LDL receptor-active, 58-residue peptide comprising residues 126–183 of apoE in association with the micelle-forming lipid dodecylphosphocholine (DPC). In the presence of 34 mm DPC the peptide forms a continuous amphipathic helix from Glu131 to Arg178. NMR relaxation studies of DPC-bound apoE-(126–183), in contrast to apoE-(126–183) in the presence of TFE, are consistent with an isotropically tumbling peptide in solution giving a global correlation time of ∼12.5 ns. These data indicate that the helical peptide is curved and constrained by a lipid micelle consisting of ∼48 DPC molecules. Although the peptide behaves as if it were tumbling isotropically, spectral density analysis reveals that residues 150–183 have more motional freedom than residues 134–149. These molecular and dynamic features are discussed further to provide insight into the structural basis for the interaction between apoE and the ligand binding repeats of the LDL receptor.

When complexed to lipoproteins, apoE mediates whole particle uptake and removal from the circulation via members of the LDL receptor family. Biophysical studies reveal that apoE is comprised of two structural domains, a 22-kDa N-terminal (NT) domain and a 10-kDa C-terminal domain (4Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal domains are connected by a flexible, unstructured, region encompassing amino acids 191–216 that is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. Studies conducted with isolated domains reveal that the NT domain contains amino acids responsible for binding to the LDL receptor (6Innerarity T.L. Friedlander B.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have led to a consensus that localizes the receptor-binding site to residues 136–150 (7Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region of the protein is rich in basic amino acids, and their proposed role in receptor interactions is consistent with studies demonstrating loss of receptor binding following chemical modification of lysine and arginine residues (8Mahley R.W.

On the other hand, complexation with phospholipids results in a particle that binds efficiently to the LDL receptor (6Innerarity T.L. Friedlander B.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J.

These data indicate that a lipid binding-induced conformational adaptation of apoE, which can be mimicked by the isolated NT domain, is an essential feature of apoE function as a ligand for receptor-mediated endocytosis of plasma lipoproteins.

Each α-helix segment is amphipathic, orienting its hydrophobic face toward the center of the bundle. The structure of lipid-free apoE3-NT provides a useful starting point for development of models of how the helix bundle alters its structure upon interaction with lipid surfaces to adopt a receptor-active conformation. Weisgraber et al. (12Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Miller N.E. Tall A.R. High Density Lipoproteins and Atherosclerosis III. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 175-181Google Scholar) studied the surface properties of apoE3-NT at the air/water interface on a monolayer balance. These investigators concluded that the protein spreads on the surface to occupy a volume greater than can be accounted for by the globular helix bundle conformation. More recently, NMR spectroscopy studies have provided evidence for a major conformational change in the NT domain upon interaction with lipid (13Lund-Katz S. Zaiou M. Wehrli S. Dhanasekaran P.

These investigators presented a model wherein apoE-NT adopts an open conformation, circumscribing the perimeter of the disc bilayer with its helical axes aligned perpendicular to the fatty acyl chains of DMPC, to adopt a receptor active conformation (6Innerarity T.L.

A 58-residue peptide encompassing the receptor binding region of apoE was generated by CNBr cleavage of recombinant apoE3-(1–183), purified and characterized. Far UV CD spectroscopy of the peptide showed that it is unstructured in aqueous solution. Importantly, however, apoE3-(126–183) efficiently transforms anionic phospholipid vesicles into LDL receptor competent, peptide-lipid complexes. Analysis of these complexes by electron microscopy revealed disc-shaped particles with an average diameter of 13 ± 3 nm. Subsequently, the structure of this receptor-active apoE peptide was determined by NMR experiments conducted in the presence of the lipid mimetic cosolvent trifluoroethanol (TFE) (20Raussens V. Slupsky C.M. Ryan R.O. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29172-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In 50% TFE, apoE-(126–183) forms a continuous amphipathic α-helix over residues Thr130–Glu179. To extend these findings and investigate the structural organization of apoE-(126–183) in the presence of lipid, we have determined the structure of apoE-(126–183) in complex with the micelleforming single acyl chain phospholipid dodecylphosphocholine (DPC). Electrostatic and geometric features of the apoE-(126–183) DPC-bound structure suggest that apoE binds to the LDL receptor by interacting with more than one of its ligand binding repeats. The results are discussed in terms of structural determinants responsible for apoE conformational adaptability and binding to the LDL receptor family. Preparation of ApoE-(126–183)—Uniformly 15N-labeled apoE3-(126–183) was prepared as previously described (19Raussens V Mah M.K.H. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol.

NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed on ∼2 mm15N-labeled apoE-(126–183) in the presence of 34 mm DPC-d38,in500 μl of 10% H2O/90% D2O, pH 6.0, containing 0.01% (w/v) NaN3 and 2 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate as an internal chemical shift reference. NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on Varian INOVA 500 MHz and Unity 600 MHz NMR spectrometers. Data were processed using NMRPIPE (21Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRVIEW (22Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2670) Google Scholar). Complete 1H and 15N spectral assignments of apoE-(126–183) were obtained using gradient-enhanced three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY and NOESY (τmix, 75 ms) experiments to identify spin systems and inter-residue connectivities as described by Wüthrich (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Confirmation of side-chain assignment was obtained through the use of three-dimensional HNHB and two-dimensional natural abundance 13CHSQC spectra. 15N T 1, T 2, and heteronuclear NOE relaxation data were recorded at 25 °C on both 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers using the enhanced sensitivity gradient pulse sequences developed by Farrow et al. (24Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). The T 1 relaxation decay was sampled at 11 time points on each spectrometer: 11.1, 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999, and 1110 ms. The T 2 relaxation decay was sampled at different 11 time points: 16.6, 33.2, 49.8, 66.4, 83.0, 99.7, 116.3, 132.9, 149.5, 166.1, and 182.7 ms on the 500 MHz spectrometer and 16.5, 33.1, 49.6, 66.2, 82.7, 99.3, 115.8, 132.4, 148.9, 165.4, and 182.0 ms on the 600 MHz spectrometer. The exponential decay curves for T 1 and T 2 peak intensities were fit using the in-house program Xcrvfit (inhouse written program; www.pence.ualberta.ca/software). 1H-15N NOE values were obtained from the ratio of the peak intensity from proton-saturated and unsaturated spectra. Reduced spectral density mapping was carried out as described in Farrow et al. (25Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Szabo A. Torchia D.A. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—An ensemble of 147 apoE-(126–183) structures was computed from the distance and dihedral angle restraints available (Table I) starting with an extended chain using a simulated annealing protocol (26Nilges M.

Yale University Press, New Haven, CT.1992Google Scholar). Inter-proton distance restraints were derived from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY experiments recorded with a τmix of 75 and 120 ms. Distances were calibrated according to Slupsky and Sykes (29Slupsky C.M. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15953-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). φ backbone dihedral angles were calculated based on measured 3JHN-Hα coupling constants in an HNHA experiment (30Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 79-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and the Karplus equation (31Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2870-2871Crossref Scopus (2276) Google Scholar). ψ dihedral angle restraints were obtained from the ratio of the dNα(i,i)/dαN(i–1,i) in the three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY spectrum (32Gagné S. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The statistical values for the 50 lowest energy structures are presented in Table I. Families of structures were extracted from the ensemble of structures using the program NMRCLUST (33Kelly A.L. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). For clustering, the backbone heavy atoms of residues 134–149 of the 50 structures were superimposed, and clustering was based on residues 133–177.Table IStructural statistics for DPC bound apoE-(126–183)NOE restraintsaAll structures satisfy experimental restraints with no distance violations greater than 0.2 Å and no dihedral violations greater than 2°.EnergybEnergies for the 50 lowest energy structures, in kcal mol-1.Dihedral restraintsaAll structures satisfy experimental restraints with no distance violations greater than 0.2 Å and no dihedral violations greater than 2°.RMSD from idealized valueTotal, 435E total, 69.6 ± 1.4Total, 71Bonds, 0.00397 ± 0.00008 ÅIntraresidue, 164E bonds, 15.2 ± 0.6Phi, 40Angles, 0.422 ± 0.006°Sequential, 185E angles, 47.1 ± 1.2Psi, 31Improper angles, 0.247 ± 0.009°Medium range,c(2 > = |i - j| = <4). 86E VDW, 0.14 ± 0.24E NOE, 2.4 ± 0.5E dihedral, 0.3 ± 0.1a All structures satisfy experimental restraints with no distance violations greater than 0.2 Å and no dihedral violations greater than 2°.b Energies for the 50 lowest energy structures, in kcal mol-1.c (2 > = |i - j| = <4). Open table in a new tab Preparation and Characterization of ApoE-(126–183)—As previously shown, apoE-(126–183) is insoluble in aqueous solution above pH 4, and below pH 4, the peptide is not structured in water. However, in the presence of either lipids, such as dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG), DPC, or lipid-mimicking agents, such as TFE, it adopts a high (70–80%) helical content (19Raussens V Mah M.K.H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29172-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previously, it was determined that 13 mm DPC is sufficient to induce full structuring of this peptide (19Raussens V Mah M.K.H. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For NMR experiments, we prepared the sample by resuspending lyophilized 15N-labeled apoE-(126–183) in D2O/ H2O (9:1, v/v). Owing to residual HCl following lyophilization (19Raussens V Mah M.K.H. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the pH of the solution was around 3.5. To this solution, in a stepwise manner, deuterated DPC was added from a concentrated stock solution in D2O. Upon each addition, one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra were recorded. Addition of DPC was stopped when the spectra did not show a change between two consecutive additions (data not shown). The final DPC concentration was 34 mm. Following DPC titration, the pH of the sample was adjusted to 6.0 by stepwise addition of 500 mm NaOD in D2O. Structure of ApoE-(126–183)— Fig. 1 displays a two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectrum of DPC-bound apoE-(126–183) obtained at 600 MHz. Despite the presence of broader peaks than those observed in 50% TFE (20Raussens V. Slupsky C.M. Ryan R.O. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29172-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), most resonances were well resolved. Three pairs of resonances overlap (Glu132 with Arg172, Leu148 with Leu159, and Asp153 with Arg167) and other resonances partially overlap (Ala138 with Leu155 and Arg178, and Arg142, Asp151, and Gln163). In addition, three residues, including the two N-terminal residues, Leu126, Gly127 and the residue preceding the C-terminal proline, Gly182, are missing. The secondary structure of apoE-(126–183) was determined using NMR spectroscopy based upon NOE connectivities, the Hα NMR chemical shift index (CSI) (34Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar, 35Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar) and the ratio of dNα/dαN NOEs (32Gagné S. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A summary of these data is illustrated in Fig. 2. Helical secondary structure was defined as previously described (20Raussens V. Slupsky C.M. Ryan R.O. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29172-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that DPC-bound apoE-(126–183) is composed of a single α-helix spanning the sequence from Glu131 to Glu179, with the first five and last four residues unstructured. Fig. 2 also shows evidence of the simultaneous presence of unambiguous dαN(i,i+2) and dαN(i,i+4) NOEs for residues Leu133–Val135, Ala152–Asp154, and Gln156–Arg158. According to Wüthrich (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), dαN(i,i+4) is characteristic of an α-helix whereas dαN(i,i+2) is characteristic of a 310-helix. The simultaneous presence of both NOEs for the same residue may reflect a degree of internal flexibility for these residues. An amide proton secondary shift plot (Fig. 3) shows a periodicity of 3–4 residues from Thr130 to Arg178, typical of a curved amphipathic α-helix (36Kuntz I.D. Kosen P.A. Craig E.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 1406-1408Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 37Zhou N.E. Zhu B.-Y. Sykes B.D. Hodges R.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 4320-4326Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In general, hydrophobic residues tend to have a downfield deviation for this type of structure. ApoE-(126–183) deviates somewhat from the ideal situation. For example Arg134, Arg145, and Gln156 show unexpected downfield deviations characteristic of hydrophobic residues, while Val135, Ala160, and Val161 show upfield deviations. In a helical wheel representation of this region of the peptide (data not shown) Arg134, Arg145, and Gln156 are located on the hydrophobic face of the helix, close to the interface between the polar and nonpolar sides of the amphipathic helix. Since Arg and Gln have relatively long side-chain structures, the Cβ and Cγ (as well as Cδ for Arg) acyl groups may be considered as apolar motifs, maintaining hydrophobic interactions with other nonpolar residues in this region while the polar terminus of the side-chain is capable of protruding beyond the hydrophobic face of the helix. Ala160 is located near the polar-nonpolar interface, close to the polar side. This could explain the small upfield deviation observed for this residue. Val161 is located on the polar face of the helix and on the predicted convex side of the curvature, explaining the unexpected upfield deviation observed for this hydrophobic amino acid, as the amide proton secondary deviation is related to the hydrogen bond length. Two regions of the peptide, around Ala152–Asp153 and Gln163–Gly169, show a 3–4 residue periodicity but with a lesser intensity and a non-significant amide shift deviation. These regions might indicate differences in helix curvature around these amino acids since secondary structural data indicate these residues are helical. Indeed, previously it was shown with model peptides that a lack of amide proton secondary shift 3–4-residue periodicity is not due to the absence of a helical conformation but, rather, comes from a less curved structure (37Zhou N.E. Zhu B.-Y. Sykes B.D. Hodges R.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 4320-4326Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of apoE-(126–183) was calculated from NOE and dihedral restraints as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An ensemble of 147 structures was computed, none of which contained distance restraint violations greater than 0.2 Å or dihedral angle violations greater than 2°. The 50 structures with the lowest calculated total energy were selected for further consideration. According to PROCHECK-NMR (38Laskowski R.A. Rullman J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar), 99.7% of the non-glycine residues have (φ, ψ) angles in the most favored or the additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot for these 50 structures (data not shown). The average structure, resulting from superposition of the 50 lowest energy structures, is a long curved helix spanning residues Glu131 to Arg178, according to a DSSP analysis (39Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12186) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic amino acids are, for the most part, oriented toward the interior of the curvature as expected from the amide secondary chemical shift behavior for an amphipathic helix, and as expected for a helix bound to the surface of a lipid micelle. Superposition of the final 50 structures along the length of the helix revealed a rather poor convergence. Since the peptide is bound to DPC micelles, at first glance this did not appear to make sense. A relaxation analysis (discussed below) revealed that residues 134–149 are quite rigid whereas residues 150–178 appear to show slightly increased internal motions in addition to increased slow motions. Superposition of 15 of the most similar 50 structures over residues 134–149 reveals a backbone RMSD of 0.55 ± 0.11 Å and a heavy atom RMSD of 1.4 ± 0.11 Å (Fig. 4a). As may be observed, while the entire helix remains intact, the relative position of residues 150–178 with respect to residues 134–149 changes. Because of this, we tried to extract conformationally related structure subfamilies using the program NMRCLUST (33Kelly A.L. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). For clustering, the backbone heavy atoms of residues 134–149 of the 50 structures were superimposed, and clustering was based on residues 133–177. Nine subfamilies were obtained with four structures considered as outliers. Among the subfamilies, the first three contain more than 50% of the structures. Fig. 4b shows the representative structures of the three most populated subfamilies in complex with a modeled DPC micelle composed of 54 DPC molecules (40Tieleman D.P. van der Spoel D. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 6380-6388Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). While the DPC micelle is only a model and is slightly bigger than what we would expect based on the overall correlation time, the complex gives a conceptual idea of how this peptide may adopt different conformations when bound to DPC. It suggests that the C-terminal portion of the peptide (residues 150–183) has a lower affinity for the micelle than residues 134–149. As will be discussed later, this has important implications for the interaction of apoE-(126–183) with the receptor. The structures in each subfamily are well defined over the entire helical length, with RMSDs about the mean coordinate positions of 2.45 Å for subfamily 1, 2.04 Å for subfamily 2, and 1.94 Å for subfamily 3 for backbone atoms of residues 137–173. However, for the most stable helical region of the peptide (residues 134–149, see below), the RMSDs about the mean coordinate positions for backbone atoms are as follows: 0.73 Å for subfamily 1, 0.71 Å for subfamily 2, and 0.66 Å for subfamily 3. This shows that the structure is well defined locally. As observed previously in TFE, the structure subfamilies display differing degrees of helix curvature. Relaxation Measurements of ApoE-(126–183)—To gain insight into the motions of DPC-bound apoE-(126–183), longitudinal (T 1) and transverse (T 2) 15N NMR relaxation times as well as 1H-15N heteronuclear NOEs were measured. The R 1 (1/T 1) and R 2 (1/T 2) relaxation rates as well as the heteronuclear NOEs at field strengths of 500 and 600 MHz are shown in Fig. 5. Of the 58 residues in apoE-(126–183), the three missing and twelve overlapping resonances were not used in the backbone dynamics analysis. In general terms, apoE-(126–183) bound to an isotropic DPC micelle of ∼50 molecules/ micelle (aggregation number for DPC is 50–60, Ref. 41Henry G.D. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 515-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) should result in an overall rotational correlation time of ∼13 ns, characteristic of an isotropically tumbling molecule of ∼26 kDa. Consistent with this concept, the average rotational correlation time for DPC bound apoE-(126–183) was determined to be ∼12.5 ns. Fig. 5 reveals the measured relaxation characteristics of apoE-(126–183) bound to DPC micelles. T"

CYP4F3A inactivates leukotriene B4, a reaction that has significance for controlling inflammation. CYP4F3B converts arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a potent activator of protein kinase C. We have previously shown that mRNAs coding for CYP4F3A and CYP4F3B are generated from distinct transcription start sites in neutrophils and liver. We therefore investigated mechanisms that regulate the cell-specific expression of these two isoforms. Initially, we analyzed the distribution of CYP4F3 in human leukocytes and determined a lineage-specific pattern of isoform expression. CYP4F3A is expressed in myeloid cells and is coordinate with myeloid differentiation markers such as CD11b and myeloperoxidase during development in the bone marrow. In contrast, CYP4F3B expression is restricted to a small population of CD3+ T lymphocytes. We identified distinct transcriptional features in myeloid, lymphoid, and hepatic cells that indicate the presence of multiple promoters in the CYP4F3 gene. The hepatic promoter depends on a cluster of hepatocyte nuclear factor sites 123–155 bp upstream of the initiator ATG codon. The myeloid promoter spans 400 bp in a region 468–872 bp upstream of the ATG codon; it is associated with clusters of CACCT sites and can be activated by ZEB-2, a factor primarily characterized as a transcriptional repressor in cells that include lymphocytes. ZEB-2 interacts with C-terminal binding protein and Smads, and this would provide opportunities for integrating environmental signals in myelopoiesis and inflammation.

The ability of cells to attain differentiated stages in development and to alter their functional phenotype in inflammatory settings depends on lineage-specific and cytokine-dependent transcription factors that either activate or repress target genes. Distinct patterns of transcription factors are associated with the myeloid and lymphoid lineages in hematopoiesis (1Zhu J. Emerson S.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3295-3313Google Scholar) and with the induction of pro-inflammatory genes in host defense (2Hawiger J. Immunol. Res. 2001; 23: 99-109Google Scholar). Transcription factor activity is context-dependent; a repressor of one gene can activate a different gene associated with an opposing function or alternative cell lineage (3Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 513-519Google Scholar). This has implications for the coordinated induction and repression of sets of genes that are functionally related. ZEB-1 (δEF1, Zfhx1a) and ZEB-2 (SIP1, Zfhx1b) are recently characterized two-handed zinc finger transcription factors (4Remacle J.E. Kraft H. Lerchner W. Wuytens G. Collart C. Verschueren K.

LTB4 is synthesized from arachidonic acid by the sequential action of 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene A4 hydrolase, and the chemoattractant activity of LTB4 is mediated by a high affinity G protein-coupled receptor designated BLT1 (22Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar). The major pathway for the catabolism and inactivation of LTB4 in human neutrophils involves microsomal ω-hydroxylation by CYP4F3 (11Shak S. Goldstein I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10181-10187Google Scholar). This reaction generates 20-OH LTB4, which can further inhibit LTB4 activities by down-regulating BLT1 (23Pettipher E.R. Salter E.D. Breslow R. Raycroft L. Showell H.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 423-427Google Scholar). The ability of LTB4 to amplify an inflammatory response is, therefore, counterbalanced by the expression of CYP4F3. Recently we cloned the CYP4F3 gene and demonstrated that alternative splicing generates isoforms that differ in functional properties and tissue distribution (24Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Google Scholar, 25Christmas P. Jones J.P. Patten C.J. Rock D. Zheng Y. Cheng S.M. Weber B.M. Carlesso N. Scadden D.T. Rettie A.E. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38166-38172Google Scholar). Selection of exon 4 generates the neutrophil isoform (CYP4F3A), which has a low Km for LTB4 of <1 μm. Selection of exon 3 instead of exon 4 generates an alternative isoform (CYP4F3B), which has a 44-fold lower efficiency of inactivating LTB4. CYP4F3B is expressed in liver and has a preference for arachidonic acid as a substrate, which it converts to 20-HETE (25Christmas P. Jones J.P. Patten C.J. Rock D. Zheng Y. Cheng S.M. Weber B.M. Carlesso N. Scadden D.T. Rettie A.E. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38166-38172Google Scholar). This has significance because 20-HETE is a potent bioactive mediator in certain tissues; it activates protein kinase C and has roles in regulating cell proliferation, vascular tone, and natriuresis (26McGiff J.C. Quilley J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R607-R623Google Scholar). These opposing capacities of the CYP4F3 isoforms to generate an active mediator (20-HETE) or inactivate one (LTB4) allow for versatility of function but demand strict controls. CYP4F3 transcription and alternative splicing must be regulated to ensure that the appropriate isoform is generated in the correct setting. To understand the regulation of CYP4F3 expression, we examined its distribution in maturing populations of human bone marrow cells and identified the splicing pathways. CYP4F3A is expressed in myeloid cells; its expression is coordinate with known myeloid differentiation markers such as CD11b and also increases concomitantly with myeloperoxidase during development. In contrast, CYP4F3B is expressed in lymphocytes, and expression is restricted to a small population (∼10%) of CD3+ T cells. We determined that alternative promoters regulate lineage-specific expression of CYP4F3 isoforms in myeloid cells, lymphoid cells, and liver. Surprisingly, activity of the myeloid-specific promoter could not be accounted for by known myeloid transcription factors including PU.1 and MZF-1, but it could be activated by ZEB-2 and CtBP. The results suggest new roles for these proteins in myeloid transcription. ZEBs and CtBP are regulated by activated Smads and NAD+, respectively, and therefore have the capacity to integrate various environmental signals during development or inflammation. Cells—Human bone marrow was obtained from discarded filters used in the processing of normal donor marrow from transplantation at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy donors according to established guidelines. Approval for the use of human samples was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Massachusetts General Hospital/Partners. Granulocytes and lymphocytes were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation. HL60 cells (human promyelocytic cell line) were maintained in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were treated with 1.3% Me2SO for 4 days to induce granulocytic differentiation before transfection experiments. HepG2 cells (human hepatoma-derived cell line) and COS 7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Flow Cytometry—Total bone marrow mononuclear cells and peripheral blood granulocytes and lymphocytes were stained with allophycocyanin, percyphycoerythrin, or fluoroisothiocyanate-conjugated control IgGs or monoclonal antibodies directed to CD34, CD38, CD33, CD13, CD16, CD15, CD11b, CD14, CD8, and CD3 (BD Biosciences) to define hematopoietic cell subsets in a double or tri-color labeling. Surface-labeled samples were then fixed in 0.1% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 to perform intracytoplasmic staining with anti-CYP4F3 antibody. Production, purification, and characterization of polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the C-terminal domain (amino acids 410–520) of CYP4F3, which recognize both isoforms (CYP4F3A and CYP4F3B), has been described previously (24Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Google Scholar). Intracellular staining was performed on unlabeled or surface-labeled cells after fixation and permeabilization. Samples were incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-CYP4F3 polyclonal antibody or 3 μg/ml control rabbit IgG for 30 min at room temperature and were then incubated with 1 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit phycoerythrin-conjugated or fluoroisothiocyanate-conjugated polyclonal antibodies (Sigma). Tri- or four-color-labeled samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry using the FACScalibur instrument and the Cellquest program (BD Biosciences). The data were plotted as single-parameter histograms or bivariate dot plots with logarithmic amplification. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and Isoform-specific PCR— Total RNA was isolated from cells using Tri Reagent (Sigma). Reverse transcription and first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the cDNA cycle kit (Invitrogen) with random primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The cDNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. CYP4F3A and CYP4F3B were detected by isoform-specific PCR as described previously (24Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Google Scholar). Primer pairs specific for ZEB-1 (forward, 5′-CTGAAGAGGACCAGAGGCAG-3′, reverse, 5′-CCCAGACTGCGTCACATGTC-3′), ZEB-2 (forward, 5′-CTGAGGAGCTGTCTCGCCTT-3′, reverse, 5′-GCTCCTTGGGTTAGCATTTGGTGC-3′), or primers that would bind to CtBP-1 and CtBP-2 (forward, 5′-CCAGGGAGGACCTGGAGAAGTTCA-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCACCTCGCGGATCTGCTC-3′) were used in PCR reactions with conditions of 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′-RACE) Analysis—The 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) sequences of CYP4F3 transcripts in different RNA samples were determined by 5′-RACE (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with primer 1 (5′-CCCCAACCAGCAGCAGGAGCAGCC-3′, +79 to +56 relative to adenosine of first methionine). First-round PCR was with the Anchor Primer and primer 2 (5′-ATGCTGCCATTGGCCAAA-3′, +48 to +31). Second-round PCR was with the Universal Amplification Primer and primer 3 (5′-GACAGGCTCAGCTGTGGC-3′, +20 to +3). The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles were followed by 1 cycle with a 10-min extension time. PCR products were subcloned using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. A minimum of 10 RACE clones was analyzed from each RNA sample. Construction of Luciferase Reporter Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—CYP4F3 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were made using the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). Defined segments of the 5′-flanking region of the CYP4F3 gene were amplified by PCR. KpnI and NheI sites were added to the 5′-ends of sense and antisense primers, respectively, and PCR products were ligated into the corresponding sites of pGL3 and sequenced. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the GeneEditor System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—HL60 cells were treated with 1.3% Me2SO for 4 days and electroporated with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at settings of 290 V and 960 microfarads. Each sample (2.3 × 107 cells/ml in complete growth medium plus 1.3% Me2SO, 300 μl/cuvette) was electroporated with 30 μg of pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmid, and 10 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1/Myc-His-LacZ, Invitrogen) was included as a control for transfection efficiency. HepG2 cells and COS 7 cells were grown to 50–60% confluency in 6-well plates and transfected using SuperFect Reagent (Qiagen). HepG2 cells were transfected with 1 μg of luciferase plasmid plus 1 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid/well. COS 7 cells were transfected with a total of 2.5 μg of DNA/well (0.5 μg of luciferase plasmid, 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase, 0.5 μg of CtBP expression vector, and 1 μg of ZEB expression vector); the total DNA added was made up to 2.5 μg with PCDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) in control experiments without expression vectors. HepG2 and COS 7 cell lysates were prepared in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) 48 h after transfection. HL60 cell lysates were prepared 14–18 h after the addition of DNA. Luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase assay system (Promega) and a luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity in each sample as determined by a β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). The results represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. Expression vectors for human ZEB-1 and ZEB-2 (in pCS2 with an N-terminal Myc epitope tag) were generous gifts from Dr. A. Postigo and Dr. D. Dean (5Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6391-6396Google Scholar). An expression vector for human CtBP-1 was a generous gift from Dr. R. Goodman (37Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897Crossref Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The wild type (WT) probe corresponds to a 38-bp region between positions –812 and –775 of the CYP4F3 promoter (5′-CACTCAGTAGGTGCTCTTTAAGAGCAGGTGTCACACAG-3′) and includes the putative bipartite ZEB binding site. The mutant probe has each AGGTG sequence converted to CCCGA (5′-CACTCAGTCCCGACTCTTTAAGAGCCCCGATCACACAG-3′). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed, and double-stranded oligonucleotides were then labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Nuclear extracts were prepared from COS 7 cells transfected with Myc-tagged ZEB-2 using the nuclear extract kit from ActiveMotif. The DNA binding assay (24-μl final volume) was carried out at 4 °C using a Gelshift Kit from ActiveMotif with buffers A1 and B1. The reaction contained 5 μg of nuclear extract and 100 pg of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (105 cpm). For supershift experiments, a mouse monoclonal antibody to c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was included in the DNA binding assay. A mouse monoclonal antibody to lamin A+B2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used as a negative control. The reaction mixtures were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel prepared in 0.25% TBE buffer, and the gel was then dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR-5 film for 10 h. CYP4F3 Expression in Human Bone Marrow—To understand the regulation of the CYP4F3 gene and its isoforms, we initially determined the expression of the CYP4F3 protein in different populations of developing hematopoietic cells. Non-erythroid nucleated bone marrow cells were isolated from four individual donors and stained with affinity-purified fluorescent-labeled anti-CYP4F3 for analysis by flow cytometry. Analysis of total non-erythroid bone marrow cells indicated that 40–60% expressed CYP4F3 protein (Fig. 1A), with 30–40% exhibiting high and 10–20% exhibiting intermediate fluorescence. To identify cell populations for further analysis, bone marrow cells were next broadly separated into the subdivisions R1, R2, and R3 (Fig. 1B) based on the properties of size (forward scatter) and granularity (side scatter). These populations were analyzed for CYP4F3 expression using rabbit IgG as a negative control (Fig. 1C). A small but consistent population of cells (3%) demonstrated positive staining for CYP4F3 in R1 (pink), the region of low forward scatter, and low side scatter that includes lymphocytes and early progenitors. The region R2 (green) includes a mixed population of cycling progenitors, monocytes, and maturing myeloid cells, and 64% of these cells were positive for CYP4F3. This region was further separated into the subdivisions R4, R5, and R6 (Fig. 1D), and a progressive increase in CYP4F3 expression (49, 66, and 76% positivity, respectively) was observed with increasing granularity (maturity). Cells with the highest levels of CYP4F3 expression were concentrated in R3 (red), a region of low forward scatter and high side scatter that is composed primarily of mature granulocytes (Fig. 2C). Essentially all of these cells (99%) were positive. The results indicate that expression of CYP4F3 is concomitant with myeloid maturation.Fig. 2Immunophenotypic characterization of CYP4F3 positive cells.A, each panel shows a representative double-labeling experiment for CYP4F3 and a selected marker and indicates % double-positive cells in total bone marrow. The thresholds of positivity were established by staining with negative control IgG. B, the percentage of cells expressing each marker in the CYP4F3 positive subpopulation was determined as an average of four experiments (error bars indicate S.D.). C, percentage of cells expressing CYP4F3 in populations positive for specific myeloid (CD15, CD11b, CD14), lymphoid (CD16, CD8, CD3), or stem cell (CD34) markers (error bars indicate S.D., n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next compared the expression of CYP4F3 in bone marrow to that of known myeloid proteins using a panel of antibodies against surface markers for hematopoietic differentiation and maturation in conjunction with anti-CYP4F3 (Fig. 2). A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2A. A high percentage of total bone marrow cells are double-positive for CYP4F3 and myeloid markers (for example, 48% CD33+, 37% CD11b+, and 32% CD15+ cells express CYP4F3). Less than 2% of cells are double-positive for CYP4F3 and lymphoid markers such as CD2, CD3, and CD8. Interestingly, this population of lymphocytes expressing CYP4F3 was consistently observed, and it is apparent that some of the cells have a high level of expression. The data presented for total bone marrow cells in Fig. 2A were quantified to determine the expression of each marker protein in the CYP4F3+ population (Fig. 2B). Most CYP4F3 positive cells (>90%) express myeloperoxidase (MPO) and CD33, and a high proportion of CYP4F3 positive cells express other myeloid markers including CD15 (72 ± 2%), CD38 (62% ± 2%), CD11b (54 ± 16%), CD13 (45 ± 12%), CD14 (15 ± 3%), and CD31 (14 ± 2%). In contrast, antigens associated with T and NK lymphocytes (CD2, CD3, CD8, and CD16) or hematopoietic progenitors (CD34) were only expressed in 0.7–2.5% of the CYP4F3+ cells. An alternative method of evaluating the data is shown in Fig. 2C; cells immunolabeled for specific myeloid and lymphoid surface marker antigens were analyzed to determine the percentage that express CYP4F3. An average of 92% CD15+, 80% CD11b+, 20% CD34+, 15% CD8+, and 10% CD3+ cells were positive for CYP4F3. Overall, the results confirm that CYP4F3 is expressed primarily in myeloid cells but indicate that it is also expressed in a small population of CD34+ progenitors and CD3+ T cells. To determine whether CYP4F3 is differentially expressed in maturing myeloid cells, we compared CYP4F3 and MPO expression in CD33+ gated populations (Fig. 3). Cells that were negative or low for MPO also had low expression of CYP4F3, and CYP4F3 expression increased in parallel with MPO. This is consistent with the increases in CYP4F3 fluorescence observed as a function of cell granularity (Fig. 1) and confirms that CYP4F3 expression is strongly associated with myeloid differentiation. Expression of CYP4F3 in Peripheral Blood Leukocytes—Flow cytometry was used to compare the expression level of CYP4F3 in different cell types in peripheral blood (Fig. 4). Granulocytes exhibit high fluorescence (Fig. 4A), whereas lymphocytes exhibit low fluorescence similar to negative control staining with IgG (Fig. 4B). When peripheral leukocytes were analyzed for myeloid and lymphoid markers that included CD15, CD14, CD3, and CD8, the results paralleled those in bone marrow in that essentially 100% of CD15+ and CD14+ cells but only ∼10% of CD3+ and CD8+ cells co-expressed CYP4F3 (not shown). A HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line exhibited intermediate fluorescence (Fig. 4C). Analysis of blood from two patients with eosinophilia gave identical results; CYP4F3 was expressed at highest levels in the eosinophils followed by neutrophils and then monocytes (Fig. 4, D and E). Eosinophilia samples were analyzed for CD16, CD45, and CD49D in addition to the markers listed above (not shown). Altenative Promoters Regulate Tissue-specific Expression of CYP4F3—We have previously shown that functionally distinct splice forms of CYP4F3 exhibit a tissue-specific distribution, with CYP4F3A expressed in neutrophils, and CYP4F3B expressed in liver (24Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Google Scholar, 25Christmas P. Jones J.P. Patten C.J. Rock D. Zheng Y. Cheng S.M. Weber B.M. Carlesso N. Scadden D.T. Rettie A.E. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38166-38172Google Scholar). We suggested that the 5′-UTR of CYP4F3 transcripts is also tissue-specific and might indicate the use of alternative promoters in different cell types (24Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Google Scholar). To further investigate this possibility, RNA samples from selected cell populations were analyzed by 5′-RACE to determine the sequence of the 5′-UTR and to identify the transcription start sites (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained in peripheral blood granulocytes, bone marrow myeloid cells isolated at early (BM-1, CD11b+ CD14–) or later (BM-2, CD11b+ CD14+) stages of development, and also HL60 cells; a single transcription initiation site was identified 519 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon (start site A). The 5′-UTR requires splicing to assume its location upstream of the ATG codon in mature myeloid transcripts, and the only variation observed relates to selection of the 5′-splice donor site. Two alternative splice junctions are used in bone marrow myeloid cells, apparently with similar efficiency, to generate 5′-UTRs of 40 or 34 bp. The 40-bp 5′-UTR was the only form observed in peripheral blood granulocytes. In HepG2 cells, transcription is initiated at a site located 71 bp upstream of the initiation codon (start site B), representative of the liver phenotype (24Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Google Scholar). The relative positions of transcription start sites A and B are shown schematically in Fig. 5B. We investigated whether the use of alternative start sites A and B in myeloid cells and liver was representative of the use of alternative tissue-specific promoters. To test this hypothesis 5′-flanking regions of the CYP4F3 gene were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector and transfected into HL60 cells differentiated with Me2SO or HepG2 cells (Fig. 5C). In HL60 cells, maximum luciferase expression was obtained using a promoter region that extends 350 bp upstream of start site A (construct A6). A different pattern was observed in HepG2 cells; the 350-bp region upstream of start site A has low activity (construct A6), whereas the region between start sites A and B has much higher activity (construct B3). Maximum luciferase expression in HepG2 cells was obtained using a promoter region that extends 630 bp upstream of start site B (construct B6). This construct includes start site A and overlaps the myeloid promoter, but it has low activity in HL60 cells, probably because splicing of exon 1 (the 5′-UTR) is required for luciferase expression in these cells. The splicing process may be impaired due to modification of the 3′-splice junction in promoter-luciferase constructs. Complete deletion of the 3′-splice junction abolishes activity in HL60 cells but has no significant effect in HepG2 cells (compare construct B6 with B4). Constructs A1-A8 were designed to eliminate a requirement for splicing after transcription initiation from start site A; exon 1of CYP4F3 (the myeloid 5′-UTR) is linked directly to the ATG initiation codon of luciferase. Initially, the two 5′-splice donor sites in exon 1 were excluded (constructs A1-A4). Subsequently, it was determined that the region containing these splice sites (position –500 to –468) was required for full transcriptional activity in HL60 cells (constructs A5-A8). In contrast, the 5′-UTR downstream of start site B is not required for activity in HepG2 cells (compare construct B3 to B5). The Myeloid Promoter Is Activated by ZEB-2 and CtBP—We initially sought to identify a role for known myeloid transcription factors in the regulation of CYP4F3 gene expression. Potential binding sites were predicted by inspection of the DNA sequence of the myeloid promoter (region –872 to –468) and are summarized in Table I. These include putative sites for the factors MZF-1 (based on the core sequence GGGGA, positions –602, –538, and –515)) and PU.1 (permissible variations of the GAGGAA core sequence, positions –575 and –518). Surprisingly, mutations to these sites did not reduce activity (Table"

Amyloidosis is an emerging category of diseases characterized by the extracellular accumulation of protein aggregates that share a common fibrillar conformation. The 20 proteins that can generate amyloid deposits in humans are extremely heterogeneous in function and structure, but, along the pathological transformation leading to aggregation and precipitation, all of them exhibit the same peculiar conformational pattern named cross-β structure, irrespective of the parent-starting arrangement (1Sunde M.

The lack of any sequence similarity and folding analogy among the amyloid-forming proteins led Dobson to conclude that the ability to form cross-β structure, wherein hydrogen bonds are formed between polypeptide chains in directions parallel to the fiber axis, is a generic property of polypeptide chains (2Dobson C.M.

Amyloidogenic lysozyme represents probably the most convenient and informative model of fibrillogenesis from a globular protein. Besides being, in fact, one of the best characterized enzymes, its fibrillogenic mechanism is not influenced by protein fragmentation; nor, to our knowledge, does the wild-type species generate amyloid deposits in vivo, even in the elderly. Thorough analysis of several biochemical properties of the amyloidogenic variants in comparison to the wild-type species showed that pathogenic lysozymes are less stable than wild-type (3Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B.

Biol. 2000; 130: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This thermodynamic destabilization correlates with an increased concentration of partly unfolded intermediates that self-aggregate into fibrillar polymers. In this study we present the biochemical and structural characterization of a new natural variant of human lysozyme, T70N (9Booth D.R. Pepys M.B. Hawkins P.N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 180Crossref Google Scholar), that displays the general properties of a less stable and less efficient enzyme in comparison to wild-type but does not undergo pathological fibrillar conversion in vivo. The T70N variant is present in the British population with an allele frequency of 5% (9Booth D.R. Pepys M.B. Hawkins P.N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 180Crossref Google Scholar). The comparison of the biochemical characteristics of this variant with those of the amyloidogenic species can highlight the role of some of the folding abnormalities identified in the pathogenic species. Clinical Studies—Genotyping for lysozyme T70N was performed as described previously (9Booth D.R. Pepys M.B. Hawkins P.N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 180Crossref Google Scholar) in 110 patients with systemic amyloidosis referred to the United Kingdom Centre for Amyloidosis, whose amyloid fibril type was initially uncharacterized but in whom the clinical phenotype was consistent with lysozyme amyloidosis. The variant was also sought in 23 patients with amyloid A amyloidosis and complicating rheumatoid arthritis and 60 patients with immunoglobulin light chain (AL) 1The abbreviations used are: AL, immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis; CD, circular dichroism; DQF-COSY, double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; MD, molecular dynamic; (NAG)3, β-1,4-linked trimer of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy. amyloidosis. Protein Expression—Mutagenesis, expression, and purification of human lysozymes were performed as described previously (3Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Equilibrium Denaturation—Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced unfolding of lysozymes was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence emission at 340 nm with excitation of 295 nm. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer LS50 spectrofluorometer at 20 °C using a 10-mm light path cell. The protein solution (0.01 mg/ml) was incubated for1hat increasing concentrations of GdnHCl in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The change of fluorescence as a function of denaturant concentration was analyzed according to the method described by Santoro and Bolen (10Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar) to determine the main thermodynamic parameters of the unfolding reaction. Thermal Unfolding—Far and near UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a JASCO 710 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature control system using 1- and 10-mm path length quartz cuvettes over the wavelength ranges 200–240 nm and 250–310 nm, respectively. The protein concentration was 200 μg ml–1 in H20, pH 5, and the CD data were expressed as mean residue ellipticity (θ). The measurements were collected at different constant temperatures from 20 to 90 °C. Equilibrium thermal unfolding of T70N lysozyme was monitored by ellipticity values at 222 and 270 nm and then normalized to the fraction of unfolded protein using f u = (θ–θN)/(θU-θN), where θ is the observed parameter and θN and θU are the ellipticities of the native and unfolded protein, respectively, extrapolated from the pre- and post-transition baselines at the corresponding temperatures. Enzyme Kinetics and Inhibitor Affinity—Lysozyme enzyme kinetics were determined with p-nitrophenol penta-N-acetyl-β-chitopentaoside (PNP-(GlcNAc)5) (11Nanjo F. Sakai K. Usui T. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (1 ml) containing 10 μg of each type of lysozyme, 0.1 unit of β-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase (NAHase), and various concentrations of PNP-(GlcNAc)5 (from 6 to 60 μm) in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 5.0, were incubated at 37 °C. The enzymatic reaction was stopped after 25 min by adding 2 m Na2CO3 (0.5 ml), and then the resulting free p-nitrophenol was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Affinity to the chitotriose (NAG)3 was estimated by fluorescence measurements (12Muraki M. Harata K. Jigami Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9212-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) on a PerkinElmer LS50 spectrofluorometer at 30 °C in MacIlvaine's buffer (100 mm citric acid and 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2). Protein concentration was adjusted to 3 μm. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 285 and 325 nm, respectively. Affinity constants were determined by plotting log (F o – F)/(F – F ∞) against log [S], where F o, F, and F ∞ are the fluorescence intensities of solutions of enzyme alone, enzyme in the presence of a concentration [S] of (NAG)3, and enzyme saturated with the inhibitor, respectively. Unfolding-Refolding Kinetics—Unfolding and refolding experiments were carried out with a Bio-Logic SFM3 stopped flow fluorometer by using an excitation wavelength of 285 nm and monitoring the total fluorescence emission change over 320 nm. All of the experiments were performed at 20 °C with a cell path length of 2.0 mm. For unfolding experiments, 1 volume of each type of protein in 20 mm acetate at pH 5.0 was 10-fold diluted with a solution containing 6 m GdnHCl at pH 5.0. The refolding reactions were carried out by mixing 1 volume of enzyme in 6 m GdnHCl with 10 volumes of 20 mm acetate at pH 5.0. NMR Spectroscopy and Modeling—NMR spectra were obtained at 500.13 MHz and 37 °C with a Bruker Avance spectrometer on 0.7–0.8 mm protein samples dissolved in H2O/D2O (95:5) or 99.9% D2O. No addition was done to adjust the uncorrected pH meter reading that was 4.2 for all measurements except for the isotope exchange and the conformational analysis experiments, where the values ranged between 4.5 and 4.9. A number of two-dimensional TOCSY (13Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3104) Google Scholar), DQF-COSY (14Piantini U. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1885) Google Scholar), and NOESY (15Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 286-292Crossref Scopus (4825) Google Scholar) spectra were acquired with the sculpting scheme for solvent suppression (16Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1539) Google Scholar) using selective pulses of 3–5 ms, 1.1 s steady state recovery time, mixing times (t m) of 20–50 ms for TOCSY and 100 ms for NOESY, t 1 quadrature detection by TPPI (17Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3520) Google Scholar), or States method (18States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) or gradient-assisted coherence selection (echo/anti-echo) (19Keeler J. Clowes R.T. Davis A.L. Laue E.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 145-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The spin-lock mixing of the TOCSY experiment was obtained with MLEV17 (20Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) or DIPSI-2 (21Shaka A.J. Lee C.J. Pines A. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 77: 274-293Google Scholar) pulse trains at γB2/2π = 9–10 kHz. The acquisitions were performed over a spectral width of 7002.8 Hz in both dimensions, with matrix size of 1024–2048 points in t 2 and 256–512 points in t 1 and 32–128 scans/t 1 free induction decay (FID). Selective one-dimensional NOESY experiments for temperature coefficient measurements were run by replacing the first two 90° pulses of the standard sequence with selective Gaussian-shaped pulses of 6 ms centered on the side-chain amide resonance of interest. The water resonance was suppressed by appending an excitation-sculpting module (16Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1539) Google Scholar) to the nonselective detection pulse. The acquisitions were performed between 33 and 40 °C by collecting 512 scans over 213 data points to monitor the chemical shift of the exchanging, unperturbed side-chain-amide resonance with sufficient precision (Δδ = ± 0.8 ppb). Isotope exchange data were collected in either forward (D2O) and backward mode (H2O) by consecutive acquisition of TOCSY spectra (2.5 h/spectrum in D2O and 15 min/spectrum in H2O) over variable time intervals from solvent addition (6, 12, or 24 h). For the fast acquisitions in H2O, only 80 t 1 increments were collected, and the standard linear prediction routine of Bruker software was employed to expand the indirect dimension to 200 data points with 40 coefficients prior to two-dimensional Fourier transform. Protection factors were obtained from the ratio between intrinsic (calculated) and apparent (experimental) isotope exchange rates. The intrinsic rates were computed through the parameters and procedures reported by Bai et al. (22Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). All spectra were referenced on the I106 CγH3 resonance at –0.61 ppm as reported previously (23Redfield C. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7201-7214Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Data processing and analysis were performed using Felix (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) software with shifted (60–90°) square sinebell apodization and polynomial baseline correction for NOESY data. Internuclear distances were quantified from the cross-peak volumes of the NOESY spectra using some cross-peaks from Trp-64 as calibrants. Tethered molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed by using the Discover software (Accelrys), following the default protocol for simulated annealing starting at a temperature of 600 K slowly lowered to 300 K (time step = 1 fs, 8.6 ps MD, 500 conjugate-gradient minimization steps) (24Dayringer H.E. Tramontano A. Sprang S.R. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Graph. 1986; 6: 82-87Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The selected force field was AMBER, and, to shorten the range of Coulomb interaction, a distance-dependent relative dielectric constant, ϵr, was used (ϵr(r) = 4r). Molecular structures were generated with Insight II (Accelrys). To assess and improve the accuracy of the NOE restraint set, the theoretical NOESY spectrum was back-calculated using the matrix doubling module of Felix (total correlation time, 2 ns) and compared with the experimental one. The restraints were subsequently refined, and a new MD was performed until good concordance was reached between theoretical and experimental NOESY spectra. T70N Lysozyme Is Not Amyloidogenic in Vivo—Several clinical and biochemical findings suggest that T70N lysozyme is not amyloidogenic. The allele frequency of T70N is relatively high in the normal population (5/100) (9Booth D.R. Pepys M.B. Hawkins P.N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 180Crossref Google Scholar). Both I56T and D67H are very rare and have only been identified in kindreds with amyloidosis wherein there is 100% penetrance (25Gillmore J.D. Booth D.R. Madhoo S. Pepys M.B. Hawkins P.N. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1999; 14: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). If T70N was as amyloidogenic as these variants, 5% of the British population might be expected to have amyloidosis. However, no individual with T70N lysozyme amyloidosis has ever been identified. This has been the case despite investigations designed to identify such individuals. Amyloid fibril type is ultimately identified in all patients presenting at the United Kingdom Centre for Amyloidosis. Prior to fibril identification, the prevalence of the T70N lysozyme allele was determined in patients with systemic amyloidosis, the clinical phenotype associated with I56T and D67H lysozyme amyloidosis. In these 55 patients, the T70N allele frequency was 0.08 (9/110 alleles, including one homozygote), similar to the allele frequency in the normal population. In all other patients with amyloidosis seen at the clinic, the fibril type had been characterized (except one, see below). In these eight patients carrying at least one T70N allele, the amyloid fibril type was subsequently identified as serum amyloid A (two patients), AL amyloid (four patients), not amyloidosis (one patient, the homozygote), and hereditary amyloidosis of unknown fibril type (one patient). In the one patient with hereditary systemic amyloidosis, the fibril protein has yet to be characterized. It is not lysozyme, and an individual in the kindred has the T70N lysozyme but not amyloid. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that T70N variant does not cause systemic amyloidosis in the British population. To test whether there was co-deposition of lysozyme within the amyloid fibrils created by other proteins, we have isolated the natural amyloid fibrils from amyloid deposits of one heterozygous T70N heterozygote patient clearly affected by AL amyloidosis. No lysozyme was detected in the fibrils by immunoblot. To test whether T70N lysozyme was interacting with other fibril types, the allele frequency in rheumatoid arthritis patients (2 T70N from 56 alleles) and AL (4/120) amyloidosis groups was compared. Asn-70 was not over- or under-represented, thus neither promoting nor inhibiting fibril formation. Finally, in the one subject homozygous for the mutation, serum lysozyme concentration was determined, and, according to the lysoplate method, the circulating protein was 12 mg/liter (nv 4–13 mg/liter.) Equilibrium Denaturation of T70N Lysozyme—The unfolding of the T70N variant was monitored at equilibrium by intrinsic fluorescence emission at 340 nm as a function of denaturant concentration at pH 6.5 and 20 °C. The unfolding curves for the wild-type, T70N, I56T, and D67H, normalized to the fraction of unfolded protein (f u), are shown in Fig. 1. All transitions are characterized by the presence of a single sharp change in the fluorescence intensity that is typical of cooperative transition in a two-state system. The transition midpoints are reduced, as compared with that of the wild-type protein, by 0.5, 0.9, and 1.3 denaturant concentration units for the T70N, D67H, and I56T, respectively. The data for the I56T and D67H variants are in good agreement with previous data of Takano et al. (6Takano K. Funahashi J. Yutani K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The values of ΔG H2O of unfolding, calculated according to Santoro and Bolen (10Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar), indicate that the three variants, T70N, D67H and I56T, are destabilized, in comparison to the wild-type, by 3.7, 4.7, and 7.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Thermal Unfolding—We have used circular dichroism to monitor T70N lysozyme unfolding behavior upon heating from 20 to 90 °C. The measurements were performed in the far and near UV regions (Fig. 2, a and b) to estimate the equilibrium thermal unfolding of the protein at pH 5. The coincidence of the two transition curves by the CD data at 222 and 270 nm, normalized to the apparent fraction of unfolded species (Fig. 2c), was observed over the entire temperature range studied. Such behavior is quite similar to the cooperative two-state unfolding displayed by the wild-type protein under these conditions (3Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), even if the midpoint of thermal denaturation of T70N variant is 3 °C below that of the wild-type lysozyme. From the analysis of CD measurements, there is no evidence of the existence of an intermediate state with a helical secondary structure but lacking tertiary interactions as was previously documented in the amyloidogenic species (3Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Enzyme Catalysis Performance—The enzyme kinetics data (Table I) suggest that T70N lysozyme has a reduced enzymatic activity with respect to wild-type, comparable with that reported for the D67H variant. This comparatively poor performance is the combined result of both a lower substrate affinity and a less efficient turnover. The reduced affinity of T70N for the chitotriose (NAG)3, the trisaccharide inhibitor of lysozyme, which can be inferred from the dissociation constant (K d) value of Table I, is also confirmed in D67H and I56T, but the T70N variant has the lowest affinity for (NAG)3 of the all natural human lysozyme variants.Table IComparative summary of the biochemical properties of the wild-type and three human lysozyme variantsProteinC maGdnHCl concentration of the midpoint of equilibrium denaturation; experimental error is ∼0.1 M.ΔG2HO bFree energy change in the absence of denaturant; experimental error is ∼10%.ΔΔG2HO cΔΔG2HO=ΔG2HO(mutant)-ΔG2HO(wildtype).Km dEnzyme activities determined with PNP-(GlcNAc)5; experimental errors are ∼20% for Km and 5% for k cat.k catdEnzyme activities determined with PNP-(GlcNAc)5; experimental errors are ∼20% for Km and 5% for k cat.Kd eDissociation constants for (NAG)3 obtained at pH 7.2 and 30 °C; values are mean ± standard deviation.k unffUnfolding rate constants determined at pH 5 with 5.4 M GdnHCl, and 20 °C; values are mean ± standard deviation.Mkcal·mol-1kcal·mol-1μMM·s-1μMs-1Wild type413.716.514.525 ± 50.0157 ± 0.002T70N3.49.993.713010158 ± 450.095 ± 0.014I56T2.46.477.2318.51546 ± 110.34 ± 0.03D67H2.88.994.71389.560 ± 122.04 ± 0.16a GdnHCl concentration of the midpoint of equilibrium denaturation; experimental error is ∼0.1 M.b Free energy change in the absence of denaturant; experimental error is ∼10%.c ΔΔG2HO=ΔG2HO(mutant)-ΔG2HO(wildtype).d Enzyme activities determined with PNP-(GlcNAc)5; experimental errors are ∼20% for Km and 5% for k cat.e Dissociation constants for (NAG)3 obtained at pH 7.2 and 30 °C; values are mean ± standard deviation.f Unfolding rate constants determined at pH 5 with 5.4 M GdnHCl, and 20 °C; values are mean ± standard deviation. Open table in a new tab Unfolding-Refolding Kinetics of Mutant Human Lysozymes—To assess the effects of the T70N substitution on the folding and unfolding kinetics, comparative stopped-flow kinetic studies of the reversible unfolding-refolding process were performed. The unfolding-refolding reactions were monitored by fluorescence intensity. The unfolding kinetics of T70N are described by a single exponential function, as reported previously (5Canet D. Sunde M. Last A.M. Miranker A. Spencer A. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6419-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 6Takano K. Funahashi J. Yutani K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The refolding reaction from the guanidine-denatured protein consists of two phases in which the fast phase is predominant, in amplitude, over the slow phase as shown previously (5Canet D. Sunde M. Last A.M. Miranker A. Spencer A. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6419-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 6Takano K. Funahashi J. Yutani K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). No significant differences were found between T70N variant and the wild-type protein in the rates of the refolding phases (data not shown). On the contrary, the unfolding process of the T70N is 3–4 times faster than that of the wild-type protein. Fig. 3 depicts the unfolding kinetics of wild-type, T70N, D67H, and I56T. The unfolding rates for the amyloidogenic mutants are consistent with the data reported previously by Canet et al. (5Canet D. Sunde M. Last A.M. Miranker A. Spencer A. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6419-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and Takano et al. (6Takano K. Funahashi J. Yutani K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and are, respectively, three and twenty times faster than that of the T70N variant. 1H NMR Chemical Shift Changes—Based on the assignments of wild-type human lysozyme (23Redfield C. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7201-7214Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and amyloidogenic variants (4Chamberlain A.K. Receveur V. Spencer A. Redfield C. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2525-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the 1H chemical shifts for all residues of the T70N lysozyme were carefully controlled (at least for the backbone resonances) by standard methodology (27Wüthrich K. NMR Spectroscopy of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). The deviations of the HN chemical shift values with respect to the wild-type protein are shown in Fig. 4a. Comparison with the corresponding histograms reported for the I56T and D67H mutants (4Chamberlain A.K. Receveur V. Spencer A. Redfield C. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2525-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggests that the T70N variant has a ΔδHN pattern somehow intermediate, i.e. whereas the extent of δHN deviations is generally limited, similar to I56T, a number of ΔδHN above the average are observed, as with D67H, for residues 52, 63, 64, 67, 72, and 77 (upfield) and residues 68, 69, 73, 76, and 79 (downfield). The interpretation of amide chemical shift changes may be complex and tricky, but there is no doubt that all of the variations seen with T70N are spread over the corresponding locations of the β-sheet, the subsequent loop, and the following 310 helix segment of the wild-type structure. For proteins, 1H NMR chemical shifts exhibit an established correlation with secondary structure only for Hα resonances (28Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). When compared with D67H, the δHα of T70N show meaningful differences only at positions 51, 61, 66, 68, 73, and 80 (Fig. 4b). In general, the accepted threshold for meaningful difference, i.e. ΔδHa ≥ ±0.1 ppm, refers to comparison with peptides in a statistically disordered conformation. Thus, to ascertain meaningfulness, the deviations of Fig. 4b were analyzed against the corresponding parameters obtained from the comparison with the wild-type protein data, which, in turn, were compared with the basic peptide shifts. In particular, on moving from the D67H to the T70N mutant, the downfield shifts at residues 51, 61, and 66 suggest that the conformation and extension of the β strands of the wild-type tend to be restored. Similarly, a recovery of the wild-type geometry at the end of the turn-like segment 70–73"

This agent is of particular interest because, unlike currently available regimes, it acts to sequester lymphocytes without causing cytotoxicity or blocking differentiation and growth potential. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism of action of FTY720, and identify its downstream effectors, we have screened genomic libraries and spontaneous mutants of the model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae for resistance to FTY720. We identified several proteins and pathways as being involved in the mechanism of action of FTY720. We show specifically that the two amino acid transporters TAT1 and TAT2, the two ubiquitin proteases UBP5 and UBP11, and the heat shock protein CAJ1 confer growth resistance to FTY720 when overexpressed. Another amino acid transporter, GNP1, and the ubiquitin structural gene UBI4 as well as the ubiquitin ligase RSP5, and its binding protein BUL1 confer growth resistance in a mutated form. Supporting the importance of amino acid transport in the growth resistance phenotype of S. cerevisiae to the immunosuppressive agent FTY720, a prototrophic strain was more resistant to FTY720 than the isogenic auxotroph. To further explore these results, the effects on amino acid uptake and protein degradation were measured in the presence of FTY720. Due to the high conservation of these proteins and pathways between yeast and humans, these results may provide valuable insights into the mechanism of action of FTY720 in lymphocyte sequestration in humans.

Current agents used for immunosuppression following organ transplant in humans (cyclosporin A, FK506, rapamycin) function to block T-cell activation and maturation by interfering with intracellular signaling pathways (1Suthanthiran M.

Shinomiya T. Immunology. 1996; 89: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). While these agents are effective in preventing transplant graft rejection, there is considerable room for improvement in extending graft survival before chronic graft rejection and in reducing the severe side effects associated with the depletion of immune system function. The novel compound FTY720 is unique in that it does not directly block T-cell activation, but indirectly prevents antigen recognition by causing the rapid and reversible sequestration of peripheral blood lymphocytes in the secondary lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (6Hoshino Y.

Enosawa S. Kakefuda T. Miyata M. Transplant. Int. 1997; 10: 343-349PubMed Google Scholar) and autoimmune type I diabetes (16Suzuki K. Yan X.-K. Amemiya H. Suzuki S. Hiromitsu K. Transplant. Proc. 1998; 30: 1043-1045Google Scholar) in animal models. The novel and unique mechanism of action of FTY720 provides beneficial and synergistic effects in the context of current immunosuppressive regimes. Despite these successes and intensive research efforts, the specific mechanism of action of this compound in human cells remains to be determined. FTY720 was first synthesized as a chemical derivative of myriocin, a natural product of the fungus Isaria sinclairii (9Adachi K. Kohara T. Nakao N. Arita M. Chiba K. Mishina T. Sasaki S. Fujita T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 853-856Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 35Fujita T. Inoue K. Yamamoto S. Ikumoto T. Sasaki S. Toyama R. Chiba K. Hoshino Y. Okumoto T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1994; 47: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Also an immunosuppressive agent, myriocin is shown to inhibit ceramide synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, leading to a reduction in the rate of intracellular transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (36Horvath A. Sutterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the murine cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell line CTLL-2, myriocin inhibited another lipid transferase, serine palmitoyltransferase. This inhibitory effect is suggested to be mediated by binding to murine LCB1 and LCB2, mammalian homologues of yeast proteins linked to sphingolipid biosynthesis (31Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 32Simon J.R. Treger J.M. McEntee K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressive activity of FTY720, however, is thought to be different from that of myriocin as it does not inhibit serine palmitoyltransferase activity and, also unlike myriocin, does not inhibit the mixed lymphocyte reaction (37Fujita T.

In the present study, we screened genomic libraries for multicopy suppressor genes, screened populations of spontaneous mutants, and performed biochemical analyses in the model system S. cerevisiae in a search for genes and genomic alterations capable of conferring resistance to FTY720-induced growth inhibition. We report that proteins involved in the ubiquitin protein degradation pathway, amino acid transport, and a heat shock protein are capable of reversing growth inhibition caused by exposure to FTY720 in yeast either when overexpressed or in a mutated form. Due to the high degree of homology between yeast and human genomes and the strong conservation of amino acid transport and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathways between these species, these data may provide insight to the mechanism of action of this exciting drug in humans and aid in the development of novel immunosuppressive agents.

All strains except those marked with an asterisk are isogenic to JK9-3dα.

D. Rose (Princeton), M. Carlson (Columbia University, New York) and J. Heitman (Duke University, Durham, NC). They were constructed, respectively, with the URA3-based 2-μ vectors YEP24, pSEY18 and pRS426. FTY720-resistant transformants were selected on minimal medium lacking uracil in the presence of 30 μm FTY720. The total number of transformants was >20,000. After the first selection, FTY720-resistant transformants were re-selected in YPD medium (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose) in the presence of 30 μm FTY720 at 30 °C. Plasmids conferring resistance to FTY720 were recovered as described (12Suzuki S. Enosawa S. Kakefuda T. Li X.-K. Mitsusada M. Takahara S. Amemiya H. Transplant. Immunol. 1996; 4: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), amplified, and reintroduced into JK9–3dα for the confirmation of the resistance. The inserts from the plasmids that conferred resistance were sequenced using the standard oligonucleotides M13 forward and reverse (pSEY18 vector), T3 and T7 (pRS426 vector), and 5′-AAC CGC ACC TGT GGC GCC GG-3′ and 5′-ACT TGG AGC CAC TAT CGA CT-3′ that flanked the inserts in the parent YEp24 vector. The DNA sequence was compared with the Saccharomyces Genome Database. Candidate genes TAT1, TAT2, UBP5, UBP11, and CAJ1 were subcloned from the initial multicopy suppressor clones into the 2-μm-based vector, pRS426 (Table II) using specific restriction enzymes and standard cloning procedures.Table IIList of the plasmids that were used in this studyCollectionPlasmidDescriptionSource/Ref.pCAW1PRS416CEN URA3ATCC companypCAW5pRS4262-μ URA3ATCC companypCAW6pRS426::TAT13.2-kb fragment containing TAT1 in pRS426This workpCAW7pRS426::TAT23.7kb EcoRI fragment containing TAT2 in pRS426This workpCAW8pRS426::UBP54.5kb SmaI-SalI fragment containing UBP5 in pRS426This workpCAW9pRS426::UBP113.4kb KpnI-XbaI fragment containing UBP11 in pRS426This workpCAW10pRS426::CAJ11.9kb KpnI-HindIII fragment containing CAJ1 in pRS426This workpCAW14PRS416::BUL1Subcloning of a 3.2kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment containing wild type BUL1This workpCAW15PRS426::HA-TAT13.2kb XhoI-NotI fragment containing HA-TAT1 in pRS426This workpAS55YEplac181::HA-TAT2HA-tagged TAT2 2micron plasmid22Beck T.

Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual, CSHL Press. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Spontaneous mutants were isolated by direct plating onto FTY720 containing plate. The survival ratio after ethylmethane sulfonate treatment was 48–67%. Untreated and ethylmethane sulfonate-treated yeast cells were plated on YPD in the presence of 30 μm FTY720 and FTY720-resistant colonies were selected. Construction of Genomic DNA Libraries from FTY720 Dominant-resistant Mutants—Total genomic DNA from dominant mutants and JK9-3dα parent strain was isolated using Genomic-tip System (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was subjected to partial Sau3AI digestion and fragments were fractionated in continuous sucrose gradients. 10- to 20-kb DNA fragments were collected and ligated into the BamHI site of the URA3 CEN-based vector pRS416. The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli strain TOP10F′ (Invitrogen). More than 105 independent transformants were pooled, and plasmid DNA was isolated. The mean insert size was 7–10 kb. Cloning of the Dominant Mutant Gene GNP1—JK9-3dα was transformed with the yeast genomic DNA library constructed from the dominant mutant. FTY720-resistant transformants were selected in YPD medium in the presence of 30 μm FTY720. The minimal size of the DNA fragment that conferred resistance to the drug was 2.9 kb and corresponded to the region from 1466012 to 1468658 on chromosome 4. The full sequence of the GNP1 gene was compared with the wild type sequence. Cloning of the Recessive Mutant Gene BUL1—FTY720 recessive mutant was transformed with the wild type genomic DNA library, and URA3+ transformants were selected on minimal plates lacking uracil. About 8,000 independent transformants were picked and FTY720-sensitive cells were selected on minimal plates in the presence of 30 μm FTY720. Plasmid DNA was isolated from FTY720-sensitive transformants, amplified, and re-introduced into the recessive resistant mutant for the confirmation of FTY720 sensitivity. Both extremities of the inserts were sequenced using the standard oligonucleotides T3 and T7 that flanked the inserts in the pRS416 vector. BUL1 gene was identified as the gene that could complement for the FTY720-resistant mutation. The mutation of BUL1 gene in the recessive mutant was confirmed by the determination of the DNA sequence. Construction of Bul1-disrupted Strain—pCAW14 (pRS416::BUL1) was doubly digested with SpeI/Eco47-3 restriction enzymes, and a 1.4-kb fragment containing the BUL1 gene was replaced by a G418 cassette generated by PCR on pFA6-KanMX4, with the oligonucleotides 5′-tgc atc act agt cgt acg ctg cag gtc gac gga-3′ and 5′-ata gcc agc gct atc gat gaa ttc gag ctc g-3′ containing sticky ends for SpeI and Eco47-3. The disruption fragment was generated by digesting this plasmid with XbaI and KpnI and was transformed into JK9-3dα strain. G418-resistant clones were selected and their genomic DNA extracted for PCR screening to check site-specific recombination. Lcb4, lcb5, and lcb4 lcb5 Mutants—The mutants were constructed using the PCR-based method as described previously (20Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar) using pFA6a (G418) plasmid (20Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar) and pAG32 (hygromycin) plasmid (21Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; PHS, phytosphingosine; PB, phenylbutyrate.-TAT1 and HA-TAT2 Plasmids—TAT1 protein tagging with the hemagglutinin protein HA1 was constructed as described for TAT2 (22Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). HA-TAT1 (in pRS426) encodes an N-terminal HA-tagged, fully functional TAT1 protein under the control of its own promoter. HA-TAT1 was constructed by ligating a 0.6-kb XhoI-XmaI-digested PCR product, containing the TAT1 promoter, 5′-untranslated region, initiation codon, and double HA-tag, to a 2.6-kb XmaI-NotI-digested PCR product containing the TAT1 open reading frame and 3′-noncoding region. The XhoI and NotI sites were natural sites of pRS426 where the TAT1 gene was subcloned for multicopy suppressor application flanking the TAT1 gene. The PCR primers used to generate the 0.6-kb fragment were: 5′-CAGGTCAATCCCGGG TGCATAGTCCGGGACGTCATAGGGATAGCCCGCATAGTCAGGAACATCGTATGGGTACATTTTTACGCCTTTTTATCGAG-3′ (XmaI site in bold italics, antisense 2×HA open reading frame is underlined, and antisense initiation codon is shown in bold) and the M13 standard primer (–40). The primers used to generate the 2.6-kb fragment were: 5′-CAGGTCAAT CCCGGG GACGATAGTGTCAGTTTCAT-3′ (XmaI restriction site in italics) and the M13 rev standard primer (–26). Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) or Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) were used for PCR. Introduction of the HA tag-encoding sequence in TAT1 was verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. The final product was labeled pCAW15 (Table II). Functionality of the HA-tagged TAT1 protein was checked by testing the ability of the cells containing the construction to grow in the presence of 30 μm FTY720. HA-TAT2-tagged protein cloned into the 2-μ-based vector YEplac195 was kindly given by M. N. Hall (22Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Amino Acid Uptake—The rate of import of radiolabeled tryptophan and leucine in the absence and presence of FTY720 in the JK9-3dα and the bul1 mutant strains were measured as described previously (23Heitman J. Koller A. Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schmidt A. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to early logarithmic phase in YPD medium and divided into two cultures. FTY720 was added to one of the two cultures at a final concentration of 30 μm. An equivalent volume of water was added to the control culture. The cultures were incubated with the drug for 4 h at 30 °C. Aliquots (3 × 0.5 ml) of the import reaction mixtures were withdrawn at time points 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min. The bound radioactivity was quantified using a scintillation counter and corrected for differences in cell density (optical density at 600 nm). Protein Analysis—To prepare whole cell extract for SDS-PAGE and Western analysis, cells were grown and treated for 1 h with 30 μm FTY720 in YPD medium to early logarithmic phase, re-suspended in ice-cold extraction buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and lysed with glass beads in a bead-beater with five pulses of 30 s. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by a short spin at 500 × g, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein microassay (Pierce). Samples were denatured at 37 °C for 15 min, and a total of 20 μg of protein was loaded per lane of SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) for Western blot analysis. Tagged proteins were detected using a mouse anti-HA antibody (clone 16B12; Berkeley Antibody Co.). Other Methods—Yeast were transformed using a LioAc procedure (24Gietz R.D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 8: 1425Crossref Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). FTY720 Inhibits Yeast Growth; Overexpression of the Genes TAT1, TAT2, CAJ1, UBP5, and UBP11 Rescue FTY720-induced Growth Inhibition—The minimum concentration of FTY720, which potently inhibited cell growth was 30 μm (Fig. 1). We then transformed JK9-3dα strain with three independent yeast genomic DNA plasmid libraries and screened FTY720-resistant colonies by selection on SD(-URA) plates containing 30 μm FTY720. From these transformations, roughly 200 resistant strains were isolated. Genomic inserts from each resistant colony were isolated and sequenced for comparison with the yeast genome. Overlapping multicopy plasmids were grouped yielding four independent genes, TAT1, CAJ1, UBP5, and UBP11, and subcloned as single gene in the initial plasmid. TAT2 was identified in a subsequent screening in rich medium (data not shown). TAT1 and TAT2 are low and high affinity tryptophan transporters, respectively (17Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 18Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Koller A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6597-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). CAJ1 is the yeast homologue of the E. coli DnaJ heat shock protein (25Mukai H. Shuntoh H. Chang C.D. Asami M. Ueno M. Suzuki K. Kuno T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with as yet unknown function in yeast. UBP5 and UBP11 are ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases of the de-ubiquinating enzyme family. These are reported to cause protein stabilization by the release of ubiquitin from target proteins. Conversely, these ubiquitin-specific proteases are proposed to stimulate protein breakdown by providing free and re-usable ubiquitin (26Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). The function of these two enzymes has not yet been clearly established in yeast. Dominant Mutation in the GNP1 Gene Confers Resistance to FTY720-induced Growth Inhibition—In addition to screening multicopy suppressor genes, we screened and isolated genomic mutants that showed resistance to FTY720-induced growth inhibition (see “Experimental Procedures”). Resistant strains were sorted as containing dominant or recessive mutations by back-crossing with the parent strain of the opposite mating type. Of these, one dominant mutation was characterized. To identify the mutant gene, a genomic DNA library was constructed from the mutant strain in the CEN-based vector pCAW1 (pRS416) and transformed into the sensitive parent strain. Plasmids from the resulting resistant clones were isolated and sequenced. The plasmids causing FTY720 resistance contained a gene encoding the glutamine transporter GNP1 (27Zhu X. Garrett J. Schreve J. Michaeli T. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with a single missense mutation at position 239 (W239L) (Fig. 2A). Analysis of this mutation using PEPPLOT software (Genetics Computer Group) predicted a change in the secondary structure of the protein (Fig. 2B). A mutation of the same residue (W239C) was previously demonstrated to alter the substrate specificity from glutamine to l-citrulline (28Regenberg B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because this mutation is dominant for FTY720 resistance, the possibility that the mutation causes loss-of-function was excluded. Disruption of the BUL1 Gene Confers Resistance to FTY720-induced Growth Inhibition—The recessive mutants resistant to FTY720 were classified into complementation groups to simplify the task of mutation characterization. The majority of mutants mapped into a single complementation group. From this group we focused on a single mutant for further study. Characterization of the mutation responsible for FTY720 resistance by genomic cloning identified BUL1 gene as the gene responsible for phenotype reversal. The mutation in this mutant turned out to be a partial deletion of the gene that started upstream from the promoter and extended roughly to the middle of the gene. Subsequent generation of a BUL1 gene-disrupted strain confirmed that the loss of function of BUL1 was responsible for resistance to FTY720-induced growth inhibition (Fig. 3A). Initially isolated as a binding protein of ubiquitin ligase RSP5 (29Yashiroda H. Oguchi T. Yasuda Y. Toh E. Kikuchi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3255-3263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), BUL1 is proposed to be involved in specifying ubiquitination substrates by binding RSP5 ligase under specific conditions (30Yashiroda H. Kaida D. Toh Kikuchi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reduction of Expression of RSP5 Confers Resistance to FTY720-induced Growth Inhibition—Because of the increasing evidence that the ubiquitin pathway is involved in the mechanism of action of FTY720, and because it is proposed to be the binding partner of BUL1, we determined whether a reduction in RSP5 expression would also lead to resistance to FTY720 (Fig. 3B). A mutant expressing ∼10% of endogenous RSP5 was resistant to FTY720, confirming that the BUL1-RSP5 complex was important in mediating FTY720 resistance. Both loss-of-function of BUL1 and reduction of RSP5 would lead to an overall reduction in the number of BUL1-RSP5 complexes and, presumably, a loss of ubiquitin ligase specificity and/or activity. UBI4 Disruption Confers Resistance to FTY720-induced Growth Inhibition—S. cerevisiae ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid protein encoded by four structural genes named UBI1, UBI2, UBI3, and UBI4. While each of these genes are reported to be expressed during yeast exponential growth, only UBI4 is shown to be strongly inducible by stress such as starvation, heat, and DNA-damaging agents (31Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 32Simon J.R. Treger J.M. McEntee K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For this reason, we chose to focus our studies on UBI4. A UBI4 deletion strain was tested for reduced sensitivity to FTY720. This strain also showed resistance (data not shown), further demonstrating the importance of ubiquitination in sensitivity to FTY720. Exposure to FTY720 Reduces Tryptophan and Leucine Uptake—Because the overexpression of two amino acid transporters conferred resistance to FTY720, we speculated that FTY720 would affect amino acid import. The uptake of radiolabeled tryptophan and leucine was measured over time in the auxotrophic parent and bul1-mutant strains in the absence and presence of FTY720 (Fig. 4). Imported amino acids were normalized to the number of cells as determined by optical density of the culture. A striking inhibition of uptake of both tryptophan and leucine was observed. The BUL1 mutant showed slightly improved uptake of tryptophan (27 versus 6.8% of untreated) and leucine (30 versus 13% of untreated) when compared with the parent strain. FTY720 Induces TAT1, but Not TAT2, Protein Degradation—The parent, bul1, and ubi4 mutant strains were transformed with HA-tagged TAT1 and TAT2 genes. Total protein was extracted from nontreated and FTY720-treated cultures (1 h) and analyzed by Western blot using anti-HA antibody. TAT1 protein levels decreased after treatment with FTY720 in both the parent and the bul1 mutant strains as well as in the mutant that does not express ubi4 (ubi4Δ) (Fig. 5A). Curiously, TAT2 protein levels were increased in the parental strain following FTY720 exposure and showed enhanced level in the BUL1 mutant strain with and without exposure to FTY720 (Fig. 5B). This could be directly related to the loss of ubiquitination specificity presumed in the bul1 mutant strain. Without adequate BUL1-RSP5 complexes, TAT2 protein turnover could be blocked, leading to accumulation of the protein. The absence of UBI4 protein prevented the increase of TAT2 observed in both the parent and bul1 mutant strains upon treatment with FTY720. In addition TAT2 protein level was higher in the ubi4 mutant than in the parent strain, indicating a potential regulatory role of ubiquitin on TAT2 protein level. Although both TAT1 and TAT2 ge"

Oligomerization-induced conformational changes may be necessary to modulate the kinetic properties of RTKs and render them fully functional. To investigate this regulatory mechanism, recombinant TPR-MET, a functionally active oncoprotein derivative of the RTK c-MET, has been expressed and purified for quantitative enzymatic analysis. This naturally occurring oncoprotein contains the cytoplasmic domain of c-MET fused to a coiled coil motif from the nuclear pore complex (TPR). cytoMET, the monomeric analog of TPR-MET, has also been expressed and purified for comparative enzymatic analysis.

Binding of a cognate extracellular ligand to a monomeric RTK induces receptor oligomerization and, in turn, autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor (1Schlessinger J.

The phosphorylated form of the receptor recruits signaling molecules through Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains, and subsequent activation of these molecules initiates intracellular signaling cascades (1Schlessinger J.

Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). The molecular details of how RTK oligomerization regulates its function are incompletely understood. It is known that receptor oligomerization enhances autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the kinase regulatory domain and that this phosphorylation results in localized conformational changes that increase the kinase activity of the receptor (5Murray B.W. Padrique E.S. Pinko C. McTigue M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10243-10253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Mol. Cell.

However, regulatory domain phosphorylation, although necessary, may not be sufficient to fully activate the kinase (8Sherrill J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Additional oligomerization-induced conformational changes may be necessary to increase the kinase catalytic activity and render the RTK fully functional. Evidence for this level of regulation is provided by studies with phosphatase inhibitors such as peroxovanadate compounds. Posner et al. (7Posner I. Engel M. Levitzki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20638-20647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that unstimulated insulin receptors possess basal kinase activity but are unable to fully mimic ligand-stimulated insulin receptor autophosphorylation and signaling in cultured hepatoma cells or hepatic microsomes following peroxovanadate treatment (10Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-sun G. Fantus I. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, pervanadate treatment of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor is able to induce autophosphorylation in the absence of PDGF but is unable to increase the activity of the receptor toward exogenous substrate without the presence of PDGF (9Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Studies with polyclonal antibodies have qualitatively shown that a phosphorylated monomeric receptor does not possess the ability to phosphorylate exogenous substrate in the same manner as the oligomeric receptor (8Sherrill J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All of these studies would indicate that there is some unique functional characteristic contained within the oligomeric RTK that is not present in the monomeric receptor. Biochemical characterization of RTKs has been performed using both recombinant truncated kinase domains and cytoplasmic domains (5Murray B.W. Padrique E.S. Pinko C. McTigue M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10243-10253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Naldini L.V.E. Ferracini R. Longati P. Gandino L. Prat M. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell.

Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 311-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the isolated kinase domain may not be a sufficient model for receptor function. Murray et al. (5Murray B.W. Padrique E.S. Pinko C. McTigue M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10243-10253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were able to determine kinetic parameters for phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Tie2 cytoplasmic kinase domain and showed that phosphorylation resulted in a 2–5-fold decrease in substrate K m. Parast et al. (12Parast C.V. Mroczkowski B. Pinko C. Misialek S. Khambatta G. Appelt K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16788-16801Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) also showed an order of magnitude increase in the catalytic activity of the phosphorylated VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase domain versus the non-phosphorylated receptor. These studies demonstrated the importance of the phosphorylation state of RTKs in modulating their kinase activity, but they did not address the issue of oligomerization. The question remains, does the activity of phosphorylated RTK monomer accurately represent the ligand-activated state of the RTK? If not, what are the differences between the oligomeric and monomeric forms of the receptor? The TPR-MET oncoprotein provides a unique opportunity to address this question. TPR-MET is a naturally occurring oncoprotein resulting from a fusion between TPR (a coiled-coil domain derived from the nuclear pore complex) and the cytoplasmic domain of c-MET (6Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6711-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 15Cooper C.S. Park M. Blair D.G. Tainsky M.A. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Vande Woode G.F.

Biochem. 1996; 61: 49-60Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). c-MET, the RTK for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, has been shown to be involved in angiogenesis, placental and liver development, B-cell differentiation, and embryogenesis, and altered c-MET function has been implicated in multiple neoplastic disorders (17Van der Voort R. Taher T.E.T. Derksen P.W. Spaargaren M. Van der Neut R. Pals S.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 79: 38-90Google Scholar). Targeted overexpression of c-MET has also been shown to cause hepatocellular carcinoma in transgenic mice (18Liang T.J. Reid A.E. Xavier R. Cardiff R.D. Wang T.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The TPR-MET oncoprotein is oligomerized through the TPR domain, which results in a constitutively active tyrosine kinase (6Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6711-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) that has the ability to produce mammary hyperplasia and carcinoma, as well as multiple other neoplasms in transgenic mice (18Liang T.J. Reid A.E. Xavier R. Cardiff R.D. Wang T.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The isolated cytoplasmic domain of c-MET (cytoMET) has kinase activity; however, this protein cannot transform NIH3T3 cells and is, therefore, functionally inactive (6Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6711-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These studies suggest there may be kinetic differences between functionally active TPR-MET and functionally inactive cytoMET. Here we present a detailed analysis that conclusively shows phosphorylated TPR-MET and phosphorylated cytoMET have significantly different kinetic properties. Because these two proteins differ in their oligomerization state, this implies that oligomerization-induced conformational changes modulate the activity of RTKs, and these changes are necessary to fully activate the receptor.

Anti-human Met antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (sc-161), and anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) and the anti-phosphorylated MET activation loop antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Construction of Recombinant Baculovirus Vectors—The tpr-met oncogene was a gracious gift from Dr. Morag Park (McGill University). Both tpr-met and cytomet were amplified using PCR of the tpr-met containing pXM vector. A carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag and BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were added during PCR. The PCR product was gel-purified, digested, and ligated into the pFastBac shuttle plasmid. The sequence was verified in the shuttle plasmid using automated sequencing (UTMB Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory). Clones with verified sequences were transformed into DH10Bac cells; transposition into baculovirus DNA was monitored by loss of β-galactosidase activity. Recombinant baculovirus DNA was purified by isopropanol precipitation and successive ethanol washes and used for transfection of confluent Sf9 cells. The recombinant baculovirus obtained from the Bac-to-Bac cloning protocol was amplified to a titer of >1 × 108 pfu/ml before infections for protein expression. Amplifications were carried out using 5 × 105cells/ml and a multiplicity of infection of 0.05 for 96 h at 27 °C. Titer was verified using serial dilution plaque assays in duplicate. Protein Expression and Purification—Both TPR-MET and cytoMET proteins were expressed and purified using similar protocols. Sf9 insect cell lines were propagated at 27 °C in spinner flasks using SF-900II serum-free medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.5× antibiotic/antimycotic; cell density was maintained between 5 × 105 and 3 × 106 cells/ml for propagation. Protein expression was initiated by infecting Sf9 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Cells were pelleted 72 h post-infection and stored at –78 °C. Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice, resuspended with chilled TBSC (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS) supplemented with 1 mm DTT and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture, and lysed in a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen). After binding, the beads were washed successively with TBSC + 250 mm NaCl and TBSC + 500 mm NaCl + 5 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted with TBSC + 500 mm imidazole. Purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE with the resulting bands visualized with Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at A 280, with molar extinction coefficients calculated from the aromatic residue content of the proteins (19Gill S.C. von Hippel P H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). To ensure complete autophosphorylation of the recombinant kinases, the eluent was dialyzed at 4 °C against PBSC (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with 50 μm ATP, 25 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm MnCl2. A second dialysis was performed against PBSC and 5 mm EDTA. After dialysis, the proteins were further purified over a gel filtration column (Phenomenex BIO-SEP SEC-3000 column) in PBSC + 5 mm EDTA or an anion exchange (POROS 10HQ) column with salt as the eluent. Both proteins were characterized with gel filtration chromatography (Phenomenex BIO-SEP SEC-3000 column) to determine their oligomerization state. Fluorescence Studies of TPR-MET and cytoMET—Binding of MANT-AMPPnP (fluorescent-tagged non-hydrolyzable ATP) to purified TPR-MET and cytoMET was measured using a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer, model FL3–22. Quenching of the fluorescence from the five common tryptophan residues found in both TPR-MET and cytoMET was measured for increasing concentrations of MANT-AMPPnP. All data were measured at 10 °C with an excitation wavelength (λexc)of290 nm, and emission data were collected from 300 to 387 nm for both the sample and a reference cuvette with buffer and ligand. Fluorescence was corrected for inner filter effects by measuring the absorbance of the protein/ligand solutions at the excitation and emission wavelengths. The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence occurring upon the addition of MANT-AMPPnP was assumed to be proportional to the amount of protein-bound MANT-AMPPnP present. The data were fitted using the following equation to obtain dissociation constants: ΔF/F o = 1 – {(Q[MANT-AMPPnP])/(K d + [MANT-AMPPnP])}. Where ΔF represents the fluorescence of the sample minus the background cuvette, F o is the initial protein fluorescence in the absence of ligand, Q is the maximum quenching of the protein during the experiment, and K d is the dissociation constant. The data were plotted as ΔF/Fo versus [MANT-AMPPnP] and fit using non-linear least squares regression analysis to the above equation with the GraphPad Prism program and K d and Q as fitting parameters. To determine the dissociation constant for ATP (K d,ATP), titrations of enzyme with MANT-AMPPnP were performed in the presence of a fixed amount of ATP. The K d,ATP can then be determined by solving the equation: K d, apparent = K d,MANT{1 – ([ATP]/K d,ATP)}. To determine total active protein, the quenching of total fluorescence was assumed to be proportional to the amount of MANT-AMPPnP bound to the protein, and the dissociation constant was determined in independent experiments. The total protein ([E t]) can then be found by solving the quadratic equation: (1 – ΔF)/(1 – ΔF max) = {([E t] + [MANT-AMPPnPt] + K d) – (([E t] + [MANT-AMPPnPt] + K d)2 – 4[E t][MANT-AMPPnPt])1/2}/(2[E t]). Kinetic Assays—All kinetic assays were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted. Ni-NTA-purified TPR-MET (or cytoMET) was pre-incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate) with 1 μm ATP and 10 mm freshly prepared DTT added. Kinase reactions were carried out in kinase reaction buffer supplemented with 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 pmol [γ-32P]ATP and 1 mm DTT, with ATP and tyrosine-containing substrate added to desired concentrations. Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme (final concentration 1–10 nm) to a complete reaction mixture. At time points during the steady state linear range of the reaction, aliquots were removed from the reaction mix, quenched with 5 m guanidine hydrochloride, and applied to streptavidin-coated polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (SAM2 biotin capture membrane; Promega). The membranes were sequentially washed with 2 m NaCl, 2 m NaCl + 1% H3PO4, distilled water, and 70% EtOH. Membranes were dried, and incorporated radioactivity was measured using Cerenkov counting on a Hewlett Packard LS300 liquid scintillation counter. Non-weighted least squares linear regression lines were calculated for the linear range of each of individual reaction, and the program GraphPad Prism was used to calculate steady state rates. Each time point was measured in duplicate, and each linear range contained from four to eight points. Kinetic parameters were calculated from nonlinear least squares fitting to a Michaelis-Menten equation using the program GraphPad Prism. Inhibitor Studies—To determine the K I of the known ATP competitive inhibitor staurosporin, linear ranges were calculated (as described above) in the presence of a known amount of inhibitor. Staurosporin was initially dissolved to a final concentration of 1 mm in Me2SO and then subsequently diluted into kinase reaction buffer at the desired final concentration. Steady state rates were compiled to generate rate curves, and unweighted non-linear least squares regression analysis was used to determine Kmapp . Determining this value at multiple inhibitor concentrations allowed calculation of K I by comparing to the previously calculated K m for ATP using the formula: KI=[I]/((Kmapp/Km)-1) (22Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1975: 100-107Google Scholar). Purification of TPR-MET and cytoMET—The expression of carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine-tagged TPR-MET and cytoMET in Sf9 cells was accomplished by infection with recombinant baculovirus as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both proteins were isolated from the soluble fraction of the cell lysate and were purified to ∼95% homogeneity as evaluated by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2). Fig. 2B shows a Western blot analysis of both TPR-MET and cytoMET after purification. Both proteins positively react against a commercially available anti-human c-MET antibody that was derived from a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal tail of the c-MET receptor. Both TPR-MET and cytoMET are phosphorylated as demonstrated from their recognition by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and an antibody specific for the phosphorylated activation loop of cMET. Furthermore, incubation of this phosphorylated enzyme with [γ-32P]ATP revealed no further incorporation of phosphate into either TPR-MET or cytoMET. This result is expected, because both proteins were incubated from 4 h to overnight at 4 °C with ATP and MgCl2 during the purification process (see “Experimental Procedures”). Enzymatic characterization showed that kinetic variables for each enzyme recovered after elution from either the Ni-NTA or gel filtration columns were similar (data not shown). Both proteins were subjected to analysis on gel filtration columns to determine their oligomerization state. TPR-MET (molecular mass, ∼62 kDa) eluted at a volume corresponding to an observed molecular mass between 100 and 250 kDa; no protein was apparent in the void volume or in fractions corresponding to monomer molecular mass. This size range would correspond to an oligomer of a dimer, trimer, or tetramer for the TPR-MET protein. Different concentrations of TPR-MET were used in the kinase assays, and each time identical K m,ATP and K m,peptide were obtained. Thus, even if multiple oligomerization states were present their kinetic properties were identical. cytoMET (molecular mass, ∼43 kDa) eluted at a volume corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼40 kDa, consistent with a monomeric cytoMET species. Binding Studies—Binding studies of TPR-MET and cytoMET for MANT-AMPPnP allowed determination of substrate affinities and subsequent determination of the binding active enzyme fraction in the purified protein samples. The latter measurement is necessary to accurately determine the k cat value for TPR-MET and cytoMET. The quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence by MANT-AMPPnP was measured for both phosphorylated TPR-MET and cytoMET. Four of the five tryptophan residues are within the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain of the both TPR-MET and cytoMET, as determined by sequence analysis and comparison with the known structure of the insulin receptor (20Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5573-5581Crossref Scopus (787) Google Scholar). These residues were accessible to quenching by the MANT nucleotide whose absorption maximum at 355 nm overlaps with the tryptophan emission maximum in both TPR-MET and cytoMET at 335 nm. A fixed amount of protein was titrated with increasing amounts of MANT-AMPPnP, and the quenching was followed from 300 to 387 nm, to avoid interference with MANT emission (Fig. 3A). The area under the curve was integrated, and, after inner filter effects were accounted for, normalized fluorescence was plotted against [MANT-AMPPnP], and the data were fit with non-linear least squares regression analysis (Fig. 3, B and C). Results from the binding studies are listed in Table I. The binding constants for MANT-AMPPnP (K d,MANT) are 9.1 μm for TPR-MET and 8.7 μm for cytoMET, which are statistically identical for the two enzymes. To determine ATP binding constants (K d,ATP), the titrations were repeated with 10 μm ATP added. The apparent K d with ATP present, when coupled to the known K d,MANT can yield the K d,ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This analysis reveals a slight decrease in K d,ATP when comparing the oligomeric TPR-MET to the monomeric cytoMET indicating an oligomerization-dependent change in the conformation of the ATP binding site, independent of phosphorylation of the activation loop.Table IBinding of TPR-MET and cytoMetKd (±S.E.)MANT-AMPPnPATPμMTPR-MET9.13 (1.2)5.7 (0.58)CytoMET8.77 (0.89)17.5 (1.9)p value0.80.02 Open table in a new tab Kinetic Activity—To ensure complete autophosphorylation of the enzymes and to separate the autophosphorylation reaction from the exogenous substrate kinase reactions, both TPR-MET and cytoMET were separately incubated with ATP, MgCl2, and MnCl2 prior to use in kinetic studies. The steady state kinetic properties of the fully phosphorylated form of TPR-MET and cytoMET with respect to ATP and exogenous tyrosine substrates were examined. TPR-MET and cytoMET were both recognized by phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies before the kinase reaction. However, neither enzyme underwent additional autophosphorylation during the course of these reactions, as demonstrated by the inability of either enzyme to incorporate phosphate from radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). It was also necessary to maintain adequate reducing conditions (DTT concentration > 1mm) to ensure full activity of the kinases. Thus, both enzymes were reduced and fully phosphorylated before determining their kinetic properties with exogenous substrates. The steady state linear range for formation of phosphorylated exogenous substrate occurred between 2 and 50 min for both phosphorylated TPR-MET and cytoMET. This range is similar to the linear range reported for ligand-stimulated immunoprecipitated c-MET (11Naldini L.V.E. Ferracini R. Longati P. Gandino L. Prat M. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Linear ranges were analyzed using an unweighted linear least squares regression analysis within the GraphPad Prism program (see Fig. 4A and 5A). For each reaction, between four and eight separate time points were examined in duplicate to determine the reaction rate; all regression lines fit the data with r 2 values greater than 0.9. Fig. 4A and Fig. 5A show representative kinetic data with fixed enzyme and ATP concentrations and increasing SignaTECT 1 peptide concentrations. The slopes of the calculated regression lines provided steady state velocities from which to construct Michaelis-Menten rate curves (see Fig. 4B and Fig. 5B) for SignaTECT 1. An identical method was used to construct rate curves for the tyrosine-containing peptide substrate, PepTyr-489, and ATP (see Fig. 4, C and D and Fig. 5, C and D). Each data point in the Michaelis-Menten rate curves represents the mean of two to five independent experiments. Michaelis-Menten equations were fit to the experimental data using unweighted non-linear least squares regression, and kinetic parameters were derived from the curve for each kinase reaction.Fig. 5Kinetic data for cytoMET. The linear range of the kinase reaction is shown in panel A. SignaTECT 1 was used at the indicated concentrations with ATP being held constant at 400 μm. Each time point was measured in duplicate for a given experiment with the data representing the mean ± S.D. Panels B–D show rate curves for indicated substrates derived from linear ranges as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point on a given rate curve represents one to five independent experiments at that given concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W2026982289,"Caenorhabditis elegans can serve as a model system to study telomere functions due to its similarity to higher organisms in telomere structures. We report here the identification of the nematode homeodomain protein CEH-37 as a telomere-binding protein using a yeast one-hybrid screen. The predicted three-dimensional model of the homeodomain of CEH-37, which has a typical helix-loop-helix structure, was similar to that of the Myb domain of known telomere-binding proteins, which is also a helix-loop-helix protein, despite little amino acid sequence similarity. We demonstrated the specific binding of CEH-37 to the nematode telomere sequences in vitro by competition assays. We determined that CEH-37 binding required at least 1.5 repeats of TTAGGC and that the core sequence for binding was GGCTTA. We found that CEH-37 had an ability to bend telomere sequence-containing DNA, which is the case for other known telomere-binding proteins such as TRF1 and RAP1, indicating that CEH-37 may be involved in establishing or maintaining a secondary structure of the telomeres in vivo. We also demonstrated that CEH-37 was primarily co-localized to the chromosome ends in vivo, indicating that CEH-37 may play roles in telomere functions. Consistent with this, a ceh-37 mutation resulting in a truncated protein caused a weak high incidence of male phenotype, which may have been caused by chromosome instability. The identification of CEH-37 as a telomere-binding protein may represent an evolutionary conservation of telomere-binding proteins in terms of tertiary protein structure rather than primary amino acid sequence. Caenorhabditis elegans can serve as a model system to study telomere functions due to its similarity to higher organisms in telomere structures. We report here the identification of the nematode homeodomain protein CEH-37 as a telomere-binding protein using a yeast one-hybrid screen. The predicted three-dimensional model of the homeodomain of CEH-37, which has a typical helix-loop-helix structure, was similar to that of the Myb domain of known telomere-binding proteins, which is also a helix-loop-helix protein, despite little amino acid sequence similarity. We demonstrated the specific binding of CEH-37 to the nematode telomere sequences in vitro by competition assays. We determined that CEH-37 binding required at least 1.5 repeats of TTAGGC and that the core sequence for binding was GGCTTA. We found that CEH-37 had an ability to bend telomere sequence-containing DNA, which is the case for other known telomere-binding proteins such as TRF1 and RAP1, indicating that CEH-37 may be involved in establishing or maintaining a secondary structure of the telomeres in vivo. We also demonstrated that CEH-37 was primarily co-localized to the chromosome ends in vivo, indicating that CEH-37 may play roles in telomere functions. Consistent with this, a ceh-37 mutation resulting in a truncated protein caused a weak high incidence of male phenotype, which may have been caused by chromosome instability. The identification of CEH-37 as a telomere-binding protein may represent an evolutionary conservation of telomere-binding proteins in terms of tertiary protein structure rather than primary amino acid sequence. Telomeres, the specialized nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes, are essential for the maintenance of chromosome integrity since they provide protection from exonucleolytic degradation and prevent fusion between chromosome ends (1Blackburn E.H.

Telomeres in most eukaryotes are composed of tandem repeats of short sequence elements, typically 5–8 bp in length. The strand of the telomere that contains the 3′ terminus is usually rich in G residues, and it extends beyond the complementary C-rich strand to terminate as a single-stranded 3′ overhang in several evolutionarily divergent organisms. The integrity and proper functions of telomeres rely upon associations between the telomeric repeats and specific binding proteins. Among such proteins, a group of proteins specifically bind to the double-stranded repeats. In mammalian cells, two homologous double-stranded telomere-binding proteins, TRF1 and TRF2, have been identified (5Zhong Z. Shiue L. Kaplan S. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4834-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Chong L. van Steensel B. Broccoli D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Hanish J. Tempst P. de Lange T.

The Schizosaccharomyces pombe Taz1 protein is proposed to be a functional homolog of the human TRF proteins (9Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 10Spink K.G. Evans R.J. Chambers A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In plants, Myb domain-containing proteins have been identified as telomere-binding proteins (11Yu E.Y. Kim S.E. Kim J.H. Ko J.H. Cho M.H. Chung I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24208-24214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Hwang M.G. Chung I.K. Kang B.G. Cho M.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1 protein is also a double-stranded telomere-binding protein (13Conrad M.N. Wright J.H. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Rap1p contains two Myb-like domains, and TRF1, TRF2, and Taz1p each contain a single Myb-like domain at the C terminus. It is worth noting that proteins recently added to the list of telomere-binding proteins were initially identified as having Myb-like domains (for example, 11,12). The idea that proteins implicated in telomere protection are evolutionarily conserved at the functional level rather than the amino acid sequence level has gained momentum (for example, Ref. 14Mitton-Fry R.M. Anderson E.M. Hughes T.R. Lundblad V. Wuttke D.S. Science. 2002; 296: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We wished to extend the understanding of universal mechanisms of telomere protection and functions using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. C. elegans can serve as a model system to study telomere functions because it has typical telomeric repeats ranging from 4 to 9 kb (15Wicky C. Villeneuve A.M. Lauper N. Codourey L. Tobler H. Muller F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8983-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and it has many advantages in molecular genetic approaches such as its complete genome, short life cycle, and many molecular tools available. However, no telomere-binding protein has been identified in C. elegans. As a first step toward the studies of telomere functions in the nematode, we identified a telomere-binding protein in C. elegans. We undertook the yeast one-hybrid approach to avoid any bias toward proteins that have amino acid similarity to known telomere-binding proteins. The nematode telomeric DNA consists of TTAGGC repeats, a sequence motif that differs from that of mammals and plants. A protein identified in this screen, CEH-37, has a structural domain similar to the homeodomain but lacks a Myb-like domain. We show that the homeodomain of CEH-37 is structurally similar to the Myb domain of known telomere-binding proteins despite their primary sequence dissimilarities. We also show that CEH-37 specifically binds nematode double-stranded telomere DNA and bends telomere-containing DNA. We demonstrate that CEH-37 is primarily localized to the chromosome ends in vivo. Finally, we show that CEH-37 is required for chromosome stability in vivo, acting together with mrt-2, a checkpoint protein gene acting on the telomeres. Yeast One-hybrid Screening—For one-hybrid screening, we used (TTAGGC)26 repeats placed upstream of the HIS3 reporter gene in pAS2-KSH as a bait and a random-primed C. elegans cDNA library (provided by R. Barstead) as the source of prey. Positive clones were selected on SD/–His/–Trp/–Leu medium containing 33 mm 3-aminotriazole. Gel Shift Assay—We prepared probes from a (TTAGGC)6 fragment excised from pGEM-TE and from various repeats of the telomere oligomer. To reduce nonspecific binding, in vitro translated recombinant proteins were preincubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.5 μg of nonspecific double-stranded DNA. Radioactive probe was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Total binding mixtures were loaded on 5–8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and subjected to electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE (54 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA). The binding reaction was monitored by autoradiography and by analysis with a Fuji phosphorimaging device. Construction and Expression of CEH-37 Derivatives—To perform domain studies of CEH-37, we generated deletion derivatives of CEH-37 by PCR. We designed the PCR primers so that they could amplify the N-term 1The abbreviations used are: N-term, N-terminal; C-term, C-terminal; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ORF, open reading frame; h, human. (N-terminal region) domain (1st–37th amino acids of CEH-37), the homeodomain (38th–94th amino acids), and the C-term (C-terminal region) domain (95th–278th amino acids of the protein). The following oligonucleotides were used as primers for PCR: D1 (5′-GGGATCCGACCAGCTATAGTTACTTCAC-3′), D2 (5′-GGGATCCTCGGAAGAATCGTCGCGAACG-3′), D3 (5′-GGAAGCTTAAGTACCGCCTCCAAGAG-3′), D4 (5′-GGAAGCTTTCAGATCATTGCTGCATTG-3′), D5 (5′-GCTCGAGGTTGCTTCATTTTGGTTTTTG-3′), and D6 (5′-GCTCGAGTTACAAATTATTTCCATTTG-3′). The PCR products were subcloned into the pRSET vector (Invitrogen). The subclones containing the full-length and deletion derivatives of the ceh-37 cDNA (N, N-H, N-C, and H) were translated using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). In the case of coexpression of the full-length and N-terminal domains, the two templates were mixed and co-translated. For yeast one-hybrid assays, the PCR fragments were cloned into the pACT vector (Clontech). Yeast One-hybrid Assay—We transformed each ceh-37 deletion derivative constructed in pACT (Clontech) into the yeast strain CG-1945 (Clontech) transformed previously with the bait construct. Equivalent numbers of transformants were spread on selective media (SD/–His/–Trp/–Leu containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole) or nonselective media (SD/–Trp/–Leu). The ratio of the number of colonies on selective and on nonselective media was taken as a measure of the viability of each deletion derivative under selection for the expression of the HIS3 reporter. We regarded this viability rate as reflecting the strength of the telomere binding activity of each deletion derivative. DNA Bending Assay—We generated three probes of the same size but containing telomere repeats in different locations by PCR using pGEM-TE with (TTAGGC)6 repeats as a template and the following γ-32P end-labeled primers: Tel L1 (5′-GCCGCGGGAATTCGAT-3′), Tel L2 (5′-TGCTTCCGGCTCGTATG-3′), Tel M1 (5′-GTTGTAAAACGACGGG-3′), Tel M2 (5′-TTAGGTGACACTATAGAATAC-3′) Tel R1 (5′-CTTCGCTATTACGCCAGC-3′), Tel R2 (5′-ATTCACTAGTGATTAAGC-3′). Probes were purified from 10% polyacrylamide gels. Gel shift assays with in vitro translated CEH-37 were carried out as described above. Subcellular Localization of CEH-37 in Vivo—To determine the subcellular localization of CEH-37, we substituted the full-length ceh-37 ORF with the histone 2B ORF in the plasmid pJH4.52. pJH4.52, a plasmid that contains the pie-1 regulatory region, which drives GFP expression in early embryos, was kindly provided by Geraldine Seydoux. We then microinjected the construct mixed with PstI-digested N2 genomic DNA into mut-7 (pk204) mutants to avoid the germline suppression of transformed DNA and to prolong GFP expression over several generations. The transgenic animals containing this reporter construct were observed by a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was used to visualize chromosomes. RNA Interference—Full-length mrt-2 cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR and inserted into pPD 129.36. single-stranded RNAs were generated with the RiboMax in vitro transcription kit (T7, Promega). After phenol: chloroform treatment and EtOH precipitation, single-stranded RNA products were denatured at 70 °C for 10 min and allowed to anneal by cooling to room temperature. 100–200 μg/ml double-stranded RNA was injected into wild-type or mutant L4 stage animals. Identification of CEH-37 as the Nematode Telomere-binding Protein—We first cloned C. elegans telomeric repeat sequences by amplifying genomic DNA with telomere sequences as primers. We obtained clones containing 6, 26, 60, and 120 repeats of the sequence TTAGGC. We constructed a bait plasmid that contains 26 telomere repeats and screened 3.6 × 106 yeast colonies after transformation of a prey library. We identified two positive clones from this screen, which had an identical 1.3-kb cDNA insert that encodes a previously predicted protein gene ceh-37. ceh-37 had been identified by its sequence homology to homeobox proteins (16Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Finn R.D. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The CEH-37 protein had highest homology to the cone rod homeobox protein (CRX) and the OTX2 protein (Fig. 1, A and B). However, the homology between CEH-37 and these homeobox proteins did not extend outside the homeobox region. Specifically, although 42 of the 60 amino acid residues of the homeodomain in CEH-37 are identical to those of CRX, the glutamine-rich domain, the basic domain, and the tail domain, all of which are conserved in OTX family proteins, are not conserved in CEH-37. Furthermore, sequences conserved among OTX proteins, SIWSPASESP, SYFSG, LSPM, and LDYKDQ, are not conserved in CEH-37. This discrepancy in the primary structures of CEH-37 and other OTX proteins indicates that the functions of the remaining region of CEH-37 differ from those of the OTX proteins. Comparison of CEH-37 with known telomere-binding proteins TRF1, TRF2, and Taz1p showed no apparent homology from the standpoint of amino acid sequences. Although the known telomere-binding proteins have an N-terminal dimerization domain consisting of nine α helices (17Fairall L. Chapman L. Moss H. de Lange T. Rhodes D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), CEH-37 apparently lacks this typical dimerization domain. Furthermore, the TRF proteins have a Myb domain at their C-terminal region as the DNA binding domain, whereas CEH-37 has a homeodomain in its N-terminal region. Since CEH-37 shares sequence similarity with homeodomain proteins, which are generally transcription factors, whereas most identified double-stranded telomere-binding proteins contain Myb domains, we wished to compare the three-dimensional structure of CEH-37 with that of other telomere-binding proteins. Because both domains are composed of a helix-turn-helix structure, it is conceivable that the homeodomain of CEH-37 would be structurally similar to the Myb domain. We utilized the SWISS MODEL software (www.expasy.org/swiss mod) to model the CEH-37 homeodomain. We were unable to use the solved TRF1 Myb domain structure as a template because there is little primary amino acid sequence similarity between TRF1 and CEH-37. Instead, we used the Engrailed homeodomain structure since it contains a homeodomain similar to that of CEH-37. For structural comparison, we fitted the solved three-dimensional structure of the Myb domain of TRF1 to the three-dimensional model of the homeodomain of CEH-37 using the SPDBV software (www.expasy.org/swissmod). We found that the two proteins have very similar tertiary structures (Fig. 1C). We also found that the modeled three-dimensional structure of the S. pombe Taz1 protein, a TRF ortholog (9Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), is similar to that of the TRF1 Myb domain and the CEH-37 homeodomain except that it lacks the third helix. We found little, if any, similarity between the CEH-37 structure and that of RAP-1, a telomere-associated protein identified in S. cerevisiae and humans (data not shown). Consistent with this, it was recently reported that the NMR structure of hTRF1 bound to DNA is different from that of Rap1p bound to DNA (18Nishikawa T. Okamura H. Nagadoi A. Konig P. Rhodes D. Nishimura Y. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1237-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The structural similarity between CEH-37 and hTRF1 implies that the nematode telomere-binding protein may represent an evolutionary adaptation in terms of tertiary protein structure rather than primary amino acid sequence. CEH-37 Specifically Binds to C. elegans Telomere Sequences in Vitro—To examine whether the CEH-37 protein specifically binds to the C. elegans telomere, we performed competition assays using the nematode, human, and rice telomere sequences as cold competitors (Fig. 2). Although the nematode cold telomere sequence was able to efficiently compete with the binding ability of CEH-37, neither the human nor the rice telomere sequence was able to compete with CEH-37 (Fig. 2A). To examine whether CEH-37 binds to other sequences than the telomere sequence of the nematode genome, we performed competition assays with the consensus CRX binding motifs. We found that the CRX binding motif sequences did not compete with the CEH-37 binding, indicating that CEH-37 probably binds only to the nematode telomere sequence (Fig. 2B). Gel retardation assays with different numbers of the telomeric repeats showed that CEH-37 binding required at least 1.5 repeats of TTAGGC, that is, TTAGGCTTA was sufficient to bind CEH-37 (Fig. 2C). We found that mutations in any single nucleotide from the 4th G through the 9th A in an oligomer of TTAGGCTTAGGC abolished CEH-37 binding ability, indicating that the GGCTTA motif forms the core of the CEH-37 binding site (Fig. 2D). CEH-36, a possible paralog of CEH-37, did not bind the telomere at all (data not shown), indicating that this closely related C. elegans homeodomain protein does not bind to telomeric sequences. To define the roles of the domains of CEH-37 in telomere binding, we examined various CEH-37 derivative proteins. By in vitro binding assays, we found that the C-term was dispensable for telomere binding because the truncated protein lacking the C-terminal region was able to bind the telomeric DNA (Fig. 3A). We also found that the N-term of the protein and the homeodomain were both necessary and sufficient for binding to telomeric DNA (Fig. 3A). Supporting this, in the yeast one-hybrid assay, only the colonies that contained N-H domains, but not N-term, C-term, or H-C domains, survived in media lacking histidine at a rate comparable with that of colonies containing the full-length CEH-37 (Table I). From these in vitro and in vivo domain study results, we suggest that the homeodomain is directly involved in contacting DNA and that the N-term domain may be involved in dimerization of the protein units. Consistent with this, the N-term domain competitor efficiently inhibited the binding of CEH-37 to telomeric sequences, indicating that the N-term domain acts in a dominant negative manner (Fig. 3B). However, we cannot rule out other possible reasons for the competition by the N-term domain because the competition assay was not a direct evidence of dimerization. The idea that the N-term of CEH-37 may be required for dimerization parallels known telomere-binding proteins despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology.Table IYeast one-hybrid assay with derivatives of CEH-37 for telomere binding in vivoNumber of colonies on non-selective mediumNumber of colonies on selective mediumViability%Full-length2401178574.3N term + homeodomain4255315074.0Homeodomain alone354000.0Homeodomain + C-term581500.0N-term + C-term327600.0 Open table in a new tab CEH-37 Bends DNA by Binding to Telomeric DNA in Vitro—A telomere-binding protein, TRF1, but not TRF2, is known to bind and bend telomere sequences (19Bianchi A. Smith S. Chong L. Elias P. de Lange T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This bending may be important for forming loop structures at the telomeric ends. We thus examined whether CEH-37 could bend DNA. Three probes were used in this assay: a 200-bp probe with six telomere sequence repeats at the left end (indicated as L in Fig. 4A); a probe identical to the left side except for an internal telomere sequence (indicated as M in Fig. 4A); and a third probe containing a telomere sequence at the right end (indicated as R in Fig. 4A). The mobility of the CEH-37-M complex is slower than that of the CEH-37-L or CEH-37-R complexes (Fig. 4B, left panel). This result clearly shows that CEH-37 bends the DNA when bound to telomere DNA sequences. Interestingly, the CEH-37 protein lacking the C-terminal domain could not bend DNA despite its ability to bind telomeric DNA (Fig. 4B, right panel), indicating that the C domain is important for the proper function of CEH-37. The fact that CEH-37 can bend telomere repeat-containing DNA raises the possibility that CEH-37 may have roles in establishing or maintaining a secondary structure of telomeres in vivo. CEH-37 Is Mainly Localized to Telomeres in Vivo—To determine the subcellular localization of the CEH-37 protein, we monitored fluorescence signals produced by a fusion of CEH-37 to a GFP reporter protein. For this experiment, we used the pie-1 promoter to express the CEH-37 fusion protein so that we could visualize embryonic chromosomes (20Mello C.C. Draper B.W. Krause M. Weintraub H. Priess J.R. Cell. 1992; 70: 163-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We introduced the reporter gene into the mut-7 background, in which the germline suppression of transgenes is not maintained (21Ketting R.F. Plasterk R.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 296-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We observed that the CEH-37 GFP fluorescence was primarily co-localized to the ends of the chromosomes at least in the metaphase (Fig. 5). From these results, we propose that CEH-37 binds telomeric DNA both in vitro and in vivo. ceh-37, Together with mrt-2, Is Required for Chromosome Stability—To define the biological functions of CEH-37, we examined the phenotypes of a deletion mutant that lacks the C-terminal region, which was shown to be essential for DNA bending (Table II). This deletion mutant may represent a reduction-of-function mutation in ceh-37 since CEH-37 lacking the C domain did not bend telomeric DNA, which might be crucial for its function. Mutant animals showed low, but significant, embryonic lethality (0.01 < p < 0.025). We then examined whether the deletion mutant produced more males. A high incidence of males is a typical indicator of chromosome instability since the males can arise by abnormal chromosome segregation. The mutant animals indeed produced more males than wild-type animals (0.05 < p < 0.1).Table IIGenetic interaction of ceh-37 with mrt-2Genetic backgroundRNAiaRNA interference.TotalDead eggsbMean ± S.E.MalesbMean ± S.E.n%%Wild typeTE32010.19 ± 0.040.12 ± 0.04ceh-37(ok272)TE30513.47 ± 1.020.72 ± 0.17Wild typemrt-226151.04 ± 0.320.23 ± 0.05ceh-37(ok272)mrt-227164.77 ± 1.671.42 ± 0.14a RNA interference.b Mean ± S.E. Open table in a new tab We then examined the genetic relationships between ceh-37 and mrt-2, which may function at C. elegans telomeres, by the RNA interference technique. mrt-2 was originally identified by a mutation conferring sterility due to telomeric instability (22Ahmed S. Hodgkin J. Nature. 2000; 403: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); the wild-type allele was found to encode the telomeric checkpoint protein. We found that the frequency of males in the ceh-37 deletion mutants subjected to mrt-2 RNA interference was significantly larger than the simple sum of the frequency of the males in the ceh-37 mutant alone and the wild-type animals subjected to mrt-2 RNA interference (p < 0.005), indicating that ceh-37 may interact synergistically with mrt-2 with respect to telomeric functions (Table II). In this report, we identified a novel homeodomain-containing protein, CEH-37, as a telomere-binding protein in the nematode C. elegans. Although the closest mammalian homolog of CEH-37 is CRX, a transcription factor that acts in photoreceptors, our results strongly suggest that CEH-37 has different functions. First, the CEH-37 primary structure diverges extensively outside the conserved homeodomain, indicating that although the homeodomain is a DNA binding domain, the remainder of the protein may have functions distinct from those of CRX proteins. Second, three-dimensional modeling of the CEH-37 homeodomain shows that it is structurally almost identical to that of TRF1, although there is no sequence homology between CEH-37 and TRF1. Third, the consensus recognition sequence for the CRX proteins cannot compete with the nematode telomere sequences in CEH-37 binding. Lastly, CEH-37 is primarily localized to the telomeres in vivo. Although CEH-37 shows no similarity to known telomere-binding proteins in terms of amino acid sequence, it shares several features with other telomere-binding proteins. Functionally, CEH-37 binds telomere DNA in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that CEH-37 may bind telomeres as dimers and that the dimerization domain may be in its N-terminal region, as other TRF proteins do. The roles of the domains within CEH-37 were suggested by our analyses: the N-term for dimerization, the homeodomain for DNA binding, and the C-term for DNA bending. Further studies would be necessary to directly prove the suggested roles of each domain, such as two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and the examination of the sufficiency of the C-term domain to bend DNA in other contexts. CEH-37 can bend DNA, as some telomere-binding proteins such as TRF1 and Rap1 do. The biochemical properties of CEH-37 as reported in this study indicate that CEH-37 may play roles at the telomeres in vivo. Most telomere-binding proteins identified so far rely upon a Myb domain for binding activity, but C. elegans utilizes a different motif, the homeodomain for CEH-37. An extensive data base search for homologs of the human TRF1, TRF2, and Rap1 proteins and of S. pombe Taz1p failed to uncover such a protein in the nematode. 2S. H. Kim, S. B. Hwang, I. K. Chung, and J. Lee, unpublished observation. The absence of TRF homologs and the presence of a homeobox-containing telomere-binding protein raises the possibility that telomere-binding proteins may have independently evolved in the nematode. The nematode telomere DNA repeats have a sequence content that differs from that of other organisms. The mammalian telomere DNA repeat motif is TTAGGG, the plant motif is TTTAGGG, and the yeast sequence is altogether different. In the evolution of telomere sequences, the properties of telomere-binding proteins may have undergone changes as well. There are a few possible explanations as to why we identified a different type of protein from Myb domain-containing protein as a telomere-binding protein. One is that the nematode independently evolved the telomere-binding protein, but the structural limitations imposed by telomeres restricted the range of functional proteins to those with helix-loop-helix binding domains. A solution of the three-dimensional structure of CEH-37 bound to the telomere sequences may be relevant to this idea. A second possibility is that there may be as yet unidentified homeodomain telomere-binding proteins in other organisms. Homeodomain proteins have long been implicated in developmental programming, but there are many homeodomain-containing proteins in the human genome data base whose functions are not well established, and it would be interesting to examine whether any of these proteins binds human telomeres. On the other hand, because we used only one cDNA library in screening for the proteins binding to the telomere repeats, it is unlikely that our screen was saturated. It is conceivable that there are other proteins awaiting identification that specifically bind the nematode telomere DNA. It is of interest to identify more telomere-binding proteins and their functions. The mechanisms by which telomere-binding proteins act may have undergone evolutionary diversification as well. For example, yeast RAP1p directly binds telomere sequences, whereas the human RAP1 homolog is recruited by TRF2 (23Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The CEH-37 action may provide another example. The Myb-like domains of some telomere-binding proteins can bind alone to telomeres, but the CEH-37 homeodomain (without the N-terminal domain) cannot. This observation suggests that Myb domain-containing proteins and the homeodomain proteins may differ with respect to how they bind telomeres. The Myb domain of the rice telomere-binding protein binds the telomere, and proteins containing this domain bind as dimers (11Yu E.Y. Kim S.E. Kim J.H. Ko J.H. Cho M.H. Chung I.K. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), indicating that this protein may first bind telomeres and then dimerize, whereas CEH-37 may dimerize before telomere binding. The functions of the single-stranded telomere-binding proteins have been conserved in evolution despite their apparent lack of high sequence homology. Pot1 was identified in S. pombe and in humans as a distant relative of the ciliate TEBPa protein (24Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of Cdc13 was shown to be similar to that of TEBPa (14Mitton-Fry R.M. Anderson E.M. Hughes T.R. Lundblad V. Wuttke D.S. Science. 2002; 296: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). An emerging consensus is that single-stranded telomere-binding proteins may have different primary structures but that they have common structures, such as the OB fold, and common functions, such as telomere capping (25de Lange T. Science. 2001; 292: 1075-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This may also be true for double-stranded telomere-binding proteins. Mammalian TRF proteins and C. elegans CEH-37 have unrelated primary structures, but their tertiary structures and functions may be conserved. It has been shown that a long stretch of mammalian double-stranded telomere DNA bends back on itself to form a large loop (t-loop) and that the 3′ G-rich single-stranded overhang at the end of the t-loop invades an internal double-stranded telomeric region, producing a displacement loop (d-loop) (26Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 27Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). These loops are proposed to mask telomere termini from cellular activities that can act on DNA ends. TRF2 has been shown to be critical in both loop formation and stabilization. In Oxytricha, Trypanosoma, and budding yeast, telomeres are reported to form loops (28Murti K.G. Prescott D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14436-14439Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Munoz-Jordan J.L. Cross G.A. Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 30de Bruin D. Zaman Z. Liberatore R.A. Ptashne M. Nature. 2001; 409: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet established whether these loops confer functional telomere protection. Instead, it appears that loops are limited to Oxytricha and Trypanosoma minichromosomes and that the telomeric loops in budding yeast are involved in the regulation of gene expression rather than telomere protection. Furthermore, the formation of telomeric loops has not been well established for other model species such as S. pombe and the nematode C. elegans. Our preliminary data showed that a minority of genomic DNA hybridized with telomere probe showed reduced mobility on a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (data not shown), raising the possibility that the nematode telomeres may indeed form loops. It would be interesting to examine whether the nematode telomeres contain loops by more direct methods such as electron microscopy. One critical question that awaits clearer answer is what the physiological functions of ceh-37 are in vivo. Our data suggest that ceh-37 may play important roles at the telomeres such as maintenance of chromosome stability. However, the deletion mutation that we examined in this study did not cause visible telomere-related phenotypes such as shortened telomere length or shortened life span (data not shown). One possibility is that the mutation we examined was a deletion mutation expected to result in a truncated protein with the N-term and the homeodomain intact, indicating that this mutation may not be a null mutation. It would be interesting to identify and examine a complete null mutation of ceh-37. There is another possibility in difficulties in interpreting the genetic data: the presence of redundancy among telomere-binding proteins. It would be important to identify other telomere-binding protein genes in C. elegans and examine their functions in conjunction with ceh-37. On the other hand, one cannot rule out the possibility that CEH-37 may have functions other than telomere binding in vivo. One example of the multifunctional telomere-binding protein is RAP1p. RAP1p in yeast was originally identified as a protein that binds both silencer and activator sequences (31Shore D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 51: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), and later, it was reported to bind telomeres (13Conrad M.N. Wright J.H. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Thus RAP1p in yeast is a multifunctional protein both in gene regulation and in telomere function. We found that CEH-37 was primarily co-localized to the ends of chromosomes, but we also noticed very faint fluorescence throughout the chromosomes, raising the possibility that this faint GFP signal might represent a biologically meaningful function of ceh-37. We thank Drs. R. Barstead for the cDNA library, A. Coulson for the cosmid, A. Fire, and G. Seydoux for the vectors. We also thank the C. elegans knockout consortium at Oklahoma for the ceh-37 deletion mutant strain, and the C. elegans Genetics Center (Minneapolis, MN) for other strains."

Here we describe the crystal structures of (a) the complex between a naturally mutated proteinaceous antigen and an antibody that was mutated and selected in vitro, and (b) the complex between the normal antigen and the mutated antibody. The mutated and selected antibody recognizes essentially the same epitope as in the wild-type antibody, indicating successful target site-directed functional alteration of the antibody. In comparing the structure of the mutated antigen-mutant antibody complex with the previously established structure of the wild-type antigen-wild-type antibody complex, we found that the enhanced affinity of the mutated antibody for the mutant antigen originated not from improvements in local complementarity around the mutated sites but from subtle and critical structural changes in nonmutated sites, including an increase in variable domain interactions. Our findings indicate that only a few mutations in the antigen-binding region of an antibody can lead to some structural changes in its paratopes, emphasizing the critical roles of the plasticity of loops in the complementarity-determining region and also the importance of the plasticity of the interaction between the variable regions of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains in determining the specificity of an antibody.

Often only a few mutations in the epitope of an antigen enable it to evade immunological attack. Major examples occur in viral coat proteins, e.g. hemagglutinin of influenza virus, gp120 of the human immunodeficiency virus, and human hepatitis B virus surface antigen (1Poignard P. Saphire E.O. Parren P.W. Burton D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 253-274Google Scholar, 2Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Google Scholar, 3Klenerman P. Wu Y. Phillips R. Curr. Opin.

Despite only a few mutations in the antigenic epitope, the specificity and affinity of neutralizing antibodies for the mutated antigen can be completely abolished. The ability to generate specific antibodies directed against the mutated antigenic epitope thus should prove very useful. However, site-directed random mutation, chain shuffling, and DNA shuffling methods have led to only limited success in improving the affinity of antibodies for target antigens (6Saviranta P.

Thus, structural alterations arising from changes in the antigen and/or interfacial antibody residues reduce antigen-antibody affinity. Several studies of structural changes involved in the ability of influenza virus to evade the immune system have shown that minimal structural changes in the antigen are enough to prevent antibody binding (17Fleury D. Wharton S.A. Skehel J.J. Knossow M. Bizebard T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 119-123Google Scholar, 18Fleury D. Barrère B. Bizebard T. Daniels R.S. Skehel J.J. Knossow M. Nat. Struct.

Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Google Scholar). Recent advances in antibody engineering have made it possible to prepare tailor-made antibody fragments by in vitro selection (21Winter G.

Biol. 2000; 296: 57-86Google Scholar). In particular, enhancement of the affinity of humanized mouse antibodies and of human antibodies selected from naive phage display libraries without alteration of target sites offers scope for the development of functional and useful antibody molecules (25Huston J.S. George A.J. Hum. Antib. 2001; 10: 127-142Google Scholar, 26Rader C. Cheresh D.A. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8910-8915Google Scholar, 27Baca M. Presta L.G. O'Connor S.J. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10678-10684Google Scholar). Based on hundreds of studies of antibody structures, precise procedures for modeling these proteins have been developed. Therefore, a combination of structural information and in vitro selection, e.g. by phage display technology, should be a realistic and reasonable way to achieve epitope-directed improvements in antibody-antigen recognition. Recently, we reported the selection and functional characterization of an anti-hen egg white lysozyme antibody (HyHEL-10) from a focus library of antibody variable domains (i.e. mini-libraries containing random mutations at four identical sites in the complementarity determining region (CDR) 1The abbreviations used are: CDR, complementarity-determining region; HEL, hen egg white lysozyme; TEL, turkey egg white lysozyme; VH, variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain; VL, variable region of immunoglobulin light chain; Fv, variable-region fragment of immunoglobulin; WT, wild-type; SFSF mutant, mutant HyHEL-10 Fv in which Tyr53–Ser54–Ser56–Tyr58 in the VH chain is replaced with Ser53–Phe54–Ser56–Phe58. 2 of the heavy chain (CDR-H2) region). Phage display was used to enhance its specificity toward turkey lysozyme (a naturally mutated antigen) (28Nishimiya Y. Tsumoto K. Shiroishi M. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12813-12820Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetric studies have revealed the following (28Nishimiya Y. Tsumoto K. Shiroishi M. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12813-12820Google Scholar). 1) Mutants selected have an affinity toward turkey lysozyme with an order of 108 and a reduced affinity toward the original antigen, hen lysozyme, with an order of 106–7. 2) Increase in negative enthalpy change (–ΔH) has driven the enhancement of an affinity for the target antigen, whereas decrease in –ΔH led to reduction of the affinity for hen lysozyme. Structural information of the complexes would give several insights into the molecular mechanism for target site-directed functional alteration of antibodies. Here we report structural analyses of complexes between the naturally mutated antigen and an artificially mutated and selected antibody and between the normal antigen and the same antibody. On the basis of the results obtained, we discuss the critical effects on antibody specificity of the plasticity of the CDR loops (including the roles of some antibody residues that support the loop structures) and also of the plasticity of the interaction between the variable regions of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. Materials—Hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) was obtained from Seikagaku-Kogyo Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) and turkey egg white lysozyme (TEL) from Sigma. The expression vector for the HyHEL-10 variable region fragment (Fv) (wild-type and an SFSF mutant in which sites 53, 54, 56, and 58 are Ser, Phe, Ser, and Phe, respectively) was described previously (28Nishimiya Y. Tsumoto K. Shiroishi M. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12813-12820Google Scholar). All other reagents were of biochemical research grade. Expression and Purification of Soluble Fv Fragments—A transformed Escherichia coli strain, BL21 (DE3) (29Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar), harboring an expression vector was grown at 28 °Cin2× YT (30Sambrook J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 200 μg ml–1 ampicillin, until the early stationary phase. To induce the expression of the soluble Fv fragment, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the culture was grown overnight at 28 °C. The bacterial supernatant and periplasmic fractions were separated from 200 ml of the culture as follows (31Tsumoto K. Ueda Y. Maenaka K. Watanabe K. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28777-28782Google Scholar). The culture sample was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C; the culture supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m sucrose, and 0.1 mm EDTA and was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then 40 ml of water was added to give an osmotic shock, and the cells were left on ice for 30 min. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved as the periplasmic sample. The supernatant and periplasmic samples were salted out with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation, and the precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein precipitates were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and were dialyzed against the same buffer for 2 days at 4 °C. The precipitates that formed during dialysis were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a TEL-Sepharose column, in which about 10 mg of TEL per milliliter of gel was bound to CNBractivated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Bioscience) previously equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. The column (inner diameter, 10 mm × 5 cm) was washed with 100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.5) containing 500 mm NaCl; the adsorbed protein was then eluted with 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 2.0). The eluate was quickly neutralized with 1 m Tris·HCl (pH 7.5). The Fv fragment obtained by affinity chromatography was further purified on a Superdex 75pg column (inner diameter, 10 mm × 100 cm), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) containing 200 mm NaCl, and finally dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Although the complex of the HyHEL-10 SFSF Fv fragment with HEL was crystallized as described previously (32Kondo H. Shiroishi M. Matsushima M. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27623-27631Google Scholar), the crystal of the SFSF·HEL complex most suitable for further analyses could be grown from 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.6–7.8), 10% w/v polyethylene glycol 8000, 10% ethylene glycerol. The crystal of the SFSF·TEL complex suitable for further analyses was grown from 200 mm ammonium acetate, 100 mm tri-sodium citrate dihydrate buffer (pH 6.6), 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, 10% ethylene glycerol. They were elongated, bipyramidshaped crystals. All crystallographic data were collected at 100 K by using synchrotron radiation on beam line 6A of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) with a Weissenberg camera (33Sakabe N. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. 1991; 303: 448-463Google Scholar). The diffraction images were integrated with the hkl program DENZO, and the intensity data were processed with SCALA and AGROVATA in the CCP4 suite (34Collaborative Computational Project No 4 Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab The crystal of SFSF Fv complex with HEL was isomorphous with crystals of the wild-type (WT) Fv complex with HEL (32Kondo H. Shiroishi M. Matsushima M. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27623-27631Google Scholar), whereas the crystal of SFSF Fv complex with TEL was grown in the different crystal form. The model coordinates of the SFSF complexes were derived from those of the wild-type complex structure (Protein Data Bank ID code 1c08). The structure of the SFSF·HEL complex was refined with the program CNS (35Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Although symmetry of diffraction intensities of SFSF·TEL showed Laue group of 4/mmm, the corresponding unit cell cannot contain one molecule in an asymmetric unit under the space group symmetry. Test for hemihedral twinning (36Yeates T.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 344-358Google Scholar) has shown this crystal as a perfect twinning crystal, i.e. the twin fraction was estimated as 0.5. The structures of this crystal were determined by a molecular replacement method with the program AMoRe (37Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 805-812Google Scholar) in the CCP4 suite. Refinement was carried out by program SHELX97 (38Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Google Scholar), introducing TWIN and BASF options. The atomic coordinates of the mutant Fv-lysozyme complexes were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (ID codes 1UA6 and 1UAC for HEL·SFSF and TEL·SFSF, respectively). Overall Structure of Mutant Lysozyme-HyHEL-10 Complexes—Earlier, we reported the selection and functional characterization of an anti-hen egg white lysozyme antibody (HyHEL-10) from a focus library of antibody variable domains (i.e. mini-libraries containing random mutations at four identical sites in the CDR-H2 region). Phage display was used to enhance its specificity toward turkey egg white lysozyme (28Nishimiya Y. Tsumoto K. Shiroishi M. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12813-12820Google Scholar). Several mutants were selected. Here we report structural analyses of one of them (SFSF), complexed with TEL (essentially a naturally mutated antigen) and with the wild-type antigen HEL. The contact residues in each complex are summarized in Table II.Table IIAmino acid residues participating in antigen-antibody interactionsCDRSFSF residueTEL residueHEL residueCDRSFSF residueTEL residueHEL residueL1Gly30Gly16H2Tyr50Arg21Arg21Asn31Leu15His15Ser100Ser100Gly16Gly16Ser52Asp101Lys96Lys96Ser53Arg73Asn32Gly16Gly16Leu75Leu75Tyr20Tyr20Phe54Trp62Trp62Lys96Lys96Trp63L2Tyr50Asn93Asn93Leu75Lys96Lys96Asp101Gln53Thr89Thr89Ser56Gly102Gly102Asn93Asn93Phe58Arg21Arg21L3Ser91Tyr20Tyr20Ser100Ser100Asn92Asn19Asn19Gly101Asp101Tyr20Gly102Gly102Arg21Arg21H3Trp95Lys97Lys97Trp94Arg21Ser100Ser100Tyr96Arg21Asp96Lys97Lys97H1Thr30Lys73Arg73Leu75Ser31Lys73Arg73Leu75Leu75Asp32Leu75Asn77Lys97Lys97Tyr33Trp63Trp63Lys97Lys97Ser100Ser100Gly101Asp101 Open table in a new tab Superposition of the Cα backbones of the TEL·SFSF, HEL·SFSF, and HEL·WT complexes indicated that, despite four mutations in the CDR-H2 loop of SFSF relative to WT and four mutations in TEL relative to HEL, the overall structures of the TEL·SFSF, HEL·SFSF, and HEL·WT complexes were almost identical (Fig. 1), except for some residues in the flexible loops. The crystal structure of HEL·WT indicates that the following noncovalent bonds occur in the interface between antigen and antibody: 16 hydrogen bonds, 2 salt bridges, and 98 van der Waals interactions (32Kondo H. Shiroishi M. Matsushima M. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27623-27631Google Scholar). In TEL·SFSF, 14 hydrogen bonds, 2 salt bridges, and 97 van der Waals interactions were found; and in HEL·SFSF, 16 hydrogen bonds, 2 salt bridges, and 94 van der Waals interactions were found. Differences in amino acid residues participating in the interactions were also observed (Table II). In the TEL·SFSF complex, Thr30VH, Trp62TEL, Lys73TEL, and Asn77TEL were found to be direct contact residues in the antigen-antibody interface, but Ser93VL, Tyr96VL, and Ser52VH were not. In the HEL·SFSF complex, Thr30VH, Trp62HEL, and Arg73HEL were included in the direct contact residues, but Ser93VL and Trp94VL were not. Shape Complementarities—Shape complementarities of the molecular surfaces between antibody Fv fragment and two antigen lysozymes have been estimated using program SC (15Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Google Scholar) in the CCP4 program suit. Sc values for HEL·WT, HEL·SFSF, and TEL·SFSF were 0.702, 0.729, and 0.705, respectively, suggesting that the interface of these antigen-antibody complexes have almost identical shape complementarity to each other. On the other hand, shape complementarities of the molecular surfaces between VH and VL are calculated to be 0.700, 0.733, and 0.695, for HEL·WT, HEL·SFSF, and TEL·SFSF, respectively. Interfacial Water Molecules—In the TEL·SFSF complex, five water molecules bridged the imperfect complementarity of the antigen-antibody chains, and in HEL·SFSF, seven interfacial water molecules were observed. The hydrogen bond networks (via interfacial water molecules) were almost identical in the TEL·SFSF and HEL·SFSF complexes, except for the two additional interfacial water molecules in HEL·SFSF. Local Structural Changes in Mutated CDR-H2—Superposition of the three complexes indicated that the orientation of CDR-H2 changed in the mutants (Fig. 2). A major change occurred around Phe54VH. The epitope recognized by residue 54 has a flexible structure, suggesting induced conformational changes depending on whether WT or SFSF antibody binds to it. As shown in Fig. 3a, Phe54VH of SFSF interacts with Trp63HEL, Leu75HEL, and Asp101HEL, leading to clustering of the residues in the HEL·SFSF complex. In contrast, Phe54VH of SFSF interacts only with Trp62TEL in the TEL·SFSF complex. The different orientations of Phe54VH in TEL·SFSF and in HEL·SFSF may lead to other changes in orientation of the CDR-H2 loop in the complex structure. Other local structural changes were observed around Phe58VH. In the HEL·SFSF complex, the amide groups of Arg21HEL (gray) make hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Tyr50VH (red), and the aromatic ring of Tyr58VH (red) interacts with Arg21HEL (gray) via an amino-aromatic interaction (Fig. 3, b and c). In the TEL·SFSF complex, one of the amide groups in Arg21TEL (green) makes a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr50VH (violet) and also interacts with the aromatic ring via an amino-aromatic interaction (Fig. 3, b and c). In addition, contacts between Tyr58VH and Phe50VH in TEL·SFSF are increased compared with the HEL·WT and HEL·SFSF complexes. Isothermal titration calorimetric studies have suggested an enthalpic contribution of Phe58VH in lysozyme-mutant antibody interactions (28Nishimiya Y. Tsumoto K. Shiroishi M. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12813-12820Google Scholar). Deletion of the hydroxyl group of Tyr58VH from HyHEL-10 WT may lead to reorientation of the aromatic ring of VH at site 58 toward the loop consisting of residues 99–102, which might enhance the affinity of the antibody for lysozyme. Local Structural Changes in Other CDR Loops—Even though there was no mutation in the other CDR loops of SFSF, crystallographic studies have revealed several local differences between the TEL·SFSF and HEL·SFSF complexes. CDR-L3—In TEL·SFSF, the amide side chain of Asn92VL made hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl of Asn19TEL (3.16 Å) and the side chain of Asn32VL. In HEL·SFSF, the length of the hydrogen bond between Asn92VL and Asn19HEL is 3.27 Å, and one interfacial water molecule mediates the contacts with the main chain carbonyls of Asp18HEL and Gly16HEL via hydrogen bonds. CDR-H1—In TEL·SFSF and HEL·SFSF, hydrogen bond formations between Ser31VHOγ and the main chain carbonyl of Arg73HEL (or Lys73TEL) and between the hydroxyl group of Tyr33VH and the main chain carbonyl of Lys97HEL (or TEL) were observed. In addition, the side chain carboxyl group of Asp32VH made a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn77TEL in TEL·SFSF. Asn77TEL participated in a hydrogen bond network via an interfacial water molecule located in the interface between TEL·SFSF and CDR-H3 (Fig. 4), which was not observed in the HEL·SFSF and HEL·WT complexes. CDR-H3—No major conformational changes occurred between the three complexes. The contact area of TEL·VL in the TEL·SFSF complex, however, increased. Additionally, a hydrogen bond network in TEL·SFSF via an interfacial water molecule, distinct from that in HEL·SFSF, was observed (Fig. 4), suggesting that the interfacial water molecules control the complementarity of the antigen-binding site of the antibody, as was suggested for anti-steroid hormone antibody 4155 (40Trinh C.H. Hemmingtoon S.D. Verhoeyen M.E. Phillips S.E. Structure. 1997; 5: 937-948Google Scholar) and other antigen-antibody and protein-ligand interactions (41Ladbury J.E. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 973-980Google Scholar, 42Ysern X. Li H. Mariuzza R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 412-414Google Scholar, 43Bhat T.N. Bentley G.A. Boulot G. Greene M.I. Tello D. Dall'Acqua W. Souchon H. Schwarz F.P. Mariuzza R.A. Poljak R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1089-1093Google Scholar). CDR-CDR and VH-VL Interactions—Although the contact area of the SFSF antibody participating in binding the TEL (∼819 Å2) was almost the same as in the HEL·SFSF complex (∼817 Å2), the relative ratio of each CDR loop to the total areas of the antibody molecule covered by the antigen changed (Fig. 5). The ratio of CDR-H2 is reduced due to significant decreases in contact area at residue 54VH in SFSF (Fig. 3). However, some changes in the local structures of CDR-L2, -L3, and -H1 via hydrogen bond formation and removal of interfacial water molecules lead to different ratios of areas covered by each CDR loop in the WT·HEL complex. The contact area between VL and VH in TEL·SFSF increased by 50 and 148 Å2 relative to the HEL·SFSF (1528 Å2) and HEL·WT (1430 Å2) complexes, respectively, mainly because of an increase in the contact of CDR-H3 with the VL chain (Fig. 6). These results suggest that an increase in the VL-VH contact area may drive the target site-oriented functional alteration of the antibody. In the HEL·SFSF complex, the side chain amide group of Arg71VH makes hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl of Ser53VH and also with the main chain carbonyls of Ile29VH and Asp32VH via one water molecule (W78, Fig. 7A). Similarly, in the HEL·WT complex, the NH2 of Arg71VH makes hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl of Asp32VH via one water molecule. In addition, in both these complexes, the side chain Oδ2 makes hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Asn94VH, whose side chain supports the loop structure of CDR-H3 via hydrogen bonding with the main chain amides of Gly100VH, Asp101VH, and Tyr102VH (Fig. 7B). These observations clearly indicate that the loop structures of the VH CDRs interact with each other via hydrogen bond networks. On the other hand, although a hydrogen bond network of Asn94–Gly100–Asp101–Tyr102 was observed in the TEL·SFSF complex (Fig. 7B), the main chain carbonyl of Asp32VH makes a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Trp34VH, and no hydrogen bonds of Arg71VH with the CDR loops via water molecules exist (Fig. 7A). In addition, the side chain of Asp32VH makes a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn77TEL (Fig. 4), leading to breakage of the hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn97VH. These results indicate that interaction of CDR-H1 with CDR-H3 in TEL·SFSF is weakened by mutations in CDR-H2, which might lead to stronger interaction of CDR-H3 with the VL chain in TEL·SFSF than in HEL·SFSF or HEL·WT. The hydrogen bond networks occurring via interfacial water molecules differ between TEL·SFSF and the HEL complexes and may be due to the structural changes in CDR-H1 and CDR-H3. Here we report the crystal structure of two antigen-antibody complexes. One is a complex between a mutant antibody fragment and its target antigen (the mutant antibody was selected from focus libraries containing random mutations at four sites via phage display using TEL as a natural mutant for the HEL antigen). The other is a complex between the same mutant antibody fragment and the original (HEL) antigen. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the structures of complexes of engineered antibody fragments with their target (mutated) and wild-type antigens. Introduction of amino acids rarely found in immune proteins into the antibody loops often causes structural disruption of other parts of the antibody molecule. The results reported here emphasize the critical role of the CDR loops, via subtle but critical structural rearrangements of the antibody loops because of mutations in several sites of a different loop, and also the importance of the plasticity of the VL-VH interaction in antibody specificity. We should emphasize that only four mutations in CDR-H2 result in subtle but significant structural changes in other CDR loops. The significant contribution of VL-VH interactions to the specificity and affinity of antibody molecules was first pointed out by Colman (interface adaptor hypothesis) (44Colman P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1988; 43: 99-132Google Scholar) and was experimentally demonstrated by Stanfield et al. (45Stanfield R.S. Takimoto-Kamimura M. Rini J.M. Profy A.T. Wilson I.A. Structure. 1993; 1: 83-93Google Scholar) using uncomplexed and ligand-complexed forms of anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 peptide antibody (Fab 50.1). The antibody fragment has a smaller VL-VH contact area, perhaps because of the shorter length of CDR-H3, which may lead to changes in VL-VH contact upon complexation, i.e. induced fitting upon complexation. Light chain shuffling of an antibody molecule resulted in drifts in epitope recognition, supporting the importance of cooperativity between variable regions to the high affinity of antibodies (46Ohlin M. Owman H. Mach M. Borrebaeck C.A. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 47-56Google Scholar). Recently, limited antibody pairings of domains have been proposed (47de Wildt R.M. Hoet R.M. van Venrooij W.J. Tomlinson I.M. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 895-901Google Scholar), and utilization of VL-VH interactions for immunoassay has been reported (48Ueda H. Tsumoto K. Kubota K. Suzuki E. Nagamune T. Nishimura H. Schueler P.A. Winter G. Kumagai I. Mahoney W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1714-1718Google Scholar). Interestingly, the VL-VH contact area of anti-phosphocholine antibody (McPC603) is ∼1700 Å2, despite the smaller area of contact between the antibody and the antigen (∼290 Å2), than the case of protein antigen-antibody interaction (49Satow Y. Cohen G.H. Padlan E.A. Davies D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 593-604Google Scholar). Therefore, one may conclude that an increase in affinity of our mutant antibody for a mutant target antigen is due not so much to improvements in complementarity around the mutated CDR-H2 loop as to subtle structural rearrangements of antigen, VL, and VH, which might lead to an increase in covered areas of CDR-L2, -L3, and -H1 upon complexation. We can conclude that these structural rearrangements increase the covered areas of VL-VH interfaces, resulting in an enhancement of the affinity of the mutant antibody fragment for the mutated antigen. The significant increase in interfacial areas of VL-VH interfaces in CDR-H3 should be emphasized, because antibodies that are highly diverse in CDR-H3 are created via genetic recombination in vivo (50Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Google Scholar, 51Shirai H. Nakajima N. Higo J. Kidera A. Nakamura H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 481-496Google Scholar). Complementarity of VH-VL in the SFSF·TEL complex is less than in SFSF·HEL. However, the covered area of VH-VL interface of SFSF·TEL upon complexation is larger than SFSF·HEL, and SFSF has more than 5-fold greater affinity for TEL than for HEL (28Nishimiya Y. Tsumoto K. Shiroishi M. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12813-12820Google Scholar). This suggests that an increase in complementary association of VH with VL does not always lead to the enhancement of the affinity of antibodies. Cooperativity between variable regions upon complexation might not lead to improvement of interfacial complementarities, despite grafting high affinity of antibodies for the targets. The structural analyses of three antigen-antibody complexes also highlight the critical role of residue 71 of VH in the tolerance of structural changes in CDR-H2 during induced fitting. A critical role of Arg71VH in the packing of CDR-H1 and -H2 and in the orientation of CDR-H2 has been pointed out (52Tramontano A. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 215: 175-182Google Scholar), and its role has been emphasized in reports of the structural consequences of humanizing mouse antibody molecules (53Holmes M.A. Foote J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2192-2201Google Scholar, 54Holmes M.A. Buss T.N. Foote J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 479-485Google Scholar). A series of structural changes in CDR loops may originate from distinct packing of the CDR structures in response to the orientation of the side chain of Arg71VH. Studies of hundreds of structures of antibody-antigen complexes have indicated that amino acid residues in CDRs participate in direct recognition of target antigens (10Webster D.M. Henry A.H. Rees A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 123-129Google Scholar, 11Davies D.R. Cohen G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7-12Google Scholar, 12Braden B.C. Poljak R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 9-16Google Scholar, 13Padlan E.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 49: 57-133Google Scholar, 14Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Google Scholar), suggesting that improvements in local complementarity may enhance the affinity of an antibody for its natural or mutated antigen. The results reported here, however, highlight the critical contribution to the function of antibody molecules of subtle but significant conformational changes in the antibody molecule due to mutations that affect, for example, the orientation and cooperative locations of CDR loops and VL-VH interactions. It may be significant that replacements of amino acids during affinity maturation in the immune system often occur in the framework region rather than in the CDR loops (55Diaz M. Casali P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 235-240Google Scholar, 56Papavasiliou F.N. Schatz D.G. Cell. 2002; 109: S35-S44Google Scholar, 57Cumbers S.J. Williams G.T. Davies S.L. Grenfell R.L. Takeda S. Batista F.D. Sale J.E. Neuberger M.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1129-1134Google Scholar). For improvement of the affinity of an antibody for its target antigen, not only directly contacting regions but also other regions changed by mutations, including framework regions, will be especially important. For example, some CDRs tolerate the inclusion of naturally rare amino acids via structural rearrangement of the loop structures, again emphasizing that a focus library containing mutation in specificity-determining regions (58Padlan E.A. Abergel C. Tipper J.P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 133-139Google Scholar) or hotspot residues (59Hoogenboom H.R. Chames P. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 371-378Google Scholar) can be efficiently utilized for target site-oriented functional alteration of antibody molecules. Finally, we should point out the relative insensitivity of the antibody structure to the introduction of amino acids rarely used in the immune system into an antigen. The target site-directed functional alteration of antibody molecules via focus libraries containing random mutations at several sites should be promising for researchers in various fields. Our results should encourage researchers, especially in the fields of evolutionary engineering, antibody engineering, and rational protein design. Additional accumulation of structural data on interactions between engineered proteins, including antibody molecules, is especially important. We thank Drs. N. Sakabe, M. Suzuki, N. Igarashi, and N.

To examine this issue, we developed an expression and purification strategy to isolate homogeneous populations of heterodimeric smooth muscle heavy meromyosins containing heads with different properties. As an extreme example, we characterized a heterodimer containing one native head and one head locked in a “weak binding” state by a point mutation in switch 2 (E470A). The in vitro actin filament motility of this heterodimer was the same as the homodimeric control with two cycling heads, suggesting that only one head of a pair actively interacts with actin to generate maximal velocity. A second naturally occurring heterodimer contained two cycling heads with 2-fold different activity, due to the presence or absence of a 7-amino acid insert near the active site. Enzymatically this (+/–) insert heterodimer was indistinguishable from a (50:50) mixture of the two homodimers, but its motility averaged 17% less than that of the mixture. These data suggest that one head of a heterodimer can disproportionately affect the mechanics of double-headed myosin, a finding relevant to our understanding of heterozygous mutant myosins found in disease states like familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

There has been speculation for many years about whether myosin derives any advantage from having two cross-bridge heads. The double-headed structure is clearly not necessary for actin binding or enzymatic activity, because it has long been known that proteolytically derived, single-headed subfragment 1 (S1) 1The abbreviations used are: S1, subfragment 1; HMM, heavy meromyosin; FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin, FLAG, epitope tag with amino acid sequence DYKDDDDK; His, epitope tag with amino acid sequence HHHHHH; +insert, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain containing the 7-amino acid insert in loop 1; –insert, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain lacking the 7-amino acid insert in loop 1; WT HMM, wild type homodimeric heavy meromyosin; E470A HMM, E470A homodimeric heavy meromyosin; +insert/–insert HMM, heterodimeric heavy meromyosin with one head containing the 7-amino acid insert and the other head lacking the insert; E470A/WT HMM, heterodimeric heavy meromyosin with one wild type head and one carrying the point mutation E470A; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: S1, subfragment 1; HMM, heavy meromyosin; FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin, FLAG, epitope tag with amino acid sequence DYKDDDDK; His, epitope tag with amino acid sequence HHHHHH; +insert, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain containing the 7-amino acid insert in loop 1; –insert, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain lacking the 7-amino acid insert in loop 1; WT HMM, wild type homodimeric heavy meromyosin; E470A HMM, E470A homodimeric heavy meromyosin; +insert/–insert HMM, heterodimeric heavy meromyosin with one head containing the 7-amino acid insert and the other head lacking the insert; E470A/WT HMM, heterodimeric heavy meromyosin with one wild type head and one carrying the point mutation E470A; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. retains both of these abilities (1Margossian S. Lowey S. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, a single-headed molecule can move actin filaments in the in vitro motility assay (2Toyoshima Y.Y. Kron S.J. McNally E.M. Niebling K.R. Toyoshima C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 3Waller G.S. Ouyang G. Swafford J. Vibert P. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15348-15352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the velocities sustained by one-headed fragments in this assay are generally less than that of double-headed species from the same myosin, and recent measurements in the laser trap have indicated that the unitary step size of a single-headed myosin is only half as great as that of a double-headed molecule (4Tyska M.J. Dupuis D.E. Guilford W.H. Patlak J.B. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4402-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These observations indicate not only that two heads are more effective than one in moving actin but also that they may work together in some sort of coordinated fashion. One way to gain insight into the nature of potential head-head interactions is to study myosins containing two heads that differ functionally. If each head works independently, then the activity of such a heterodimer should be halfway between that of the faster homodimer and the slower homodimer. On the other hand, if there is an interaction between the heads, the properties of the heterodimer might be closer to that of one of the homodimeric species. To study heavy meromyosin (HMM) molecules with different heads, we developed an expression strategy that involves differential labeling of the constituent heavy chains with FLAG and His tags, co-infection in the Sf9 cell system, and sequential affinity chromatography columns to isolate homogeneous preparations. We assessed two types of smooth muscle HMM heterodimer using enzymatic and mechanical assays. The first was composed of two naturally occurring smooth muscle heavy chain isoforms that differ in vitro by a factor of two in their actin-activated ATPase activity and actin filament motility (5Kelley C.A. Takahashi M. Yu J.H. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12848-12854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Mus. Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This difference is due to the presence or absence of a 7-amino acid insert in the surface loop near the nucleotide-binding pocket (7White S. Martin A.F. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1252-C1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Babij P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1467-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which has been called loop 1 (9Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Such heterodimers almost certainly exist in nature, because the mRNAs for the +insert and –insert heavy chains are co-expressed in single smooth muscle cells (10Eddinger T.J. Meer D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C309-C316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second heterodimer contained one wild type (WT) heavy chain and a second head with a mutation in switch 2 (E470A) that prevents the formation of a salt bridge between this residue and R247 in switch 1 of the active site. This mutation slows the ATPase activity of smooth myosin by two orders of magnitude, essentially “locking” it in a weak binding configuration (11Onishi H. Morales M.F. Kojima S. Katoh K. Fujiwara K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3767-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Onishi H. Kojima S. Katoh K. Fujiwara K. Martinez H.M. Morales M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6653-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the heterodimeric E470A/WT molecule has a much greater disparity in function between the two heads. Enzymatic assays indicated that the two heads of both heterodimers function independently. However, the in vitro motility assay showed that the heterodimeric (+insert/–insert) HMM moved actin filaments 17% more slowly than a 50:50 mixture of the corresponding homodimeric HMMs. In contrast, the heterodimeric E470A/WT HMM showed motility that was not significantly different from WT HMM. These results are consistent with the notion that myosin employs only one head at a time to perform work on the actin filament and, furthermore, suggest that one head of a heterodimer can exert a disproportionate effect on mechanical properties in molecules where both heads are actively cycling. DNA Engineering and Production of Recombinant Baculoviruses— The baculoviral transfer vector pAcSG2 (BD Pharmingen) was modified for the expression of HMM heavy chains with two different epitope tags. For FLAG-tagged species, both N- and C-terminal variants were created. For C-terminal tagging, a BamHI restriction site was added 3′ to an NcoI site in the polylinker, followed by in-frame sequence coding for FLAG (DYKDDDK) and a stop codon. For an N-terminal tag, nucleotide sequence encoding an initiating ATG and the FLAG tag was ligated in a position 5′ to the NcoI site. To produce species fused to an N-terminal hexa-histidine (His) tag, an initiating ATG codon followed by six histidine codons and an NcoI site were added 5′ to a BglII site in the pAcSG2 polylinker. cDNAs encoding the HMM portion of the chicken gizzard myosin heavy chain clone (13Yanagisawa M. Hamada Y. Katsuragawa Y. Imamura M. Mikawa T. Masaki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) were ligated into these three vectors to express four different HMM heavy chains. First, a C-terminal FLAG tag was attached to a clone encoding the first 1175 amino acids of the +insert heavy chain, whereas a mutant 1168-residue HMM from which the loop 1 insert had been removed (–insert) (6Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Mus. Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was ligated into the N-terminally His-tagged vector, using the NcoI and BglII sites. Glutamic acid 470 of the 1175-residue cDNA was converted to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis, and this was then cloned into the vector that adds the C-terminal FLAG tag. Finally a wild-type (WT) +insert N-terminally His-tagged construct was also synthesized. Each construct in pAcSG2 was transfected and amplified in Sf9 cells by established methods (14O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York, New York1992: 124-149Google Scholar). To produce protein, myosin heavy chain viruses were co-infected with a recombinant virus encoding both the smooth muscle myosin essential and regulatory light chains (15Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the case of heterodimers, an N-terminally His-tagged heavy chain virus was co-infected with the appropriate C-terminally FLAG-tagged heavy chain, along with the dual light-chain virus. Preliminary trials were conducted to optimize relative viral ratios so that the expression levels of the FLAG- and His-tagged heavy chains were nearly equal. Purification of HMM Proteins—After 3 days of infection, Sf9 cells were harvested and lysed, and proteins were fractionated by two successive ammonium sulfate precipitations, 0–40% and 40–70%. For the homodimers of C-terminally FLAG-tagged +insert and E470A HMM, as well as for the two types of heterodimer, the 40–70% pellet was dialyzed overnight versus a buffer containing 90 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4 at 4 °C), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. MgATP was added to a final concentration of 4 mm, the material was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to an anti-FLAG affinity column (M2 antibody, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical). After washing, HMM was eluted using a large molar excess of FLAG peptide (0.1 mg/ml), and peak fractions were pooled. This was the end point for the preparation of FLAG-labeled homodimers. In the case of the two heterodimer preparations, NaCl was added to the FLAG eluate to give a final concentration of 300 mm, and the pH was increased to 8.0 by adding 35 mm MOPS, pH 8.55. This material was then applied to a nickel-charged poly-histidine binding column (Probond, Invitrogen). Nonspecifically bound proteins were washed away using 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm MOPS (pH 8.0 at 4 °C); then heterodimeric HMM was eluted using 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 10 mm MOPS (pH 8.0 at 4 °C). Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight versus a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4 at 4 °C), and 0.2 mm DTT. The protein was then precipitated by dialysis versus saturated ammonium sulfate, collected by centrifugation, re-suspended, and finally dialyzed into 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0 at 4 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT. The homodimeric N-terminally His-tagged –insert HMM was isolated as follows. Following ammonium sulfate fractionation as above, equimolar F-actin was added to the pelleted material, which was then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C versus a phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), containing 7% sucrose (w/v), 1 mm DTT, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The actin-bound material was sedimented, then washed with 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS (pH 8.0 at 4 °C). The HMM was then eluted into the same buffer containing 1 mm MgATP, and loaded onto a Probond column. The –insert HMM was then washed and eluted from this column as described above for the heterodimer. After purification, aliquots of the various HMM preparations were phosphorylated by the addition of the following reagents (concentrations in parentheses): CaCl2 (0.75 mm); calmodulin (7.5 μg/ml); MgATP (1.5 mm); and myosin light chain kinase (3–6 μg/ml). Except for assessments of ADP release rates, all assays were conducted exclusively on phosphorylated proteins. Probes Used in Western Blots—Two 3–8% acrylamide gradient, Tris acetate-buffered NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) were loaded and run with identical samples from different steps of the heterodimer preparation then transferred to nitrocellulose. One filter was reacted with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody diluted to 0.025 μg/ml. The filter was then reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:3000. To probe for the proteins labeled with the His tag, the duplicate filter was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated His-chelating group at a dilution of 1:500 (India His-Probe, Pierce Chemical). Both filters were labeled using diaminobenzamidine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Steady-state ATPase Assays—Actin-activated ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C as described previously (16Joel P.B. Trybus K.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2998-3003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). NH4+ -activated ATPase was determined at 37 °C, using a buffer containing 400 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris base (pH 8.0 at 37 °C), 200 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml BSA (15Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Motility and Average Force Measurements—For all motility experiments, 1.2–3.5 μm HMM was mixed with a 2.5-fold molar excess of F-actin in the presence of 1 mm MgATP, and centrifuged for 25 min at 350,000 × g to remove ATP-insensitive cross-bridge heads. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar), and dilutions were made to the appropriate concentrations for either measurement of unloaded maximum velocity, or average force (see below). Polyacrylamide SDS gels run on these supernatants confirmed the accuracy of the concentrations and indicated that the amount of contaminating actin was less than 5%. HMMs were anchored to the coverslip using antibody S2.2 (18Trybus K.M. Henry L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2879-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and actin filament movement was measured as described previously (16Joel P.B. Trybus K.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2998-3003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Warshaw D.M. Desrosiers J.M. Work S.S. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The basic buffer typically used for actin treatment and washing in the flow cell (see below) contained 60 mm KCl, 25 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4 at 30 °C), 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm DTT (buffer A). The final assay buffer additionally contained 0.7% methylcellulose, an oxygen scavenger mixture (containing 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.018 mg/ml catalase, and 2.3 mg/ml glucose), and 1 mm MgATP. In some experiments, the concentration of KCl in the buffer was changed to 25 or 90 mm. Measurements of average force were made on the motility surface using α-actinin as a load, which impeded the movement of actin (20Bing W. Knott A. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). α-Actinin (Sigma) was dialyzed into buffer A with 1 rather than 10 mm DTT and clarified for 25 min at 350,000 × g. Its concentration was determined using BSA as a standard (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). The following components were added sequentially to the flow cell: 1) 25 μg/ml S2.2 antibody for 1 min, wash with buffer A; 2) α-actinin for 1 min, wash with buffer A, including 0.5 mg/ml BSA; 3) HMM for 1 min, wash with buffer A; and finally 4) actin for 2× 30 s. Finally, buffer A containing methylcellulose, oxygen scavengers, and ATP was added, and the filaments were observed under fluorescent illumination. The concentration of α-actinin which just stopped filament movement on the motility surface was determined for different HMM concentrations. The “stopping concentration” of α-actinin was defined by the long, straight, “taut” appearance of the filaments, as well as their failure to move. The precision of these measurements was defined as one-half the concentration difference between the stopping point as defined above and the closest lesser α-actinin concentration at which long, taut filaments were not observed. ADP Release from Acto-HMM—The rate of ADP release was determined by mixing acto-HMM·(100 μm ADP) with 2 mm MgATP, and measuring acto-HMM dissociation either by the decrease in light scattering or the increase in pyrene actin fluorescence. Actin was labeled with pyrene-iodoacetamide as described previously (16Joel P.B. Trybus K.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2998-3003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Experiments were done in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT at 20 °C using a Kin-Tek stopped-flow spectrophotometer and a 100-watt mercury lamp. For 90° light scattering, the exciting beam was passed through a 294-nm interference filter, and the emission was detected with a 294-nm interference filter. Pyrene actin was excited using a 360-nm interference filter, and emission was detected with a 400-nm cutoff filter. Transients are the average of at least three independent mixings. The signal averaging and fitting was done using Kin-Tek software. Isolation of Homogeneous Heterodimer Preparations—By placing unique epitope tags on the two species of heavy chain included in a given heterodimer, we were able to isolate homogeneous preparations of HMM with two different heads. We prepared and characterized two heterodimers. One was composed of two naturally occurring smooth muscle heavy chain isoforms that differ in their cycling rates by a factor of two due to the presence or absence of a seven amino acid insert in loop 1. The second heterodimer contained the WT inserted heavy chain along with a non-cycling head created by a point mutation in switch 2 (E470A/WT HMM) (11Onishi H. Morales M.F. Kojima S. Katoh K. Fujiwara K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3767-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Onishi H. Kojima S. Katoh K. Fujiwara K. Martinez H.M. Morales M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6653-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The flowchart in Fig. 1 illustrates the stages of this purification for the (+insert/–insert) heterodimer, along with Western blots depicting the amounts of FLAG- and His-reactive material in each step. The sensitivities of our anti-FLAG and anti-His probes were adjusted to give approximately the same amount of staining when reacted with equal amounts of the respective control proteins (Fig. 1B, lane S). The protein that was loaded onto the FLAG column (Fig. 1B, lane 1) contained nearly equal amounts of FLAG-labeled (+insert) heavy chain and His-labeled (–insert) heavy chain. As expected, the flowthrough from the anti-FLAG column contained predominantly His-tagged molecules (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The small amount of FLAG immunoreactivity in this fraction indicated that the column was loaded with more FLAG-labeled material than it had the capacity to bind. Protein eluted from this column contained both FLAG-labeled homodimers of the +insert heavy chain and heterodimers (Fig. 1A, step 3 and Fig. 1B, lane 3). After loading this mixture onto the poly-histidine binding column, a small amount of the His-reactive material was seen in the flowthrough due to supersaturation of the column, along with a large excess of FLAG-tagged protein (Fig. 1B, lane 4). After washing with loading buffer, a more stringent wash with buffer containing 10 mm imidazole-HCl was employed to release any nonspecifically bound FLAG-FLAG homodimer (data not shown). Elution with 300 mm imidazole buffer liberated the final, homogeneous preparation of heterodimeric HMM (Fig. 1B, lane 5), which had equal amounts of FLAG- and His-reactive material in it. Western blots conducted on preparations of the heterodimeric E470A/WT HMM gave the same results (21Kad N.M. Rovner A.S. Fagnant P.M. Warshaw D.M. Trybus K.M. Biophys. J. 2003; 84 (abstr.): 328aGoogle Scholar). NH4+ -ATPase activity was used to quantitatively assess the homogeneity of the heterodimeric E470A/WT HMM preparation, because one of the two heads is virtually inactive (Table I). Homodimeric WT HMM had NH4+ -ATPase activity of 24.2 ± 2.8 s–1, whereas the activity of the homodimeric E470A was barely measurable, even though 50–100 times as much of this protein was used in the assay as the other two species (12Onishi H. Kojima S. Katoh K. Fujiwara K. Martinez H.M. Morales M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6653-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The activity of heterodimeric E470A/WT HMM was half that for the homodimeric WT HMM, supporting our contention that this preparation contains exclusively heterodimeric molecules.Table INH4+ -ATPase activity of HMMs with WT and E470A headsHMMRates-1E470A HMM0.01E470A/WT HMM12.0 ± 0.8WT HMM24.2 ± 2.8 Open table in a new tab Actin-activated ATPase of the Heterodimer Is Comparable to a 50:50 Mix of Homodimers—The actin-activated ATPase activity of the heterodimeric (+insert/–insert) HMM was compared with the corresponding homodimers, as well as an equal mix of these two isoforms (Fig. 2). Measurements were made at an actin concentration of 40 μm, which is greater than the K m for each of these species (6Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Mus. Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of the homodimeric (–insert) HMM was approximately half that of homodimeric (+insert) HMM, as we have shown previously (6Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Mus. Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The rate of the heterodimer was the same as an equal mixture of the two homodimers, at a value intermediate between the rates shown by the homodimers. Taken together with the NH4+ ATPase results of Table I, these data indicate that each of the heads in our heterodimers have steady-state ATPase activities that are unaffected by the other head, both in the presence or absence of actin. Rate of ADP Release from Acto-HMM by Two Techniques— The release of ADP from the nucleotide-binding pocket is thought to be the step in the cross-bridge cycle that limits the velocity of actin movement by a given type of myosin (22Siemankowski R.F. Wiseman M.O. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Pyrene-labeled actin was used to measure the rate of ADP release from acto-HMM. When pyrene actin-HMM·ADP is mixed with excess ATP, pyrene fluorescence increases at the rate at which ADP leaves the active site and is replaced with ATP (23Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The time course of this fluorescence increase was best fit by a single exponential that was ∼4-fold faster for the +insert HMM than the –insert HMM (Table II). Phosphorylation had little effect on this rate. When measured over a range of temperatures, the Q10 value for this kinetic step was ∼3. Although our ADP release measurements showed a 4-fold difference between the +insert and –insert species, our current and previous (6Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Mus. Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) comparisons of velocities by the motility assay indicate a 2-fold difference between these isoforms. These results suggest that other steps in the cross-bridge cycle in addition to ADP release may limit the velocity of actin filament movement.Table IIADP release rates of homodimeric (+insert) and (-insert) HMMs compared to heterodimeric (+insert/-insert) HMM obtained by pyrene fluorescenceProteinPhos stateFitRateχ2SlowFasts-1(-/-) HomodimerDePS9.5 ± 0.50.09(+/+) HomodimerDePS52.3 ± 0.30.02PhosS46.7 ± 0.20.0550:50 Homodimeric mixtureDePD10.5 ± 0.0638.3 ± 0.30.15S16.8 ± 0.201.00(+/-) HeterodimerDePD9.4 ± 0.1637.8 ± 0.800.12S16.3 ± 0.201.10PhosD7.6 ± 0.1633.6 ± 0.670.05S15.2 ± 0.160.52 Open table in a new tab The difference in ADP release rates of the homodimers allowed us to probe the properties of heterodimeric (+insert/–insert) HMM (Table II). As expected, the fluorescence time course of the 50:50 mixture of dephosphorylated homodimers was better fit by an equation with two exponential terms than one, yielding rate constants of about 10 and 40 s–1, similar to the values determined from the homodimers (Table II). The heterodimer, independent of its phosphorylation state, also yielded two rates that were ∼4-fold different and nearly equal in amplitude, suggesting independent head action. ADP release rates were also measured by monitoring the decrease in light scattering of acto-HMM·ADP caused by rapid mixing with excess ATP (Table III and Fig. 3; see “Experimental Procedures”). This technique gave essentially the same results as had been obtained by pyrene fluorescence quenching for the homodimeric HMMs (Fig. 3, A and B), as well as the mixtures of homodimers (Fig. 3C and Table III). However, in contrast to the pyrene data, the light scattering signals for six different preparations of the heterodimeric HMM were better fit by a single exponential with a rate of 14–15 s–1, closer to the value obtained for the homodimeric (–insert) HMM (Fig. 3D and Table III). This observation is the first demonstration that the light scattering signal measures the movement of the entire double-headed HMM molecule away from the mass of the actin filament, whereas pyrene fluorescence gives an independent assessment of the rate of ADP release from each head. Because the slower head will dictate the rate at which the entire HMM can move away from actin, a rate dominated by the slower head is expected and was observed.Table IIIADP release rates of homodimeric (+insert) and (-insert) HMMs compared to heterodimeric (+insert/-insert) HMM obtained by light scatteringProteinPhos stateFitRateχ2SlowFasts-1(-/-) HomodimerDePS8.6 ± 0.020.043PhosS13.6 ± 0.300.018(+/+) HomodimerDePS37.8 ± 0.20.096PhosS43.8 ± 0.30.02150:50 Homodimeric mixtureDePD10.2 ± 0.0433.2 ± 0.200.026S15.9 ± 0.120.240PhosD13.4 ± 0.0943.0 ± 0.400.038S21.2 ± 0.200.160(+/-) HeterodimerDePS14.2 ± 0.070.054PhosS15.4 ± 0.100.084 Open table in a new tab Motility of the Heterodimers—Both the E470A/WT HMM and the +insert/–insert HMM heterodimers were assayed for their ability to move actin in the in vitro motility assay.

Surprisingly, heterodimeric E470A/WT HMM showed an average velocity (cross-hatched bar, 1.50 ± 0.19 μm/s) in 60 mm KCl buffer that was nearly 95% as great as that of WT HMM (black bar, 1.58 ± 0.20 μm/s).
