https://openalex.org/W2153056550,"A powerful way to discover key genes with causal roles in oncogenesis is to identify genomic regions that undergo frequent alteration in human cancers. Here we present high-resolution analyses of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) from 3,131 cancer specimens, belonging largely to 26 histological types. We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-kappaBeta pathway. We show that cancer cells containing amplifications surrounding the MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend on the expression of these genes for survival. Finally, we demonstrate that a large majority of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are present in several cancer types."

https://openalex.org/W2079267430,"Innate immunity represents the first line of inducible defence against microbial infection in plants and animals. In both kingdoms, recognition of pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs, respectively), such as flagellin, initiates convergent signalling pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and global transcriptional changes to boost immunity. Although Ca(2+) has long been recognized as an essential and conserved primary mediator in plant defence responses, how Ca(2+) signals are sensed and relayed into early MAMP signalling is unknown. Using a functional genomic screen and genome-wide gene expression profiling, here we show that four calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are Ca(2+)-sensor protein kinases critical for transcriptional reprogramming in plant innate immune signalling. Unexpectedly, CDPKs and MAPK cascades act differentially in four MAMP-mediated regulatory programs to control early genes involved in the synthesis of defence peptides and metabolites, cell wall modifications and redox signalling. Transcriptome profile comparison suggests that CDPKs are the convergence point of signalling triggered by most MAMPs. Double, triple and quadruple cpk mutant plants display progressively diminished oxidative burst and gene activation induced by the 22-amino-acid peptide flg22, as well as compromised pathogen defence. In contrast to negative roles of calmodulin and a calmodulin-activated transcription factor in plant defence, the present study reveals Ca(2+) signalling complexity and demonstrates key positive roles of specific CDPKs in initial MAMP signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2071734901,"The cancer genome is moulded by the dual processes of somatic mutation and selection. Homozygous deletions in cancer genomes occur over recessive cancer genes, where they can confer selective growth advantage, and over fragile sites, where they are thought to reflect an increased local rate of DNA breakage. However, most homozygous deletions in cancer genomes are unexplained. Here we identified 2,428 somatic homozygous deletions in 746 cancer cell lines. These overlie 11% of protein-coding genes that, therefore, are not mandatory for survival of human cells. We derived structural signatures that distinguish between homozygous deletions over recessive cancer genes and fragile sites. Application to clusters of unexplained homozygous deletions suggests that many are in regions of inherent fragility, whereas a small subset overlies recessive cancer genes. The results illustrate how structural signatures can be used to distinguish between the influences of mutation and selection in cancer genomes. The extensive copy number, genotyping, sequence and expression data available for this large series of publicly available cancer cell lines renders them informative reagents for future studies of cancer biology and drug discovery. Two Articles in this issue add major data sets to the growing picture of the cancer genome. Bignell et al. analysed a large number of homozygous gene deletions in a collection of 746 publicly available cancer cell lines. Combined with information about hemizygous deletions of the same genes, the data suggest that many deletions found in cancer reflect the position of a gene at a fragile site in the genome, rather than as a recessive cancer gene whose loss confers a selective growth advantage. Beroukhim et al. present the largest data set to date on somatic copy-number variations across more than 3,000 specimens of human primary cancers. Many alterations are shared between multiple tumour types. Functional experiments demonstrate an oncogenic role for the apoptosis genes MCL1 and BCL2L1 that are associated with amplifications found in many cancers. Homozygous gene deletions in cancer cells occur over recessive cancer genes (where they can confer selective growth advantage) or over genes at fragile sites of the genome (where they are thought to reflect increased DNA breakage). Here, a large number of homozygous deletions in a collection of cancer cell lines are identified and analysed to derive structural signatures for the two different types of deletion. More deletions are found in inherently fragile regions, and fewer overlying recessive genes."
https://openalex.org/W2040891039,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), retrovirus-like elements with long terminal repeats, are widely dispersed in the euchromatic compartment in mammalian cells, comprising approximately 10% of the mouse genome. These parasitic elements are responsible for >10% of spontaneous mutations. Whereas DNA methylation has an important role in proviral silencing in somatic and germ-lineage cells, an additional DNA-methylation-independent pathway also functions in embryonal carcinoma and embryonic stem (ES) cells to inhibit transcription of the exogenous gammaretrovirus murine leukaemia virus (MLV). Notably, a recent genome-wide study revealed that ERVs are also marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H4K20me3 in ES cells but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, the role that these marks have in proviral silencing remains unexplored. Here we show that the H3K9 methyltransferase ESET (also called SETDB1 or KMT1E) and the Kr√ºppel-associated box (KRAB)-associated protein 1 (KAP1, also called TRIM28) are required for H3K9me3 and silencing of endogenous and introduced retroviruses specifically in mouse ES cells. Furthermore, whereas ESET enzymatic activity is crucial for HP1 binding and efficient proviral silencing, the H4K20 methyltransferases Suv420h1 and Suv420h2 are dispensable for silencing. Notably, in DNA methyltransferase triple knockout (Dnmt1(-/-)Dnmt3a(-/-)Dnmt3b(-/-)) mouse ES cells, ESET and KAP1 binding and ESET-mediated H3K9me3 are maintained and ERVs are minimally derepressed. We propose that a DNA-methylation-independent pathway involving KAP1 and ESET/ESET-mediated H3K9me3 is required for proviral silencing during the period early in embryogenesis when DNA methylation is dynamically reprogrammed."
https://openalex.org/W2110612987,"The phenotypic differences between individual organisms can often be ascribed to underlying genetic and environmental variation. However, even genetically identical organisms in homogeneous environments vary, indicating that randomness in developmental processes such as gene expression may also generate diversity. To examine the consequences of gene expression variability in multicellular organisms, we studied intestinal specification in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which wild-type cell fate is invariant and controlled by a small transcriptional network. Mutations in elements of this network can have indeterminate effects: some mutant embryos fail to develop intestinal cells, whereas others produce intestinal precursors. By counting transcripts of the genes in this network in individual embryos, we show that the expression of an otherwise redundant gene becomes highly variable in the mutants and that this variation is subjected to a threshold, producing an ON/OFF expression pattern of the master regulatory gene of intestinal differentiation. Our results demonstrate that mutations in developmental networks can expose otherwise buffered stochastic variability in gene expression, leading to pronounced phenotypic variation."
https://openalex.org/W1964823826,"The recognition of foreign antigens by T lymphocytes is essential to most adaptive immune responses. It is driven by specific T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) binding to antigenic peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules on other cells. If productive, these interactions promote the formation of an immunological synapse. Here we show that synaptic TCR-pMHC binding dynamics differ significantly from TCR-pMHC binding in solution. We used single-molecule microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescently tagged TCRs and their cognate pMHC ligands to measure the kinetics of TCR-pMHC binding in situ. When compared with solution measurements, the dissociation of this complex was increased significantly (4-12-fold). Disruption of actin polymers reversed this effect, indicating that cytoskeletal dynamics destabilize this interaction directly or indirectly. Nevertheless, TCR affinity for pMHC was significantly elevated as the result of a large (about 100-fold) increase in the association rate, a likely consequence of complementary molecular orientation and clustering. In helper T cells, the CD4 molecule has been proposed to bind cooperatively with the TCR to the same pMHC complex. However, CD4 blockade had no effect on the synaptic TCR affinity, nor did it destabilize TCR-pMHC complexes, indicating that the TCR binds pMHC independently of CD4."
https://openalex.org/W2118843707,"Patients with dyskeratosis congenita, a disorder of telomere maintenance, suffer degeneration of multiple tissues. Agarwal et al. use iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cell technology to study the mechanisms underlying the disease in humans, and in doing so they discover that reprogramming restores telomere elongation in dyskeratosis congenita cells despite genetic lesions affecting telomerase. The reprogrammed dyskeratosis congenita cells were able to overcome a critical limitation in telomerase RNA component (TERC) levels to restore telomere maintenance and self-renewal, and multiple telomerase components are targeted by pluripotency-associated transcription factors. Strategies designed to increase TERC expression may therefore be therapeutically beneficial in dyskeratosis congenita patients. Here, iPS cell technology is used to study the mechanisms underlying dyskeratosis congenita in humans. Reprogramming restores telomere elongation in dyskeratosis congenita cells despite genetic lesions affecting telomerase. The reprogrammed cells were able to overcome a critical limitation in telomerase RNA component (TERC) levels to restore telomere maintenance and self-renewal, and multiple telomerase components are targeted by pluripotency-associated transcription factors. Patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a disorder of telomere maintenance, suffer degeneration of multiple tissues1,2,3. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells4 represent invaluable in vitro models for human degenerative disorders like DC. A cardinal feature of iPS cells is acquisition of indefinite self-renewal capacity, which is accompanied by induction of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT)5,6,7. We investigated whether defects in telomerase function would limit derivation and maintenance of iPS cells from patients with DC. Here we show that reprogrammed DC cells overcome a critical limitation in telomerase RNA component (TERC) levels to restore telomere maintenance and self-renewal. We discovered that TERC upregulation is a feature of the pluripotent state, that several telomerase components are targeted by pluripotency-associated transcription factors, and that in autosomal dominant DC, transcriptional silencing accompanies a 3‚Ä≤ deletion at the TERC locus. Our results demonstrate that reprogramming restores telomere elongation in DC cells despite genetic lesions affecting telomerase, and show that strategies to increase TERC expression may be therapeutically beneficial in DC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2119367243,"It is widely accepted that strong and variable radiation detected over all accessible energy bands in a number of active galaxies arises from a relativistic, Doppler-boosted jet pointing close to our line of sight. The size of the emitting zone and the location of this region relative to the central supermassive black hole are, however, poorly known, with estimates ranging from light-hours to a light-year or more. Here we report the coincidence of a gamma-ray flare with a dramatic change of optical polarization angle. This provides evidence for co-spatiality of optical and gamma-ray emission regions and indicates a highly ordered jet magnetic field. The results also require a non-axisymmetric structure of the emission zone, implying a curved trajectory for the emitting material within the jet, with the dissipation region located at a considerable distance from the black hole, at about 10^5 gravitational radii."

https://openalex.org/W2059288735,"Behavioural learning depends on the brain's capacity to respond to instructive experience and is often enhanced during a juvenile sensitive period. How instructive experience acts on the juvenile brain to trigger behavioural learning remains unknown. In vitro studies show that forms of synaptic strengthening thought to underlie learning are accompanied by an increase in the stability, number and size of dendritic spines, which are the major sites of excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate brain. In vivo imaging studies in sensory cortical regions reveal that these structural features can be affected by disrupting sensory experience and that spine turnover increases during sensitive periods for sensory map formation. These observations support two hypotheses: first, the increased capacity for behavioural learning during a sensitive period is associated with enhanced spine dynamics on sensorimotor neurons important for the learned behaviour; second, instructive experience rapidly stabilizes and strengthens these dynamic spines. Here we report a test of these hypotheses using two-photon in vivo imaging to measure spine dynamics in zebra finches, which learn to sing by imitating a tutor song during a juvenile sensitive period. Spine dynamics were measured in the forebrain nucleus HVC, the proximal site where auditory information merges with an explicit song motor representation, immediately before and after juvenile finches first experienced tutor song. Higher levels of spine turnover before tutoring correlated with a greater capacity for subsequent song imitation. In juveniles with high levels of spine turnover, hearing a tutor song led to the rapid ( approximately 24-h) stabilization, accumulation and enlargement of dendritic spines in HVC. Moreover, in vivo intracellular recordings made immediately before and after the first day of tutoring revealed robust enhancement of synaptic activity in HVC. These findings suggest that behavioural learning results when instructive experience is able to rapidly stabilize and strengthen synapses on sensorimotor neurons important for the control of the learned behaviour."

https://openalex.org/W2051490833,"Mutations in the mitochondrial encoded protein PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) cause autosomal recessive Parkinson disease (PD). In mammalian cells, mutant PINK1 has been reported to promote fission or inhibit fusion in mitochondria; however, the mechanism by which this process occurs remains elusive. Using an ecdysone-inducible expression system in mammalian dopaminergic neuronal cells, we report here that human mutant PINK1 (L347P and W437X) mediates an overall fission effect by increasing the ratio of mitochondrial fission over fusion proteins, leading to excessive dysfunctional fragmented mitochondria. Knocking down endogenous Pink1 produces similar effects. In contrast, overexpressing human wild type PINK1 produces a pro-fusion effect by increasing the ratio of mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins without resulting in functionally compromised mitochondria. Parkin knockdown blocks the imbalance in fission/fusion proteins. Furthermore, overexpressing parkin and ubiquitin increases degradation of the mitochondrial fission hFis1 protein, suggesting PINK1 and parkin maintain proper mitochondrial function and integrity via the fission/fusion machinery. Through genetic manipulations and treatment with the small molecule mitochondrial division inhibitor (mdivi-1), which inhibits DLP1/Drp1, both structural and functional mitochondrial defects induced by mutant PINK1 were attenuated, highlighting a potential novel therapeutic avenue for Parkinson disease."
https://openalex.org/W1970451788,"There is wide agreement that type Ia supernovae (used as standard candles for cosmology) are associated with the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars. The nuclear runaway that leads to the explosion could start in a white dwarf gradually accumulating matter from a companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit, or could be triggered by the merger of two white dwarfs in a compact binary system. The X-ray signatures of these two possible paths are very different. Whereas no strong electromagnetic emission is expected in the merger scenario until shortly before the supernova, the white dwarf accreting material from the normal star becomes a source of copious X-rays for about 10(7) years before the explosion. This offers a means of determining which path dominates. Here we report that the observed X-ray flux from six nearby elliptical galaxies and galaxy bulges is a factor of approximately 30-50 less than predicted in the accretion scenario, based upon an estimate of the supernova rate from their K-band luminosities. We conclude that no more than about five per cent of type Ia supernovae in early-type galaxies can be produced by white dwarfs in accreting binary systems, unless their progenitors are much younger than the bulk of the stellar population in these galaxies, or explosions of sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs make a significant contribution to the supernova rate."
https://openalex.org/W2023869046,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥ (PPARŒ≥) gained considerable interest as a therapeutic target during chronic inflammatory diseases. Remarkably, the pathogenesis of diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer is associated with impaired PPARŒ≥ expression. Considering that regulation of PPARŒ≥ expression during inflammation is largely unknown, we were interested in elucidating underlying mechanisms. To this end, we initiated an inflammatory response by exposing primary human macrophages to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and observed a rapid decline of PPARŒ≥1 expression. Because promoter activities were not affected by LPS, we focused on mRNA stability and noticed a decreased mRNA half-life. As RNA stability is often regulated via 3‚Ä≤-untranslated regions (UTRs), we analyzed the impact of the PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR by reporter assays using specific constructs. LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the pGL3-PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR, suggesting that PPARŒ≥1 mRNA is destabilized. Deletion or mutation of a potential microRNA-27a/b (miR-27a/b) binding site within the 3‚Ä≤-UTR restored luciferase activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-27b, which was induced upon LPS exposure, partially reversed PPARŒ≥1 mRNA decay, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased PPARŒ≥1 mRNA content. In addition, LPS further reduced this decay. The functional relevance of miR-27b-dependent PPARŒ≥1 decrease was proven by inhibition or overexpression of miR-27b, which affected LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor Œ± (TNFŒ±) and interleukin (IL)-6. We provide evidence that LPS-induced miR-27b contributes to destabilization of PPARŒ≥1 mRNA. Understanding molecular mechanisms decreasing PPARŒ≥ might help to better appreciate inflammatory diseases.

Understanding molecular mechanisms decreasing PPARŒ≥ might help to better appreciate inflammatory diseases. Inflammation is highly regulated. A pro-inflammatory response is rapidly initiated, whereas resolution of inflammation follows the initial challenge. Dampening inflammation is crucial to return to homeostasis, whereas prolonged and unhalted inflammation explains the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory diseases (1Serhan C.N. Chiang N. Van Dyke T.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). Resolution of inflammation is partly achieved by regulating mRNA stability of pro-inflammatory mediators at the post-transcriptional level thus, guaranteeing a rapid response. Regulated transcripts often contain an AU-rich 3‚Ä≤-untranslated region (3‚Ä≤-UTR). 2The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionAREAU-rich element, DRB, 5‚Äì6 dichloro-1-Œ≤-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazoleIFNŒ≥interferon Œ≥ILinterleukinLPSlipopolysaccharidemiRNAmicroRNANFŒ∫Bnuclear factor Œ∫BPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePPARŒ≥peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥qPCRquantitative PCRTLRToll-like receptorTNFtumor necrosis factor. Sequences within the 3‚Ä≤-UTR are recognized by either AU-rich element (ARE)-binding proteins such as tristetraprolin but also by microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) (reviewed in Ref. 2Stoecklin G. Anderson P. Adv. Immunol. 2006; 89: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which targets mRNAs for exosomal degradation. miRNAs present a large family of small non-coding RNAs with a length of ‚àº22 nucleotides. They are transcribed as primary miRNAs, which are processed by Drosha and Dicer to precursor and finally mature miRNAs (reviewed in Ref. 3Winter J. Jung S. Keller S. Gregory R.I. Diederichs S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). The mature miRNA is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). There it associates with Argonaute proteins to target specific mRNAs via base pairing between the 3‚Ä≤-UTR of the mRNA and the 5‚Ä≤-end of the miRNA, the so called seed region. RNA is then degraded upon recruitment of several proteins such as deadenylase complex, decapping enzymes, or activators (reviewed in Ref. 4Eulalio A. Huntzinger E. Izaurralde E. Cell. 2008; 132: 9-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Functionally miRNAs play an eminent role in controlling immune responses and have been associated with several inflammatory diseases (5Sheedy F.J. O'Neill L.A. Ann. Rheum.

However, TLR activation also triggers induction of miRNAs such as miR-21 or miR-132 (5Sheedy F.J. O'Neill L.A. Ann. Rheum.

Transcript variants 1 and 3 code for PPARŒ≥1 whereas transcript variant 2 codes for PPARŒ≥2, which is mainly expressed in adipocytes (8Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Rasp√© E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M.

Consequently macrophages mainly express PPARŒ≥1 (10Ricote M. Huang J. Fajas L. Li A. Welch J. Najib J. Witztum J.L. Auwerx J. Palinski W. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7614-7619Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). In macrophages PPARŒ≥ represses inducible nitric-oxide (NO) synthase induction as well as concomitant NO production (11Li M. Pascual G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4699-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and attenuates the oxidative burst (13Von Knethen A. Br√ºne B.

Moreover, inhibiting nuclear factor Œ∫B (NFŒ∫B) decreases expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor Œ± (TNFŒ±) or IL-6 (12Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M.

Thus, PPARŒ≥ is important to shape an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype and appears crucial for dampening inflammation (15Serhan C.N. Savill J. Nat.

Interestingly, these disease conditions often revealed impaired PPARŒ≥ abundance (16Kobayashi M. Thomassen M.J. Rambasek T. Bonfield T.L. Raychaudhuri B. Malur A. Winkler A.R. Barna B.P. Goldman S.J.

Because mechanisms attenuating PPARŒ≥ expression remained obscure, we investigated regulation of PPARŒ≥ during inflammation. Here we provide evidence that PPARŒ≥1 mRNA is destabilized by miR-27b, which is induced in macrophages upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure.

Rosiglitazone was bought from Biomol GmbH (Hamburg, Germany), human recombinant TNFŒ± came from PeproTech GmbH (Hamburg, Germany) and human recombinant interferon Œ≥ (IFNŒ≥) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Oligonucleotides were bought from Biomers (Ulm, Germany). THP-1 monocytes were cultured at 37 ¬∞C, 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 Œºg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 5 mm glutamine. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages by treatment with 50 nm PMA overnight and cultured for another 24 h in fresh medium prior to experiments. Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coats (DRK-Blutspendedienst Baden-W√ºrttemberg-Hessen, Institut f√ºr Transfusionsmedizin und Immunh√§matologie, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) using Ficoll-Hypaque gradients as described (14Johann A.M. von Knethen A.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were washed twice with PBS and were allowed to adhere to culture dishes for 1 h at 37 ¬∞C. Non-adherent cells were removed and monocytes were then differentiated into macrophages by culturing them in RPMI 1640 containing 100 Œºg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 5 mm glutamine, and 10% AB positive human serum for 7 days. Western analysis was performed as described previously (18von Knethen A. Soller M. Tzieply N. Weigert A. Johann A.M. Jennewein C. K√∂hl R. Br√ºne B. J.

For reporter analysis 1 √ó 105/well THP-1 monocytes were seeded in 24-well plates and differentiated into macrophages. After 24 h culturing in fresh medium, cells were transfected with 0.75 Œºg of the different plasmids using JetPEI‚Ñ¢ transfection reagent (Polyplus transfection, Illkirch, France) as described by the manufacturer. After transfection, cells were cultured in fresh medium for another 24 h prior to treatments. All reporter assays were performed in duplicate. Cell extracts were prepared after treatment with LPS (1 Œºg/ml) for 3 or 6 h. Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity or protein concentration of each sample. PPARŒ≥ promoter 1 and 3 activity was determined by using the constructs pGL3-Œ≥1p3000 (8Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Rasp√© E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.C. Deeb S.

Auwerx, Institut de G√©n√©tique et de Biologie Mol√©culaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France). To investigate PPARŒ≥ activity we performed reporter assays using the previously described peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) reporter construct pAOX-TKL (19Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). To analyze the impact of the PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR, cells were transfected with the pGL3-control vector, pGL3-PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR, pGL3-PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR-ŒîmiR-27, and pGL3-PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR-C83A/U84G, respectively. miRNA mimic and anti-miRNA inhibitors were transfected into primary human macrophages using Amaxa¬Æ Nucleofector¬Æ technology from Lonza Cologne AG (Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 1.5 √ó 106 cells were transfected with 100‚Äì300 pmol of anti-miR-27a/b inhibitor or the anti-miR inhibitor negative control (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and 0.1, 1, or 10 pmol miR-27b mimic (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) or 0.5‚Äì2 Œºg Allstars negative control siRNA (Qiagen). Following transfection cells were seeded on 3-cm Primaria dishes and cultured for another 48 h prior to experiments. Total RNA was isolated using PeqGold RNAPure Kit (PeqLab Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) as described by the manufacturer. Reverse transcription was done with 1 Œºg of RNA using iScript‚Ñ¢ cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad GmbH, Munich, Germany) or the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) for transcription of miRNAs. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with Absolute QPCR SYBRGreen Fluorescein Mix (Abgene, Hamburg, Germany) or miScript SYBR¬Æ Green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Amplification and data analysis were done using the MyiQ iCycler system from Bio-Rad. The following primer pairs were selected: 18 S forward: 5‚Ä≤-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3‚Ä≤, 18 S reverse: 5‚Ä≤-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3‚Ä≤, actin forward: 5‚Ä≤-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3‚Ä≤, actin reverse: 5‚Ä≤-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3‚Ä≤, PPARŒ≥-transcript variant 1 forward: 5‚Ä≤-GGCCCAGCGCACTCGGA-3‚Ä≤, PPARŒ≥-transcript variant 3 forward: 5‚Ä≤-GCTGGTGACCAGAAGCCTGCAT-3‚Ä≤, PPARŒ≥-exon1 reverse: 5‚Ä≤-GGCCAGAATGGCATCTCTGTGT-3‚Ä≤, TNFŒ± forward: 5‚Ä≤-TCTCGAACCCCGAGTGACA-3‚Ä≤, TNFŒ± reverse: 5‚Ä≤-GAGGAGCACATGGGTGGAG-3‚Ä≤. For determination of PPARŒ≥1 and IL-6 mRNA as well as miR-27a/b and Rnu6B expression we used QuantiTect¬Æ Primer Assays (Qiagen). Values were normalized to 18 S ribosomal RNA, actin, or Rnu6B expression, respectively. Each experiment was performed at least three times and statistical analysis was done with paired or unpaired Student's t test. In the case of Western analysis representative data of at least three independently performed experiments are shown. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. Because mechanisms regulating PPARŒ≥ expression during inflammation are poorly understood, we investigated PPARŒ≥1 regulation in macrophages. First we analyzed the mRNA level of transcript variants 1 and 3 both coding for the protein PPARŒ≥1 during macrophage differentiation. To this end monocytes/macrophages were stimulated with 1 Œºg/ml LPS for 3 h at 1 h, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days after isolation from buffy coats, and RNA was extracted. Expression of transcript variants 1 and 3 was determined by qPCR using specific oligonucleotides. Monocytes showed very low but similar abundance of transcript variants 1 and 3, while we predominantly observed induction of the PPARŒ≥ transcript variant 3 during differentiation (10-fold at day 7, see Fig. 1A). A minor induction of transcript variant 1 was observed after 3 days (1.3-fold), and a reduction in fully differentiated macrophages (0.58-fold at day 7) in comparison to monocytes (1 h). Upon LPS exposure, both variants were down-regulated (Fig. 1A). Next, we analyzed temporal pattern of total PPARŒ≥1 mRNA expression (transcript variants 1 and 3) in response to 1 Œºg/ml LPS. There was a slight increase of PPARŒ≥1 mRNA after 30 min followed by a rapid decrease of PPARŒ≥1 with the lowest mRNA amounts after 6 h. Extended incubation periods allowed to recover PPARŒ≥1 mRNA content nearly reaching control levels after 24 h of LPS treatment (Fig. 1B). The same pattern was observed in differentiated THP-1 macrophages. As seen in Fig. 1C, 3 h of LPS exposure significantly decreased PPARŒ≥1 mRNA to ‚àº20% in comparison to unstimulated cells. To investigate whether a decrease of mRNA is reflected at protein level, we analyzed protein expression and PPARŒ≥ transactivation by reporter assay. Western analysis showed a time-dependent reduction of protein expression with a minimum at 8 h, again increasing afterward (Fig. 1D). To determine PPARŒ≥ transactivation, we transfected differentiated THP-1 macrophages with the PPRE reporter plasmid pAOX-TKL and pretreated cells the next day with 1 Œºg/ml LPS for 4 h followed by stimulation with 5 Œºm rosiglitazone for 4 h. Rosiglitazone, a well established synthetic PPARŒ≥ agonist (20Yki-J√§rvinen H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 1106-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar), induced luciferase expression in control cells, whereas prestimulation with LPS prevented transactivation by rosiglitazone (Fig. 1E). LPS alone did not alter basal luciferase expression (data not shown). To determine whether down-regulation of PPARŒ≥1 mRNA results from transcriptional regulation, we performed luciferase reporter assays using the PPARŒ≥ promoter 1 (pGL3-Œ≥1p3000) and 3 (pGL3-Œ≥3p800) constructs, containing the individual promoters upstream of the luciferase encoding region. Therefore, we transfected THP-1 macrophages with pGL3-Œ≥1p3000 or pGL3-Œ≥3p800 and stimulated them the next day with 1 Œºg/ml LPS for 3 and 6 h. LPS exposure attenuated PPARŒ≥ promoter 1 luciferase activity to ‚àº60% after 6 h, whereas luciferase activity of the PPARŒ≥ promoter 3 construct was only slightly reduced (Fig. 2A). Taking into consideration that fully differentiated macrophages express transcript variant 1 (resulting from activation of promoter 1) at low level only, we assumed that reduction of the promoter 1 activity to 60% is negligible for the LPS-induced PPARŒ≥1 mRNA decrease. Thus, we next analyzed post-transcriptional events. Because regulation of mRNA stability is primarily mediated via the 3‚Ä≤-UTR, we analyzed the PPARŒ≥ mRNA sequences and noticed an AU-rich 3‚Ä≤-UTR, which is a typical feature of regulated mRNA transcripts. Therefore, we determined mRNA stability by exposing cells to the transcription inhibitor DRB (21Kim D.K. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Mol. Cells. 2001; 11: 267-274PubMed Google Scholar) and 1 Œºg/ml LPS. DRB alone reduced PPARŒ≥1 mRNA expression to ‚àº60% after 3 h, whereas DRB plus LPS decreased mRNA to 26% relative to untreated cells (Fig. 2B). Calculating the half-life of PPARŒ≥1 revealed a reduction from 173 to 99 min, indicating that the mRNA decrease is caused by destabilization. To strengthen our hypothesis we investigated the role of the PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR on mRNA stability by reporter assay. Therefore, we cloned the 3‚Ä≤-UTR downstream of the luciferase encoding region within the pGL3-control vector. Differentiated THP-1 cells were transfected with pGL3-control and pGL3-PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR respectively, and stimulated the next day with LPS for 3 and 6 h. LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR containing vector to ‚àº65% after 3 h and to 50% after 6 h relative to pGL3-control (Fig. 2C), underlining the importance of the 3‚Ä≤-UTR for PPARŒ≥1 mRNA stability. The in-depth analysis of the PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR (TargetScanHuman 5.1) revealed distinct AREs and a potential binding site for miR-27a/b (Fig. 3A). To elucidate the impact of miR-27a/b, we deleted or mutated the miR-27 sequence within the pGL3-PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤UTR vector (Fig. 3B) and measured luciferase activity in transiently transfected THP-1 macrophages. Deletion as well as mutation of the miR-27 site completely abolished the LPS-mediated reduction of luciferase activity (Fig. 3C), suggesting a miR-27-dependent mechanism. To see whether miR-27a and b are induced by LPS in macrophages, cells were stimulated with 1 Œºg/ml LPS for 2 h. We observed a 2.3-fold induction of miR-27b (Fig. 4A) and a 1.6-fold induction of miR-27a (supplemental Fig. S1A). Because inhibition of NFŒ∫B with several inhibitors prevented a LPS-mediated PPARŒ≥ decrease (22Necela B.M. Su W. Thompson E.A. Immunology. 2008; 125: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we pretreated macrophages with 10 Œºm of the NFŒ∫B inhibitor Bay11‚Äì7082 for 1 h followed by LPS exposure. Inhibition of NFŒ∫B prevented LPS-induced miR-27b up-regulation (Fig. 4A) and the PPARŒ≥1 mRNA decrease (Fig. 4B). Moreover analyzing expression of miR-27b and PPARŒ≥1 in response to the time of LPS treatment revealed an inverse correlation between PPARŒ≥1 mRNA and miR-27b expression (Fig. 4C). To finally prove that miR-27 mediates LPS-induced PPARŒ≥1 mRNA decay, we transfected primary macrophages with different concentrations of anti-miR-27 and stimulated cells with 1 Œºg/ml LPS for 3 h.FIGURE 4NFŒ∫B-dependent miR-27b expression. A, miR-27b expression was measured in primary human macrophages in response to LPS (1 Œºg/ml, 2 h) by qPCR. To investigate a role of NFŒ∫B, cells were prestimulated for 1 h with 10 Œºm Bay11‚Äì7082. Basal expression was set to 1. B, primary human macrophages were pretreated with Bay as in A followed by 3 h of LPS exposure. PPARŒ≥1 mRNA was determined by qPCR. C, temporal pattern of PPARŒ≥1 mRNA and miR-27b expression was measured by qPCR after stimulation with 1 Œºg/ml LPS. Data represent mean values ¬± S.E., n ‚â• 4. Statistics were analyzed with the paired Student's t test. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Anti-miR-27b prevented LPS-dependent PPARŒ≥1 mRNA reduction in a concentration-dependent manner compared with a negative control (Fig. 5A). Inhibition of miR-27a showed no effect on PPARŒ≥1 reduction upon LPS exposure (supplemental Fig. S1B). To analyze if inhibiting miR-27b also affects PPARŒ≥1 mRNA half-life, we transfected human macrophages with the anti-miR-27b, stimulated cells with DRB and LPS as before and measured PPARŒ≥1 mRNA expression. Inhibition of miR-27b impaired the ability of LPS to reduce the mRNA half-life (Fig. 5B), verifying the impact of miR-27b on PPARŒ≥1 destabilization. In line, transfection with the miR-27b mimic reduced PPARŒ≥1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). However, LPS treatment further reduced PPARŒ≥1 mRNA expression (Fig. 6B). Moreover, a 2-fold induction of miR-27b by transfecting cells with miR-27b mimic decreased PPARŒ≥1 mRNA to ‚àº70% (supplemental Fig. S2). To determine the impact of miR-27b overexpression on PPARŒ≥1 mRNA half-life, we transfected primary human macrophages with siControl or miR-27b mimic and added 100 Œºm DRB for 1 to 3 h. Interestingly miR-27b overexpression did not significantly reduce PPARŒ≥ mRNA half-life in comparison to siControl-transfected cells in the absence of LPS (Fig. 6C).FIGURE 6Overexpression of miR-27b reduces PPARŒ≥1 mRNA expression. A, primary human macrophages were transfected with different concentrations of miR-27b mimic (0.1, 1, or 10 pmol) or siControl, respectively. B, primary human macrophages were transfected with 10 pmol of miR-27b mimic or siControl and stimulated the next day with 1 Œºg/ml LPS for 3 h. C, primary human macrophages were transfected with 10 pmol of miR-27b mimic or siControl and treated for 1‚Äì3 h with 100 Œºm DRB 2 h after transfection. PPARŒ≥1 mRNA content was determined by qPCR. Data represent mean values ¬± S.E., n ‚â• 4. Statistics were analyzed with the paired Student's t test. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate if other pro-inflammatory stimuli besides LPS also decrease PPARŒ≥1 expression, we stimulated primary human macrophages with 15 ng/ml TNFŒ±, 10 units/ml IFNŒ≥, or IFNŒ≥ plus LPS for 3 h. TNFŒ± also decreased PPARŒ≥1 mRNA expression albeit to a lesser extent than LPS, whereas IFNŒ≥ increased PPARŒ≥1 mRNA. Interestingly, stimulation with IFNŒ≥ plus LPS also reduced PPARŒ≥1 mRNA, suggesting that TLR4 activation overrules IFNŒ≥ signaling (supplemental Fig. S2A). Next, we investigated the role of miR-27b in TNFŒ±-mediated PPARŒ≥1 mRNA decay. TNFŒ± also induced miR-27b expression (supplemental Fig. S2B). Moreover, inhibiting miR-27b by transfecting cells with anti-miR-27b not only prevented the reduction but even allowed induction of PPARŒ≥1 mRNA (supplemental Fig. S2C), suggesting that besides miR-27b-dependent down-regulation, other regulatory mechanisms are operating. As PPARŒ≥ is well described for its anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the expression of different cytokines (12Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of miR-27b on LPS-induced expression of TNFŒ± and IL-6. Therefore we modulated miR-27b expression by either transfecting macrophages with the miR-27b mimic or anti-miR-27b. Whereas pretreating macrophages with rosiglitazone for 1 h reduced LPS-induced expression of TNFŒ± and IL-6, overexpression of miR-27b relieved rosiglitazone-mediated inhibition (Fig. 7, A and C). Inhibiting miR-27b by transfecting cells with anti-miR-27b lowered TNFŒ± and IL-6 induction upon LPS exposure in comparison to the controls (Fig. 7, B and D). Considering the anti-inflammatory potential of PPARŒ≥, its activation emerged as a strategy to attenuate acute and chronic inflammatory diseases (17Dubuquoy L. Rousseaux C. Thuru X.

J. Med. 2004; 351: 1106-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar), already entered phase III clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and phase II trials for ulcerative colitis (24Landreth G. Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2007; 4: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Lewis J.D. Lichtenstein G.R. Deren J.J. Sands B.E. Hanauer S.B. Katz J.A. Lashner B. Present D.H. Chuai S. Ellenberg J.H. Nessel L. Wu G.D. Gastroenterology. 2008; 134: 688-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Remarkably, disease progression is often accompanied by decreased PPARŒ≥ expression, with molecular mechanisms being ill-defined. For this reason we analyzed pathways decreasing PPARŒ≥ expression during the onset of inflammation. LPS, a classical pro-inflammatory stimulus time-dependently reduced PPARŒ≥1 mRNA and protein amounts in macrophages, which is in line with the work of Necela et al. (22Necela B.M. Su W. Thompson E.A. Immunology. 2008; 125: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showing a reduction of PPARŒ≥ mRNA in murine RAW264.7 macrophages. Prolonged LPS exposure allowed to recover PPARŒ≥ mRNA to almost basal levels after 24 h. Accordingly, treating macrophages with LPS for 24 h (27Mendes Sdos S. Candi A. Vansteenbrugge M. Pignon M.R. Bult H. Boudjeltia K.Z. Munaut C. Raes M. Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 1109-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or LPS and interferon Œ≥ for 15 h even provoked PPARŒ≥ transactivation (13Von Knethen A. Br√ºne B. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Investigating PPARŒ≥ promoter activity, we ruled out transcriptional regulation. In fact, reduced promoter 1 activity appears to be negligible because this transcript variant was only minimally expressed in fully differentiated macrophages. Moreover, a minor reduction of promoter 3 activity after 6 h of LPS exposure unlikely accounts for a 90% decrease of mRNA. Therefore, we determined PPARŒ≥1 mRNA stability. Experiments with the transcription inhibitor DRB implied PPARŒ≥1 mRNA destabilization upon LPS exposure. This contrasts the work of Necela et al. (22Necela B.M. Su W. Thompson E.A. Immunology. 2008; 125: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) who observed no effect of LPS on mRNA stability using actinomycin D to block transcription. Using actinomycin D we observed similar results. This could result from effects of actinomycin D on mRNA stability by inducing translocalization of ARE-binding proteins (28Sengupta S. Jang B.C. Wu M.T. Paik J.H. Furneaux H. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25227-25233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which is a major regulatory event for activation of several ARE-binding proteins such as HuR, AUF-1 or tristetraprolin (29Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 30Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 31Taylor G.A. Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 140-146PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, previous studies revealed that actinomycin D and DRB can differently affect estimation of mRNA half-lives (32Harrold S. Genovese C. Kobrin B. Morrison S.L. Milcarek C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The use of 3‚Ä≤-UTR reporter constructs is an established method to verify potential destabilization mechanisms. Luciferase assays with a pGL3-PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR construct demonstrated the importance of the PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR, because LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity. In silico analysis showed several ARE 1 (AUUUA) and ARE 4 (12-mer A/U, max. one mismatch) sites (33Sharova L.V. Sharov A.A. Nedorezov T. Piao Y. Shaik N. Ko M.S. DNA Res. 2009; 16: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) as well as a potential miR-27a/b binding site. Deletion or mutation of the miR-27 site within the PPARŒ≥-3‚Ä≤-UTR reporter construct substantiated a miR-27b-dependent mRNA decay. In line, we observed a 2.3-fold increase of miR-27b in response to LPS, which is comparable to the induction of miR-146a after 2 h of LPS exposure in THP-1 cells (6Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12481-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (3476) Google Scholar). In addition, mRNA from mouse lung extracts showed an increased miR-27a and -b expression 3 h after LPS exposure (34Moschos S.A. Williams A.E. Perry M.M. Birrell M.A. Belvisi M.G. Lindsay M.A. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the role of miR-27a/b during inflammation in macrophages remained obscure. Several diseases are associated with dysregulated miRNA expression. miR-146a and miR-155 have been implicated in the development of rheumatoid arthritis, likely by regulating components of the inflammatory response (35Stanczyk J. Pedrioli D.M. Brentano F. Sanchez-Pernaute O. Kolling C. Gay R.E. Detmar M. Gay S. Kyburz D. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 36Nakasa T. Miyaki S. Okubo A. Hashimoto M. Nishida K. Ochi M. Asahara H. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 1284-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). These miRNAs are induced upon NFŒ∫B transactivation (6Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12481-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (3476) Google Scholar, 37Tili E. Michaille J.J. Cimino A. Costinean S. Dumitru C.D. Adair B. Fabbri M. Alder H. Liu C.G. Calin G.A. Croce C.M. J.

We also observed that induction of miR-27b is at least partially NFŒ∫B-dependent. Inhibition of NFŒ∫B with Bay11‚Äì7082 abrogated LPS-mediated PPARŒ≥1 mRNA decay, which is corroborated by the work of Necela et al. (22Necela B.M. Su W. Thompson E.A. Immunology. 2008; 125: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In their studies several NFŒ∫B inhibitors prevented the LPS-induced PPARŒ≥ decrease, although detailed mechanism remained unclear. We conclude that the NFŒ∫B-dependent PPARŒ≥1 mRNA decrease results at least in part from the NFŒ∫B-dependent induction of miR-27b upon LPS exposure. Inhibition of miR-27b prevented PPARŒ≥1 mRNA decay and thus, points to mRNA destabilization rather than translational control by miR-27b. The potential of miR-27 to decrease PPARŒ≥ mRNA is acknowledged by Lin et al. During adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells microarray analysis revealed a reduced expression of miR-27a and -b, which was correlated with an increase of PPARŒ≥. In line with our observations, transfection of these cells with miR-27a and -b reduced PPARŒ≥ mRNA (39Lin Q. Gao Z. Alarcon R.M. Ye J. Yun Z. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2348-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Moreover, Karbiener et al. (40Karbiener M. Fischer C. Nowitsch S. Opriessnig P. Papak C. Ailhaud G. Dani C. Amri E.Z. Scheideler M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 390: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that miR-27b abundance decreased during adipogenesis of human adipose-derived stem cells, suggesting anti-adipogenic effects of miR-27b because of suppression of PPARŒ≥. Taking into consideration that LPS further decreased PPARŒ≥1 mRNA despite its reduction by miR-27b overexpression suggests additional regulatory mechanisms likely by an ARE-binding protein. Moreover, as a 2-fold induction of miR-27b reduced PPARŒ≥1 mRNA to a lower extent than LPS but overexpression of miR-27b did not alter mRNA stability, points to additional regulatory mechanisms. Nevertheless, abrogating a luciferase decrease upon LPS by deletion of the miR-27 binding side or mutation of the seed region revealed that miR-27b is a prerequisite for LPS-induced PPARŒ≥ mRNA destabilization. Because PPARŒ≥ was also reduced upon TLR1/2 and 5 activation (6Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12481-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (3476) Google Scholar), in response to TNFŒ± (41Zhou M. Wu R. Dong W. Jacob A. Wang P. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 4948-4955Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we suggest that inflammatory signals in general provoke a mRNA decay. This assumption is supported by the notion that NFŒ∫B, a major inflammatory transcription factor, is involved. In line, stimulation with TNFŒ± reduced PPARŒ≥1 levels likely by miR-27b induction, while IFNŒ≥ (not activating NFŒ∫B) rather induced PPARŒ≥1 expression. Interestingly, several inflammatory diseases are not only associated with impaired PPARŒ≥ expression but also NFŒ∫B activation. Patients with multiple sclerosis exhibit enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFŒ± and show an impaired PPARŒ≥ expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (42Klotz L.

https://openalex.org/W2024249948,"E1 enzymes activate ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins in two steps by carboxy-terminal adenylation and thioester bond formation to a conserved catalytic cysteine in the E1 Cys domain. The structural basis for these intermediates remains unknown. Here we report crystal structures for human SUMO E1 in complex with SUMO adenylate and tetrahedral intermediate analogues at 2.45 and 2.6 A, respectively. These structures show that side chain contacts to ATP.Mg are released after adenylation to facilitate a 130 degree rotation of the Cys domain during thioester bond formation that is accompanied by remodelling of key structural elements including the helix that contains the E1 catalytic cysteine, the crossover and re-entry loops, and refolding of two helices that are required for adenylation. These changes displace side chains required for adenylation with side chains required for thioester bond formation. Mutational and biochemical analyses indicate these mechanisms are conserved in other E1s."

https://openalex.org/W2009409915,"Local adaptations within species are often governed by several interacting genes scattered throughout the genome. Single-locus models of selection cannot explain the maintenance of such complex variation because recombination separates co-adapted alleles. Here we report a previously unrecognized type of intraspecific multi-locus genetic variation that has been maintained over a vast period. The galactose (GAL) utilization gene network of Saccharomyces kudriavzevii, a relative of brewer‚Äôs yeast, exists in two distinct states: a functional gene network in Portuguese strains and, in Japanese strains, a non-functional gene network of allelic pseudogenes. Genome sequencing of all available S. kudriavzevii strains revealed that none of the functional GAL genes were acquired from other species. Rather, these polymorphisms have been maintained for nearly the entire history of the species, despite more recent gene flow genome-wide. Experimental evidence suggests that inactivation of the GAL3 and GAL80 regulatory genes facilitated the origin and long-term maintenance of the two gene network states. This striking example of a balanced unlinked gene network polymorphism introduces a remarkable type of intraspecific variation that may be widespread. A previously unknown type of genetic variation has been found in a study of the budding yeast Saccharomyces kudriavzevii, a close relative of brewer's yeast S. cerevisiae. Key features of the galactose (GAL) utilization gene network are preserved among most Saccharomyces species, but the type strain of S. kudriavzevii has no functional GAL genes and is unable to use galactose as a carbon source. This new study focuses on the difference between S. kudriavzevii isolates from Japan, unable to use galactose, and Portuguese isolates that can use the sugar. Genome analysis reveals highly degenerated, non-functional GAL pseudogenes in Japanese strains and functional GAL genes in Portuguese strains. The two alternative states ‚Äî termed a balanced unlinked gene network or BuGNP ‚Äî appear to be of ancient origin, coexisting in S. kudriavzevii for its entire history as a species. Local adaptations are often governed by several interacting genes scattered throughout the genome. Here a novel type of multi‚Äìlocus genetic variation is described that has been maintained within a species over a vast period of time. A balanced unlinked gene network polymorphism is dissected that involves galactose utilization in a close relative of baker's yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1997029264,"DNA polymerase zeta (Polzeta) is an error-prone DNA polymerase involved in translesion DNA synthesis. Polzeta consists of two subunits: the catalytic REV3, which belongs to B family DNA polymerase, and the noncatalytic REV7. REV7 also interacts with REV1 polymerase, which is an error-prone Y family DNA polymerase and is also involved in translesion DNA synthesis. Cells deficient in one of the three REV proteins and those deficient in all three proteins show similar phenotype, indicating the functional collaboration of the three REV proteins. REV7 interacts with both REV3 and REV1 polymerases, but the structure of REV7 or REV3, as well as the structural and functional basis of the REV1-REV7 and REV3-REV7 interactions, remains unknown. Here we show the first crystal structure of human REV7 in complex with a fragment of human REV3 polymerase (residues 1847-1898) and reveal the mechanism underlying REV7-REV3 interaction. The structure indicates that the interaction between REV7 and REV3 creates a structural interface for REV1 binding. Furthermore, we show that the REV7-mediated interactions are responsible for DNA damage tolerance. Our results highlight the function of REV7 as an adapter protein to recruit Polzeta to a lesion site. REV7 is alternatively called MAD2B or MAD2L2 and also involved in various cellular functions such as signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. Our results will provide a general structural basis for understanding the REV7 interaction."

We showed previously that Mnt1 and Mnt2 are involved in O-linked mannosylation and are required for virulence. Here, the role of C. albicans MNT3, MNT4, and MNT5 was determined by generating single and multiple MnTŒî null mutants and by functional complementation experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CaMnt3, CaMnt4, and CaMnt5 did not participate in O-linked mannosylation, but CaMnt3 and CaMnt5 had redundant activities in phosphomannosylation and were responsible for attachment of approximately half of the phosphomannan attached to N-linked mannans. CaMnt4 and CaMnt5 participated in N-mannan branching. Deletion of CaMNT3, CaMNT4, and CaMNT5 affected the growth rate and virulence of C. albicans, affected the recognition of the yeast by human monocytes and cytokine stimulation, and led to increased cell wall chitin content and exposure of Œ≤-glucan at the cell wall surface.

Therefore, the MNT1/KRE2 gene family participates in three types of protein mannosylation in C. albicans, and these modifications play vital roles in fungal cell wall structure and cell surface recognition by the innate immune system. The human pathogen Candida albicans is the most frequent cause of systemic candidosis, which is a common, life-threatening infection in immunocompromised patients (1Pappas P.G. Rex J.H. Lee J. Hamill R.J. Larsen R.A. Powderly W. Kauffman C.A. Hyslop N. Mangino J.E. Chapman S. Horowitz H.W. Edwards J.E. Dismukes W.E. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 37: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The C. albicans cell wall is a robust yet dynamic structure that protects the cell from changes in the extracellular environment. It is the immediate contact point with host cells and contains antigenic determinants, glycoproteins involved in the adhesion to host tissues, and most of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are recognized by host immune system (2Netea M.G. Brown G.D. Kullberg B.J. Gow N.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The wall is organized in an inner skeletal layer comprising chitin, Œ≤1,3- and Œ≤1,6-glucans, and an outer layer that is dominated by highly glycosylated proteins (3Klis F.M. de Groot P. Hellingwerf K. Med. Mycol. 2001; 39: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are post-translationally modified with N- and/or O-linked mannans, both of which can be further elaborated with oligomannosides that are attached via phosphodiester linkages (phosphomannans). Mannans have important roles in cell wall integrity, adhesion to host cells and tissues, virulence, and the establishment of a response by immune cells (2Netea M.G. Brown G.D. Kullberg B.J. Gow N.A.

Mannan biosynthesis has been carefully characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the main features of the pathways involved in the construction of these oligosaccharides are conserved in C. albicans. However, N- and O-linked mannans of C. albicans and S. cerevisiae have different characteristics that are relevant to immune recognition. For example, the N-linked mannan outer chain from C. albicans is usually of higher molecular weight, has a lower Œ±1,3-mannose content, and contains Œ≤1,2-mannose residues in both the acid-labile (phosphomannan) and acid-stable fractions (14Shibata N.

Additionally, C. albicans O-linked mannans do not have Œ±1,3-mannose caps and are homopolymers of five or more Œ±1,2-mannose residues (8Munro C.A. Bates S. Buurman E.T. Hughes H.B. Maccallum D.M.

The mannosyltransferases involved in glycosylation are usually encoded by gene families, and these have demonstrated a wide range of expansion and contraction in copy number between species (17Butler G. Rasmussen M.D. Lin M.F. Santos M.A. Sakthikumar S. Munro C.A. Rheinbay E. Grabherr M. Forche A. Reedy J.L. Agrafioti I. Arnaud M.B. Bates S. Brown A.J. Brunke S. Costanzo M.C.

Because C. albicans is a significant human pathogen, the study of glycosylation pathways in this organism is important in understanding the biological properties conferred by different glycan moieties in relation to cell wall function, virulence, and immune sensing. Moreover, many fungal Golgi-located mannosyltransferases are not present in mammalian cells; hence, the study of these proteins might identify new antifungal drug targets and novel routes to immunotherapy. The S. cerevisiae KRE2/MNT1 gene family is composed of nine members that encode Golgi Mn2+-dependent mannosyltransferases. With exception of Ktr6, they all catalyze the transfer of Œ±-mannose residues from a GDP-Man donor to a mannoside acceptor (18Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Bussey H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that Kre2/Mnt1, Ktr1, and Ktr3 are Œ±1,2-mannosyltransferases involved in the addition of the second and third mannose residues to the O-linked mannan and in the proper elaboration of the N-linked mannan outer chain (19Lussier M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15527-15531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas YUR1 and KTR2 encode mannosyltransferases only involved in N-linked mannosylation (20Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Camirand A. Bussey H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11001-11008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In terms of enzyme activity, Ktr6/Mnn6 is the most diverse member of this family, because it is the main enzyme involved in the phosphomannosylation of both O- and N-liked mannans (21Wang X.H.

It is predicted that the rest of the family members Ktr4, Ktr5, and Ktr7 are mannosyltransferases, but no firm role has been assigned for these enzymes in protein glycosylation. The homologous KRE2/MNT1 gene family in C. albicans has five members (23Buurman E.T. Westwater C. Hube B. Brown A.J. Odds F.C. Gow N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To establish the role of C. albicans MNT3, MNT4, and MNT5 in the glycobiology of this fungus, we characterized single and multiple mntŒî null mutants and performed functional complementation analyses of these genes in glycosylation mutants of S. cerevisiae. Our results indicate that none of these transferases are involved in the biosynthesis of O-linked mannan, but CaMnt4 and CaMnt5 have redundant functions in the elaboration of the N-mannan outer chain, and CaMNT3 and CaMNT5 encode enzymes with redundant phosphomannosyltransferase activity.

The data are given as the means ¬± S.D. The tests were conducted with six female, immunocompetent BALB/c mice/group (Harlan Sera-Lab Ltd, Loughborough, UK) as described (10Mora-Montes H.M. Bates S. Netea M.G. D√≠az-Jim√©nez D.F. L√≥pez-Romero E. Zinker S. Ponce-Noyola P. Kullberg B.J. Brown A.J. Odds F.C. Flores-Carre√≥n A. Gow N.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 2184-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The 1137-bp CaMNT3 open reading frame (GenBankTM/EBI accession Y13642), the 1443-bp CaMNT4 open reading frame (GenBankTM accession AJ277170), and the CaMNT5 1440-bp open reading frame (GenBankTM/EBI accession XM_707827) are predicted to be the orthologs of ScKTR1, ScKTR4, and ScKTR2, respectively. CaMnt3 and CaMnt4 have characteristic type II membrane protein domain structures with single transmembrane regions of 22 and 21 amino acids at their N termini, respectively, preceded by short cytosolic tails. CaMnt5 is predicted to be a multipass membrane protein, with an N-terminal tail of 29 amino acids into the lumen of the Golgi complex, a 21-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic loop of 19 residues that is followed by a second transmembrane domain of 21 amino acids. CaMnt3 and CaMnt5 include the YNLCHFWSNFEI sequence found in most of the products encoded by the yeast KRE2/MNT1 family members, and CaMnt1, which has been proposed to contain the active site nucleophile (18Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Bussey H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Like ScKtr4, CaMnt4 has a modified signature sequence (366YSTCHFWSNFEI377). They also contain the Glu, Asp, and His residues required for the nucleophilic reaction and Mn2+ binding capacity (24Thomson L.M. Bates S. Yamazaki S. Arisawa M. Aoki Y. Gow N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18933-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The CaMNT3, CaMNT4, and CaMNT5 genes were initially disrupted in strain CAI4 by sequential gene replacement using the Ura-blaster protocol (26Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional redundancy was expected because of the significant degree of homology between these genes, hence double and triple null mutants were also constructed using the mini-Ura-blaster strategy (27Wilson R.B. Davis D. Enloe B.M. Mitchell A.P. Yeast. 2000; 16: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The triple Camnt3-Camnt4-Camnt5Œî null mutant was used as background in which a quintuple Camnt1-Camnt2-Camnt3-Camnt4-Camnt5Œî null mutant was generated by then disrupting CaMNT1-CaMNT2 genes in a further step. To avoid problems associated with ectopic expression of URA3, such as growth delay and virulence defects (30Brand A. MacCallum D.M. Brown A.J. Gow N.A. Odds F.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the resulting null mutants were all transformed with plasmid CIp10 (31Murad A.M. Lee P.R. Broadbent I.D. Barelle C.J. Brown A.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 325-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reintroducing URA3 at the neutral RSP1 locus. Reintegrant control strains were generated by transformation of the null strains with CaMNT3, CaMNT4, or CaMNT5, again integrated at the RPS1 locus and under the control of their own promoters. In many of the phenotypes examined (see below) reintegration of CaMNT5 was best able to complement alterations observed in double and triple null mutant strains. For all of the experiments, strain CAI4 transformed with CIp10 was used as wild type control. The strains generated and used in this work are listed in supplemental Table 1S. The Camnt3Œî, Camnt4Œî, and Camnt5Œî single null mutants and the Camnt3-Camnt4Œî, and Camnt4-Camnt5Œî double null strains had duplication times similar to wild type cells (1.42 ¬± 0.1 h) in YPD medium at 30 ¬∞C. The Camnt3-Camnt5Œî double null mutant displayed a slight defect in the doubling time (1.71 ¬± 0.3 h), which was restored upon complementation with either CaMNT3 or CaMNT5 (duplication times were 1.53 ¬± 0.2 and 1.55 ¬± 0.1 h, respectively). The Camnt3-Camnt4-Camnt5Œî triple null mutant had an increased duplication time of 2.34 ¬± 0.2 h. Reintegration of CaMNT3 or CaMNT4 partially restored the duplication time (1.84 ¬± 0.2 and 2.0 ¬± 0.1 h, respectively), whereas complementation with CaMNT5 restored it to wild type levels (1.45 ¬± 0.3 h). The growth defect of the Camnt1-Camnt2-Camnt3-Camnt4-Camnt5Œî quintuple null mutant was similar to that showed by the triple null mutant, with a duplication time of 2.28 ¬± 0.3 h. Only the triple and quintuple null mutants displayed defects in cellular morphologies, forming small aggregates, and some yeast cells were swollen. Complementation of the triple null strain with either CaMNT3 or CaMNT4 partially attenuated the clumpy phenotype, whereas cells complemented with CaMNT5 had normal cell morphology. The colony morphology of all the null mutants analyzed was similar to that displayed by wild type cells. The single and double null mutants had normal filamentation in 20% (v/v) serum and on solid Spider medium, whereas the Camnt3-Camnt4-Camnt5Œî triple null mutant had normal hypha formation in serum but delayed filamentation on solid Spider medium. In all cases the reintegrant strains showed similar phenotypes to the wild type controls. The phenotypes observed in multiple mnt, but not single, mnt mutants therefore suggest some redundancy of Mnt function. The five members of the C. albicans MNT1 gene family have over 55% similarity to ScKTR6, the S. cerevisiae mannosylphosphate transferase involved in the addition of phosphomannan to the N- and O-linked mannan (21Wang X.H. Nakayama K. Shimma Y. Tanaka A. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18117-18124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Nakayama K. Feng Y. Tanaka A. Jigami Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1425: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether members of the MNT1 gene family were involved in phosphomannan elaboration in C. albicans by functional complementation of a S. cerevisiae ktr6Œî null mutant. In these experiments the CaMNT genes were placed under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. Transformants were assessed for their ability to bind the cationic AB that binds to the phosphate group of phosphomannan. Complementation of Scktr6Œî with CaMNT1 and CaMNT2 only partially restored AB binding, whereas CaMNT3, CaMNT4, and CaMNT5 fully complemented the ktr6Œî null mutant (Fig. 1A). Cells growing in noninductive conditions also bound more AB than the null mutant cells, and reverse transcription-PCR assays confirmed that some transcription of CaMNT genes did occur in cells growing in presence of glucose, a negative regulator of the GAL1 promoter. Single mnt null mutants and the Camnt3-Camnt4Œî and Camnt4-Camnt5Œî double null mutants were not affected in AB binding; however, the Camnt3-Camnt5Œî double null mutant and the triple mutant lacking CaMNT3, CaMNT4, and CaMNT5 had a 50% reduction in AB binding (Fig. 1B). The Camnt3-Camnt5Œî double null mutant was partially and fully complemented by reintegration of CaMNT3 and CaMNT5, respectively, and CaMNT3 and CaMNT5, but not CaMNT4, partially restored AB binding in the Camnt3-Camnt4-Camnt5Œî triple null mutant (Fig. 1B). The quintuple Camnt1-Camnt2-Camnt3-Camnt4-Camnt5Œî null mutant displayed a slight reduction in the ability to bind AB, compared with the triple Camnt3-Camnt4-Camnt5Œî null mutant, and reintegration of CaMNT1 and CaMNT2 genes restored AB binding to that of the triple null mutant (Fig. 1B). When the AB binding assay was conducted using Œ≤-eliminated cells to remove O-linked glycans, most of the strains bound less AB (‚àº22 Œºg less AB/A600 nm bound; Fig. 1B), indicating the presence of a minor phosphomannan fraction attached to O-linked mannan. Binding of AB in mutants already depleted in O-mannan such as the Camnt1-Camnt2Œî and the quintuple null mutant was much less affected by Œ≤-elimination (Fig. 1B). Therefore, CaMNT3 and CaMNT5 are involved in phosphomannosylation of C. albicans N-linked mannan but not of O-mannan. The effect of disruption of CaMNT3, CaMNT4, and CaMNT5 on the N-linked mannan structure was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays of secreted HexNAcase as a molecular marker (9Bates S. Hughes H.B. Munro C.A. Thomas W.P. MacCallum D.M. Bertram G. Atrih A. Ferguson M.A. Brown A.J. Odds F.C. Gow N.A. J. Biol.

The HexNAcase from single null mutants and Camnt3-Camnt4Œî and Camnt3-Camnt5Œî null mutants had an electrophoretic mobility similar to that in wild type cells (supplemental Fig. S1). The double Camnt4-Camnt5Œî and triple Camnt3-Camnt4-Camnt5Œî null mutants generated protein with increased electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2A). CaMNT5 was the only gene able to partially restore the phenotype of both the double Camnt4-Camnt5Œî and the triple Camnt3-Camnt4-Camnt5Œî null mutant (Fig. 2A). Deglycosylated HexNAcase from all of the strains showed the same electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that CaMNT4 and CaMNT5 are required for the N-linked mannosylation, and the role of CaMnt5 is epistatic over CaMnt4. O-Linked mannans were labeled with d-[2-3H]mannose, Œ≤-eliminated and separated by thin layer chromatograp"

https://openalex.org/W2058668243,"In mammals, excess energy is stored in the form of triacylglycerol primarily in lipid droplets of white adipose tissue. The first step of lipolysis (i.e. the mobilization of fat stores) is catalyzed by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). The enzymatic activity of ATGL is strongly enhanced by CGI-58 (comparative gene identification-58), and the loss of either ATGL or CGI-58 function causes systemic triglyceride accumulation in humans and mice. However, the mechanism by which CGI-58 stimulates ATGL activity is unknown. To gain insight into CGI-58 function using structural features of the protein, we generated a three-dimensional homology model based on sequence similarity with other proteins. Interestingly, the model of CGI-58 revealed that the N terminus forms an extension of the otherwise compact structure of the protein. This N-terminal region (amino acids 1-30) harbors a lipophilic tryptophan-rich stretch, which affects the localization of the protein. (1)H NMR experiments revealed strong interaction between the N-terminal peptide and dodecylphosphocholine micelles as a lipid droplet-mimicking system. A role for this N-terminal region of CGI-58 in lipid droplet binding was further strengthened by localization studies in cultured cells. Although wild-type CGI-58 localizes to the lipid droplet, the N-terminally truncated fragments of CGI-58 are dispersed in the cytoplasm. Moreover, CGI-58 lacking the N-terminal extension loses the ability to stimulate ATGL, implying that the ability of CGI-58 to activate ATGL is linked to correct localization. In summary, our study shows that the N-terminal, Trp-rich region of CGI-58 is essential for correct localization and ATGL-activating function of CGI-58."
https://openalex.org/W2012241820,"The members of group III hybrid histidine kinases (HHK) are ubiquitous in fungi. Group III HHK have been implicated to function as osmosensors in the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway that is essential for fungal survival under high osmolarity stress. Recent literature suggests that group III HHK are also involved in conidia formation, virulence in several filamentous fungi, and are an excellent molecular target for antifungal agents. Thus, group III HHK constitute a very important group of sensor kinases. Structurally, group III HHK are distinct from Sln1p, the osmosensing HHK that regulates the HOG pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Group III HHK lack any transmembrane domain and typically contain HAMP domain repeats at the N terminus. Until now, it is not clear how group III HHK function as an osmosensor to regulate the HOG pathway. To investigate this, we undertook molecular characterization of DhNIK1, an ortholog from osmotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii. We show here that DhNIK1 could complement sln1 mutation in S. cerevisiae thereby confirming its role as a bona fide osmosensor. We further investigated the role of HAMP domains by deleting them systematically. Our results clearly indicate that the HAMP4 domain is crucial for osmosensing by DhNik1p. Most importantly, we also show that the alternative interaction among the HAMP domains regulates the activity of DhNik1p like an ""on-off switch"" and thus provides, for the first time, an insight into the molecular mechanism of osmosensing by this group of HHKs."
https://openalex.org/W1969571623,"Arabidopsis thaliana sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 1 complexes belong to the SNF1/AMPK/SnRK1 protein kinase family that shares an ancestral function as central regulators of metabolism. In A. thaliana, the products of AtSnAK1 and AtSnAK2, orthologous to yeast genes, have been shown to autophosphorylate and to phosphorylate/activate the AtSnRK1.1 catalytic subunit on Thr(175). The phosphorylation of these kinases has been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and tandem mass spectrometry. The autophosphorylation site of AtSnAK2 was identified as Thr(154), and it was shown to be required for AtSnAK catalytic activity. Interestingly, activated AtSnRK1 exerted a negative feedback phosphorylation on AtSnAK2 at Ser(261) (Ser(260) of AtSnAK1) that was dependent on AtSnAK autophosphorylation. The dynamics of these reciprocal phosphorylation events on the different kinases was established, and structural modeling allowed clarification of the topography of the AtSnAK phosphorylation sites. A mechanism is proposed to explain the observed changes in the enzymatic properties of each kinase triggered by these phosphorylation events."

Although an increase of the peripheral IP-10 level is known in HBV-infected patients, the molecular basis of HBV infection inducing IP-10 expression has remained elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that hepatitis B virus protein X (HBx) increases IP-10 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Transfection of the HBx-expressing vector into HepG2 cells results in nuclear translocation of NF-Œ∫B, which directly binds the promoter of IP-10 at positions from ‚àí122 to ‚àí113, thus facilitating transcription. The addition of the NF-Œ∫B inhibitor blocks the effect of HBx on IP-10 induction. In parallel, increase of NF-Œ∫B subunits p65 and p50 in HepG2 cells also augments IP-10 expression. Furthermore, we show that HBx induces activation of NF-Œ∫B through the TRAF2/TAK1 signaling pathway, leading to up-regulation of IP-10 expression. As a consequence, up-regulation of IP-10 may mediate the migration of peripheral blood leukocytes in a NF-Œ∫B-dependent manner.

Although there is no direct cytopathic effect on hepatocytes, HBV infection induces the infiltration of immune cells, leading to formation of necroinflammatory foci, thus mediating disease processes (1Chisari F.V.

Chemokines are a family of small chemotactic cytokines that contain between two and four highly conserved NH2-terminal cysteine amino acid residues. They function to recruit and activate immune cells to inflammatory sites through binding to a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (4Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). IFN-Œ≥ inducible protein 10 (IP-10, CXCL10) is a CXC chemokine that can be secreted by hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelium in the liver of hepatitis patients (5Narumi S. Tominaga Y. Tamaru M.

By binding CXCR3 receptor, IP-10 exerts the chemoattracting effect on NK cells, activated T cells, and dendritic cells (7Neville L.F. Mathiak G. Bagasra O. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In IP-10‚àí/‚àí mice, immune responses to infection by neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus are reduced, concomitant with decreased CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte trafficking to the brain and reduced production of inflammatory factors (8Dufour J.H. Dziejman M. Liu M.T. Leung J.H. Lane T.E. Luster A.D. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3195-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). In HBV transgenic mice, the blockade of IP-10 significantly decreases migration of mononuclear cells and the severity of liver lesions induced by HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (9Kakimi K.

Interestingly, mRNA and protein levels of IP-10 in PBMCs, sinusoidal endothelium, and plasma are all increased in patients with chronic hepatitis B (10Wang J. Zhao J.H. Wang P.P. Xiang G.J. Hepatobiliary Pancreat. Dis. Int. 2008; 7: 45-50PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the induction of IP-10 is an important event for development of hepatitis B. However, the molecular basis of how IP-10 is regulated for induction and function exertion still remains elusive so far. The above analysis indicates that induction of IP-10 in hepatitis B patients may play an important role in driving leukocyte migration and causing the development of the immune-mediated injury. However, to date, the mechanism of how HBV induces IP-10 expression still remains elusive. It is known that the HBV genome encodes DNA polymerase, surface antigen (HBs), core protein (HBc), and nonstructural regulatory protein HBx (11Robinson W.S. Clayton D.A. Greenman R.L. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 384-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, HBx is a pleiotropic protein involved in viral replication, signal transduction, and HBV-mediated carcinogenesis (12Kekul√© A.S. Lauer U. Weiss L. Luber B. Hofschneider P.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 742-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 13Diao J. Garces R. Richardson C.D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). HBx is located at either the cytosol or the nucleus. The former may activate the signal transduction cascade, whereas the latter activates specific transcription factors (14Doria M. Klein N. Lucito R. Schneider R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4747-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). HBx does not bind DNA directly but transactivates multiple transcription factors including AP1 (15Benn J. Su F. Doria M.

Among them, NF-Œ∫B has gained much attention due to its pivotal role in regulating an exceptionally large number of genes, particularly those involved in immune and inflammatory responses (21Ghosh S.

In this study, we hypothesize that HBx regulates expression of IP-10 through the NF-Œ∫B pathway. Our data show that the HBx protein increases IP-10 expression by promoting binding of NF-Œ∫B on the Œ∫B1 binding site of the 5‚Ä≤-untranslated region of IP-10 in a dose-dependent manner. The activation of NF-Œ∫B by HBx involves signal molecules TRAF2 and TAK1, thus leading to up-regulation of IP-10 expression. In turn, up-regulation of IP-10 mediates migration of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). These findings provide new insight into the regulatory mechanism of leukocyte recruitment and infiltration to the HBV infection site. Twelve patients (8 male, 4 female; age range 32‚Äì65 years, average 48 ¬± 9) with chronic hepatitis B who underwent surgery or cancer treatment were selected from the Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College for IP-10 detection in liver tissues by real time PCR and immunohistochemistry. These patients were positive for HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBc, and HBV-specific DNA in serum. Other causes of chronic liver disease had been excluded by clinical and laboratory assessments. Seven patients with non-HBV infection that underwent surgery for cancer treatment were also selected. Five normal non-HBV-infected control liver tissues were obtained from a macroscopically normal area during liver hemangioma resection. Human hepatocellular cell lines HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 (expressing the whole HBV proteins persistently) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 ¬∞C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The HBx-expressing HepG2 cell line, transfected with the pCMV-HBx plasmid and that stably expressed the HBx protein, was cultured with 500 Œºg/ml of G418 and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 ¬∞C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Total RNA of fresh tissue samples was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized as described previously (29Park S.R. Lee J.H. Kim P.H. Eur. J.

Equal amounts of cDNA were submitted to PCR in the presence of the SYBR-PCR Master mix kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and real time PCR detection machine Mx3000PTM (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). IP-10 specific primers were as follows: forward primer, 5‚Ä≤-GCCTCTCCCATCACTTCCCTAC-3‚Ä≤; reverse primer, 5‚Ä≤-GAAGCAGGGTCAGAACATCCAC-3‚Ä≤. The housekeeping gene GAPDH was used as an internal control. Immunohistochemical staining was described previously (30Kim S.J. Rabbani Z.N. Dewhirst M.W. Vujaskovic Z. Vollmer R.T. Schreiber E.G. Oosterwijk E. Kelley M.J. Lung Cancer. 2005; 49: 325-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In brief, after deparaffinization and hydration, the slides were treated with endogenous peroxidase in 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min. Then, the sections were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 1.5% blocking serum. Sections were incubated with anti-IP-10 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight at 4 ¬∞C. Labeled horseradish peroxidase was applied for 30 min at room temperature, followed by application of diaminobenzidine solution until color developed. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. The results were observed under a light microscope. A 1050-bp IP-10 promoter construct, corresponding to the sequence from ‚àí953 to +97 (relative to the transcriptional start site) of the 5‚Ä≤-flanking region of the human IP-10 gene was generated from human genomic DNA using forward 5‚Ä≤-TTTGCTAGCCAGTTATCACTGTTACTAGC-3‚Ä≤, and reverse 5‚Ä≤-AAACTCGAGGGCAGCAAATCAGAATGGCA-3‚Ä≤ primers. Using the (‚àí953/+97) IP-10 construct as a template, several deletion constructs of the IP-10 promoter, including ‚àí534/+97, ‚àí239/+97, ‚àí191/+97, and ‚àí97/+97 were similarly generated by the corresponding forward primers: 5‚Ä≤-TTTGCTAGCACTTGCCAGTTCCAGATCTT-3‚Ä≤, 5‚Ä≤-TTTGCTAGCGAAACAGTTCATGTTTTGGAA-3‚Ä≤, 5‚Ä≤-TTTGCTAGCAAAAGAGGAGCAGAGGGAAAT-3‚Ä≤, and 5‚Ä≤-TTTGCTAGCGGTTTTGCTAAGTCAACTGTAA-3‚Ä≤. Point mutations in two NF-Œ∫B sites, NF-Œ∫B1 and NF-Œ∫B2, were generated in the (‚àí534/+97) IP-10 construct using standard site-directed mutagenesis procedures. For NF-Œ∫B1, a mutant reverse primer 5‚Ä≤-GTTCCTGGtGAAGTCaCATGTTGCAGAC-3‚Ä≤ was annealed in combination with the previously described forward primer and subjected to PCR amplification. Meanwhile, a mutant forward primer 5‚Ä≤-GCAACATGtGACTTCaCCAGGAACAGCC-3‚Ä≤ was annealed in combination with the previously described reverse primer and PCR amplification. The amplified product was gel purified and ligated into pGL3-Basic vector. A point mutant construct for NF-Œ∫B2 was generated by the same strategy with mutated primers 5‚Ä≤-GGAGCAGAGtGAAATTaCGTAACTTGGA-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-CAAGTTACGtAATTTCaCTCTGCTCCTC-3‚Ä≤. All constructs were sequenced for success. Vectors containing individual viral structural genes of HBV and NF-Œ∫B subunits were kindly provided by Dr. Wen-Jie Huang (State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China). The pNF-Œ∫B-Luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing four copies of the binding sequence of NF-Œ∫B and firefly luciferase gene was used in NF-Œ∫B activity detection. A series of double-stranded small interfering RNA targeting HBs, HBc, and HBx protein of HBV had been cloned into a siRNA-expressing vector pGenesil-1. The validity and efficiency of these siRNA plasmids were identified by determining the mRNA and protein levels of the corresponding target gene after transfecting them or mock vector into HepG2.2.15 cells. For the assay, cells were plated at a density of 1 √ó 105 cell/well in a 24-well plate. After 24 h, cells were transfected 0.8 Œºg of siRNA plasmids per well or mock vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HBx-expressing HepG2 cells were plated at a density of 5 √ó 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate. TRAF2 siRNA or TAK1 siRNA (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) per well was used to knock down TRAF2 or TAK1 expression in HBx-expressing HepG2 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. HepG2 cells were plated at a density of 1 √ó 105 cell/well in a 24-well plate. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 0.8 Œºg of the full-length gene of HBV (pBlue-HBV), different HBV protein expressing plasmids, and p50 or p65 expressing plasmids, respectively. For the luciferase assay, cells were co-transfected with 0.6 Œºg of expression vector plasmids, 0.18 Œºg of promoter reporter plasmids, and 0.02 Œºg of the pRL-TK plasmids. 5 h later, cells were washed and allowed to recover in fresh medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. 48 h later, luciferase activity was detected with the Dual Luciferase¬Æ Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative luciferase activity was determined by a ModulusTM Laboratory Luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale CA), and transfection efficiency was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (31Takenaka M. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29379-29381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from HepG2 cell-transfected relative expression vector plasmids. Biotin end-labeled oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed to obtain double-stranded DNA fragments. The oligonucleotide sequences of NF-Œ∫B1 were as follows: 5‚Ä≤-CATGGGACTTCCCCAGGAACAGC-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-GCTGTTCCTGGGGAAGTCCCATG-3‚Ä≤. EMSA was performed using the LightShift¬Æ Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the binding reactions were performed in 20-Œºl samples containing 1 Œºl of biotin-labeled oligonucleotides, 4 mg of nuclear extracts, 2 mg of poly(dI-dC), 2 Œºl of 10√ó binding buffer, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, samples were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels with 0.5√ó TBE buffer and transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) at 380 mA (‚àº100 V) for 15 min. A chemiluminescent detection of membranes was scanned by Image Station 4000R (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Specificity of the protein-DNA interaction was confirmed by competition with 20- or 100-fold of unlabeled probes of the same sequence, or the NF-Œ∫B1 mutated probes: 5‚Ä≤-CATGtGACTTCaCCAGGAACAGC-3‚Ä≤. ChIP assays were carried out using a commercial ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Billerica, MA). Briefly, HepG2 cells transfected with relative plasmids were cross-linked to histones of DNA using 1% formaldehyde at 37 ¬∞C for 10 min. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were scraped into a conical tube and sonicated to shear the chromatins. The sonicated chromatins were incubated with anti-p65 antibody, anti-p50 antibody, or an isotype control IgG for 2 h. The chromatin-antibody complex was precipitated with protein A-agarose beads. The DNA isolated from the complex was subject to PCR amplification using the following primers flanking the NF-Œ∫B1 site in IP-10 promoter: 5‚Ä≤-AACTTGGAGGCTACAATAAA-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-GAGGAATGTCTCAGAAAACG-3‚Ä≤. HepG2 cells were cultured on coverslips at a density of 5 √ó 104 cells/coverslip. After transfecting the relative plasmids for 48 h, cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, and probed for 90 min at room temperature with anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz). After probing, the signal was visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody (Sigma). Nuclei were stained using 4‚Ä≤,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Micrographs were acquired with a BX51 system equipped with DP70 (Olympus, Japan). The amounts of IP-10 present in culture supernatants were determined using a specific rat anti-human IP-10 ELISA kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) according the manufacturer's instructions. Total proteins, nuclear proteins, and cytoplasmic proteins were prepared as previously described (32Kim Y. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27686-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), separated by stacking gel and SDS-PAGE with a Tris glycine system at 100 V for 1 h, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. Then the membranes were incubated with specific anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-phospho-TAK1 (Thr184) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA), or p-IKKŒ± (Thr23) antibody (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 ¬∞C. The membranes were washed three times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by ECL Western blotting substrate (Themo Pierce, Rockford, IL). Migratory activity was quantified using 24-well Transwell inserts (5-Œºm pore size, Costar, Bethesda, MD). PBLs (1 √ó 105) in 200 Œºl of RPMI medium were added to the upper chamber. 1-ml of culture supernatant from the cells transfected with the relative plasmids was added to the lower chamber. To investigate the role of IP-10 in cell migration, 10 Œºg of neutralizing anti-IP-10 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) isotype-matched control antibody was added 30 min prior to the migration assay. Supernatants of HepG2 cells transfected with pCMV-HBx following treated with the NF-Œ∫B inhibitor SN-50 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were also investigated. The chambers were incubated for 4 h at 37 ¬∞C in 5% CO2, then the Transwell inserts were removed and migration cells were hematoxylin and eosin stained and counted. Data were expressed as mean ¬± S.D. of three determinations. Statistical analysis data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 13.0). Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test, with p < 0.05 being considered significant. The up-regulation of IP-10 expression has been reported in the PBMCs, plasma, and liver of patients with chronic hepatitis B (10Wang J. Zhao J.H. Wang P.P. Xiang G.J. Hepatobiliary Pancreat. Dis. Int. 2008; 7: 45-50PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the previous report, we analyzed the expression of IP-10 in HBV-infected liver tissue, and found that the mRNA levels of IP-10 were much higher in HBV-positive liver cancer tissues, compared with HBV-negative liver cancer tissues or normal liver tissues (Fig. 1A). The similar protein result was also confirmed by immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 1B). These data suggested that IP-10 is elevated in HBV-infected liver tissue, and may play an important role in HBV infection-induced hepatitis. To evaluate the effect of HBV on IP-10 expression, HepG2 cells were transfected with the full-length HBV gene (pBlue-HBV) for 48 h and protein levels of IP-10 in the supernatants were measured. As shown in Fig. 2A, IP-10 protein was significantly increased in the pBlue-HBV-transfected group relative to control. We then evaluated the effect of different HBV proteins by transfecting pCMV-HBs, pCMV-HBc, and pCMV-HBx, respectively. The result showed that transfection of HBx, rather than HBs, or HBc-expressing vector increased IP-10 protein levels (Fig. 2A). Consistently, using siRNA technology, we found that knockdown of the HBx gene significantly decreased the protein levels of IP-10 in HepG2.2.15 cells (Fig. 2B). The efficiencies of transfection and gene silencing were determined in Fig. 2, C and D. Interestingly, we found that knockdown of either the HBs or HBc genes had no effect on IP-10 expression in HepG2.2.15 cells (Fig. 2B). Together, these data suggested that HBx is a critical regulator for IP-10 expression during HBV infection. To determine whether HBx induces IP-10 gene transcription through a promoter, a human IP-10 promoter reporter plasmid containing the sequence from ‚àí953 to +97 (relative to the transcriptional start site) of the 5‚Ä≤-flanking region was co-transfected with individual HBV protein-expressing plasmids (pCMV-HBs, pCMV-HBc, or pCMV-HBx) or mock plasmid (pCMV-tag2) into HepG2 cells. The results show that the IP-10 promoter was markedly activated by the HBx protein in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, E and F). In line with this, a gradual increased level of HBx protein in HepG2 cells was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2G). Analysis using the Genomatix MatInspector program and Gene2Promoter software revealed the presence of many consensus cis-elements including GAS, ISRE, AP-1, and NF-Œ∫B binding sites on the IP-10 promoter (Fig. 3A). To investigate the role of these cis-elements in regulating IP-10 expression by the HBx protein, a series of 5‚Ä≤ deletions of the IP-10 promoter were constructed and co-transfected with pCMV-HBx, respectively, into HepG2 cells. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 3B, the deletion from nt ‚àí953 to ‚àí190 did not affect HBx-induced luciferase activity, however, deletion to nt ‚àí96 significantly decreased HBx-induced luciferase activity, suggesting that the sequence between nt ‚àí190 to ‚àí96 is critical for activation of the IP-10 promoter by the HBx protein. Coincidently, two NF-Œ∫B binding sites (NF-Œ∫B1 and NF-Œ∫B2) were found in this region, and could be the reason for IP-10 activation. Thus, we mutated these two NF-Œ∫B sites by multiple rounds of PCR, and found that only mutation of NF-Œ∫B1 but not the NF-Œ∫B2 binding site effectively reduced HBx-induced activation of the IP-10 promoter (Fig. 3C). These data suggested that the NF-Œ∫B1 binding site is required for activation of the IP-10 promoter regulated by the HBx protein. To further determine the roles of NF-Œ∫B in activation of the IP-10 promoter by the HBx protein, HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations of the NF-Œ∫B inhibitor SN50 after co-transfection with pCMV-HBx and the ‚àí953 to +97 IP-10 reporter plasmid. Results from the luciferase activity assay showed that blocking NF-Œ∫B by SN50 resulted in inhibition of the IP-10 promoter activity (Fig. 3D), suggesting that NF-Œ∫B activation is required to activate the IP-10 promoter by the HBx protein. Next, we asked whether the activated NF-Œ∫B bound to the IP-10 promoter directly. For this purpose, we performed EMSA with a probe of biotin-labeled NF-Œ∫B1 binding oligonucleotides in the IP-10 promoter (‚àí125 to ‚àí102), and found that the DNA binding activity of NF-Œ∫B was significantly increased in cells transfected with pCMV-HBx, compared with mock plasmid (Fig. 4A). To determine the specificity of the NF-Œ∫B binding activity, nuclear extracts were incubated with labeled NF-Œ∫B1 binding oligonucleotides in the presence of either an unlabeled wild type NF-Œ∫B binding probe or a mutated probe. As shown in Fig. 4A, the wild type NF-Œ∫B-binding oligonucleotides, but not the mutated oligonucleotides abrogated NF-Œ∫B complexes. Consistently, the addition of NF-Œ∫B inhibitor SN50 also inhibited the DNA binding activity of NF-Œ∫B (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that NF-Œ∫B binds to the NF-Œ∫B1 binding site in the IP-10 promoter. Using a comparable approach, we also performed a ChIP assay. Chromatin fragments were prepared from HepG2 cells transfected with pCMV-HBx and immunoprecipitated with antibody against either the p50 or p65 subunit. A 177-bp DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from DNA isolated from cells transfected with pCMV-HBx in the presence of anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibody, but they were not detected in the presence of mock plasmid or control antibody (Fig. 4B). Thus, these data suggested that NF-Œ∫B binds to the NF-Œ∫B1 binding site in the IP-10 promoter. NF-Œ∫B is composed of homo- and heterodimers, typically p65 and p50 heterodimers. After the destruction of IŒ∫B, NF-Œ∫B is capable of translocating into the nucleus and transactivates target genes (33Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of the HBx protein on translocation of p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus after transfecting pCMV-HBx into HepG2 cells. Nuclear translocation of p65 was defined by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5A, transfection with pCMV-HBx, but not the pCMV-tag, caused a remarkable translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-Œ∫B from the cytosol to the nucleus. In addition, we also tested the HBV-transfected HepG2.2.15 cell line. A similar result was observed; and knockdown of HBx expression by transfecting the siRNA impaired p65 translocation (data not shown). Moreover, at 0, 24, and 48 h post-transfection of pCMV-HBx, protein levels of p65 in cytosol and nucleus fractions were analyzed by Western blot using anti-p65 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5C, the levels of p65 protein decreased in the cytosol and increased in the nucleus in parallel with transfection times. However, this phenomenon was not observed in cells transfected with the pCMV-tag (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that HBx protein facilitates translocation of p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus. NF-Œ∫B is composed of homo- and heterodimers, typically p65 and p50 heterodimers. To investigate the effect of p50 and p65 subunits of NF-Œ∫B on transcriptional activation of IP-10, HepG2 cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing p65 or p50, and the protein levels of IP-10 were determined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 6A, transfection of p50 or p65 proteins increased the IP-10 protein levels, and IP-10 reached the highest level when both p50 and p65 proteins were present. Furthermore, we co-transfected HepG2 cells with plasmids expressing p65 or p50 and IP-10 (‚àí534/+97) reporter pla"

LZAP is also known as a negative regulator of cell invasion, and its expression was demonstrated to be reduced in several tumor tissues. However, the molecular mechanism of the negative effect of LZAP on cell invasion is unclear. In this study, we identify NLBP as a novel LZAP-binding protein using tandem affinity purification. We demonstrate the negative effects of NLBP on cell invasion and the NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway. NLBP expression was not detected in hepatocellular carcinoma cells with strong invasive activity, whereas its expression was detected in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line with no invasive activity. We also demonstrate that these two proteins mutually affect the stability of each other by inhibiting ubiquitination of the other protein. Based on these results, we suggest that NLBP may act as a novel tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell invasion, blocking NF-Œ∫B signaling, and increasing stability of the LZAP protein.

Multistep progressions are involved in tumor formation. Many proteins, including tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, affect the tumorigenesis of normal cells (1Hahn W.C. Weinberg R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). One of the most important factors for tumor formation is mutations in tumor suppressors or oncogenes, which affect expression levels and/or protein activity (2Wiedemann L.M. Morgan G.J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1992; 28: 248-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, maintaining oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in a wild type state is crucial to blocking tumorigenesis.

(also known as Cdk5rap3 or C53 protein) was originally identified as an ARF-binding protein and was found to have numerous functions as a tumor suppressor.

Although LZAP has been functionally shown to be a tumor suppressor, the molecular mechanism of how LZAP blocks tumorigenesis is not yet clear. To gain further insight into the molecular mechanism of LZAP functions on tumorigenesis, we performed biochemical tandem repeat affinity purification and identified KIAA0776 as a novel LZAP-binding protein (NLBP). NLBP encodes an uncharacterized protein of 794 amino acids and does not contain any conserved domains. In this study, we show that NLBP is a novel LZAP-binding protein that may function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell invasion, blocking NF-Œ∫B signaling, and increasing the stability of the LZAP protein. Human NLBP (KIAA0776), CT116, and LZAP cDNA were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Full-length and deletion mutants of human NLBP were generated by PCR and subcloned into a modified pIRES-EGFP mammalian expression vector, as described previously (8Kim H. Chen J. Yu X.

HeLa, U2OS, 293T, HepG2, Hep3B, HLE, PLC, and Huh7 cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 ¬∞C in 5% CO2 (v/v). All siRNA duplexes used in this study were purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). The sequences of LZAP siRNA1 and -2 are 5‚Ä≤-AAGGATTGGCAGGAGATTATA-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-CAAGGTATGTGGACCGAGT-3‚Ä≤, respectively. The sequences of NLBP siRNA1 and -2 are 5‚Ä≤-AGAAATGAGAGATGAGCTA-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-AGAAGAGGTCAATGATAAA-3‚Ä≤, respectively. The sequence of control siRNA is 5‚Ä≤-UUCAAUAAAUUCUUGAGGUUU-3‚Ä≤. siRNAs were transfected into cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit anti-NLBP antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with mixed peptides (649CDIMVKRGDKKRER669 and 755ELDKEQEDVASTTRK770). The resulting rabbit polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified using the SulfoLink or AminoLink Plus immobilization and purification kit (Pierce). Anti-FLAG, -hemagglutinin, -Myc, and -Œ≤-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma, and polyclonal human LZAP and p65 antibodies were purchased from Oncogene Science. Transient transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in NETN buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 100 Œºm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 Œºg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 ¬∞C for 10 min. Crude lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 ¬∞C for 5 min, and supernatants were incubated with protein A-agarose-conjugated primary antibodies. The immunocomplexes were washed three times with NETN buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using the antibodies indicated in the figure legends. The establishment of stable cell lines was previously described (11Kim H. Huang J. Chen J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 710-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To establish cell lines stably expressing epitope-tagged proteins, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding SFB-LZAP and puromycin-resistant protein. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were split at a 10:1 ratio and cultured in medium containing puromycin (10 Œºg/ml) for 3 weeks. Individual puromycin-resistant colonies were isolated and screened by Western blotting for expression of the LZAP protein. 293T cells stably expressing SFB-LZAP protein were lysed with 4 ml of NETN buffer on ice for 10 min. Crude lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 ¬∞C for 10 min, and supernatants were incubated with 300 Œºl of streptavidin-conjugated beads (Amersham Biosciences). The immunocomplexes were washed three times with NETN buffer, and bead-bound proteins were eluted with 500 Œºl of NETN buffer containing 2 mg/ml biotin (Sigma). The eluted supernatant was incubated with 60 Œºl of S-protein beads (Novagen). The immunocomplexes were washed three times with NETN buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Silver staining was performed to visualize the protein bands. Specific bands were excised and digested, and the peptides were analyzed by a mass spectrometer. The GST fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (12Hofer B. Backhaus S. Timmis K.N. Gene. 1994; 144: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Two Œºg of GST fusion protein or GST was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with lysates prepared from cells that were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteins in NETN buffer for 2 h at 4 ¬∞C. After washing with NETN buffer, the samples were analyzed by Western blotting analysis. Immunofluorescence staining was previously described (11Kim H. Huang J. Chen J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 710-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Next, the cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min and blocked with PBS containing 5% goat serum at room temperature for 30 min. The coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 20 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with one of the following secondary antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at room temperature for 20 min. 4‚Ä≤,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to counterstain the nuclei. After a final wash with PBS, coverslips were mounted with glycerin containing p-phenylenediamine. All images were obtained with a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 fluorescence microscope. The cell invasion assay was performed using 24-well Transwell permeable supports (8-Œºm pore size, Corning Life Sciences) coated with 60 Œºl (1 mg/ml) of Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Cells were starved in serum-free medium overnight, trypsinized, and washed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Twenty thousand cells in 1% fetal bovine serum-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were seeded into the upper chamber, and 600 Œºl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 or 1% fetal bovine serum was placed in the lower chamber. After a 16-h incubation, the Matrigel and cells remaining in the upper chamber were removed. Cells on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. For the quantitative assay, the cells that invaded through the Matrigel were stained with 4 Œºg/ml calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 30 min at 37 ¬∞C and scanned for fluorescence with the Victor 3 multiplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); fluorescent cells were counted. All experiments were run in duplicate and were repeated three times. U2OS cells were transfected with indicated siRNAs. Cells were plated 48 h after treatment onto 6-well plates and allowed to grow into confluent monolayers. Scrape wounds were generated using a micro tip, and cell medium was replaced. After 6 h, cells that had migrated were counted. All experiments were repeated three times. To identify new LZAP-binding proteins, we performed tandem repeat affinity purification using 293T cells stably expressing SFB-LZAP, the LZAP protein triply tagged at the N terminus with SBP (SFB tag) (Fig. 1A). After sequential affinity chromatography with streptavidin agarose and S-agarose beads and mass spectrometry analysis using the cell lysates prepared from cells expressing SFB-LZAP, we identified several putative LZAP-binding proteins (Table 1). Among these proteins, we focused on KIAA0776 (subsequently named NLBP) and CT116 (uncharacterized protein c20orf116 precursor) because peptides from these two proteins were the most abundantly recovered from the mass spectrometry analysis. First, we checked for binding between LZAP and NLBP or CT116 by overexpression in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, LZAP associated strongly with NLBP and showed weak binding to CT116. To further confirm the interaction between LZAP and NLBP, GST pulldown assays were performed using the GST protein alone or the GST-LZAP fusion protein with FLAG-NLBP-transfected 293T cell lysates. This experiment showed that the NLBP protein specifically bound to GST-LZAP but not GST alone (Fig. 1C). Physical interaction between endogenous LZAP and NLBP was also confirmed (Fig. 1D). Finally, NLBP was shown to colocalize with LZAP in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1E). These data indicate that NLBP is a bona fide LZAP-binding partner.TABLE 1List of proteins associated with SFB-LZAP identified by mass spectrometry analysisProtein nameNo. of peptides obtained per experimentLZAP48KIAA077631Uncharacterized protein c20orf116 precursor (CT116)9Œ≤-1,4-Galactosyltransferase 1 (B4GT1)6Heat shock 70-kDa protein 1-like6Heat shock 70-kDa protein 15Highly similar to Rattus norvegicus ubiquitin c (UBC)460 S acidic ribosomal protein p03Ubiquitin-fold modifier-conjugating enzyme 13Heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein2Ubiquitin fold modifier 1 precursor1Hect, uba, and wwe domain-containing protein 11Adenine nucleotide translocator 1160 S ribosomal protein I31Rpl10a protein1Transmembrane protein 55a1Nucleolar phosphoprotein b231Œ≤-1,4-Galactosyltransferase 5 (B4GT5)1Rps3 protein1 Open table in a new tab To identify the region of NLBP that interacts with LZAP, several deletion mutants of NLBP were constructed (Fig. 2A). NLBP wild type protein and deletion mutants were tested for the ability to interact with full-length LZAP by coexpression in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, NLBP amino acid residues 121‚Äì250 were found to be important for association with full-length LZAP protein. Similarly, we generated a series of LZAP deletion mutants and examined which regions of LZAP might be required for interaction with NLBP. We found that LZAP amino acid residues 301‚Äì400 are capable of binding NLBP (Fig. 3, A and B).FIGURE 3Identification of the NLBP-binding region of LZAP.

An H. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Yarbrough W.G. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 239-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether NLBP can also affect cell invasion and MMP-9 expression using NLBP or LZAP siRNA-transfected U2OS cells. We measured in vitro cell-invasive activity, either by measuring calcium uptake (Fig. 4A) or by measuring invasion through a Matrigel barrier (Fig. 4B), after LZAP or NLBP expression was decreased by siRNA transfection. Following siRNA-mediated inhibition of LZAP or NLBP expression, invasion was increased by ‚àº5-fold (Fig. 4A), and invasive activity was slightly enhanced when cotransfected with both LZAP and NLBP siRNAs (Fig. 4, A and B). Down-regulation of LZAP or NLBP expression did not affect cellular migration through the Transwell permeable supports in the absence of Matrigel (Fig. 4C). Next, we performed Western blotting analysis to check MMP-9 expression levels in control, LZAP, or NLBP siRNA-transfected U2OS cell lines. MMP-9 expression levels were increased following knockdown of LZAP or NLBP (Fig. 4D), consistent with the increase in cell-invasive activity. Our in vitro data showed that NLBP likely inhibits cell invasion and suggested the possibility that NLBP expression would be reduced in highly invasive cancer cell lines when compared with non-invasive cancer cell lines. Therefore, we checked the expression levels of NLBP and LZAP in several hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines by Western blotting with anti-NLBP or anti-LZAP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4E, expression levels of LZAP and NLBP were reduced in several invasive hepatocellular carcinomas, including HepG2, Hep3B, HLE, and PLC, but not in the non-invasive Huh7 cell line (13Masumoto A. Arao S. Otsuki M. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To identify the regions of NLBP or LZAP that are important for cell invasion, NLBP or LZAP wild type protein or serial deletion mutants were transfected into Hep3B cells and tested for their ability to affect cell invasion. As shown in Fig. 4, F and G, NLBP amino acid residues 121‚Äì250 and LZAP amino acid residues 301‚Äì400 were found to be important for inhibition of cell invasion. Because NLBP and LZAP are binding partners, we tested to see whether reducing the levels of one binding partner by siRNA treatment would affect the levels of the other protein. Using antibodies against NLBP or LZAP, we found that treatment with either or both siRNAs can efficiently down-regulate both LZAP and NLBP expression (Fig. 4H). To further verify the functional importance of the presence of both proteins in cell invasion, we overexpressed one protein in the invasive Hep3B cell line and looked at the effect of siRNA treatment of the other protein. LZAP siRNA treatment was found to restore the levels of Hep3B cell-invasive activity that had been inhibited by overexpression of NLBP (Fig. 4I). Similar results were observed for NLBP siRNA-treated LZAP overexpression cells (Fig. 4I). Decreased LZAP expression was previously shown to activate NF-Œ∫B-mediated transcription, and LZAP was found to bind to the NF-Œ∫B p65/RelA protein (7Wang J. An H. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Yarbrough W.G. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 239-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether NLBP also binds to the NF-Œ∫B p65/RelA protein. In 293T cells overexpressing the proteins, NLBP specifically bound to the NF-Œ∫B p65/RelA protein, whereas the CT116 protein did not (Fig. 5A). NF-Œ∫B-mediated transcription was also observed to increase after the reduction of LZAP or NLBP protein expression levels by LZAP or NLBP siRNA transfection (Fig. 5B). TNF-Œ± is known to activate NF-Œ∫B-mediated transcription. To test whether NLBP can also affect TNF-Œ±-induced NF-Œ∫B activation, NF-Œ∫B transcriptional activity was measured in cells transfected with the NLBP or LZAP expression plasmids after treatment with TNF-Œ±. NLBP was found to inhibit TNF-Œ±-induced NF-Œ∫B activation, similar to what had been previously described for LZAP (Fig. 5C) (7Wang J. An H. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Yarbrough W.G. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 239-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We further determined the importance of NLBP in LZAP-mediated inhibition of NF-Œ∫B activation and vice versa. Hep3B cells were transfected with the LZAP expression plasmid in the absence or presence of NLBP siRNA. Overexpressed LZAP inhibits NF-Œ∫B-mediated transcription in Hep3B cells, but NF-Œ∫B transcriptional activity is restored in the presence of NLBP siRNA (Fig. 5D). To identify the regions of NLBP or LZAP that affect NF-Œ∫B-mediated transcription, NLBP or LZAP wild type protein or serial deletion mutants were transfected into Hep3B cells and tested for their ability to affect NF-Œ∫B-mediated transcription. As shown in Fig. 5, E and F, we found that NLBP amino acid residues 121‚Äì250 and LZAP amino acid residues 301‚Äì400 are important for inhibition of NF-Œ∫B-mediated transcription. Overexpressed NLBP inhibits TNF-Œ±-induced p65/RelA nuclear translocation (Fig. 5G). The data in Fig. 4, E and H, provided us with the possibility that the NLBP and LZAP proteins mutually regulate the stability of each other. We therefore checked the effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on the expression levels of NLBP and LZAP proteins in U2OS cell lines. Expression levels of NLBP and LZAP proteins increased after treatment with MG132 (Fig. 6A), and similar results were obtained using 293T cells (data not shown). We also checked the effect of NLBP expression on the turnover of LZAP protein by measuring LZAP levels after blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX). Degradation of the LZAP protein in control siRNA-transfected cells was delayed when compared with NLBP siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6B). Moreover, overexpression of both proteins together appeared to increase the half-life of both proteins (Fig. 6C). These data are consistent with the possibility that NLBP and LZAP proteins are degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. Therefore, LZAP and NLBP were both examined for ubiquitination. The ubiquitination levels of the LZAP and NLBP proteins increased when cotransfected with an ubiquitin expression plasmid, but when the expression plasmids for both proteins were cotransfected, ubiquitination levels decreased (Fig. 6, D and F). This increase in protein stability appears to be mediated by binding between LZAP and NLBP because coexpression of LZAP with a NLBP deletion mutant lacking binding activity to LZAP did not influence ubiquitination levels of LZAP (Fig. 6D), and similar results were obtained when NLBP was coexpressed with a LZAP deletion mutant lacking NLBP binding activity (Fig. 6F). In this study, we identified NLBP as a novel LZAP-binding protein using the tandem repeat affinity purification method. We confirmed the physical association between NLBP and LZAP by overexpression in 293T cells and also at endogenous levels. Similar to LZAP, knockdown of NLBP expression increased MMP-9 expression and cell invasion but did not affect cell migration. NLBP was found to function as a negative regulator of NF-Œ∫B-mediated transcription, also similar to LZAP. In addition, NLBP and LZAP expression was reduced in certain hepatocellular carcinomas that have highly invasive activity. These data strongly suggest that NLBP may function as a tumor suppressor together with LZAP through inhibition of cell invasion and NF-Œ∫B-mediated transcription. Several studies have shown that LZAP localized to different subcellular compartments, including the nucleus, nucleolus, or cytoplasm (3Jiang H. Luo S. Li H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20651-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Jiang H. Wu J. He C. Yang W. Li H. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6Wang J. He X. Luo Y. Yarbrough W.G. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Wang J. An H. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Yarbrough W.G. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 239-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, our data show that NLBP protein colocalizes with LZAP in the cytoplasm. These data suggest that the cytoplasm may be the compartment where the NLBP and LZAP proteins function together. Here, we show that NLBP or LZAP expression inhibits cell invasion and NF-Œ∫B activation in Hep3B cells, which have high invasive activity and low expression levels of both the NLBP and the LZAP proteins. The inhibition of cell invasion and NF-Œ∫B activation seen upon overexpression of NLBP or LZAP was restored upon LZAP or NLBP siRNA treatment, respectively. Furthermore, deletion mutants of LZAP or NLBP, which lack the region binding to the other protein, could not inhibit cell-invasive activity or NF-Œ∫B activation in Hep3B cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that the interaction between LZAP and NLBP is required for tumor suppression through inhibition of cell invasion and NF-Œ∫B activation. We speculate that the effects of NLBP and LZAP on cell invasion and MMP-9 expression may be mediated by effects on the NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway. The Matrigel chamber model that we used to quantify invasive activity reflects an early step of metastasis where tumor cells invade basement membranes. Data from our Matrigel assays and the reduced expression levels of NLBP and LZAP observed in non-invasive tumor cell lines lead us to conclude that the NLBP-LZAP complex is a potent regulator that inhibits local invasion of cells in the early steps of metastasis. The expression levels of the NLBP and LZAP proteins increased after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 6A), and the half-life of each protein increased in the presence of the other protein (Fig. 6, B and C). In addition, the levels of the ubiquitinated forms of these proteins were reduced when both protein expression plasmids were cotransfected, whereas binding region deletion mutants did not reduce the levels of the ubiquitinated form of the other protein (Fig. 6, D and F). These results suggest that binding between these two proteins is required for mutual stabilization. Because these two proteins are ubiquitinated in vivo (Fig. 6, D and F), we reason that one or more ubiquitin E3 ligase proteins may ubiquitinate these proteins and may have a major role in the interplay between LZAP and NLBP. The identification of the E3 ligase(s) and the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between LZAP and NLBP remain to be determined. LZAP was previously shown to have reduced expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (7Wang J. An H. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Yarbrough W.G. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 239-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and many reports show that the 6q16.1 locus, where the NLBP gene is located, was deleted in several tumor tissues (14Kasahara K.

These data provide additional conviction that NLBP may be a bona fide new tumor suppressor protein and may also imply that the loss of the NLBP gene is initiating events leading to the loss of LZAP. Because overexpression of NLBP can efficiently block cell invasion, the activation or supply of NLBP may be a useful mode of therapy to inhibit the cell invasion of tumors with non-functional NLBP. In conclusion, the identification of NLBP, a new LZAP-binding protein, provides new implications for the interplay between signaling pathways and protein networks in tumor development.

https://openalex.org/W2089648205,"NASP (nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein) is a member of the N1/N2 family, which is widely conserved among eukaryotes. Human NASP reportedly prefers to bind to histones H3¬∑H4 and the linker histone H1, as compared with H2A¬∑H2B, and is anticipated to function as an H3¬∑H4 chaperone for nucleosome assembly. However, the direct nucleosome assembly activity of human NASP has not been reported so far. In humans, two spliced isoforms, somatic and testicular NASPs (sNASP and tNASP, respectively) were identified. In the present study we purified human sNASP and found that sNASP efficiently promoted the assembly of nucleosomes containing the conventional H3.1, H3.2, H3.3, or centromere-specific CENP-A. On the other hand, sNASP inefficiently promoted nucleosome assembly with H3T, a testis-specific H3 variant. Mutational analyses revealed that the Met-71 residue of H3T is responsible for this inefficient nucleosome formation by sNASP. Tetrasomes, composed of the H3¬∑H4 tetramer and DNA without H2A¬∑H2B, were efficiently formed by the sNASP-mediated nucleosome-assembly reaction. A deletion analysis of sNASP revealed that the central region, amino acid residues 26‚Äì325, of sNASP is responsible for nucleosome assembly in vitro. These experiments are the first demonstration that human NASP directly promotes nucleosome assembly and provide compelling evidence that sNASP is a bona fide histone chaperone for H3¬∑H4.

These experiments are the first demonstration that human NASP directly promotes nucleosome assembly and provide compelling evidence that sNASP is a bona fide histone chaperone for H3¬∑H4. The nucleosome is the fundamental unit of eukaryotic chromatin and is composed of a 146-base pair DNA and a histone octamer (1Luger K. M√§der A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6927) Google Scholar). The histone octamer comprises two H2A¬∑H2B dimers and one H3¬∑H4 tetramer (2Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). During the nucleosome assembly process, an H3¬∑H4 tetramer is first deposited into chromatin, and H2A¬∑H2B dimers are then incorporated into the H3¬∑H4 tetrasome to form a complete octameric nucleosome. These nucleosome assembly processes are mediated by the histone chaperones, which directly bind to H2A¬∑H2B and/or H3¬∑H4 in cells (3Akey C.W. Luger K. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In mammals, NASP (nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein) was found to share a high degree of sequence similarity with the N1/N2 family. In mice, disruption of the NASP gene caused early embryonic lethality (46Richardson R.T. Alekseev O.M. Grossman G. Widgren E.E. Thresher R. Wagner E.J. Sullivan K.D. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J.

In addition, tNASP and sNASP were found as subunits in the large histone-chaperone complex containing CAF1, HIRA, ASF1, and H3¬∑H4 (26Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y.

EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting their function in nucleosome assembly. However, direct nucleosome-assembly activity, which may be a common property among the H3¬∑H4 chaperones, has not been reported for the human NASPs so far, although sNASP preferentially binds to H3¬∑H4 over H2A¬∑H2B (52Wang H. Walsh S.T. Parthun M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5763-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study, we purified human sNASP as a recombinant protein and found that sNASP itself promotes nucleosome assembly in vitro. sNASP promotes the assembly of nucleosomes containing human H3 variants, H3.1, H3.2, H3.3, and CENP-A, but not H3T, with different efficiencies. The differences in the sNASP-mediated nucleosome-assembly efficiency among the H3 variants found in the present study may provide important insights into the sNASP function in chromatin organization and dynamics. Human sNASP and its deletion mutants were overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells as N-terminal hexahistidine (His6)-tagged proteins. The DNA fragments encoding sNASP were ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET15b vector (Novagen), which harbors the His6 tag and the thrombin protease recognition sequence (GE Healthcare) at the N terminus. Freshly transformed E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells, which also carried an expression vector for the minor tRNAs (Codon(+)RIL; Stratagene), were grown on LB plates containing ampicillin (100 Œºg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 Œºg/ml) at 37 ¬∞C. After a 16-h incubation, 5‚Äì20 colonies on the LB plates were collected and inoculated into LB medium (5 liters) containing ampicillin (100 Œºg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 Œºg/ml), and the cultures were incubated at 30 ¬∞C. When the cell density reached an A600 = 0.4, 1 mm isopropyl-Œ≤-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce the expression of sNASP, and the cultures were further incubated at 18 ¬∞C for 12 h. The cells producing sNASP were harvested, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 m NaCl, and disrupted by sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (27,216 √ó g; 20 min), and the lysate was mixed gently with 4 ml (50% slurry) of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose resin (Qiagen) at 4 ¬∞C for 1 h. The sNASP-bound Ni-NTA beads were then packed into an Econo-column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole at a flow rate of about 0.8 ml/min. His6-tagged sNASP was eluted by a 100-ml linear gradient of imidazole from 5 to 500 mm in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol and 500 mm NaCl. The His6 tag was removed from the sNASP portion by thrombin protease (3 units/mg of protein). The sample was immediately dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After removing the His6 tag, sNASP was purified using a Mono Q (GE Healthcare) column by elution with a 30-ml linear gradient of 100‚Äì600 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The peak Mono Q fractions were collected, and the protein was further purified by using a Superdex 200 column eluted with 1.2 column volumes of the same buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. After this step, sNASP was again purified and concentrated by Mono Q chromatography by elution with a 30-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 100 to 600 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The sNASP deletion mutants were prepared by the same procedure as the full-length sNASP. The purified sNASP and sNASP deletion mutants were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Human H2A, H2B, H4, and all H3 variants (H3.1, H3.2, H3.3, H3T, and CENP-A) were overexpressed in E. coli cells as N-terminal His6-tagged proteins (53Tanaka Y. Tawaramoto-Sasanuma M. Kawaguchi S. Ohta T. Yoda K. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Methods. 2004; 33: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). During the protein purification, the His6 tag was removed from the histones, and the H2A¬∑H2B and H3¬∑H4 complexes were prepared by the method described previously (10Tachiwana H. Osakabe A. Kimura H. Kurumizaka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2208-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Human Nap1 (hNap1) was overexpressed in E. coli cells as an N-terminal His6-tagged protein and was purified by a four-step purification method, including the Ni-NTA column, the His6 tag removal, the heparin-Sepharose column, and the Mono Q column, as described previously (10Tachiwana H. Osakabe A. Kimura H. Kurumizaka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2208-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A 195-bp DNA fragment containing the Lytechinus variegates 5 S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified by PCR using following primers: 5 S rDNA forward (5‚Ä≤-CAACGAATAACTTCCAGGGATTTATAAGCCG-3‚Ä≤; 5 S rDNA reverse (5‚Ä≤- AATTCGGTATTCCCAGGCGGTCTCC-3‚Ä≤). After the PCR reaction, the DNA fragment was extracted by phenol/chloroform, precipitated by ethanol, and further purified by Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography to remove the primers and dNTPs. H2A¬∑H2B (8 ng/Œºl) and H3.1¬∑H4 (8 ng/Œºl) were preincubated with sNASP or hNap1 at 23 ¬∞C for 10 min. The nucleosome assembly reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 S rDNA (8 ng/Œºl), and the reaction was continued in 10 Œºl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 80 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT at 23 ¬∞C for 60 min. After the reaction, the samples were incubated at 42 ¬∞C for 60 min to eliminate nonspecific DNA binding by the histones and then were analyzed by 6% PAGE in 0.2 √ó TBE buffer (18 mm Tris base, 18 mm boric acid, and 0.4 mm EDTA). The gel was run at 6.25 V/cm for 3 h and stained with ethidium bromide. After the nucleosome assembly reaction with sNASP or hNap1, each sample, containing 40 ng of 5 S rDNA, was treated with 0.8, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, and 0 unit of MNase (Takara) in 10 Œºl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 45 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT. After a 5-min incubation at 23 ¬∞C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 60 Œºl of a proteinase K solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science)). After a 15-min incubation at 23 ¬∞C, the DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA fragments were then analyzed by 10% PAGE in 0.2 √ó TBE buffer (21 V/cm for 1 h) and ethidium bromide staining. H2A¬∑H2B (10 ng/Œºl) and H3¬∑H4 (10 ng/Œºl) were preincubated with sNASP or hNap1 at 37 ¬∞C for 15 min. The nucleosome assembly reaction was initiated by the addition of relaxed œïX174 DNA (10 ng/Œºl), which was previously incubated with 1.7 units of wheat germ topoisomerase I (Promega) per 100 ng of DNA at 37 ¬∞C for 150 min. The reaction was continued in 10 Œºl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT at 37 ¬∞C for 60 min. After the reaction, the samples were incubated at 42 ¬∞C for 60 min to eliminate nonspecific DNA binding by the histones, and the proteins were then removed by an incubation with 60 Œºl of a proteinase K solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) at 37 ¬∞C for 15 min followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. The DNA samples were then analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 √ó TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA) (3.3 V/cm for 4 h) with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) staining. sNASP (2.4 Œºg) was mixed with H3¬∑H4 (0.75‚Äì3 Œºg) in 10 Œºl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT. The samples were then incubated for 1 h at 23 ¬∞C. After the incubation, the samples were analyzed by 6% PAGE in 0.5 √ó TBE buffer (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA). The gel was run at 10.4 V/cm for 110 min, and the bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Purified H2A¬∑H2B (492 Œºg) was mixed with H3T¬∑H4 (705 Œºg) at 4 ¬∞C in the presence of a 146-bp DNA fragment (500 Œºg) in a solution containing 0.5 m KCl (625 Œºl). The mixture was first dialyzed against 400 ml of dialysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) containing 2 m KCl for 2 h at 4 ¬∞C. The concentration of KCl was gradually reduced from 2 to 0.25 m by adding dialysis buffer containing 0.25 m KCl using a peristaltic pump (0.8 ml/min flow rate). The sample was then incubated at 55 ¬∞C for 2 h. The H3T nucleosome was purified from the free DNA and histones by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Prepcell apparatus (Bio-Rad). The nucleosomes were analyzed by 6% PAGE in 0.2 √ó TBE buffer (18 mm Tris base, 18 mm boric acid, and 0.4 mm EDTA) at 15.6 V/cm for 1 h followed by ethidium bromide staining. The histone contents were also analyzed by 18% SDS-PAGE. sNASP (2.4 Œºg) was mixed with H3.1¬∑H4 (1 Œºg) or H3T¬∑H4 (1.5 Œºg), incubated for 10 min at 23 ¬∞C, and combined with supercoiled plasmid DNA (pGSAT4; 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 ng). The samples were further incubated for 1 h and analyzed by 5% PAGE in 0.5 √ó TBE buffer (10.4 V/cm for 1.5 h) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Human sNASP reportedly binds preferentially to histones H3¬∑H4 (52Wang H. Walsh S.T. Parthun M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5763-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our proteome analysis with a HeLa cell extract also showed that human sNASP bound to histones H3¬∑H4 (data not shown). These facts suggest that sNASP may be a histone chaperone for H3¬∑H4. We then purified human sNASP as a recombinant protein (Fig. 1). Human sNASP was overexpressed in E. coli cells as an N-terminal His6-tagged protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). The molecular mass of sNASP is 49 kDa; however, it migrated more slowly on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, probably because of its extreme acidity (pI = 4.35). The His6-tagged sNASP was purified by Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography (Fig. 1A, lane 4). The His6 tag was removed from sNASP with thrombin protease (Fig. 1B). sNASP without a His6 tag migrated more slowly than His6-tagged sNASP because of the lack of the basic His6 tag (Fig. 1B). After removal of the His6 tag, sNASP was further purified by Mono Q column chromatography and Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1C). A mass spectroscopic analysis revealed that the molecular mass of purified recombinant sNASP was 49 kDa, which is identical to the predicted molecular mass of sNASP. As reported previously, purified sNASP efficiently bound to histones H3.1¬∑H4 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that sNASP may promote nucleosome assembly as the H3¬∑H4 chaperone. However, the nucleosome assembly activity of sNASP has not been reported so far, although sNASP reportedly supported the nucleosome assembly reaction in the presence of a cell extract from yeast (52Wang H. Walsh S.T. Parthun M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5763-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We then tested the nucleosome assembly activity of sNASP by the conventional nucleosome formation assay. hNap1, which is known to have robust nucleosome assembly activity, was used for positive controls. In this assay, sNASP or hNap1 was preincubated with H2A¬∑H2B and H3.1¬∑H4, and then the 195-bp 5 S rDNA was added into the reaction mixture. The nucleosome formation was analyzed by a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Intriguingly, we found that substantial amounts of nucleosomes were formed in the presence of sNASP as compared with the control experiments with hNap1 (Fig. 2B). To confirm nucleosome formation by sNASP, we next performed a MNase treatment. In this assay, the 147-bp DNA fragments, which were tightly wrapped around the histone octamer, were detected after the MNase treatment because MNase preferentially digests DNA free from the histone octamer surface. Therefore, if the nucleosomes were properly assembled, then the 147-bp DNA fragment would be detected after MNase treatment, as shown in the positive control experiments with hNap1 (Fig. 2C, lanes 7‚Äì11). As shown in Fig. 2C (lanes 12‚Äì16), the 147-bp protection from MNase was clearly detected, when the nucleosome assembly reactions were conducted with sNASP. These results strongly supported the conclusion that sNASP actually promotes the formation of nucleosomes. We next tested sNASP-mediated nucleosome assembly by a topological assay. When nucleosomes are formed on relaxed circular DNA, negative supercoils are introduced, and the superhelicity can be analyzed on an agarose gel. As shown in Fig. 3A, a progressive increase in the number of negative superhelical turns introduced into DNA was observed with increasing amounts of sNASP (lanes 9‚Äì11). The nucleosome assembly efficiency of sNASP was comparable with that of hNap1, which is known to have robust nucleosome assembly activity (Fig. 3A). Like hNap1, sNASP also promoted the formation of tetrasomes, in which the DNA is wrapped around the H3¬∑H4 tetramer without H2A¬∑H2B (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we concluded that sNASP itself possesses the nucleosome assembly activity, as an H3¬∑H4 chaperone. In humans, five non-allelic H3 variants, H3.1, H3.2, H3.3, H3T, and CENP-A, have been identified. All five H3 variants were prepared as recombinant proteins in the complex form with H4 (Fig. 4A). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that sNASP bound to all of the H3¬∑H4 complexes, although each H3¬∑H4¬∑sNASP complex migrated differently on the non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4B). Careful titration experiments revealed that sNASP binds to H3.1¬∑H4 with the highest apparent binding affinity and also efficiently binds to H3.2¬∑H4 with slightly reduced affinity, as compared with H3.1¬∑H4 (Fig. 4C). H3.3¬∑H4 exhibited the lowest apparent binding affinity to sNASP among the human H3 variants, and H3T¬∑H4 and CENP-A¬∑H4 exhibited moderate sNASP binding, which was slightly higher than that of H3.3¬∑H4 (Fig. 4C). We then tested sNASP-mediated nucleosome assembly with these H3¬∑H4 complexes containing the human H3 variants by a topological assay. As shown in Fig. 5A (lanes 3‚Äì11), sNASP exhibited comparable nucleosome assembly activity to that of hNap1 with H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3. sNASP also efficiently formed the nucleosome containing the centromere-specific H3 variant, CENP-A (Fig. 5A, lane 17). In contrast, sNASP was significantly defective in the H3T nucleosome assembly (Fig. 5A, lane 14), although it bound to H3T¬∑H4 (Fig. 4, B, lanes 16‚Äì20, and C). The amount of the H3T nucleosome formed by sNASP was below the background level (Fig. 5A, lanes 12 and 14). Consistent with our previous results, hNap1 did not promote the assembly of the H3T nucleosome (Fig. 5A, lane 13). It should be noted that hNap1 inhibited the spontaneous H3T nucleosome assembly, which was detected in the absence of histone chaperone (Fig. 5A, lane 12). On the other hand, unlike hNap1, sNASP may not inhibit the spontaneous H3T nucleosome assembly (Fig. 5A, lanes 12‚Äì14). The H3T¬∑H4 complex used in this study was perfectly competent for nucleosome formation, as assessed by salt dialysis (Fig. 5, B and C), indicating that the defective H3T nucleosome formation by sNASP and hNap1 is not due to the inability of H3T to participate in nucleosome formation. Because negative supercoils were introduced as a consequence of nucleosome formation, the longer migration distance on the gel corresponded to the higher number of nucleosomes assembled by sNASP. Careful sNASP titration experiments revealed that sNASP efficiently promoted nucleosome assembly with H3.1 and H3.2 (Fig. 5D, lanes 3‚Äì10). H3.3 was incorporated into nucleosomes by sNASP with reduced efficiency, as compared with H3.1 and H3.2 (Fig. 5D, lanes 11‚Äì14). Interestingly, sNASP robustly promoted the assembly of nucleosomes containing the centromere-specific H3, CENP-A (Fig. 5D, lanes 19‚Äì22). These specificities for the H3 variants in the sNASP-mediated nucleosome formation are almost consistent with the apparent affinity of sNASP to the H3 variants complexed with H4, except for H3T (Fig. 4C). This discrepancy with H3T may be due to the defective H3T¬∑H4 deposition onto DNA by sNASP. To test this possibility, we performed an H3¬∑H4 deposition assay (10Tachiwana H. Osakabe A. Kimura H. Kurumizaka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2208-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When the sNASP¬∑H3T¬∑H4 or sNASP¬∑H3.1¬∑H4 complex was incubated in the presence of DNA, sNASP may be released from the complex with the histones, if the histones are deposited onto DNA. As shown in Fig. 5E, sNASP was efficiently released from the complex with H3.1¬∑H4 in the presence of DNA. In contrast, sNASP was not efficiently released from the sNASP¬∑H3T¬∑H4 complex in the presence of DNA (Fig. 5E). These results support the hypothesis that sNASP binds to H3T¬∑H4, but it is defective in the H3T¬∑H4 deposition onto DNA. To identify the amino acid residue(s) responsible for the defective formation of the H3T nucleosome by sNASP, we prepared the H3¬∑H4 complexes containing the H3.1 mutants, H3.1(A24V), H3.1(V71M), H3.1(A98S), and H3.1(A111V), in which each H3.1 residue, Ala-24, Val-71, Ala-98, or Ala-111, was replaced by the corresponding amino acid residue of H3T (Fig. 6A). We then tested these H3.1 mutants for the sNASP-mediated nucleosome formation. When the H3.1(V71M) mutant was used for the experiment, the sNASP-mediated nucleosome formation was significantly decreased and resembled that of H3T (Fig. 6B). In contrast, sNASP efficiently promoted nucleosome formation with the H3.1(A24V), H3.1(A98S), and H3.1(A111V) mutants (Fig. 6B). A reciprocal experiment with the H3T(M71V) mutant (Fig. 6A) confirmed that the M71V mutation of H3T significantly improved the efficiency of the sNASP-mediated formation of the H3T nucleosome (Fig. 6C). Therefore, we conclude that the Met-71 residue of H3T is responsible for the defective incorporation of H3T into nucleosomes by sNASP. To identify the functional domain of sNASP responsible for the nucleosome assembly activity, we designed 10 sNASP fragments (Fig. 7A). These sNASP fragments contained amino acid residues 1‚Äì225, 226‚Äì449, 1‚Äì275, 1‚Äì325, 1‚Äì375, 1‚Äì425, 26‚Äì325, 51‚Äì325, 76‚Äì325, and 151‚Äì325. We purified these sNASP fragments by the same method, including the His6-tag removal step, as the full-length sNASP purification (Fig. 7B). We then tested the nucleosome assembly activity by a topological assay. As shown in Fig. 7C, significant nucleosome assembly activity was detected with the 1‚Äì325, 1‚Äì375, 1‚Äì425, and 26‚Äì325 fragments, but the 1‚Äì225, 226‚Äì449, 1‚Äì275, 51‚Äì325, 76‚Äì325, and 151‚Äì325 fragments were defective in the nucleosome assembly. Therefore, the region of amino acids 26‚Äì325 contains the nucleosome assembly domain of sNASP. In mammalian cells, two spliced forms of NASP, tNASP and sNASP, were identified (47Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). tNASP is highly expressed in testis, suggesting its function during spermatogenesis. On the other hand, sNASP is ubiquitously found in somatic cells. Several studies suggested that the NASP proteins may be chaperones specific for the linker histone H1 (46Richardson R.T. Alekseev O.M.

J. 2008; 95: 1314-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, significant sequence similarity has been found between sNASP and the N1/N2 family of proteins, whose members are histone H3¬∑H4-specific chaperones. Parthun and co-workers (52Wang H. Walsh S.T. Parthun M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5763-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) elegantly showed that sNASP preferentially binds to both histones H1 and H3¬∑H4 in vitro and in vivo. This finding suggests that sNASP may function as a chaperone for both the linker histone H1 and core histones H3¬∑H4. However, the H3¬∑H4 chaperone activity of sNASP alone was not reported so far, although sNASP reportedly supported nucleosome assembly in the presence of a yeast cytosolic extract (52Wang H. Walsh S.T. Parthun M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5763-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The requirement of the yeast cytosolic extract in this sNASP-dependent nucleosome formation implied that sNASP may not be able to generate stable nucleosomes by itself (52Wang H. Walsh S.T. Parthun M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5763-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether sNASP indirectly deposits histones onto DNA through other factors that directly assemble nucleosomes or whether sNASP is more directly involved in histone deposition remains to be determined. In the present study we found that (i) sNASP itself promotes nucleosome assembly with four core histones, (ii) sNASP promotes tetrasome assembly with H3¬∑H4 in the absence of H2A¬∑H2B, and (iii) sNASP mediates nucleosome assembly with the human histone H3 variants, H3.1, H3.2, H3.3, and CENP-A, but not with H3T, with different efficiencies. (iv) The Val-71 residue, which is not conserved in H3T, is essential for the sNASP-mediated nucleosome assembly. In addition, we found that (v) the central region, amino acid residues 26‚Äì325, of sNASP is responsible for the nucleosome assembly in vitro. These new results provide a compelling answer for the previously unsolved question of whether sNASP is able to directly promote nucleosome assembly. Therefore, we conclude that sNASP may function as a bona fide histone chaperone for H3¬∑H4, in addition to the linker histone H1. It should be noted that the purified sNASP used in this study lacked the His6 tag, whereas the sNASP used in the previous biochemical analysis (52Wang H. Walsh S.T. Parthun M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5763-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) contained the His6 tag. This difference between the sNASP preparations may have caused the difference in the nucleosome assembly activity, although other experimental differences, such as the composition of the reaction mixtures, may also have contributed. sNASP is an extremely acidic protein (pI = 4.35). The addition of the basic His6 tag to the sNASP sequence may affect the nucleosome assembly activity of sNASP because the binding of sNASP to the basic histones could largely depend on its extreme acidity. A yeast factor(s), which complements the negative effect of the His6 tag, may be required to detect the nucleosome assembly activity of the His6-tagged sNASP protein. In the present study we found that sNASP is inefficient in the nucleosome assembly with a testis-specific histone variant, H3T. Previously, we reported that a conventional histone chaperone, hNap1, is defective in nucleosome assembly with H3T and that the Val-111 residue of H3T is responsible for the defective H3T nucleosome assembly by hNap1 (10Tachiwana H. Osakabe A. Kimura H. Kurumizaka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2208-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results suggest that both sNASP and hNap1 discriminate H3T from other histone H3 variants. However, interestingly, our mutational analyses revealed that sNASP and hNap1 require different amino acid residues, Met-71 and Val-111, respectively, for the H3T discrimination. This difference may reflect variations in the nucleosome assembly mechanisms between sNASP and hNap1. Structural analyses of sNASP and hNap1 complexed with H3¬∑H4 are awaited to address this issue. Intriguingly, an Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of sNASP, Sim3, was found to be important for S. pombe CENP-A localization at the centromere region of chromosomes (54Dunleavy E.M. Pidoux A.L.

This suggested that sNASP may also function in the formation of the centromere-specific nucleosome containing CENP-A. Sim3 reportedly interacted with non-chromosomal CENP-A (54Dunleavy E.M. Pidoux A.L. Monet M. Bonilla C. Richardson W. Hamilton G.L. Ekwall K. McLaughlin P.J. Allshire R.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 1029-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); however, human NASPs were found only in the cytosolic H3 complex (26Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G.

EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that sNASP binds to the human CENP-A¬∑H4 complex and promotes the assembly of the CENP-A nucleosome in vitro. Interestingly, CENP-A was one of the efficient substrates for nucleosome assembly by sNASP. These findings support the idea that sNASP may function as a chaperone for the centromere-specific nucleosome formation. A histone chaperone, HJURP, for the CENP-A nucleosome, has been identified in humans (41Dunleavy E.M. Roche D. Tagami H. Lacoste N. Ray-Gallet D. Nakamura Y. Daigo Y. Nakatani Y.

Given that sNASP, like HJURP, functions as a CENP-A chaperone, it would be intriguing to determine how these two CENP-A chaperones participate in the formation of the centromere-specific chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1992432457,"TRPC4 and TRPC5 are two closely related members of the mammalian transient receptor potential cation channel family that have been implicated in important physiological functions, such as growth cone guidance and smooth muscle contraction. To further unravel the role of TRPC4 and TRPC5 in these processes in vivo, detailed information about the molecular composition of native channel complexes and their association with cellular signaling networks is needed. We therefore searched a human aortic cDNA library for novel TRPC4-interacting proteins using a modified yeast two-hybrid assay. This screen identified SESTD1, a previously uncharacterized protein containing a lipid-binding SEC14-like domain as well as spectrin-type cytoskeleton interaction domains. SESTD1 was found to associate with TRPC4 and TRPC5 via the channel's calmodulin- and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-binding domain. In functional studies, we demonstrate that SESTD1 binds several phospholipid species in vitro and is essential for efficient receptor-mediated activation of TRPC5. Notably, phospholipid binding to SESTD1 was Ca(2+)-dependent. Because TRPC4 and -5 conduct Ca(2+), SESTD1-channel signaling may be bidirectional and also couple TRPC activity to lipid signaling through SESTD1. The modulation of TRPC channel function by specific lipid-binding proteins, such as SESTD1, adds another facet to the complex regulation of these channels complementary to the previously described effects of direct channel-phospholipid interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2001556518,"The leukocyte common antigen, CD45, is a critical immune regulator whose activity is modulated by cytoskeletal interactions. Components of the spectrin-ankyrin cytoskeleton have been implicated in the trafficking and signaling of CD45. We have examined the lateral mobility of CD45 in resting and activated T lymphocytes using single-particle tracking and found that the receptor has decreased mobility caused by increased cytoskeletal contacts in activated cells. Experiments with cells that have disrupted betaI spectrin interactions show decreased cytoskeletal contacts in resting cells and attenuation of receptor immobilization in activated cells. Applying two types of population analyses to single-particle tracking trajectories, we find good agreement between the diffusion coefficients obtained using either a mean squared displacement analysis or a hidden Markov model analysis. Hidden Markov model analysis also reveals the rate of association and dissociation of CD45-cytoskeleton contacts, demonstrating the importance of this analysis for measuring cytoskeleton binding events in live cells. Our findings are consistent with a model in which multiple cytoskeletal contacts, including those with spectrin and ankyrin, participate in the regulation of CD45 lateral mobility. These interactions are a major factor in CD45 immobilization in activated cells. Furthermore, cellular activation leads to CD45 immobilization by reduction of the CD45-cytoskeleton dissociation rate. Short peptides that mimic spectrin repeat domains alter the association rate of CD45 to the cytoskeleton and cause an apparent decrease in dissociation rates. We propose a model for CD45-cytoskeleton interactions and conclude that the spectrin-ankyrin-actin network is an essential determinant of immunoreceptor mobility."
https://openalex.org/W2158404209,"Hantaviruses, members of the Bunyaviridae family, are emerging category A pathogens that carry three negative stranded RNA molecules as their genome. Hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) is encoded by the smallest S segment genomic RNA (viral RNA). N specifically binds mRNA caps and requires four nucleotides adjacent to the cap for high affinity binding. We show that the N peptide has distinct cap- and RNA-binding sites that independently interact with mRNA cap and viral genomic RNA, respectively. In addition, N can simultaneously bind with both mRNA cap and vRNA. N undergoes distinct conformational changes after binding with either mRNA cap or vRNA or both mRNA cap and vRNA simultaneously. Hantavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) uses a capped RNA primer for transcription initiation. The capped RNA primer is generated from host cell mRNA by the cap-snatching mechanism and is supposed to anneal with the 3' terminus of vRNA template during transcription initiation by single G-C base pairing. We show that the capped RNA primer binds at the cap-binding site and induces a conformational change in N. The conformationally altered N with a capped primer loaded at the cap-binding site specifically binds the conserved 3' nine nucleotides of vRNA and assists the bound primer to anneal at the 3' terminus. We suggest that the cap-binding site of N, in conjunction with RdRp, plays a key role during the transcription and replication initiation of vRNA genome."
https://openalex.org/W2115062176,"The DNA mismatch repair protein MutS acts as a molecular switch. It toggles between ADP and ATP states and is regulated by mismatched DNA. This is analogous to G-protein switches and the regulation of their ""on"" and ""off"" states by guanine exchange factors. Although GDP release in monomeric GTPases is accelerated by guanine exchange factor-induced removal of magnesium from the catalytic site, we found that release of ADP from MutS is not influenced by the metal ion in this manner. Rather, ADP release is induced by the binding of mismatched DNA at the opposite end of the protein, a long-range allosteric response resembling the mechanism of activation of heterotrimeric GTPases. Magnesium influences switching in MutS by inducing faster and tighter ATP binding, allowing rapid downstream responses. MutS mutants with decreased affinity for the metal ion are impaired in fast switching and in vivo mismatch repair. Thus, the G-proteins and MutS conceptually employ the same efficient use of the high energy cofactor: slow hydrolysis in the absence of a signal and fast conversion to the active state when required."
https://openalex.org/W2016053920,"Bacterial flagellin is important for intestinal immune homeostasis. Flagellins from most species activate Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5). The principal bacterial food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni escapes TLR5 recognition, probably due to an alternate flagellin subunit structure. We investigated the molecular basis of TLR5 evasion by aiming to reconstitute TLR5 stimulating activity in live C. jejuni. Both native glycosylated C. jejuni flagellins (FlaA and FlaB) and recombinant proteins purified from Escherichia coli failed to activate NF-kappaB in HEK293 cells expressing TLR5. Introduction of multiple defined regions from Salmonella flagellin into C. jejuni FlaA via a recombinatorial approach revealed three regions critical for the activation of human and mouse TLR5, including a beta-hairpin structure not previously implicated in TLR5 recognition. Surprisingly, this domain was not required for the activation of chicken TLR5, indicating a selective requirement for the beta-hairpin in the recognition of mammalian TLR5. Expression of the active chimeric protein in C. jejuni resulted in secreted glycosylated flagellin that induced a potent TLR5 response. Overall, our results reveal a novel structural requirement for TLR5 recognition of bacterial flagellin and exclude flagellin glycosylation as an additional mechanism of bacterial evasion of the TLR5 response."
https://openalex.org/W2003457113,"Connexin43 (Cx43) is widely expressed in embryonic brain, and its expression becomes restricted mainly to astrocytes as the central nervous system matures. Recent studies have indicated that Cx43 plays important, nonchannel, roles during central nervous system development by affecting neuronal cell migration. Here, we evaluated the effects of Cx43 on neuronal differentiation. For that we used an in vitro model of neural cell development (neurospheres) to evaluate, through immunocytochemistry, electrophysiology, and molecular biology, the degree of neuronal maturation from neurospheres derived from wild-type (WT) and Cx43-null mice. Our results indicate that Cx43 is a negative modulator of neuronal differentiation. The percent neurospheres containing differentiated neurons and the number of cells displaying inward currents were significantly higher in Cx43-null than in WT littermate neurospheres. Knockdown of Cx43 with small interfering RNA increased the number of WT neurospheres generating differentiated neurons. Blockade of gap junctional communication with carbenoxolone did not induce neuronal differentiation in WT neurospheres. Transfection of Cx43-null neurospheres with Cx43 mutants revealed that Cx43 carboxyl terminus prevents neuronal maturation. In agreement with these in vitro data, in situ analysis of embryonic day 16 brains revealed increased beta-III-tubulin expression in germinal zones of Cx43-null compared with that of WT littermates. These results indicate that Cx43, and specifically its carboxyl terminus, is crucial for signaling mechanisms preventing premature neuronal differentiation during embryonic brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2061199142,"Fap1-like serine-rich glycoproteins are conserved in streptococci, staphylococci, and lactobacilli, and are required for bacterial biofilm formation and pathogenesis. Glycosylation of Fap1 is mediated by a gene cluster flanking the <i>fap1</i> locus. The key enzymes responsible for the first step of Fap1 glycosylation are glycosyltransferases Gtf1 and Gtf2. They form a functional enzyme complex that catalyzes the transfer of <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues to the Fap1 polypeptide. However, until now nothing was known about the subsequent step in Fap1 glycosylation. Here, we show that the second step in Fap1 glycosylation is catalyzed by nucleotide-sugar synthetase-like (Nss) protein. The <i>nss</i> gene located upstream of <i>fap1</i> is also highly conserved in streptococci and lactobacilli. Nss-deficient mutants failed to catalyze the second step of Fap1 glycosylation <i>in vivo</i> in <i>Streptococcus parasanguinis</i> and in a recombinant Fap1 glycosylation system. Nss catalyzed the direct transfer of the glucosyl residue to the GlcNAc-modified Fap1 substrate <i>in vitro</i>, demonstrating that Nss is a glucosyltransferase.

https://openalex.org/W2079790469,"The classical nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway is under the control of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of IKK-1, IKK-2, and NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO). This complex is responsible for the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Dysregulation of this pathway is associated with several human diseases, and as such, its inhibition offers an exciting opportunity for therapeutic intervention. NEMO binding domain (NBD) peptides inhibit the binding of recombinant NEMO to IKK-2 in vitro. However, direct evidence of disruption of this binding by NBD peptides in biological systems has not been provided. Using a cell system, we expanded on previous observations to show that NBD peptides inhibit inflammation-induced but not basal cytokine production. We report that these peptides cause the release of IKK-2 from an IKK complex and disrupt NEMO-IKK-2 interactions in cells. We demonstrate that by interfering with NEMO-IKK-2 interactions, NBD peptides inhibit IKK-2 phosphorylation, without affecting signaling intermediates upstream of the IKK complex of the NF-kappaB pathway. Furthermore, in a cell-free system of IKK complex activation by TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6), we show that these peptides inhibit the ability of this complex to phosphorylate downstream substrates, such as p65 and inhibitor of kappaB alpha (IkappaB alpha). Thus, consistent with the notion that NEMO regulates IKK-2 catalytic activity by serving as a scaffold, appropriately positioning IKK-2 for activation by upstream kinase(s), our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which NBD peptides exert their anti-inflammatory effects in cells."

A key feature of the ability of T. gondii to infect and multiply in virtually any warm blooded animal is a complex life cycle that encompasses both sexual (sporozoite) and asexual (tachyzoite and bradyzoite) stages of development. Sexual replication occurs exclusively in felines, whereas asexual division occurs in all warm blooded hosts. Three main routes of infection exist for T. gondii. Congenital infection occurs with maternal transmission of tachyzoites via the placenta to a fetus, whereas ingestion of bradyzoites occurs when tissue cysts in undercooked meat are consumed, and finally, infection with sporozoites occurs when food or water contaminated with oocysts is consumed. A remarkable trait of T. gondii is its ability to differentiate from the ingested bradyzoite or sporozoite into the fast replicating tachyzoite, facilitating rapid dissemination throughout the host. Upon challenge by the immune system, the tachyzoite converts to the slow growing, encysted bradyzoite responsible for establishing a chronic, transmissible infection. Historically, meat containing T. gondii tissue cysts was considered the major route of transmission to humans; however, improved farming practices have considerably reduced the likelihood of infected livestock (9Tenter A.M. Heckeroth A.R. Weiss L.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 1217-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2467) Google Scholar). The prevalence of T. gondii in felines, however, remains high (10Dubey J.P. Saville W.J.

Shedding of T. gondii oocysts containing infectious sporozoites by both feral and domestic cats continues to result in widespread environmental contamination, due both to large numbers of parasites shed (as many as 1 million/cat) and to the resistance of oocysts to environmental degradation (15Dubey J.P. Vet. Parasitol. 2004; 126: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Localized incidences of water-borne transmission as well as substantial outbreaks due to contaminated water supplies or soil have been extensively documented (16Bahia-Oliveira L.M. Jones J.L.

Due to the potentially broad scale of an outbreak, environmental transmission of T. gondii through sporozoite ingestion arguably poses the most significant global risk. Stage conversion in T. gondii coincides with a major change in expression of surface antigens belonging to the surface antigen 1 (SAG1) 4The abbreviations used are: SAGsurface antigen glycoproteinSRSSAG-related sequenceGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolSporoSAGmajor sporozoite surface antigen glycoprotein. -related sequences (SRS) family, which are predicted to play a dual role in parasite attachment and regulation of host immunity to establish chronic infection (22Carruthers V.

Structural requisites of this superfamily are an N-terminal secretion signal, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and a complement of conserved amino acids that typically include six cysteines per SRS monomer that participate in three disulfide bonds. Sequencing of the T. gondii genome has revealed more than 160 SRS family members (27Jung C. Lee C.Y. Grigg M.E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies of the predominantly tachyzoite-expressed SAG1 and bradyzoite-expressed BSR4 identified a topologically defined groove that is postulated to coordinate host cell surface molecules such as heparin (25He X.L.

Although SAG1 and BSR4 show differential expression patterns, they are both members of the SAG1 family, which are phylogenetically divergent from the SAG2 family of SRS antigens (27Jung C. Lee C.Y. Grigg M.E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, paralogs within the SAG2 family share less identity (‚àº20%) when compared with the SAG1 family (‚àº30%). Members of the SAG2 family also differ in terms of open reading frame size, with the smaller SAG2A and SAG2B proteins consisting of a single SAG domain, whereas SAG2C and SporoSAG contain two SAG domains interrupted by a single intron. Despite the increased divergence of the SAG2 family relative to the SAG1 family, it is the SAG2 family that is more conserved across other tissue-dwelling coccidia (27Jung C. Lee C.Y. Grigg M.E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To date, only two structural descriptions have been reported for the 160+ SRS superfamily: one for the tachyzoite-expressed SAG1 (25He X.L. Grigg M.E. Boothroyd J.C. Garcia K.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 606-611PubMed Google Scholar) and the second for the bradyzoite-expressed BSR4 (28Crawford J. Grujic O. Bruic E. Czjzek M. Grigg M.E. Boulanger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9192-9198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine the structural and functional implications of a sporozoite-expressed SRS protein, we report the 1.60 √Ö resolution crystal structure and immunoreactivity profile of the major GPI-tethered cell surface antigen expressed in sporozoites. The characterization of SporoSAG also provides the first structural view of a T. gondii SRS family member from the infectious sporozoite stage and from the SAG2 subfamily. The protein sequence alignment for phylogenetic reconstruction was constructed using the program PROMALS3D (29Pei J. Kim B.H. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The structures of SAG1 (1KZQ), BSR4 (2JKS), and SporoSAG (2WNK) were used to anchor the alignment. Besides the choice of initial sequence alignment method (PROMALS), default parameters were implemented. The resulting alignment was hand-edited in Geneious (30Drummond A.J. Kearse M. Heled J. Moir R. Thierer T. Ashton B. Wilson A. Stones-Havas S. Geneious. Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand2006Google Scholar). Due to the prevalence of indels in the sequence alignment, positions where the 50% consensus was a gap were ignored for tree building. A neighbor-joining tree was generated from a protein distance matrix, using PROTDIST and NEIGHBOR from the PHYLIP package (version 3.68) (31Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). The rate variation between sites was gamma distributed with an alpha value of 0.5. A total of 10,000 bootstraps were run, and only nodes receiving >50% support were resolved in the tree displayed. Sera from infected patients, mice, and rabbits were tested for reactivity against insect cell-produced SporoSAG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described previously by Kong et al. (32Kong J.T. Grigg M.E. Uyetake L. Parmley S. Boothroyd J.C. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 1484-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, infected patient, mouse, and rabbit sera (1:80 dilution) were incubated overnight with 0.3 Œºg of baculovirus-expressed recombinant proteins. Positive reactions were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human, anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit polyvalent IgG, IgA, and IgM detection antibodies (Sigma), developed with 2,2‚Ä≤-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.), and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm after >60 min. Serum samples from a known uninfected volunteer served as a negative control, and serum from a patient infected with Type II strain oocysts was included as the positive control, respectively. For murine and rabbit infections, positive control sera were derived by injecting bradyzoite cysts or sporulated oocysts of the Type II Me49 strain via the oral (bradyzoites, oocysts) and subcutaneous routes (oocysts). To obtain sporulated oocysts, fecal floats from cats shedding T. gondii oocysts were incubated in 2% sulfuric acid for 1 week at room temperature to allow for sporulation. Sporulated oocysts were counted, and either 100 or 1000 oocysts were fed orally or injected subcutaneously into mice or rabbits. Sera reactivity against insect cell-produced SAG1 or SRS2 was measured as the positive control for infection with Toxoplasma, and reactivity against a generic insect cell-produced protein was included as a negative control. The tandem SAG domains of SporoSAG are separated by an intervening intronic sequence therefore requiring a multistep PCR approach to generate a single cDNA template. Each domain was initially amplified separately from T. gondii RH genomic DNA (Ex1, forward, 5‚Ä≤-cagactccatgggaCCTGAAGCAACTTCCTGTG-3‚Ä≤; Ex1 (overlap), reverse, 5‚Ä≤-CACCGGAGCCTGTGGTGCCGCTTTGACGAG-3‚Ä≤; Ex2 (overlap), forward, 5‚Ä≤-AAGCGGCACCAAGGCTCCGGTGTGTTCGG-3‚Ä≤; Ex2, reverse, 5‚Ä≤-ctgtctggcggccgcAACGGTTACCAAAACTTTGCAGG-3‚Ä≤). Domain 1 and domain 2 amplicons were then combined, allowing homologous regions (underlined) to anneal and extend, resulting in a single cDNA template. This product was then amplified (Ex1 forward and Ex2 reverse) and cloned into NcoI/NotI-digested pAcGP67b (Pharmingen) in-frame with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Expression of the sequence-verified clone was conducted in the baculovirus insect cell system. Primary virus was generated by co-transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells with linearized SapphireTM baculovirus DNA (Orbigen) and the SporoSAG/pAcGP67b modified clone. The recombinant SporoSAG encoding primary virus was subsequently amplified to generate high titer virus for use in protein production. A 4-liter volume of High Five insect cells was infected with 2.5 ml of amplified SporoSAG virus/liter of culture. The culture was harvested after 65 h and centrifuged at 450 √ó g to remove cellular debris, and the supernatant was concentrated using tangential flow and buffer-exchanged into buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1 m NaCl, 30 mm imidazole). SporoSAG was selectively purified HisTrapFF nickel affinity with fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled based on purity. Removal of the SporoSAG hexahistidine tag with thrombin was followed by gel filtration (Superdex 75) in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) and anion exchange chromatography (Source 30Q) in buffers C (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 10 mm NaCl) and D (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl) to produce sufficiently pure protein for crystallization studies. The purified SporoSAG protein begins with the N terminus sequence GSAMGPEAT (GS remaining after thrombin cleavage and AMG derived from the NcoI site) and extends through LVTVAAALVPR (AAA from the NotI site and LVPR remaining after thrombin cleavage), resulting in a total molecular mass of 25,657 Da. Crystallization trials were set up with Crystal screen HTTM, Crystal screen 2 HTTM, and PEG/ION screenTM (Hampton Research) and Precipitant SynergyTM Primary 64 crystallization screen (Emerald Biosystems) in 96-well plates (Emerald Biosystems). The final drops consisted of 1 Œºl of SporoSAG (at 25 mg/ml) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 Œºl of reservoir solution equilibrated against 100 Œºl of reservoir solution. Crystals of native SporoSAG were observed within 3 days in 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, whereas cadmium-derivatized crystals of SporoSAG grew in 1 week in 20% polyethylene glycol 4000 with 0.2 m Cd(NO3)2. SporoSAG crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor plus 20% glycerol for 30 s and flash cooled at 100 K directly in the cryostream. Diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku R-axis IV++ area detector coupled to an MM-002 x-ray generator with Osmic ‚Äúblue‚Äù optics and an Oxford Cryostream 700. Diffraction data for the native SporoSAG crystals to 1.60 √Ö and cadmium-derivatized crystals to 2.15 √Ö were processed using Crystal Clear software with d*TREK (33Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar).

High quality phases of the cadmium derivative were obtained following density modification that enabled building and registering of ‚àº80% of the backbone using ARP/Warp (35Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). The partially built SporoSAG structure was then used as a search model in molecular replacement using MOLREP (36Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) with the high resolution native data set. The remaining structure was built manually, and solvent atoms were selected using COOT (37Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Stereochemical analysis of the refined SporoSAG structure was performed with PROCHECK and SFCHECK in CCP4 (39(1994) Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr., 50, 760‚Äì763Google Scholar) with the Ramachandran plot showing excellent stereochemistry with 99.3% of the residues in the most favored and additional allowed conformations and no residues modeled in disallowed orientations. Overall, 5% of the reflections were set aside for calculation of Rfree. Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Phylogenetic clustering analyses of the 161 bioinformatically related SRS proteins have previously identified a bifurcated tree that established two evolutionarily distinct sequence clades, or subfamilies, related to SAG1 and SAG2, respectively (27Jung C. Lee C.Y. Grigg M.E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine the SRS subgroup the sporozoite protein SporoSAG most closely aligned with, prototypic sequences of SRS proteins known to cluster with the SAG1 subfamily (SAG1, SAG3, SAG5A, SAG5C, BSR4, SRS2, and SRS9) and with the SAG2 subfamily (SAG2A, SAG2C, SAG2Y, SRS20A, SRS23, SRS37A, SRS47D, and SRS47F) were aligned with SporoSAG using the structure-based PROMALS3D alignment program. The structures of SAG1, BSR4, and SporoSAG were used to anchor the alignment (see supplemental Fig. 1). A neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the PROTDIST and NEIGHBOR programs in the PHYLIP 3.68 suite of phylogenetic software, and 10,000 bootstrap replicates were run. Only nodes receiving greater than 50% support were resolved in the tree (Fig. 1). The bootstrap with neighbor-joining analysis robustly supported the inclusion of the dominant sporozoite surface antigen SporoSAG as a distal member of the SAG2 clade of sequences. A domain-based tree was also generated, and both domains of SporoSAG clustered with the SAG2 subfamily (data not shown). SAG1 and SAG2 are the dominant tachyzoite antigens expressed against which the majority of the humoral immune response is focused (40Bessi√®res M.H. Le Breton S. S√©gu√©la J.P. Parasitol. Res. 1992; 78: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 41Khan I.A. Eckel M.E. Pfefferkorn E.R. Kasper L.H. J. Infect.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 3741-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine whether the dominant sporozoite surface antigen SporoSAG is likewise immunodominant during T. gondii infections, we evaluated sera reactivity from known T. gondii-infected hosts, across a range of species and across routes of infection (Fig. 2). Ten and three serum samples (designated Oocyst), collected from patients whose infection was linked epidemiologically to the consumption of water-borne oocysts from outbreaks in Victoria, Canada (1995) and Santa Isabel do Ivai, Brazil (2001), respectively, were tested for the presence of antibodies that specifically reacted against SporoSAG (18Bowie W.R.

Dis. 2006; 12: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Control samples comprised serum from pregnant patients whose T. gondii infection was detected during routine screening and who were presumably infected via the consumption of undercooked meat (designated Bradyzoite) (12Dubey J.P. Zhu X.Q. Sundar N. Zhang H. Kwok O.C. Su C. Vet. Parasitol. 2007; 145: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 45Jones J.L. Kruszon-Moran D. Wilson M. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2003; 9: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Patient sera were evaluated across a range of titers to SAG1, with higher titers prioritized to maximize the possibility of detecting a reaction against SporoSAG. Sera from an uninfected individual and from a Type II strain oocyst-infected individual were included as the negative and positive controls, respectively. No antibody reactivity (neither IgM, IgA, nor IgG) was detected against SporoSAG in any of the human samples, suggesting that the host immune system does not mount an antibody response to this protein (Fig. 2A). This was not the result of a failure of these individuals to mount antibody responses against Toxoplasma because all patients possessed anti-SAG1 reactivity. Identical results were obtained using sera acquired from either bradyzoite-infected or sporulated oocyst-infected mice inoculated by peroral injection or via subcutaneous inoculation and developed using polyvalent anti-mouse secondary antibodies to detect IgA, IgM, and IgG (Fig. 2B). The same sporulated oocysts were also injected subcutaneously into rabbits and yielded the same results (data not shown). The lack of reactivity to SporoSAG during infection established that this highly expressed, sporozoite-specific antigen is a poor candidate reagent for the development of a test capable of detecting individuals infected by oocysts, a question of considerable epidemiologic importance. We next sought to solve the SporoSAG structure to compare its evolutionary relationship and structural features with the solved structures for the tachyzoite (SAG1) and bradyzoite (BSR4) proteins that belong to the SAG1 subfamily of SRS proteins. The cloned SporoSAG construct begins at Pro-3 and extends through Val-237, one residue short of the predicted GPI anchor site, Ser-238, that tethers the mature protein to the outer membrane of T. gondii (Fig. 3A). Production of SporoSAG in insect cells was followed by extensive purification using nickel affinity, size exclusion, and ion exchange chromatography and resulted in a protein that migrated as a single band on an SDS-PAGE gel with apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa (supplemental Fig. 2A). Initial crystallization trials produced a P6 crystal form that diffracted to 1.60 √Ö. Attempts to solve the SporoSAG structure using molecular replacement with the individual core domains of SAG1 (25He X.L. Grigg M.E. Boothroyd J.C. Garcia K.C. Nat. Struct.

Additional rounds of crystallization produced a cadmium-derivatized P21212 crystal form from which we were able to generate high quality phases using cadmium single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. It is noteworthy that SporoSAG adopts a monomer in solution, as shown by gel filtration chromatography, and crystallizes as a monomer in both crystal forms (supplemental Fig. 2, B and C). The absence of an observed dimer for SporoSAG contrasts with the structures of SAG1, which crystallized as a dimer (25He X.L. Grigg M.E. Boothroyd J.C. Garcia K.C. Nat. Struct.

https://openalex.org/W2010622427,"The fusion of TEL with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) beta (TPbeta) is found in a subset of patients with atypical myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and is the archetype of a larger group of hybrid receptors that are produced by rearrangements of PDGFR genes. TPbeta is activated by oligomerization mediated by the pointed domain of TEL/ETV6, leading to constitutive activation of the PDGFRbeta kinase domain. The receptor transmembrane (TM) domain is retained in TPbeta and in most of the described PDGFRbeta hybrids. Deletion of the TM domain (DeltaTM-TPbeta) strongly impaired the ability of TPbeta to sustain growth factor-independent cell proliferation. We confirmed that TPbeta resides in the cytosol, indicating that the PDGFRbeta TM domain does not act as a transmembrane domain in the context of the hybrid receptor but has a completely different function. The DeltaTM-TPbeta protein was expressed at a lower level because of increased degradation. It could form oligomers, was phosphorylated at a slightly higher level, co-immunoprecipitated with the p85 adaptor protein, but showed a much reduced capacity to activate STAT5 and ERK1/2 in Ba/F3 cells, compared with TPbeta. In an in vitro kinase assay, DeltaTM-TPbeta was more active than TPbeta and less sensitive to imatinib, a PDGFR inhibitor. In conclusion, we show that the TM domain is required for TPbeta-mediated signaling and proliferation, suggesting that the activation of the PDGFRbeta kinase domain is not enough for cell transformation."

The enzyme is proposed to function in the recycling of the micronutrient selenium from degraded selenoproteins containing selenocysteine residue as an essential component. The enzyme exhibits strict substrate specificity toward l-selenocysteine and no activity to its cognate l-cysteine. However, it remains unclear how the enzyme distinguishes between selenocysteine and cysteine. Here, we present mechanistic studies of selenocysteine lyase from rat. ESI-MS analysis of wild-type and C375A mutant SCL revealed that the catalytic reaction proceeds via the formation of an enzyme-bound selenopersulfide intermediate on the catalytically essential Cys-375 residue. UV-visible spectrum analysis and the crystal structure of SCL complexed with l-cysteine demonstrated that the enzyme reversibly forms a nonproductive adduct with l-cysteine. Cys-375 on the flexible loop directed l-selenocysteine, but not l-cysteine, to the correct position and orientation in the active site to initiate the catalytic reaction. These findings provide, for the first time, the basis for understanding how trace amounts of a selenium-containing substrate is distinguished from excessive amounts of its cognate sulfur-containing compound in a biological system.

These findings provide, for the first time, the basis for understanding how trace amounts of a selenium-containing substrate is distinguished from excessive amounts of its cognate sulfur-containing compound in a biological system. Selenium is an essential trace element required for the normal function of mammals (1Hatfield D.L. Selenium: Its Molecular Biology and Role in Human Health. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2001Crossref Google Scholar). It is similar to sulfur in its chemical properties and needs to be discriminated biologically from abundant sulfur during its metabolism. During the synthesis of selenoproteins, selenium is specifically incorporated into selenocysteyl-tRNASec and eventually into the specific position of the nascent polypeptide chains as directed by the UGA codon (2Small-Howard A.L. Berry M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1493-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

However, the mechanism underlying selenium-specific substrate recognition in these enzymes remains unknown. The most common selenium source in normal foods is selenocysteine and selenomethionine in proteins (8Combs Jr., G.F. Combs S.B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1984; 4: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that selenomethionine is transformed to selenocysteine through the trans-selenation pathway (9Schwarz K.

SCL is a pyridoxal 5‚Ä≤-phosphate (PLP) enzyme that catalyzes the removal of selenium from l-selenocysteine to yield l-alanine. In previous studies, we identified and characterized SCL from pig liver (11Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Citrobacter freundii (12Chocat P. Esaki N. Tanizawa K. Nakamura K. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 669-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the first enzyme that discriminately acts on a selenium-containing compound but not on its cognate sulfur analog. The cDNA cloning of mouse SCL (13Mihara H. Kurihara T. Watanabe T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6195-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) revealed that SCL belongs to subgroup V in fold type I of aminotransferases (14Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Among them, overall sequence similarity (‚àº30%) is found between mammalian SCL and cysteine desulfurases (13Mihara H. Kurihara T. Watanabe T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6195-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). SCL and cysteine desulfurase catalyze the same type of reaction, namely the removal of selenium or sulfur from selenocysteine or cysteine to yield alanine. Although bacterial cysteine desulfurases exhibit activity to both cysteine and selenocysteine (15Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), SCL shows significant specificity to selenocysteine. Mechanistic and crystal structure studies showed that the catalytic reaction of cysteine desulfurase involves the formation of sulfane sulfur in the form of a cysteine persulfide in the active site of the enzyme (16Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 17Fujii T. Maeda M. Mihara H. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Hata Y.

Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although SCL has a conserved cysteine residue at the position corresponding to the persulfide-forming cysteine residue of cysteine desulfurase, its role in the catalytic function of the enzyme has not been established. Here, we investigate the mechanism of rat SCL. Site-directed mutagenesis and ESI-MS studies using wild-type and C375A mutant of SCL show that Cys-375 is essential for the activity of SCL as the site for cysteine selenopersulfide formation. UV-visible spectrum analysis and crystal structure of SCL complexed with l-cysteine in a non-productive adduct form shows the structural basis for discrimination between selenocysteine and cysteine by the enzyme. UV-visible spectrum analysis also shows that loss of Cys-375 resulted in the formation of a non-productive adduct with selenocysteine, suggesting that Cys-375 serves as a guide to direct the substrate in an appropriate orientation for the catalytic reaction. l-Selenocystine and l-cysteine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Selenopropionate was synthesized as described in supplemental Experimental Procedures. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan). Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan) and Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). All other chemicals were analytical grade reagents. cDNA for the full-length SCL protein of Rattus norvegicus (GenBankTM/EMBL accession number NM_001007755) was cloned by PCR using the primers 5‚Ä≤-AGCGATCAGGCATATGGACGTGGCGCGGAATGGC-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-CCGGAATTCCTAGACCGGGCTTCCAGCTGGTTC-3‚Ä≤. PCR products were cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pET21a(+) for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3). The E. coli cells harboring the expression plasmid were grown in an LB medium containing 50 Œºg/ml ampicillin at 28 ¬∞C for 16 h and were harvested by centrifugation. A Tris-HCl buffer (10 mm) (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA was used as the standard buffer. The cells were disrupted by sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant solution was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (5 √ó 5 cm). After the column was washed, the enzyme was eluted with a 1.0-liter linear gradient of 0‚Äì0.5 m NaCl in the buffer. The fractions containing SCL were pooled, mixed with an equal volume of standard buffer containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, and applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl column (3 √ó 15 cm). After the column was washed, the enzyme was eluted with a 1.0-liter linear gradient of 1.0‚Äì0.6 m ammonium sulfate in the buffer. The enzyme fractions were concentrated with Centriprep YM-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at ‚àí80 ¬∞C until use without significant inactivation. Purification of the C375A mutant of SCL was performed in the same manner as described for the wild-type enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic oligonucleotides used were 5‚Ä≤-ATCCGAGTGGGCTGAAGCTCC-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-GGAGCTTCAGCCCACTCGGAT-3‚Ä≤. SCL activity was assayed by the determination of selenide with lead acetate as described previously (25Esaki N. Soda K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 26Mihara H. Esaki N. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Protein was determined using the CBB protein assay (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples of wild-type SCL and the C375A mutant for ESI-MS analysis were prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere in a glove box (Miwa, Osaka, Japan) at room temperature. SCL (230 Œºm) was incubated with l-selenocysteine (70 Œºm) in a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) and immediately separated with a MicroBioSpin 6 column (Bio-Rad). The desalted enzyme was introduced at a flow rate of 18 Œºl/min into a PE Sciex API 2000 single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source (PE-Sciex, Thornhill, ON, Canada). The mass spectrometer scanned from m/z = 800 to m/z = 1800 with a 2.0 ms dwell time and a 0.2 m/z step size. The purified enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5). SCL crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 297 K. A 2 Œºl droplet of a 35 mg¬∑ml‚àí1 protein solution mixed with the same amount of reservoir solution was equilibrated at 293 K against a 500 Œºl reservoir solution (100 mm citrate buffer pH 4.7 and 1.5 m ammonium dihydrogen phosphate). The native crystals appeared within 2 weeks of incubation and grew to maximum dimensions of 0.3 √ó 0.3 √ó 0.1 mm. The crystals (pH 4.7) were transferred to the reservoir solution adjusted to pH 8.0 using 1.5 m di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate instead of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, to produce the native crystals at pH 8.0. Crystals of SCL¬∑l-cysteine and SCL¬∑selenopropionate were obtained at 293 K by soaking the native crystals in the reservoir solution adjusted to pH 8.0. These crystals are isomorphous with the orthorhombic space group P212121, average unit cell parameters a = 55.0, b = 101.9, c = 197.3 ‚Ñ´. Assuming two monomers in the asymmetric unit, the Matthews coefficient (VM) value was calculated to be 2.96 ‚Ñ´3 Da‚àí1, indicating an estimated solvent content of 58.3% in the unit cell (27Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar). Data collection was performed at 100 K using a wavelength of 1.00 ‚Ñ´ from the synchrotron-radiation source and an ADSC Quantum CCD Camera. X-ray diffraction data sets for the unliganded SCL (pH 8.0) were collected to 2.0 ‚Ñ´ resolution on the BL5A station at the Photon Factory, KEK (Tsukuba, Japan). X-ray diffraction data sets for the SCL¬∑l-cysteine crystal and the SCL¬∑selenopropionate crystal were collected to 1.85 and 1.55 ‚Ñ´ resolution on the BL41XU and the BL38B2 station, respectively, at SPring8 (Hyogo, Japan). Data were processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The structure of the unliganded SCL (pH 8.0) was solved by the molecular replacement method with the program AMoRe (29Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) using the IscS structure (PDB ID: 1P3W) as the search model. The modeling of the polypeptide chain was performed using program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar), and the structure was refined with program CNS (31Br√ºnger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Water molecules were picked up on the basis of the peak heights (1.5 œÉ) and distance criteria (4.0 ‚Ñ´ from protein and solvent) from the sigma-weighted 2Fo ‚àí Fc map. The water molecules whose thermal factors were above the maximum thermal factor of the main chain after refinement were removed from the list. Model building and refinement cycles resulted in an Rfactor of 0.197 and an Rfree of 0.236% at 2.0 ‚Ñ´ resolution, calculated for 69817 reflections. The same refinement procedure was applied to SCL¬∑l-cysteine and SCL¬∑selenopropionate but using the coordinates of the native enzyme as the initial model. Refinement cycles resulted in an Rfactor of 0.187 and 0.211 and Rfree of 0.187 and 0.209 for SCL¬∑l-cysteine and SCL¬∑selenopropionate, respectively. Structure diagrams were drawn using MOLSCRIPT (32Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), POVSCRIPT+ (33Fenn T.D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. J. Appl.

Because our attempt to obtain crystals of SCL cloned from mouse liver (13Mihara H. Kurihara T. Watanabe T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6195-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was unsuccessful, we constructed an expression system for rat SCL. The recombinant SCL was purified to homogeneity. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that Vmax and Km values for l-selenocysteine were 26 Œºmol¬∑min‚àí1¬∑mg‚àí1 and 5.5 mm, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1). The enzyme showed no detectable activity toward l-cysteine (examined at 5‚Äì50 mm). An inhibition study showed that l-cysteine is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme with Ki = 9.6 mm (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, the fundamental properties SCL are similar to those reported for the enzymes from pig (11Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse (13Mihara H. Kurihara T. Watanabe T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6195-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). SCL has a conserved cysteine residue that corresponds to the persulfide-forming cysteine residue in cysteine desulfurases (supplemental Fig. S2) (16Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 35Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the conserved cysteine residue in SCL, we prepared a mutant SCL protein (C375A) in which Cys-375 was replaced by an alanine residue. The purified C375A mutant exhibited no activity to l-selenocysteine, suggesting that Cys-375 is a catalytically essential residue of the enzyme similar to the conserved catalytic cysteine residue of cysteine desulfurases (35Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the catalytic role of Cys-375, the formation of an SCL-bound selenopersulfide intermediate was assessed by ESI-MS analysis. The observed masses of the wild-type (47,273 Da) and the mutant (47,243 Da) SCL were consistent with their masses calculated from the amino acid sequences (47,261 and 47,229 Da, respectively) within acceptable error of ESI-MS measurement (<0.1%) (Fig. 1, A and D). Incubation of the wild-type SCL with l-selenocysteine resulted in the formation of a new species with a mass of [M + 80] (Fig. 1C). In contrast, incubation with l-cysteine resulted in no formation of such species (Fig. 1B). The data suggest that the [M + 80] species corresponds to a selenium-bound form of SCL. The C375A mutant incubated with l-selenocysteine or l-cysteine did not produce the [M + 80] molecule (Fig. 1, E and F), indicating that selenium eliminated from l-selenocysteine is bound to Cys-375 of the enzyme in the form of a cysteine selenopersulfide intermediate (SCL-S-Se‚àí). SCL shows an absorption maximum at 416 nm, which is characteristic of the internal aldimine form of PLP enzymes. Incubation of SCL with l-selenocysteine resulted in a broad increase in the absorbance at ‚àº420 nm (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the addition of l-cysteine to the enzyme caused a significant decrease in the absorption peak at 416 nm, concomitantly with the increase in that at 350 nm (Fig. 2B). The incubation with d-cysteine, d-selenocysteine, or 2-mercaptoethanol also resulted in an absorption peak shift from 416 nm to 330‚Äì340 nm in the same manner as observed in the enzyme incubated with l-cysteine (data not shown). These results indicate that l-cysteine, d-cysteine, d-selenocysteine, and 2-mercaptoethanol can enter the active site of the enzyme to affect the absorption properties of the PLP moiety even though they do not serve as a substrate of the enzyme. Interestingly, the C375A mutant enzyme incubated with l-selenocysteine or l-cysteine also showed a peak shift from 416 nm to 350 nm (Fig. 2, C and D). These results indicate that Cys-375 is essential for the proper capture of the substrate l-selenocysteine. The overall structure of SCL is shown in Fig. 3A. The polypeptide chain is folded into a dimeric form with each subunit consisting of the small (from N terminus to Leu-30 and from Thr-306 to the C terminus) and large (from Glu-31 to Glu-305) domains. The small domain has an Œ±/Œ≤ structure which consists of a two-stranded parallel Œ≤-sheet, three-stranded antiparallel Œ≤-sheet, and six helices (supplemental Fig. S3B). The large domain exhibits a typical Œ±/Œ≤ structure in which seven parallel Œ≤-strands (S2‚ÄìS8), except for S8 form an open twisted Œ≤-sheet as a core surrounded by six Œ±-helices from the solvent side and two Œ±-helices from the protein side. The seven-stranded Œ≤-sheet forms the base of the active site that binds the coenzyme PLP, and is characteristic of PLP-dependent fold type I enzyme (14Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J.

SCL changes its overall conformation from the open form to the closed form by a 3.8¬∞ rotation of the small domain as a rigid body upon binding of cysteine to the active site crevice to form the cofactor-cysteine complex (Fig. 3A). In addition to the rigid body rotation of the small domain, the cysteine binding induces the local conformational change of the extended lobe (the small domain residues from Ser-374 to Ile-392). The extended lobe of SCL in the unliganded open form was disordered and was not located on the electron density map. In contrast, the lobe in the liganded closed form was ordered to form the helix 11 (310 helix)‚Äìloop‚ÄìŒ±-helix 12-loop structure which covers the active site as a lid. In contrast to SCL, the open-closed conformational change on ligand binding was not observed in cysteine desulfurases (17Fujii T. Maeda M. Mihara H. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Hata Y.

The side chain SŒ≥ atom of the bound cysteine, but not the Œ±-amino group, makes a covalent bond with the C4‚Ä≤ atom of PLP. The residual electron density of the SŒ≥ atom of the bound cysteine was so close to C4‚Ä≤ of PLP that the SŒ≥ atom made a covalent bond with C4‚Ä≤ (supplemental Fig. S3C).

In this study, we have analyzed the molecular interactions between PMEO-DAPym-diphosphate (PMEO-DAPym-pp) and the active sites of wild-type (WT) and drug-resistant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Pre-steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that PMEO-DAPym-pp is a good substrate for WT HIV-1 RT: its catalytic efficiency of incorporation (kpol/Kd) is only 2- to 3-fold less than that of the corresponding prototype purine nucleotide analogs PMEA-pp or (R)PMPA-pp. HIV-1 RT recognizes PMEO-DAPym-pp as a purine base instead of a pyrimidine base and incorporates it opposite to thymine (in DNA) or uracil (in RNA).

We discovered a novel function of BicD1 in the modulation of G protein signaling, cell proliferation, and endocytosis downstream of PAR1. BicD1 and its C-terminal CC3 domain inhibited PAR1 signaling to Gq-phospholipase C-Œ≤ through coiled-coil interactions with the cytoplasmic 8th helix of PAR1.

https://openalex.org/W2002641118,"The food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni possesses a single-domain globin (Cgb) whose role in detoxifying nitric oxide has been unequivocally demonstrated through genetic and molecular approaches. The x-ray structure of cyanide-bound Cgb has been solved to a resolution of 1.35 A. The overall fold is a classic three-on-three alpha-helical globin fold, similar to that of myoglobin and Vgb from Vitreoscilla stercoraria. However, the D region (defined according to the standard globin fold nomenclature) of Cgb adopts a highly ordered alpha-helical conformation unlike any previously characterized members of this globin family, and the GlnE7 residue has an unexpected role in modulating the interaction between the ligand and the TyrB10 residue. The proximal hydrogen bonding network in Cgb demonstrates that the heme cofactor is ligated by an imidazolate, a characteristic of peroxidase-like proteins. Mutation of either proximal hydrogen-bonding residue (GluH23 or TyrG5) results in the loss of the high frequency nu(Fe-His) stretching mode (251 cm(-1)), indicating that both residues are important for maintaining the anionic character of the proximal histidine ligand. Cyanide binding kinetics for these proximal mutants demonstrate for the first time that proximal hydrogen bonding in globins can modulate ligand binding kinetics at the distal site. A low redox midpoint for the ferrous/ferric couple (-134 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7) is consistent with the peroxidase-like character of the Cgb active site. These data provide a new insight into the mechanism via which Campylobacter may survive host-derived nitrosative stress."

In this study, we provide evidence that human NGF may also function as a metalloproteinase inhibitor, based on studies of NGF from snake venom. Originally, our aim was to isolate snake venom metalloproteinases targeting platelet receptors and/or ligands relevant to hemostasis and thrombosis, using Ni(2+)-agarose as a purification step based on the conserved metal ion-coordination motif in venom metalloproteinases. However, subsequent analysis of cobra (Naja kaouthia) venom led to the unexpected discovery that cobra venom NGF bound to Ni(2+)-agarose, eluting at approximately 15 mm imidazole, enabling a one-step purification. The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analysis. Partial co-purification of NGF within metalloproteinase-enriched venom fractions led us to test whether NGF affected metalloproteinase activity. Venom NGF potently inhibited metalloproteinases isolated from the same or different venom and specifically bound to purified Nk metalloproteinase immobilized on agarose beads. Human NGF also interacted with human metalloproteinases because it blocked metalloproteinase-mediated shedding of the platelet collagen receptor, glycoprotein (GP)VI, and associated with recombinant ADAM10 by surface plasmon resonance. Together, these results suggest that NGF can function as a metalloproteinase inhibitor."

Acta. 2007; 1771: 746-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which accomplish transfer using a distinct two-layer ‚Äúsandwich motif,‚Äù dominated by Œ±-helices and without intramolecular disulfide bonds (9Malinina L.

A binding site for a single glycolipid molecule consists of a sugar headgroup recognition site located where the sugar-amide portion of the glycolipid is tethered via multiple hydrogen bonds to the protein's surface. A hydrophobic pocket, lined with nonpolar amino acid residues, encapsulates a major portion of the nonpolar hydrocarbon chains of the glycolipid ceramide region. The novel architecture of GLTP and its lipid liganding pocket are distinguishing features compared with other lipid binding and transfer proteins, which use conformational folds dominated by the Œ≤-sheet (i.e. Œ≤-grooves/concave cups and Œ≤-barrels) or helical bundles stabilized by multiple disulfide-bridges (i.e. saposin folds (8Brown R.E.

Currently, there is a lack of experimental data elucidating HET-C2 structure/conformation, leaving the issue of GLTP fold formation by HET-C2 unresolved. Also, HET-C2 transfer specificity for different glycolipids and the functional roles of the two Trp residues of HET-C2 in glycolipid binding and/or membrane interaction remain undefined. Herein, these issues are addressed. The different positioning of Trp residues in HET-C2 provides new insights into the membrane interaction region of the GLTP fold, whereas x-ray diffraction reveals the structural basis for the altered glycolipid specificity of the HET-C2 GLTP fold. HET-C2 was expressed and purified as detailed for GLTP (22Malakhova M.L. Malinina L. Pike H.M. Kanack A.T. Patel D.J. Brown R.E. J. Biol.

The P. anserina open reading frame encoding HET-C2 (NCBI GenBankTM number U05236) was subcloned (7Mattjus P. Turcq B. Pike H.M. Molotkovsky J.G. Brown R.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) into pET-30 Xa/LIC (Novagen) by ligation-independent cloning. Transformed BL21 cells (Escherichia coli) were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 ¬∞C overnight, induced with isopropyl 1-thio-Œ≤-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm), and then grown for 16‚Äì20 h at 15 ¬∞C. Purification of rHET-C2 from soluble lysate protein was accomplished by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. The N-terminal His-S tag was removed by factor Xa, yielding protein identical in sequence to native HET-C2. HET-C2 was repurified by FPLC SEC using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-75 preparation grade column (Amersham Biosciences). For crystallographic studies, HET-C2 was expressed using pET-SUMO vector (Invitrogen). The His-Sumo tag (N terminus) was cleaved using Ulp1 SUMO protease (Invitrogen). HET-C2 fractions obtained by SEC were pooled, centrifugally concentrated (10 kDa cut-off membrane), and verified for purity by SDS-PAGE. Reductive methylation of surface lysines was carried out to aid crystallization as described previously (23Walter T.S. Meier C. Assenberg R. Au K.F. Ren J. Verma A. Nettleship J.E. Owens R.J. Stuart D.I. Grimes J.M. Structure. 2006; 14: 1617-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Methylated HET-C2 was purified by SEC, and the extent of methylation was assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Methylated and unmethylated HET-C2 were concentrated to 30 mg/ml for crystallization screening. Diffraction quality crystals of methylated HET-C2 were obtained in 0.1 m BisTris (pH 5.5‚Äì6.5) and 25% polyethylene glycol 3350. For data collection at cryogenic temperatures, crystals were stabilized in mother liquor supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol. X-ray diffraction data for the methylated HET-C2 crystal was collected on beamline ID24-E at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory). This data set was processed using the HKL2000 suite (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Systematic absences indicated that the crystals belonged to space group P41212 or P43212. The volume of the crystal asymmetric unit was compatible with only one subunit and a protein volume per unit of molecular mass of 2.9 ‚Ñ´3 Da‚àí1 with a calculated solvent content of 58.1% (v/v). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (25McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14567) Google Scholar) with human apoGLTP (Protein Data Bank 1SWX) structure as a search model in space group P41212. Refinement was carried out using REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

CD spectra were collected using a J-810 spectropolarimeter (JASCO) equipped with a CTC-345 temperature control system at 0.05 mm HET-C2 in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4; 10 ¬∞C) while purging continuously with N2. Spectral and temperature dependence measurements in the far-UV range (185‚Äì250 nm) were performed at a 2-nm bandwidth using a U-type quartz cell (0.148-mm path length) and in the near-UV range (250‚Äì320 nm) at 1 nm bandwidth with a rectangular cell (0.5-cm path length) in a custom-built thermostated cell holder (34Sreerama N.

Five accumulations were recorded, each at a 20-nm/min scan rate with a 2-s response time. The temperature dependence of ellipticity at 222 nm was measured using a 60 ¬∞C/h scan rate and 8-s response time. Solvent evaporation was prevented by placing a drop of oil (repeatedly boiled in water to remove soluble impurities) on the top of the sample cell. CD spectra in the far-UV range were smoothed using the JASCO noise reduction routine. The CDPro program suite (34Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal.

Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar)), was used to calculate HET-C2 secondary structure from far-UV CD spectra. Tertiary structure class was assessed using the CDPro CLUSTER program (37Venyaminov S. Vassilenko K.S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (see supplemental material for details). HET-C2 concentration was measured at 280 nm using a DU 640 spectrophotometer (Beckman) at 1.8-nm bandwidth and a molar absorptivity of 17.12 mm‚àí1 cm‚àí1, obtained by averaging results from four calculation methods (41Mihaly E.J.

Spectra were corrected for turbidity by plotting the log dependence of the solution absorbance versus the log of the wavelength and extrapolating the linear dependence between these quantities in the 340‚Äì440 nm range to the 240‚Äì300 nm absorption range, using the DU-640 scatter correction routine. Extrapolated absorbance values were subtracted from measured values, decreasing the apparent protein absorbance at ‚àº280 nm by ‚àº15%. Trp fluorescence (295 nm excitation) was measured at 25 ¬∞C from 310 to 420 nm with a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorometer (Horiba Scientific) using excitation and emission bandpasses of 5 nm. Protein concentration was kept at A295 < 0.1 to avoid inner filter effects (45Li X.M. Malakhova M.L. Lin X. Pike H.M. Chung T. Molotkovsky J.G. Brown R.E.

Fluorescence quenching experiments were performed by adding aliquots of acrylamide or KI (5 m) stocks in 10 mm sodium phosphate-saline buffer (pH 7.4) to HET-C2 (1 Œºm; 2.5 ml) with constant stirring at 25 ¬∞C. With KI, 10 mm sodium thiosulfate was added to the stock solution to prevent the formation of I3‚àí, which absorbs in the region of Trp fluorescence (45Li X.M. Malakhova M.L. Lin X. Pike H.M.

Data were corrected for dilution effects and analyzed using the Stern-Volmer and modified Stern-Volmer equations as detailed in the supplemental material. To assess membrane interaction, vesicles consisting of POPC/glycolipid (8:2) (1.5 mm) or POPC (1.5 mm) were added stepwise to HET-C2 (1 Œºm) in small aliquots while monitoring Trp emission. Lipids also were presented to HET-C2 by microinjection after dissolving in ethanol as recently detailed by Zhai et al. (46Zhai X. Malakhova M.L. Pike H.M. Benson L.M. Bergen 3rd, H.R. Sug√°r I.P.

Measurements were performed under constant stirring by the addition of small aliquots (1 Œºl) of GSL, dissolved in ethanol (0.1 mm), to protein (1 Œºm; 2.5 ml). Fluorescence titration curves were analyzed according to Equation 1,Œµ‚àí1=(Œµb‚àí1)‚àíKd(Œµ‚àí1)/mn(Eq. 1) where Kd is the dissociation constant of lipid-protein complex, m is lipid concentration, and n is the number of lipid binding sites (47Bashford C.L. Chance B. Smith J.C. Yoshida T. Biophys. J. 1979; 25: 63-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 48Martin I. Ruysschaert J.M. Sanders D. Giffard C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). œµ is the spectral parameter value (emission wavelength maximum (Œªmax expressed as wavenumber) or relative intensity, I) accompanying lipid binding to HET-C2 at lipid concentration m. Thus, œµ can represent either I/I0 or (Œªmax)0/Œªmax, where the subscript 0 indicates values in the absence of lipid. œµb represents spectral properties of the protein-lipid complex. According to Equation 1, the slope of œµ ‚àí 1 versus (œµ ‚àí 1)/m yields Kd/n and represents the reciprocal of the protein/lipid association constant. HET-C2 and HET-C2-glycolipid complex (10 Œºm protein) were analyzed using an Agilent MSD-TOF mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA) in 5 mm ammonium acetate by infusing directly into the electrospray source. Spectra were collected in positive mode over a 500‚Äì5000 m/z range using parameters optimized for complex stability (e.g. capillary, 3000 V; fragmentor, 300 V; skimmer, 60 V; Oct RF, 300 V; Oct DC, 32 V. Raw spectral data were transformed into relative molecular masses using the Agilent TOF Protein Confirmation software. Limited sequence homology between HET-C2 and porcine GLTP was first noted by Saupe et al. (5Saupe S. Descamps C. Turcq B. B√©gueret J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Subsequently, glycolipid intermembrane transfer by HET-C2 was shown with radiolabeled and fluorescently labeled galactosylceramide (7Mattjus P. Turcq B. Pike H.M. Molotkovsky J.G. Brown R.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These findings occurred prior to structural resolution of human GLTP and mapping of the glycolipid binding site in the GLTP fold (9Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Kanack A.T. Lu M. Abagyan R. Brown R.E. Patel D.J.

Biol. 2006; 355: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To define HET-C2 conformation and localize residues potentially involved in glycolipid binding, the HET-C2 structure was solved by x-ray crystallography. Formation of high quality crystals of apoHET-C2 was greatly facilitated by mild reductive methylation of surface Lys residues (23Walter T.S. Meier C. Assenberg R. Au K.F. Ren J. Verma A. Nettleship J.E. Owens R.J. Stuart D.I. Grimes J.M. Structure. 2006; 14: 1617-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), enabling resolution to 1.9 ‚Ñ´ by molecular replacement (human apoGLTP was the search model) (9Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Kanack A.T. Lu M. Abagyan R. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The electron density throughout the polypeptide chain was of good quality except for residues 1‚Äì13 and 99, presumably due to disordering. The final crystallographic model was refined to R and Rfree values of 21.6 and 24.8%, respectively (Table 1). The HET-C2 conformational architecture strongly resembles the human GLTP fold (9Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 430: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Kanack A.T. Lu M. Abagyan R. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), showing the distinctive two-layer ‚Äúsandwich motif‚Äù dominated by Œ±-helices (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Like GLTP, HET-C2 has eight Œ±-helices with one layer consisting of Œ±1, Œ±2, Œ±6, and Œ±7, whereas Œ±3, Œ±4, Œ±5, and Œ±8 make up the other layer. Unlike GLTP, a small anti-parallel Œ≤-sheet is present near the N terminus of HET-C2. The two Cys residues (Cys118 and Cys162) present in HET-C2 are too far apart for disulfide stabilization. The N-terminal region of HET-C2 is disordered, as in GLTP, but is more extended by ‚àº16 amino acids (Fig. 1, B and C). Superpositioning of HET-C2 and human GLTP shows that most residues present in the sugar binding pocket and hydrophobic channel are conserved. In HET-C2, Asp66, Asn70, Lys73, Trp109, and His147 are properly positioned to form a sugar headgroup binding site, selective for glycolipids (Fig. 2A). This putative sugar headgroup recognition center is located at the entrance to a hydrophobic pocket, where the nonpolar hydrocarbon chains of the glycolipid are expected to localize. The hydrophobic pocket is lined by 2 dozen nonpolar residues, most of them identical to those lining the hydrophobic pocket of GLTP (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2A, structural superposition of HET-C2 (magenta) and GLTP (green) showing conserved residues present in the pocket that interacts with the sugar-amide moiety of glycolipids. Lys73 in HET-C2 is shown containing the exogenous dimethyl group introduced to facilitate crystallization. Human apoGLTP structure was solved previously (9Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Teplov A.

C, docking of Glc onto the GSL headgroup binding site of HET-C2. Side chains of HET-C2 residues involved in Glc binding are shown in magenta. The Glc sugar ring is colored yellow with red balls representing oxygen. The black dotted lines represent hydrogen bonds. To provide spatial relationships reflecting the situation in wild type HET-C2, the exogenous dimethyl group added to Lys73 to facilitate HET-C2 crystallization is not shown.
