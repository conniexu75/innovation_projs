https://openalex.org/W2888229558,"Snowball sampling is a commonly employed sampling method in qualitative research; however, the diversity of samples generated via this method has repeatedly been questioned. Scholars have posited several anecdotally based recommendations for enhancing the diversity of snowball samples. In this study, we performed the first quantitative, medium-N analysis of snowball sampling to identify pathways to sample diversity, analysing 211 reach-outs conducted via snowball sampling, resulting in 81 interviews; these interviews were administered between April and August 2015 for a research project on anti-dam movements in Southeast Asia. Based upon this analysis, we were able to refine and enhance the previous recommendations (e.g., showcasing novel evidence on the value of multiple seeds or face-to-face interviews). This paper may thus be of particular interest to scholars employing or intending to employ snowball sampling."
https://openalex.org/W2888738758,"Plastic waste in the environment is a significant threat due to its resistance to biological processes. Here we report the ability of fungal strains found on floating plastic debris to degrade plastics. In particular, we wanted to know which fungi grow on plastic debris floating in the shoreline, whether these fungi have the ability to degrade plastics, whether the plastic-degrading fungi can degrade other complex C-polymers such as lignin, and whether lignin-degraders vice versa can also break down plastics. Overall, more than a hundred fungal strains were isolated from plastic debris of the shoreline of Lake Zurich, Switzerland, and grouped morphologically. Representative strains of these groups were then selected and genetically identified, altogether twelve different fungal species and one species of Oomycota. The list of fungi included commonly occurring saprotrophic fungi but also some plant pathogens. These fungal strains were then used to test the ability to degrade polyethylene and polyurethane. The tests showed that none of the strains were able to degrade polyethylene. However, four strains were able to degrade polyurethane, the three litter-saprotrophic fungi Cladosporium cladosporioides, Xepiculopsis graminea, and Penicillium griseofulvum and the plant pathogen Leptosphaeria sp. A series of additional fungi with an origin other than from plastic debris were tested as well. Here, only the two litter-saprotrophic fungi Agaricus bisporus and Marasmius oreades showed the capability to degrade polyurethane. In contrast, wood-saprotrophic fungi and ectomycorrhizal fungi were unable to degrade polyurethane. Overall, it seems that in majority only a few litter-saprotrophic fungi, which possess a wide variety of enzymes, have the ability to degrade polyurethane. None of the fungi tested was able to degrade polyethylene."
https://openalex.org/W2888324119,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a cause of healthcare-associated infections. Although A. baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen, its infections are notoriously difficult to treat due to intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance, often limiting effective therapeutic options. A. baumannii can survive for long periods in the hospital environment, particularly on inanimate surfaces. Such environments may act as a reservoir for cross-colonization and infection outbreaks and should be considered a substantial factor in infection control practices. Moreover, clothing of healthcare personnel and gadgets may play a role in the spread of nosocomial bacteria. A link between contamination of hospital surfaces and A. baumannii infections or between its persistence in the environment and its virulence has not yet been established. Bacteria under stress (i.e., long-term desiccation in hospital setting) could conserve factors that favor infection. To investigate whether desiccation and/or starvation may be involved in the ability of certain strains of A. baumannii to retain virulence factors, we have studied five well-characterized clinical isolates of A. baumannii for which survival times were determined under simulated hospital conditions. Despite a considerable reduction in the culturability over time (up to 88% depending on strain and the condition tested), some A. baumannii strains were able to maintain their ability to form biofilms after rehydration, addition of nutrients, and changing temperature. Also, after long-term desiccation, several clinical strains were able to grow in the presence of non-immune human serum as fine as their non-stressed homologs. Furthermore, we also show that the ability of bacterial strains to kill Galleria mellonella larvae does not change although A. baumannii cells were stressed by long-term starvation (up to 60 days). This means that A. baumannii can undergo a rapid adaptation to both the temperature shift and nutrients availability, conditions that can be easily found by bacteria in a new patient in the hospital setting."
https://openalex.org/W2888221155,"Context Current drugs for chronic hepatitis B therapy have a poor efficacy in terms of post-treatment sustained viral suppression and generate important side effects during and after therapy. Therapeutic vaccination with HBV antigens is an attractive alternative to test. Objective Evaluating the efficacy of a therapeutic vaccine candidate (designated NASVAC) containing both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and core antigen (HBcAg) versus pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) in naïve chronic hepatitis B patients. Design, setting, participants An open phase III, randomised and treatment controlled clinical trial was conducted in a total of 160 CHB patients, allocated into two groups of 80 patients each to receive NASVAC or Peg-IFN. The vaccine formulation comprised 100 μg of each HBsAg and HBcAg, and was administered in 2 cycles of 5 doses. The control group received 48 subcutaneous injections of Peg-IFN alfa 2b, 180 μg per dose, every week, for 48 consecutive weeks. Main outcome measure The primary outcome measure was in relation with the proportion of patients showing reduction of the viral load under the limit of detection (250 copies/mL) after 24 weeks of treatment completion. Results Sustained control of HBV DNA was significantly more common in NASVAC group (p<0.05) at 24 weeks of follow up. NASVAC-induced increases of alanine aminotransferases (ALT) were detected in 85% patients after 5 nasal vaccinations, although seen in only 30% of patients receiving Peg-IFN. At the end of treatment (EOT) antiviral effect was comparable in both NASVAC and Peg-IFN groups. Clearance of Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was also more frequent in NASVAC group compared to Peg-IFN recipients. A lower progression to cirrhosis was found in NASVAC group compared to Peg-IFN group. Conclusion Nasvac induced a superior reduction of the viral load under the limit of detection compared to Peg-IFN treatment. It is a safe and efficacious finite alternative of antiviral treatment for CHB patients. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 01374308."
https://openalex.org/W2888605056,"Functional tests are commonly used for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). However, the relative and absolute reliability of such physical performance-outcome assessments must first be determined in specific patient cohorts. The aims of this study were to assess the relative and the absolute reliability of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), One-Legged Stance Test (OLST), and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, as well as the minimal detectable change (MDC) scores for these tests in CKD patients receiving HD. Seventy-one end-stage CKD patients receiving HD therapy, aged between 21 and 90 years, participated in the study. The patients completed two testing sessions one to two weeks apart and performed by the same examiner, comprising the following tests: the SPPB (n = 65), OLST (n = 62), and TUG test (n = 66). High intraclass correlation coefficients (≥0.90) were found for all the tests, suggesting that their relative reliability is excellent. The MDC scores for the 90% confidence intervals were as follows: 1.7 points for the SPPB, 11.3 seconds for the OLST, and 2.9 seconds for the TUG test. The reliability of the SPPB, OLST, and TUG test for this sample were all considered to be acceptable. The MDC data generated by these tests can be used to monitor meaningful changes in the functional capacity of the daily living-related activity of CKD patients on HD."
https://openalex.org/W2888315237,"In recent decades large fires have affected communities throughout central and southern Chile with great social and ecological consequences. Despite this high fire activity, the controls and drivers and the spatiotemporal pattern of fires are not well understood. To identify the large-scale trends and drivers of recent fire activity across six regions in south-central Chile (~32–40° S Latitude) we evaluated MODIS satellite-derived fire detections and compared this data with Chilean Forest Service records for the period 2001–2017. MODIS burned area estimates provide a spatially and temporally comprehensive record of fire activity across an important bioclimatic transition zone between dry Mediterranean shrublands/sclerophyllous forests and wetter deciduous-broadleaf evergreen forests. Results suggest fire activity was highly variable in any given year, with no statistically significant trend in the number of fires or mean annual area burned. Evaluation of the variables associated with spatiotemporal patterns of fire for the 2001–2017 period indicate vegetation type, biophysical conditions (e.g., elevation, slope), mean annual and seasonal climatic conditions (e.g., precipitation) and mean population density have the greatest influence on the probability of fire occurrence and burned area for any given year. Both the number of fires and annual area burned were greatest in warmer, biomass-rich lowland Bío-Bío and Araucanía regions. Resource selection analyses indicate fire ‘preferentially’ occurs in exotic plantation forests, mixed native-exotic forests, native sclerophyll forests, pasture lands and matorral, vegetation types that all provide abundant, flammable and connected biomass for burning. Structurally and compositionally homogenous exotic plantation forests may promote fire spread greater than native deciduous-Nothofagaceae forests which were once widespread in the southern parts of the study area. In the future, the coincidence of warmer and drier conditions in landscapes dominated by flammable and fuel-rich forest plantations and mixed native-exotic and sclerophyll forests are likely to further promote large fires in south-central Chile."
https://openalex.org/W2888292739,"In open-skill sports such as soccer, the environment surrounding players is rapidly changing. Therefore, players are required to process a large amount of external information and take appropriate actions in a very short period. Executive functions (EFs)—the cognitive control processes that regulate thoughts and action—are needed for high performance in soccer. In this study, we measured the EFs of young soccer players aged 8–11 years, who were applying for admission to an elite youth program of a Japanese Football League club. We found that even though admission was determined by the soccer performance of the players, significant differences were observed between players who were approved and those who were not approved into the program. Soccer players who had been approved into the program got higher scores in general EFs tests than those who had been rejected. Our results proposed that measuring EFs provides coaches with another objective way to assess the performance levels of soccer players."
https://openalex.org/W2888424695,"Cancer Waiting Time targets have been integrated into successive cancer strategies as indicators of cancer care quality in England. These targets are reported in national statistics for all cancers combined, but there is mixed evidence of their benefits and it is unclear if meeting Cancer Waiting Time targets, as currently defined and published, is associated with improved survival for individual patients, and thus if survival is a good metric for judging the utility of the targets.We used individually-linked data from the National Cancer Waiting Times Monitoring Dataset (CWT), the cancer registry and other routinely collected datasets. The study population consisted of all adult patients diagnosed in England (2009-2013) with colorectal (164,890), lung (171,208) or ovarian (24,545) cancer, of whom 82%, 76%, and 77%, respectively, had a CWT matching record. The main outcome was one-year net survival for all matched patients by target attainment ('met/not met'). The time to each type of treatment for the 31-day and 62-day targets was estimated using multivariable analyses, adjusting for age, sex, tumour stage and deprivation. The two-week wait (TWW) from GP referral to specialist consultation and 31-day target from decision to treat to start of treatment were met for more than 95% of patients, but the 62-day target from GP referral to start of treatment was missed more often. There was little evidence of an association between meeting the TWW target and one-year net survival, but for the 31-day and 62-day targets, survival was worse for those for whom the targets were met (e.g. colorectal cancer: survival 89.1% (95%CI 88.9-89.4) for patients with 31-day target met, 96.9% (95%CI 96.1-91.7) for patients for whom it was not met). Time-to-treatment analyses showed that treatments recorded as palliative were given earlier in time, than treatments with potentially curative intent. There are possible limitations in the accuracy of the categorisation of treatment variables which do not allow for fully distinguishing, for example, between curative and palliative intent; and it is difficult in these data to assess the appropriateness of treatment by stage. These limitations in the nature of the data do not affect the survival estimates found, but do mean that it is not possible to separate those patients for whom the times between referral, decision to treat and start of treatment could actually have an impact on the clinical outcomes. This means that the use of these survival measures to evaluate the targets would be misleading.Based on these individually-linked data, and for the cancers we looked at, we did not find that Cancer Waiting Time targets being met translates into improved one-year survival. Patients may benefit psychologically from limited waits which encourage timely treatment, but one-year survival is not a useful measure for evaluating Trust performance with regards to Cancer Waiting Time targets, which are not currently stratified by stage or treatment type. As such, the current composition of the data means target compliance needs further evaluation before being used for the assessment of clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2888132367,"Diabetic retinopathy is a vascular disease of the retina characterised by hyperglycaemic and inflammatory processes. Most animal models of diabetic retinopathy are hyperglycaemia-only models that do not account for the significant role that inflammation plays in the development of the disease. In the present study, we present data on the establishment of a new animal model of diabetic retinopathy that incorporates both hyperglycaemia and inflammation. We hypothesized that inflammation may trigger and worsen the development of diabetic retinopathy in a hyperglycaemic environment. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, were therefore injected into the vitreous of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. CD1 mice were used as same genetic background controls. Fundus and optical coherence tomography images were obtained before (day 0) as well as on days 2 and 7 after intravitreal cytokine injection to assess vessel dilation and beading, retinal and vitreous hyper-reflective foci and retinal thickness. Astrogliosis and microgliosis were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Results showed that intravitreal cytokines induced vessel dilation, beading, severe vitreous hyper-reflective foci, retinal oedema, increased astrogliosis and microglia upregulation in diabetic NOD mice. Intravitreal injection of inflammatory cytokines into the eyes of diabetic mice therefore appears to provide a new model of diabetic retinopathy that could be used for the study of disease progression and treatment strategies."

Limited data have explored health care worker (HCW) perceptions of strain.Cross-sectional survey of HCW across 16 Alberta ICUs. A web-based questionnaire captured data on demographics, strain definition, and sources, impact and strategies for management.658 HCW responded (33%; 95%CI, 32-36%), of which 452 were nurses (69%), 128 allied health (19%), 45 physicians (7%) and 33 administrators (5%). Participants (agreed/strongly agreed: 94%) reported that strain was best defined as ""a time-varying imbalance between the supply of available beds, staff and/or resources and the demand to provide high-quality care for patients who may become or who are critically ill""; while some recommended defining ""high-quality care"", integrating ""safety"", and families in the definition. Participants reported significant contributors to strain were: ""inability to discharge ICU patients due to lack of available ward beds"" (97%); ""increases in the volume"" (89%); and ""acuity and complexity of patients requiring ICU support"" (88%). Strain was perceived to ""increase stress levels in health care providers"" (98%); and ""burnout in health care providers"" (96%). The highest ranked strategies were: ""have more consistent and better goals-of-care conversations with patients/families outside of ICU"" (95%); and ""increase non-acute care beds"" (92%).Strain is perceived as common. HCW believe precipitants represent a mix of patient-related and operational factors. Strain is thought to have negative implications for quality of care, HCW well-being and workplace environment. Most indicated strategies ""outside"" of ICU settings were priorities for managing strain."
https://openalex.org/W2888383426,"Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is a new modality used for the treatment of glioblastoma. It is based on antineoplastic low-intensity electric fields induced by two pairs of electrode arrays placed on the patient’s scalp. The layout of the arrays greatly impacts the intensity (dose) of TTFields in the pathology. The present study systematically characterizes the impact of array position on the TTFields distribution calculated in a realistic human head model using finite element methods. We investigate systematic rotations of arrays around a central craniocaudal axis of the head and identify optimal layouts for a large range of (nineteen) different frontoparietal tumor positions. In addition, we present comprehensive graphical representations and animations to support the users’ understanding of TTFields. For most tumors, we identified two optimal array positions. These positions varied with the translation of the tumor in the anterior-posterior direction but not in the left-right direction. The two optimal directions were oriented approximately orthogonally and when combining two pairs of orthogonal arrays, equivalent to clinical TTFields therapy, we correspondingly found a single optimum position. In most cases, an oblique layout with the fields oriented at forty-five degrees to the sagittal plane was superior to the commonly used anterior-posterior and left-right combinations of arrays. The oblique configuration may be used as an effective and viable configuration for most frontoparietal tumors. Our results may be applied to assist clinical decision-making in various challenging situations associated with TTFields. This includes situations in which circumstances, such as therapy-induced skin rash, scar tissue or shunt therapy, etc., require layouts alternative to the prescribed. More accurate distributions should, however, be based on patient-specific models. Future work is needed to assess the robustness of the presented results towards variations in conductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2888563801,"Supplementation with probiotics in preterm infants reduces necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis. Bovine lactoferrin is a promising supplement that may further reduce disease burden, but its effects on probiotic bacteria in human breast milk has not been evaluated. We aimed to characterise the antimicrobial activity of bovine and human lactoferrin in human breast milk against probiotics and typical neonatal sepsis pathogens. Lactoferrin levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in fresh and pasteurised human breast milk. The neonatal pathogens Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, and the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve strain M-16V were cultured in human breast milk or infant formula in the presence or absence of clinically relevant doses of bovine or human lactoferrin. Standard microbiological methods were used to determine the effects of lactoferrin on bacterial growth. Unpasteurised human breast milk contained significantly higher lactoferrin levels and resulted in superior inhibition of pathogenic bacterial growth compared to infant formula and pasteurised human breast milk. Human lactoferrin was significantly more effective at inhibiting bacterial growth, when compared to bovine lactoferrin. Supplementation with human lactoferrin or high dose bovine lactoferrin inhibited growth of the probiotic strain B. breve M-16V in pasteurised human breast milk. Although unpasteurised human breast milk and human lactoferrin had the greatest antimicrobial activity against all bacterial species tested, higher doses of bovine lactoferrin also showed activity against B. breve and. S. epidermidis. This study suggests that simultaneous administration of lactoferrins and probiotics may affect colonisation with probiotic bacteria, warranting further investigations."

Large backup and storage facilities are necessary to secure the supply in periods of low renewable generation, especially in countries with a high share of renewables. We show that strong climate change is likely to impede the system integration of intermittent wind energy. To this end, we analyze the temporal characteristics of wind power generation based on high-resolution climate projections for Europe and uncover a robust increase of backup energy and storage needs in most of Central, Northern and North-Western Europe. This effect can be traced back to an increase of the likelihood for long periods of low wind generation and an increase in the seasonal wind variability."
https://openalex.org/W2888593254,"Schistosomiasis remains one of the most prevalent parasitic infections in the world and has significant economic and public health consequences, particularly in poor communities. Reliable and accurate diagnosis plays a key role in surveillance, prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Currently, the microscopic Kato Katz (KK) stool thick smear technique is the most commonly used method to diagnose Schistosoma mansoni infections in epidemiological surveys. It is well-known that the sensitivity of this parasitological method decreases when infection intensities are moderate to low, however. The urine-based Point-of Care Circulating Cathodic Antigen (POC-CCA) test has been extensively evaluated as a further diagnostic tool. Several studies have shown that the POC-CCA test is more sensitive but less specific than the KK method. However, to clarify the meaning of inconsistent results between KK and POC-CCA tests in clinical routine, this study compares the accuracy of microscopy and POC-CCA versus real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) results of urine and faecal samples from African school children participants.This was a school-based cross-sectional study conducted in 2015 among 305 school children aged 7-16 years from two primary schools located in Ilemela and Magu Districts, north-western Tanzania. Single stool and urine samples were collected from each participant and examined for the presence of Schistosoma mansoni eggs, parasite antigen, and parasite DNA using KK thick smears, POC-CCA tests, and real-time PCR, respectively.The prevalence of S. mansoni infection, calculated by KK was 85.2%, by real-time PCR 92.9% and by POC-CCA 94.9%. In comparison to KK, the POC-CCA and real-time PCR tests had sensitivities of 89.7% and 99.5% and specificities of 22.73% and 29.55%, respectively. However, due to the known limitations of the KK assay, we also used latent class analysis (LCA) that included POC-CCA, KK, and schistosome-specific real-time PCR results to determine their sensitivities and specificities. The POC-CCA test had the highest sensitivity (99.5%) and a specificity of 63.4% by LCA and the real-time PCR test had a sensitivity of 98.7% and the highest specificity (81.2%).In moderate and high prevalence areas, the POC-CCA cassette test is more sensitive than the KK method and can be used for screening and geographical mapping of S. mansoni infections. Real-time PCR is highly sensitive and also shows the highest specificity among the 3 investigated diagnostic procedures. It can offer added value in diagnosing schistosomiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2888580735,"Severe mental illness is a major driver of worldwide disease burden. Shared decision-making is critical for high quality care, and can enhance patient satisfaction and outcomes. However, it has not been translated into routine practice. This reflects a lack of evidence on the best way to implement shared decision-making, and the challenges of implementation in routine settings with limited resources. Our aim was to test whether we could deliver a practical and feasible intervention in routine community mental health services to embed shared decision-making for patients with severe mental illness, by improving patient and carer involvement in care planning.We cluster randomised community mental health teams to the training intervention or usual care, to avoid contamination. Training was co-delivered to a total of 350 staff in 18 teams by clinical academics, working alongside patients and carers. The primary outcome was the Health Care Climate Questionnaire, a self-report measure of 'autonomy support'. Primary and secondary outcomes were collected by self-report, six months after allocation.In total, 604 patients and 90 carers were recruited to main trial cohort. Retention at six months was 82% (n = 497). In the main analysis, results showed no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome between the intervention and usual care at 6 months (adjusted mean difference -0.064, 95% CI -0.343 to 0.215, p = 0.654). We found significant effects on only 1 secondary outcome.An intervention to embed shared decision-making in routine practice by improving involvement in care planning was well attended and acceptable to staff, but had no significant effects on patient outcomes. Enhancing shared decision-making may require considerably greater investment of resources and effects may only be apparent over the longer term."
https://openalex.org/W2888235002,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a lipophilic compound widely used in the manufacture of plastic items and thought to play a role in the growing obesity epidemic. Recent publications suggest that BPA may have a pro-adipogenic effect. Here we explore the effect of low, but environmentally relevant, concentrations of BPA on adipogenesis using a variety of cellular models. Mouse 3T3-L1, C3H10T1/2 and human adipose-derived stromal cells (hADSCs) were cultured with BPA concentrations ranging from 0.1nM to 100μM. We failed to observe positive effects on differentiation at any dose or in any model. 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated with high concentrations of BPA showed decreased mRNA expression of several adipocyte markers. Mature adipocytes differentiated in the presence of BPA were insulin resistant, with an approximate 25% reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, and an increase in mRNA levels of inflammatory markers (i.e. IL-6, TNFα). In conclusion, low, but environmentally relevant, doses of BPA may contribute to the development of a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state in exposed adipocytes, which in turn may affect adipose tissue insulin sensitivity, independent of adipogenesis. These studies suggest an alternative mechanism by which BPA may contribute to the development of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2888292424,"The Brazilian Cerrado is one of the most endangered biomes in the world. We evaluated the sustainability of leaf harvest in one of the most important Cerrado tree species, Stryphnodendron adstringens. The bark of this tree is used as a source of medicinal tannin. Harvesting bark, however, often kills the tree. In a manipulative field experiment, we tested the hypothesis that harvesting leaves, which might serve as an alternative source of tannin, would be less detrimental for tree survival, growth, reproduction, and defense than harvesting bark. In a two-way crossed experimental design, we either clipped 100% of a plant’s leaves or applied NPK fertilizer to the soil. Our predictions of the experimental outcomes were based on plant resource and defense theory. Growth was determined by total leaf dry mass production, reproduction by inflorescence and fruit production traits, and defense by total phenolics, hydrolyzable tannins, and condensed tannins. Fertilization had a marginally positive effect on total leaf dry mass. Defoliation had no effect on subsequent leaf production, and most importantly, no plants died as a result of defoliation. We found high tannin amounts in leaves of S. adstringens produced both prior to and subsequent to clipping, further suggesting that leaves could serve as a sustainable alternative source of tannin. After clipping, plants invested more in tannin production and less in reproduction. Our results suggest that leaf harvest may be more sustainable than harvesting of bark in S. adstringens. We suggest the need for further investigation of the medicinal properties of leaf tannins to formulate a viable sustainable management plan for the exploitation of this plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2883350550,"Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are a major clinical and public health problem world-wide. The prompt reporting of suspected ADRs to regulatory authorities to activate drug safety surveillance and regulation appears to be the most pragmatic measure for addressing the problem. This paper evaluated a pharmacovigilance (PV) training model that was designed to improve the reporting of ADRs in public health programs treating the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria.A Structured Pharmacovigilance and Training Initiative (SPHAR-TI) model based on the World Health Organization accredited Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative (SOR-IT) model was designed and implemented over a period of 12 months. A prospective cohort design was deployed to evaluate the outcomes of the model. The primary outcomes were knowledge gained and Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) (completed adverse drug reactions monitoring forms) submitted, while the secondary outcomes were facility based Pharmacovigilance Committees activated and health facility healthcare workers trained by the participants.Fifty-five (98%) participants were trained and followed up for 12 months. More than three quarter of the participants have never received training on pharmacovigilance prior to the course. Yet, a significant gain in knowledge was observed after the participants completed a comprehensive training for six days. In only seven months, 3000 ICSRs (with 100% completeness) were submitted, 2,937 facility based healthcare workers trained and 46 Pharmacovigilance Committees activated by the participants. Overall, a 273% increase in ICSRs submission to the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) was observed.Participants gained knowledge, which tended to increase the reporting of ADRs. The SPHAR-TI model could be an option for strengthening the continuous reporting of ADRs in public health programs in resource limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2888241607,"Background Dofetilide is an effective antiarrhythmic medication for rhythm control in atrial fibrillation, but carries a significant risk of pro-arrhythmia and requires meticulous dosing and monitoring. The cornerstone of this monitoring, measurement of the QT/QTc interval, is an imperfect surrogate for plasma concentration, efficacy, and risk of pro-arrhythmic potential. Objective The aim of our study was to test the application of a deep learning approach (using a convolutional neural network) to assess morphological changes on the surface ECG (beyond the QT interval) in relation to dofetilide plasma concentrations. Methods We obtained publically available serial ECGs and plasma drug concentrations from 42 healthy subjects who received dofetilide or placebo in a placebo‐controlled cross‐over randomized controlled clinical trial. Three replicate 10-s ECGs were extracted at predefined time-points with simultaneous measurement of dofetilide plasma concentration We developed a deep learning algorithm to predict dofetilide plasma concentration in 30 subjects and then tested the model in the remaining 12 subjects. We compared the deep leaning approach to a linear model based only on QTc. Results Fourty two healthy subjects (21 females, 21 males) were studied with a mean age of 26.9 ± 5.5 years. A linear model of the QTc correlated reasonably well with dofetilide drug levels (r = 0.64). The best correlation to dofetilide level was achieved with the deep learning model (r = 0.85). Conclusion This proof of concept study suggests that artificial intelligence (deep learning/neural network) applied to the surface ECG is superior to analysis of the QT interval alone in predicting plasma dofetilide concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2888574419,"Genetic and sexual factors influence the prevalence and the pathogenesis of many inflammatory disorders. In this study their relevance on the peripheral and central inflammatory status induced by a peripheral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was evaluated. BALB/c and CD-1 male and female mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS. Spleens and brains were collected 2 and 72 hours later to study the levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β. Percentage of microglia and astrocytes was determined in the cortex and hippocampus. Locomotor activity was registered before and during the 72 hours after LPS-treatment. Two hours after LPS-injection, a peripheral increase of the three cytokines was found. In brains, LPS increased TNF-α only in males with higher levels in CD-1 than BALB/c. IL-1β increased only in CD-1 males. IL-6 increased in both strains with lower levels in BALB/c females. Peripheral and central levels of cytokines decline 72 hrs after LPS-treatment whilst a significantly increase of Iba-1 expression was detected. A dramatic drop of the locomotor activity was observed immediately after LPS injection. Our results show that acute systemic administration of LPS leads to peripheral and central increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglia activation, in a strain and sex dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2888546046,"The accumulation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) associated Amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers can trigger aberrant intracellular calcium (Ca2+) levels by disrupting the intrinsic Ca2+ regulatory mechanism within cells. These disruptions can cause changes in homeostasis levels that can have detrimental effects on cell function and survival. Although studies have shown that Aβ can interfere with various Ca2+ fluxes, the complexity of these interactions remains elusive. We have constructed a mathematical model that simulates Ca2+ patterns under the influence of Aβ. Our simulations shows that Aβ can increase regions of mixed-mode oscillations leading to aberrant signals under various conditions. We investigate how Aβ affects individual flux contributions through inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptors, ryanodine receptors, and membrane pores. We demonstrate that controlling for the ryanodine receptor’s maximal kinetic reaction rate may provide a biophysical way of managing aberrant Ca2+ signals. The influence of a dynamic model for IP3 production is also investigated under various conditions as well as the impact of changes in membrane potential.

The objective of this study was to validate a new method of beef marbling evaluation by image analysis. The new assessment was compared with two known marbling measurements: chemical IMF and USDA scores. Moreover, the relationship between marbling measurements and other meat quality parameters was investigated. Samples of Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle were obtained from carcasses of 39 Italian crossbred heifers and 62 Angus bred heifers, that underwent two different dietary treatments. The use of various breeds and diets was chosen to obtain different intramuscular fat levels, in order to validate the use of Image J software for the analysis of different type of beef meat. The images of fresh cuts were appraised by experienced beef graders, and the samples were used to determine fat content by chemical Soxhlet extraction. Carcasses measurements according to the EUROP system, and other physical meat proprieties were also assessed. The results demonstrated that the marbling measurements obtained by computer image analysis, such as the number of marbling particles, the average particle size (mm), and the percentage of marbling particles (%), significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with USDA scores and IMF content. Moreover, the principal component analysis (PCA) showed three principal meat components, identified as 1) color, 2) fat, and 3) water release. The second principal component (PC) explained 24.94% of variance, and was positively correlated with image analysis measures, USDA score, and IMF, while negatively correlated with the Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF)."
https://openalex.org/W2888661020,"Global water shortage is becoming increasingly severe, so the identification and protection of potential areas for harvesting water play important roles in alleviating drought. Suitable sites for potential water harvesting require a high runoff potential. Avoiding soil erosion caused by high surface runoff, however, is also necessary. We therefore developed a procedure for the continuous accounting of runoff potential based on the Soil Conservation Service curve number and potential risks of water and soil loss based on the universal soil loss equation to evaluate the potential for water harvesting. Suitable sites for rainwater harvesting covered 24.90% of the semi-arid area of Chifeng, southeastern Inner Mongolia, China. The best areas accounted for 8.4% of the study area. The southern part of the Greater Hinggnan Mountains in northern Chifeng had a large rainwater harvesting area, and the western and eastern parts of the Chifeng area belonging to Horqin Sandy Land and Hunshandake Sandy Land, respectively, had smaller rainwater-harvesting areas. The eight reservoirs in the Xilamulun River Basin were further analyzed as an example. Derived sites investigated by ground-truth field verification indicated a method accuracy of 87.5%. This methodology could be effective in other areas with similar requirements due to the increasing demand for water resources and requirements for the protection of soil-water resources."

The problem addressed is clustering the cities, then using the NEH heuristic, which provides an initial solution that is refined using a modification of the metaheuristic Multi-Restart Iterated Local Search MRSILS; finally, clusters are joined to end the route with the minimum distance to the travelling salesman problem. The contribution of this research is the use of the metaheuristic MRSILS, that in our knowledge had not been used to solve the travelling salesman problem using clusters. The main objective of this article is to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than Genetic Algorithms when clusters are used. To demonstrate the above, both algorithms are compared with some cases taken from the literature, also a comparison with the best-known results is done. In addition, statistical studies are made in the same conditions to demonstrate this fact. Our method obtains better results in all the 10 cases compared."
https://openalex.org/W2888047066,"Objective Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are the treatment of choice for central precocious puberty (CPP) and have been widely used for several decades. We determined the effect of GnRHa treatment on the auxological outcomes of girls with idiopathic CPP. Methods This study included 84 girls treated monthly with depot leuprolide acetate who had reached adult height. We compared their final adult height (FAH) with their initial predicted adult height (PAH). We performed a multivariate analysis of the factors associated with FAH on all girls diagnosed with CPP. Results We performed the final evaluations at a mean age of 14.1 ± 0.8 years after a mean treatment duration of 2.98 ± 0.73 years (ranging from 1.5–4.8 years). Menarche had occurred at 12.6 ± 0.6 years of age, which was 16.5 ± 6.1 months after discontinuation of GnRHa therapy. Mean FAH was 160.1 ± 5.0 cm, which was significantly higher than the initial PAH (156.1 ± 5.7 cm; P < 0.001). To investigate whether growth outcomes were influenced by the age at initial treatment, we divided all patients into two groups, those treated between 6 and 8 years (n = 23) and those treated after 8 years (n = 61); no significant differences were observed in FAH between the two groups. FAH was significantly and positively correlated with the height standard deviation score (SDS) at the end of treatment and with the target height, whereas the difference between bone age and chronological age at the start and end of treatment was negatively correlated with FAH. Conclusion FAH was significantly higher than the initial PAH in girls with CPP who were treated with GnRHa. Also, GnRHa treatment was still effective even after 8 years of age in girls with CPP."
https://openalex.org/W2888362897,"Background Electrophysiological studies in mice, the prevailing model organism in the field of basic cardiovascular research, are impeded by the low yield of programmed electrical stimulation (PES). Objective To investigate a modified approach for ventricular arrhythmia (VA) induction and a novel scoring system in mice. Method A systematic review of literature on current methods for PES in mice searching the PubMed database revealed that VA inducibility was low and ranged widely (4.6 ± 10.7%). Based on this literature review, a modified PES protocol with 3 to 10 extrastimuli was developed and tested in comparison to the conventional PES protocol using up to 3 extrastimuli in anesthetized wildtype mice (C57BL/6J, n = 12). Induced VA, classified according to the Lambeth Convention, were assessed by established arrhythmia scores as well as a novel arrhythmia score based on VA duration. Results PES with the modified approach raised both the occurrence and the duration of VA compared to conventional PES (0% vs 50%; novel VA score p = 0.0002). Particularly, coupling of >6 extrastimuli raised the induction of VA. Predominantly, premature ventricular complexes (n = 6) and ventricular tachycardia <1s (n = 4) were observed. Repeated PES after adrenergic stimulation using isoprenaline resulted in enhanced induction of ventricular tachycardia <1s in both protocols. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the presented approach of modified PES enables effective induction and quantification of VA in wildtype mice and may well be suited to document and evaluate detailed VA characteristics in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2888083745,"Zika virus has created a major epidemic in Central and South America, especially in Brazil, during 2015-16. The infection is strongly associated with fetal malformations, mainly microcephaly, and neurological symptoms in adults. During the preparation of the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in 2016, members of Olympic Delegations worldwide expressed their concern about the health consequences of being infected with Zika virus. A major risk highlighted by the scientific community was the impact on the spreading of the virus into new territories immediately after the Games.To detect real-time incidence of symptoms compatible with arboviral diseases and other tropical imported diseases among the Spanish Olympic Delegation (SOD) attending the Rio Olympic Games in 2016.We developed a surveillance platform based on a mobile application installed in participant's smartphones that monitored the health status of the SOD through a daily interactive check of the user health status including geo-localization data. The results were evaluated by a study physician on-call through a web-based platform monitoring system. Participants presenting severe symptoms or those compatible with Zika infection prompted an alarm in the system triggering specialized medical assistance and allowing early detection and control of the introduction of arboviral diseases in Spain.The system was downloaded by 189 participants and used by 143 of them (76%). Median age was 38 years (IQR 16), and 134 (71%) were male. Mean duration of travel was 19 days (+/-9SD). During the Games the highest accumulated incidence observed was for headache: 6.06% cough: 5.30% and conjunctivitis: 3.03%. The incidence rate of cough during the Olympic Games was 1.1% per day per person, followed by headache 0.8% and 0.4% conjunctivitis or diarrhea. In our cohort we observed that non-athletes experienced more incidence of symptoms, except for incidence of cough which was the same in the two groups (1.1%). No participants reported symptoms fulfilling Zika definition case.Our system did not find cases fulfilling Zika definition amongst participants of the SOD during the Games, consistent with limited cases of Zika in Rio during the Games. The app showed good usability and the web based monitoring platform allowed to manage infectious cases in real-time. The overall system has proven to serve as a real-time surveillance platform for detecting symptoms that could be present in tropical imported diseases, especially arboviral diseases, contributing to the preparedness for the introduction of vector borne-diseases in non-endemic countries."
https://openalex.org/W2888267368,"As reported by the Taiwan Cancer Registry in 2013 squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck cancer (HNSCC) was the sixth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the 5th most common cause of cancer related death and its incidence and mortality rate is still rising. The co-occurrence of HNSCC and secondary primary cancer (SPC) and the chemopreventive effect of aspirin on certain malignancies had been reported. Therefore we conducted this national study to investigate the use of aspirin associated with risk reduction of secondary primary cancer for patients with head and neck cancer in Taiwan. We searched the Registry for Catastrophic Illness in the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) for 18,234 patients (3,576 aspirin users and 14,667 non-aspirin users) diagnosed with HNSCC during 2000–2005. The SPC incidence density during follow-up in 2000–2011 was compared between the groups. For HNSCC patients, aspirin use after diagnosis was significantly associated with SPC risk reduction by 25% (adjusted HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63–0.89; p = 0.001) after multivariate analysis. In the subgroup analysis, we found that esophageal cancer and stomach cancer incidence were significantly reduced after aspirin use (adjusted HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41–0.90; p = 0.01 for esophageal cancer; adjusted HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08–0.87; p = 0.03 for stomach cancer). Aspirin use for 1–3 years was associated with SPC risk reduction by 35% (adjusted HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49–0.87; p = 0.003). SPC risk reduction extended continuously for more than 3 years of follow up (adjusted HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53–0.98; p = 0.030). Our data shows aspirin use was associated with reduced SPC incidence for HNSCC patients, attributed mainly to reduced risk of esophageal and stomach cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2888707278,"Canopy fragmentation increases both spatial heterogeneity and patch edges which, in turn, is then likely to modify the local hydrodynamics in the canopy. The orientation of the edge versus the wave and current field is also expected to play an important role in determining wave attenuation and sheltering at the edge of a canopy. We investigated the effect a longitudinal edge (i.e. with its main axis aligned to wave direction) of a simulated canopy has on local edge hydrodynamics. The effect that both canopy density and flexibility have on the hydrodynamics was studied. Flexible plants reduced the wave velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy with distance into the canopy and this attenuation increased as the density of the canopy increased. Compared to flexible plants, an edge of rigid plants produced a higher wave velocity attenuation coupled with an increase in the turbulent kinetic energy with distance into the canopy despite having the same canopy density. This greater wave attenuation at the edge coincided with the shifting of the associated mean current that, in turn, produced an increase in the turbulent kinetic energy at the edge in the canopy. The effect was accentuated when the canopy density increased. The wave velocity attenuation was a linear function of the canopy cover. While flexible plants reduced the turbulent kinetic energy following a linear function of the canopy cover, rigid canopies increased the turbulent kinetic energy following a linear function of the canopy cover. In the case of the flexible vegetation, the lengths of both the inner and outer canopy boundary layers increased as the canopy cover increased."
https://openalex.org/W2888087655,"One of the most important limitations of genetic testing in preimplantation embryos is embryonic mosaicism, especially when performed on D3 with only a single blastomere evaluated. Previous publications, using Array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (a-CGH) to compare day 3 (D3) biopsies versus trophectoderm biopsies for the analysis of aneuploid embryos, showed similar high concordance rates per embryo diagnosis for D3 biopsies and trophectoderm biopsies. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was introduced lately as a new technique for preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A). Using this technique, this retrospective descriptive study evaluated the degree of the concordance of the diagnosis between preimplantation human cleavage stage (D3) and blastocyst stage (D5) embryos. Double biopsies on D3 and D5 were performed on 118 embryos, reaching blastocyst stage on D5 and had not been selected for transfer. As the fertilization law of the United Arab Emirates does not allow embryo freezing, also surplus euploid embryos after D 3 biopsy were included. Analysis of the NGS results from D3 and D5 embryo biopsies showed a total concordance rate per embryo diagnosis of 85.6% for euploid and aneuploid embryos. The concordance rates per embryo chromosomal pattern for embryo diagnosed as aneuploid at both biopsy stages was 82.2%. However, the status regarding the affected chromosomes was not identical on D3 and D5. Hence, the total concordance rate between D3 biopsy and D5 biopsy was limited to 67.8%. This current study clearly demonstrated that the concordance rates between D3 and D5 biopsies in aneuploid and euploid embryos are lower than previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W2888125165,"Mainly recognized for their cognitive performance, the visual communication system and, particularly, the potential function of facial displays in parrots remain thus far unexplored. Here, we provide the first descriptive study of facial display use in captive blue-and-yellow macaws. We observed the feather position (sleeked or ruffled) on the crown, nape and cheek at the group level during the macaws’ daily routine and individually while interacting with a familiar animal caretaker. In the latter context, blushing was also assessed on the bare skin of the cheek. Group level observations showed that crown, nape and cheek feathers ruffling was more frequent in activities requiring no locomotion than in activities requiring locomotion. With the animal caretaker, crown ruffling was significantly more frequent when the caretaker was actively engaging with the parrot than during a control phase with no mutual interaction. In addition, a significantly higher proportion of naïve observers judged blushing as being present on photographs taken during the mutual interaction phase than during the control phase. We thus showed significant variations in facial displays and bare skin colour based on the birds’ social context and activity. Our results broaden the scope for further studies to determine whether parrots’ faces provide visual social signals."
https://openalex.org/W2888379448,"Inosine monophosphate (IMP) is a key factor affecting the fleshy flavor of meat; meanwhile, the free-range mode is an efficient strategy to improve muscular IMP content. To assess expression differences in IMP metabolism-related genes under different feeding patterns, Illumina Nextseq 500 sequencing was used to catalog the global gene expression profiles of muscle samples from Lueyang black-bone chicken under free-range and caging conditions. A total of 15510 unigenes were assembled, with 13423 (86.54%) and 6088 (39.25%) unigenes correctly annotated in the GO and KOG databases, respectively. Next, the ""purine metabolism"" pathway in the ""nucleotide metabolism group"" was assessed in depth. Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, we retrieved 172 nucleotide- and 5 purine- metabolism related genes that were differentially expressed in muscle samples from free-range and caged chickens. At 60-day-old, AMPD1, NT5C1A and ENTPD8 showed higher levels in the free-range group, while only ENTPD8 was upregulated in 120-day-old chickens. In addition, GART, GARS and ADSL in free-range chickens showed higher levels compared with caged animals. Furthermore, IMPDH levels in free-range chicken were lower than those of caged chicken. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to validate the above findings. These results revealed a set of differentially expressed genes potentially related to IMP metabolism in chicken under different breeding modes, providing novel insights into controlling IMP levels in chicken meat."
https://openalex.org/W2888685648,"Background and objective Markov micro-simulation models are being increasingly used in health economic evaluations. An important feature of the Markov micro-simulation model is its ability to consider transition probabilities of heterogeneous subgroups with different risk profiles. A survival analysis is generally performed to accurately estimate the transition probabilities associated with the risk profiles. This study aimed to apply a flexible parametric survival model (FPSM) to estimate individual transition probabilities. Materials and methods The data were obtained from a cohort study investigating ischemic stroke outcomes in Western China. In total, 585 subjects were included in the analysis. To explore the goodness of fit of the FPSM, we compared the estimated hazard ratios and baseline cumulative hazards, both of which are necessary to the calculate individual transition probabilities, and the Markov micro-simulation models constructed using the FPSM and Cox model to determine the validity of the two Markov micro-simulation models and cost-effectiveness results. Results The flexible parametric proportional hazards model produced hazard ratio and baseline cumulative hazard estimates that were similar to those obtained using the Cox proportional hazards model. The simulated cumulative incidence of recurrent ischemic stroke and 5-years cost-effectiveness of Incremental cost-effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) were also similar using the two approaches. A discrepancy in the results was evident between the 5-years cost-effectiveness and the 10-years cost-effectiveness of ICERs, which were approximately 0.9 million (China Yuan) and 0.5 million (China Yuan), respectively. Conclusions The flexible parametric survival model represents a good approach for estimating individual transition probabilities for a Markov micro-simulation model."
https://openalex.org/W2768153492,"The increasing cost of electoral campaigns raises the need for effective campaign planning and a precise understanding of the return of such investment. Interestingly, despite the strong impact of elections on our daily lives, how this investment is translated into votes is still unknown. By performing data analysis and modeling, we show that top candidates spend more money \emph{per vote} than the less successful and poorer candidates, a sublinearity that discloses a diseconomy of scale. We demonstrate that such electoral diseconomy arises from the competition between candidates due to inefficient campaign expenditure. Our approach succeeds in two important tests. First, it reveals that the statistical pattern in the vote distribution of candidates can be explained in terms of the independently conceived, but similarly skewed distribution of money campaign. Second, using a heuristic argument, we are able to predict a turnout percentage for a given election of approximately 63\%. This result is in good agreement with the average turnout rate obtained from real data. Due to its generality, we expect that our approach can be applied to a wide range of problems concerning the adoption process in marketing campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W2888136942,"With the rise in prevalence of non-communicable diseases in India and Kerala in particular, efforts to develop lifestyle interventions have increased. However, contextualised interventions are limited. We developed and implemented contextualised behavioural intervention strategies focusing on household dietary behaviours in selected rural areas in Kerala and conducted a community-based pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial to assess its effectiveness to increase the intake of fruits and vegetables at individual level, and the procurement of fruits and vegetables at the household level and reduce the consumption of salt, sugar and oil at the household level.Six out of 22 administrative units in the northern part of Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala state were selected as geographic boundaries and randomized to either intervention or control arms. Stratified sampling was carried out and 30 clusters comprising 6-11 households were selected in each arm. A cluster was defined as a neighbourhood group functioning in rural areas under a state-sponsored community-based network (Kudumbasree). We screened 1237 households and recruited 479 (intervention: 240; control: 239) households and individuals (male or female aged 25-45 years) across the 60 clusters. 471 households and individuals completed the intervention and end-line survey and one was excluded due to pregnancy. Interventions were delivered for a period of one-year at household level at 0, 6, and 12 months, including counselling sessions, telephonic reminders, home visits and general awareness sessions through the respective neighbourhood groups in the intervention arm. Households in the control arm received general dietary information leaflets. Data from 478 households (239 in each arm) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, with the household as the unit of analysis.There was significant, modest increase in fruit intake from baseline in the intervention arm (12.5%); but no significant impact of the intervention on vegetable intake over the control arm. There was a significant increase in vegetable procurement in the intervention arm compared to the control arm with the actual effect size showing an overall increase by19%; 34% of all households in the intervention arm had increased their procurement by at least 20%, compared to 17% in the control arm. Monthly household consumption of salt, sugar and oil was greatly reduced in the intervention arm compared to the control arm with the actual effect sizes showing an overall reduction by 45%, 40% and 48% respectively.The intervention enabled significant reduction in salt, sugar and oil consumption and improvement in fruit and vegetable procurement at the household level in the intervention arm. However, there was a disconnect between the demonstrated increase in FV procurement and the lack of increase in FV intake. We need to explore fruit and vegetable intake behaviour further to identify strategies or components that would have made a difference. We can take forward the lessons learned from this study to improve our understanding of human dietary behaviour and how that can be changed to improve health within this context."
https://openalex.org/W2888225292,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4, is prevalent in all human populations. EBV mainly infects human B lymphocytes and epithelial cells, and is therefore associated with their various malignancies. To unravel the cellular mechanisms during the infection, we constructed interspecies networks to investigate the molecular cross-talk mechanisms between human B cells and EBV at the first (0-24 hours) and second (8-72 hours) stages of EBV infection. We first constructed a candidate genome-wide interspecies genetic-and-epigenetic network (the candidate GIGEN) by big database mining. We then pruned false positives in the candidate GIGEN to obtain the real GIGENs at the first and second infection stages in the lytic phase by their corresponding next-generation sequencing data through dynamic interaction models, the system identification approach, and the system order detection method. The real GIGENs are very complex and comprise protein-protein interaction networks, gene/microRNA (miRNA)/long non-coding RNA regulation networks, and host-virus cross-talk networks. To understand the molecular cross-talk mechanisms underlying EBV infection, we extracted the core GIGENs including host-virus core networks and host-virus core pathways from the real GIGENs using the principal network projection method. According to the results, we found that the activities of epigenetics-associated human proteins or genes were initially inhibited by viral proteins and miRNAs, and human immune responses were then dysregulated by epigenetic modification. We suggested that EBV exploits viral proteins and miRNAs, such as EBNA1, BPLF1, BALF3, BVRF1 and miR-BART14, to develop its defensive mechanism to defeat multiple immune attacks by the human immune system, promotes virion production, and facilitates the transportation of viral particles by activating the human genes NRP1 and CLIC5. Ultimately, we propose a therapeutic intervention comprising thymoquinone, valpromide, and zebularine to act as inhibitors of EBV-associated malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2888270920,"Activities of ecosystem engineers can interact with other disturbances to modulate rates of key processes such as productivity and nutrient cycling. Bioturbation, movement of soil by organisms, is a widespread form of ecosystem engineering in terrestrial ecosystems. We propose that bioturbation by southeastern pocket gophers (Geomys pinetis), an abundant but declining ecosystem engineer in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests, accelerates nutrient dynamics of the forest floor by burying litter and then reduces litter consumption and nitrogen (N) volatilization losses in the presence of fire. We evaluated our hypothesis by measuring how litter burial alters decomposition and N and phosphorus (P) turnover of longleaf pine and turkey oak (Quercus laevis Walt.) litter over four years, and then simulated interactive ecosystem-level effects of litter burial and low-intensity fires on N and P dynamics of the litter layer. In the field, mass loss was over two times greater and N and P were released much more rapidly from litter buried beneath mounds than on the surface of the forest floor. At a measured rate of mound formation covering 2.3 ± 0.6% of the forest floor per year, litter mass and N and P content of the forest floor simulated over an eight-year period were approximately 11% less than amounts in areas without pocket gopher mounds. In contrast to unburied litter, litter beneath mounds is protected from consumption during fires, and as fire interval increased, consumption rates decreased because mounds cover more years of accumulated litter. Our research indicates that bioturbation and burial of litter by pocket gophers accelerates turnover of N and P on the forest floor, and in the presence of fire, conserves N in this ecosystem where productivity is known to be nutrient limited."

https://openalex.org/W2888680218,"Background Patients on dialysis are in a chronic carnitine-deficient state. This condition may be associated with abnormalities of the fatty acid and organic acid metabolisms. Carnitine is required for β-oxidation of the long-chain fatty acids; therefore, carnitine deficiency decreases the efficiency of ATP synthesis and may incur death. However, the details of this association remain unknown. We examined the relationship between β-oxidation efficiency represented by the carnitine profile and 4-year all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients. Methods The carnitine profiles of 122 hemodialysis patients were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The associations between the 4-year all-cause mortality and carnitine profile as well as the clinical backgrounds of the patients were investigated. A survival analysis was conducted by the Kaplan–Meier survival method and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis. The bootstrap method was performed to confirm the stability and robustness of our model. Results Of the 122 subjects analyzed, 111 were selected and 24 died during the observation period. Stepwise multivariable Cox regression demonstrated that diabetes state [Hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 4.981 (2.107–11.77)], age [HR (95% CI), 1.052 (1.014–1.091)], and the acetylcarnitine/(palmitoylcarnitine+octadecenoylcarnitine) [C2/(C16+C18:1)] ratio [HR (95% CI), 0.937 (0.904–0.971)] were independent significant factors of 4-year all-cause mortality. The bootstrap method confirmed the significance of these three factors. Conclusion The 4-year all-cause mortality negatively correlated with the C2/(C16+C18:1) ratio. Improvement of the impaired β-oxidation state after L-carnitine administration may ameliorate prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2888187041,"Flattening of coiled shells has occurred in several gastropod lineages, while the evolutionary process of shell flattening is little known. The subfamily Fossarininae of the top shell family (Trochidae) is unique, because it includes four genera at various stages of shell flattening. Broderipia and Roya, have zygomorphic shells that has lost coiling, while the sister genera, Fossarina and Synaptocochlea, have respectively turbiniform and auriform shells. Therefore, comparisons of biology, habitats and detailed morphology among these four genera may help us to detect selection pressure driving shell flattening and loss of coiling. Although Broderipia has recently been identified as living symbiotically in the pits of sea urchins, the habitats and biology of the other three Fossarininae species, especially Roya are poorly known. After an extensive search on rocky shores of the Japanese Archipelago, we found live Roya eximia snails on intertidal/subtidal rock surfaces exposed to strong waves. Roya snails crept on the bare rock surface to graze periphyton at low tide, and fled into vacant barnacle shells at high tide. Comparison of the morphology of soft bodies in Fossarininae revealed that the columellar muscle of flattened species has been drastically elongated and arranged in posterior semi-outer edge of the flattened shell as observed in true limpets. The flattering and loss of coiling of the shell in Roya caused acquisition of a zygomorphic flat body, retraction of coiled visceral mass, and expansion of the foot sole. All of these changes improved tolerance against strong waves and the ability to cling to rock surfaces, and thus enabled a lifestyle utilizing both wave-swept rock surfaces and the inside of vacant barnacle shells."

This exploratory study aimed to investigate the effects of three days of dry immersion (DI) on sensory thresholds and the functioning of lemniscal pathways, assessed by somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs).Twelve healthy male volunteers (32+/-4.8 years) participated in the study. Sensory thresholds and SEPs of the tibial nerve of both limbs were recorded before (D-1) and on the third day of dry immersion (D3).Sensory thresholds significantly decreased on D3 (-20.75 +/-21.7%; z = -2.54; p = 0.0109 on the right side and -22.18+/-17.28%; z = -3.059; p = 0.002 on the left side). The amplitude of P40 responses did not differ between D-1 and D3. Latencies of all central responses until P30 were shortened on D3 (N21 right:-0.57+/-0.31; z = -3.06; p = 0.002; N21 left -0.83+/-0.53; z = -2.94; p = 0.003; P30 right: -1.26+/-1.42; z = -3.059; p = 0.002; P30 left: -1.11+/-1.55; z = -2.27; p = 0.02).Three days of dry immersion can induce hyperexcitability of lemniscal pathways.This may be explained by a change in the expression of membrane channels and/or medullar plasticity and/or hypersensitization of peripheral sensory receptors induced by this acute deafferentation. Additional studies are needed to further elucidate the mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2888206849,"Collaboration among scientists has a major influence on scientific progress. Such collaboration often results from scientific meetings, where scientists gather to present and discuss their research and to meet potential collaborators. However, most scientific meetings have inherent biases, such as the availability of research funding or the selection bias of professional societies that make it difficult to study the effect of the meeting per se on scientific productivity. To evaluate the effects of scientific meetings on collaboration and progress independent of these biases, we conducted a study of the annual symposia held by the International Milk Genomics Consortium (IMGC) over a 12-year period. In our study, we conducted permutation testing to analyze the effectiveness of the IMGC in facilitating collaboration and productivity in a community of milk scientists who were meeting attendees relative to non-attendees. Using the number of co-authorships on published papers as a measure of collaboration, our analysis revealed that scientists who attended the symposium were associated with more collaboration than were scientists who did not attend. Furthermore, we evaluated the scientific progress of consortium attendees by analyzing publication rate and article impact. We found that IMGC attendees, in addition to being more collaborative, were also more productive and influential than were non-attendees who published in the same field. The results of our study suggest that the annual symposium encouraged interactions among disparate scientists and increased research productivity, exemplifying the positive effect of scientific meetings on both collaboration and progress."
https://openalex.org/W2888680515,"The phylogeographic structure of insect species in North America is poorly understood. The moth family Sesiidae (Lepidoptera) contains many economically important pests of agriculture and forestry, as well as beneficial species used in biological control. Despite their significance, this study constitutes the first broad-ranging population genetic study on North American sesiids. It probes the population structure of eight species of sesiid moths based on sequence variation in cytochrome c oxidase I (N = 191). Haplotype diversity levels were high in seven of the eight species, while nucleotide diversity varied considerably. Patterns ranged from limited structure and a starburst pattern in the raspberry crown borer Pennisetia marginata to highly geographically structured populations in the peachtree borer Synanthedon exitiosa and the maple callus borer Synanthedon acerni. These varied patterns suggest differing evolutionary histories and dispersal abilities. By elucidating population genetic structure and barriers to dispersal we can begin to devise conservation and management plans."
https://openalex.org/W2888180899,"Predicting the fate of chloroethenes in groundwater is essential when evaluating remediation strategies. Such predictions are expected to be more accurate when incorporating isotopic parameters. Although secondary chlorine isotope effects have been observed during reductive dechlorination of chloroethenes, development of modelling frameworks and simulation has thus far been limited. We have developed a novel mathematical framework to simulate the C/Cl isotopic fractionation during reductive dechlorination of chloroethenes. This framework differs from the existing state of the art by incorporating secondary isotopic effects and considering both C and Cl isotopes simultaneously. A comprehensive general model (GM), which is expected to be the closest representation of reality thus far investigated, was implemented. A less computationally intensive simplified model (SM), with the potential for use in modelling of complex reactive transport scenarios, was subsequently validated based on its comparison to GM. The approach of GM considers all isotopocules (i.e. molecules differing in number and position of heavy and light isotopes) of each chloroethene as individual species, of which each is degraded at a different rate. Both models GM and SM simulated plausible C/Cl isotopic compositions of tetrachloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE) and cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) during sequential dechlorination when using experimentally relevant kinetic and isotopic parameters. The only major difference occurred in the case where different secondary isotopic effects occur at the different non-reacting positions when PCE is dechlorinated down to cDCE. This observed discrepancy stems from the unequal Cl isotope distribution in TCE that arises due to the occurrence of differential secondary Cl isotopic effects during transformation of PCE to TCE. Additionally, these models are shown to accurately reproduce experimental data obtained during reductive dechlorination by bacterial enrichments harbouring Sulfurospirillum spp. where secondary isotope effects are known to have occurred. These findings underscore a promising future for the development of reactive transport models that incorporate isotopic parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2888522544,"Neisserial heparin binding antigen (NHBA) is one of three main recombinant protein antigens in 4CMenB, a vaccine for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. NHBA is a surface-exposed lipoprotein composed of a predicted disordered N-terminal region, an arginine-rich region that binds heparin, and a C-terminal domain that folds as an anti-parallel β-barrel and that upon release after cleavage by human proteases alters endothelial permeability. NHBA induces bactericidal antibodies in humans, and NHBA-specific antibodies elicited by the 4CMenB vaccine contribute to serum bactericidal activity, the correlate of protection. To better understand the structural bases of the human antibody response to 4CMenB vaccination and to inform antigen design, we used X-ray crystallography to elucidate the structures of two C-terminal fragments of NHBA, either alone or in complex with the Fab derived from the vaccine-elicited human monoclonal antibody 5H2, and the structure of the unbound Fab 5H2. The structures reveal details on the interaction between an N-terminal β-hairpin fragment and the β-barrel, and explain how NHBA is capable of generating cross-reactive antibodies through an extensive conserved conformational epitope that covers the entire C-terminal face of the β-barrel. By providing new structural information on a vaccine antigen and on the human immune response to vaccination, these results deepen our molecular understanding of 4CMenB, and might also aid future vaccine design projects."
https://openalex.org/W2888652645,"Purpose To use and test a new method of inducing endogenously generated pupillary oscillations (POs) in patients with unilateral optic neuritis (ON), to describe a signal analysis approach quantifying pupil activity and to evaluate the extent to which POs permit to discriminate patients from control participants. Method Pupil size was recorded with an eye-tracker and converted in real time to modulate the luminance of a stimulus (a 20° disk) presented in front of participants. With this biofeedback setting, an increasing pupil size transforms into a high luminance, entraining a pupil constriction that in turn decreases the stimulus luminance, and so on, resulting in endogenously generated POs. POs were recorded for 30 seconds in the affected eye, in the fellow eye and in binocular conditions with 22 patients having a history of unilateral ON within a period of 5 years, and with 22 control participants. Different signal analysis methods were used to quantify the power and frequency of POs. Results On average, pupil size oscillated at around 1 Hz. The amplitude of POs appears not to be a reliable marker of ON. In contrast, the frequency of POs was significantly lower, and was more variable over time, in the patients’ affected eye, as compared to their fellow eye and to the binocular condition. No such differences were found in control participants. Receiver operating characteristic analyses based on the frequency and the variability of POs to classify patients and control participants gave an area under the curve of 0.82, a sensitivity of 82% (95%CI: 60%-95%) and a specificity of 77% (95%CI: 55%-92%). Conclusions The new method used to induce POs allowed characterizing the visual afferent pathway defect in ON patients with encouraging accuracy. The method was fast, easy to use, only requiring that participants look ahead, and allows testing many stimulus parameters (e.g. color, stimulus location, size, etc)."
https://openalex.org/W2888593459,"Case-control Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) provide a rich resource for studying the genetic architecture of complex diseases. A key is to elucidate how the genetic effects vary by the environment, what is traditionally defined by Gene-Environment interactions (GxE). The overlooked complication is that multiple, distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms may lead to the same clinical diagnosis and often these mechanisms have distinct genetic bases. In this paper, we first show that using the clinically diagnosed status can lead to severely biased estimates of GxE interactions in situations when the frequency of the pathologic diagnosis of interest, as compared to other diagnoses, depends on the environment. We then propose a pseudo-likelihood solution to correct the bias. Finally, we demonstrate our method in extensive simulations and in a GWAS of Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2888046653,"Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that mediate ion transport across biological membranes. Ion channel function is traditionally characterized by electrical parameters acquired with techniques such as patch-clamping and reconstitution in lipid bilayer membranes (BLM) that provide relevant information such as ionic conductance, selectivity, and gating properties. High resolution structural information of ion channels however, requires independent technologies, of which atomic force microscopy (AFM) is the only one that provides topological features of single functional channel proteins in their native environments. To date practically no data exist on direct correlations between electrical features and topological parameters from functional single channel complexes. Here, we report the design and construction of a BLM reconstitution microchamber that supports the simultaneous recording of electrical currents and AFM imaging from single channel complexes. As proof-of-principle, we tested the technique on polycystin-2 (PC2, TRPP2), a TRP channel family member from which we had previously elucidated its tetrameric topology by AFM imaging, and single channel currents by the BLM technique. The experimental setup provided direct structural-functional correlates from PC2 single channel complexes that disclosed novel topological changes between the closed and open sub-conductance states of the functional channel, namely, an inverse correlation between conductance and height of the channel. Unexpectedly, we also disclosed intrinsic PC2 mechanosensitivity in response to external forces. The platform provides a suitable means of accessing topological information to correlate with ion channel electrical parameters essential to understand the physiology of these transmembrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2888317258,"Racial segregation, and in particular school segregation, likely plays an important role in affecting health outcomes. To examine this connection, this paper explores the relationship between the end of court-ordered school desegregation and preterm births among Blacks using birth certificate information between 1992 and 2002 (n = 183,178). The end of court-ordered oversight has important implications for the level of racial segregation in schools: If residential segregation remains high, neighborhood-based student assignment plans would naturally increase school segregation. A rise in school segregation may lead to worse educational, labor, and health outcomes among Blacks. Using multiple difference-in-differences framework that exploits variation in exposure to schools that declared unitary status, it finds that school districts’ release from court oversight is associated with a 0.8 percentage point increase in preterm births among Black mothers. This paper contributes to literature that finds that the end of court-ordered school desegregation in the 1990s have negative implications for Blacks. More research should be conducted to understand the causal relationship between school segregation and infant health."
https://openalex.org/W2888134441,"Individual decisions are often made simultaneously under social influence and acute stress, yet despite its importance, it has been largely unknown how stress influences the weight which people place on others’ decisions. To answer this I ran a laboratory experiment where 140 subjects were exposed to an acute stressor or a control procedure, immediately before and after which we tested their behavior in a simple Bayesian-updating task. Using three measures (cortisol, heart-rate and mood questionnaire) I show that subjects in the treatment group were under considerable levels of stress. Although stress was expected to increase the weight they put on information coming from the observation of others, I see no effect of stress on subjects’ behavior, either after private or public signals, or on the precision of the updating behavior. This holds across different specifications and after the addition of various personal controls, including the Big-Five personality traits and the psychological measure of conformity."
