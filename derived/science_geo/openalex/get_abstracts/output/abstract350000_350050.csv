https://openalex.org/W2066521860,"Recent advances in far-field fluorescence microscopy have led to substantial improvements in image resolution, achieving a near-molecular resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the two lateral dimensions. Three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenge. We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures."
https://openalex.org/W2105230781,"HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1-3) are oxygen sensors that regulate the stability of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in an oxygen-dependent manner. Here, we show that loss of Phd1 lowers oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle by reprogramming glucose metabolism from oxidative to more anaerobic ATP production through activation of a Pparalpha pathway. This metabolic adaptation to oxygen conservation impairs oxidative muscle performance in healthy conditions, but it provides acute protection of myofibers against lethal ischemia. Hypoxia tolerance is not due to HIF-dependent angiogenesis, erythropoiesis or vasodilation, but rather to reduced generation of oxidative stress, which allows Phd1-deficient myofibers to preserve mitochondrial respiration. Hypoxia tolerance relies primarily on Hif-2alpha and was not observed in heterozygous Phd2-deficient or homozygous Phd3-deficient mice. Of medical importance, conditional knockdown of Phd1 also rapidly induces hypoxia tolerance. These findings delineate a new role of Phd1 in hypoxia tolerance and offer new treatment perspectives for disorders characterized by oxidative stress."

https://openalex.org/W2042839347,"A switch in specificity of avian influenza A viruses' hemagglutinin (HA) from avian-like (alpha2-3 sialylated glycans) to human-like (alpha2-6 sialylated glycans) receptors is believed to be associated with their adaptation to infect humans. We show that a characteristic structural topology--and not the alpha2-6 linkage itself--enables specific binding of HA to alpha2-6 sialylated glycans and that recognition of this topology may be critical for adaptation of HA to bind glycans in the upper respiratory tract of humans. An integrated biochemical, analytical and data mining approach demonstrates that HAs from the human-adapted H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, but not H5N1 (bird flu) viruses, specifically bind to long alpha2-6 sialylated glycans with this topology. This could explain why H5N1 viruses have not yet gained a foothold in the human population. Our findings will enable the development of additional strategies for effective surveillance and potential therapeutic interventions for H5N1 and possibly other influenza A viruses."

With the use of an optical-trapping assay based on in situ transcription by a molecule of RNA polymerase, single nascent RNAs containing pbuE adenine riboswitch aptamers were unfolded and refolded. Multiple folding states were characterized by means of both force-extension curves and folding trajectories under constant force by measuring the molecular contour length, kinetics, and energetics with and without adenine. Distinct folding steps correlated with the formation of key secondary or tertiary structures and with ligand binding. Adenine-induced stabilization of the weakest helix in the aptamer, the mechanical switch underlying regulatory action, was observed directly. These results provide an integrated view of hierarchical folding in an aptamer, demonstrating how complex folding can be resolved into constituent parts, and supply further insights into tertiary structure formation."
https://openalex.org/W2106995317,"Fundamental processes influencing human growth can be revealed by studying extreme short stature. Using genetic linkage analysis, we find that biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the centrosomal pericentrin ( PCNT ) gene on chromosome 21q22.3 cause microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II) in 25 patients. Adults with this rare inherited condition have an average height of 100 centimeters and a brain size comparable to that of a 3-month-old baby, but are of near-normal intelligence. Absence of PCNT results in disorganized mitotic spindles and missegregation of chromosomes. Mutations in related genes are known to cause primary microcephaly ( MCPH1, CDK5RAP2, ASPM , and CENPJ )."
https://openalex.org/W2081383642,"The MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1)-ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) pathway is essential for sensing and signaling from DNA double-strand breaks. The MRN complex acts as a DNA damage sensor, maintains genome stability during DNA replication, promotes homology-dependent DNA repair and activates ATM. MRN is essential for cell viability, which has limited functional studies of the complex. Small-molecule inhibitors of MRN could circumvent this experimental limitation and could also be used as cellular radio- and chemosensitization compounds. Using cell-free systems that recapitulate faithfully the MRN-ATM signaling pathway, we designed a forward chemical genetic screen to identify inhibitors of the pathway, and we isolated Z-5-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-2-imino-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one (mirin, 1) as an inhibitor of MRN. Mirin prevents MRN-dependent activation of ATM without affecting ATM protein kinase activity, and it inhibits Mre11-associated exonuclease activity. Consistent with its ability to target the MRN complex, mirin abolishes the G2/M checkpoint and homology-dependent repair in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1993562792,"Fresh vegetables have become associated with outbreaks caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EcO157). Between 1995–2006, 22 produce outbreaks were documented in the United States, with nearly half traced to lettuce or spinach grown in California. Outbreaks between 2002 and 2006 induced investigations of possible sources of pre-harvest contamination on implicated farms in the Salinas and San Juan valleys of California, and a survey of the Salinas watershed. EcO157 was isolated at least once from 15 of 22 different watershed sites over a 19 month period. The incidence of EcO157 increased significantly when heavy rain caused an increased flow rate in the rivers. Approximately 1000 EcO157 isolates obtained from cultures of>100 individual samples were typed using Multi-Locus Variable-number-tandem-repeat Analysis (MLVA) to assist in identifying potential fate and transport of EcO157 in this region. A subset of these environmental isolates were typed by Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) in order to make comparisons with human clinical isolates associated with outbreak and sporadic illness. Recurrence of identical and closely related EcO157 strains from specific locations in the Salinas and San Juan valleys suggests that transport of the pathogen is usually restricted. In a preliminary study, EcO157 was detected in water at multiple locations in a low-flow creek only within 135 meters of a point source. However, possible transport up to 32 km was detected during periods of higher water flow associated with flooding. During the 2006 baby spinach outbreak investigation, transport was also detected where water was unlikely to be involved. These results indicate that contamination of the environment is a dynamic process involving multiple sources and methods of transport. Intensive studies of the sources, incidence, fate and transport of EcO157 near produce production are required to determine the mechanisms of pre-harvest contamination and potential risks for human illness."

https://openalex.org/W1970569685,"Heterochromatin is defined by distinct posttranslational modifications on histones, such as methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), which allows heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)–related chromodomain proteins to bind. Heterochromatin is frequently found near CENP-A chromatin, which is the key determinant of kinetochore assembly. We have discovered that the RNA interference (RNAi)–directed heterochromatin flanking the central kinetochore domain at fission yeast centromeres is required to promote CENP-A Cnp1 and kinetochore assembly over the central domain. The H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 (Suv39); the ribonuclease Dicer, which cleaves heterochromatic double-stranded RNA to small interfering RNA (siRNA); Chp1, a component of the RNAi effector complex (RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing; RITS); and Swi6 (HP1) are required to establish CENP-A Cnp1 chromatin on naïve templates. Once assembled, CENP-A Cnp1 chromatin is propagated by epigenetic means in the absence of heterochromatin. Thus, another, potentially conserved, role for centromeric RNAi-directed heterochromatin has been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2004000260,"The paucity of polymorphisms in single-copy genes on the Y chromosome of Drosophila contrasts with data indicating that this chromosome has polymorphic phenotypic effects on sex ratio, temperature sensitivity, behavior, and fitness. We show that the Y chromosome of D. melanogaster harbors substantial genetic diversity in the form of polymorphisms for genetic elements that differentially affect the expression of hundreds of X-linked and autosomal genes. The affected genes are more highly expressed in males, more meagerly expressed in females, and more highly divergent between species. Functionally, they affect microtubule stability, lipid and mitochondrial metabolism, and the thermal sensitivity of spermatogenesis. Our findings provide a mechanism for adaptive phenotypic variation associated with the Y chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2146579564,"Motor function requires that motor axons extend from the spinal cord at regular intervals and that they are myelinated by Schwann cells. Little attention has been given to another cellular structure, the perineurium, which ensheaths the motor nerve, forming a flexible, protective barrier. Consequently, the origin of perineurial cells and their roles in motor nerve formation are poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging in zebrafish, we show that perineurial cells are born in the CNS, arising as ventral spinal-cord glia before migrating into the periphery. In embryos lacking perineurial glia, motor neurons inappropriately migrated outside of the spinal cord and had aberrant axonal projections, indicating that perineurial glia carry out barrier and guidance functions at motor axon exit points. Additionally, reciprocal signaling between perineurial glia and Schwann cells was necessary for motor nerve ensheathment by both cell types. These insights reveal a new class of CNS-born glia that critically contributes to motor nerve development."
https://openalex.org/W2014950919,"Mechanisms of recognition are essential to the evolution of mutualistic and parasitic interactions between species. One such example is the larval mimicry that Maculinea butterfly caterpillars use to parasitize Myrmica ant colonies. We found that the greater the match between the surface chemistry of Maculinea alcon and two of its host Myrmica species, the more easily ant colonies were exploited. The geographic patterns of surface chemistry indicate an ongoing coevolutionary arms race between the butterflies and Myrmica rubra , which has significant genetic differentiation between populations, but not between the butterflies and a second, sympatric host, Myrmica ruginodis , which has panmictic populations. Alternative hosts may therefore provide an evolutionary refuge for a parasite during periods of counteradaptation by their preferred hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2025068152,"Although it is commonly assumed that subduction has operated continuously on Earth without interruption, subduction zones are routinely terminated by ocean closure and supercontinent assembly. Under certain circumstances, this could lead to a dramatic loss of subduction, globally. Closure of a Pacific-type basin, for example, would eliminate most subduction, unless this loss were compensated for by comparable subduction initiation elsewhere. Given the evidence for Pacific-type closure in Earth's past, the absence of a direct mechanism for termination/initiation compensation, and recent data supporting a minimum in subduction flux in the Mesoproterozoic, we hypothesize that dramatic reductions or temporary cessations of subduction have occurred in Earth's history. Such deviations in the continuity of plate tectonics have important consequences for Earth's thermal and continental evolution."

https://openalex.org/W1994731691,"Ediacara fossils [575 to 542 million years ago (Ma)] represent Earth's oldest known complex macroscopic life forms, but their morphological history is poorly understood. A comprehensive quantitative analysis of these fossils indicates that the oldest Ediacara assemblage—the Avalon assemblage (575 to 565 Ma)—already encompassed the full range of Ediacara morphospace. A comparable morphospace range was occupied by the subsequent White Sea (560 to 550 Ma) and Nama (550 to 542 Ma) assemblages, although it was populated differently. In contrast, taxonomic richness increased in the White Sea assemblage and declined in the Nama assemblage. These diversity changes, occurring while morphospace range remained relatively constant, led to inverse shifts in morphological variance. The Avalon morphospace expansion mirrors the Cambrian explosion, and both events may reflect similar underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2147166014,"In vivo experience can occlude subsequent induction of long-term potentiation and enhance long-term depression of synaptic responses. Although a reduced capacity for synaptic strengthening may function to prevent excessive excitation, such an effect paradoxically implies that continued experience or training should not improve and may even degrade neural representations. In mice, we examined the effect of ongoing whisker stimulation on synaptic strengthening at layer 4-2/3 synapses in the barrel cortex. Although N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors were required to initiate strengthening, they subsequently suppressed further potentiation at these synapses in vitro and in vivo. Despite this transition, synaptic strengthening continued with additional sensory activity but instead required the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, suggesting a mechanism by which continued experience can result in increasing synaptic strength over time."
https://openalex.org/W2058876100,"O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a post-translational modification of proteins that functions as a nutrient sensing mechanism. Here we report on regulation of O-GlcNAcylation over a broad range of glucose concentrations. We have discovered a significant induction of O-GlcNAc modification of a limited number of proteins under conditions of glucose deprivation. Beginning 12 h after treatment, glucose-deprived human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells demonstrate a 7.8-fold increase in total O-GlcNAc modification compared with cells cultured in normal glucose (5 mm; p = 0.008). Some of the targets of glucose deprivation-induced O-GlcNAcylation are distinct from those modified in response to high glucose (20 mm) or glucosamine (10 mm) treatment, suggesting differential targeting with glucose deprivation and glucose excess. O-GlcNAcylation of glycogen synthase is significantly increased with glucose deprivation, and this O-GlcNAc increase contributes to a 60% decrease (p = 0.004) in glycogen synthase activity. Increased O-GlcNAc modification is not mediated by increased UDP-GlcNAc, the rate-limiting substrate for O-GlcNAcylation. Rather, the mRNA for nucleocytoplasmic O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (OGT) increases 3.4-fold within 6 h of glucose deprivation (p = 0.006). Within 12 h, OGT protein increases 1.7-fold (p = 0.01) compared with normal glucose-treated cells. In addition, 12-h glucose deprivation leads to a 49% decrease in O-GlcNAcase protein levels (p = 0.03). We conclude that increased O-GlcNAc modification stimulated by glucose deprivation results from increased OGT and decreased O-GlcNAcase levels and that these changes affect cell metabolism, thus inactivating glycogen synthase.

Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase is the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. OGT catalyzes GlcNAc transfer to serine and threonine residues of target proteins, whereas O-GlcNAcase catalyzes O-GlcNAc removal.O-GlcNAc is known to affect multiple metabolic pathways and has been implicated specifically as a contributor to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (5McClain D.A.

Chronically elevated HBP flux, a result of hyperglycemia, is known to exacerbate metabolic dysregulation in part by targeting metabolic enzymes. For example, in diabetic mice, glycogen synthase (GS) becomes resistant to insulin stimulation as its level of O-GlcNAc modification increases (8Parker G.J. Lund K.C. Taylor R.P. McClain D.A. J.

To date, the majority of reports of O-GlcNAc-mediated metabolic changes attribute increased O-GlcNAc modification to increased HBP flux. We report a novel and significant induction of O-GlcNAc modification in glucose-deprived HepG2 cells that is independent of increased HBP flux and appears distinct from previously reported stress-induced O-GlcNAc induction. Rather, increased O-GlcNAc with glucose deprivation is mediated by induction of OGT and down-regulation of O-GlcNAcase. Increased O-GlcNAcylation of GS in these conditions contributes to decreased GS activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—The following antibodies were used in the current study: anti-O-GlcNAc monoclonal IgM (CTD110.6, a gift of Dr. G. Hart, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), anti-O-GlcNAcase (a gift of Dr. S. W. Whiteheart, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling), anti-OGT (DM-17, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-glycogen synthase (Cell Signaling; catalog no. 3886), anti-phosphoglycogen synthase (Cell Signaling), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) and anti-mouse IgM (Calbiochem). Succinylated wheat germ agglutinin-agarose (sWGA; EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA), the HepG2 cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were obtained from the indicated sources. All enzymes and chemicals were obtained from Sigma with the exception of the following: UDP-[6-3H]glucose (GE Healthcare); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum (Invitrogen); O-GlcNAcase inhibitor, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc; Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario, Canada); Complete tablet protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science); and TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). All chromatography media and columns were obtained from GE Healthcare. The Beckman Glucose Analyzer II (Beckman Coulter) was used for media glucose determination.Growth, Treatment, and Extraction of HepG2 Cells—HepG2 cells were grown in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in 10-cm plates (Corning Glass) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The medium was replaced 1 day prior to experimental treatment initiation; media glucose concentrations at treatment initiation averaged 10 mm. Experimental treatments were initiated once cells reached 70% confluence. We found 70% confluence to be optimal for promoting the glucose deprivation effect; under- and over-confluent cells demonstrated a diminished glucose deprivation effect. Experimental treatment of each plate comprised 10 ml of glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 0–40 mm glucose. Glucosamine treatments included glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 4 mm l-glutamine, 2.5 mm glucose, and 10 mm d-glucosamine. Because media glucose concentrations depleted significantly over time in pilot experiments, media glucose concentrations were assayed every 3 h (using the Beckman Glucose Analyzer II), and glucose was replenished to achieve consistent glucose concentrations throughout treatment. Experimental treatment lasted 0–24 h. No cell death was observed for any of the treatment durations. For protein extracts, plates were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 4.4 mm potassium chloride, 1.2 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm magnesium chloride, and 1.9 mm calcium chloride), and then the cells were harvested in 0.75 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm sodium chloride, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 μm PUGNAc, and protease inhibitors). The resulting cell suspension was sonicated with a Sonic Dismembrator F60 for 15 s at setting 6 (Thermo) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Supernatant aliquots were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells whose lysates were subsequently digested with hexosaminidase were harvested as above, but in a modified extraction buffer lacking PUGNAc and EDTA to prevent hexosaminidase inhibition. For cells used for RNA determination, the medium was aspirated/discarded, and 1 ml of TRI Reagent was immediately applied to the cells. Cells were scraped, disrupted by repeated pipetting, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.Western Blotting—Protein concentrations of HepG2 lysates were determined using Bio-Rad protein reagent. Lysates were prepared for gel electrophoresis by dilution with extraction buffer and 5× Laemmli buffer. 10 μg of protein was added to each lane. SDS-PAGE was conducted using the Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN 3 electrophoresis cell, and resolved proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-PSQ transfer membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Resulting blots were blocked with TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 0.5% Tween 20) containing 4% (w/v) nonfat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. 4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin was used in lieu of dried milk for detection with the anti-O-GlcNAc antibody. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, washed three times in TBST, and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed five times in TBST and imaged by treatment with Super Signal West Dura reagents (Pierce) and by exposure to Classic Blue BX autoradiography film (Molecular Technologies, St. Louis, MO). Densitometry measurements were obtained using an Epson Perfection 3200 photo scanner and NIH Image version 1.62 software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). In all experiments, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein levels were used to normalize changes in protein/modification. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein levels were not affected by the various cell treatments of these studies (see Fig. 1, A and C; and Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2GS O-GlcNAcylation is increased with glucose deprivation, and this increase contributes to a decrease in GS activity. A, glucose-deprived cells exhibit a 60% decrease in maximal glycogen synthase activity compared with 5 mm glucose treatment (p = 0.004; n = four independent determinations). B, glucose-deprived cells exhibit a 6.75-fold increase in O-GlcNAc modification of glycogen synthase (p = 0.05; n = six independent determinations). Glycogen synthase was immunoprecipitated (IP) from cell lysates and immunoblotted (IB) with α-GS to demonstrate equivalent GS pulldown and with α-O-GlcNAc (CTD110.6) to demonstrate changes in O-GlcNAc modification of GS. Failure to precipitate GS with rabbit IgG confirmed specific GS precipitation (not shown). C, glucose-deprived cells exhibit a 3.3-fold increase in sWGA-bound/O-GlcNAc-modified glycogen synthase (p = 0.002; n = five independent determinations). Inset, sWGA-precipitated proteins immunoblotted with α-GS are shown. D, immunoblots of total GS and phospho-GS (pGS) levels demonstrate no change among treatments, suggesting that changes in glycogen synthase activity are not due to changes in GS protein or phospho-GS levels (representative blots of at least three independent determinations per treatment). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was probed as a loading control (n = at least three independent determinations per treatment). E, glucose-deprived lysates digested with hexosaminidase demonstrate a 40% rescue of glycogen synthase total activity (0–versus 0+; p = 0.003; n = six independent determinations). **, p ≤ 0.001.

Briefly, 300 μl of cell lysate (600 μg of protein) combined with glycogen synthase antibody (1:25) was rotated overnight at 4 °C. Incubation with rabbit IgG served as the negative control. 20 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (50% bead slurry) was added, and mixtures were rotated for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C), and the supernatant was discarded. Some supernatant was retained and run as a positive control. Beads were washed five times with 500 μl of 1× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min and loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4–15%). Western-blotted membranes were probed with α-O-GlcNAc (CTD110.6) and α-GS.Immobilization of O-GlcNAc-modified Proteins with Wheat Germ Agglutinin—400 μl of lysate (1 mg of protein/ml) was incubated with 25 μl of sWGA and 400 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (11 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Igepal, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 40 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm 2-acetamido-1-amino-1,2-dideoxyglucopyranose, and protease inhibitors). The preparation was rotated for 16 h at 4 °C and washed two times with extraction buffer/radioimmune precipitation buffer (1:1). Immobilized proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to an Immobilon-PSQ membrane. Levels of O-GlcNAc modification were determined by probing for sWGA-bound/O-GlcNAc-modified target proteins with the appropriate antibodies.Quantitation of mRNA by Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was prepared from –70 °C frozen TRI Reagent/cell suspensions according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) and dissolved in water. RNA concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically. First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using 3 μg of RNA, oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen), and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Realtime PCR was performed with a rapid thermal cycler (Light-Cycler, Roche Diagnostics). Reactions (10 μl) were performed using ∼16 ng of cDNA as a template with 0.5 μm each primer, 200 μm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 500 μg/ml nonacetylated bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 3.0 mm MgCl2, 0.04 units/μl Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and a 1:30,000 dilution of SYBR Green I fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Primers based on human sequences were chosen using the Primer3 program: nucleocytoplasmic OGT, 5′-CTTTAGCACTCTGGCAATTAAACAG-3′ and 5′-TCAAATAACATGCCTTGGCTTC-3′; mitochondrial OGT, 5′-TTTACCTCCTTTCCCTCCCATC-3′ and 5′-CTGTCAAAAATGCGTGCCTCT-3′; all OGT isoforms, 5′-CTGCCCCAGAACCGTATCA-3′ and 5′-TTCCAGACTTTGCCACGAACT-3′; O-GlcNAcase, 5′-AGCCTTGAGTGGTGAGCCTA-3′ and 5′-TCTGGGGATTTTGATTCAGC-3′; and NONO (non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein), 5′-CAAGTGGACCGCAACATCA-3′ and 5′-CGCCGCATCTCTTCTTCAC-3′. We assayed the expression of six different potential normalizer genes and found that NONO expression was consistent across all cell treatments. Amplification occurred over 26–45 four-step cycles, with a rate of temperature change between steps of 20 °C/s. The steps were 95 °C with a 0-s hold, 60 °C with a 0-s hold, 72 °C with an 11-s hold, and 80 °C with a 1-s hold. Fluorescence was detected during the fourth step at a temperature determined previously to be below the melting temperature of the PCR products. After amplification, a melting curve was generated by slowly heating the double-stranded DNA product. Analysis of the postamplification melting curves confirmed the absence of nonspecific DNA products. For each amplification's fluorescence versus cycle line, the LightCycler software determined the second derivative maximum (the threshold cycle at which fluorescence clearly increased above background). Standard curves of log cDNA versus second derivative maximum (fractional cycle number) were constructed for each quantitated transcript and for the NONO normalization transcript, from cDNA mixtures comprising equal amounts of all cell treatment condition cDNAs. Standard curve points of 0, 6, 10, 16, 26, and 32 ng of combined cell cDNA were always included with the same PCR run with the entire set of individual cDNA amplifications of the same transcript. Results for each individual cDNA were normalized by dividing the relative amount of each transcript by the relative amount of NONO transcript from the same experiment. Within each experiment the same mixture was used, containing everything but the specific primers.UDP-N-Acetylhexosamine Assay—Levels of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines (consisting of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc), products of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, were measured in cell extracts as described previously (11Robinson K.A. Weinstein M.L. Lindenmayer G.E. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1438-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were homogenized at 4 °C in 4 volumes of perchloric acid (300 mm). The precipitates were centrifuged (10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and the lipid was extracted from the supernatants with 2 volumes of tri-n-octylamine:1,1,2-trichlorofluoroethane (1:4). The aqueous phase was stored at –80 °C until analysis by HPLC. The extracts were filtered (0.45 μm); HPLC was performed on a Partisil 10.5Ax column (25 cm x 4.6 mm, Waters Corp., Taunton, MA); and the extracts were eluted with a concave gradient from 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) to 750 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) over 48 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. UDP-N-acetylhexosamine levels were quantified by UV absorption at 254 nm and compared with external standards.Glycogen Synthase Assay—The assay for glycogen synthase was performed as described previously (8Parker G.J. Lund K.C. Taylor R.P. McClain D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10022-10027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). HepG2 lysate (7.5 μg of protein) was incubated in a 100-μl final volume with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 0.8 mg of glycogen (type III from rabbit liver), 2 mm UDP-glucose, 10 μl of glycerol, 0 or 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 0.4 μCi of UDP-[6-3H]glucose for 45 min at 37 °C. The incubation was terminated by application to Whatman qualitative filter paper (No. 3MM, Maidstone, UK) and immersion in 60% (v/v) ethanol. After five washes in 400 ml of 60% ethanol, the paper squares were washed once in acetone, dried, and assayed for tritium. All assays were done in duplicate. The incorporation of tritium was found to be optimal at 37 °C and linear for 120 min. Total GS activity was defined as the activity at maximal glucose 6-phosphate (10 mm).Digestion of HepG2 Extracts with Hexosaminidase—Hexosaminidase digestions were conducted by treating cell lysates (50 μg of protein) with 1 unit of N-acetylglucosaminidase from jack beans (Sigma) and 25 μl of hexosaminidase buffer (20 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm sodium chloride, and protease inhibitors) and incubating the preparation for 1 h at 30 °C. Lysates not digested with hexosaminidase were protected from deglycosylation by the addition of PUGNAc (50 μm); PUGNAc inhibits endogenous O-GlcNAcase. Immediately following digestion, glycogen synthase activation was measured as described above.Statistics—Descriptive statistics are represented as mean ± S.E. Each mean represents data from at least three independent experiments. Student's t test (two-tail) was used to compare differences between groups.RESULTSGlucose Deprivation of HepG2 Cells Stimulates O-GlcNAc Protein Modification—We assayed the HepG2 human liver cell line for changes in O-GlcNAcylation of proteins in response to changes in ambient glucose concentration. We chose to study O-GlcNAc changes in liver cells because of the liver's central role in carbohydrate metabolism and its glucose responsiveness. HepG2 cells were cultured for 12 h with 0–40 mm glucose. O-GlcNAc levels were determined by Western blot analysis of HepG2 cell lysates using the O-GlcNAc-specific antibody CTD110.6. Media glucose concentration had a significant effect on O-GlcNAc modification of a number of cellular proteins. Cells cultured in 0 mm glucose showed a total increase in O-GlcNAc of 7.8-fold (p = 0.008) and 4.1-fold (p = 0.05) compared with cells cultured in normal and high glucose, respectively (Fig. 1). Appreciable increases of O-GlcNAc with glucose deprivation first appear at 12 h and continue to increase through 18 and 24 h (Fig. 1C). Glucosamine treatment has been shown to stimulate O-GlcNAc modification even more potently than high glucose in a variety of systems (12Marshall S. Nadeau O. Yamasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35313-35319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, we observed 3-fold greater O-glycosylation with glucose deprivation than with glucosamine treatment (p = 0.02; Fig. 1, A and B).Although some protein targets demonstrate increased O-GlcNAc modification with both glucose deprivation and high glucose/glucosamine conditions, others are highly glycosylated exclusively with glucose deprivation. For two protein bands (Fig. 1A, bands b and c, ∼250 and ∼150 kDa, respectively), O-glycosylation is maximal with glucose deprivation and also increases with high glucose/GlcN treatment, with the lowest glycosylation levels at 1 mm glucose. Other proteins (Fig. 1A, band a, >250 kDa) fail to show glycosylation with high glucose/glucosamine treatment, but demonstrate robust glycosylation exclusively with glucose deprivation. Yet other targets (Fig. 1A, band d, ∼75 kDa) demonstrate bimodal modification in which glycosylation is lowest at normal (5 mm) glucose and increases with both lower and higher glucose concentrations, suggesting that some targets are regulated by O-GlcNAc modification throughout the entire range of physiologic glucose concentrations.Increased O-GlcNAcylation of GS in Glucose-deprived Cells Contributes to a Decrease in Activity—The O-GlcNAc modification induced by glucose deprivation is functionally significant. We have shown previously in adipocytes that O-GlcNAc modification of GS in conditions of high glucose decreases GS activity (8Parker G.J. Lund K.C. Taylor R.P. McClain D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10022-10027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This is also the case with glucose deprivation of HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells cultured in 0 mm glucose for 12 h exhibit a 60% decrease in maximal glycogen synthase activity compared with 5 mm glucose treatment (p = 0.004; Fig. 2A). We observed no differences in GS activity among cells treated with 5 and 20 mm glucose or glucosamine (Fig. 2A). The decrease in activity observed with glucose deprivation correlates with a 675% increase in O-GlcNAc-modified GS levels (p = 0.05; Fig. 2B) and a 330% increase in the amount of GS precipitated by sWGA (p = 0.002; Fig. 2C), a lectin that specifically binds terminal GlcNAc. We observed no difference in glycogen synthase protein amounts across glucose treatments or phosphoglycogen synthase levels among treatments (Fig. 2, B and D). We also detected no change in the Km of GS from glucose-deprived cells for its substrate UDP-glucose or its allosteric activator glucose-6-phosphate (data not shown).To demonstrate directly that O-GlcNAc modification contributes to the observed decrease in GS activity, we treated cell lysates with hexosaminidase to reduce the levels of O-GlcNAc modification. This treatment resulted in a 40% rescue of total GS activity after glucose deprivation (p = 0.003), whereas digestion of lysates from cells treated with normal glucose demonstrated no change in total activity (Fig. 2E). We observed a significant decrease in O-GlcNAc modification of proteins to background levels after hexosaminidase digestion, confirming deglycosylation (data not shown).Increased O-GlcNAc with Glucose Deprivation Does Not Result from Increased HBP Flux—Previous reports have mainly attributed increases of cellular O-GlcNAc to increased HBP flux and synthesis of the end product of the pathway, UDP-GlcNAc (1Hebert Jr., L.F. Daniels M.C. Zhou J. Crook E.D. Turner R.L. Simmons S.T. Neidigh J.L. Zhu J.S. Baron A.D. McClain D.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 13Cooksey R.C. Hebert Jr., L.F. Zhu J.H. Wofford P. Garvey W.T. McClain D.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is not the case in glucose-deprived HepG2 cells. Cells cultured for 12 h in 0 mm glucose, which demonstrate a 7.8-fold increase in O-GlcNAc (Fig. 1, A and B), exhibit a 40% decrease in UDP-GlcNAc levels compared with normal glucose-treated cells (p = 0.01). UDP-GlcNAc levels increased 236% (p = 0.008) with high glucose and 616% (p = 0.01) with glucosamine treatment compared with 0 mm glucose treatment (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3UDP-GlcNAc and HBP flux are decreased with glucose deprivation. HepG2 cells were cultured for 12 h with 0–40 mm glucose or 10 mm GlcN. UDP-GlcNAc levels were measured, normalized to protein concentration, and calculated as proportions of the level for normal glucose treatments to allow for experiment-to-experiment averaging. Cells cultured in 0 mm glucose exhibited a 40% decrease in UDP-GlcNAc levels (1.8 μm/μg of protein/μl) compared with normal glucose (2.9 μm/μg of protein/μl; p = 0.01). UDP-GlcNAc levels increased 236% with high glucose (4.1μm/μg of protein/μl; p = 0.008) and 616% with glucosamine (12.2 μm/μg of protein/μl; p = 0.01) compared with 0 mm glucose treatment. Average UDP-GlcNAc levels are based on at least three independent determinations per treatment. **, p ≤ 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nucleocytoplasmic OGT mRNA and OGT Protein Levels Are Increased in Glucose-deprived Cells—To explore the mechanisms for increased O-GlcNAc modification in the absence of increased HBP flux, we examined expression of OGT in conditions of glucose deprivation.

https://openalex.org/W1987132484,"Myostatin, a transforming growth factor-β superfamily ligand, negatively regulates skeletal muscle growth. Generation of the mature signaling peptide requires cleavage of pro-myostatin by a proprotein convertase, which is thought to occur constitutively in the Golgi apparatus. In serum, mature myostatin is found in an inactive, non-covalent complex with its prodomain. We find that in skeletal muscle, unlike serum, myostatin is present extracellularly as uncleaved pro-myostatin. In cultured cells, co-expression of pro-myostatin and latent transforming growth factor-β-binding protein-3 (LTBP-3) sequesters pro-myostatin in the extracellular matrix, and secreted pro-myostatin can be cleaved extracellularly by the proprotein convertase furin. Co-expression of LTBP-3 with myostatin reduces phosphorylation of Smad2, and ectopic expression of LTBP-3 in mature mouse skeletal muscle increases fiber area, consistent with reduction of myostatin activity. We propose that extracellular pro-myostatin constitutes the major pool of latent myostatin in muscle. Post-secretion activation of this pool by furin family proprotein convertases may therefore represent a major control point for activation of myostatin in skeletal muscle.

Loss of myostatin function, in knock-out mice or mice treated with inhibitors, results in up to a 2-fold increase in skeletal muscle mass due to an increased number of muscle fibers and increased muscle fiber size (1McPherron A.C.

In adults, myostatin activity is regulated at several levels. First, myostatin expression is limited to a few cell types, including skeletal muscle and, to a lesser extent, adipose and heart tissues (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar, 6Sharma M. Kambadur R. Matthews K.G. Somers W.G. Devlin G.P. Conaglen J.V. Fowke P.J. Bass J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Second, myostatin is synthesized as a precursor protein that remains inactive until it is modified by several post-translational events (7Lee S.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 61-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Third, multiple extracellular inhibitors limit access of myostatin to cell surface receptors (3Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 7Lee S.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 61-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The myostatin precursor, referred to as pro-myostatin, forms a disulfide-linked homodimer following synthesis and translocation in the endoplasmic reticulum (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar, 3Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Like other TGF-β superfamily ligands, pro-myostatin is cleaved into amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments at a tetrabasic cleavage site by the furin family of proprotein convertases (PCs) (3Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 8Scamuffa N. Calvo F. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Khatib A.M.

Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This cleavage is thought to occur primarily in the Golgi apparatus, and the COOH-terminal, disulfide-linked product of this cleavage is the mature myostatin ligand. The mature myostatin homodimer remains non-covalently associated with the prodomain in a latent complex that is abundant in mouse serum in vivo (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar, 9Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 40735-40741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The BMP-1/tolloid family of metalloproteinases can activate this latent complex by proteolytic cleavage between Arg-75 and Asp-76 of the myostatin prodomain (11Wolfman N.M. McPherron A.C. Pappano W.N. Davies M.V. Song K. Tomkinson K.N. Wright J.F. Zhao L. Sebald S.M. Greenspan D.S. Lee S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15842-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Following this activation of the latent complex, mature myostatin activates the Smad2/Smad3 signal cascade (12Langley B.

Wrana J.L. Celeste A.J. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7230-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Several additional myostatin inhibitors have been identified in serum, including follistatin, GASP-1, and FLRG. It is still unclear, however, to what extent these inhibitors act individually or in conjunction with the inhibitory prodomain (10Hill J.J. Davies M.V. Pearson A.A. Wang J.H. Hewick R.M. Wolfman N.M.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1144-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, the current model for myostatin activation suggests that the latent myostatin complex is constitutively secreted into circulation from myostatin-producing cells, and that the activity of this complex is regulated by BMP-1/tolloid metalloproteinases and secreted inhibitors. Like myostatin, canonical TGF-β ligands are retained in a latent complex containing a mature peptide homodimer and a non-covalently associated inhibitory prodomain. The latter is commonly referred to as latency associated peptide (LAP) (15Miyazono K. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β latent complexes also covalently associate with latent TGF-β-binding proteins (LTBPs), which are required for efficient folding and secretion of the ligands (16Rifkin D.B. J. Biol.

Of the four LTBPs identified, LTBPs 1, 3, and 4 form a disulfide linkage with cysteine 33 of the TGF-β LAP (15Miyazono K. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. J. Biol.

The domain of LTBP that forms this disulfide bond with LAP is an 8-Cys motif that is unique to the LTBP/Fibrillin family (21Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29891-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Once secreted, the TGF-β·LTBP complex, called large latent complex, covalently associates with the extracellular matrix (ECM) through LTBP (24Nunes I. Gleizes P.E. Metz C.N. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1151-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). TGF-β ligands must be released from this latent complex to signal (25Koli K. Saharinen J. Hyytiainen M. Penttinen C. Keski-Oja J. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 52: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The binding of latent TGF-β to LTBPs tethers the latent complex to the ECM, providing a mechanism for local activation of TGF-β signaling. In the case of latent myostatin in serum, however, how local activation in tissues might be regulated is not clear. Despite our detailed understanding of how LTBPs interact with canonical TGF-β ligands, little is known about interactions between LTBPs and other ligands in the TGF-β superfamily. In Xenopus, LTBP-1 (xLTBP-1) has been shown to synergize with the TGF-β superfamily ligands activin and nodal to induce mesoderm, but the basis for this synergy is not known (26Altmann C.R. Chang C. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Bell E. Heke M. Rifkin D.B. Brivanlou A.H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To what extent LTBPs interact generally with TGF-β superfamily ligands, and whether these interactions share common mechanisms or functions with those reported for LTBPs and TGF-β, have not been elucidated. The maturation of TGF-β superfamily ligands by furin-like proteases is thought to occur constitutively in the Golgi apparatus. In the case of the TGF-β superfamily ligand nodal, however, it has recently been demonstrated that the PCs furin and PACE4 act extracellularly to cleave secreted pro-nodal into mature ligand, thus localizing nodal activity near cells that secrete PCs (27Beck S. Good Le J.A. Guzman M. Haim Ben N. Roy K. Beermann F. Constam D.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This provides an intriguing example of localization of ligand activity by extracellular localization of maturation activity, but whether this example has broader relevance to regulation of TGF-β superfamily ligands is not known. In this article we demonstrate that the predominant form of myostatin detectable in muscle is the pro-form, that this pro-myostatin is present extracellularly, and can be cleaved extracellulary by furin proteases. We also find that pro-myostatin associates with LTBPs, and that the major LTBP expressed in skeletal muscle, LTBP-3, sequesters pro-myostatin in the ECM. This retention of pro-myostatin by LTBP-3 limits myostatin signaling, as demonstrated by LTBP-3-dependent reduction of myostatin-induced Smad2 activation. In addition, ectopic expression of LTBP-3 in adult mouse skeletal muscle increases fiber area, consistent with the local inhibition of myostatin activity. These observations point to local maturation of secreted pro-myostatin in skeletal muscle by furin-like PCs as a significant new point of regulation of myostatin activation, and suggest new approaches to the therapeutic inhibition of myostatin function for the treatment of muscle-wasting diseases. Expression Constructs—pBS(KS+) mouse myostatin was a gift from Se-Jin Lee (John Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Mouse myostatin was subcloned into pCS4+ using the restriction sites StuI and XhoI. FLAG myostatin and HA myostatin were constructed by inserting codons 23-376 of mouse myostatin into a pCS4+ vector containing the Xnr1 signal peptide (codons 1-12) followed by either 3-FLAG or 3-HA epitope tags. FLAG myostatin prodomain/mature domain was constructed with 3 FLAG epitope tags following the Xnr1 signal peptide, as above, followed by 3 FLAG epitope tags at codon 272 of the myostatin mature domain. FLAG myostatin prodomain was constructed by PCR-based subcloning. FLAG myostatin prodomain contains the Xnr1 signal peptide (codons 1-12), 3 FLAG epitope tags, and mouse myostatin prodomain (codons 23-266). FLAG myostatin ANAA was constructed by changing codons 39-42 from CNAC to ANAA by mutagenesis PCR using the template FLAG mouse myostatin and the mutagenesis primer 5′-GAGAGAGAAGAAAATGTGGAAAAAGAAGGCCTAGCTAATGCAGCAGCGTGGAGACAAAACACGAGG-3′. HA epitope-tagged human LTBP-2 and mouse LTBP-3 were provided in pcDNA3 vectors by Daniel B. Rifkin (New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY). pCS4+ mouse LTBP-3ΔC HA was constructed by PCR-based subcloning. Mouse LTBP3-ΔC HA contains the mouse LTBP-3 signal peptide (codons 1-22), one HA epitope tag, and mouse LTBP-3 codons 41-883. pCS2 + 6Myc human Smad3 was provided by Jeffrey L. Wrana (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario). pGEM7zf Furin:Flag was provided by Gary Thomas (Vollum Institute, Portland, OR). PCR-based subcloning was used to insert codons 1-802 of Furin:Flag into pCS4+. pCS4+ Furin: FlagΔC was constructed by PCR-based subcloning of codons 1-723 of Furin:Flag into pCS4+. In Vitro Translation—In vitro translation of pCS4+ FLAG myostatin was performed using the Promega TnT® SP6-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (L4600, Promega, Madison, WI). Tissue Culture—293T human kidney epithelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (10-437-028, Invitrogen), 50 IU/ml penicillin-streptomycin (30-001-C1, Mediatech, Herndon, VA). Cells were transfected using 25-kDa linear polyethylenimine (23966, Polysciences, Warrington, PA) as described previously (28Durocher Y. Perret S. Kamen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Xenopus Ectoderm Explants—Xenopus embryos were collected, fertilized, and cultured as previously described (29Faure S. Lee M.A. Keller T. Dijke ten P. Whitman M. Development. 2000; 127: 2917-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lee M.A. Heasman J. Whitman M. Development. 2001; 128: 2939-2952PubMed Google Scholar). Each blastomere of 2-cell stage embryos was injected with synthetic mRNA that was transcribed using the SP6 mMessage mMachine™ Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). 200 pg of HA myostatin and 1500 pg of LTBP-3 HA RNA were injected as indicated. Ectoderm explants were harvested as previously described (30Lee M.A. Heasman J. Whitman M. Development. 2001; 128: 2939-2952PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of Mouse Tibialis Anterior Muscle and Fiber Area Measurements—Adult female CD1 mice weighing 34-39 g were used. All mice were housed in the Seeley G. Mudd Animal Facility at Harvard Medical School. Tibialis anterior muscles were transfected as described previously (31Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C. Calabria E. Picard A. Walsh K. Schiaffino S. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 2004; 117: 399-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). A 150 mm NaCl solution containing 5 μg of pCS2+ GFP CAAX and 16 μg of pcDNA3 mouse LTBP-3 HA plasmid DNA was injected into the tibialis anterior muscle, as indicated. Electric pulses were applied to the muscle at 50 volts/cm, 5 pulses, 100-ms intervals. Muscles were harvested 7 days later and processed by cryosection. Sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Pictures of muscle cross-sections were captured with a ×10 objective using a Zeiss Axio Imager.M1 with AxioVision Release 4.5 software. Images were layered and color was added using Adobe Photoshop Software (San Jose, CA). Muscle fiber area was determined for GFP positive fibers using IMAGE software (Scion, Frederick, MD). At least 725 fibers were counted for each condition in a total of four mice. Precipitation and Western Blotting—Cultured 293T cells were rinsed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline then lysed in modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2× Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40). Lysates were centrifuged and supernatants collected. NP-40-insoluble cell fraction was obtained by adding modified RIPA buffer plus 2 mm EDTA, 1% SDS to cell pellets that remained after lysis. Xenopus ectoderm explants were homogenized in modified RIPA buffer, plus 2 mm EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, as above. Skeletal muscle and liver samples were rinsed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline then lysed in modified RIPA buffer plus 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate. Samples were homogenized using a Polytron tissue homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged and supernatants collected. For concanavalin A (ConA) precipitation, samples were incubated in ConA-agarose (Sigma), 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2 for 4 h at 4 °C. Samples bound to ConA-agarose were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, 1% NP-40, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2; once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, 1% NP-40, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2; and once with cold Tris buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0)), 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2. Protein was eluted from the ConA-agarose overnight at 4 °C with modified RIPA buffer plus 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.75 m methyl α-d-mannopyranoside (Sigma). The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitations. Anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10; Roche), followed by incubation with protein A matrix preincubated in rat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA); anti-Biotin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA); anti-mouse GDF-8 propeptide sheep polyclonal antibody (AF1539, R&D, Minneapolis, MN), followed by incubation with protein A matrix preincubated in sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories); anti-mouse GDF-8 goat polyclonal antibody (AF788, R&D), followed by incubation with protein A matrix preincubated in goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories). The following antibodies were used for Western blotting. Anti-HA-peroxidase rat monoclonal peroxidase-conjugated antibody (clone 3F10; Roche); anti-FLAG-peroxidase mouse monoclonal peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Sigma); anti-Myc-peroxidase mouse monoclonal peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Roche); anti-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (A4700, Sigma); anti-P-Smad2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA); anti-mouse GDF-8 propeptide sheep polyclonal antibody (AF1539, R&D); and anti-mouse GDF-8 goat polyclonal antibody (AF788, R&D). Glycosidase Treatment—For PNGase treatment, immunoprecipitated proteins were treated with the glycosidase PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1% NP-40 for 2 h at 37 °C. Sulfo-NHS-Biotin-LC Treatment—For 293T cells, 1 mg/ml EZ Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (21335, Pierce) was added to 293T cells in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) (pH 8.0). Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, then sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin was quenched with HBS, 100 mm glycine (pH 8.0). For mouse skeletal muscle and liver, 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin was added to dissected skeletal muscle or liver from adult female CD1 mice in Krebs bicarbonate ringer solution (Krebs buffer) (pH 8.0). Tissues were incubated on ice for 30 min, then sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin was quenched with Krebs buffer, 100 mm glycine (pH 8.0). Myostatin Interacts with Latent TGF-β-binding Proteins—LTBPs assist in the secretion of canonical TGF-β ligands and their retention in the ECM (32Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To determine whether LTBPs play a role in the regulation of myostatin, we investigated whether myostatin interacts with LTBPs. We compared, in transfected 293T cells, the binding of myostatin to LTBP-3, the most highly expressed LTBP in skeletal muscle, and to LTBP-2, which is expressed at low levels in muscle cells (expression of ectopic LTBP-1 and LTBP-4 was very low in our hands and was not pursued) (18Moren A. Olofsson A. Stenman G. Sahlin P. Kanzaki T. Claesson-Welsh L. Dijke ten P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32469-32478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Penttinen C. Saharinen J. Weikkolainen K. Hyytiainen M. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3457-3468PubMed Google Scholar). Pro-myostatin interacts with LTBP-2 and LTBP-3 in co-immunoprecipitations from 293T cells (Fig. 1A). The prodomain of myostatin alone interacts very poorly with LTBP-3 (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that the mature region is important for stable interaction of pro-myostatin with LTBP-3. Mature myostatin, however, is not immunoprecipitated by LTBP-3, indicating that myostatin does not interact with LTBP-3 following proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 1C), and that both the mature and pro-domains of myostatin are necessary for stable interaction with LTBP-3. We also observed (Fig. 1C) that LTBP-3 expression results in a decrease in the amount of mature myostatin in lysates, indicating that LTBP-3 can inhibit production of mature myostatin. We noted that pro-myostatin is present in 293T cells as a doublet, and that each LTBP immunoprecipitated different forms of this pro-myostatin doublet; LTBP-2 predominantly precipitated the faster migrating form of pro-myostatin, whereas LTBP-3 almost exclusively precipitated the slower migrating form of pro-myostatin (Figs. 1A and 2A). The most likely basis for altered migration of pro-myostatin is the addition of N-linked glycosylations during passage through the secretory pathway (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar, 34Jiang M.S. Liang L.F. Wang S. Ratovitski T. Holmstrom J. Barker C. Stotish R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine whether the pro-myostatin doublet we observed was a result of N-linked glycosylation, we compared the migration of pro-myostatin synthesized in vitro, in the absence of the secretory apparatus, to pro-myostatin isolated from cells and treated with or without the deglycosylating enzyme PNGase F (Fig. 2A). The faster migrating form of pro-myostatin corresponds in size to pro-myostatin expressed in vitro and to PNGase-treated pro-myostatin, indicating that the faster migrating form of pro-myostatin is the unglycosylated form. The slower migrating form of pro-myostatin is converted to the faster migrating form by PNGase F treatment, indicating that N-linked glycosylations are responsible for the difference in migration. When co-expressed myostatin and LTBP-3 were immunoprecipitated for the HA epitope tag in LTBP-3, PNGase F treatment shifted the LTBP-3-associated pro-myostatin from the slower migrating form to the faster migrating form (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that LTBP-2 preferentially associates with unglycosylated pro-myostatin, whereas LTBP-3 preferentially associates with glycosylated pro-myostatin. Because N-linked glycosylations are typically added as proteins move through the secretory apparatus, these data suggest that LTBP-2 binding is restricted to pro-myostatin that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in a form that is not competent for glycosylation or secretion, whereas LTBP-3 binds to pro-myostatin that can be secreted. LTBPs are covalently linked to canonical TGF-βs by a disulfide bond between an 8-cysteine motif in the LTBPs and a cysteine near the N terminus of the TGF-β prodomain (15Miyazono K. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J.

Acta. 1998; 1383: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The myostatin prodomain contains two cysteines at a similar position as the cysteine in TGF-β that links to LTBPs, raising the possibility that pro-myostatin also forms a disulfide linkage with LTBP. To determine whether myostatin interacts with LTBP-3 in a manner similar to the canonical TGF-β ligands, we created a myostatin in which the cysteines near the N terminus of the prodomain have been changed to alanines (Fig. 1B). Co-expression of pro-myostatin in which the prodomain cysteines have been mutated to alanine has no effect on LTBP-3 binding to myostatin (Fig. 1A), however, indicating that a disulfide linkage is not necessary for stable interaction between these proteins. Furthermore, an LTBP-3 construct that lacks the carboxyl-terminal region containing the TGF-β binding motif, LTBP-3ΔC (Fig. 1B), binds as effectively to pro-myostatin as does wild type LTBP-3 (Fig. 2B), indicating that pro-myostatin binds to a different region of LTBP-3 than does TGF-β. The pro-myostatin-LTBP-3 interaction is not retained during Laemmli gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions (not shown), further indicating that this interaction, unlike the binding of TGF-β to LTBPs, does not involve a disulfide linkage. Pro-myostatin Is Retained in the Extracellular Matrix of Cells Expressing Latent TGF-β-binding Protein-3—LTBPs assist in the secretion of canonical TGF-β ligands (32Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To determine whether LTBPs influence the secretion of myostatin, we monitored myostatin levels in NP-40-solubilized cell lysates, conditioned media, and the NP-40-insoluble cell fraction of cells expressing myostatin in the presence or absence of LTBP-3. In contrast to expectations based on observations of the effect of LTBP on TGF-β secretion, co-expression of LTBP-3 dramatically reduced the amount of pro-myostatin in the conditioned media of 293T cells (Fig. 2B). Concomitant with this reduction of pro-myostatin in conditioned media by LTBP-3 expression, however, we observed an increase in pro-myostatin in the NP-40-insoluble cell pellet. This pellet could reflect either an intracellular NP-40-insoluble fraction (e.g. cytoskeleton) or the NP-40-insoluble ECM. To distinguish between these possibilities, we treated intact 293T cel"
https://openalex.org/W1992781055,"TRPV4, a member of the vanilloid subfamily of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, is activated by a variety of stimuli, including cell swelling, moderate heat, and chemical compounds such as synthetic 4α-phorbol esters. TRPV4 displays a widespread expression in various cells and tissues and has been implicated in diverse physiological processes, including osmotic homeostasis, thermo- and mechanosensation, vasorelaxation, tuning of neuronal excitability, and bladder voiding. The mechanisms that regulate TRPV4 in these different physiological settings are currently poorly understood. We have recently shown that the relative amount of TRPV4 in the plasma membrane is enhanced by interaction with the SH3 domain of PACSIN 3, a member of the PACSIN family of proteins involved in synaptic vesicular membrane trafficking and endocytosis. Here we demonstrate that PACSIN 3 strongly inhibits the basal activity of TRPV4 and its activation by cell swelling and heat, while leaving channel gating induced by the synthetic ligand 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate unaffected. A single proline mutation in the SH3 domain of PACSIN 3 abolishes its inhibitory effect on TRPV4, indicating that PACSIN 3 must bind to the channel to modulate its function. In line herewith, mutations at specific proline residues in the N terminus of TRPV4 abolish binding of PACSIN 3 and render the channel insensitive to PACSIN 3-induced inhibition. Taken together, these data suggest that PACSIN 3 acts as an auxiliary protein of TRPV4 channel that not only affects the channel's subcellular localization but also modulates its function in a stimulus-specific manner."

LPA is a bioactive phospholipid regulating a wide range of cellular responses (proliferation, survival, motility, ion flux, and secretion) through the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors as follows: LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 (22Tigyi G. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2001; 64: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Hausman D.B. DiGirolamo M. Bartness T.J. Hausman G.J. Martin R.J. Obes.

Acta. 2006; 1758: 923-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For instance, LPA is able to activate preadipocyte motility and proliferation, and to inhibit adipocyte differentiation by interacting preferentially with LPA1 (25Pagès C. Daviaud D. An S. Krief S.

Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, autotaxin may be involved in the control of adipose tissue development and/or metabolism. Furthermore, autotaxin might be the unique source of circulating LPA from LPC, at least in the early stages of fetal development, because mice deleted of the ATX gene are not viable (19van Meeteren L.A. Ruurs P. Stortelers C. Bouwman P. van Rooijen M.A. Pradère J.P. Pettit T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Mummery C.L. Moolenar W.H. Jonkers J. Mol. Cell.

Giganti A. Cogé F. Berthaux F. Thiam K. Boutin J.A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3572-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, autotaxin has been identified as a lyso-PLD from various other sources such as fetal bovine serum (5Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Domhmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B.

Autotaxin catalytic activity is present at high concentrations in various biological fluids, including plasma, serum, and seminal plasma (30Aoki J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recently, a link has been established between LPA and progression of breast cancer bone metastases (31Boucharaba A. Serre C. Gres S. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Bordet J.C. Guglielmi J. Clezardin P. Peyruchaud O. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1714-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), whereas a relationship had already been shown between autotaxin and the invasiveness of breast cancer cells (32Yang S.Y.

Biochem. 2004; 92: 900-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Once purified, it was shown that autotaxin was an autocrine motility factor that promotes cancer cell invasion, cell migration, and angiogenesis (2Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Unsworth E.J. Arestad A. Cioce V. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2524-2529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, autotaxin was initially described from melanoma cell supernatants (1Bollen M. Gijsbers R. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Stefan C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 393-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 8Stracke M.L. Clair T. Liotta L.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Enhanced expression of autotaxin has been demonstrated in various malignant tumor tissues (34Tokumura A. Kume T. Fukuzawa K. Tahara M. Tasaka K. Aoki J. Arai H. Yasuda K. Kanzaki H. Life Sci. 2007; 80: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that in addition to its possible involvement in the physiopathology of adipose tissue, autotaxin might also play an important role in cancer. Compounds—All chemicals were obtained at the highest purity grade available from Sigma. Phospholipids are as follows: LPC-hexanoyl (6:0), -octanoyl (8:0), -decanoyl (10:0), -lauroyl (12:0), -myristoyl (14:0), -palmitoyl (16:0), -stearoyl (18:0), -arachidoyl (20:0), and -lignoceroyl (24:0) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Hypericin was purchased from Calbiochem. Cloning of Human and Murine Autotaxin cDNAs—Total RNA from murine skeletal muscle (Clontech) was used to clone murine autotaxin α cDNA, whereas total RNA from 3T3F442A cells (35Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) was used to clone murine autotaxin β and murine autotaxin γ cDNAs. Total RNA from A2058 cells (ATCC) was used to clone human autotaxin α cDNA, whereas total RNA from human total brain (Clontech) was used to clone human autotaxin β and human autotaxin γ cDNAs. RNA were reverse-transcribed using (dT)12–18 and reverse transcriptase Superscript II (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNA was amplified at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min for 35 cycles. The primers for the murine autotaxin variants are listed in the supplemental Table 1). The primers for the human autotaxin variants forward were 5′-GGTACCGTCGACCGACATGGCAAGGAGGAGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GATGACGCGGCCGCGTTAAATCTCGCTCTCATATGT-3′ (the underlined nucleotides are the SalI and NotI sites, respectively). The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pMC1 expression vector and sequenced on both strands by automated sequencing. Expression Analysis by RT-PCR—RT-PCR analysis was carried out to assess mRNA distribution profiles of autotaxin splice variants. Total RNA from murine and human tissues were obtained from Clontech. Total RNA from human subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained as described previously (28Boucher J. Quilliot D. Praderes J.P. Simon M.F. Gres S. Guigne C. Prevot D. Ferry G. Boutin J.A. Carpene C. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using (dT)12–18 and reverse transcriptase Superscript II. (Invitrogen). A minus RT reaction was performed in parallel to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination. The PCR conditions were 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. For the human autotaxin variants, the first set of primers, forward h1 5′-CTCACCCTGCCAGATCATGA-3′ and reverse h2 5′-CTCAGTTCTATCACATGTGAC-3′, was used with the oligonucleotide probe hAS 5′-GTTGCCCCTAAGAGGAGACA-3′, recognizing specifically the autotaxin α variant, or hC1 5′-GGTGTGTCAACGTCATCT-3′ based on a common region to the three human variants. The second set of primers, forward h3 5′-GGATTGAAGCCAGCTCCTAAT-3′ and reverse h4 5′-CAACTGGTCAGATGGTCAGG-3′, was used with the oligonucleotide probes hGS, 5′-AGGAAATTCAGAGGCAGCAG-3′, recognizing specifically the autotaxin γ variant, or hC2 5′-GCAGTGCTTTATCGGACTAG-3′ based on a common region to the three human variants. For the murine autotaxin variants, the first set of primers, forward m1, 5′-CCTAACTATCCTTCAGTGGC-3′ and reverse m2 5′-CGTTAGTCAGATAGTTGCTC-3′, was used with the oligonucleotide probes mAS, 5′-GTTGCCCCTAAGAGGAGACA-3′, recognizing specifically the murine autotaxin α isoform, or mC1 5′-CACCGTTGTGTGAATGTTATC-3′ based on a common region to the three murine variants. The second set of primers, forward m3 5′-GGACTAAAGTGCCTCCATTTG-3′ and reverse m4 5-CATCAGGGCGAACACAGTTG-3′, was used with the oligonucleotide probes mGS, 5′-GAAAATTCAGAGGCAGCA-3′ recognizing specifically the autotaxin γ variant, or mC2, 5′-GCAGTGCTTTATCGGACTAG-3′, based on a common region to the three murine variants (see complete sequences and details in supplemental Table 2). PCR products were separated by agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. The blots were washed twice at 50 °C in 2× SSC containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 30 min each and exposed to a x-ray film. Quantitative PCR for the Determination of Global Autotaxin Expression Level in Human Tissues—Because of the structure of the mRNA corresponding to the three isoforms, no design was possible to selectively determine the amount of the three mRNAs in tissues. Therefore, we performed a global qPCR in a region common to the three isoforms. The mRNA species of human tissues were purchased from Clontech and reverse-transcribed the SuperScript first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The ABI 7500 PCR and detection system (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR premix Ex Taq™ kit (Takara) was used in qPCR. PCR was conducted in triplicate for each sample. Primers were indicated in supplemental Table 1. All primer sets satisfied the requirements for the DDCt method with the absolute value of the slope of log input amount versus Ct <0.1 and the efficiency >99%. The primer set of ATX was selected to amplify all ATX isoforms published to date. PCRs were performed according to the supplier's instructions (Applied Biosystems) with primers at 300 nm each and 1 μl of the reverse transcription reaction in 10 μl of volume reaction. PCR protocol was as follows: 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Human GAPDH was amplified as an internal standard. Human GAPDH was amplified as an internal standard. Reported values were calculated using DDCt method normalized against endogenous GAPDH. The qPCR experiments for global ATX and ATX isoform γ were performed with the sequences reported in supplemental Table 3. Autotaxin Production—COS-7 cells (ATCC) served as the expression system for the wild type autotaxin. Cells were maintained in culture at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PPA Laboratories), penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine 2 mm (Invitrogen). Cells were transiently transfected with control or autotaxin-expressing pMC1 plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and Lipofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's method. Two days after transfection, the cell layer was washed three times with red phenol-free DMEM supplemented with glutamine (2 mm) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h in the same DMEM. After incubation, the conditioned medium was harvested, dialyzed, concentrated as described previously, and stored at -20 °C until further use. Recombinant Autotaxin—The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) was used for autotaxin production. Autotaxin cDNA fused to the FLAG-M2 sequence at the C terminus was cloned into the pFastBacI vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was then used for generating recombinant baculovirus to infect Sf9 insect cells, which were grown in SF-900 II medium (Invitrogen); the multiplicity of infection was ∼2, and the time of infection was ∼, 2 × 106 cells/ml. After 48 h of infection at 27 °C, medium containing secreted autotaxin was centrifuged (500 × g for 10 min) and frozen at -80 °C. The conditioned medium supplemented with proteases inhibitors was then centrifuged (32,000 rpm for 60 min) to remove cells debris and applied onto an anti-FLAG® M2 Affinity Gel column (Sigma) equilibrated with the following buffer: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted with 10 μg/ml FLAG peptide. Purity of autotaxin-containing fractions was >95% as shown by SDS-PAGE and Sypro Ruby staining. All steps in enzyme purification were carried out at 4 °C. All proteins were expressed with a C-terminal FLAG-M2 tag. SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE 4–20% was performed according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) followed by Sypro Ruby or colloidal blue staining. After addition of the sample buffer (Novex, Invitrogen), concentrated fractions from the gel filtration step were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Electrophoretic separation of proteins was carried out on a 1-mm-thick 8 × 6-cm gel 10% acrylamide precasted gels (NOVEX and Invitrogen). A 40-μg portion of the total protein in sample buffer was loaded into a 4-mm well of the gel and separated at 40 mA. A total of 30 μg of standards (Mark12, Invitrogen) migrated in a neighboring lane. After coloration with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Biosafe, Bio-Rad), proteins were cut, reduced, and alkylated using dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide, respectively, and subjected to digestion with trypsin overnight. Extracted peptides were SpeedVac®-concentrated and then desalted on Poros 50 R2 chromatographic phase. Peptides were eluted by 2 μl of a 60% methanol, 40% water, 2% formic acid solution directly in nanoelectrospray needles. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as reported previously after protein separation with SDS-PAGE 4–20% gels (Invitrogen), which were routinely run until the dye front migrated out of the gel followed either by Sypro Ruby staining or by transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane with iBlot™ Gel Transfer Device (Invitrogen). The membranes were treated during 3 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v) dried skim milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl. The membrane were washed and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with chicken polyclonal anti-autotaxin diluted at 0.1 μg/ml or with monoclonal antibody anti-FLAG-M2 diluted at 10 μg/ml, followed by extensive washing with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by treatment for 1 h with anti-chicken IgG-peroxidase (1/50,000) or anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase complex (1/30,000) (Sigma) and then visualized using a peroxidase immunostaining kit (Amersham Biosciences). Horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit or anti-chicken IgG was used as a secondary antibody for all primary antibodies. The proteins bands were with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences), followed by exposure to Hyperfilm ECL. Antibodies—Polyclonal anti-autotaxin antibody was raised against the full-length β isoform protein. Chicken antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography. The monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 was purchased from Sigma and allowed to detect the purified protein. Phosphodiesterase Enzymatic Assay—The phosphodiesterase activity of recombinant autotaxin was measured by using pNppp substrate in test using a modification of the method of Razzell and Khorana (37Razzell W.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2105-2113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant autotaxin proteins were used as an enzyme source. Samples (10 μl) were incubated in 96-well plates in a final volume of 100 μl containing p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate at 5 mm final concentration in a 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 buffer. After 30 min at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by addition of 100 μl of 0.1 m NaOH. The production of p-nitrophenol was kinetically measured by following the absorbance at 410 nm using a Pherastar plate reader (BMG, Offenburg, Germany) and after subtraction of blank. Fluorogenic Enzymatic Assay—This assay was based on the Amplex™ Red PLD assay kit (Molecular Probes, Interchim, Montluçon, France) originally designed for the measurement of the PLD activity. In this enzyme-coupled assay, PLD cleaves phosphatidylcholine (PLC) to yield choline and phosphatidic acid. The choline produced by the reaction was in turn oxidized by choline oxidase into betaine and H2O2. Finally, H2O2 reacted, in the presence of horseradish peroxidase, with Amplex Red to generate a compound, resorufin, the fluorescence of which was measured. For the measurement of lyso-PLD activity, the assay was modified by replacing phosphatidylcholine with lysopalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (Sigma). The assay was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, and purified lyso-PLD in 96-well plates. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 μl of the Amplex Red mixture (lysopalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, oleoyl 500 μm, choline oxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and Amplex Red reagent). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the fluorescence was measured with a spectrofluorimeter (PolarStar Galaxy, BMG, Offenburg, Germany) using 530- and 590-nm filters for excitation and emission, respectively. Nonlinear regression analyses of the kinetic data with calculation of Vmax and Km values were performed using the statistical software package Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Amino Acid Sequence Analysis and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—These analyses were custom performed at Proteodynamics (Clermont-Ferrand, France). Purified human autotaxin β was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained by Coomassie Blue before N-terminal sequencing. The 105- and 66-kDa bands were cut out separately and analyzed. Amino acid sequence analysis was performed by the Edman degradation procedure using an Applied Biosystems Procise 492A protein sequencer. After affinity purification, Tris buffer was removed on 4-ml aliquot of purified human autotaxin by acetone precipitation (3 ml of cold acetone (-20 °C) were added per ml of protein). After vortexing, the mixture was allowed to stand at -20 °C and then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C (centrifuge Jouan MR23i). The pellet was washed once with 200 μl of cold acetone as described above. The pellet was resuspended in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were prepared by mixing 1 μl of resuspended pellet and 1 μl of sinapinic acid matrix solution (10 mg/ml acetonitrile/H2O 50/50, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), before loading on the target. Spectra were acquired in positive linear mode on a Voyager-DE PRO MALDI-TOF spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The target voltage was 25 kV, first grid 92%, and the delay extraction 1300 ns. The external calibration was done with an IgG. Biochemical Characterizations of Murine and Human Autotaxin Isoform Catalytic Activities—Purified autotaxin isoforms were incubated in the phosphodiesterase assay in the presence of increasing concentrations of substrates. Initial rates of pNP formation, measured after 30 min of incubation by light absorbance at 410 nm, are plotted against increasing substrate concentrations and fitted according to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad software. Nonlinear regression analyses of the kinetic data with calculation of Vmax and Km were performed utilizing the statistical software package Prism 4.0. Effects of Chelating Agents in Metal Ions on PDE Activity of Autotaxin—Purified autotaxin was preincubated with EDTA or EGTA for 30 min at 37 °C in a PBC buffer (6.66 mm citric acid, 6.66 mm phosphoric acid, 11.44 mm boric acid, 68.6 mm NaOH in final concentration), and its PDE activity was assayed. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three replicates and are representative of three experiments. Similarly, purified autotaxin isoforms were incubated with increasing concentrations of metal ions. The metal solutions were prepared in the incubation buffer. Concentrations were checked from 150 mm to 100 μm, and their influence was compared with control, without added metals. All the experiments were done three times, each time in triplicate. Human and Murine Autotaxin Gene Structure—The schematic organization of the murine autotaxin gene, deduced from sequence comparison between the spliced variants cDNAs and the genomic clone AC123644, is shown in Fig. 1. For the general reader, the activity catalyzed by autotaxin is schematized in the Fig. 1C. In mouse, this gene spans more than 80 kbp and cont"

The cores of both vortices are depleted in phosphine gas, probably resulting from subsidence of air into the troposphere. The warm cores are present throughout the upper troposphere and stratosphere at both poles. The thermal structure associated with the marked hexagonal polar jet at 77°N has been observed for the first time.

https://openalex.org/W2090671789,"The total heat gained by the North Atlantic Ocean over the past 50 years is equivalent to a basinwide increase in the flux of heat across the ocean surface of 0.4 ± 0.05 watts per square meter. We show, however, that this basin has not warmed uniformly: Although the tropics and subtropics have warmed, the subpolar ocean has cooled. These regional differences require local surface heat flux changes (±4 watts per square meter) much larger than the basinwide average. Model investigations show that these regional differences can be explained by large-scale, decadal variability in wind and buoyancy forcing as measured by the North Atlantic Oscillation index. Whether the overall heat gain is due to anthropogenic warming is difficult to confirm because strong natural variability in this ocean basin is potentially masking such input at the present time."
https://openalex.org/W1986095829,"By mining DNA microarray data bases at GenBank™, we identified up-regulation of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) in human primary and metastatic prostate cancer specimens as compared with nonmalignant prostate tissues. To explore the role of up-regulated MT1-MMP in early stage cancer progression, we have employed a three-dimensional cell culture model. Minimally invasive human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) were transfected with MT1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeric cDNA as compared with GFP cDNA, and morphologic and phenotypic changes were characterized. GFP-expressing LNCaP cells formed multicellular spheroids with cuboidal-like epithelial morphology, whereas MT1-GFP-expressing cells displayed a fibroblast-like morphology and a scattered growth pattern in type I collagen gels. Cell morphologic changes were accompanied by decreased epithelial markers and enhanced mesenchymal markers, consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. MT1-MMP-induced morphologic change and cell scattering were abrogated by target inhibition of either the catalytic domain or the hemopexin domain. We further demonstrated that MT1-MMP-induced phenotypic changes were dependent upon up-regulation of Wnt5a, which has been implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. We conclude that MT1-MMP plays an important role in early cancer dissemination by converting epithelial cells to migratory mesenchymal-like cells.

Turning an epithelial cell into a mesenchymal cell requires alterations in morphology, cellular architecture, adhesion, and migration. A molecular hallmark of EMT is the decrease or loss of expression of the adherens junction protein, E-cadherin, resulting in loss of cell-cell association and change of cell morphology. Decreased levels of E-cadherin and cytokeratins and acquisition of mesenchymal proteins like fibronectin and vimentin are indicative of a switch toward a mesenchymal dedifferentiated phenotype; these phenotypic changes result in enhanced cell motility and invasiveness (3Thiery J.P.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5366) Google Scholar). epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition matrix metalloproteinase membrane type 1-MMP enhanced green fluorescent protein short hairpin RNA glycosylphosphatidylinositol glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse transcription hemopexin urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition matrix metalloproteinase membrane type 1-MMP enhanced green fluorescent protein short hairpin RNA glycosylphosphatidylinositol glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse transcription hemopexin urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. Enhanced production and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP), have been described in most types of carcinoma, including commonly occurring prostate and breast cancer (4Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar). High levels of MMPs in cancer tissues have been correlated with poor prognosis. MMPs have been linked with EMT through both autocrine and/or paracrine pathways (5Cheng S. Lovett D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1937-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Secreted MMPs (e.g. MMP-2, -3, -9, and -28) have been associated with cancer cell EMT through various mechanisms (6Illman S.A. Lehti K. Keski-Oja J. Lohi J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3856-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Radisky D.C. Levy D.D. Littlepage L.E. Liu H. Nelson C.M. Fata J.E. Leake D. Godden E.L. Albertson D.G. Nieto M.A. Werb Z.

Metastasis. 2000; 18: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although MT1-MMP is capable of cleaving E-cadherin in transfected breast cancer cells (9Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko N.D. Strongin A.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the effect of this cleavage on EMT has not been characterized. The multiplicity of distinct pathways and molecules, each of which can lead independently to EMT-like events is astonishing. The Wnt pathway is exceptional in its complexity (10Nusse R. Nature. 2005; 438: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Three distinct intracellular pathways appear to transduce Wnt signals: the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, and the Wnt/polarity pathway. It is unclear what factors are involved in determining which of the three intracellular pathways are activated. Wnt5a (wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 5A) appears to initiate the Wnt/Ca2+ cascade. Up-regulation of Wnt5a has been associated with many types of human cancers (11Iozzo R.V. Eichstetter I. Danielson K.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3495-3499PubMed Google Scholar). Wnt5a overexpression enhances tumor cell proliferation, cell motility, and invasion (12Weeraratna A.T. Jiang Y.

Kishida M. Inoue A. Asahara T. Yasui W. Kikuchi A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10439-10448Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Wnt5a also augments repopulating capacity and primitive hematopoietic development of human blood stem cells in vivo (14Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. Ferrari De G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Wnt5a has recently been postulated to play a critical role in cancer cell EMT (15Ripka S. Konig A. Buchholz M. Wagner M. Sipos B.

There has been considerable debate recently concerning the requirement of MT1-MMP enzymatic activity in cancer cell migration in three-dimensional culture models (17Sabeh F. Ota I. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Soloway P. Balbin M. Lopez-Otin C. Shapiro S. Inada M. Krane S. Allen E. Chung D. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 18Sahai E.

In the current study, we employed a three-dimensional ECM culture system in which cancer cells were embedded within a native type I collagen gel to better characterize the mechanism by which MT1-MMP enhances cancer dissemination. Reagents—Type I collagen (acetic acid-extracted native type I collagen from rat tail tendon) was purchased from BD Biosciences Discovery Labware (Bedford, MA). EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin was purchased from Pierce. Recombinant TIMP-2 was purchased from CHEMICON International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ and pIRES2/GFP vectors were purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Primary antibodies were purchased from Sigma (anti-cytokeratin-8, anti-cytokeratin-18, and anti-vimentin antibodies), Chemicon International (fibronectin antibody and anti-MT1-MMP hemopexin domain polyclonal antibody), Calbiochem (anti-β-actin antibody), and Zymed Laboratories Inc. (anti-E-cadherin antibody against extracellular portion). Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Invitrogen. Recombinant pro-MMP-2 was produced by COS-1 cells transfected with pro-MMP-2 cDNA as previously described (20Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cell Lines—To permit visualization of protein trafficking and cell migration/invasion using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP from Clontech), we previously generated a fusion protein between MT1-MMP and EGFP by fusing EGFP cDNA to the C terminus of MT1-MMP cDNA (MT1-GFP) (21Cao J. Chiarelli C. Kozarekar P. Adler H.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This chimera has been demonstrated to have similar features to wild-type MT1-MMP (22Galvez B.G. Matias-Roman S. Yanez-Mo M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). MT1-GFP and EGFP control cDNAs were stably transfected into less aggressive human prostate cancer LNCaP cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), as described previously (21Cao J. Chiarelli C. Kozarekar P. Adler H.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Construction of Small Interference RNA Vectors and Retroviral Infection—Small interfering oligonucleotides specific for MT1-MMP and a control to express short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were designed using a Worldwide Web-based online software system (Block-iT RNAi Designer; Invitrogen) for mammalian RNA interference. Three specific 21-nucleotide sequences spanning positions 1461–1481 (MT1-MMP-shRNA-1), 472–492 (MT1-MMP-shRNA-2), and 1643–1663 (MT1-MMP-shRNA-3) of the human MT1-MMP gene (GenBank accession number NM_004995) and three specific 21-nucleotide sequences spanning positions 64–85 (wnt5a-shRNA1), 307–328 (wnt5a-shRNA2), and 403–424 (wnt5a-shRNA3) of the human wnt5a gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_003392) were cloned as inverted repeats into the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-Retro Q vector. As a control, we used luciferase protein from firefly Pyrocoelia pectoralis as a target gene (nucleotides 539–557, GenBank™ accession number EF155570). A retroviral supernatant was obtained by co-transfection of a vector encoding the envelope gene (pAmphotropic) and a retroviral expression vector containing the MT1-MMP shRNA, wnt5a shRNA, or luciferase shRNA control into human embryonic kidney GP2–293 packaging cells (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. LNCaP cells stably expressing MT1-GFP were infected with the viral supernatant, and the cells were then selected with 4 μg/ml puromycin for 1–2 weeks. The effects of shRNA on gene expression were evaluated by real time RT-PCR using RNA of pooled resistant cells. The most effective stable MT1-MMP and Wnt5a knockdown cell lines were selected. To generate a chimera between soluble MT1-MMP and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linker, a two-step PCR approach was employed, as previously described (20Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The resultant chimeric cDNA was then inserted into the upstream of the internal ribosomal entry site in the pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech) (MT1-GPIuPAR/GFP) to facilitate green fluorescence for determination of transfected cells. RNA Isolation and Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from three-dimensional cultured cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using a Bio-Rad iScript cDNA synthesis kit based on product instructions. The resulting cDNAs were used for PCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in triplicates. PCR and data collection were performed on MyIQ2 real time PCR system (Bio-Rad). The relative quantitation value for each target gene compared with the endogenous controls (GAPDH and β-actin) for that target was analyzed by a ΔΔCT method (MyIQ2 software; Bio-Rad). The primer sets used for real time RT-PCR were as follows: MT1-MMP (NM_004995), forward (cactgcctacgagaggaagg) and reverse (ttggggtactcgctatccac); cytokeratin-8 (M342250), forward (ccgacgagatcaacttcctc) and reverse (ggctctgcagctcctcatac); cytokeratin-18 (X12881), forward (aaaggcctacaagcccagat) and reverse (cactgtggtgctctcctcaa); vimentin (NM_003380), forward (ccctcacctgtgaagtggat) and reverse (tccagcagcttcctgtaggt); fibronectin (NM_212482), forward (cagaatccaagcggagagag) and reverse (catcctcagggctcgagtag); wnt5a (NM_003392), forward (tggctttggccatatttttc) and reverse (ccgatgtactgcatgtggtc); GAPDH (NM_002046), forward (ctcatgaccacagtccatgc) and reverse (tttctagacggcaggtcagg); β-actin (NM_001101), forward (ggacttcgagcaagagatgg) and reverse (agcactgtgttggcgtacag). Cell Scattering Assay—Collagen gel cultures in 24-well plates were performed as previously described (23Montesano R. Schaller G. Orci L. Cell. 1991; 66: 697-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In brief, 4 × 104 cells/ml were resuspended in neutralized acid-extracted type I collagen (2.5 mg/ml, final concentration). After collagen gelation, 300 μl of complete medium were added above the gels. For inhibition studies, MMP inhibitors, TIMP-2, or anti-functional antibodies against MT1-MMP hemopexin domain were added. Cells were cultured for the indicated times with media and drug-treatments renewed every other day. HE Staining of Frozen Sections—For histological sections, type I collagen gels were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Sections were cut at 6 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunofluorescent Staining and Laser-scanning Confocal Microscopy—Cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline followed by blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. E-cadherin at cell-cell adherens junctions was detected by an antibody against the extracellular portion of E-cadherin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 568 (Invitrogen). The immunostained cells were examined, and a z section series was obtained using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. Procedures for Gelatin Substrate Zymography, Fluorescein Isothiocyanate-labeled Substrate Degradation-Migration Assay, Cell Surface Biotinylation, and Western Blotting—Basic protocols for these techniques have been described previously (24Cao J.

By mining DNA microarray data bases at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO/NCBI) and Oncomine (Cancer Profiling Database) for MT1-MMP expression in human prostate cancer specimens employing a cut-off of p < 0.01, we identified up-regulation of MT1-MMP in cancer tissues as compared with adjacent normal prostate tissue in two microarray data sets (26Yu Y.P. Landsittel D. Jing L. Nelson J. Ren B. Liu L. McDonald C. Thomas R. Dhir R. Finkelstein S. Michalopoulos G. Becich M. Luo J.H. J. Clin.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the microdissected primary tumor data set of Yu et al. (26Yu Y.P. Landsittel D. Jing L. Nelson J. Ren B. Liu L. McDonald C. Thomas R. Dhir R. Finkelstein S. Michalopoulos G. Becich M. Luo J.H. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 2790-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), MT1-MMP levels were significantly increased in primary tumor samples from patients with metastasis as compared with nonmetastatic prostate cancer (Fig. 1). Correlation of up-regulated MT1-MMP with prostate cancer metastasis has been confirmed using a surgical orthotopic implantation prostate cancer animal model (21Cao J. Chiarelli C. Kozarekar P. Adler H.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism underlying MT1-MMP-enhanced prostate cancer dissemination, we carried out a series of experiments using cell lines stably expressing MT1-MMP. MT1-MMP Induces Cell Morphologic Changes and Cell Scattering in Three-dimensional Culture—Human LNCaP prostate cancer cells are well differentiated with high expression of E-cadherin, prostate-specific antigen, and cytokeratin 18 and a minimal level of vimentin expression (28Enmon Jr., R.M. O'Connor K.C. Song H. Lacks D.J. Schwartz D.K. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2002; 80: 580-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To study the role of MT1-MMP in early prostate cancer dissemination, stably transfected LNCaP cells expressing high and low levels of MT1-MMP and enhanced green fluorescent protein chimera (MT1-GFP) were selected using a quantitative real time RT-PCR approach. Gene expression levels of MT1-GFP chimera in high expressing LNCaP cells were roughly equivalent to nontransfected DU145 prostate cancer cells and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells (supplemental Fig. 1). As assessed by immunoblotting, protein levels of MT1-GFP chimera in stable high expressing LNCaP cells were 9-fold less than transiently transfected LNCaP cells (Fig. 2A). Expanded clones expressing MT1-GFP or GFP were used in this study. Although MT1-MMP-expressing LNCaP cells are capable of activating exogenous pro-MMP-2 (21Cao J. Chiarelli C. Kozarekar P. Adler H.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the morphology of GFP- and MT1-GFP-expressing cells in two-dimensional cultures was almost identical to that of nontransfected LCNaP cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when these cells were embedded in type I collagen gels (three-dimensional culture model), which more closely mimics physiological conditions, distinctive phenotypic differences were observed. Beginning on day 2, MT1-GFP-expressing LNCaP cells displayed an elongated, fibroblast-like morphology with distribution of the MT1-GFP fusion protein concentrated at the leading edge (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 2). MT1-GFP/LNCaP cells gradually displayed a scattering growth pattern in three-dimensional collagen gels. In contrast, LNCaP cells expressing GFP formed multicellular spheroids with round or cuboidal-like morphology in three-dimensional type I collagen gels (Fig. 2C), recapitulating the epithelial phenotype of carcinoma cells (3Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5366) Google Scholar). Hematoxylin/eosin staining of three-dimensional collagen gel sections confirmed these observations. To further explore the specific function of MT1-MMP in LNCaP cell scattering, we generated three MT1-MMP-specific shRNA constructs using a retroviral vector. Two of the MT1-MMP-shRNA constructs (MT1-MMP-shRNA-1 and -3 with 87 and 77% inhibition of MT1-MMP mRNA, respectively) efficiently inhibited functional MT1-MMP in terms of pericellular pro-MMP-2 activation (Fig. 3A). Following the growth of MT1-GFP/LNCaP cells expressing MT1-MMP-shRNA-1 in three-dimensional type I collagen gels, the cells grew as multicellular spheroids with diminished GFP expression as compared with the disseminated cell phenotype described above (Fig. 3B). The defect of MT1-MMP-induced morphology change and scattering pattern correlated with reduced MT1-GFP expression as evaluated by microscopic examination of GFP fluorescence (Fig. 3B) and immunoblotting using anti-MT1-MMP antibody (data not shown). Together, these data highlight the role of MT1-MMP in conversion of epithelial cell shape to fibroblast-like morphology. Cancer Cell Expression of MT1-MMP Results in Shedding of E-cadherin—Cell morphologic change from epithelial to mesenchymal appearance is accompanied by loss of cell-cell contact and represents a hallmark of EMT (29Hugo H. Ackland M.L. Blick T. Lawrence M.G. Clements J.A. Williams E.D. Thompson E.W. J. Cell Physiol. 2007; 213: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Degradation or loss of E-cadherin expression is an important indicator of EMT (3Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5366) Google Scholar). To determine if epithelial cell morphology change induced by expression of MT1-MMP is accompanied by loss of E-cadherin, co-localization of MT1-MMP with E-cadherin in cells was examined by laser-scanning confocal microscopy. In agreement with previous reports (30Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar), MT1-MMP was uniformly localized at the cell surface in isolated cells (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, MT1-MMP distribution was reorganized from uniform cell surface localization in isolated cells to redistribution at both the apical surface and the lateral junction areas of adjacent cells. As visualized in confocal x-z sections, dominant distribution was limited to the cell-cell junction area following partial confluence of MT1-GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 4A). Endogenous E-cadherin, primarily enriched along the lateral membrane, was co-localized with MT1-MMP in LNCaP cells and displayed decreased intensity in MT1-MMP-expressing as compared with GFP-expressing LNCaP cells (Fig. 4A). We next examined whether MT1-MMP sheds E-cadherin at cell-cell adherens junctions. E-cadherin was examined by immunoblotting of cell conditioned media from LNCaP cells and stably transfected LNCaP cells. Overexpression of MT1-GFP in LNCaP cells was associated with a 5-fold increase in 80-kDa soluble E-cadherin (Fig. 4B); no discernable difference of E-cadherin was noted in the cell lysates containing cytosolic as well as membrane proteins (data not shown). To further examine whether shedding of E-cadherin at cell-cell adherens junctions correlated with loss of cell surface E-cadherin, biotinylation of cell surface proteins followed by streptavidin precipitation and immunoblotting using anti-E-cadherin antibody was performed (25Klingelhofer J. Troyanovsky R.B. Laur O.Y. Troyanovsky S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1181-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Decreased biotinylated surface E-cadherin (120 kDa) was observed in MT1-GFP-expressing LNCaP cells as compared with wild-type LNCaP cells and LNCaP cells transfected with GFP cDNA (Fig. 4B), confirming the role of MT1-MMP in E-cadherin cleavage. Expression of MT1-MMP in LNCaP Cells Alters the Phenotype—Cell morphologic change from a cuboid epithelial shape to a spindle-like, fibroblastic appearance and degradation of E-cadherin is often accompanied by a decrease or loss of epithelial markers and gain of mesenchymal markers (3Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5366) Google Scholar). To determine if expression of MT1-MMP results in loss/decrease of the epithelial phenotype of LNCaP cells and increase of mesenchymal markers, real time RT-PCR was performed. Down-regulation of epithelial markers (cytokeratin-8 and -18) and increased mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin) were found in MT1-GFP-expressing LNCaP cells cultivated in three-dimensional type I collagen gels (Fig. 5A). These phenotypic changes were further evaluated by immunoblotting using corresponding antibodies. Decreased cytokeratin-8 (1.8-fold) and -18 (4.4-fold) and increased vimentin (2.7-fold) and fibronectin (4.6-fold) proteins were detected in MT1-GFP/LNCaP cells cultured in three-dimensional gel (Fig. 5B). Both Proteolytic Activity and Cell Migration Are Required for MT1-MMP-induced Cell Scattering/Invasion; the Cytoplasmic Tail of MT1-MMP Is Not Required—We previously demonstrated in two-dimensional cultures that the catalytic and hemopexin (PEX) domains of MT1-MMP play independent roles in ECM degradation and cell migration, respectively (24Cao J. Kozarekar P. Pavlaki M. Chiarelli C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14129-14139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To explore the role of the catalytic and PEX domains of MT1-MMP in cell scattering/invasion in a three-dimensional model, natural MMP inhibitors and anti-PEX domain of MT1-MMP antibodies were employed. As shown in Fig. 6A, the three-dimensional invasive ability of MT1-GFP expressing LNCaP cells (scattered pattern) was abolished by the addition of recombinant TIMP-2 (Fig. 6, A (c)) but not vehicle control (Fig. 6A (a)). When cells were treated with anti-PEX domain antibodies, the cell scattered growth pattern was also replaced by spheroid cell aggregates (Fig. 6A (d)). No effect on MT1-MMP-induced cell scattering was noted in the normal IgG control. To dissect the role of the anti-PEX antibody in MT1-MMP-induced cell scattering, the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled substrate (fibronectin) degradation-migration assay was employed (24Cao J. Kozarekar P. Pavlaki M. Chiarelli C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14129-14139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 6B, this antibody inhibited MT1-MMP-induced cell migration but did not alter MT1-MMP proteolytic activity. In contrast, substrate degradation was blocked in the presence of recombinant TIMP-2. These data demonstrate that both the catalytic and hemopexin domains of MT1-MMP are required for LNCaP cell scattering/invasion. The cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP has been reported to play an important role in endocytosis (31Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 32Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), but its role in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion has been challenged (24Cao J. Kozarekar P. Pavlaki M.

To determine the role of the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP in cell scattering in three-dimensional culture, a chimera between soluble MT1-MMP and a GPI linker of uPAR was generated (Sol.MT1-GPIuPAR/GFP) (Fig. 6C (a)). As previously shown (34Nie J. Pei J. Blumenthal M. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6438-6443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), fusion of the GPI sequence to nonfunctional soluble MT1-MMP (35Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) restored the function of MT1-MMP in terms of pericellular pro-MMP-2 activation. Expression of Sol.MT1-GPIuPAR/GFP chimera in LNCaP cells resulted in cell scattering and change in morphology in three-dimensional type I collagen gels similar to wild-type MT1-MMP, whereas inactive MT1E240→A-GFP-expressing LNCaP cells (24Cao"
https://openalex.org/W2043134189,"As a pathway for Na+ reabsorption, the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC is critical for Na+ homeostasis and blood pressure control. Na+ transport is regulated by Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that decreases ENaC expression at the cell surface. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we proteolytically cleaved/activated ENaC at the cell surface and then quantitated the rate of disappearance of cleaved channels using electrophysiological and biochemical assays. We found that cleaved ENaC channels were rapidly removed from the cell surface. Deletion or mutation of the Nedd4-2 binding motifs in α, β, and γENaC dramatically reduced endocytosis, whereas a mutation that disrupts a YXXØ endocytosis motif had no effect. ENaC endocytosis was also decreased by silencing of Nedd4-2 and by expression of a dominant negative Nedd4-2 construct. Conversely, Nedd4-2 overexpression increased ENaC endocytosis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells but had no effect in Fischer rat thyroid epithelia. In addition to its effect on endocytosis, Nedd4-2 also increased the rate of degradation of the cell surface pool of cleaved αENaC. Together the data indicate that Nedd4-2 reduces ENaC surface expression by altering its trafficking at two distinct sites in the endocytic pathway, inducing endocytosis of cleaved channels and targeting them for degradation.

Conversely, Nedd4-2 overexpression increased ENaC endocytosis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells but had no effect in Fischer rat thyroid epithelia. In addition to its effect on endocytosis, Nedd4-2 also increased the rate of degradation of the cell surface pool of cleaved αENaC. Together the data indicate that Nedd4-2 reduces ENaC surface expression by altering its trafficking at two distinct sites in the endocytic pathway, inducing endocytosis of cleaved channels and targeting them for degradation. The epithelial Na+ channel ENaC forms a pathway for Na+ reabsorption across epithelia, including the kidney, lung, and colon. Therefore, it plays a critical role in Na+ homeostasis and blood pressure control (reviewed in Refs. 1Schild L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Binding is also modulated by aldosterone and vasopressin via serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase and protein kinase A, respectively; both kinases phosphorylate Nedd4-2, which reduces its binding to ENaC (6Debonneville C.

It is possible that Nedd4-2 regulates ENaC trafficking in the biosynthetic pathway, targeting it for degradation in the proteasome. Consistent with this model, localization of Nedd4-2 at the cell surface is not required for Nedd4-2 to inhibit ENaC (14Itani O.A. Stokes J.B. Thomas C.P. Am. J.

Snyder, unpublished observation. Alternatively, Nedd4-2 could regulate ENaC in the endocytic pathway, altering ENaC endocytosis and/or targeting to lysosomes for degradation. This model is suggested by recent data from our laboratory and others indicating that Nedd4-2 binds to ENaC at the cell surface, where it catalyzes ubiquitination of each ENaC subunit (18Zhou R.

To overcome technical hurdles that have hindered progress in this area, we developed a novel strategy; we took advantage of the observation that ENaC is activated by proteolytic cleavage at specific sites in the extracellular domains of the α and γ subunits (20Chraibi A.

For overexpression experiments, the cells were cotransfected with 0.23 μg of each ENaC subunit along with either green fluorescent protein (GFP, control) or Nedd4-2 (0.3 μg). For RNA interference experiments, cells were cotransfected with 0.27 μg of each ENaC subunit and siRNA against GFP (control) or Nedd4-2 (0.2 μg) (26Snyder P.M. Steines J.C. Olson D.R. J. Biol.

In some studies, ENaC subunits contained the following mutations: αY644A, βR566X, βY620A, βP616–618A, γY627A, or γT629A. Following transfection, the cells were cultured for 48 h as described previously (12Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Short circuit current was measured using modified Ussing chambers (Warner Instrument Corp.). The apical and basolateral surfaces were bathed in 135 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm K2HPO4, 0.6 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Amiloride-sensitive short circuit current was determined as the current difference with and without amiloride (10 μm) in the apical bathing solution. To proteolytically cleave and activate ENaC at the cell surface, trypsin (10 μg/ml) was added to the apical membrane for 10 min and then removed by vigorous washes with ∼12 times the volume of the apical chamber. Amiloride-sensitive current was measured every 5 min by addition of amiloride (10 μm) to the apical membrane followed by wash out of amiloride. Biochemical Endocytosis Assay—HEK 293T cells were transfected (Lipofectamine 2000; Invitrogen) (18Zhou R. Patel S.V. Snyder P.M. J. Biol.

ENaC was cotransfected with cDNA encoding Nedd4-2, dominant negative Nedd4-2 (corresponding to amino acids 1 and 60–479 with Ser-221, Thr-246, and Ser-327 phosphorylation sites mutated to Ala), or GFP; or with siRNA against Nedd4-2 or GFP (quantities indicated in the figure legends). In some experiments, ENaC subunits contained the following mutations: βR566X, βY620A, βP616–618A, or γT629A. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μm amiloride. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-CM (PBS with 1 mm MgCl2 and CaCl2) and then incubated with trypsin (5 μg/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS-CM to remove trypsin, incubated at 37 °C for times between 0 and 60 min to allow endocytosis of cleaved channels, and then placed on ice. Cleaved channels remaining at the cell surface were labeled with biotin, as previously described (7Knight K.K. Olson D.R. Zhou R. Snyder P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2805-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in PBS-CM for 30 min on ice and then quenched with 100 mm glycine in PBS-CM for 10 min on ice. The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 63 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and protease inhibitor mixture). Biotinylated (cell surface) proteins were isolated by incubating the cell lysate with immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) for 12 h at 4 °C. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, biotinylated αENaC was detected by immunoblot with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate and quantitated by densitometry. Degradation Assay—HEK 293T cells were transfected with α-FLAG, β, and γENaC with Nedd4-2 or GFP. 48 h later, cells were biotinylated as above and then incubated at 37 °C for times between 0 and 80 min. Following lysis of the cells in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, biotinylated αENaC was isolated with NeutrAvidin beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblot (anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate). Proteolytic Cleavage of Cell Surface ENaC—In Fig. 1A, we transfected FRT epithelia with α, β, and γENaC and measured the short circuit current blocked by amiloride as an assay of ENaC activity. ENaC activity requires proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domains of the α and γ subunits. The basal amiloride-sensitive current (Fig. 1A) reflects ENaC channels cleaved in the biosynthetic pathway (27Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P.

Addition of trypsin to the extracellular solution increased amiloride-sensitive current 2-fold, reflecting acute proteolytic cleavage/activation of a pool of uncleaved (inactive) channels at the cell surface (Fig. 1A). This finding is consistent with previous work (7Knight K.K. Olson D.R. Zhou R. Snyder P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2805-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 23Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J.

In Fig. 1B, we mutated a consensus site for cleavage by furin in αENaC (αCl; R177A/178A), and in γENaC we mutated sites (γCl) for furin (R135/137/138A) and CAP1 (R178W, K179A, R180A, K181A) (27Hughey R.P.

However, trypsin activated the mutant channel, generating a large amiloride-sensitive current. This presumably occurred via trypsin cleavage at remaining Arg or Lys residues adjacent to the mutated furin and CAP1 sites. Quantitation of Endocytosis of Proteolytically Cleaved ENaC—Expression of the αClβγCl mutant ENaC in FRT cells provided a strategy to measure the rate of ENaC endocytosis (Fig. 1C). A pool of channels at the cell surface is proteolytically cleaved and activated with a brief exposure to trypsin. Over time, cleaved/active channels are removed from the cell surface by endocytosis, resulting in decreased amiloride-sensitive current. The rate of decrease in current reflects the rate of ENaC endocytosis. During this time course, newly synthesized channels also undergo exocytosis, but they are uncleaved/inactive and therefore do not contribute significantly to the current. Fig. 2A shows a representative current trace. Trypsin activated a large amiloride-sensitive current (arrowheads indicate brief addition of amiloride to quantitate ENaC current). Following removal of trypsin, amiloride-sensitive current decreased over time. Average data are shown in Fig. 2C, which is a plot of amiloride-sensitive current (relative to current immediately after trypsin removal) versus time after trypsin removal (error bars are hidden by the symbols), and data at 15 min are shown in Table 1. Current decreased rapidly over the first 15 min, followed by a much slower decrease. This suggests that cleaved ENaC is rapidly removed from the cell surface. The slower phase could represent a second more stable population of channels or could reflect recycling of cleaved channels back to the cell surface, which would counter the decrease in current caused by endocytosis. Interestingly, re-addition of trypsin to the bathing solution generated a large increase in amiloride-sensitive current. This likely reflects previously uncleaved/inactive channels inserted into the plasma membrane during the 45-min interval following the initial trypsin exposure.TABLE 1ENaC endocytosisGroupI/I0 (15 min)pCl/Cl0 (15 min)p αβγ0.60 ± 0.010.48 ± 0.1 αβR566Xγ0.78 ± 0.024 × 10-60.99 ± 0.080.01 αβY620Aγ0.76 ± 0.013 × 10-110.83 ± 0.090.04 αY644Aβγ0.70 ± 0.012 × 10-3 αβγY627A0.76 ± 0.025 × 10-4 αβP616-618Aγ0.69 ± 0.014 × 10-50.83 ± 0.030.04 αβγT629A0.55 ± 0.0050.40.40 ± 0.140.4GroupI/I0 (15 min)pCl/Cl0 (15 min)p Control0.55 ± 0.0050.48 ± 0.1 Nedd4-2 siRNA0.68 ± 0.0071 × 10-110.67 ± 0.120.01 Nedd4-2 DN0.91 ± 0.045 × 10-4GroupI/I0 (5 min)pCl/Cl0 (5 min)p Control0.78 ± 0.030.83 ± 0.08 Nedd4-20.83 ± 0.020.20.30 ± 0.091 × 10-3 Open table in a new tab Liddle Syndrome Mutations Decrease ENaC Endocytosis—Liddle syndrome mutations disrupt Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC by altering or deleting a C-terminal PY motif. To test the effect of Liddle syndrome mutations on ENaC endocytosis, we cotransfected FRT cells with αCl and γCl along with a mutant β subunit. In Fig. 2, B and C, we tested βR566X, which deletes most of the C terminus, including the PY motif. Following activation by trypsin, there was a gradual decline in amiloride-sensitive current. However, the rate of decrease was dramatically slower than for the wild-type β subunit. The difference between the curves was mainly in the initial rapid phase, which was largely absent for βR566X (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the curves for wild-type and βR566X paralleled one another in the later phase. When trypsin was added to the bathing solution a second time, there was an increase in ENaC current, albeit much smaller than for wild-type βENaC (Fig. 2B). Thus, Liddle syndrome mutations decrease ENaC exocytosis, consistent with previous work (30Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 31Lu C.

In Fig. 2D, we tested a missense mutation within the βENaC PY motif (βY620A) that also disrupts binding to Nedd4-2. This mutation slowed the rate of decrease in trypsin-activated ENaC current, similar to βR566X. Equivalent mutations of the PY motifs in αENaC (Y644A) and γENaC (Y627A) also slowed the decline in current (Fig. 2, E and F) although, interestingly, mutation of the αENaC PY motif had a smaller effect than the mutations in β or γENaC. Together, the data suggest that Liddle syndrome mutations decrease the rate of ENaC endocytosis. Biochemical Endocytosis Assay—As a second strategy to quantitate ENaC endocytosis, we used a biochemical assay to measure the rate of removal of proteolytically cleaved channels from the cell surface. We coexpressed α, β, and γENaC in HEK 293T cells; the α subunit contained a FLAG epitope at the C terminus. To detect αENaC at the cell surface, we biotinylated cell surface proteins, isolated them with NeutrAvidin beads, and then immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. For wild-type αENaC, we detected a 90-kDa band corresponding to the full-length protein and a 65-kDa band corresponding to the C-terminal cleavage fragment (Fig. 3A), consistent with previous work (7Knight K.K.

To prevent cleavage by furin, we mutated the two furin consensus sites (αCl-2), which has a similar effect on ENaC current as mutation of a single furin site (αCl-1) (34Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Pilewski J.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18901-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This eliminated the 65-kDa band (Fig. 3A). However, extracellular trypsin (5 μg/ml for 5 min) cleaved αCl-2, generating a 65-kDa band very similar in mass to the cleaved form of wild-type αENaC (Fig. 3A). After removing trypsin from the extracellular medium, we measured the rate of disappearance of the 65-kDa band from the cell surface as an assay of ENaC endocytosis (Fig. 1C shows model). Because newly synthesized channels undergoing exocytosis are 90 kDa, we were able to distinguish them from cleaved channels undergoing endocytosis. In Fig. 3B, top panel, we generated a pool of trypsin-cleaved αCl-2-FLAG at the cell surface, incubated the cells at 37 °C for 0–60 min to allow endocytosis, and then biotinylated channels remaining at the cell surface. We observed a rapid decrease in the 65-kDa cleaved band at the cell surface (Fig. 3B, average data are quantitated in Fig. 3C); 50% was removed by 15 min and nearly all was removed at 60 min. Thus, the half-life of cleaved αENaC at the cell surface was short (15 min). In contrast to the cleaved band, the quantity of the full-length 90-kDa band at the cell surface reflects the net contributions of both endocytosis and exocytosis of full-length αENaC. The quantity of this band increased at 5 min (2.1 ± 0.1-fold, n = 3), likely resulting from exocytosis of newly synthesized channels. There was little change in the density of this band at later time points, indicating that a steady state between endocytosis and exocytosis was reestablished. As a control, there was no change in the quantity of αCl-2-FLAG in the total cellular lysate during the course of the experiment (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). Minimal cleaved αCl-2-FLAG was observed in the total lysate, indicating that only a small fraction of total ENaC in the cell was expressed at the cell surface, consistent with previous work (7Knight K.K. Olson D.R. Zhou R. Snyder P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2805-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3B, right panels, and 3C, we tested the effect of Liddle syndrome mutations on endocytosis. Deletion of the C terminus of βENaC (R566X) decreased the rate of disappearance of the cleaved 65-kDa band from the cell surface. At 15 min, there was no significant decrease in surface expression and the half-life lengthened to >60 min. Mutation of the PY motif (βY620A) had a similar effect (Fig. 3C). Together with the results of the electrophysiological assay, we conclude that proteolytically cleaved/active ENaC is rapidly removed from the cell surface and that Liddle syndrome mutations dramatically slow the rate of removal. Nedd4-2 Binding Motif Mediates ENaC Endocytosis—The PPPXYXXL sequence mutated in Liddle syndrome fits the consensus for two motifs that have the potential to mediate ENaC endocytosis. First, it fits the YXXØ (Ø indicates hydrophobic amino acids) motif for endocytosis in clathrin-coated pits. This motif mediates endocytosis of the transferrin receptor (35Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S.Q. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Second, it fits the PPXY PY motif consensus that binds to proteins containing WW domains, including Nedd4-2 (36Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The Tyr (βY620A) is common to both motifs; mutation of this residue decreased ENaC endocytosis (Figs. 2D and 3C). Previous work indicates that the Leu contributes to WW domain binding and is also part of both motifs (37Kanelis V. Rotin D. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 38Henry P.C. Kanelis V. O'Brien M.C. Kim B. Gautschi I. Forman-Kay J. Schild L. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20019-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To distinguish the relative contributions of these two motifs, we tested two additional mutations. Previous work indicates that mutation of a Thr within the sequence (γT629A) disrupts the effect of a dominant negative dynamin cDNA (which blocks endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits) but does not alter its regulation by Nedd4-2 (39Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39161-39167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Conversely, mutation of the three prolines (βP616–618A) prevents ENaC regulation by Nedd4-2 but does not disrupt clathrin-mediated endocytosis (39Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39161-39167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We tested the effects of these mutations on ENaC endocytosis using both electrophysiological and biochemical assays. Compared with wild type, γT629A did not alter the decline in trypsin-activated current (Fig. 4A) or the removal of the 65-kDa cleaved form of αCl-2-FLAG from the cell surface (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, endocytosis was decreased by βP616–618A, similar to mutation of βY620 or deletion of the β C terminus. These findings support a critical role for Nedd4-2 in mediating ENaC endocytosis. We cannot exclude a role for the YXXØ motif in regulating ENaC endocytosis in other cells. Nedd4-2 Increases ENaC Endocytosis—As a more direct test of the role of Nedd4-2 in ENaC endocytosis, we transfected cells with Nedd4-2 siRNA. In previous work, we found that Nedd4-2 siRNA specifically silenced Nedd4-2 but not the related E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 (26Snyder P.M. Steines J.C. Olson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5042-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Here we found that Nedd4-2 siRNA (compared with GFP siRNA) decreased the rate of removal of trypsin-activated channels from the cell surface in FRT epithelia, indicating a decrease in the rate of endocytosis (Fig. 5A). Likewise, Nedd4-2 siRNA reduced removal of cleaved αCl-2-FLAG from the cell surface in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 5, B and C). As a second approach, we overexpressed a dominant negative form of Nedd4-2 that contains the four WW domains that bind to ENaC but lacks the HECT domain that catalyzes ENaC ubiquitination (7Knight K.K. Olson D.R. Zhou R. Snyder P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2805-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The dominant negative Nedd4-2 also decreased removal of cleaved channels from the cell surface (Fig. 5, B and C). Together, the data indicate that endogenous Nedd4-2 mediates ENaC endocytosis. In Fig. 6, we tested the effect of Nedd4-2 overexpression on ENaC endocytosis. In HEK 293T cells, overexpression of Nedd4-2 increased endocytosis of cleaved channels (Fig. 6A). In contrast, overexpression did not alter the rate of ENaC endocytosis in FRT epithelia (Fig. 6B). Nedd4-2 Increases Degradation of Cell Surface ENaC—Following endocytosis, ENaC is local"
https://openalex.org/W1997230575,"Recent evidence suggests that in addition to α4β2 and α3-containing nicotinic receptors, α6-containing receptors are present in midbrain dopaminergic neurons and involved in the nicotine reward pathway. Using heterologous expression, we found that α6β2, like α3β2 and α4β2 receptors, formed high affinity epibatidine binding complexes that are pentameric, trafficked to the cell surface, and produced acetylcholine-evoked currents. Chronic nicotine exposure up-regulated α6β2 receptors with differences in up-regulation time course and concentration dependence compared with α4β2 receptors, the predominant high affinity nicotine binding site in brain. The α6β2 receptor up-regulation required higher nicotine concentrations than for α4β2 but lower than for α3β2 receptors. The α6β2 up-regulation occurred 10-fold faster than for α4β2 and slightly faster than for α3β2. Our data suggest that nicotinic receptor up-regulation is subtype-specific such that α6-containing receptors up-regulate in response to transient, high nicotine exposures, whereas sustained, low nicotine exposures up-regulate α4β2 receptors.

Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Muscle nAChRs are pentamers containing four different subunits, α, β, γ (or ϵ), and δ. Neuronal nAChRs are homologous to muscle nAChRs and fall into two different pharmacological classes. One class binds α-bungarotoxin with high affinity and is predominantly pentamers composed of only α7 subunits (4Chen D. Patrick J.W. J. Biol.

Ther. 1999; 289: 1545-1552PubMed Google Scholar). This process, termed nicotine-induced up-regulation, is linked to nicotine addiction. The sites up-regulated appear to be predominantly α4β2 receptors (13Flores C.M. Rogers S.W. Pabreza L.A. Wolfe B.B. Kellar K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar). Yet other nAChR subtypes that display high affinity binding in the presence of cytisine (10Marks M.J. Smith K.W. Collins A.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Rasmussen B.A. Perry D.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 307: 1090-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Whether these nAChRs are α3-, α6-, or even α4-containing receptors is unknown (16Champtiaux N. Gotti C. Cordero-Erausquin M. David D.J. Przybylski C. Lena C. Clementi F. Moretti M. Rossi F.M.

Marks M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2522-2529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that these additional nAChRs are α6-containing receptors. The identification of different neuronal nAChR subtypes has been hampered by a lack of subtype-specific ligands and antibodies, receptor heterogeneity, and low levels of expression (2Wonnacott S. Sidhpura N. Balfour D.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Because of these problems heterologous expression of nAChR subunits has been used to help identify nAChR subtypes and to study up-regulation (22Buisson B. Bertrand D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Several features of the up-regulation allow it to be studied in heterologous systems. First, the mechanisms underlying up-regulation are predominantly, if not exclusively, posttranslational (62Marks M.J. Pauly J.R. Gross S.D. Deneris E.S. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Heinemann S.F. Collins A.C. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2765-2784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar) and, thus, independent of elements regulating nAChR transcription and translation. Second, the features of the up-regulation appear to be independent of the cells in which the nAChRs are expressed, and up-regulation is “cell autonomous” (65Nashmi R. Lester H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 74: 1145-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Studies of α6 subunits have been difficult because α6 subunits appear to aggregate instead of forming functional pentameric receptors (23Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Choi C. Lindstrom J. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2570-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Evans N.M. Bose S. Benedetti G. Zwart R. Pearson K.H. McPhie G.I. Craig P.J. Benton J.P. Volsen S.G. Sher E.

Benavides J. Lukas R.J. Bencherif M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this work we report the successful expression of functional α6β2 receptors in heterologous cells and compare the nicotine-induced up-regulation of α6β2 receptors to that of α3β2 and α4β2 receptors. We find that the time course and concentration dependence of α6β2 and α3β2 receptor up-regulation is similar but ∼10-fold faster than α4β2 receptor up-regulation, requires much higher nicotine concentrations to up-regulate, and occurs without the 2–3-h delay observed with α4β2 receptor up-regulation. These differences suggest that up-regulation of these nicotinic receptor subtypes could occur during different phases of nicotine intake that are observed during smoking. Our findings suggest that the transient, high nicotine levels in brain achieved during a single cigarette are capable of up-regulating α6-containing receptors but not α4β2 receptors. In contrast, our findings suggest that α4β2 receptors, but not α6-containing receptors, up-regulated by the nicotine levels that slowly rise and are sustained during and after many hours of smoking. cDNA Constructs, Cell Culture, and Gene Transfer—Rat α3, α6, and β2 subunit cDNAs (a gift from Dr. J. Boulter, University of California, Los Angeles, CA) were subcloned into pCB7, which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter and the hygromycin resistance gene used to select for cells stably expressing α3β2 hemagglutinin (HA) or α6(FLAG)β2(HA) receptors. The HA epitope (27Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), YPYDVPDYA, and a stop codon were inserted after the last codon of the 3′-translated region of the subunit DNA of the β2 using the extension overlap method (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) as described in Vallejo et al. (29Vallejo Y.F. Buisson B. Bertrand D. Green W.N. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5563-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The FLAG epitope, DYKDDDDK (30Chubet R.G. Brizzard B.L. Biotechniques. 1996; 20: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and a stop codon were inserted after the last codon of the 3′-translated region of the α3 and α6 subunit DNA using the extension overlap method. The α6FLAG construct was then subcloned into the pCDNA3.1 vector. The human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line tsA201 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10,000 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 10% calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Unless otherwise noted, cells were moved to 30 °C 24 h before experimentation. DNA was expressed by transient transfection into tsA201 cells using the calcium phosphate method (31Eertmoed A.L. Vallejo Y.F. Green W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 564-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were established from tsA201 cells using calcium phosphate transfection and hygromycin B selection (Calbiochem) at 0.42 mg/ml. Nicotine-induced Up-regulation and 125I-labeled Epibatidine Binding—Unless otherwise noted 300 or 30 μm nicotine were used for the α3β2 and α6β2 receptors for 24 h at either at 30 or 37 °C. Transiently transfected tsA201 cells were treated 24 h after transfection, and stably expressing cells were used once confluent. In general, cells were washed 4–5 times and collected by gentle agitation with PBS followed by incubation in 2 nm 125I-labeled epibatidine in 500 μl of PBS for 20 min at room temperature. All binding was terminated by vacuum filtration through Whatman (Clifton, NJ) GF/B filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine using a Brandel (Gaithersburg, MD) 24 channel cell harvester. Bound 125I-labeled epibatidine (2200 Ci/mmol) was determined by γ counting (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with nonspecific binding estimated by 125I-labeled epibatidine binding to untransfected tsA201 cells. There was no significant binding to the parent HEK cell line in the absence and presence of nicotine treatment. This background is subtracted from total binding. Sample sizes are ⅓ of a 6-cm plate that contains on average a total of 1–2 mg of protein for the entire plate. Western Blots—Cultures of transiently or stably transfected tsA201 cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS, scraped, pelleted at 5000 × g for 3 min, and resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.02%NaN3, plus 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone at 10 μg/ml). In each case parallel samples were used to estimate protein content using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). No difference in total protein concentration was detected between the 30 and 37 °C conditions. Lysates were incubated with Y-11 anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Anti-HA antibody-antigen complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Purified subunits were analyzed along with ⅙ of a sample of whole cell lysates on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel that was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with Y-11 or M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Secondary antibodies conjugated to a cy5 fluorophore were detected using the Bio-Rad PharosFX Molecular Imager system. This method allowed for more sensitive detection of protein, which could be quantified using the Quantity One program. Bands were quantified after background subtraction, and saturated samples were rescanned at a lower intensity to ensure quantitative analysis. Methanethiosulfonate Ethylammonium Biotinylation Assays—To biotinylate surface receptors, intact, confluent cultures of transiently or stably transfected tsA201 cells were treated with 100 μm methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA)-biotin (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada) for 30 min at room temperature. To biotinylate surface plus intracellular receptors, cells were incubated in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 0.5% saponin, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm EDTA for 5 min, washed twice with PBS, and treated with MTSEA-biotin as before. After MTSEA-biotin treatment, cells were washed with PBS and solubilized at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Lysates with 75 μl of streptavidin immobilized on beaded agarose were rotated overnight at 4 °C. Afterward, biotinylated subunits were subjected to 125I-labeled epibatidine binding or analyzed on an SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with either Y-11 anti-HA or M2 anti-FLAG antibodies. Sucrose Gradient—B23ϵ cells stably expressing AChRs (32Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) were bound with 2 nm 125I-labeled bungarotoxin for 1 h at room temperature. B23ϵ cells and stable α6β2 cells were washed 3 times with PBS, harvested, and lysed in lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100. Triton X-100-soluble fractions were layered on a 5–20% sucrose gradient prepared in lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100. Gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 14.25 h in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. A total of 18 fractions of 300 μl each were collected. Fractions of B23ϵ were counted in the γ-counter to determine the amount of 125I-labeled bungarotoxin bound to each fraction. α6β2 fractions were bound with 2 nm 125I-labeled epibatidine for 20 min at room temperature, and binding was halted by vacuum filtration through Whatman filters using a Brandel 24 channel cell harvester. Bound 125I-labeled epibatidine was determined by γ counting. Electrophysiology—tSA201 cells stably expressing α6β2 were recorded from 35-mm cultures 2–3 days after plating as described previously (22Buisson B. Bertrand D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cells were impaled and maintained in voltage clamp in the whole-cell configuration technique using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz by a PCI card (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Values were stored on the hard disk of a Macintosh computer (Apple Computers, Cupertino, CA) and analyzed using MacDatac (personal program). All recordings were done at room temperature in the following extracellular medium: 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Patch electrodes made of borosilicate electrodes (3–8 megaohms) were filled with the following: 130 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, with KOH. Blue Native Gels—Samples were prepared from tsA201 cells stably expressing α6β2 receptors following basic protocols (33Schagger H. Cramer W.A. Jagow von G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) with modifications. Cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, resuspended in cold hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of chymotrypsin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone and Dounce-homogenized (20 strokes) in a 2-ml glass homogenizer. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. Samples were transferred to Beckman centrifuge tubes (13 × 51 mm Ultra-clear tubes, Palo Alto, CA), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to isolate membranes. Pellets could be stored at –80 °C at this point or resuspended in 100 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0. Dodecylmaltoside (10% stock) was added to the sample for a final concentration of 1%. Blue native sample buffer consisted of 500 mm aminocaproic acid, 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, and 5% (w/v) Coomassie Blue G was added at a 10:1 ratio (sample to blue native sample buffer). 50-μg samples were loaded into wells of a 4% stack (400 μl of 48% acrylamide, 1.75% bisacrylamide, 1.67 ml of 50 mm Bis-Tris, 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0, 2.93 ml of water, 2.5 μl of TEMED, and 28 μl of 10% ammonium persulfate for a 5 ml stack) which overlaid the 4–16% gradient gel. The blue native-PAGE 4–16% gradient gels (48% acrylamide, 1.75% bisacrylamide in 50 mm Bis-Tris, 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0) were poured with a gradient maker. Blue native gel was run at 4 °C at a constant voltage of 75 V until the samples entered the resolving gel and then at 200 V until the end of the run. The top reservoir buffer for this separation of protein complexes was 50 mm Tricine, 15 mm Bis-Tris, 0.02% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250, pH 7.5. The bottom reservoir buffer was 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0. When the tracking dye reached the second third of the gel height, electrophoresis was stopped, and the reservoir buffer was replaced by colorless cathode buffer. Electrophoresis was stopped when the tracking line of CBB G-250 dye had left the edge. The gels were soaked in transfer buffer containing 0.05% SDS for 30 min and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at a constant current of 250 mA overnight. An immunoblot was performed according to standard protocols. Immunofluorescence Staining—Stable cells expressing α6FLβ2HA grown on collagen (BD Biosciences)-coated coverslips were stained in one of several ways. (i) For live staining, intact cells were incubated with rabbit anti-HA antibody (1:1000, Covance Research products, Berkley, CA) diluted in media without serum for 1 h at 25 °C. Cells were then washed 2 times with media lacking serum, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and quenched with 50 mm glycine in PBS for 10 min. Cells were subsequently washed 3 times with PBS and stained with secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (1:1000, Invitrogen), for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. (ii) Alternatively for anti-FLAG staining, cells were fixed before primary and secondary antibody labeling. All the intermediate washes and antibody dilutions were done with PBS containing 5% serum and 2% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stained with mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:500, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes, cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse conjugated to TRITC for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. (iii) To label the intracellular pool of receptor subunits, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 post-fixation for 10 min. Primary and secondary antibody incubations and washes were done as mentioned above. Before mounting, the cells were washed 3 times in PBS. Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used for mounting the coverslips on glass slides. Slides were examined on either an Olympus DSU spinning disk confocal or an Olympus fluoview scanning laser confocal microscope. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—α6FLβ2HA stable cells were grown on 6-cm plates. Live cell staining was performed with rabbit anti-HA antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at 25 °C in medium without serum. After two washes each with 3 ml of media, cells were incubated with secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit cyanine5 (cy5) (1:1000) for 1 h in the dark at 250 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS and allowed to gently lift off the plate with PBS, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA for 10 min. The suspended cells were collected in tubes. Cell analyses were performed on a DakoCytomation CyanADP equipped with 405, 488, and 635 nm lasers emission filters. Background subtraction was done using stable cells stained with secondary antibody alone or with parent TSA201 cell lines stained with both primary and secondary antibodies. All analyses and sorts were repeated three times. The percentage of cells stained for the fluorophor was calculated from 50,000 cells. The data were analyzed using FlowJo. Expression of Subunits into Assembled Receptors—To characterize α3β2 and α6β2 receptors, we fused a FLAG epitope tag to the C termini of the α3 and α6 subunits. We had previously shown that the β2 subunit with a HA tag inserted at the C terminus can be used in studies of α4β2 receptors and have demonstrated that the addition of this short tagging sequence does not significantly alter the receptor properties (29Vallejo Y.F. Buisson B. Bertrand D. Green W.N. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5563-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Consequently, we used these epitope-tagged subunits to identify cells expressing the corresponding transcript. Cell lines that stably express α3β2HA and α6FLAGβ2HA were established, and transient transfection of α3FLAGβ2HA receptors was used in experiments to express FLAG-tagged α3 subunits. Both transfection methods produced comparable amounts of ligand binding sites and levels of nicotine-induced up-regulation (data not shown). We first assayed expression of α6β2 or α3β2 receptors by binding the agonist, 125I-labeled epibatidine (Fig. 1, A and B), to stably transfected α6FLAGβ2HA cells and transiently transfected α3FLAGβ2HA cells. When cells were incubated at 37 °C, α3β2 and α6β2 subtypes showed little epibatidine binding. This is different from 125I-labeled epibatidine binding to α4β2 receptors as reported in Vallejo et al. (29Vallejo Y.F. Buisson B. Bertrand D. Green W.N. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5563-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). At 37 °C, ⅓ of a 6-cm culture of HEK cells stably expressing α4β2 receptors typically bound 0.67 pmol of 125I-labeled epibatidine, whereas the same size culture of α6β2- and α3β2-expressing cells bound 0.031 ± 0.009 and 0.005 ± 0.002 pmol, respectively (Fig, 1, A and B). These comparisons of the two cell lines were performed with approximately equal numbers of cells and total protein, on average 1.5 mg of protein per 6-cm plate for confluent cultures, as well as similar amounts of total β2 subunit expression in the cell lines as assayed by Western blots (data not shown). Thus, the large differences in 125I-labeled epibatidine binding to α6β2, α3β2, and α4β2 receptors in the cell lines does not appear to be caused by differences in cell number or subunit synthesis. Much higher levels of 125I-labeled epibatidine binding to cells expressing α6β2 or α3β2 receptors were observed when the cells were cultured at 30 °C instead of 37 °C for 24 h (Fig. 1, A and B) as previously noted for heterologously expressed α3β2 receptors (34Wang F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28721-28732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and α6β2 receptors (35Tumkosit P. Kuryatov A. Luo J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1358-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The shift in temperature from 37 to 30 °C did not alter cell numbers or total protein concentration in any of the cell lines used in this study. The total protein per 6-cm plate for the samples in Fig. 1 was 1.82 ± 0.28 at 37 °C and 1.84 ± 0.25 at 30 °C. When the stably transfected α6FLAGβ2HA cells and transiently transfected α3FLAGβ2HA cells were cultured at 30 °C, 125I-labeled epibatidine binding was increased 6.5-fold for α6β2 receptors (0.2 ± 0.02pmol) and 12.4-fold for α3β2 receptors (0.066 ± 0.01pmol) compared with cultures maintained at 37 °C (Fig. 1, A and B). We performed additional experiments to test how the temperature change from 37 to 30 °C affected receptor assembly. Co-immunoprecipitation of the subunits was used to assay subunit assembly. We immunoprecipitated α6FLAG or α3FLAG subunits with anti-FLAG antibodies to determine β2 subunit co-immunoprecipitation and β2HA subunits with anti-HA antibodies for the α6 or α3 subunit co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, C and D). Significant numbers of the α6 and α3 subunits co-precipitated with β2 subunits and visa versa, indicating that α6 and β2 subunits assemble into complexes like α3 and β2 subunits. Using fluorescent secondary antibodies, we were able to quantify the estimated levels of co-precipitated subunits and levels of the subunits available in whole cell lysates and found that 40–60% of the total subunit pool was assembled into receptors from the 5–7 experiments performed under each condition in Figs. 1, C and D. From the same quantification, we determined how the difference in culture temperature, 37 versus 30 °C, affected levels of the assembled subunits. As displayed in Figs. 1, A, C, and E, we observed similar effects of temperature on subunit protein and 125I-labeled epibatidine binding for α6β2 receptors. For α3β2 receptors, the change in subunit protein (Figs. 1, D and F) was somewhat less than the change in 125I-labeled epibatidine binding with the temperature shift (Fig. 1B). Assembly into α6β2 Pentamers—Several studies have suggested that expression of α6 and β2 without other nicotinic receptor subunits results in aggregation and no assembly into α6β2 pentamers (23Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Choi C. Lindstrom J. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2570-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To determine whether this phenomenon occurred in our expression system at 30 °C, we performed sucrose gradient sedimentation similar to the experiments of Kuryatov et al. (23Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Choi C. Lindstrom J. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2570-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In parallel, sucrose gradient sedimentation was performed using another cell line stably expressing muscle αβϵδ receptors (32Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Solubilized α6β2 receptors from the stable tsA201 cell line were size-fractioned on a sucrose gradient, and 125I-labeled epibatidine binding was performed. These experiments confirmed previous observations made by Kuryatov et al. (23Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Choi C. Lindstrom J. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2570-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The epibatidine binding sites progressively increased starting at fraction 7 until the bottom of the gradient at fraction 1 (Fig. 2A), with a small peak at fraction 6. This is in contrast to the sedimentation of the muscle αβϵδ receptors (Fig. 2B), which migrated predominantly in a single peak centered at fraction 5 (9–10 Svedberg units). This could result from aggregation of α6 and β2 subunits that fail to assemble into pentamers. Another interpretation is that aggregation occurs after solubilization of the cells, a mechanism that would be similar to that observed for the α7 subunits. Aggregates of α7 subunits formed because the highly reductive co"

We report slow electron velocity-map imaging (SEVI) spectra of ClH 2 – and ClD 2 – . These spectra probe the reactant valley of the neutral reaction potential energy surface, where nonadiabatic transitions responsible for reactivity of the Cl excited spin-orbit state with H 2 would occur. The SEVI spectra reveal progressions in low-frequency Cl·H 2 bending and stretching modes, and are compared to simulations with and without nonadiabatic couplings between the Cl spin-orbit states. Although nonadiabatic effects are small, their inclusion improves agreement with experiment. This comparison validates the theoretical treatment, especially of the nonadiabatic effects, in this critical region of the Cl + H 2 reaction, and suggests strongly that these effects are minor."

Misfolded proteins and orphan subunits of oligomeric proteins may account for up to 30% of newly synthesized proteins (1Schubert U. Anton L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Such aberrant proteins are deleterious to the cell and therefore must be eliminated (2Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol.

The cytosolic p97/Cdc48 ATPase complex appears to provide the driving force for the dislocation of ERAD substrates. This homo-hexameric AAA-ATPase along with its cofactors Ufd1 and Npl4 was shown to be essential for ERAD (7Bays N.W. Wilhovsky S.K. Goradia A. Hodgkiss-Harlow K. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Biol.

Involvement of the p97/Cdc48 complex in the dislocation step was demonstrated by the inhibiting effect of p97 dominant negative variant on dislocation of MHC class I heavy chain in semiintact mammalian cells (8Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) and by the hampered release of CPY* to the cytosol in the ufd1-1 mutant (10Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In the cdc48-10 mutant, CPY* remained trapped within the ER lumen as non-ubiquitinated protein, pointing to Cdc48 as the driving force for passage across ER membranes (12Elkabetz Y. Shapira I. Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3980-3989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The ability of p97/Cdc48 to pull ERAD substrates out of the ER is probably a consequence of conformational changes of p97 during its ATPase cycle, which translate ATP hydrolysis into mechanical forces (13Rouiller I. DeLaBarre B. May A.P. Weis W.I. Brunger A.T. Milligan R.A. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and the underlying activity of AAA-ATPases in unfolding and disassembling proteins (14Lupas A.N. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). An alternative candidate to provide the driving force for dislocation of ERAD substrates is the proteasome. Being a limiting factor in the entire ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway, proteasomes greatly influence system capacity and the substrates degradation rate, including ERAD (15Bajorek M. Finley D. Glickman M.H. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1140-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Rabinovich E. Bajorek M. Glickman M. Bar-Nun S. Israel J. Chem. 2006; 46: 219-224Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Yet, in addition to its established function in proteolysis at the end step of the pathway, the 26S proteasome may also participate in earlier steps, such as dislocation of ERAD substrates. Mechanistically, proteasome association with ER membranes would facilitate its function in pulling substrates out of the ER. Indeed, a proteasome subpopulation is associated with the ER (for reviews see Refs. 17Rivett A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18Hirsch C. Ploegh H.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 268-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The two subcomplexes of the 26S proteasome, the 20S catalytic particle (CP) and the ATPase-containing 19S regulatory particle (RP), were implicated in dislocation. The proteolytic activity of β-subunits within the 20S CP was shown to be required for the extraction of several ERAD substrates from the ER (10Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 19Mayer T.U. Braun T. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3251-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the proteolytic activity of the proteasome does not constitute a general pulling mechanism, as exemplified by ERAD of luminal μs, the heavy chain of secretory IgM, in B lymphocytes (12Elkabetz Y. Shapira I. Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3980-3989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Elkabetz Y. Kerem A. Tencer L. Winitz D. Kopito R.R. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18922-18929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although μs interacted exclusively with ER-bound proteasomes, blockers of proteasomal proteolytic activity had no effect on passage of μs across ER membranes, yet they inhibited subsequent μs release from the ER cytosolic face (12Elkabetz Y. Shapira I. Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3980-3989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The 19S RP was also implicated in dislocation and was proposed as the sole driving force for dislocation of pro-alpha factor in vitro (21Lee R.J. Liu C.W. Harty C. McCracken A.A. Latterich M. Romisch K. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Brodsky J.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The 19S RP is composed of a base subassembly that contains six AAA-ATPase subunits (Rpt1-6) alongside three non-ATPase subunits (Rpn1, Rpn2, Rpn10) and a lid sub-particle that encompasses eight stoichiometric subunits (Rpn3, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn8, Rpn9, Rpn11, and Rpn12) (22DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P. Proske R.J. Chuping M. Afendis S.J. Swaffield J.C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20878-20884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Glickman M.H.

Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biology. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) is crucial for their ability to unfold protein substrates and translocate them through the gated channel into the 20S CP proteolytic chamber. Binding of the 19S RP to the surface of the 20S CP opens the narrow entrance gated by the N-terminal tails of the α-subunits and allows access of protein substrates into the proteolytic chamber for proteolysis (26Groll M.

Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In addition, the Rpt subunits may be involved in binding or anchoring polyubiquitinated substrates since at least one of them, Rpt5/S6, interacts with polyubiquitin chains (29Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Whether each Rpt AAA-ATPase contributes to ERAD differentially is not clear, and the possibility that distinct sets of Rpt subunits participate preferentially in ERAD or cytosolic/nuclear degradation has been partially explored. Studies with yeast mutants such as cim5-1(rpt1), rpt1S, rpt2RF, rpt4R, rpt5S and cim3-1(rpt6) demonstrated involvement of Rpt subunits in ERAD (6Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Subunit Cim5/Rpt1 was involved in extracting membrane ERAD substrates (19Mayer T.U. Braun T. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3251-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and subunits Rpt4 and Rpt5, but not Rpt2, were also implicated in ERAD (10Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The luminal ERAD substrate CPY* was stabilized in the ATPase mutants rpt4R and rpt5S but hardly in rpt2RF (10Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, a small but significant proportion of CPY* remained protease-sensitive in rpt4R, suggesting that protein dislocation could occur independently of Rpt4 ATPase (10Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Hence, it was concluded that p97/Cdc48/Ufd1/Npl4 complex rather than the Rpt subunits provided the driving force for extracting ERAD substrates from the ER (10Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Intrigued by the possibility that distinct sets of proteasomal AAA-ATPases might be engaged in unique processes along the ERAD pathway, we systematically studied individual contributions of the ATPase activity of each of the six 19S AAA-ATPases to proteasomal degradation globally and to ERAD and dislocation of ERAD substrates in particular. To that end, we utilized a set of six mutant strains in which each RPT gene was replaced by an equivalent mutant version with conservative substitutions of the invariant lysine of the Walker A ATP-binding motif (31Rubin D.M. Glickman M.H. Larsen C.N. Dhruvakumar S. Finley D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4909-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This substitution generally results in complete or partial inhibition of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis (32Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This set of strains allows us to elucidate roles of individual Rpt subunits in the various ERAD steps and to study their interrelation with another AAA-ATPase implicated in ERAD, p97/Cdc48, in fulfilling their multiple functions in ERAD. We found that out of the six equivalent mutated Rpt subunits, only rpt2RF and rpt4R displayed impaired ERAD. However, while the Rpt2 mutation disrupted general proteasomal degradation, the Rpt4 mutation was manifested in impaired dislocation of ERAD substrates, an outcome that was partially restored by excess Cdc48. 5Some preliminary results relating to this article were presented in a Symposium on Ubiquitin in Biology and Medicine, in honor of Nobel Laureates Avram Hersko and Aaron Ciechanover, Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, October 31, 2005.

Proteasomal Rpt Subunits Are Not Identical and Indeed Equivalent Mutations Are Distinctively Manifested in Turnover of Luminal and Membrane ERAD Substrates—The obligatory ATP-requiring steps in proteasomal degradation are assumed to include substrate unfolding by the 19S and translocation into the 20S (25Braun B.C.

However, the six Rpt AAA-ATPases at the base of the 19S are functionally non-equivalent, as shown by a comparative study of equivalent conservative mutations in the invariant lysine in the Walker A motif of each of the six RPT genes. These strains exhibit diverse phenotypes vis-à-vis growth sensitivity to temperature and amino acid analogs, protein degradation in vivo and proteolytic activities of purified proteasomes in vitro (31Rubin D.M. Glickman M.H. Larsen C.N. Dhruvakumar S. Finley D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4909-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To assess whether their non-equivalence could be extended to ERAD, possibly uncovering unique roles for proteasomal ATPases in this pathway, we tested the degradation of ERAD substrates in wild-type, in rpt2RF, rpt3R, rpt4R, rpt5R, rpt6R (harboring a conservative lysine-to-arginine substitution) and in rpt1S (harboring a non-conservative substitution) (31Rubin D.M. Glickman M.H. Larsen C.N. Dhruvakumar S. Finley D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4909-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Using the above mutants, we assessed the contribution of each Rpt subunit to ERAD of two well-established topologically distinct ERAD substrates. Luminal CPY*-HA is an HA-tagged version of the unstable point mutant (G255R) of the soluble vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y (6Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), while membrane 6myc-Hmg2 is an unstable Myc-tagged version of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (44Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, we estimated the half-life of CPY*-HA in each rpt mutant by employing the cycloheximide chase assay. In the wild-type (SUB62), t½ was under 1 h. Similar degradation rates were measured in rpt1, rpt3, and rpt5 mutants (t½ ∼ 55 min), and only a slightly reduced turnover rate was observed in rpt6 mutant (t½ ∼ 80 min). However, degradation of CPY*-HA was markedly impaired in rpt2RF and rpt4R strains with extended t½ values approaching 6 h (Fig. 1A). This result clearly points to non-equivalence of Rpt subunits also in ERAD. We next determined whether the impaired degradation of CPY*-HA in rpt2RF and rpt4R reflected a general ERAD phenomenon, or was specific to this substrate. For this purpose, we followed ERAD of membrane 6myc-Hmg2. Once again, 6myc-Hmg2 was rapidly degraded in wild-type (t½ ∼ 1.8 h), yet markedly stabilized in rpt2RF and to an even greater extent in rpt4R, with extended t½ values approaching 5 h and 20 h, respectively (Fig. 1B). The other rpt mutations affected 6myc-Hmg2 degradation only slightly, with t½ values ranging from 1.5 to 2.2 h (Fig. 1B). Hence the degradation patterns of membrane 6myc-Hmg2 or luminal CPY*-HA resemble each other, indicating that only Rpt2 and Rpt4 mutants are manifested in impaired ERAD. Turnover of a Cytosolic Substrate Distinguishes Rpt2, a Participant of General Proteasomal Degradation, from Rpt4, Which Contributes Preferentially to ERAD—The stabilization of ERAD substrates in rpt2RF concurs with the central role of Rpt2 in mediating channel opening into the gated proteolytic chamber (28Kohler A. Cascio P. Leggett D.S. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and as such in promoting degradation of multiple substrates tested so far (31Rubin D.M. Glickman M.H.

A. 2000; 97: 10077-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The stabilization of ERAD substrates in rpt4R may also reflect a general role in proteasomal degradation. Alternatively, Rpt4 may contribute preferentially to ERAD, as implied by the pronounced stabilization of both ERAD substrates we tested. To differentiate between these options, degradation of a cytosolic substrate of the proteasome was monitored. As the closest relative of the luminal ERAD substrate CPY*-HA, we selected ΔssCPY*-GFP (34Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), as both substrates encompass an identical CPY* domain (the HA and GFP tags exerted no effect on degradation). Lacking a signal sequence, ΔssCPY*-GFP remained in the cytosol and, as expected, it was stabilized in the proteasomal β-subunit temperature sensitive mutant pre1-1 at 37 °C (Fig. 2A), confirming its proteasomal degradation. Clearly, in the rpt2RF mutant ΔssCPY*-GFP was stabilized and the 30-50-min half-life of this cytosolic substrate was extended to values approaching 4 h (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, degradation of cytosolic ΔssCPY*-GFP proceeded unabated"

FimH is able to interact with mannosylated surface via a shear-enhanced catch bond mechanism. We show that the FimH lectin domain possesses a ligand-induced binding site (LIBS), a type of allosterically regulated epitopes characterized in integrins. Analogous to integrins, in FimH the LIBS epitope becomes exposed in the presence of the ligand (or “activating” mutations) and is located far from the ligand-binding site, close to the interdomain interface. Also, the antibody binding to the LIBS shifts adhesin from the low to high affinity state. Binding of streptavidin to the biotinylated residue within the LIBS also locks FimH in the high affinity state, suggesting that the allosteric perturbations in FimH are sustained by the interdomain wedging. In the presence of antibodies, the strength of bacterial adhesion to mannose is increased similar to the increase observed under shear force, suggesting the same allosteric mechanism, a shift in the interdomain configuration. Thus, an integrin-like allosteric link between the binding pocket and the interdomain conformation can serve as the basis for the catch bond property of FimH and, possibly, other adhesive proteins.

A wide variety of proteins has shown an allosteric shift in their affinity for ligands or enzymatic substrates. In the cell adhesion receptor protein family of integrins, such a shift has been linked to the quaternary configuration between binding and nonbinding domains, where an increased affinity toward fibrinogen and other ligands (the integrin activation) involves a switchblade-like shift from the bend to the straightened conformation of the integrin domains (1Xiao T.

FimH has two domains, the mannose-binding lectin domain (Ld, 1-156 amino acids) and the fimbria-incorporating pilin domain (160-273 amino acids), that are connected via a 3-amino acid-long linker chain (30Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S. Pinkner J. Hultgren S.J. Knight S.D. Science. 1999; 285: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The mannose-binding site is located on the top of the Ld (characterized as being in a β-barrel shape), at the opposite end from the interdomain linker (31Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that shear stress enhances FimH-mediated binding of E. coli to eukaryotic cells (18Thomas W.E. Trintchina E. Forero M. Vogel V. Sokurenko E.V. Cell. 2002; 109: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) or mannose-coated surfaces (16Thomas W.E. Forero M. Yakovenko O. Nilsson L. Vicini P. Sokurenko E.V.

Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Enhanced binding to mannosylated surfaces under increased flow conditions involves both a higher number of bound bacteria and a switch from a weak, rolling adhesion mode to strong, stationary binding (17Thomas W.E. Nilsson L. Forero M. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The force-enhanced nature of the FimH-mannose interaction has also been shown recently by using atomic force microscopy. 5O. Yakovenko, S. Sharma, M. Forero, V. Tchesnokova, P. Aprikian, B. Kidd, A. Mach, V. Vogel, E. Sokurenko, and W. E. Thomas, submitted for publication. Based on steered molecular dynamics simulations and site-directed mutagenesis studies, we have proposed that enhancement of FimH binding to a mannosylated surface might be associated with extension of the interdomain linker chain by shear-generated tensile force (18Thomas W.E. Trintchina E. Forero M. Vogel V. Sokurenko E.V. Cell. 2002; 109: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). We recently showed that interaction between Ld and pilin domain regulates the affinity to mannose, with amino acid mutations that disrupt the interaction resulting in a shift of Ld from a low affinity conformational state toward mannose to high affinity state (28Aprikian P. Tchesnokova V. Kidd B. Yakovenko O. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Trinchina E. Vogel V. Thomas W. Sokurenko E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23437-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). We also proposed that the shift toward increased binding strength between FimH and its mannose ligand under tensile force is allosteric in nature (17Thomas W.E. Nilsson L. Forero M. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 28Aprikian P. Tchesnokova V. Kidd B. Yakovenko O. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Trinchina E. Vogel V. Thomas W. Sokurenko E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23437-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and a mathematical model for such a mechanism has been advanced (16Thomas W.E. Forero M. Yakovenko O. Nilsson L. Vicini P. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 753-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, it has not been demonstrated directly that the FimH protein is capable of shifting in an allosteric fashion between low and high affinity conformations. Here we show that the interaction of soluble or surface-immobilized mannose with FimH under equilibrium (no force) conditions results in exposure of an LIBS epitope region in Ld that is located away from the mannose-binding pocket, close to or in the interface between the Ld and pilin domain. Binding of monoclonal antibodies to this LIBS leads to a dramatic increase in the FimH affinity for mannose, similar to the increased adhesion observed under shear stress. Furthermore, the LIBS is constitutively exposed in FimH mutant variants with a disrupted interdomain interaction or in FimH with molecular chaperone wedged between the domains. Thus, there is an allosteric link between the high affinity state of ligand-binding pocket and the open conformation of interdomain interface that is analogous to one demonstrated in integrins. Because tensile force would favor the open interdomain configuration, this type of allostery provides a mechanism for the shear force-enhanced behavior of the FimH adhesin and, likely, other receptor proteins shown or proposed to form catch bonds. Reagents—Monomannosylated BSA (Man1-BSA) was obtained from Dextra Laboratories, Ltd. (Reading, UK). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAb) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (PAb) were raised against E. coli K12 FimH-lectin domain (1-160 amino acids) by PickCell Inc. (Netherlands). Strains—Recombinant strains utilized here were constructed using a fim null E. coli K12 derivative, AAEC191A (provided by Dr. Ian Blomfield, University of Kent, UK), and were described previously (50Sokurenko E.V. Schembri M.A. Trintchina E. Kjaergaard K. Hasty D.L. Klemm P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, AAEC191A was transformed with the recombinant plasmid pPKL114 (provided by Dr. Per Klemm, Danish Technical University, Copenhagen, Denmark) to create strain KB18. Plasmid pPKL114 is a pBR322 derivative containing the entire fim gene cluster from the E. coli strain K12, but with a translational stop-linker inserted into the unique KpnI site of the fimH gene. Strain KB18 cells express only a few long, nonadhesive fimbriae. For the studies reported here, strain KB18 was cotransformed with a series of isogenic pGB2-24-based plasmids, containing fimH alleles from various clinical isolates, as well as fimH alleles created by site-directed mutagenesis. The fimH allele encoding the wild-type FimH variant was derived from E. coli strain K12 and is identical to that encoding FimH in E. coli strain J96, which was used to determine the X-crystallographic structure (30Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S. Pinkner J. Hultgren S.J. Knight S.D. Science. 1999; 285: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the fmH gene was performed using a Quick-Change kit from Stratagene. The presence of the mutation was verified by sequencing. Bacterial Binding—Static assays of bacterial adhesion to immobilized Man1 ligands (Man1-BSA or yeast mannan) and Man3 ligand (bovine RNase B) were carried out in 96-well plates as described previously (50Sokurenko E.V. Schembri M.A. Trintchina E. Kjaergaard K. Hasty D.L. Klemm P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, plates were coated with mannosylated substrates in 0.02 m NaHCO3 buffer, blocked by 0.1% BSA in PBS. Then 100 μl of E. coli suspension at A540 2.0 (radiolabeled by growing overnight in the presence of [3H]thymidine) were incubated in the wells for 45 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 50 mm α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside (αMMP). After washing away unbound bacteria, the level of bacterial binding was measured by counting the radioactivity in each well. The actual number of bound bacteria was determined from calibration curves. Each data point was done in quadruplicate and then averaged. Binding under shear stress was performed using parallel plate flow chambers as described previously (18Thomas W.E. Trintchina E. Forero M. Vogel V. Sokurenko E.V. Cell. 2002; 109: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Briefly, 35-mm polystyrene cell culture dishes (Corning, Inc.) were coated with Man1-BSA, and a parallel plate flow chamber (2.5 (long) × 0.25 cm (wide) × 250 μm (high), GlycoTech) was assembled on top of it. The entire assembly was then mounted on a Nikon TE2000-E microscope with a 10× phase-contrast objective, connected to high resolution CCD Cascade camera (Roper Scientific, Inc.). Bacteria in 0.2% BSA/PBS flowed into the chamber at different flow rates using a Warner Instruments syringe pump. Bacterial binding to the surface was recorded and analyzed using MetaMorph® or MetaView® (Universal Imaging Corp., PA) video acquisition software as described in the text. Fimbriae Purification—Fimbriae were purified from recombinant E. coli strains expressing type 1 fimbriae with different FimH. Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB growth media with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 125 rpm, then harvested at 8000 rpm, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl buffer, osterized four times for 1 min with a 1-min pause on ice using PRO 200 homogenizer (PRO Scientific Inc., Oxford, CT). Cell debris was spun down, and fimbriae were precipitated from the supernatant with 0.2 m MgCl2 at least twice. Finally fimbriae were dissolved in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Protein concentration was measured using BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce) after the fimbriae were heated for 5 min at 99 °C in the presence of 0.1 m HCl. ELISA—Monoclonal and polyclonal antibody binding to immobilized fimbriae or lectin domain was carried out in 96-well flat-bottom plates. Both fimbriae and Ld were immobilized in 0.02 m NaHCO3 buffer for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed 4-6 times with PBS. Fimbriae were immobilized at 200 μg/ml, Ld at 0.2 μm, unless otherwise stated. Plates were quenched for at least 15 min with 0.1% BSA/PBS. Different antibodies were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with or without 50 mm αMMP. Bound antibodies were detected in direct ELISA using HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (for PAb) or anti-mouse (for MAb) antibodies. The reaction was developed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase enzyme immunoassay substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Plates were read on Molecular Devices Emax microtiter plate reader and then analyzed. In comparative experiments concentrations of immobilized FimH constructs and fimbriae were adjusted to give similar response at binding of polyclonal Ab in ELISA. Horseradish Peroxidase Binding to Fimbriae—Fimbriae (0.4 mg/ml) were immobilized in 96-well microtiter plates as described above. Where indicated, the immobilized fimbriae were pretreated with 50 mm αMMP and 1:200 diluted MAb separately or together for 1 h at 37 °C, as described under “Results.” After the pretreatment, followed by six washes with PBS, 40 μg/ml HRP in BSA/PBS was added to the wells with or without 50 mm αMMP, or a 1:200 dilution of monoclonal antibodies, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Bound HRP was detected using the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine kit as described above. SPR Experiments—SPR experiments were generally performed as described previously on a Biacore2000™ instrument (Biacore Inc.) (28Aprikian P. Tchesnokova V. Kidd B. Yakovenko O. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Trinchina E. Vogel V. Thomas W. Sokurenko E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23437-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In brief, Man1-BSA was immobilized on a CM5 research grade chip via amino coupling at 4000-8000 response units using an amino-coupling kit (Biacore). A blank surface (activated and blocked with ethanolamine) was used as the reference surface. Purified fimbriae in HBS-EP buffer (Biacore) were injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at a concentration of 2 mg/ml for 2 min (unless otherwise stated). To check for nonspecific binding, BSA was immobilized on the CM5 chip. No binding of fimbriae to BSA was detected. Solution affinity of fimbriae to αMMP was determined as follows. Multiple concentrations of fimbriae were injected over Man1-BSA ligand. The maximum fimbriae concentration (2 mg/ml) was pre-mixed with a range of αMMP concentrations (spanning the KD value) and injected over the course of the same experiment. The average response near the end of injection was determined. The response of serial dilutions of fimbriae was plotted against fimbriae concentration to create a standard curve. The response of fimbriae with αMMP was plotted on the standard curve to determine the amount of unbound (free from αMMP) fimbriae. The amount of “free” fimbriae was plotted against αMMP concentration and fitted to the solution affinity model. The analysis was performed using BIAevaluation software (Biacore). Every fimbriae or αMMP concentration injections were performed in duplicate or triplicate. To estimate the molar concentration of fimbriae, a molecular weight was arbitrarily assumed, based on an average 750 subunits per fimbriae. (We did not attempt a more accurate measurement, because calculation of solution affinity was not affected by this scaling parameter.) The solution affinity (KD) of fimbriae toward the soluble αMMP determined is an average of six independent experiments, performed on three different CM5 chips, using different fimbriae preparations and different αMMP batches. The fast kinetic parameters of the binding of fimbriae (without Fab, see below) to Man1-BSA allowed us to use a 1-min injection time in some of the experiments, thus saving the protein. Next, purified fimbriae were pre-mixed with different molar ratios of purified Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies MAb21 and then injected over the Man1-BSA surface to determine the conditions and Fab concentrations optimal for detection of FimH activation. A 10× molar excess of Fab fragments over fimbriae was chosen, because higher Fab concentrations did not significantly change the response. The solution affinity to αMMP of fimbriae pre-mixed with Fab fragments was measured in the same manner as Fab-free fimbriae. The determined KD value is the average of two independent experiments. Purification of Fimbrial Tips and Adhesin-Chaperone Complex—Fimbrial tips containing FimH adhesin, FimG, and FimF minor subunits and FimC chaperone with C-terminal His6 tag (FimH-G-F-C-His6) and FimH complexed with FimC-His6 (FimH-C-His6) were purified as described previously (28Aprikian P. Tchesnokova V. Kidd B. Yakovenko O. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Trinchina E. Vogel V. Thomas W. Sokurenko E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23437-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, genes encoding FimH and FimC-His6 or FimH, FimG, FimF, and FimC-His6 proteins were cloned into pET22b vector and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. FimH-G-F-C-His6 or FimH-C-His6 protein complexes were purified from periplasmic fraction on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column, followed by purification on mannosylated agarose affinity column and a Superdex 75 size-exclusion chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). Cysteine Labeling with [14C]Iodoacetamide—Purified fimbriae expressing FimH:N29C variant were immobilized in microtiter strip wells as described above, and 10 nm [14C]iodoacetamide (Amersham Biosciences) was added to fimbriae with or without 50 mm αMMP and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then overnight at 4 °C. Strips were broken, and at least triplicates for each data point were checked for cysteine labeling using the scintillation method. Cysteine Labeling with Biotin-maleimide—Purified fimbriae expressing FimH:N29C variant were immobilized as described above. Wells were quenched with 0.1% gelatin in PBS to reduce nonspecific labeling. Biotin-maleimide was added at 2 μg/ml with or without mannose and were allowed to bind for 1 h at 37 °C. To detect fimbriae-bound biotin, wells were incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:10,000 dilution; Endogen Inc., Woburn, MA) with or without mannose for 1 h at 37 °C. To test for activation of biotin-labeled fimbriae with streptavidin, 100 μl of unconjugated streptavidin (1 μg/ml in 0.1% of gelatin in PBS) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the immobilized fimbriae (biotinylated in the presence of αMMP as described above), followed by extensive washes, then incubation with HRP (40 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, and detection with the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine kit. Statistical Analysis of ELISA, HRP Binding, and Cysteine Labeling Experiments—Each experiment was repeated at least twice, with triplicates or quadruplicates for every data point. Results are represented on graphs as the average of replicates in each experiment, with standard deviation used for error bars. Monoclonal Antibodies against Lectin Domain Bind to Fimbria-incorporated FimH Only in the Presence of Mannose—We have raised polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies by immunizing rabbit and mice with the purified Ld. Polyclonal antibodies recognized both Ld and purified fimbriae immobilized on the plastic surface (Fig. 1, PAb). Unlike the polyclonal antibodies, however, a monoclonal antibody clone (MAb21) bound well to the Ld, but only marginally to the purified fimbriae (Fig. 1, MAb21) even after a prolonged (4 h) incubation (not shown). Because immunoglobulins are N-glycosylated, we wanted to exclude the possibility that the observed binding is because of the interaction of the FimH with mannosyl residues of the oligosaccharides. To this end, we repeated the binding in the presence of soluble mannose. Mannose did not affect the binding of polyclonal antibodies to either Ld or fimbriae (Fig. 1, PAb+αMMp) or binding of MAb21 to the Ld (Fig. 1, MAb21+αMMp). Surprisingly, in the presence of soluble mannose, MAb21 recognized the fimbriae significantly better than in the absence of mannose (Fig. 1D). Thus, these findings indicate the existence of an antibody-binding site in the purified Ld that is only observed in fimbria-incorporated FimH and only in the presence of mannose. Consequently, it appears that the fimbrial form of FimH possesses a LIBS epitope, i.e. an epitope exposed upon binding of the ligand (mannose) to the receptor protein (FimH). MAb Binding to the FimH Adhesin Enhances Its Mannose Binding Capability—LIBS-specific antibodies have been described originally for integrins (5Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2088234231,"Stars and gas in galaxies, hot intracluster medium, and intergalactic photo-ionized gas make up at most half of the baryons that are expected to be present in the universe. The majority of baryons are still missing and are expected to be hidden in a web of warm-hot intergalactic medium. This matter was shock-heated during the collapse of density perturbations that led to the formation of the relaxed structures that we see today. Finding the missing baryons and thereby producing a complete inventory of possibly the only detectable component of the energy-mass budget of the universe is crucial to validate or invalidate our standard cosmological model."
https://openalex.org/W1999200626,"Numerous crystalline materials, including those of bioorganic origin, comprise incommensurate sublattices whose mutual arrangement is described in a superspace framework exceeding three dimensions. We report direct observation by neutron diffraction of superspace symmetry breaking in a solid-solid phase transition of an incommensurate host-guest system: the channel inclusion compound of nonadecane/urea. Strikingly, this phase transition generates a unit cell doubling that concerns only the modulation of one substructure by the other-an internal variable available only in superspace. This unanticipated pathway for degrees of freedom to rearrange leads to a second phase transition, which again is controlled by the higher dimensionality of superspace. These results reveal nature's capacity to explore the increased number of phases allowed in aperiodic crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2115010319,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) has an important role in regulating sympathetic neuron survival and target field innervation during development. Here we show that glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor–related protein (GITR), a member of the TNF superfamily, and its ligand (GITRL) are co-expressed in mouse sympathetic neurons when their axons are innervating their targets under the influence of target-derived NGF. In culture, GITRL enhanced NGF-promoted neurite growth from neonatal sympathetic neurons, and preventing GITR-GITRL interaction in these neurons or knocking down GITR inhibited NGF-promoted neurite growth without affecting neuronal survival. Tnfrsf18−/− (Gitr) neonates have reduced sympathetic innervation density in vivo compared with Gitr+/+ littermates. GITR activation is required for the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 by NGF that is necessary for neurite growth. Our results reveal a previously unknown signaling loop in developing sympathetic neurons that is crucial for NGF-dependent axon growth and target innervation."
https://openalex.org/W2132409221,"We have previously reported that central repeated units (CRUs) of Ahnak act as a scaffolding protein networking phospholipase Cγ and protein kinase C (PKC). Here, we demonstrate that an Ahnak derivative consisting of four central repeated units binds and activates PKC-α in a phosphatidylserine/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-independent manner. Moreover, NIH3T3 cells expressing the 4 CRUs of Ahnak showed enhanced c-Raf, MEK, and Erk phosphorylation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) compared with parental cells. To evaluate the effect of loss-of-function of Ahnak in cell signaling, we investigated PKC activation and Raf phosphorylation in embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) of the Ahnak knock-out (Ahnak-/-) mouse. Membrane translocation of PKC-α and phosphorylation of Raf in response to PMA or platelet-derived growth factor were decreased in Ahnak null MEF cells compared with wild type MEFs. Several lines of evidence suggest that PKC-α activity is regulated through association with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). A co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the association of PKC-α with PP2A was disrupted in NIH3T3 cells expressing 4 CRUs of Ahnak in response to PMA. Consistently, Ahnak null MEF cells stimulated by PMA showed enhanced PKC-PP2A complex formation, and add-back expression of Ahnak into Ahnak null MEF cells abolished the PKC-PP2A complex formation in response to PMA.

Ahnak is a large protein with a size of 700 kDa that was initially identified in human neuroblastomas and skin epithelial cells (1Shtivelman E. Cohen F.E. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ahnak can be divided into three regions based on the protein structure; they are the amino-terminal 251 amino acids, the large central region of about 4300 amino acids made up of conserved domains repeated 36 times, and the carboxyl-terminal 1002 amino acids. Several lines of recent evidence indicate that the carboxyl-terminal region of Ahnak plays an important role in the formation of cytoskeletal structure, calcium homeostasis, and muscle regeneration (4Hohaus A.

In low calcium concentrations, Ahnak proteins are mainly localized in nucleus, but an increase in intracellular calcium level leads to translocation of the protein to the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation of serine 5535 in the carboxyl-terminal of Ahnak protein by nuclear protein kinase B was shown to be essential for its export from nucleus (12Sussman J. Stokoe D. Ossina N.

The typical central repeated unit of Ahnak is 128 amino acids in length and contains a hepta-sequence motif, (D/E)ϕΩϕK(A/G)P, where ϕ and Ω represent hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues, respectively. The 128-amino acid-long domain represents structurally a polyionic rod with hydrophobic amino acids facing inward and hydrophilic amino acids facing outward. The overall structure is a typical β-strand that is predicted to form a propeller structure. Therefore, a single Ahnak molecule would contain a large number of tandem propeller structures. It is suggested that the central repeat unit likely supports the structural integrity and scaffolding activity of Ahnak (13Komuro A. Masuda Y. Kobayashi K. Babbitt R. Gunel M. Flavell R.A.

The result demonstrated that central repeated units of Ahnak plays the role of a molecular linker for calcium homeostasis in response to agonists.It is well established that PKC family members play important roles in the regulation of differentiation and proliferation of many cell types in response to diverse stimuli including hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors (16Shirai Y. Saito N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The PKC isozymes can be classified into three groups according to their regulatory properties, which are in turn governed by the presence of specific domains in the proteins. The conventional PKCs (cPKCs) include PKC-α, -βI, -βII and -γ, and these isoforms can be activated by Ca2+ and/or by diacylglycerol and phorbol esters. The novel PKCs (nPKCs) including PKC-δ, -ϵ, -θ, and -η, can also be activated by diacylglycerol and phorbol esters but are Ca2+-independent (16Shirai Y. Saito N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Kikkawa U. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev.

The atypical PKCs, which include PKC-ξ and PKC-ι, are unresponsive to Ca2+ and diacylglycerol/phorbol esters. Consistent with these structural differences, individual PKC isozymes mediate unique cellular functions through the interaction with distinct PKC-binding proteins. PKC-binding proteins including receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK), MARCKS, and PICK1 can influence subcellular localization, mechanism of activation, and specificity of substrate of PKCs (11Larsson C.

PP2A activity is regulated by mechanisms that include subunit phosphorylation, methylation of catalytic subunit, and specific targeting to subcellular localization. Evidences suggest that PP2A interacts with PKC and regulates its activity (22Jiffar T. Kurinna S. Suck G. Carlson-Bremer D. Ricciardi M.R. Konopleva M. Andreeff M. Ruvolo P.P.

In this report, we describe the effect of 4 CRUs of Ahnak on PKC activity through regulation of the interaction of PKC with PP2A. We also demonstrate that 4 CRUs of Ahnak protein play a critical role in the activation of Raf/MEK/Erk/Elk-1 cascade as a downstream effector of PKC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[γ-32P]ATP (10mCi/ml) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences.

Antibodies against phospho-Raf-1 (Ser-338), PKC-α, and PP2A and purified recombinant PKC-α protein were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibodies to PKC-δ and phospho-PKC (Ser-660) and integrin β1 were purchased form BD Transduction Laboratories. Antibody to HA was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and a luciferase assay kit was purchased from Promega, Madison, WI.Cell Cultures—NIH3T3 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Construction of Plasmids—Various kinds of pcDNA3(HA)-Ahnak fragment including N (amino acid residues 1–257), 4 CRUs (amino acid residues 3860–4412), C1 (amino acid residues 4640–5386), and C2 (amino acid residues 5258–5643) domains as previously described (11Larsson C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pGEX4T1. All constructs were checked by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing.Generation and Characterization of Ahnak Knock-out Mice—Genomic DNA was extracted from 129/SvJ mouse J1 embryonic stem cells and was used as template DNA for PCR. A targeting vector was constructed to delete a 502-bp genomic fragment containing a segment of amino-terminal region of ahnak gene using 3′ 5.1-kb long arm fragment and 5′ 1.9-kb short arm fragment ligated into the pPNT vector. To construct 3′ 5.1-kb long arm fragment, a NotI-linked forward primer (5′-gcggccgccagctacatgtggctaccatg-3′) and a XhoI-linked reverse primer (5′-ctcgagtggaactcggatccctccttt-3′) were used. To construct the 5′ short arm, a XbaI-linked forward primer (5′-tctagactctgcatcaggttcaaaggg-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-ccctctatttttggtgcagac-3′) were used.The positive selection gene was the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo) resistant to the neomycin analog, G418. The negative selection gene was the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk), which conferred sensitivity to the guanosine analog, ganciclovir (GANC). The targeting vector was linearized with NotI and electroporated into 129/SvJ mouse J1 embryonic stem cells. Clones resistant to G418 and GANC were selected, and homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern blotting. Among 252 clones screened, 8 clones with successfully modified ahnak gene were verified. To produce chimeric mice, the embryonic stem clones containing the targeted mutation were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and these were subsequently transferred to recipient females on day 3 of pseudo-pregnancy. The resulting male chimeric mice were bred to C57BL/6 females to obtain heterozygous Ahnak mice. Germ-line transmission of the mutant allele was verified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA from F1 offspring with agouti coat color. Interbreeding of the heterozygous mice was performed to generate homozygous Ahnak-deficient mice.For Southern blot analysis, a 460-bp probe located just outside the 5′ short arm of the knock-out vector was prepared using two primers (the forward primer, 5′-gcccaagttcagtatgcctac-3′; the reverse primer, 5′-gagacatcaaggtcagccttg-3′). Mouse genomic DNA was isolated from mouse tail, digested with BamHI, and hybridized with the probe. A 8.6-kb Ahnak wild-type DNA fragment and a 9.9-kb Ahnak mutant DNA fragment were detected.Preparation MEFs—MEFs were prepared from day 13.5 embryos and were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Tissues from embryo were incubated with 3 ml of trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen 25300–096) with gentle shaking at 37 °C for 30 min. Trypsinization was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and fresh medium (DMEM, 10% FBS). Cells from the tissue were allowed to attach the culture dish. MEF cells were cultured at 37 °C in atmosphere of 5% CO2 in DMEM (JBI, Daegu, Korea) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (JBI) and 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimyotic solution (Invitrogen).Transfection—NIH3T3 cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. The cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of pcDNA3-HA and pcDNA3-HA-4 CRUs using Effectin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and maintained in the complete medium for 24 h. The cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then stimulated with 100 μm or 10 ng/ml PMA for the indicated times. MEF cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3-HA and pcDNA3-HA-4 CRUs using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol and maintained in the complete medium for 24 h. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml PMA or PDGF for the indicated times.GST Pulldown Assays—Cultures of Escherichia coli BL21 containing pGEX4T1 or various pGEX4T1-Ahnak derivatives (see above) were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. The harvested bacteria were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (0.1 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently incubated with NIH3T3 cell lysates overexpressing HA-PKC-α. The samples were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and subjected to immunoblotting assay with antibody against HA.Cell Fractionation Experiment—After washing twice with PBS, hypo-osmotic solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) was added to the culture plates. Cells were subsequently scraped off the plates and homogenized on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to prepare the cytosolic fraction. The membrane fraction was collected by solubilizing the remaining pellet in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA) buffer containing protease inhibitors, and RIPA lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of the cytosol or the membrane fractions were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies followed by species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Lysates (1–2 × 106 cells) were mixed with antibodies (0.5–1 μg) for 4 h or overnight and then incubated with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed 5 times with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10% glycerol). After boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence.Immunofluorescence—MEF cells were grown on coverslips. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h, stimulated with 100 ng/ml PDGF for 10 min, washed with cold PBS, fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100. Nonspecific sites were blocked by treating the cells with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 4 °C. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies against PKC-α in PBS for overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS, incubated with the secondary antibody (TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG; KPL) for 40 min at room temperature in the dark, and then mounted on glass slides using a drop of Aqua-Poly/mount. Images were recorded using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss 510).PKC Activity Assay—PKC-α (5 ng) was incubated in 20 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, containing 3 μm magnesium acetate, 750 μm CaCl2, 200 μm ATP (0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), 1 μg of histone I, and purified Ahnak proteins with or without phospholipid micelles (0.8 μg of phosphatidylserine (PS)) and 0.08 μg of DG) at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Products were subjected to 12% SDS/PAGE and autoradiographed by BAS-2500 (Fuji Co.) (25Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).Luciferase Reporter Assays—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with indicated combinations of pFA2-Elk-1, pFR-luciferase reporter, 4 CRUs of Ahnak, and control plasmids (Stratagene Co.). Cells were maintained in the complete medium for 24 h. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml PMA for 7 h in serum-free media and then harvested for measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by measuring β-galactosidase activities (26Yang S.H. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).RESULTSCentral Repeated Units of Ahnak Interact and Activate PKC-α—To identify the domains of Ahnak responsible for interaction with PKC-α, we made four GST-conjugated Ahnak derivatives; GST-N (amino acids 1–257), GST-4 central repeated units (4 CRUs, amino acids 3859–4412), GST-C1 (amino acids 4640–5386), and GST-C2 (amino acids 5258–5643). PKC-α, the major isoform in NIH3T3 cells, interacts strongly with 4 CRUs of Ahnak in vitro (Fig. 1A). A weak interaction was also detected between PKC-α and C1 or C2 regions of Ahnak. The amino-terminal fragment of Ahnak did not bind to PKC-α (Fig. 1A).To investigate whether 4 CRUs of Ahnak associates with PKC-α isozyme in cells, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with plasmids harboring HA-tagged 4 CRUs. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of PMA, and then cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to HA. Immunoblot analysis of the resulting precipitates with antibodies to PKC-α revealed that 4 CRUs of Ahnak interacted with PKC-α (Fig. 1B). Moreover, it was shown that interaction of PKC-α with 4 CRUs of Ahnak was increased by PMA stimulation (Fig. 1B).To explore the direct effect of 4 CRUs of Ahnak on PKC activity in the complex, we performed PKC activity assay using histone I phosphorylation in the presence or absence of purified 4 CRUs of Ahnak. Incubation of purified PKC-α with 4 CRUs of Ahnak showed an increase in the activity of PKC-α in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). PS/DG is a well known PKC activator that imparts its effect through the interaction to C1 domain of PKC. Oversaturation of PKC-α activity by the addition of excess 4 CRUs of Ahnak did not show further activation in the presence of PS/DG, indicating that 4 CRUs of Ahnak bind to C1 domain of PKC-α (Fig. 2B). We next investigated the effect of 4 CRUs of Ahnak on the phosphorylation of PKC-α in cells. Expression of 4 CRUs of Ahnak in NIH3T3 cells resulted in increased PKC-α phosphorylation in response to PMA compared with parental cells (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Enhanced PKC activity by 4 CRUs of Ahnak. A and B, 5 ng PKC-α was incubated (30 min 30 °C) in 20 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, containing 3 mm magnesium acetate, 750 μm CaCl2, 200 μm ATP (0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), 1 μg of histone, and purified proteins Ahnak without or with phospholipids micelles (0.8 μg of PS and 0.08 μg of DG) (B). Reactions were stopped and subjected to SDS/PAGE and autoradiographed by BAS-2500. C, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA or pcDNA3-HA-4 CRUs of Ahnak. After serum starvation for 12 h, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of PMA for 30 min. Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis (WB) with antibodies to phospho-specific PKC-α and HA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)4 CRUs of Ahnak Activate the c-Raf/MEK1/2/Erk Pathway—It has been well established that PKC plays an important role in the regulation of various cellular functions such as cell division, survival, and proliferation through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk/MAPK) cascade. It is also known that PKC-α functions as a potent activator of Raf and thereby functions as that of the Erk pathway as well (27Nakashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether 4 CRUs of Ahnak activate the c-Raf/MEK/Erk signaling cascade in response to PMA. We performed immunoblot assays with antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of c-Raf, MEK, and Erk in NIH3T3 cells expressing 4 CRUs of Ahnak in the absence or presence of PMA. Expression of 4 CRUs of Ahnak in NIH3T3 cells resulted in enhanced c-Raf, MEK1/2, and Erk phosphorylation in a PMA concentration-dependent manner compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment of the cells with GF109203X, a potent PKC inhibitor, completely blocked the effect of 4 CRUs of Ahnak on phosphorylation of Raf in response to PMA (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that 4 CRUs of Ahnak potentiated PKC-dependent phosphorylation of c-Raf and downstream signaling cascade.FIGURE 3Ahnak mediates the activation of c-Raf/MEK/Erk pathway in NIH3T3 cells by PMA. A, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA or pcDNA3-HA-4 CRUs of Ahnak. After serum starvation for 12 h, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of PMA. Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphorylated active forms of c-Raf, MEK1/2, or Erk1/2. The membrane was subsequently re-probed and immunoblotted (WB) with antibodies against actin or HA. B, NIH3T3 cells expressing 4 CRUs of Ahnak were pretreated with GF109203X (5 μm) for 10 min before treatment of PMA (10 ng/ml). Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphorylated active forms of c-Raf and ERK1/2. C, concerted action of 4 CRUs of Ahnak and PMA is specific for Erk phosphorylation but not JNK or p38 MAPK phosphorylation. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA or pcDNA3-HA-4 CRUs of Ahnak. After serum starvation for 12 h, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of PMA for 30 min. Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphorylated active forms of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK. D, 4 CRUs of Ahnak activate Elk1-luc activity in response to PMA. NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with pFA2-Elk-1, pFR-luciferase reporter, and either pcDNA3-HA or pcDNA3-HA-4 CRUs of Ahnak. Cells were maintained in the complete medium for 24 h. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml PMA for 7h in serum-free media. Then, cells were harvested for measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Data are the means ± S.E. of values from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We investigated the effect of 4 CRUs of Ahnak on other MAPK family members. NIH3T3 cells expressing 4 CRUs of Ahnak were incubated in the absence or presence of PMA, and then cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the phosphorylated form of JNK or p38 MAPK. 4 CRUs of Ahnak consistently potentiated Erk phosphorylation in response to PMA but not JNK or p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that Ahnak-dependent cell signaling is specific for c-Raf/MEK/Erk pathway.Elk-1 is a well known transcription factor that is phosphorylated and activated by Erk (29Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 91-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). We, thus, studied whether 4 CRUs of Ahnak can potentiate the Elk activation in response to PMA. We transiently transfected the Elk-1 dependent luciferase reporter with vector pcDNA3(HA) or pcDNA3(HA)-4 CRUs in NIH3T3 cells and exposed to 10 ng/ml PMA for 7 h. PMA activated Elk-1 transcriptional activity by 12-fold in control cells, whereas the basal and PMA-induced transcriptional activity of Elk-1 were increased in NIH3T3 cells expressing 4 CRUs of Ahnak by 6- and 70-fold, respectively (Fig. 3D). The result suggests that Ahnak enhances PKC-mediated Elk-1 activation pathway in cells.Failure of PKC Activation in Ahnak Null MEF Cells—To verify the function of Ahnak in cell signaling, we made Ahnak gene knock-out mouse by ho"

Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that OPN contributes to erythroblast proliferation.

We also show that OPN mediates phosphorylation or activation of multiple proteins including Rac-1 GTPase and the actin-binding protein, adducin, in human erythroblasts. In addition, we show that the OPN effects include regulation of intracellular calcium in human erythroblasts. Finally, we demonstrate that human erythroblasts express CD44 and integrins β1 and α4, three known receptors for OPN, and that the integrin β1 receptor is involved in transmitting the proliferative signal.

Together these two growth factors guide the erythroid differentiation program from the early basophilic stage through the late polychromatic stage of maturation. However, the effects of these cytokines explain only the early stages of erythropoiesis. We were interested in identifying additional cytokines and/or factors involved in the erythroid differentiation program, especially factors that regulate the remodeling of the cytoskeleton. To achieve these objectives we developed methods to obtain extremely pure primary erythroblasts that synchronously differentiate into reticulocytes. Utilizing these cells, we screened a cDNA microarray and identified OPN as one of the cytokines that is highly expressed by erythroblasts during differentiation. erythropoietin 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide wild type phosphate-buffered saline osteopontin stem cell factor quantitative PCR hematocrit glycophorin A hemoglobin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay small interfering RNA. erythropoietin 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide wild type phosphate-buffered saline osteopontin stem cell factor quantitative PCR hematocrit glycophorin A hemoglobin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay small interfering RNA. OPN is a multifunctional cytokine that is highly expressed during bone remodeling and has pro-inflammatory effects (7Koury S.T. Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. J.

OPN has anti-apoptotic, chemotactic, and proliferative properties, depending on the cell type and context. It also plays a vital role in the delayed-type immune response and is known to be secreted by activated T cells and macrophages (13Denhardt D.T. Giachelli C.M. Rittling S.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). OPN knock-out mice are viable and live a normal life span but suffer from bone defects and problems with wound and fracture healing (14Duvall C.L. Taylor W.R. Weiss D. Wojtowicz A.M. Guldberg R.E. J. Bone Miner Res. 2007; 22: 286-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To date, OPN has not been shown to be expressed by erythroblasts, nor has it been implicated in functions associated with erythroid cell maturation. Here, we demonstrate that OPN is expressed by erythroblasts and contributes to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and proliferation. We also demonstrate that stimulation of erythroblast cells by OPN induces activation and/or phosphorylation of Rac-1 GTPase and other intracellular proteins, including efflux of intracellular calcium. Finally, our studies show that OPN receptors CD44 and several integrins are expressed in these cells and suggest that integrin β1 is responsible for transmitting the proliferative signal. Collectively, our data define a cytokine important in the regulation of multiple functions during the erythroid differentiation program. Antibodies and Reagents—Initial microarray studies that identified OPN expression by erythroblasts were carried out by Memorec Biotec Inc. in Cologne, Germany (a Miltenyi Biotec company). Both fluorochrome-conjugated and non-conjugated glycophorin A (GlyA) antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences, Inc. The transferrin receptor (CD71) antibody was purchased from Beckman Coulter, Inc. Recombinant OPN and recombinant SCF were from R & D, Inc. The anti-phospho adducin Ser-724 antibody (cat. no. 05-587), which also recognizes phospho adducin Ser-726 in human cells, was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The anti-phosphothreonine (cat. no. 71-8200)-specific antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. The anti-OPN antibody used for immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence was from R & D, Inc. Fluorescently labeled phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes. Fluo-3/AM was purchased from VWR International. The A23187 calcium ionophore was purchased from Calbiochem, Inc. The Rac inhibitor, NSC23766 (cat. no. 553502) was purchased from Calbiochem Inc. Primary Human Erythroid Cultures and Flow Cytometry—Human primary erythroblasts were generated by culturing CD34+ early hematopoietic progenitors initially isolated from growth factor-mobilized peripheral blood (purchased from ALL Cells, Inc.) using an Isolex 300i cell selection device. The culture contained 15% fetal bovine serum, 15% human serum, Isocove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM), 10 ng/ml interleukin-3, 2 units/ml EPO, and 50 ng/ml SCF. During the initial 8 days of culture, cells were fed on days 3 and 6 by adding equal volumes of fresh culture media supplemented with growth factors. However, no new interleukin-3 was added after the initial addition on day 0, and the amount of SCF added to the fresh media was gradually decreased at each feeding (day 3, 25 ng/ml; day 6, 10 ng/ml; day 8, 2 ng/ml). The amount of EPO added was 2 units/ml during each feeding. On day 8 of culture, cells were further purified by flow cytometry sorting for Gly A/CD71 or CD71 cells using a MoFlo high speed flow cytometer. The purity of the population isolated by this method was 98-99%. Sorted cells were cultured in the same media as before with EPO and SCF, except the concentration of SCF was reduced to 2 ng/ml. Cells were fed one more time on day 10 of culture by adding equal volumes of fresh media with only EPO (2 units/ml) during this final feeding. Cells were collected at various time points during the culture and stained with benzidine and hematoxylin, as described previously, to monitor the differentiation program (15Wickrema A. Krantz S.B. Winkelmann J.C. Bondurant M.C. Blood. 1992; 80: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bone marrow-derived erythroblasts were isolated by selection of CD71-positive cells from mononuclear cells obtained from bone marrow aspirates of volunteer donors. CD71-positive cells were cultured until used for qPCR analysis. PCR Amplification—Real-time PCR was performed using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Inc.) on the MyiQ instrument (Bio-Rad) using OPN and 18 S ribosomal RNA gene primers (OPN: forward, 5′-TTGCAGTGATTTGCTTTTGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTCATGGCTTTCGTTGGACT-3′; 18s: forward, 5′-ATGCCCGTTCTTAGTTGGTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGCTGAGCCAGTCAGTGTAG-3′). PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C, 15 s, 55 °C, 30 s, and 72 °C, 30 s. The melting curve analysis was performed by increasing the temperature from 55 to 95 °C at 0.5 °C/10 s and measuring the fluorescence intensity at the interval. Relative RNA levels of the target gene in each sample were determined by the ΔΔCT method and normalized against the RNA level of 18 S in each sample. OPN Stimulation, Immunoblot Analysis, and ELISA—Primary erythroblast cells on day 9 or 10 of culture were collected and washed twice with IMDM media to eliminate any secreted OPN from the culture media. Cells were then incubated in serum-free media (IMDM/1% bovine serum albumin) for 4.5 h prior to stimulation with OPN. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (16Wickrema A. Uddin S. Sharma A. Chen F. Alsayed Y. Ahmad S. Sawyer S.T. Krystal G. Yi T. Nishada K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24469-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An ELISA for OPN was performed using medium collected from cultures where cells had been seeded at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml. After 3-4 days of culture, the medium was collected and subsequently used in the ELISA assay. Also, an OPN ELISA was performed using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Assay Design, Inc.). Isolation and Culture of Mouse Erythroblasts from OPN-/- Mice—Mice (B6.Cg-Spp1tm1Blh/J, cat. no. 004936) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. The genotype of mice was confirmed by PCR of tail DNA using primers, as suggested by the Jackson Laboratory. Pure C57BL/6 mice (WT) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory as experimental controls. All animal research was approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. To obtain bone marrow cells, mouse femurs and tibiae were flushed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing citrate and passaged through a 20-gauge syringe to obtain a single cell suspension. To isolate erythroblasts, the cells were stained with PE-conjugated Ter119 antibodies and sorted using a MoFlo-HTS cell sorter (Dako Cytomation) or selected for CD71 using the EasySep magnetic selection method. Selected and/or sorted cells were cytospun onto slides and stained with benzidine and hematoxylin for morphological evaluation and immobilized on Alcian Blue (Sigma)-treated coverslips for immunofluorescence analysis to evaluate F-actin distribution. In the experiment where the effect of OPN on F-actin cytoskeleton was determined, CD71-positive erythroblasts were cultured in 30% bovine serum, 0.1 mmol/liter α-thioglycerol, IMDM, and 1 unit /ml EPO for 16 h in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml OPN prior to immunofluorescence analysis for F-actin. As a control, WT mouse erythroblasts were also cultured under similar conditions but without OPN. In experiments where Complete Blood Count (CBC) for mouse blood was obtained, about 20 μl of mouse blood were collected from the mouse tail vein. HEMVET 850 was used to determine CBC for blood samples within 3 h. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on human and mouse cells after immobilizing and fixing cells on Alcian Blue-treated coverslips. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and washed 5 min prior to blocking with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. In experiments where OPN was localized in human erythroblasts, cells were incubated with anti-OPN antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.01% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 1 h, and washed in PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody at room temperature for 45 min before washing in the same buffer as before. Incubation with anti-GlyA antibody was performed at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed in the same buffer before the incubation of Alexa Fluor-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed in PBS, the coverglasses were allowed to air-dry, and were mounted with Prolong Gold mounting medium (Invitrogen). In experiments where the localization of F-actin was performed, both human and mouse erythroblasts were stained using Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin according to the manufacturer's suggested procedure (Molecular Probes). All photographs were taken using a Leica SP2 AOBS spectral confocal microscope under a ×63 oil immersion lens. siRNA Transfection—Day 6 erythroblasts (basophilic) or day 9 GlyA/CD71 cells (polychromatic) were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells in 0.5 ml of growth medium per well in a 12-well plate. In a 1.5-ml tube, 100 μl of serum-free medium and 3 μl of the TransIT-siQUEST transfection reagent (Mirus, Bio Corp.) were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 50-100 nm of either control siRNA or OPN siRNA (Dharmacon, Inc.) were added and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The TransIT-siQUEST reagent/siRNA complex mixture was added dropwise to the cells. The plate was gently rocked and incubated for 24-72 h. The knock-down of target gene expression was tested by real-time PCR or Western blot analysis. The suppression of OPN expression was effective for up to 72 h. Rac-1 Assay—Erythroblasts (day 9) in culture were placed in fresh serum-free medium for 2 h with or without the Rac inhibitor prior to stimulation with OPN. Equal amounts of lysates (500 μg) were incubated with GST-Pak1-PBD (to pull-down active GTP-bound Rac-1) in the presence of SwellGel™-immobilized glutathione at 4 °C for 1 h in a spin column (Pierce EZ-Detect Rac1 Activation kit). The samples were subsequently analyzed for bound Rac-1 by immunoblot analysis using an anti-Rac-1 antibody. Calcium Efflux Assay—Day 10 human erythroblasts were centrifuged in medium at 400 × g, and the medium was aspirated. Cells were washed three times in HEPES-G (123 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and consecutively centrifuged at 800, 600, and 500 × g.40 μl of cells were added to 20 ml of HEPES-G in a 50-ml sterile conical tube (0.2% Hct). The tube was covered with aluminum foil to exclude light. 20 μl of 2 mm fluo-3/AM stock were added to the tube. The sample was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with shaking. An additional 20 μl of 2 mm fluo-3/AM stock were added to each tube. The sample was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 45 min with shaking. The sample was centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The sample was washed twice in PBS-G (PBS, 10 mm glucose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The sample was transferred to 15-ml conical tubes, washed once in HEPES-G, and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was aspirated. The cells were resuspended in 2 ml of HEPES-G (1% Hct) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Prior to flux studies, 100 μl of loaded cells were added to 1400 μl of HEPES-G in a glass cuvette. Cells were stimulated at 60 s with no stimulant, 1 μg/ml OPN, or 1 μm A23187. A fourth sample was preincubated with 1 μg/ml OPN for 3 min and stimulated at 60 s with 1 μm A23187. Loaded cells were excited at 506 nm, and the fluorescence emission was recorded at 530 nm using a fluorimeter (Aminco Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer). Triplicate trials were run for each sample. Detection of Receptors for OPN Engagement—Day 10 erythroblasts were used to detect the cell surface expression of CD44, CD44v6, integrins β1, α4, β5, and αvβ3 along with glycophorin A by flow cytometry. Antibodies against CD44, integrin β1 (CD29), integrin α4 (CD49d), and integrin β5 were from eBioscience Inc. The antibody against CD44v6 was purchased from R & D Inc. The antibody against integrin αvβ3 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used as positive controls for receptors that did not show expression in erythroblasts. Cell Proliferation Assays—In the experiments where proliferation effects of OPN were determined, mouse CD71-positive erythroblasts from WT and OPN-/- mice were cultured for 48 h prior to determining the level of proliferation. In the experiment where the effect of neutralizing antibodies on cell proliferation was determined, day 9 human erythroblasts were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 20 μg/ml for each antibody. None of the antibodies utilized in cell culture contained sodium azide, which is used as an antibacterial agent in most commercial antibodies. Cell proliferation was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol (Sigma). OPN Expression by Highly Purified Human Erythroblasts—To obtain an extremely pure erythroid cell population that differentiates in a synchronous manner, we used a primary human erythroid cell culture system, which was modified from our previous work (17Uddin S. Ah-Kang J. Ulaszek J. Mahmud D. Wickrema A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We initially cultured CD34-positive early hematopoietic cells under conditions that promote commitment and differentiation to the erythroid lineage. During the mid-phase of in vitro culture, we selected a highly synchronous erythroblast population by flow cytometry sorting for GlyA- and CD71-positive cells (Fig. 1A). Sorted cells were 98-99% positive for the GlyA/CD71 population. We also confirmed the absence of other myeloid and lymphoid cell types after purification by flow cytometry analysis (data not shown). These cells were then recultured for another 6-8 days under conditions optimal for terminal differentiation to reticulocytes (Fig. 1B). Cells were collected at several time points during culture and stained for hemoglobin (benzidine) to monitor terminal differentiation (Fig. 1B). The OPN expression was evaluated using qPCR for OPN mRNA at the following stages of the differentiation program: CD34-positive cells (day 0), polychromatic erythroblasts (day 9), orthochromatic erythroblasts (day 12), and enucleating late stage erythroblasts (day 13) (Fig. 1C). Transcripts for OPN were present in CD34-positive early hematopoietic cells and at all stages of differentiation, but the highest levels were observed at later time points peaking on day 12 of culture (Fig. 1C). To exclude the possibility that OPN is expressed by erythroblasts as a result of growth factor mobilization (source of our CD34 cells), we also cultured erythroblasts (CD71-selected) isolated directly from bone marrow aspirates of volunteer donors. These studies confirmed that OPN is expressed by bone marrow-isolated erythroblasts, although to a lesser extent in comparison to peripheral blood-derived cells (Fig. 1D). We then determined OPN protein expression by immunoblot analysis using cell lysates collected at various time points during culture. The OPN protein was detectable at all stages of erythroid differentiation (Fig. 2A). The two erythroleukemia cell lines, K562 and HEL, which were used as negative controls, do not express OPN. We then reprobed the same immunoblot against anti-tubulin antibody to verify equal protein loading and with antibodies against protein band 3 (anion exchanger) to verify terminal differentiation. Band 3 is an erythroid transmembrane protein, which appears relatively late during the differentiation program, and is therefore an excellent marker of erythroid differentiation. Cellular Secretion and Localization of OPN—Because OPN is a secreted cytokine, we examined whether purified erythroblasts secrete OPN during their differentiation process. OPN was readily detectable by ELISA in culture medium of GlyA/CD71-positive erythroblasts (Fig. 2B). The level of OPN was especially high between days 8 and 11 of culture, during which time these cells rapidly synthesize hemoglobin as well as several other cytoskeleton proteins (18Wickrema A. Koury S.T. Dai C.H. Krantz S.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, OPN secretion persisted even during the very late stages of erythroid differentiation (days 14-19), suggesting continued autocrine and/or paracrine functions (Fig. 2B). We then examined the intracellular localization of OPN in differentiating erythroblasts on day 10 of culture. Using fluorescently labeled antibodies against OPN and GlyA (both indirect fluorescent conjugates), we observed the localization of OPN in GlyA-positive cells (day 10), further confirming that OPN is expressed by erythroid progenitors (Fig. 2C). OPN had a punctate appearance in cells and was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, whereas GlyA was localized to the cell membrane. Fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibody alone was used as a control, which did not react with erythroblast cells (Fig. 2C). OPN Regulates F-actin Filament Formation and Distribution—To investigate the functional relevance of OPN expression, we depleted OPN expression in human erythroblasts by siRNA. By transfecting cells with a pool (Smart Pool™) of siRNA directed against OPN, we were able to effectively inhibit the expression of OPN at the RNA and protein levels (Fig. 3, A and B). Because OPN regulates F-actin polymerization in the bone, we examined the impact of OPN depletion on F-actin reorganization during erythroid differentiation. In erythroblasts, F-actin is normally present in the peri-membrane region of the cells. The depletion of OPN resulted in a dramatic rearrangement of the distribution and appearance of F-actin in differentiating erythroblasts as determined by fluorescence microscopy using Texas-Red-conjugated phalloidin. The knock-down of OPN in human erythroblasts resulted in the reduction of actin filaments in the peri-membrane region of the cells and the appearance of aggregated bundles throughout the cytoplasmic region, which was evident under the oil immersion lens (Fig. 3C). We then examined cultured erythroblasts from the bone marrow of WT and OPN-/- mice, which showed that in OPN-/- mice, there were no definitive F-actin filaments along the peri-membrane region compared with WT mice. In these OPN-/- cells, F-actin had diffusely spread throughout the cytoplasm of cells (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, when we cultured the OPN-/- erythroblasts with recombinant mouse OPN, we were able to restore the F-actin filaments in the peri-membrane region of the cells (Fig. 3D). The changes in actin filaments were visible only at high magnification, although photomicrographs of larger fields allowed us to observe the overall expression in the total cell population. Signal Transduction by OPN—To identify the upstream signaling elements responsible for the regulation of actin polymerization by OPN in erythroblasts, we investigated whether Rac-1 GTPase, a known signaling intermediate of actin remodeling, is activated by OPN. Rac-1 belongs to the Rho family of GTPases and binds its downstream effector PAK-1 to initiate the signaling cascade upon Rac-1 activation by extracellular ligands (19Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). We tested Rac-1 activation in response to OPN by performing a Rac-1 binding assay on total cell lysates from human erythroblasts. Stimulation by exogenous OPN resulted in a 50% increase in Rac-1 binding to PAK-1, compared with the unstimulated sample (Fig. 4A). Moreover, pretreatment of cells with a Rac GTPase inhibitor (NSC23766) prior to OPN stimulation suppressed the extent of binding, demonstrating that Rac-1 GTPase is a target of OPN (Fig. 4A). We then focused on adducin, an actin-binding protein that plays an important role in actin filament regulation in the erythroid cytoskeleton. Three isoforms (α, β, γ) of adducin are present in the erythroblast cytoskeleton and have phosphorylation sites that are substrates for multiple kinases. Although protein kinases A and C are known to phosphorylate adducin (20Matsuoka Y. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25157-25166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), cytokine-induced phosphorylation of adducin is not known. To determine if OPN stimulation leads to adducin phosphorylation, total cell lysates were collected after OPN stimulation (for various times or for 30 min with increasing concentrations of OPN) and immunoblotted with an anti-phosphoserine 726 antibody. These experiments showed that OPN stimulation leads to phosphorylation of α and/or β isoforms (120/110 kDa) in a dose- and time-dependent manner that exceeds any basal phosphorylation levels, as indicated by the relative ratios of the band intensities (Fig. 4, B and C). To further explore whether other proteins are also phosphorylated in response to OPN, we used pan anti-phosphothreonine antibody to investigate general phosphorylation patterns in erythroblasts. This experiment revealed that at least three other proteins were phosphorylated at threonine sites, suggesting the involvement of OPN as a signal transducer in erythroid cells (Fig. 4D). The molecular sizes of these proteins were ∼120, 30, and 27 kDa. The kinetics of phosphorylation of all proteins showed a maximum level of phosphorylation between 5 and 15 min after exposure, indicating that the OPN effect on erythroblasts in terms of signal transduction is quite rapid (Fig. 4D). Intracellular Calcium Is Regulated by OPN—Because OPN has been linked to regulation of Ca2+ absorption in bone, we used a fluorescence assay to investigate the role of OPN in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+. Exogenous OPN stimulation of erythroblasts induced efflux of Ca2+ from the cells, as demonstrated by decreased fluorescence intensity compared with control samples that were not stimulated by OPN (Fig. 5). As a positive control, cells were stimulated with A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, which induced a dramatic increase in fluorescence intensity corresponding to rapid Ca2+ influx. The incubation of OPN in A23187-treated cells resulted in a relative reduction of Ca2+ influx compared with the positive control. Because calcium often acts as a signaling mediator, OPN stimulation of erythroblast"
https://openalex.org/W2051815976,"Reproductive isolation between biological species is characterized by Haldane's rule, which states that the heterogametic sex (XY or ZW) suffers the most dysfunctional effects of hybridization. It has been hypothesized that, in addition to X-linked recessive genes, Haldane's rule also reflects the faster evolution of genes related to male reproduction (faster-male evolution). We used sex-reversed hybrid Xenopus to test faster-male evolution by examining the fertility of sex-reversed individuals with the genotype of the inverse phenotypic sex. Hybrid males are sterile and hybrid females are fertile irrespective of their genotypic sex. Gene expression profiles match these adult phenotypes, and our results demonstrate that faster-male evolution is the most likely mechanism producing hybrid male sterility."
https://openalex.org/W2015497989,"We have studied the uptake and metabolism of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major phospholipid of low density lipoproteins (LDL), by cultures of primary hepatocytes. Strikingly, in the absence of the LDL receptor, PC incorporation into hepatocytes was inhibited by only 30%, whereas cholesteryl ether uptake was inhibited by 60-70%. On the other hand, scavenger receptor class B, type I, the other important receptor for LDL in the liver, was found to be responsible for the uptake of the remaining 30-40% of LDL-cholesteryl ether. PC uptake was, however, only partially inhibited (30%) in scavenger receptor class B, type I, knock-out hepatocytes. Once LDL-PC was taken up by hepatocytes, ∼50% of LDL-[3H]oleate-PC was converted to triacylglycerol rather than degraded in lysosomes as occurs for LDL-derived cholesteryl esters. The remainder of the LDL-derived PC was not significantly metabolized to other products. Triacylglycerol synthesis from LDL-PC requires a PC-phospholipase C activity as demonstrated by inhibition with the phospholipase C inhibitor D609 or activation with rattlesnake venom. Small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), but not DGAT1, decreased the acylation of the LDL-derived diacylglycerol. These findings show that PC in LDL particles is taken up not only by the classical receptors but also by additional mechanism(s) followed by metabolism that is completely different from the cholesteryl esters or apoB100, the other main components of LDL. We have studied the uptake and metabolism of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major phospholipid of low density lipoproteins (LDL), by cultures of primary hepatocytes. Strikingly, in the absence of the LDL receptor, PC incorporation into hepatocytes was inhibited by only 30%, whereas cholesteryl ether uptake was inhibited by 60-70%.

Small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), but not DGAT1, decreased the acylation of the LDL-derived diacylglycerol. These findings show that PC in LDL particles is taken up not only by the classical receptors but also by additional mechanism(s) followed by metabolism that is completely different from the cholesteryl esters or apoB100, the other main components of LDL.

Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar). An increased level of LDL-cholesteryl esters (LDL-CE) is associated with enhanced risk of atherosclerosis, leading to cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack and stroke (2Scott J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3Rosenson R.S. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 173: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The pioneering work of Brown and Goldstein in the 1970s on the cellular basis of cholesterol homeostasis led to the detailed characterization of the uptake and metabolism of LDL following receptor-mediated endocytosis. In this pathway, LDL binds to the LDL receptor (LDLR) (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 5Goldstein J.L.

Cell. 1977; 10: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). After endocytosis, cholesteryl esters (CE) and apoB100 are hydrolyzed in the lysosomes (5Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4288-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the LDLR is mainly recycled to the plasma membrane (10Basu S.K.

It is now clear that LDL also delivers LDL-CE to cells via “selective uptake,” a process in which LDL-CE is taken up without intracellular apolipoprotein degradation (11Azhar S. Cooper A. Tsai L. Maffe W. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 869-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Green S.R. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 667-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several proteins appear to be involved in the selective uptake of CE such as lipoprotein lipase and proteoglycans (13Seo T. Al-Haideri M. Treskova E. Worgall T.S. Kako Y. Goldberg I.J. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30355-30362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), apoE, LDL receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (14Swarnakar S.

Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29733-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Rhainds D. Brodeur M. Lapointe J. Charpentier D. Falstrault L. Brissette L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7527-7538Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A variety of ligands, including native lipoproteins (LDL, high density lipoproteins (HDL), very low density lipoproteins, and chylomicrons) and modified lipoproteins (acetylated LDL, oxidized LDL, and oxidized HDL), can bind to SR-BI (17Trigatti B.L. Krieger M. Rigotti A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1732-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Specific amino acid residues of SR-BI are involved in its binding to the various ligands (18Gu X. Lawrence R. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which SR-BI mediates selective lipid uptake from lipoproteins is unknown. At least two models have been proposed as follows: the first suggests that selective uptake takes place at the plasma membrane (19Nieland T.J. Ehrlich M. Krieger M. Kirchhausen T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1734: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and that SR-BI creates a hydrophobic channel allowing CE to be moved down its concentration gradient into the plasma membrane (20Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The second model postulates that lipids are exchanged after internalization of lipoproteins, and later the lipid-depleted particles are then resecreted, resulting in selective lipid uptake (21Silver D.L. Wang N. Xiao X. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25287-25293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 22Pagler T.A. Rhode S. Neuhofer A. Laggner H. Strobl W.

Chem. 2006; 281: 11193-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Regardless of the precise mechanism, LDL-CE is taken up by selective uptake and is degraded in lysosomes (23Rhainds D. Falstrault L. Tremblay C. Brissette L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HDL-CE is mainly hydrolyzed in an extralysosomal compartment (24Sparrow C.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), although partial lysosomal involvement was also described (23Rhainds D. Falstrault L. Tremblay C. Brissette L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). More recently, a new player in cholesterol homeostasis has been described. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 is a protein that induces degradation of LDLR in the liver and hence adds a new dimension to the regulation of plasma LDL levels (25McNutt M.C. Lagace T.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20799-20803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26Zhang D.W. Lagace T.A. Garuti R. Zhao Z. McDonald M. Horton J.D.

Overexpression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 leads to hypercholesterolemia (28Maxwell K.N. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7100-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 expression is associated with increased expression of LDLR and therefore low levels of LDL-CE (29Rashid S. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. Anderson N.N. Bashmakov Y. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Moon Y.A. Horton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5374-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Despite the considerable attention devoted to studying the metabolism of LDL-CE and apoB100, much less is known about the uptake and metabolism of phospholipids associated with LDL. The fate of PC on HDL and LDL when incorporated into human platelets was investigated. Rapid incorporation of PC was shown to supply platelets and monocytes with polyunsaturated fatty acids (arachidonic acid) for the production of eicosanoids (30Engelmann B. Kogl C. Kulschar R. Schaipp B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Engelmann B. Schaipp B. Dobner P. Stoeckelhuber M. Kogl C. Siess W. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27800-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Dobner P. Engelmann B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E777-E784PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that phospholipid transfer from LDL to platelets is independent of the high affinity binding of LDL to platelets and was stimulated by wheat germ agglutinin (33Dobner P. Koller E. Engelmann B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In monocytes, high affinity binding of LDL was shown to involve SR-BI that mediated the selective import of the major lipoprotein-associated phospholipids (34Urban S. Zieseniss S. Werder M. Hauser H. Budzinski R. Engelmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33409-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A role for SR-BI in PC uptake from LDL and HDL by endothelial cells was also demonstrated by Sattler and co-workers (35Sovic A. Balazs Z. Hrzenjak A. Reicher H. Panzenboeck U. Malle E. Sattler W. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 368: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although liver is the primary site of clearance of LDL (36Ma P.T. Yamamoto T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), there is no information on the fate of LDL-PC in hepatocytes. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to study the uptake and further metabolism of LDL-PC in hepatic cells. Materials—McArdle RH-7777 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (v/v) and 10% horse serum. Collagen-coated dishes for culture of hepatocytes were from BD Biosciences. [3H]Oleic acid, [3H]palmitic acid, [3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether, and [methyl-3H]choline chloride were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Silica Gel G60 thin layer plates were from Merck. Rabbit polyclonal anti-rat LDLR antibody was provided by Dr. G. Ness (University of South Florida, Tampa). Goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, biotin, and neutravidin were from Pierce. Tricyclodecan-9-yl xanthogenate·K (D609), (±)1-(isopropylamino)-3-(1-naphthyloxy)-2-propanol·HCl, and arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (ATK) were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Me-indoxam was kindly provided by Dr. M. Gelb (University of Washington, Seattle). siRNA (a pool of three oligonucleotides) targeted to DGAT1 and DGAT2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). TRIzol reagent, (dT)12-18 primer, Superscript II reverse transcriptase, and Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG were from Invitrogen. All other reagents were of the highest purity available and were from Sigma. Animal Care—All procedures were approved by Institutional Animal Care Committees at either the University of Alberta or McMaster University and were in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Male mice (3-6 months old) from C57BL/6 (wild type), LDLR knock-out, SR-BI knock-out, hepatic lipase knock-out, and apoE knock-out mice were fed ad libitum a chow diet (LabDiet, PICO laboratory Rodent Diet 20) and were exposed to a 12-h light/dark cycle starting at 8:00 a.m. Preparation and Labeling of Lipoproteins—LDL was isolated from healthy human donors by ultracentrifugation (density = 1.020-1.063 g/ml). First, the density of plasma was adjusted to 1.019 g/ml with KBr and the sample centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 24 h at 8 °C to remove very low density lipoproteins. The density was adjusted to 1.063 g/ml with KBr, and the sample was centrifuged under the same conditions. The LDL fraction was recovered from the top and dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, pH 7.5. LDL were stored under nitrogen at 4 °C. Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) was prepared by adjusting plasma to d = 1.215 g/ml with KBr and centrifugation at 99,000 rpm for 4 h at 8 °C in a tabletop Beckman ultracentrifuge, rotor TLA 100.4. LPDS was dialyzed against the buffer above and served as the source of phospholipid transfer protein and CE transfer protein. Liposomes were prepared by drying 50 μCi of [3H]PC under nitrogen and resuspension of the lipid in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and sonication for 5 min using a tip sonicator (15-s cycles). Some experiments in addition to [3H]PC also used 50 μCi of [3H]cholesteryl ether (CEt), a nonhydrolyzable analog of CE. The resulting small unilamellar vesicles were mixed with LPDS and freshly prepared LDL. EDTA and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid were added to a final concentration of 1 mm and 100 μm, respectively. The mixture was incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in an orbital shaker (250 rpm). After incubation, [3H]LDL was re-purified by ultracentrifugation as described above. Isolation and Culture of Primary Hepatic Cells—Hepatocytes were isolated from mice after liver perfusion with collagenase as described (37Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 60-mm collagen-coated dishes at a density of 9 × 105 cells/dish. Unless stated otherwise, hepatocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Two h after plating, the cultures were rinsed in DMEM containing 10% FBS, and then incubated in the same medium for 12 h. Prior to experiments, cultures were rinsed twice in serum-free DMEM over a 1-h period and then incubated in serum-free DMEM with radiolabeled LDL as described below. PC Labeling—Four dishes of confluent McArdle RH-7777 cells were incubated for 12 h with 50 μCi of either [3H]oleic acid, [3H]palmitic acid, or [methyl-3H]choline chloride. Cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped. Lipids were extracted in chloroform/methanol (2:1). [3H]PC was purified by TLC in the solvent system (chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 25:15:4:2). [3H]PC was stored at -20 °C under nitrogen until used for labeling of LDL. LDL Uptake—Hepatocytes were preincubated with or without the specified inhibitors and chemicals for 1 h prior to the addition of 50 μg of [3H]LDL protein/ml. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Media were removed, and cellular monolayers were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested; homogenates were sonicated for 10 s; lipids were extracted (38Folch J. Lees M. Stanley Sloane G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phospholipids were separated by TLC (chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 25:15:4:2) until the solvent reached halfway up the plate. The solvent was evaporated from the plate, and the neutral lipids were separated in the solvent heptane/diisopropyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:4). Following iodine visualization, bands corresponding to specific lipids were scraped, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Water-soluble compounds were obtained from the aqueous phase after lipid extraction. Because of the low radioactivity of the samples, they were dried under nitrogen; 50 μl of water/methanol (1:1) was added, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Quantification of Cell Surface LDLR—The surface expression of LDLR was estimated by biotinylation of the cell surface proteins (39Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes were treated with the indicated inhibitors and then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Sulfo-NHS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline was added, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed, and excess biotin was quenched with 100 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline. Hepatocytes were lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 4 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). After removal of cell debris, biotinylated proteins were collected on neutravidin-agarose. The samples were eluted from beads with boiling SDS electrophoresis sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-LDLR antibody. Induction of PC-PLC Activity—Snake venom from Crotalus atrox (Western Diamondback Rattlesnake) was used for inducing PC-PLC activity (40Zhao Q. Araki S. Zhang S. Miao J. Toxicon. 2004; 44: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A 2 μg/μl venom stock solution was treated with 5 mm Me-indoxam (41Hagishita S. Yamada M. Shirahase K. Okada T. Murakami Y. Ito Y. Matsuura T. Wada M. Kato T. Ueno M. Chikazawa Y. Yamada K. Ono T. Teshirogi I. Ohtani M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3636-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) for 30 min at room temperature to eliminate all PLA2 activity. A final concentration of 4 μg/ml of venom was incubated with hepatocytes. Cellular toxicity was evaluated by the release of LDH. Briefly, culture media were collected after different treatments and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. LDH activity was measured spectro-photometrically at 340 nm by following the oxidation of NADH in the presence of pyruvate. Total LDH per culture was determined from 0.1% Triton X-100 lysates of untreated control cultures. Lipid composition after treatment was analyzed by phosphorous content as described (42Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Treatment with Phospholipases—Phospholipase incubations were performed as described by Hassan et al. (43Hassan H.H. Denis M. Lee D.Y. Iatan I. Nyholt D. Ruel I. Krimbou L. Genest J. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2428-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with few modifications. Briefly, primary hepatocytes were incubated for 1 h in DMEM containing 50 μg of [3H]LDL protein/ml. After washing to remove unbound lipoproteins, hepatocytes were treated with 0.5 units/ml PC-PLC or 1 unit/ml sphingomyelinase (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Media were removed, and cellular monolayers were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested; homogenates were sonicated for 10 s, and lipids were extracted. Cellular toxicity under treatment with phospholipases was evaluated by the release of LDH as described above. Silencing of DGAT1 and DGAT2—Commercial siRNAs specific for DGAT1 and DGAT2 were used. The transfection medium was prepared as follows: 5 μl of Lipofectamine and 100 pmol of siRNA-DGAT1 or siRNA-DGAT2 were diluted in 100 μl of serum-free and antibiotic-free DMEM. The complex was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then diluted with 1.4 ml of William's E medium containing 5% FBS. Two hours after plating, hepatocytes were washed twice with William's E medium containing 5% FBS, and then transfection medium was added. Cells were incubated for 12 h with siRNA-containing medium, and the medium was changed to William's E medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were incubated 24 h prior to the start of experiments. RNA Isolation and Real Time PCR—RNA from hepatocytes was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was then reverse-transcribed using an (dT)12-18 primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions. DGAT1, DGAT2, and cyclophilin transcripts were detected by real time PCR using a Rotor-Gene 3000 instrument (Montreal Biotech). Reaction mixtures contained 0.25 μm of each primer and Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG, in a total volume of 25 μl. Data analyses were performed using the Rotor-Gene 6.0.19 program (Montreal Biotech). PCR Primer Sequences—All primers were designed using Oligo 6.7 (Molecular Biology Insights, Inc., Cascade, CO) and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The primers used are as follows: dgat1F, 5′-GGA TCT GAG GTG CCA TCG T-3′, and dgat1R, 5′-CCA CCA GGA TGC CAT ACT TG-3′; dgat2F, 5′-GGC TAC GTT GGC TGG TAA CTT-3′, and dgat2R, 5′-TTC AGG GTG ACT GCG TTC TT-3′; cyclo1A, 5′-TCC AAA GAC AGC AGA AAA CTT TCG-3′, and cyclo2B, 5′-TCT TCT TGC TGG TCT TGC CAT TCC-3′. LDL-PC Avoids Lysosomal Degradation—LDL particles are well known to be internalized by cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and sorted to the lysosomes where components are hydrolyzed (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar). To study the metabolism of LDL-PC, [3H]choline-labeled PC was used. As shown in Fig. 1A, during an 8-h incubation with primary mouse hepatocytes, radioactivity remained associated mainly with the PC fraction with negligible radioactivity in sphingomyelin or lyso-PC. Surprisingly, only a small fraction of radioactivity was found associated with water-soluble metabolites. Indeed, choline-derived aqueous compounds represented less than 10% of total radioactivity at all time points and were generated at the lysosomes, because chloroquine inhibited the degradation of this minor fraction of LDL-PC (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that most LDL-PC avoided lysosomal degradation, which would have been the expected consequence of being internalized by the LDLR. Chloroquine, as well as monensin, inhibited LDLR recycling to the plasma membrane as demonstrated by a biotinylation assay but neither compound modified the total cellular expression of LDLR (Fig. 1C). SR-BI surface expression was inhibited to some extent by monensin, in agreement with previous reports (44Zhang Y. Ahmed A.M. McFarlane N. Capone C. Boreham D.R. Truant R. Igdoura S.A. Trigatti B.L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but not by chloroquine (see below). For that reason, the uptake of LDL-PC was measured in the presence of these inhibitors. The uptake of LDL-CEt was measured as well as a control, because LDL-CE uptake and degradation by lysosomes are well known. As expected, the uptake of LDL-CEt was greatly reduced by chloroquine and monensin after 3 h of incubation (Fig. 1D), suggesting that CEt is taken up mainly by the LDLR in primary hepatocytes. The uptake of LDL-PC was slightly lower in the presence of chloroquine, although it did not reach statistical significance and was moderately inhibited by monensin (Fig. 1E). Because both inhibitors were likely blocking LDLR recycling, the results suggest that LDL-PC can be delivered to hepatocytes by an LDLR-independent pathway. The Role of LDL Receptor and SR-BI in LDL-PC Uptake by Mouse Hepatocytes—To determine the role that LDLR plays in LDL-PC uptake, hepatocytes were prepared from both wild type and LDLR knock-out mice. In agreement with the chloroquine experiments (Fig. 1), LDL-CEt uptake was inhibited by >70% in LDLR knock-out cells (Fig. 2A). However, LDL-PC uptake was only inhibited by up to 30% in cells lacking LDLR (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that although some LDL-PC is taken up during endocytosis of LDL and is subsequently degraded in lysosomes, most (>70%) LDL-PC is delivered by alternative pathways. It is noteworthy that neither monensin nor chloroquine induced any further inhibition of LDL-CE or LDL-PC uptake in LDLR knock-out hepatocytes (data not shown), suggesting that there is no LDLR-independent effect of these agents. SR-BI is considered an important receptor not only for the selective uptake of HDL-CE but also for LDL-CE (16Rhainds D. Brodeur M. Lapointe J. Charpentier D. Falstrault L. Brissette L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7527-7538Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Two approaches were used to assess the involvement of SR-BI in LDL-PC uptake. First, a blocking antibody was used to inhibit SR-BI activity in wild type hepatocytes. Second, [3H]LDL uptake was measured in SR-BI-/--derived hepatocytes. Using the blocking antibody, the delivery of PC to hepatocytes was inhibited by 20% (Fig. 2C). LDL-PC uptake in SR-BI-/- hepatocytes was 30% less than in wild type cells (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, LDL-CEt uptake was inhibited by 40% with both approaches (Fig. 2, C and D). Consequently, as expected LDL-CEt is taken up mainly by the LDLR (60-70%), whereas the remainder is internalized by SR-BI (30-40%). In contrast, the uptake of LDL-PC cannot be completely explained by a combination of LDLR (30%) and SR-BI (20-30%). Therefore, other mechanisms must operate for LDL-PC uptake that are responsible for the remaining 40-50% of LDL-PC uptake. One possible uptake pathway might be the hydrolysis of LDL-PC in the medium or bound to the plasma membrane of the hepatocytes, thereby allowing lyso-PC to diffuse into the plasma membrane. Scagnelli et al. (45Scagnelli G.P. Cooper P.S. VandenBroek J.M. Berman W.F. Schwartz C.C. J. Biol.

We therefore inhibited phospholipase activities by using the following compounds: ATK, an i"

The high affinity binding site for PAI-1 is located within the N-terminal somatomedin B domain of vitronectin; however, several studies have suggested a second PAI-1-binding site within vitronectin. To investigate this secondary site, a vitronectin mutant lacking the somatomedin B domain (rΔsBVN) was engineered. The short deletion had no effect on heparin-binding, integrin-binding, or cellular adhesion. Binding to the urokinase receptor was completely abolished while PAI-1 binding was still observed, albeit with a lower affinity. Analytical ultracentrifugation on the PAI-1-vitronectin complex demonstrated that increasing NaCl concentration favors 1:1 versus 2:1 PAI-1-vitronectin complexes and hampers formation of higher order complexes, pointing to the contribution of charge-charge interactions for PAI-1 binding to the second site. Furthermore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between differentially labeled PAI-1 molecules confirmed that two independent molecules of PAI-1 are capable of binding to vitronectin. These results support a model for the assembly of higher order PAI-1-vitronectin complexes via two distinct binding sites in both proteins.

These results support a model for the assembly of higher order PAI-1-vitronectin complexes via two distinct binding sites in both proteins. First identified as serum-spreading factor, vitronectin was recognized as a protein in serum capable of promoting cellular adhesion and spreading (1Holmes R. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After these initial findings, further roles for vitronectin in maintaining hemostasis, wound healing, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis have been elucidated based on the diverse number of ligands with which it interacts. Vitronectin works to regulate hemostasis via interactions with heparin and PAI-1. 2The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, urokinase receptor; rVN, recombinant full-length vitronectin; rΔsBVN, recombinant vitronectin lacking the somatomedin B domain due to deletion of residues 1–40; mVN, multimeric vitronectin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; P1–P1′, Schecter and Berger nomenclature for the reactive center loop residues of PAI-1, where P1, P2, P3, P4,… and P1′, P2′, P3′, P4′,… denote those residues on the N-terminal and C-terminal sides of the scissile bond, respectively; 5-IAF, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein; TMRIA, tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide; PAI-1P1′-FL, PAI-1 labeled at the P1′ residue with 5-IAF; PAI-1P1′-TMR, PAI-1 labeled at the P1′ residue with TMRIA; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol. 2The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, urokinase receptor; rVN, recombinant full-length vitronectin; rΔsBVN, recombinant vitronectin lacking the somatomedin B domain due to deletion of residues 1–40; mVN, multimeric vitronectin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; P1–P1′, Schecter and Berger nomenclature for the reactive center loop residues of PAI-1, where P1, P2, P3, P4,… and P1′, P2′, P3′, P4′,… denote those residues on the N-terminal and C-terminal sides of the scissile bond, respectively; 5-IAF, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein; TMRIA, tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide; PAI-1P1′-FL, PAI-1 labeled at the P1′ residue with 5-IAF; PAI-1P1′-TMR, PAI-1 labeled at the P1′ residue with TMRIA; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol. Vitronectin competes for heparin binding with both thrombin and antithrombin, effectively reducing the anticoagulant ability of heparin (2Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because PAI-1 inhibits plasminogen activators that convert plasminogen into the protease plasmin, vitronectin acts to prevent fibrinolysis by prolonging the functional lifespan of PAI-1 and localizing it to fibrin clots (3Podor T.J. Campbell S. Chindemi P. Foulon D.M. Farrell D.H. Walton P.D. Weitz J.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7520-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A high resolution structure of vitronectin has not been determined, although a model of the domains of vitronectin was proposed based on computer-calculated structure predictions using threading and docking algorithms (4Xu D. Baburaj K. Peterson C.B. Xu Y. Proteins. 2001; 44: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This model predicted one complete and one incomplete β-propeller for the central and C-terminal domains, respectively, that comprise the majority of vitronectin between amino acids 131 and 456. The structure of the N-terminal somatomedin B domain (residues 1–51) could not be reliably modeled with the threading algorithm. However, direct structural determinations using NMR (5Mayasundari A.

Although there is some conflict among the structures that is rooted in the identification of disulfide bonds (6Kamikubo Y. De Guzman R. Kroon G. Curriden S. Neels J.G. Churchill M.J. Dawson P.

Sci. 2007; 16: 1502-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), in all of the structures on the somatomedin B domain, the most important feature is a single turn α-helix that defines the binding interface with PAI-1. Small-angle x-ray scattering on monomeric vitronectin generated a low resolution model that revealed a bi-lobed structure for vitronectin (14Lynn G.W. Heller W.T. Mayasundari A. Minor K.H. Peterson C.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Assembling the NMR and x-ray scattering data with the structure predicted from threading suggests that the C-terminal domain lies within a separate lobe from the N-terminal somatomedin B domain (14Lynn G.W. Heller W.T. Mayasundari A. Minor K.H. Peterson C.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PAI-1, the primary inhibitor of the plasminogen activators uPA and tissue plasminogen activator belongs to the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. PAI-1 shares the common structural features and mechanism of inhibition characteristic of the other inhibitory members of the serpin family (15Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 16Stout T.J. Graham H. Buckley D.I. Matthews D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8460-8469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of PAI-1 is composed of nine α-helices (hA–hI), three β-sheets (A, B, and C), and a solvent-exposed unstructured loop of ∼20 amino acids referred to as the reactive center loop, because it carries the inhibitory reactive peptide bond. The overall scaffold of the molecule is defined by the five-stranded central β-sheet A. PAI-1 spontaneously alters in conformation, converting from the active state to an energetically more favorable inactive latent state (16Stout T.J. Graham H. Buckley D.I. Matthews D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8460-8469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7505-7509Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), where the reactive center loop translocates into the central β-sheet. The interaction between vitronectin and PAI-1 has important consequences for the regulation of cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix of the vasculature. Vitronectin binds a number of integrins as well as the GPI-linked urokinase receptor, uPAR, at sites in the region of the somatomedin B domain. When PAI-1 binds the somatomedin B domain of vitronectin, it directly competes for binding with uPAR at an overlapping binding site, thereby inhibiting uPAR-mediated cellular adhesion (20Waltz D.A. Natkin L.R. Fujita R.M. Wei Y. Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 21Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated cellular attachment may also be affected by PAI-1 binding to the somatomedin B domain, presumably by blocking the RGD sequence (22Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), which is found at residues 45–47. PAI-1 has also been shown to detach cells by disrupting the binding of integrin-uPAR complexes to vitronectin, fibronectin, and collagen type-1 (23Czekay R.P. Aertgeerts K. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Because of the diverse roles of these proteins, investigating the nature of PAI-1 binding to vitronectin has been an important area of research. Much effort has been focused on defining the PAI-1-binding site within vitronectin. A large body of work has characterized the somatomedin B domain of vitronectin as the principal site of PAI-1 binding (21Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J.

The PAI-1-binding site within the somatomedin B domain has been restricted to amino acids 24–30 using monoclonal antibodies and mutagenesis (24Royle G. Deng G. Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic (9Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Nat. Struct.

Conversely, the complementary vitronectin binding site within PAI-1 has been thoroughly investigated. A region between helices D, E, and F in PAI-1 termed the flexible joint region was proposed to comprise the primary binding site for vitronectin by Lawrence et al. (27Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 1994 and was finally fully mapped to this region by Jensen et al. (28Jensen J.K. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in 2002. The epitope was later confirmed by x-ray crystallography studies of the PAI-1-somatomedin B complex (9Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, there is evidence that PAI-1 can bind to a region other than the somatomedin B domain of vitronectin. Competition experiments using synthetic peptides or monoclonal antibodies (29Gechtman Z. Sharma R. Kreizman T. Fridkin M. Shaltiel S.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have identified a PAI-1-binding site in the C-terminal region of vitronectin or a site in the connecting region (34Mimuro J. Muramatsu S. Kurano Y. Uchida Y. Ikadai H. Watanabe S. Sakata Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2314-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Studying vitronectin-PAI-1 complexes with analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a 2:1 PAI-1-vitronectin binding stoichiometry and the formation of higher order complexes at a PAI-1-vitronectin ratio of 4:2 (32Podor T.J.

These reports of alternative PAI-1-binding sites, coupled with the unusual stoichiometry of the vitronectin-PAI-1 complex, have caused us to pursue a deletion mutagenesis approach to address this problem. The studies reported here were designed to evaluate directly whether there is a second site for the binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin that lies outside the well characterized N-terminal site in the somatomedin B domain. A mutant form of vitronectin, rΔsBVN, was engineered omitting the first 40 amino acids, so that the mature peptide begins at lysine 41 upon secretion and removal of the signal sequence. These experiments confirm a second PAI-1-binding site within vitronectin that lies outside of the somatomedin B region. Materials—Native vitronectin was purified from human plasma using a modified protocol of the method developed by Dahlback and Podack (36Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Dahlback B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Multimeric vitronectin was prepared by denaturation of the protein in 8 m urea for 2 h at room temperature followed by dialysis into PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). Recombinant human wild-type PAI-1 and recombinant stable PAI-1 mutant, 14-1B (38Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), used in the ELISA assays were both purchased from Molecular Innovations, Inc. PAI-1 used in the Biacore experiments and latency transition assays was produced according to the method outlined in Jensen et al. (28Jensen J.K. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The PAI-1 protein preparations were tested for activity using a urokinase inhibition assay; all behaved similarly and fully inhibited urokinase. The numbering used to denote the amino acid positions in PAI-1 throughout the presented work is Ser1-Ala2-Val3-His4-His5, according to Andreasen et al. (39Andreasen P.A. Riccio A. Welinder K.G. Douglas R. Sartorio R. Nielsen L.S. Oppenheimer C. Blasi F. Dano K. FEBS Lett. 1986; 209: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of analytical reagent grade or better. Cell Culture—Cultures of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) or Trichoplusnia ni (Hi5) cells (Invitrogen) were routinely grown as monolayers in Corning Ti 75-cm2 culture flasks at 27 °C or as suspension cultures in side-arm spinner flasks with gentle stirring at room temperature. Sf9 cells were grown in serum-free Ex-Cell 420 medium, whereas Hi5 cells were grown in Ex-Cell 401 (both from J. R. H. Biosciences) without the addition of serum. Rabbit smooth muscle cells (the kind gift of Dr. Daniel Lawrence, University of Michigan) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. U937 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. U937 cells were stimulated for 24 h with 1 ng/ml human transforming growth factor β-1 (Sigma) and 50 nm 1α25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Calbiochem) (40Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14746-14750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of Recombinant Vitronectin—Both full-length vitronectin and a deletion mutant of vitronectin lacking the first 40 amino acids were expressed in the baculovirus FastBac system (Invitrogen) as in the method described earlier (41Gibson A.D. Peterson C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1545: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both constructs were subcloned into the pFastBac-1 vector (Invitrogen) and utilized the endogenous vitronectin signal sequence to direct protein secretion. The deletion mutant, rΔsBVN, was generated using the following primers: ΔsB sense, 5′-GGCTGTCGACAAGCCCCAAGTGACTCGCGG-3′ and ΔsB antisense, 5′-GGGGCTTGTCGACAGCCAGAGCAACCCATG-3′. The C termini of both recombinant vitronectin and rΔsBVN have an additional 28 amino acids, containing an myc epitope and a 6× histidine tag. The manufacturer's guidelines were followed to transfect the insect cells for virus generation and subsequent protein expression. Both expressed recombinant vitronectin (rVN) and rΔsBVN were secreted into the medium, and clarified spent medium was passed over Chelating Sepharose-Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9) followed by wash buffer (60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9). The bound protein was eluted with elution buffer containing 1 m imidazole. Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting and Coomassie staining. Fractions containing protein were pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated. Protein concentration was determined as described previously (41Gibson A.D. Peterson C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1545: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) by quantitative ELISA and the Pierce BCA Protein Assay. The protein was also subjected to N-terminal protein sequencing, confirming the deletion of the somatomedin B domain as well as cleavage of all but the last amino acid (valine) of the signal sequence. Over the course of these studies, rΔsBVN was expressed from the initial viral stock multiple times. All expressed protein was tested using PAI-1 and heparin binding assays to confirm there was no significant preparation to preparation variability. Heparin Binding Assays—A direct heparin binding assay was used to measure vitronectin binding to heparin-coated microtiter plates as previously described (41Gibson A.D. Peterson C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1545: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, wells were coated with a 1 mg/ml solution of heparin (Sigma) then blocked using 3% casein in PBS. The plates were incubated with serial dilutions of native, multimeric, and recombinant vitronectin. Bound vitronectin was detected using polyclonal antibodies to vitronectin and peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories). Kinetic analysis of the rate of inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin in the presence of heparin and the recombinant proteins was measured by continuously monitoring the cleavage of the chromogenic thrombin substrate Chromozym-TH (Roche Applied Science) over time (42Peterson C.B. Morgan W.T. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7567-7574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin was diluted in reaction buffer (PBS with 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000) to a concentration of 44 nm. A final concentration of 45 nm antithrombin was used in the assay, resulting in 70–80% inhibition of thrombin. Chromozym-TH and heparin (average molecular weight, Mr 6000) were included in the reaction at a final concentration of 0.19 nm and 0.9 μg/ml, respectively. The reactions were monitored at 405 nm for 3 min at 30 °C in 1-ml acrylic cuvettes (Sarstedt). The data were analyzed using the IGOR software package (Wavemetrics) to determine the pseudo-first-order reaction rates. Cell Adhesion Assays—Two different cell lines, from muscular and monocyte origin, were used to assess the effect of deleting the N-terminal of vitronectin on binding to integrins and uPAR. Adherence of rabbit smooth muscle cells to recombinant vitronectin was determined by a method adapted from Stefansson and Lawrence (22Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), who showed this interaction to be primarily integrin-mediated. The wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate were coated overnight at 4 °C with a 10 nm solution of vitronectin or recombinant vitronectin diluted in PBS. After rinsing with PBS, the wells were blocked with 500 μl of a 3.5% solution of BSA in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Rabbit smooth muscle cells were resuspended in serum-free medium containing 1.5% BSA to a concentration of 75,000 cells/well and allowed to adhere for 45 min. Bound cells were quantified by measuring cell surface acid phosphatase. After rinsing the wells to remove any unbound cells, 10 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, was added to the wells. The reaction was stopped after 1 h with the addition of an equal volume of 1 m Tris, pH 9.0, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. A human lymphoma cell line, U937, was also tested for uPAR-mediated adhesion to wild-type vitronectin and rΔsBVN. For the U937 cell binding assay, 140 nm vitronectin or a recombinant vitronectin derivative was added to the wells of a FluoroNunc plate with Maxisorb Surface microtiter plate (Nunc) suitable for fluorescent applications. Wells were blocked with a solution of 3% BSA in PBS. Stimulated U937 cells were fluorescently labeled by uptake of 10 μm calcein AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Cells were washed two times with serum-free RPMI medium and resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/well in serum-free RPMI plus 20 nm uPA (Calbiochem). After an incubation of 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the plate was rinsed with PBS to remove unbound cells. Cell binding was determined by measuring the fluorescence (ex 485/em 535) of the adhered cells in a Wallac Victor2 1420 Multilabel Counter. Integrin Binding Assay—Microtiter plates were coated with 100 μl of a 2.5 μg/ml solution of the integrin GPIIbIIIa in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) according to the protocol described in a previous study (43Minor K.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10337-10345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Wells were blocked with 3.5% BSA in binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Recombinant vitronectin was diluted to 500 nm in binding buffer plus 0.1% Tween and 0.2% BSA and serially diluted down the plate. After incubating for 1 h at 37 °C, the wells were rinsed and anti-vitronectin monoclonal antibody (Quidel, 1:10,000) was added to the wells for 1 h at room temperature. Peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody was added for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were developed using a 0.2 mg/ml solution of 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, containing 12 μl of 30% H2O2. Absorbance was read at 405 nm. All the following ELISA assays were developed and read in the same manner. uPAR Binding Assay—The binding of uPAR to recombinant vitronectin was measured as described by Sidenius et al. (44Sidenius N. Andolfo A. Fesce R. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27982-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The wells of a microtiter plate were coated with multimeric vitronectin and recombinant vitronectin at a concentration of 15 nm in PBS. A 2:1 solution of uPAR (R & D Systems) and uPA (Calbiochem) in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% Tween was mixed and allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Vitronectin-coated wells were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS, and the uPAR:uPA mixture (final concentration per well 60 and 30 nm, respectively) was added to the wells. Following the 1-h incubation, a polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody (Molecular Innovations) was added. The plate was developed as described above. PAI-1 Binding Assays—Competition experiments were used to compare interactions between PAI-1 and native vitronectin or the recombinant vitronectin samples, as described by Seiffert and Loskutoff (25Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. Microtiter plates were coated with a 1 μg/ml solution of native vitronectin in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C then washed. PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 was used for the washes and for protein dilutions. Vitronectin or recombinant vitronectin was serially diluted on the plate following blocking. A constant concentration of either wild-type or stable PAI-1 (0.4 nm) was added to the wells, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The amount of PAI-1 that bound to the immobilized vitronectin was detected using polyclonal anti-PAI-1 antibodies. Analysis of PAI-1 Binding to rΔsBVN by Surface Plasmon Resonance—All SPR experiments were performed on a BIACORE 3000™ instrument. Recombinant ΔsBVN was coupled directly to the surface of a CM5™ chip by standard amine coupling protocol by applying a 30 μg/ml vitronectin, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, until a density of 600 response units accumulated on the chip. Ethanolamine blocked empty flow cells were used as a reference. When necessary, regeneration of the flow cells between runs was achieved by injecting pulses of 10 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.0, and/or 0.05% SDS in running buffer until baseline levels were acquired. To determine the binding affinity for PAI-1 binding to rΔsBVN, 120-μl samples of active PAI-1 diluted in running buffer were injected in an array of concentrations from 0.25 to 1500 nm at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was calculated according to the method outlined by Rich and Myszka (45Rich R.L"
https://openalex.org/W2050126694,"Vertebrate myosin Va is a dimeric processive motor that walks on actin filaments to deliver cargo. In contrast, the two class V myosins in budding yeast, Myo2p and Myo4p, are non-processive (Reck-Peterson, S. L., Tyska, M. J., Novick, P. J., and Mooseker, M. S. (2001) J. Cell Biol. 153, 1121–1126). We previously showed that a chimera with the motor domain of Myo4p on the backbone of vertebrate myosin Va was processive, demonstrating that the Myo4p motor domain has a high duty ratio. Here we examine the properties of a chimera containing the rod and globular tail of Myo4p joined to the motor domain and neck of mouse myosin Va. Surprisingly, the adaptor protein She3p binds to the rod region of Myo4p and forms a homogeneous single-headed myosin-She3p complex, based on sedimentation equilibrium and velocity data. We propose that She3p forms a heterocoiled-coil with Myo4p and is a subunit of the motor. She3p does not affect the maximal actin-activated ATPase in solution or the velocity of movement in an ensemble in vitro motility assay. At the single molecule level, the monomeric myosin-She3p complex showed no processivity. When this construct was dimerized with a leucine zipper, short processive runs were obtained. Robust continuous movement was observed when multiple monomeric myosin-She3p motors were bound to a quantum dot “cargo.” We propose that continuous transport of mRNA by Myo4p-She3p in yeast is accomplished either by multiple high duty cycle monomers or by molecules that may be dimerized by She2p, the homodimeric downstream binding partner of She3p.

It is well established that vertebrate myosin Va is a highly processive motor protein that can move for several μm without dissociating from its actin track (reviewed in Ref. 1Sellers J.R. Veigel C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Efficient processivity requires several features, including a high duty cycle motor domain (2Moore J.R.

The wealth of data on vertebrate myosin Va led one to believe that processivity was a property common to all class V myosins. This assumption was challenged with the observation that neither of the two class V myosins from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, perversely called Myo2p and Myo4p, are processive motors (7Reck-Peterson S.L.

Myo2p has a number of cargoes, including vacuoles, late Golgi, peroxisomes, and secretory vesicles, the last of which is its essential cargo (reviewed in Ref. 10Weisman L.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Myo4p transports over 20 different mRNAs (11Jambhekar A. McDermott K. Sorber K. Shepard K.A. Vale R.D. Takizawa P.A. DeRisi J.L.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to the bud on actin cables. One of the best studied cargoes of Myo4p is ASH1 mRNA, which preferentially accumulates in the daughter cell and prevents it from switching mating type (15Long R.M. Singer R.H. Meng X. Gonzalez I. Nasmyth K. Jansen R.P. Science. 1997; 277: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 16Jansen R.P. Dowzer C. Michaelis C. Galova M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1996; 84: 687-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Three of the proteins required for proper localization of ASH1 mRNA are Myo4p (also known as She1p), She2p, and She3p. She3p acts as an adaptor between the motor and She2p, which binds the mRNA cargo (reviewed in Ref. 17Gonsalvez G.B. Urbinati C.R. Long R.M. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Our goal is to understand the molecular basis for the lack of yeast Myo4p processivity. Myo4p was reported to be nonprocessive, because it had a low to intermediate duty ratio (7Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas a processive dimer requires that each head have a duty ratio of >50%. We engineered a chimera that contained the Myo4p motor domain on the neck and rod of mouse myosin Va, with the expectation that it would be nonprocessive. Surprisingly, this chimera showed even longer processive run lengths than wild type mouse myosin Va at low ionic strength (18Krementsova E.B. Hodges A.R. Lu H. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6079-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This result established that the Myo4p motor domain has a high duty cycle and the potential to support processive motion. Based on this result, we proposed that the poor α-helical coiled-coil propensity of the Myo4p rod allows it to exist as a nonprocessive monomer (18Krementsova E.B. Hodges A.R. Lu H. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6079-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The propensity to form α-helical coiled-coil is based on the strength of the heptad repeat, a seven-amino acid motif in which the first and fourth positions, which form the internal seam of the coiled-coil, are hydrophobic amino acids. The rod of dimeric mouse myosin Va has a total of ∼60 heptad repeats of coiled-coil, and the first ∼20 heptad repeats before the PEST site are sufficient to ensure dimerization (Fig. 1a). In contrast, the Myo4p rod has a total of about five heptads of potential α-helical coiled-coil, which may be insufficient to support dimerization (Fig. 1a) (19Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Here we test this hypothesis by analyzing the properties of a chimera containing the motor domain and neck of mouse myosin Va, a known processive motor, joined to the rod and globular tail of Myo4p.The results show that the Myo4p rod has little tendency to associate with itself and form a dimer, an observation not made with any other class V myosin to date. The coiled-coil region of the Myo4p rod instead prefers to interact with its binding partner, She3p, probably forming a heterocoiled-coil. The myosin-She3p complex forms a homogeneous single-headed motor. She3p is thus not a typical binding partner but an intrinsic part of the Myo4p molecule. Processive runs were only observed if the myosin-She3p complex was dimerized with a leucine zipper, creating a two-headed motor, or when multiple motors were bound to the Qdot “cargo.” In the yeast cell, mRNA transport may be driven by multiple monomeric motors. Alternatively, we speculate that Myo4p may be dimerized to form a processive motor by She2p, the homodimeric downstream binding partner of She3p (20Niessing D. Huttelmaier S. Zenklusen D. Singer R.H. Burley S.K. Cell. 2004; 119: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMyosin V Constructs—Four chimeras were engineered, each of which contains the motor domain and neck of mouse myosin Va (amino acids Met1–Lys908; accession number NP034994). This head was joined to four variations of the rod and globular tail of Myo4p from S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1b). All constructs, including the mouse myosin V HMM control, contained a C-terminal FLAG tag to facilitate purification and a biotin tag at the N terminus for attachment to streptavidin quantum dots (Qdots) (Invitrogen), as described in Ref. 21Hodges A.R. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27192-27197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar. The full-length constructs contained amino acids Glu928 to Lys1471 from Myo4p (accession number AAO32405), and the ΔGT constructs contained amino acids Glu928–Gln1026 of Myo4p. The joining sequence between the end of mouse myosin V and the beginning of the Myo4p rod is RELKKLKERNIRAS, with Myo4p amino acid sequence shown in italic type. For the full-length-Zip and ΔGT-Zip chimeras, a leucine zipper was added after the predicted coiled-coil region of the Myo4p rod, following amino acid Leu1024. For the ΔGT-Zip chimera, this was followed by a FLAG tag. For the full-length-Zip chimera, the leucine zipper was followed by the remainder of the Myo4p sequence, from amino acid Ile1025 to Lys1471, and then by a FLAG-tag. The plasmid pYC352-MYO4 (kindly provided by Brian Haarer and Karen Beningo) was used as the PCR template for these constructs. SHE3 with a C-terminal His tag was cloned into the baculovirus vector pAcSG2. The SHE3 gene was amplified by PCR from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and verified to be the coding sequence found at the Saccharomyces genome data base.Protein Expression and Purification—Myosin constructs were expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system and purified on a FLAG affinity column as described previously (18Krementsova E.B. Hodges A.R. Lu H. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6079-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The myosin constructs were co-expressed with calmodulinΔall (CaMΔall), a mutant lacking all calcium binding sites (22Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For one experiment that tested the effect of calcium binding on activity, the heavy chain was co-expressed with wild-type calmodulin. CaMΔall was also expressed in bacteria (22Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In order to ensure that all IQ motifs were occupied, 3.0 μm excess CaMΔall was added to the cell lysate during purification, and 6.0 μm CaMΔall was added to the final buffer for all assays except analytical ultracentrifugation. Where indicated, virus encoding for She3p was also included in the co-infection. Chicken skeletal actin was prepared from acetone powder (23Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar).Analytical Ultracentrifuge—An Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) was used to determine the sedimentation coefficients of the expressed constructs. Sedimentation velocity runs were performed in the An60Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm and 20 °C, in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 3The abbreviations used are:DTTdithiothreitolTIRFtotal internal reflection fluorescence. 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, and ∼2 μm myosin. Sedimentation values were corrected for density and viscosity of the solvent. Sedimentation coefficients were determined by curve fitting to one or more species, using the dc/dt program (24Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium data were collected at 6,000 rpm and 4 °C, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, and ∼1.5–4 μm myosin. The data were analyzed with Origin software provided with the Beckman Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge. For molecular weight calculations, the fit to the average of three independent scans at equilibrium was determined for each protein sample, and the average and S.D. of those values was calculated for each construct.Steady-state Actin-activated ATPase Assay—NADH-linked actin-activated ATPase assays were performed at 30 °C, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3, 50–100 nm myosin, and 6.0 μm CaMΔall as previously described (18Krementsova E.B. Hodges A.R. Lu H. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6079-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).In Vitro Motility—The myosin V constructs (0.1 mg/ml) were mixed with a 2-fold molar excess of F-actin and 1 mm MgATP in a high salt buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 0.3 m KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm DTT) and centrifuged for 20 min at 400,000 × g to remove myosin that was unable to dissociate from actin in the presence of ATP. The concentration after the spin was measured by the Bradford Protein Assay. The myosin was then diluted into the same buffer used for centrifugation and adsorbed directly to nitrocellulose-coated coverslips that were preincubated with 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 s. Rhodamine-phalloidin labeled actin filaments were passed through a 21½ gauge needle to fragment them to ∼1 μm in length. The motility assay was performed at 30 °C in Motility Buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm DTT), that also contained 6.0 μm CaMΔall, an oxygen-scavenging system (3 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.18 mg/ml catalase), and an ATP-regenerating system (0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 100 units/ml pyruvate kinase).Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy—Single molecule motility assays using TIRF microscopy were performed as described previously (21Hodges A.R. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27192-27197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Baker J.E. Krementsova E.B. Kennedy G.G. Armstrong A. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5542-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For single molecule experiments, the myosin V constructs were diluted to 0.2 μm (concentration of heads) and mixed with a 10-fold molar excess of 655-nm streptavidin-coated quantum dots (Invitrogen) to ensure single motor transport. Because the constructs were labeled with a biotin tag at the N terminus of the motor domain, it is unlikely that multiple motors could simultaneously transport a single quantum dot. For multiple motor experiments, the full-length chimeras were diluted to 0.2 μm and mixed with 655-nm carboxylated quantum dots (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 4 or 8 heads per quantum dot. Rhodamine-phalloidin labeled actin was attached to a glass flow cell using N-ethylmaleimide-modified skeletal muscle myosin, which forms a strong and ATP-insensitive bond with actin. The Qdot-labeled myosin was then diluted to between 0.25 and 2 nm in Motility Buffer (see above) with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6.0 μm CaMΔall, an oxygen-scavenging system, and an ATP-regenerating system and added to the flow cell. Through-the-objective TIRF microscopy was performed at 30 °C. The final pixel resolution was 55 nm, and data were collected at 4–12 frames/s.Myosin movement along fluorescently labeled actin filaments was tracked by hand, using the program ImageJ. For each event, we required the quantum dot-labeled construct to move continuously for at least 4 frames in order to qualify as a run. The characteristic run length λ was determined by nonlinear least squares fitting of the equation P(x) = Ae-x/λ to the run length distribution, where P(x) represents the probability of the myosin traveling a distance x along an actin filament, and A is a constant.RESULTSExpressed Constructs—Two chimeric constructs were expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system to test if the rod region of Myo4p can dimerize with itself by forming a coiled-coil (Fig. 1b). The first, called full-length chimera, contained the rod and globular tail (GT) of yeast Myo4p, joined to the motor domain and neck of mouse myosin Va. The second, called the ΔGT chimera, lacked the globular tail and contained only the rod of Myo4p. An additional version of each construct was engineered by the addition of a leucine zipper after the Myo4p rod, thus ensuring that these two constructs are dimeric, two-headed motors. The leucine zipper is an ∼30-amino acid sequence that forms a particularly stable α-helical coiled-coil, primarily due to the presence of Leu residues at the fourth position of each heptad repeat. SDS-gels of the purified proteins are shown in Fig. 2. All of the chimeric constructs expressed well in the baculovirus/insect cell expression system, whereas intact native Myo4p could only be expressed in low yield, precluding its detailed characterization at present. Because all IQ motifs are not equal, we chose to retain the mouse IQ motifs in the chimeras. This allowed mammalian CaM to abut the motor domain instead of yeast CaM, which is only 58% identical to the mammalian isoform. The Myo4p IQ motifs bind only yeast CaM, and we did not want to perturb the known processive nature of the myosin Va motor. This strategy allows us to assess only the effect of the Myo4p rod on a known processive motor.FIGURE 2She3p co-purifies with the full-length and ΔGT chimeras. SDS-PAGE of the full-length, ΔGT, and mouse myosin V constructs after purification on a FLAG affinity column. Each construct was co-expressed with or without She3p to test for binding, and all constructs were co-expressed with calmodulin. Lane 1, molecular weight markers; lanes 2 and 3, the full-length chimera co-expressed with She3p or in its absence. Lanes 4 and 5, the ΔGT chimera co-expressed with She3p or in its absence. Lane 6, mouse myosin Va HMM co-expressed with She3p. She3p co-purifies with the full-length and ΔGT chimeras in a 1:1 molar ratio with the heavy chain but does not co-purify with mouse myosin V.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dimerization Properties of the Myo4p Rod—The full-length chimera showed a marked tendency to aggregate when analyzed by sedimentation velocity (Fig. 3a). Three-fourths of the total protein formed large aggregates that rapidly sedimented; the remainder of the protein could be fit to a homogeneous species that sedimented at ∼7 S (Table 1). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on protein from which the aggregates were removed, either by gel filtration or by clarification at high speed. The values were more similar to a monomer than a dimer (Table 1), showing that this construct forms a range of species from monomers to higher oligomers.FIGURE 3Sedimentation velocity of the full-length and ΔGT chimeras. a–c, absorbance as a function of distance and time for the full-length chimera (a), the full-length-She3p complex (b), and the ΔGT chimera (c). Each trace represents the absorbance profile at one point in time. Multiple traces at subsequent intervals are overlaid. The rapid decrease and heterogeneous shape of the absorbance profiles for the full-length construct shows that multiple species of oligomers are formed, which sediment rapidly.

The molecular weight of this species, determined by sedimentation equilibrium, was that of a dimer (Table 1). The dimer sedimented at 8.8 S, consistent with a higher molecular weight and increased asymmetry compared with the ∼7 S full-length monomer. In the absence of the globular tail, the coiled-coil region of the rod can therefore dimerize with itself at protein concentrations greater than 1 μm. Only the construct lacking the globular tail formed a homogeneous dimer, implying that the globular tail may have the potential to interact with the coiled-coil-forming region, inhibiting dimerization by a mechanism similar to that suggested for myosin VI (26Park H.

She3p co-purified with both constructs when isolated from Sf9 cell lysates on a FLAG affinity column (Fig. 2). By gel densitometry, 0.98 ± 0.04 mol of She3p bound per mol of heavy chain of the ΔGT construct (supplemental Fig. S1). These results localize the primary binding site of She3p to the rod region of Myo4p and establish that the binding of She3p to the Myo4p is tight, as indicated by its co-purification from a dilute (∼0.2 μm) lysate. It was recently shown that Myo4p purified from yeast also has She3p bound, in agreement with our observations (27Dunn B.D. Sakamoto T. Hong M.S. Sellers J.R. Takizawa P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). She3p did not co-purify with mouse myosin V HMM (Fig. 2, lane 6), which rules out the possibility that She3p binds to the head or neck of the chimeras.The presence of She3p caused a striking change in the sedimentation velocity profile of the full-length chimera (Fig. 3b). The large aggregates were essentially abolished, and the predominant species sedimented at the same value as the minor species in the absence of She3p (Table 1). Importantly, the molecular weights obtained with the full-length-She3p complex were consistent with a species consisting of one molecule of each of the two proteins, to create a homogeneous, heterodimeric single-headed motor (Fig. 4a and Table 1). This result implies that the Myo4p rod prefers to interact with a molecule of She3p rather than a second Myo4p rod.FIGURE 4Molecular weight determination by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. Shown are the molecular weight of the full-length-She3p complex (a) and the ΔGT-She3p complex (b). The molecular weights are consistent with both the full-length and ΔGT chimeras forming a single-headed motor species consisting of one heavy chain bound to one molecule of She3p. Each panel shows a representative data set at equilibrium and the fit to the data with residuals. Molecular weight data for these and other constructs are summarized in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With the ΔGT chimera, She3p again caused the formation of a single-headed motor species in complex with one molecule of She3p, as determined from sedimentation equilibrium data (Fig. 4b and Table 1). She3p had little effect on aggregation of the ΔGT chimera, which in its absence was already fairly homogeneous. The ΔGT-She3p complex sedimented at 6.4 S (Table 1), compared with 8.8 S in the absence of She3p, consistent with its lower molecular weight as a complex of one heavy chain and one molecule of She3p, versus two heavy chains. Because She3p abolished the dimerization seen with ΔGT alone, the Myo4p rod has a higher affinity for She3p than it does for a second Myo4p rod. This is the first example of a heterologous protein causing a myosin motor to exist as a single-headed species.She3p Does Not Affect Actin-activated ATPase Activity or Ensemble Motility—The actin-activated ATPase activity of the two constructs was determined in the presence or absence of She3p. Despite the ability of She3p to form a single-headed motor complex, it had very little effect on the activity of either the full-length or the ΔGT chimera (Fig. 5a and Table 2). The maximal activity of the ΔGT chimera was ∼3 times greater than that of the full-length chimera, independent of She3p. An enhancement of activity with a truncated construct generally suggests that a regulatory element has been deleted. In mouse myosin Va, the addition of calcium opens the molecule from its compact, inhibited form to its unfolded, active form, increasing the ATPase rate (22Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the addition of calcium did not increase the activity of the full-length chimera expressed with wild-type calmodulin (data not shown). Nonetheless, the full-length chimera does not express the full activity that the mouse motor domain is capable of, implying that some inhibitory interaction involves the globular tail.FIGURE 5She3p does not affect the activity of the full-length or ΔGT chimeras. a, actin-activated ATPase for the full-length (FL) construct (○), the full-length-She3p complex (•), the ΔGT construct (▵), and the ΔGT-She3p complex (▴).

https://openalex.org/W2046905215,"When females can reproduce without males, do males become an evolutionarily weaker sex whose genes experience mutational decay? We addressed this hypothesis in aphids, whose reproduction alternates between parthenogenetic and sexual forms: Over the course of a year, there can be 10 to 20 generations of asexual females but only a single, if any, generation with males. We used microarray analyses to identify male-biased, asexual female‐biased, and neutral genes. Interspecific comparisons reveal accelerated evolution of male-biased genes, and intraspecific polymorphisms exhibit a significant excess of nonsynonymous coding variation in male-biased genes. We conclude that the ability of females to reproduce asexually without males reduces selection constraints on male-based genes, resulting in their mutational decay."

The peroxin Pex3p is a peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP), involved in peroxisomal membrane biogenesis. It acts as a docking receptor for another peroxin Pex19p, which is a specific carrier protein for newly synthesized PMPs. Here we have determined the physicochemical properties and binding manners of Pex3p-Pex19p interaction, in terms of the affinity, the stoichiometry, and the binding site in Pex3p. The cytosolic domain of human Pex3p was overproduced, using an Escherichia coli expression system and was highly purified by two chromatography steps. Gel filtration chromatography analyses and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence titrations revealed that a one-to-one complex is formed between monomeric Pex3p and monomeric Pex19p. The tryptophan fluorescence spectrum of Pex3p showed a large 18-nm blue shift of the maximum emission wavelength by the binding of Pex19p. This result indicates that either one or two tryptophan residues of Pex3p (Trp-104 and Trp-224) are directly involved in binding to Pex19p. We investigated the binding activities of the wild-type and tryptophan mutants of Pex3p by pull-down assays and surface plasmon resonance analyses. As a result, the wild-type and the W104A and W104F mutants showed KD values of 3.4 nm, 1080 nm, and 66.2 nm, respectively. The affinity differences with mutation affected their peroxisome restoring activities in pex3 ZPG208 cells.

Peroxisomes are single membrane-bound organelles in a wide variety of eukaryotic cells.

Peroxisome biogenesis requires multiple “peroxin” proteins encoded by PEX genes. Most of the peroxin defects cause mislocalization of peroxisomal matrix proteins, and generate peroxisomal membrane ghosts, lacking their internal contents (4Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev.

These studies revealed that the interaction between Pex3p and Pex19p is important for the biogenesis of peroxisomal membranes, and suggested the functional regions of these proteins. However, no common recognition sites of Pex3p for Pex19p have been found. Most of the experiments were performed by the induction of a short fragment of the objective Pex3p gene, although it is uncertain whether the truncated gene product maintains the authentic three-dimensional structure. Actually, it was suggested that the Pex3p-Pex19p interaction requires nearly full-length Pex3p (7Ghaedi K. Tamura S. Okumoto K. Matsuzono Y. Fujiki Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2085-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To evaluate the important residues of Pex3p for Pex19p binding, highly purified protein samples are preferable, and the physicochemical properties of the interaction should be quantitatively analyzed while considering protein structures. However, no such experimental data have been reported for Pex3p. Here, we have characterized the binding properties of the Pex3p-Pex19p interaction, using highly purified human Pex3p. As for the molecular mechanisms of Pex3p-Pex19p interactions, an important question is how Pex3p specifically chooses Pex19p as a binding partner from the many different proteins in the cytosol. To address this question, we have analyzed the physicochemical properties and the binding of the Pex3p-Pex19p interaction with regard to affinity, stoichiometry, and binding site in Pex3p using fluorescence measurements and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses. We have concluded that Trp-104 in Pex3p is a critical amino acid residue for binding. Materials—Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Hokkaido System Sciences Co.

Expression Plasmids—To construct the expression plasmid for the His10 cytosolic domain of Pex3p (region from Gln-34 to its C-terminal end, Lys-373); pET16b/PEX3(amino acids 34–373), PCR was carried out, with the forward primer 5′-CATATGCAGAAGAAAATCAGAGAAATACAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AGATCTCATTTCTCCAGTTGCTGAGG-3′, to introduce an NdeI site at the N terminus and a BglII site at the C terminus, respectively. The PCR product was ligated with the pT7Blue T-Vector, and the DNA sequence of the insert was confirmed, using an ABI PRISM 310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The plasmid was then digested with NdeI and BglII, and the fragment containing the PEX3(amino acids 34–373) gene was inserted into pET-16b, at the NdeI/BamHI restriction sites. The expression plasmid for glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Pex3p-(34–373) was constructed using essentially similar procedures to those described above.

The transformants were grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.7–1.0, and then were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 18–20 h at 18 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets from 1-liter cultures were resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A, containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and were disrupted by sonication (7 min, 30 s on and 30 s off, output 5 and 50% duty cycle) on ice with a Branson Sonifier 250 (Branson Ultrasonics). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 10-ml column of Ni2+-NTA-agarose equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol. His10-Pex3p-(34–373) was eluted stepwise with 0.25 m imidazole. The fractions containing His10-Pex3p-(34–373) were concentrated with a Vivaspin concentrator (cut off: 10 kDa, Sartorius) and were further purified by gel filtration chromatography, using a Superdex200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) with a running buffer of 20 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. For the Pex3p-(34–373) mutants, W104A, W224A, and W104F were expressed and purified by the same method. K100A, I103A, L107A, K108A, and F112A were expressed and purified by one-step affinity chromatography with the Ni2+-NTA agarose, as described above. Hereafter, His10-Pex3p-(34–373) is referred to as Pex3p. His10-Pex19p and GST-Pex19p were prepared as described (13Shibata H. Kashiwayama Y. Imanaka T. Kato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38486-38494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), with some modifications. In the purification of His10-Pex19p, we used buffers without dithiothreitol. His10-Pex19p W202F was also purified by the same method. To obtain Pex19p without tag, the glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) eluate of GST-Pex19p was digested with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After removing glutathione in the eluate by dialyses, the protease and GST tag were removed by passing through the glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. The flow-through fractions were further purified by an anion exchange chromatography as described (13Shibata H. Kashiwayama Y. Imanaka T. Kato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38486-38494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Measurement of Protein Concentrations—Protein concentrations were measured by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The A0.1% at 280-nm values we used were calculated from the amino acid composition (23Gill S.C. Hippel von P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). The A0.1% at 280-nm values are as follows: 0.56 for the wild-type Pex3p and the Pex3p mutants without tryptophan replacement, 0.43 for the Pex3p W104A and W224A mutants, and 0.28 for His10-Pex19p and 0.89 for GST-Pex19p. The concentration of the tryptophan-less Pex19p mutant, which has little absorbance at 280 nm, was measured by the Bradford method (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211906) Google Scholar). The standard curve was calibrated with the wild-type Pex19p, for which the concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar). Samples containing Pex3p were loaded without heating. Proteins separated in the polyacrylamide gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-350 (GE Healthcare). For the Western blotting analyses, rabbit anti-human His10-Pex3p polyclonal antibodies and rabbit anti-human His10-Pex19p polyclonal antibodies were obtained from the antibody production service by Qiagen. The goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-AP conjugate (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody. The color development was carried out by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate and 4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride. Gel Filtration Chromatography Analysis of Pex3p, Pex19p, and Their Complex—Gel filtration chromatography analyses were performed on a Superdex200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. The running buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol, and the flow rate was 0.6 ml/min. Each sample (200 μl), containing Pex3p at 10 μm, Pex19p at 10 μm, or a mixture of them at 10 μm, was loaded, and the elution profiles were monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm. The column was calibrated with using a gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad) containing thyroglobulin, 670 kDa; γ-globulin, 158 kDa; ovalbumin, 44 kDa; myoglobin, 17 kDa and vitamin B12, 1.35 kDa. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurement—Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed using a Shimadzu RF-5300PC spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu). Samples containing 0.5 μm Pex3p and 0.125–2.0 μm Pex19p (20 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol) were prepared. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra derived from Pex3p (Trp-104 and Trp-224) were measured at 25 °C. In this experiment, the Pex19p W202F was used to avoid the influences induced by the original tryptophan residue of Pex19p. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, and the emission spectra were measured between 300 and 450 nm. The excitation slit width was 3 nm and the emission slit width was 10 nm. The emission spectra were corrected by subtracting the spectra of each concentration of the Pex19p W202F in the same buffer. Pull-down Assay—Pull-down assays for the binding between Pex3p and Pex19p were performed as described below. 10 μlof glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with 125 μlof GST-Pex19p at 0.3 mg/ml in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-Na pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl and 10% glycerol) for 10 min at 4 °C. After the incubation, the beads were washed two times with 125 μlof the binding buffer, and then a 100-μl aliquot of Pex3p or its mutants at 0.2 mg/ml was added. 10 μl of the suspension were collected as input samples. The remaining suspensions were diluted with 1 ml of the binding buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of the binding buffer and were resuspended in 100 μl of the binding buffer (samples: bound). Proteins in the samples “Input” and “Bound” were eluted in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As for the binding between Pex3p and Pex19p-PMP22 complex, the binding assays were performed essentially in the same procedures as described (13Shibata H. Kashiwayama Y. Imanaka T. Kato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38486-38494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, His10-PMP22 mRNA was translated with the cell-free protein synthesis system in the presence of 24 μg of Pex19p, which did not have a tag region. After the 20-h translation at 26 °C, the reaction mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000 × g. Then, 32 μg of the wild-type GST-Pex3p or the GST-Pex3p W104A mutant was added to the supernatant and incubated for 5 min on ice. The reaction mixtures were purified by chromatography on 100-μlNi2+-NTA-agarose columns, using the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole for washing, or 200 mm for elution. Each eluate was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitates were analyzed by the Western blotting. In this study, each 1:2000 dilution mixture of anti-Pex3p, anti-Pex19p, and anti-PMP22 antibodies was used as the primary antibody. We confirmed that these three antibodies did not cross-react with each other in advance. Circular Dichroism (CD) Analysis—CD spectra were measured with a JASCO J-725 spectrometer (Jasco International Co., Ltd.). Samples were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. A quartz cell with a 1-mm light pathlength was used. All measurements were performed at 20 °C. Data were collected as the average of 16 time measurements. SPR Analysis—Equilibrium binding analyses of the interaction between Pex3p and Pex19p were performed with a Biacore2000 instrument (GE Healthcare). Goat anti-GST antibodies (GE Healthcare) were immobilized on CM5 sensor chips (GE Healthcare) in two flow cells by standard amine coupling, following the manufacturer's instructions. Then, purified GST-Pex19p was captured on flow cell 2 via the GST antibody, while flow cell 1 was used as a reference. All experiments were performed at 25 °C, using buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20 (running buffer). Various concentrations of Pex3p and its mutants were injected. All samples to be injected were dialyzed against the running buffer to reduce the bulk refractive index changes caused by buffer variations. Association and dissociation phases were both monitored for 3–5 min. After each cycle, the surfaces were regenerated by injections of 10 mm glycine-Cl, pH 2.2, for 1 min and 50 mm NaOH for 1 min. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was obtained by non-linear fitting to a one-site model of the Langmuir binding isotherm (see Equation 1). Curve fitting was performed using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software Co.).

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). DNA transfection to Chinese hamster ovary cells was performed by lipofection (8Matsuzono Y. Kinoshita N. Tamura S.

At 60-h post-transfection, peroxisomes in cells were detected by indirect immunofluorescence light microscopy as described (20Matsuzono Y. Matsuzaki T. Fujiki Y. J.

Expression and Purification of His10-Pex3p-(34–373)—To investigate the molecular properties of the human Pex3p protein, we prepared highly purified Pex3p lacking the N-terminal 33-residue hydrophobic segment (Pex3p-(34–373)). The purification of His10-Pex3p-(34–373) is summarized in Fig. 1. Even though the hydrophobic segment was removed, Pex3p was prone to aggregate formation. We found that a low temperature and a high salt concentration were required to improve its solubility. For example, during the dialysis of His10-Pex3p-(34–373) at 0.6 mg/ml in a high salt buffer (10 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol) against a buffer without salt (10 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol), the protein formed precipitates and finally achieved a 0.1 mg/ml concentration in a 20,000 × g supernatant of the dialyzed solution. Determination of the Molecular Weights of Pex3p and the Pex3p-Pex19p Complex—We analyzed the molecular weights of Pex3p and the Pex3p-Pex19p complex by gel filtration chromatography analyses. Purified Pex3p (theoretical molecular mass: 40.9 kDa) was eluted in a sharp peak at the retention volume of 15.5 ml (Fig. 2). This location corresponds to an apparent molecular mass of 39.6 kDa, which is close to the monomeric size. Purified Pex19p (theoretical molecular mass: 36.1 kDa) and the mixture of equivalent molar amounts of Pex3p and Pex19p were each eluted, respectively, in sharp peaks at the retention volumes of 13.8 ml and 13.2 ml (Fig. 2). These locations correspond to apparent molecular masses of 97.2 and 135.2 kDa. Pex19p is suggested to exist as a monomer, as determined by an analytical ultracentrifugation experiment (supplemental Fig. S2). In gel filtration chromatography, the retention volume of Pex19p corresponds to a larger molecular weight than its theoretical one because of its extended conformation. The apparent molecular mass of 135.2 kDa is nearly equal to 136.8 kDa, the sum of the molecular masses of Pex3p and Pex19p, suggesting that they form a complex in a 1:1 molar ratio. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Titration of Pex3p with Pex19p—To investigate the binding manner between Pex3p and Pex19p, we measured the tryptophan fluorescence changes of Pex3p induced by the binding of Pex19p. Pex3p has two tryptophan residues (Trp-104 and Trp-224) and Pex19p has one tryptophan residue (Trp-202). In this experiment, the Pex19p W202F mutant was used as an alternative to that of the wild-type, to avoid the influences induced by the original tryptophan residue of Pex19p. This mutation seems not to have essential effects on the binding to Pex3p because the Trp-202 locates in the region, which was suggested not to participate in the binding to Pex3p (13Shibata H. Kashiwayama Y. Imanaka T. Kato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38486-38494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, we confirmed that the binding affinity of the Pex19p W202F mutant toward Pex3p was the sa"

Here, we showed that this kinase was very susceptible to oxidative modulation. Treatment of mouse brain synaptosomes with H2O2, diamide, and sodium nitroprusside caused aggregation of CaMKII through formation of disulfide and non-disulfide linkages, and partial inhibition of the kinase activity. These CaMKII aggregates were found to associate with the post synaptic density. However, treatment of purified CaMKII with these oxidants did not replicate those effects observed in the synaptosomes. Using two previously identified potential mediators of oxidants in the brain, glutathione disulfide S-monoxide (GS-DSMO) and glutathione disulfide S-dioxide (GS-DSDO), we showed that they oxidized and inhibited CaMKII in a manner partly related to those of the oxidant-treated synaptosomes as well as the ischemia-elicited oxidative stress in the acutely prepared hippocampal slices. Interestingly, the autophosphorylated and activated CaMKII was relatively refractory to GS-DSMO- and GS-DSDO-mediated aggregation. Short term ischemia (10 min) caused a depression of basal synaptic response of the hippocampal slices, and re-oxygenation (after 10 min) reversed the depression. However, oxidation of CaMKII remained at above the pre-ischemic level throughout the treatment. Oxidation of CaMKII also prevented full recovery of CaMKII autophosphorylation after re-oxygenation. Subsequently, the high frequency stimulation-mediated synaptic potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region was significantly reduced compared with the control without ischemia. Thus, ischemia-evoked oxidation of CaMKII, probably via the action of glutathione disulfide S-oxides or their analogues, may be involved in the suppression of synaptic plasticity.

In the central nervous system, CaMKII plays a pivotal role in the facilitation of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory and in activity-dependent developmental processes (1Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). CaMKII holoenzyme is a dodecamer composed of two stacked hexameric rings, in which each catalytic/regulatory domain from the upper ring interacts with the equivalent catalytic/regulatory domain in the lower ring by an antiparallel coiled-coil, which resides in regulatory domains (2Rosenberg O.S. Deindl S. Sung R.J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2005; 123: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+/CaM to the regulatory domain separates the dimer pair and causes the exposure of Thr-286 or Thr-287 (within α or β subunit) for phosphorylation by another catalytic domain in the same ring. This inter-subunit phosphorylation of Thr-286/287 converts the kinase into a high affinity binding protein for Ca2+/CaM, and the kinase becomes an activator-independent autonomous enzyme (3Rich R.C. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28424-28429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation also leads to increased affinity of the kinase for several proteins near the sites of elevated Ca2+ with functional consequences (4Merrill M.A. Chen Y. Strack S. Hell J.W.

The activity-dependent translocation of CaMKII from dendritic cytoplasm to the stimulated synapses may serve as a tag for long term strengthening of synaptic connection (14Frey U. Morris R.G.

Stimulation of NMDA receptors by excitatory amino acids increases postsynaptic Ca2+ influx, which facilitates the activation and autophosphorylation of CaMKII and its interaction with the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors and other proteins associated with the postsynaptic density (16Bayer K.U.

During ischemic stress and seizure-induced neuronal excitation, clustering and inactivation of CaMKII within soma and neuronal processes have been proposed as a neuroprotective mechanism, which would limit excessive kinase activity during episodes of Ca2+-overload (7Tao-Cheng J.H. Vinade L. Winters C.A. Reese T.S. Dosemeci A. Neuroscience. 2005; 130: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). CaMKII holoenzyme has been shown to be capable of forming higher order complexes by self-association in the presence of Ca2+/CaM and slightly acidic pH (19Hudmon A. Kim S.A. Kolb S.J. Stoops J.K. Waxham M.N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1364-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using live-cell imaging, Hudmon et al. (20Hudmon A. Lebel E. Roy H. Sik A. Schulman H. Waxham M.N. De Koninck P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6971-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) showed that stimulation of glutamate receptors induced translocation of green fluorescent protein-CaMKII holoenzyme to synaptic and non-synaptic sites. Although stimulation of NMDA receptors causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and a slight acidification of cellular cytoplasm (21Hartley Z. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4690-4699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Irwin R.P. Lin S.Z. Long R.T. Paul S.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a condition conducive for self-association, it also increases production of reactive oxygen species, such as nitric oxide (23Chetkovich D.M. Klann E. Sweatt J.D. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 919-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and superoxide (24Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Especially during ischemic and excitotoxic stress, a sustained elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and energy depletion causes uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation that generates a high level of these reactive oxygen species from neurons as well as from glia cells (25Moncada S. Bolanos J.P. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1676-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 26Halestrap A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that these reactive oxygen species could modulate CaMKII activity by direct oxidation of this protein, which constitutes 1–2% of total brain protein (27Erondu N.E. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as by oxidation of its activator, CaM (28Robison A.J. Winder D.G. Colbran R.J. Bartlett R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 356: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that activation of NMDA receptors or direct administration of oxidants to the brain slices could trigger thionylation of neurogranin and formation of intra-molecular disulfide of this protein (29Li J. Huang F.L. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3098-3105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Wu J. Huang K.P. Huang F.L. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1524-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The oxidant-induced modification of protein was hypothesized as a result of oxidation by the endogenously produced glutathione disulfide S-oxides (GS-DSOs), which have a high activity to form glutathione-protein-mixed disulfide (glutathionylation) and inter- and/or intra-molecular disulfide bonds of proteins (31Huang K.P. Huang F.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Huang K.P. Huang F.L. Li J. Schuck P. McPhie P.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although regulation of CaMKII by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, aggregation, and association with other proteins has been extensively investigated, direct modulation of this enzyme by oxidant has not been explored. In this study we showed that CaMKII in mouse brain synaptosomes, and in the purified preparation, is very susceptible to oxidant-mediated modification. Interestingly, a similar oxidative modification of CaMKII was observed in the acutely prepared mouse hippocampal slices under ischemic conditions. Using two potential mediators of oxidants in the brain, glutathione disulfide S-monoxide (GS-DSMO) and glutathione disulfide S-dioxide (GS-DSDO), we demonstrated that the purified CaMKII oxidized by these two compounds exhibited certain characteristics resembling those modified enzymes in the oxidant-treated synaptosomes and in the ischemic hippocampal slices. The ischemia-evoked oxidation of CaMKII was not readily reversed by re-oxygenation, and this lingering oxidative modification also suppressed the autophosphorylation of the kinase and synaptic potentiation post ischemia.

The materials used in the study were obtained from the indicated sources: sodium nitroprusside (SNP), diamide, bovine serum albumin, glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide, iodoacetamide, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) from Sigma-Aldrich; H2O2 from Fisher Scientific; [35S]GSH from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.; Percoll, CaM-Sepharose 4B, and MicroSpin G-25 column from Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare; a 95% N2/5% CO2 gas cylinder from Roberts Oxygen; Bradford protein assay reagent and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG from Bio-Rad; autocamtide-2 from Bachem; CaM from Calbiochem; mouse monoclonal antibody against glutathionylated protein from ViroGen; mouse antibodies against α and β CaMKII from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; and mouse antibody against Thr-286-PO4 α CaMKII from Promega. Preparation of Mouse Brain Synaptosomes and Treatment with Oxidants—Mouse forebrains were homogenized using a Teflon glass homogenizer with 10 volumes (v/w) of ice-cold solution containing 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT (pH 7.4) according to Dunkley et al. (34Dunkley P.R. Jarvie P.E. Heath J.W. Kidd G.J. Rostas J.A. Brain Res. 1986; 372: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and 2-ml aliquots of the supernatant (adjusted to 5 mg/ml) were layered on top of each discontinuous 4-step Percoll gradient comprising 2 ml each of 23, 15, 10, and 3% Percoll in sucrose solution made up in 10-ml polycarbonate tubes. After centrifugation at 32,500 × g for 5 min, the fractions concentrated at interface of 10/15% and 15/23% Percoll were collected, diluted 2-fold with washing buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm DTT), and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was washed twice with 5-ml washing buffer and suspended in oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2) ACSF (in mm: NaCl 124, KCl 4.9, MgSO4 1.3, CaCl2 2.5, KH2PO4 1.2, NaHCO3 25.6, and d-glucose 10, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm DTT. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, synaptosomes (0.5 mg/ml) were treated with H2O2, diamide, and SNP for 2–10 min. For assay of CaMKII, samples were immediately centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was kept frozen in dry ice. Synaptosomal homogenates were prepared by sonication of the pellet in Buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm KF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 nm okadaic acid, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin), and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min to collect the supernatant for activity measurement. For immunoblot analysis, iodoacetamide (10 mm) was added to the oxidant-treated samples and centrifuged to collect the pellet. Synaptosomal homogenates were prepared by sonication of the pellet in Buffer A plus 10 mm iodoacetamide. Samples (30 μg) were resolved by 8–16% SDS-gel under reducing and non-reducing condition (boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with and without mercaptoethanol, respectively), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the various antibodies. Isolation of Postsynaptic Density from Oxidant-treated Synaptosomes—The PSD was prepared by a procedure modified from the previously described methods (35Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 36Villasana L.E. Klann E. Tejada-Simon M.V. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 158: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly prepared synaptosomes (3 mg each, 0.5 mg/ml) were treated with H2O2 (0.5 mm), diamide (0.1 mm), or SNP (0.1 mm) for 10 min in oxygenated ACSF. The reaction was terminated with iodoacetamide (10 mm) and immediately centrifuged in Eppendorf Micro centrifuge at 7,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellets were suspended in 2.5 ml of Buffer B (12 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, containing 32 mm sucrose and 1% Triton X-100) and stirred at 4 °C for 15 min. The solution was centrifuged at 33,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of the same buffer. The samples were layered onto discontinuous sucrose gradient containing 2 ml of 1.5 m sucrose/1 mm NaHCO3 and 2.8 ml of 1 m sucrose/1 mm NaHCO3 and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C using a Beckman SW65 rotor. The resulting pellets were suspended in 1 ml of Buffer B plus 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100/150 mm KCl and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 60 min using a Beckman 70-Ti rotor. The resulting PSD was dispersed by sonication in 50 μl of synaptosomal homogenization buffer, and samples (5 μg of protein) were analyzed by immunoblot. Preparation of Mouse Hippocampal Slices and Induction of Ischemic Stress—Mouse transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared from adult mice as previously described (37Huang F.L. Huang K.P. Wu J. Boucheron C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6230-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and were kept in oxygenated ACSF at room temperature for 1–2 h for recovery after slicing. To induce ischemic stress, slices were incubated in a modified ACSF containing 10 mm sucrose (to replace glucose) previously saturated with 95% N2/5% CO2 based on the established hippocampal slice model of ischemia (38Westgate S.A. Brown J. Aronowski J. Waxham M.N. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2217-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At timed intervals samples (4–8 slices) were removed from the medium and immediately homogenized in 400 μl of Buffer A plus 10 mm iodoacetamide. Homogenates were centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was sonicated in 200 μl of the same buffer containing 1% SDS. Equivalent amount of proteins from the soluble and pellet fractions were resolved by reducing and non-reducing 8–16% gradient SDS-gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-α CaMKII antibody. For measurement of the kinase activity, tissue slices were kept frozen immediately after removal of the medium. Slices were homogenized in Buffer A, and the homogenates (1–2 μg) were assayed for CaMKII activity with or without Ca2+/CaM with autocamtide-2 as a substrate. Electrophysiology—Hippocampal slices were placed in a submerged recording chamber using glass electrodes (1–4 MΩ), filled with ACSF, for stimulation of Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers and for recording of field EPSP (fEPSP) from the stratum radiatum of the CA 1 region. Slices were superfused with ACSF at a flow rate of ∼2 ml/min, and a test pulse was delivered at 20-s intervals with a current that evoked ∼30% of the maximal response. After establishing a stable baseline with oxygenated ACSF, slices were subjected to ischemia by perfusion with modified ACSF saturated with 95% N2/5% CO2 for 10 min and switched back to oxygenated ACSF. After re-establishment of stable baseline for at least 10 min, the slices were subjected to high frequency stimulation (HFS) at 100 Hz for 1 s. The control slices were perfused only with oxygenated ACSF and stimulated with the same HFS. Potentials were digitized by CED Power 1401 (Cambridge Electronic Design) and analyzed by Signal 2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). The slope of the fEPSP was used to measure the responses. Potentiation after HFS was expressed as percentage of the initial baseline recording. For comparison between responses of different samples after HFS, the last 5-min blocks of recording were analyzed. Purification and Assay of CaMKII—Fresh mouse brain, after removal of cerebellum and brain stem, was homogenized with Teflon glass homogenizer in 10 volumes (v/w) of buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting pellet was homogenized again in the same buffer (one-half of the original volume) and centrifuged to remove the pellet. The combined supernatant was precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate (60% saturation), centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 15 min, and the precipitated protein dissolved in Buffer C (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.1 mm PMSF). The solution was clarified by centrifugation and pressed through a 0.45-μm filter, loaded onto a CaM-Sepharose column, and washed successively with five bed volumes each of Buffer C, Buffer C plus 1 m NaCl, and Buffer C again. CaMKII was eluted from the column with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm PMSF. Fractions containing active kinase were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-4 Ultracel-10k device. The purified enzyme was kept frozen at –20 °C, and purity was checked by SDS-PAGE. CaMKII activity was measured at 30 °C for 2 min in a mixture (25 μl) containing 30 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1000–2000 cpm/pmol), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EGTA, ±1.2 μm CaM/2.4 mm CaCl2, and 80 μm autocamtide-2. Treatment of Purified CaMKII with Oxidants—CaMKII (1 mg/ml, 50–100 μl) was incubated in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, and 2 mm DTT at room temperature for 30 min to reduce protein sulfhydryl groups. These proteins were then loaded on G-25 MicroSpin columns, which had been equilibrated with the same buffer, and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 7 s in an Eppendorf Micro centrifuge to separate reduced kinase from DTT. Protein and residual DTT concentrations were determined before addition of oxidants to the indicated concentrations, which were the net after subtraction of the free -SH in the samples. CaMKII (1–2 μg/assay) was incubated with oxidant at room temperature for the indicated times, and the reaction was terminated by addition of iodoacetamide (final 10 mm). Samples were resolved by reducing or non-reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot analysis. For assay of CaMKII, samples were taken at the indicated times, and the activity was determined with autocamtide-2 as a substrate. To determine the effects of oxidation on CaMKII autophosphorylation, the enzyme was incubated with oxidants at room temperature for 10 min, and then chilled on ice before initiation of reaction with ice-cold reaction mixture. CaMKII autophosphorylation was assayed on ice for 3 min in a reaction mixture containing 30 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 6 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm ATP, 2 mm EGTA, and 1.2 μm CaM/2.4 mm CaCl2. Reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer with or without reducing agent and analyzed by immunoblot with antibody against Thr-286-PO4 α CaMKII. Miscellaneous Methods—Glycerol density gradient centrifugation of CaMKII was carried out according to the procedure of Martin and Ames (39Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with an SW-65 rotor. CaMKII or standard protein mixtures, including rabbit muscle aldolase (Mr 160,000), catalase (Mr 250,000), and ferretin (Mr 440,000), were layered on top of a 5-ml 8–30% glycerol gradient in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 60,000 rpm at 4 °C for 4 h in a Beckman ultracentrifuge with both the acceleration and deceleration settings at 4. Fractions of 125 μl were carefully removed from the top, and every other fraction was analyzed for CaMKII by immunoblot under reducing or non-reducing conditions. The sedimentation of standard proteins was identified by staining the SDS-gel with Coomassie Blue. Preparation and assay of GS-DSMO and GS-DSDO were carried as previously described (33Huang K.P. Huang F.L. Shetty P.K. Yergey A.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was carried out by resolving proteins in 8–16% gradient gels containing 0.1% SDS, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoreactivity was revealed by ECL reagents, and band intensity was quantified by Kodak Image Station analysis software or by NIH ImageJ program. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye-binding assay. For statistical analysis, results were expressed as mean ± S.E., and comparisons between groups were made using Sigma Stat one-way analysis of variance or t test. In all cases, p < 0.05 was considered significant. Oxidative Modification of CaMKII in Mouse Brain Synaptosomes—To test the oxidative modification of CaMKII, we initially employed mouse brain synaptosomal preparation for the in vitro experiments. CaMKII is known to be highly enriched in the synaptosomes and treatment of these fractions with H2O2 (0.5 mm), diamide (0.1 mm), and SNP (0.1 mm) caused an inactivation of the total CaMKII activity as compared with the control (Fig. 1A). The activator-independent activity, with the exception of the H2O2-treated one (∼30% reduction), was not significantly altered by these oxidants. It appears that these oxidants preferentially inactivate the non-phosphorylated enzyme. The synaptosomal extracts derived from samples treated with H2O2 (Fig. 1B, lane 2), diamide (Fig. 1B, lane 3), and SNP (Fig. 1B, lane 4) along with un-treated control (Fig. 1B, lane 1) were resolved by 8–16% SDS-gel under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Immunoblot with antibody against α or β CaMKII revealed that these oxidants caused extensive oxidation of the kinase to form large molecular weight aggregates under non-reducing conditions. These aggregates were formed largely by disulfide bonds as revealed by dissolution of these high molecular weight bands under reducing conditions. The immunoreactivities of the monomeric α (50 kDa) and β (60 kDa) subunits were reduced or diminished under non-reducing conditions, and their band intensities were nearly equal under the reducing conditions (Fig. 1B). The synaptosomal extracts exhibited ∼15–20% of the Ca2+/CaM-independent kinase activity, and the Thr-286-autophosphorylated α CaMKII was also susceptible to oxidative modification. Under non-reducing conditions, the monomeric autophosphorylated α CaMKII was greatly reduced as compared with the control; yet, the activator-independent activity remained largely intact with the exception of that treated with H2O2. Under reducing conditions, the oxidized Thr-286-PO4 α CaMKII reappeared as monomeric form (Fig. 1B). These findings suggest that oxidative modification of CaMKII can promote its aggregation, partly, through formation of disulfide bonds. Association of the Oxidized CaMKII with the PSD—CaMKII has been shown to associate with the PSD, where it interacts with several postsynaptic structural and signaling proteins. Oxidative modification of the kinase, which undoubtedly will cause a large conformational change, may disrupt the interaction with its binding partners. To investigate if oxidants caused changes in the distribution of CaMKII with PSD, the oxidant-treated synaptosomes were lysed in Triton X-100 containing buffer (synaptosomal extracts), centrifuged to collect the detergent insoluble fraction (crude PSD), and further fractionated by density gradient centrifugation to isolate PSD. All these fractions were analyzed by immunob"

Analysis by isothermal microcalorimetry and calcium titration under conditions of low membrane occupancy showed that there was a strongly positive entropy change upon binding. For vesicles containing 25% phosphatidylserine at 0.15 m ionic strength, the free energy of binding was –53 kcal/mol protein, whereas the enthalpy of binding was –38 kcal/mol. Addition of 4 m urea decreased the free energy of binding by about 30% without denaturing the protein, suggesting that hydrophobic forces make a significant contribution to binding affinity. This was confirmed by mutagenesis studies that showed that binding affinity was modulated by the hydrophobicity of surface residues that are likely to enter the interfacial region upon protein-membrane binding. The change in free energy was quantitatively consistent with predictions from the Wimley-White scale of interfacial hydrophobicity. In contrast, binding affinity was not increased by making the protein surface more positively charged, nor decreased by making it more negatively charged, ruling out general ionic interactions as major contributors to binding affinity. The affinity of annexin V was the same regardless of the head group present on the anionic phospholipids tested (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethanol, and cardiolipin), ruling out specific interactions between the protein and non-phosphate moieties of the head group as a significant contributor to binding affinity. Analysis by fluorescence resonance energy transfer showed that multimers did not form on phosphatidylserine membranes at low occupancy, indicating that annexin-annexin interactions did not contribute to binding affinity. In summary, binding of annexin V to membranes is driven by both enthalpic and entropic forces. Dehydration of hydrophobic regions of the protein surface as they enter the interfacial region makes an important contribution to overall binding affinity, supplementing the role of protein-calcium-phosphate chelates.

Dehydration of hydrophobic regions of the protein surface as they enter the interfacial region makes an important contribution to overall binding affinity, supplementing the role of protein-calcium-phosphate chelates. The annexins are a family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins with diverse functions (1Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 2Moss S.E. Morgan R.O. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 219Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar), most of which involve interaction with membranes. Some members of the family have been implicated in disease states (4Rand J.H. Wu X.X. Thromb. Res. 2004; 114: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Cesarman-Maus G. Rios-Luna N.P. Deora A.B. Huang B. Villa R. Cravioto Mdel C. Alarcon-Segovia D.

Annexin V is a typical member of this protein family that has also received particular attention as a diagnostic agent to measure cell death in vivo in many different diseases (6Blankenberg F.G. Katsikis P.D. Tait J.F. Davis R.E. Naumovski L. Ohtsuki K. Kopiwoda S. Abrams M.J. Darkes M. Robbins R.C. Maecker H.T. Strauss H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Further work on understanding the functions and potential clinical applications of annexins will be greatly facilitated by a fuller understanding of the structural and mechanistic basis for their interaction with membranes.Annexins bind to membranes with remarkably high affinity (8Tait J.F.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2833-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the mechanistic basis for this reaction is complex. There is broad agreement on the importance of calcium for the interaction of annexins with membranes at neutral pH. Calcium is thought to mediate binding via formation of calcium bridges between protein and membrane phospholipid head groups (14Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Beyond this, there is little agreement on the key factors governing binding affinity, and many different theories have been suggested. General electrostatic interactions may occur between positively charged amino acids and negatively charged groups on the membrane. There may be insertion of specific hydrophobic residues, such as Trp-187, into the hydrophobic region of the membrane (15Meers P. Mealy T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5411-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Concha N.O. Head J.F. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). There may also be specific interactions between protein side chains and non-phosphate components of the phospholipid head groups (14Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 17Meers P. Mealy T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5829-5837Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Finally, formation of trimers and higher order multimers has been postulated to promote membrane binding via formation of favorable protein-protein interactions on the membrane surface (13Patel D.R.

Biol. 2000; 304: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Recently, we developed methods for quantitative measurement of the binding of annexin V to cells and phospholipid vesicles, which allow one to determine the free energy of binding for individual protein molecules (22Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Jin M. Smith C. Hsieh H.Y. Gibson D.F. Tait J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40351-40357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These methods rely on calcium titration performed at low levels of membrane occupancy, which overcomes the difficulties of analyzing a full binding isotherm previously identified by Bazzi and Nelsestuen (24Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7970-7977Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Cell Signal. 1993; 5: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This method allowed us to determine that under physiological conditions there are about eight high-affinity calcium binding sites, formed by the A and B helices in each of the four domains, that account for about 70% of the free energy of binding (23Jin M. Smith C. Hsieh H.Y. Gibson D.F. Tait J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40351-40357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to investigate the source of the remaining ∼30% of binding energy, and thereby gain insight into the structural and mechanistic basis for the binding reaction. We find that there is a strongly positive entropy change upon binding, which we attribute to hydrophobic interactions in the interfacial region of the membrane bilayer. We also found that nonspecific ionic interactions, protein-head group interactions, and protein-protein interactions did not contribute significantly to binding affinity. We present an overall quantitative model to explain these results under “Discussion.”EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant proteins were prepared as described: human wild-type annexin V (26Wood B.L.

Unless noted differently, the vesicles were composed of 25% PS (1-palmitoyl,2-oleoyl) 2The abbreviations used are:PSphosphatidylserineC7-PCdiheptanoyl-phosphatidylcholineEC50calcium concentration causing 50% of maximum protein-membrane bindingFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferIAFiodoacetamidofluoresceinPCphosphatidylcholineR-PErhodamine-labeled phosphatidylethanolaminepKdnegative logarithm of equilibrium dissociation constant KdRBCred blood cells.

Phospholipids with different anionic head groups tested were heart cardiolipin (number 840012), 1,2-dioleoyl-phosphatidylmethanol (number 840420), and 1-palmitoyl,2-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (number 840457). Other reagents were from Sigma.Construction, Expression, and Fluorescent Labeling of Annexin V Mutants—Expression vectors were constructed from the base plasmid pJ128 (23Jin M. Smith C. Hsieh H.Y. Gibson D.F. Tait J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40351-40357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which expresses a 325-amino acid protein (named annexin V-128) similar to wild-type human annexin V but with these changes: 1) an N-terminal extension of (Met)-Ala-Gly-Gly-Cys-Gly-His; 2) deletion of the initiator Met at position 1 of wild-type annexin V; 3) a point mutation C316S. Point mutations were made with the QuikChange Multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After construction and cloning, each mutant vector was sequenced through the entire protein-coding region to verify the presence of the desired mutation(s) and the absence of unintended mutations. Each annexin V mutant protein was named with an arbitrary numerical suffix. For protein expression, plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain Tuner (DE3) pLacI (Novagen, Madison, WI) and expressed and purified as described (23Jin M. Smith C. Hsieh H.Y. Gibson D.F. Tait J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40351-40357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The yield and chromatographic behavior of all mutant proteins were comparable with that of annexin V-128, suggesting that all proteins were stable and did not have grossly altered conformations. Protein purity was ≥98% as judged by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. Proteins were quantitated with an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 0.6 ml/mg·cm (27Funakoshi T. Heimark R.L. Hendrickson L.E. McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) (with appropriate adjustment for the W187A mutant). Annexin V-128 and mutant proteins were labeled specifically on the N-terminal cysteine with IAF (Sigma) as described (22Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and purified after labeling with the same MonoQ chromatography step used for unlabeled proteins. A few proteins used in FRET assays were also labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 C5 maleimide (Invitrogen), using the same procedure.Fluorescence Quenching Vesicle Binding Assay—The affinity of IAF-annexin V-128 for phospholipid vesicles was determined by calcium titration as described by Tait et al. (22Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); binding is detected by quenching of fluorescein fluorescence due to resonance energy transfer upon binding to vesicles containing 2% rhodamine-labeled phospholipid. Unless noted otherwise, vesicle binding assays were performed at 25 °C with 1 nm IAF-annexin V-128 and 10 μm vesicles containing 25% PS and 2% R-PE in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin. A concentration of 10 μm vesicles corresponds to 100 nm of binding sites assuming about 100 phospholipid molecules per binding site (counting phospholipids on both faces of the bilayer) (22Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); the vesicle membrane was therefore ≤1% saturated with protein throughout the titration. Fluorescence measurements were made on a Victor3 Model 1420 fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation at 485 ± 7 nm and emission at 535 ± 25 nm.Calcium titrations were analyzed as described (22Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) based on the following model of the binding reaction between calcium ions, annexin V, and membrane binding sites in Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. nCa+protein+membrane↔protein·Ca8·membrane(Eq. 1) Kd=[Ca]n[membrane][protein]/[protein·Can·membrane](Eq. 2) Kd=EC50n[membrane](Eq. 3) pKd=-logKd=-(nlogEC50+log[membrane])(Eq. 4) ΔG=RTlnKd=-1.365×pKdat25∘C(Eq. 5) The EC50 and calcium stoichiometry (n) values were determined by non-linear least-squares fitting of the calcium titration curves to the following function, Q/Qmax=[Ca]n/([Ca]n+EC50n)(Eq. 6) where Q is the observed fluorescence quenching at a given calcium concentration, and Qmax is the maximum quenching observed (about 0.8) when all fluorescent protein is bound to the vesicles.Cell Binding Assay—Affinities of mutant proteins for RBC with exposed PS were measured by calcium titration under conditions of low membrane occupancy as described by Tait et al. (22Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). RBC binding assays were performed with 1 nm IAF-protein and 1 × 108 cells in 1 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The concentration of binding sites was about 180 nm, assuming that each RBC contains 1.1 × 106 binding site (22Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); the membrane was therefore ≤0.6% saturated with protein throughout the titration.FRET Assay for Formation of Annexin V Multimers—Assays were performed in a buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin. Phospholipid vesicles consisted of 25% PS, 20% C7PC, 55% PC, or 100% PS. A calcium concentration of 0.1 mm was used for most experiments with 100% PS, and a calcium concentration of 1 mm for most experiments with 25% PS. In most experiments (“vesicles last” protocol), buffer, calcium, IAF-labeled protein (0.5 nm), and Alexa Fluor 546-labeled protein (2.5 nm) were combined and mixed once; phospholipid vesicles were then added at various concentrations from 0 to 100 μm and the sample was mixed again and incubated 5 min at room temperature in the dark. In some experiments (“vesicles first” protocol), the vesicles were added in the first step, and the two fluorescent proteins in the second step. Fluorescence intensity (excitation at 485 nm, emission at 535 nm) was measured on triplicate 300-μl reaction aliquots on a Victor3 plate reader as described above. Fluorescent quenching was calculated relative to the fluorescence value of a sample without phospholipid vesicles.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed at 25 °C on a Micro-Cal VP-ITC (MicroCal LLC, Northampton, MA). Unless otherwise indicated, both the calcium titrant and the sample in the calorimetric cell were in a buffer of 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3 that was thoroughly degassed prior to the experiment. The syringe burette contained 300 μl of 20 mm CaCl2 in this buffer, and aliquots were injected at 300-s intervals. The first injection was 0.75 μl to expel the initial dead volume of the syringe and resulted in no heat release. The following injections were conducted in sets of five repetitions, and in each subsequent set, the injected volume was doubled, starting at 1.5 μl (5 × 1.5 μl, 5 × 3 μl, 5 × 6 μl, etc.). The titration was stopped when the heat of reaction was no longer detected and only the heat of dilution was observed. The calorimetric cell, stirred at 394 rpm, initially contained 1.37 ml of 2.0 mm vesicles and 0.2 to 20 μm annexin V. As CaCl2 was injected into the sample cell, the rate of heat release was measured against a reference cell containing water, whereas the system remained at 25 °C. The raw data were integrated with Origin 7.0 to obtain the total evolved heat per injection.In control experiments, CaCl2 was titrated into a solution of vesicles and buffer only, which generated small, linear, nonsaturable exothermic heat responses. This control, accounting for heats of calcium dilution and interaction with vesicles, was subtracted from the experimental titrations that included both protein and vesicles in the calorimetric cell. The molar ΔH was calculated from the cumulative heat at the plateau divided by the amount of annexin V in the calorimeter cell.To test for possible effects of denatured annexin V on the calculated molar enthalpy values, the relative amounts of active and inactive protein were determined by analyzing annexin V-vesicle mixtures by two methods. Gel filtration chromatography (Superose 12 resin) indicated that only 1% of the annexin V did not bind to vesicles. Centrifugal ultrafiltration (Centricon 100 concentrator) showed that only 5% of the annexin V passed through the filter.RESULTSComparison of Enthalpy and Free Energy Values as a Function of Membrane Occupancy—To allow direct comparison between ΔH and ΔG values, isothermal calorimetry titrations were performed with the same reagents used to determine affinity in the fluorescence quenching vesicle titrations. Initial experiments performed at high ratios of protein to membrane were consistent with earlier studies of annexin V from other groups (11Plager D.A. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13239-13249Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Patel D.R. Isas J.M. Ladokhin A.S. Jao C.C. Kim Y.E. Kirsch T. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2833-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, calcium titration of 20 μm annexin V and 2 mm vesicles containing 25% PS in a buffer of 0.15 m ionic strength was strongly exothermic and reached a flat and stable end point. Calcium titration of 2 mm vesicles alone was slightly exothermic and showed a linear, non-saturable response, primarily reflecting weak interactions between calcium and membrane phospholipids. The heat released in the vesicle-only titration was taken as the most appropriate blank and was subtracted from the heat released in the vesicle + protein titrations to give the net heat release plotted in the figures.Calcium titrations were performed over a wide range of annexin V concentrations to measure the heat response as a function of membrane occupancy (Fig. 1). As expected from earlier work with binding assays, the titration curves became steeper and shifted to the left as the protein:phospholipid ratio was decreased. However, the enthalpy per mole annexin V remained fairly constant, staying in a range of about –35 to –41 kcal/mol over the range from 1 to 100% occupancy (Fig. 1C). The average ΔH value is –37.5 ± 0.6 kcal/mol (mean ± S.E., n = 16) over the whole range of membrane occupancy. Low protein concentrations generate small heat signals, which are more susceptible to experimental error and probably explain the higher variability in enthalpy at low membrane occupancy. At the higher end of the occupancy range, there is some uncertainty about the exact point of 100% occupancy under these assay conditions; if there is some free protein left in solution for the titration performed with 20 μm annexin V, this may account for the slightly lower molar enthalpy value obtained at nominal 100% occupancy.To allow direct comparison between enthalpy and entropy values, the ΔG of binding was determined as a function of membrane occupancy. The experimental ΔG of binding at 1% occupancy is –52.8 ± l.5 kcal/mol (mean ± S.E., n = 25), based on a pKd value of 38.7 as determined by the calcium titration assay (see Table 1 below). The free energy of binding is about 15 kcal/mol more negative than the enthalpy of binding under the same conditions, indicating a large positive entropy change when annexin V binds to membranes (Fig. 1C).TABLE 1Binding affinity as a function of phospholipid head groupAnionic phospholipidEC50npKNumber of measurementsmmCardiolipin, 25%0.039 ± 0.0017.4 ± 0.439.8 ± 2.05Phosphatidylmethanol, 25%0.082 ± 0.0107.8 ± 0.838.8 ± 3.47Phosphatidylserine, 25%0.122 ± 0.0238.1 ± 1.338.7 ± 5.425Phosphatidylglycerol, 25%0.145 ± 0.0048.6 ± 0.639.9 ± 2.25Phosphatidylserine, 98%0.062 ± 0.00211.8 ± 1.156.6 ± 4.67 Open table in a new tab At higher occupancy, it is not possible to measure ΔG directly by fitting binding isotherms to a single binding constant due to the negative cooperativity of binding with respect to protein. The ΔG value was thus calculated from a model developed by Bazzi and Nelsestuen (24Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7970-7977Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), in which one estimates a stepwise EC50 value at various levels of membrane occupancy for titrations carried out from 0 to 100% occupancy and then calculates the stepwise ΔG by assuming a constant calcium stoichiometry at all occupancies (Fig. 2, A and B). As occupancy increases, the calculated ΔG value progressively decreases (Fig. 2C), and the difference between enthalpy and free energy becomes smaller as the membrane approaches saturation. Control experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed only 1–5% inactive protein in the annexin V preparations used for calorimetry, indicating that the large difference between enthalpy and free energy was not simply due to an inaccurate protein denominator in the calculation of molar enthalpies.FIGURE 2Calculation of free energy of binding as a function of membrane occupancy. Panel A, experimental data for titration to 100% occupancy. Calcium titrations were performed by fluorescence quenching assay with 1 nm IAF-annexin V-128 and 0.1 μm phospholipid vesicles (25% PS, 2% R-PE, 48% PC, 20% C7-PC). Results are expressed as a percentage of maximum quenching, and are the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments. Panel B, theoretical curves for stepwise binding of individual annexin V molecules at different levels of membrane occupancy. Data of panel A were used to determine the calcium concentration required to induce binding of an additional annexin V molecule at occupancy levels of 10, 20, 30%, etc. These calcium concentrations were then used as EC50 values to calculate theoretical binding curves from Equation 6 assuming a constant calcium stoichiometry of 8 at all occupancy levels (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 24Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7970-7977Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Curves from left to right represent individual binding events occurring at occupancy levels of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90%. Panel C, stepwise and average ΔG values as function of membrane occupancy. Stepwise ΔG values (Δ) for individual binding events occurring at occupancy levels of 10, 20, 30% etc. were calculated with Equations 4 and 5 based on the EC50 values from panel B and a calcium stoichiometry of 8. The ΔG value at 1% occupancy is calculated directly from the experimentally determined pKd value given in Table 1. For comparison with ΔH values given in Fig. 1, which are cumulative, a cumulative ΔG (□) is calculated as the average of all preceding stepwise ΔG values up to that level of occupancy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results were further confirmed by a limited number of experiments with vesicles containing 50% PS in a buffer with 0.05 m Na+. Over the range from 10 to 100% occupancy, the molar enthalpy was nearly constant, averaging –46 ± 2.0 (mean ± S.D., n = 3) kcal/mol annexin V. The corresponding experimental ΔG value was –63 kcal/mol (based on a pKd value of 46 at 1% occupancy) (23Jin M. Smith C. Hsieh H.Y. Gibson D.F. Tait J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40351-40357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), again much larger than the enthalpy of binding under these conditions. The enthalpy and free energy of binding are both higher than the values obtained with 25% PS vesicles at 0.15 m ionic strength, consistent with higher affinity binding previously observed as sodium concentration decreases and membrane PS content increases (22Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The calcium stoichiometry calculated from the linear portion of the isothermal calorimetry titration curve was about 12 mol Ca2+/ mol annexin V, consistent with earlier results showing calcium stoichiometries from 11 to 13 under conditions that maximally favor binding (13Patel D.R.

https://openalex.org/W2080473403,"Fusion proteins of the extracellular parts of cytokine receptors, also known as cytokine traps, turned out to be promising cytokine inhibitors useful in anti-cytokine therapies. Here we present newly designed cytokine traps for murine and human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as prototypes for inhibitors targeting cytokines that signal through a heterodimer of two signaling receptors of the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) family. LIF signals through a receptor heterodimer of LIF receptor (LIFR) and gp130 and induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 leading to target gene expression. The analysis of various receptor fusion and deletion constructs revealed that a truncated form of the murine LIF receptor consisting of the first five extracellular domains was a potent inhibitor for human LIF. For the efficient inhibition of murine LIF, the cytokine-binding module of murine gp130 had to be fused to the first five domains of murine LIFR generating mLIF-RFP (murine LIFR fusion protein). The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and subsequent gene induction induced by human or murine LIF are completely blocked by the respective inhibitor. Furthermore, both inhibitors are specific and do not alter the bioactivities of the closely related cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and oncostatin M. The gained knowledge on the construction of LIF inhibitors can be transferred to the design of inhibitors for related cytokines such as IL-31, IL-27, and oncostatin M for the treatment of inflammatory and malignant diseases.

A dimeric soluble TNF receptor is currently used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases caused by elevated TNF expression (1Goldenberg M.M. Clin. Ther. 1999; 21: 75-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Whereas TNF signals through a receptor homotrimer, most cytokines signal through receptor complexes consisting of two or more different receptor subunits. In this case, the respective cytokine can be inhibited by using fusion proteins composed of the different soluble receptors, as we and others showed for the inhibition of IL-6 (2Ancey C. Küster A.

All cytokines signaling through the common receptor subunit gp130 belong to the family of IL-6-type cytokines (5Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar), which includes IL-6, IL-11, IL-27, LIF, OSM, ciliary neurotrophic factor, cardiotrophin-1, cardiotophin-like cytokine, and neuropoietin. IL-6-type cytokines contain distinct receptor-binding sites that were discovered by mutagenesis studies on IL-6, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and LIF (6Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rose-John S. Proteins. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D.

The IL-6-type cytokines can be subdivided into those containing three (I, II, and III) or two (II and III) receptor-binding sites. Site I determines the specificity of α-receptor binding. The α-receptor is not capable of transferring the signal into the cell but is crucial for increasing the binding affinity of the cytokine to its signaling receptors. Site II seems to be the universal gp130-binding site of all IL-6-type cytokines. Depending on the cytokine, site III is used for the recruitment of LIFR, OSMR, or a second gp130 molecule (5Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). The IL-6 inhibitor IL-6-RFP (2Ancey C. Küster A. Haan S. Herrmann A. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Biol.

However, there are also IL-6-type cytokines, which do not need to recruit an α-receptor analogous to human IL-6Rα, and thus do not seem to have a functional site I. One example for a cytokine belonging to this group is the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In this study we present an approach to construct inhibitory receptor fusion proteins for human and murine LIF as prototypes of inhibitors targeting cytokines whose receptors only bind to the site II and III of the cytokine without occupying site I. We designate these inhibitors “site II/III inhibitors.” LIF signals through a heterodimer of LIFR and gp130. Janus tyrosine kinases that are constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic parts of gp130 (9Giese B. Au-Yeung C.K. Herrmann A. Diefenbach S. Haan C. Kuster A. Wortmann S.B. Roderburg C.

Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar) are activated upon ligand binding and phosphorylate the receptors and the recruited transcription factor STAT3. Activated STAT3 dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus, where it induces LIF target genes (11Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). We wanted to integrate only those receptor domains of gp130 and LIFR into the inhibitory receptor fusion proteins that are necessary for LIF binding. For gp130, which includes six extracellular domains (D1–D6), it has been clearly shown that domains D2 and D3 forming the cytokine-binding module (CBM) are necessary and sufficient for LIF binding (12Boulanger M.J. Bankovich A.J. Kortemme T. Baker D. Garcia K.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, there are contradictory statements in the literature with regard to the domains of LIFR involved in LIF binding. The LIFR is a protein of 190 kDa, which includes eight extracellular domains (D1–D8); these are an N-terminal CBM (D1 and D2), an Ig-like domain (D3), a C-terminal CBM (D4 and D5), and three fibronectin-type III-like (FNIII) domains (D6–D8) (13Gearing D.P.

The LIFR belongs to the family of tall cytokine receptors. Within this family the three membrane-proximal FNIII domains are dispensable for ligand binding, as it was shown by mutagenesis studies of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (14Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and gp130 (15Horsten U. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Müllberg J. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the literature, different parts of the LIFR are proposed as the minimal requirement for LIF binding. Apart from a few studies in which the binding between hLIF and mLIFR was investigated (16Layton M.J. Cross B.A. Metcalf D. Ward L.D. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23976-23985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), most studies focused on the binding of hLIF to hLIFR. Whereas two groups (17Owczarek C.M. Zhang Y.

Oppmann B. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Kallen K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, He et al. (20He W. Gong K. Zhu G. Smith D.K. Ip N.Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21He W. Gong K. Smith D.K. Ip N.Y. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4317-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) state that LIF only binds to the Ig-like domain and the C-terminal CBM of LIFR. The N-terminal CBM does not bind LIF at all. The N-terminal CBM is required for ciliary neurotrophic factor binding and signaling (20He W. Gong K. Zhu G. Smith D.K. Ip N.Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21He W. Gong K. Smith D.K. Ip N.Y. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4317-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In another study (12Boulanger M.J. Bankovich A.J. Kortemme T. Baker D. Garcia K.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), only the Ig-like domain of LIFR is proposed to mediate LIF binding to the LIFR. In view of these hypotheses we fused the proposed domains of murine LIFR to the CBM (D2 and D3) of human or murine gp130 to generate putative human or murine LIF inhibitors, respectively. It had already been demonstrated that the natural inhibitor of murine LIF, namely the LIF-binding protein (LBP), a truncated, extracellular form of the mLIFR, binds mLIF with relatively low affinity (about 600–2000 pm) (16Layton M.J. Cross B.A. Metcalf D. Ward L.D. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8616-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Owczarek C.M. Zhang Y. Layton M.J. Metcalf D. Roberts B. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23976-23985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) similar to the membrane-bound mLIFR. It was our aim to increase the binding affinity of LBP to mLIF by fusing distinct domains of the mLIFR to the CBM of murine gp130 and thereby generating a high affinity inhibitor for murine LIF. For the construction of potent human LIF inhibitors, we made use of the unusual species cross-reactivity of mLIFR toward human LIF. Although hLIF binds to the hLIFR with a relatively low affinity (about 600–2000 pm), it binds to the mLIFR with a much higher affinity (about 10–20 pm). This phenomenon is primarily mediated by the Ig-like domain (17Owczarek C.M. Zhang Y. Layton M.J. Metcalf D. Roberts B. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23976-23985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we integrated domains of the mLIFR not only into the possible murine but also into the possible human LIF inhibitors. In this study we describe the development of specific inhibitors for human and murine LIF based on the ligand-binding domains of the corresponding soluble receptors. Cloning of LIF Inhibitors—All LIF inhibitors were constructed in the same way; the desired domains of mLIFR were located behind the N-terminal signal sequence and fused through a peptide linker to D2 and D3 of human or murine gp130. C-terminally a FLAG tag was added. Human LIF inhibitors contained the linker stalk-49 (2Ancey C. Küster A. Haan S. Herrmann A. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16968-16972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and murine LIF inhibitors the linker AGS-41 (2Ancey C. Küster A. Haan S. Herrmann A. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16968-16972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) consisting of 49 and 41 amino acids, respectively. The domains of the murine LIFR were flanked by XbaI and XmaI restriction sites, the linkers by XmaI and NheI, the respective gp130(D2–D3) fragment by NheI and ApaI, and the FLAG tag by ApaI and BamHI restriction sites. All LIF-RFP constructs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSVL that contains an SV40 promoter (GE Health-care). For the amplification of human gp130(D2–D3), the plasmid pSVL-hgp130 was used as a template, which contains the complete cDNA of human gp130. For generating constructs containing domains of murine LIFR or murine gp130, whole mRNA isolated from mouse liver was reversely transcribed into cDNA using random primers. The cDNA served as a template for amplifying the desired sequences of mLIFR or mgp130. For cloning of the construct mLIFR(D2–D4)-mgp130(D2–D3), the plasmid pSVL-mLIFR(D2–D4)-hgp130(D2–D3) was cut with XmaI and NdeI, and the released DNA insert was replaced by a fragment derived from pSVL-mLIF-RFP cut with the same enzymes. In the same fashion, mLIFR(D3–D5)-mgp130(D2–D3) was cloned using pSVL-mLIFR(D3–D5)-hgp130(D2–D3) and the restriction enzymes XmaI and SalI. For the stable expression of mLIFR(D1–D5) and mLIF-RFP in Hek293 Flp-In T-Rex expression cell lines (see below), the constructs were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO that contains a doxycycline-inducible cytomegalovirus promoter (Invitrogen). Constructs and primers used for cloning are as follows: pSVL-mLIFR(D1–D3)-hgp130(D2–D3), primers 1–4; pSVL-mLIFR(D3)-hgp130(D2–D3), primers 5–8; pSVL-mLIFR(D1–D5)-hgp130(D2–D3), primers 9 and 10; pSVL-mLIFR(D2–D4)-hgp130(D2–D3), primers 5, 6, 11, and 12; pSVL-mLIFR(D3–D5)-hgp130(D2–D3), primers 5, 6, 7, and 12; pSVL-mLIFR(D1–D5), primers 9 and 15; pSVL-mLIFR(D1–D3)-mgp130(D2–D3), primers 15 and 16; pSVL-mLIFR(D3)-mgp130(D2–D3), primers 15 and 16; pSVL-mLIF-RFP = pSVL-mLIFR(D1–D5)-mgp130(D2–D3), primers 14 and 15; pcDNA5/FRT/TO-mLIF-RFP, primers 17 and 18.

Cytokines, Cytokine Receptors—Human and murine LIF was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA) and murine OSM from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human IL-6 was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified as described (22Arcone R. Pucci P. Zappacosta F. Fontaine V. Malorni A. Marino G. Ciliberto G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The specific activity of IL-6 was measured in the B9 cell proliferation assay (23Aarden L.A. De Groot E.R. Schaap O.L. Lansdorp P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). sIL-6Rα was expressed in insect cells and purified as described previously (24Weiergräber O. Hemmann U. Küster A. Müller-Newen G. Schneider J. Rose-John S. Kurschat P. Brakenhoff J.P. Hart M.H. Stabel S. Heinrich P.C. Eur. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 234: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cell Culture of MEF and COS-7 Cells and Transfection of COS-7 Cells—COS-7 simian monkey kidney cells (kindly provided by I. M. Kerr, Cancer Research UK, London) and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (kindly provided by B. Neel, Boston) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with GlutaMAX™-I, 4.5 g/liter glucose and pyruvate (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Cytogen, Princeton, NJ), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Cambrex BioScience, Verviers, Belgium). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere in 5% CO2. Plasmids were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture and Transfection of HepG2 Cells—HepG2 human hepatoma cells (purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12 1:1 mix with GlutaMAX™-I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere in 5% CO2. Plasmids were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Cell Lysates, SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and Immunodetection—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids (pSVL) coding for the respective LIF inhibitor and grown for 48 h to allow protein production. Subsequently cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 15% glycerol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were analyzed with SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodetection using a 1:1,000 diluted antibody directed against the FLAG tag (Sigma). Coimmunoprecipitation Studies—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids (pSVL) coding for the respective LIF inhibitor and grown for 48 h to allow protein production. Afterward cell supernatants were harvested and cleaned by centrifugation and sterile filtration. For immunoprecipitation the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a FLAG-specific antibody (Sigma), which was previously immobilized to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) through a mouse antibody (Dako, Hamburg, Germany). The next day, the Sepharose with precipitated LIF inhibitors was centrifuged and incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 50 nm human LIF or murine LIF to allow coimmunoprecipitation. Proteins were eluted from the Sepharose with 2× Laemmli buffer and analyzed with SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodetection using a 1:1,000 diluted antibody directed against human LIF (Biodesign, Saco, ME) or murine LIF (Sigma). After stripping the membrane in stripping buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 76 μl of β-mercaptoethanol per 10 ml) for 25 min at 70 °C, a second immunodetection was performed using a FLAG antibody. Generation of Stable HEK293 Flp-In T-Rex Expression Cell Lines for the Production of LIF-RFPs—For production of the LIF inhibitors, the Flp-In T-Rex protein expression system (Invitrogen) was used. The generation of stable HEK293 Flp-In T-Rex expression cell lines for LIF inhibitors was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, HEK293 Flp-In T-Rex host cells were cotransfected with 3.6 μg of the plasmid pOG44 (Invitrogen) coding for the Flp-In recombinase and 0.4 μg of the plasmid pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) containing the coding sequence for the desired LIF inhibitor. Cotransfection was carried out by using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection stably transfected cell were selected with 50–200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Perbio/HyClone, Logan, UT). Single clones were expanded and treated with 10 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma) for 24 h without serum and hygromycin B to induce protein production. The supernatants were cleaned by centrifugation and sterile filtration, and the production of the respective LIF-RFP was checked by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodetection using a FLAG antibody. Concentration of LIF-RFPs—After doxycycline treatment, supernatants of the respective HEK293 Flp-In T-Rex expression cells were harvested, cleaned by centrifugation and sterile filtration, and concentrated about 20-fold using Vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience AG, Hannover, Germany). The same was done with supernatants from control HEK293 Flp-In T-Rex cells, which were stably transfected with an empty vector. ELISA-based Binding Assay—ELISA plates with a polystyrene surface (Nunc) were coated with mLIF (50 ng/well) overnight. Blocking of free binding sites was carried out using PBS supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin and 10% fetal calf serum for 30 min. After three washing steps with 250 μl of PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20, the wells were incubated with varying concentrations of the indicated FLAG-tagged LIF inhibitor or control supernatant and a FLAG antibody (20 ng/well, Sigma) for 3.5 h. The plates were washed three times with 250 μl of PBS/Tween and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (20 ng/well) for 30 min. After three washing steps the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed color reaction was initiated using a 0.1 m sodium acetate solution, pH 5.5, containing 100 μg/ml tetramethylbenzidine and 0.003% H2O2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 m H2SO4. The absorption was measured with an ELISA reader. All incubation steps were carried out at room temperature. STAT3 Tyrosine Phosphorylation in MEF Cells—For investigation of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, MEF cells were grown on 6-well plates (9.6 cm2/well) and stimulated for 20 min with hLIF, mLIF, hIL-6/shIL-6Rα, or mOSM or the combination of cytokine and LIF-RFP in the absence of serum. Subsequently, the cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (see above). The lysates were analyzed with SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodetection using an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine (705)-STAT3 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) or STAT3 (H190, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Both antibodies were used in a 1:1,000 dilution. Reporter Gene Assay in HepG2 Cells—HepG2 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates (9.6 cm2/well) and transiently cotransfected with pGL3-α2M-Luc (construct with luciferase gene regulated by the STAT3-responsive α2-macroglobulin promoter) and pCRTM3-lacZ (β-galactosidase construct with a constitutively active promoter; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were stimulated with either 5 ng/ml hLIF and an appropriate volume of control supernatant (see above) or the combination of hLIF and mLIFR(D1–D5) for 16 h at molar ratios indicated. Preparation of cellular lysates and luciferase measurements were carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase activity values were normalized to the transfection efficiency that was determined as β-galactosidase activity. The experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the mean values and standard deviations were calculated. SOCS3 mRNA Levels in MEF Cells—MEF cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and stimulated with either 5 ng/ml mLIF and an appropriate volume of control supernatant or the combination of mLIF and mLIF-RFP for 30 min at the molar ratios indicated. Subsequently, mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The SOCS3 and GAPDH mRNAs were amplified with the One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) utilizing sequence-specific primers and analyzed with gel electrophoresis. Primers for RT-PCR are as follows: mouse SOCS3, 5′-GGGTG GCAAA GAAAA GGAG-3′ and 5′-GTTGA GCGTC AAGAC CCAGT-3′; mouse GAPDH, 5′-ACCAC AGTCC ATGCC ATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCAC CACCC TGTTG CTGTA-3′ (25Ogata H.

Design and Expression of Different Fusion Proteins of LIFR and gp130 as Potential LIF Inhibitors—The potential human and murine LIF inhibitors were designed to contain the minimal parts of LIFR and gp130 required for high affinity LIF binding. Because the domains of LIFR necessary for LIF binding are controversially discussed, we constructed six possible inhibitors for human LIF containing the proposed domains of mLIFR needed for LIF binding (Fig. 1A). The five receptor fusion constructs for the inhibition of hLIF contain the CBM (D2–D3) of human gp130, which was shown to be sufficient for LIF binding (12Boulanger M.J. Bankovich A.J. Kortemme T. Baker D. Garcia K.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of hgp130 in a human LIF inhibitor containing mLIFR, we constructed the LIF inhibitor mLIFR(D1–D5) consisting of D1–D5 of mLIFR, which was lacking the CBM (D2–D3) of human gp130 and the linker. Accordingly, five potential murine LIF inhibitors were constructed by fusing the respective part of the mLIFR to the CBM of murine gp130. The two receptor fragments in the fusion proteins were connected by flexible linkers. For technical reasons, a FLAG tag was added to the C termini of all constructs. The potential human (Fig. 1B) and murine (Fig. 1C) LIF inhibitors were expressed in COS-7 cells, the lysates of which were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodete"
