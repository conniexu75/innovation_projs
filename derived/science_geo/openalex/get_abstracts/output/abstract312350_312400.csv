https://openalex.org/W2016254491,"A correlation of time with depth has been evaluated for the Camp Century, Greenland, 1390 meter deep ice core. Oxygen isotopes in approximately 1600 samples throughout the core have been analyzed. Long-term variations in the isotopic composition of the ice reflect the climatic changes during the past nearly 100,000 years. Climatic oscillations with periods of 120, 940, and 13,000 years are observed."

https://openalex.org/W2063742444,"Fine scale measurements of the vertical temperature profile in an Arctic water column show the presence of several cascaded isothermal layers. Layers between the depths of 300 anid 350 meters range from 2 to 10 meters in thickness, while the temperature change between adjacent layers is approximately 0.026 degrees C. The individual layers are isothermal to within +/- 0.001 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1965044534,"Individual heads of two species of reef or herinatypic coral, Solenastrea hyades (Dana) and Siderastrea siderea (Ellis and Solander), occur on rock outcrops on the inner continental shelf off North Carolina in waters where winter bottom temperatures are as low as 10.6 degrees C. These temperatures are significantly lower than previously assumed minimum temperatures for the survival of tropical reef corals in their natural environment."

https://openalex.org/W2014441712,"Recoils from alpha-particle decay of naturally occurring radioactive nuclides have energies between 70 and 169 kiloelectron volts. It is shown that these alpha recoils register tracks in mica, observable as etch pits, with an efficiency of about 80 percent. When the recoil energy is degraded to 40 kiloelectron volts the efficiency drops to 50 percent. But, since the decay of each thorium or uranium impurity atom in natural mica is followed by a cascade of six or eight alpha particles, the overall registration efficiency must be very nearly 100 percent."

https://openalex.org/W2076074350,"Measurements made by the moon-orbiting spacecraft Explorer 35 during 1967-1968 show that it is unlikely that the alpha-particle emissivity of the moon is greater than 0.064 per square centimeter per second per steradian and exceedingly unlikely that it is greater than 0.128, these values being respectively 0.1 and 0.2 of the provisional estimates made by Kraner et al. in 1966. This result implies that the abundance of uranium-238 in the outer crust (approximately a few meters thick) of the moon is much less than that typical of the earth's lithosphere, though it is consistent with the abundance of uranium-238 in terrestrial basalt or in chondritic meteorites."

https://openalex.org/W2062359303,"The gravity at the landing site of the first lunar-landing mission has been determined to be 162,821.680 milligals from data telemetered to earth by the lunar module on the lunar surface. The gravity was measured with a pulsed integrating pendulous accelerometer. These measurements were used to compute the gravity anomaly and radius at the landing site."
