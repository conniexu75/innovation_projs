https://openalex.org/W1996311210,"Avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses cause severe disease in humans1,2, but the basis for their virulence remains unclear. In vitro and animal studies indicate that high and disseminated viral replication is important for disease pathogenesis3,4,5. Laboratory experiments suggest that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation may contribute to disease severity6,7,8,9. To assess the relevance of these findings for human disease, we performed virological and immunological studies in 18 individuals with H5N1 and 8 individuals infected with human influenza virus subtypes. Influenza H5N1 infection in humans is characterized by high pharyngeal virus loads and frequent detection of viral RNA in rectum and blood. Viral RNA in blood was present only in fatal H5N1 cases and was associated with higher pharyngeal viral loads. We observed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died, and these correlated with pharyngeal viral loads. Genetic characterization of H5N1 viruses revealed mutations in the viral polymerase complex associated with mammalian adaptation and virulence. Our observations indicate that high viral load, and the resulting intense inflammatory responses, are central to influenza H5N1 pathogenesis. The focus of clinical management should be on preventing this intense cytokine response, by early diagnosis and effective antiviral treatment."

R. eutropha H16 first attracted biotechnological interest nearly 50 years ago with the realization that the organism's ability to produce and store large amounts of poly[R-(–)-3-hydroxybutyrate] and other polyesters could be harnessed to make biodegradable plastics. Here we report the complete genome sequence of the two chromosomes of R. eutropha H16. Together, chromosome 1 (4,052,032 base pairs (bp)) and chromosome 2 (2,912,490 bp) encode 6,116 putative genes. Analysis of the genome sequence offers the genetic basis for exploiting the biotechnological potential of this organism and provides insights into its remarkable metabolic versatility."

Elevated levels of circulating FFAs are associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Here we show that GPR84, a previously orphan G protein-coupled receptor, functions as a receptor for medium-chain FFAs with carbon chain lengths of 9-14. Medium-chain FFAs elicit calcium mobilization, inhibit 3′,5′-cyclic AMP production, and stimulate [35S]guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding in a GPR84-dependent manner. The activation of GPR84 by medium-chain FFAs couples primarily to a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o pathway. In addition, we show that GPR84 is selectively expressed in leukocytes and markedly induced in monocytes/macrophages upon activation by lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, we demonstrate that medium-chain FFAs amplify lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 p40 through GPR84. Our results indicate a role for GPR84 in directly linking fatty acid metabolism to immunological regulation.

GPCRs contain seven transmembrane domains and are activated by a wide variety of ligand types, including light, ions, amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, peptides, and proteins. In addition to about 250 characterized receptors, over 100 human genes encode proteins that belong to this family of receptors but for which ligands and functions remain to be determined (1Fredriksson R.

GPR84 is an orphan GPCR originally isolated using an expressed sequence tag data mining strategy (14Wittenberger T. Schaller H.C. Hellebrand S. J. Mol.

Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 1045-1052PubMed Google Scholar). No close homologs of GPR84 could be identified, although GPR84 is distantly related to monoamine receptors. Expression analysis revealed significant induction of GPR84 in monocytes/macrophages upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, suggesting that medium-chain FFAs may regulate inflammatory responses through activation of GPR84. Cloning and Cell Culture—Human and mouse GPR84 were cloned by PCR from human and mouse bone marrow cDNA (Clontech), respectively. Sequence-confirmed cDNAs were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Purified human monocytes (AllCells) and THP-1 and RAW264.7 cells (ATCC) were incubated with 100 ng/ml LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4) before harvesting for RNA preparation. All cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. CHO-GPR84 stable cells were generated by transfecting CHO cells with N-terminal-FLAG-tagged human GPR84 and subsequently were selected in 1 mg/ml G418 (Cellgro). All compounds used in this study were purchased from Sigma. Aequorin Assay—CHO cells were transiently transfected with GPR84 and aequorin reporter (Euroscreen) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) (5He W. Miao F.J. Lin D.C. Schwandner R.T. Wang Z.

Ligand-induced calcium mobilization, as indicated by an increase in aequorin luminescence, was recorded over a period of 20 s with a Microlumat luminometer (Berthold). Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 1 h on ice. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-rhodamine secondary antibody for an additional 30 min. Images were captured with a charge-coupled device digital camera connected to a Leica DC500 microscope. Flow Cytometry Analysis—CHO-GPR84 and CHO-Vector cells were stained with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% sodium azide for 1 h at 4°C. After extensive washing, cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody (Caltag). Flow cytometry analysis was carried out using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Cyclic AMP Assay—CHO-GPR84 and CHO-Vector cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. Cells were stimulated in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with compounds for 20 min before treatment with 10 μm forskolin for a further 20 min at 37 °C. A cyclic AMP (cAMP) assay was performed with the cAMP-Screen system (Applied Biosystems). When indicated, 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (Calbiochem) was incubated with the cells for 16 h. GTPγS Binding Assay—CHO-GPR84 and CHO-Vector cells were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cellular debris. Membrane fractions were collected by spinning the supernatant at 38,000 × g for 30 min and resuspending the pellet in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2. 25 μg of membranes was incubated at room temperature for 1 h in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 160 mm NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) containing 10 μm GDP and 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of compounds. Reactions were terminated by vacuum filtration through GF/B filters, and the retained radioactivity was quantified on a liquid scintillation counter. Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-mediated PCR (Q-RT-PCR) Analysis—Total RNA from human or mouse tissues (Clontech) and human immune cells (AllCells, LLC) were treated with DNase I (Ambion) before reverse transcription. Q-RT-PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector using TaqMan PCR core reagents (Applied Biosystems). Ratios of GPR84 to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase message RNA were calculated using a ΔΔCt method (Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). The primer and probe sequences for human GPR84 were: forward, TTCAGCCCTTCTCTGTGGACA; reverse, TGCAGAAGGTGGCACCG; probe, 5′-FAM-CTACCTCCACCTGCACTGGCGCABHQ-3′. Primer and probe sequences for mouse GPR84 were: forward, GACCAATACGGGCTGCATCAGG; reverse, CAGGCATGGCTTCTTGTGT; probe, 5′-FAM-AGCATCCGCTCTCATCAGGTGGCT-BHQ-3′. Primer and probe sequences for mouse interleukin-12 p40 subunit were: forward, AGACCCTGCCCATTGAACTG; reverse, GAAGCTGGTGCTGTAGTTCTCATATT; probe, 5′-FAM-CGTTGGAAGCACGGCAGCAGAA-BHQ-3′. Cytokine Secretion—RAW264.7 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Compounds were added 1 h before LPS (final concentration 100 ng/ml). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 21 h, and supernatants were collected for cytokine assay. Untreated cells were used as controls. Cytokine concentrations were determined using the Bio-Plex cytokine assay system (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. Data were analyzed with Bio-Plex Manager 2.0 software with 4- and 5-parameter curve fitting. To search for natural ligands for orphan GPCRs, we tested a collection of biochemical intermediates for their ability to evoke an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) using the aequorin assay (16Stables J. Green A. Marshall F. Fraser N. Knight E. Sautel M. Milligan G. Lee M. Rees S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding human GPR84, aequorin reporter, and a mixture of small G proteins (Gα16, Gqs5, Gqo5, and Gqi9). These promiscuous and chimeric small G proteins have been reported to convert the signaling pathways of non-Gq-coupled GPCRs to calcium mobilization (18Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 19Coward P. Chan S.D. Wada H.G. Humphries G.M. Conklin B.R. Anal.

Sci. 1996; 17: 235-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Capric acid (decanoic acid, C10:0) evoked an increase of [Ca2+]i, with a medium effective concentration (EC50) of 48 μm, in cells expressing human GPR84 (Fig. 1A). A similar response was observed for undecanoic acid (C11:0) (Fig. 1A). Control cells did not respond to capric acid or undecanoic acid (Fig. 1A). Neither capric acid nor undecanoic acid activated any of ∼40 other GPCRs (data not shown). To investigate the G protein specificity of GPR84, CHO cells were transfected with plasmids encoding human GPR84 and individual small G proteins and tested in aequorin assay. The chimeric G protein Gqi9 significantly potentiated the activation of GPR84 by capric acid, whereas the Gqs5 chimera did not (Fig. 1B), suggesting that GPR84 may signal through a Gi/o pathway. The murine ortholog of GPR84 shares 85% amino acid identity with human GPR84. Similarly, medium-chain FFAs (capric acid, undecanoic acid, and lauric acid) activated murine GPR84 in the presence of Gqi9 chimera (Fig. 1C). CHO cells stably expressing N-terminally FLAG-tagged human GPR84 (CHO-GPR84) were generated. Immunofluorescence staining of nonpermeabilized CHO-GPR84 cells revealed prominent plasma membrane localization of GPR84 protein (Fig. 2A). The cell surface expression of GPR84 was further confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B). Medium-chain FFAs inhibited forskolin-stimulated 3′,5′-cAMP production dose-dependently in CHO-GPR84 cells (Fig. 3A). The EC50 values for nonanoic acid, capric acid, undecanoic acid, and lauric acid were 52, 4, 8, and 9 μm, respectively. FFAs had no effects on cAMP concentrations in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). FFA-induced inhibition of cAMP production was blocked completely by preincubating cells with pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of Gi/o proteins (Fig. 3B). In addition, medium-chain FFAs stimulated [35S]GTPγS incorporation in membranes prepared from CHO-GPR84 cells (Fig. 4A), an effect that was also abolished by pertussis toxin treatment (Fig. 4B). In the [35S]GTPγS binding assay, the EC50 values for capric acid, undecanoic acid, and lauric acid were 5, 9, and 10 μm, respectively. The short-chain FFA acetic acid and long-chain FFA docosahexaenoic acid were inactive at GPR84 (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained in cAMP and [35S]GTPγS assays using independent CHO clones stably expressing GPR84 (data not shown). Medium-chain FFAs were unable to promote cAMP production in CHO-GPR84 cells in the absence of forskolin, suggesting that GPR84 does not signal through a Gs-mediated pathway (data not shown). GPR84 is unlikely to couple to a Gq pathway, because medium-chain FFAs did not induce calcium mobilization in the absence of co-transfected chimeric G proteins (Fig. 1B), nor did they stimulate inositol phosphate accumulation in cells expressing GPR84 (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that GPR84 activation by medium-chain FFAs couples primarily to a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o pathway. The potency of various FFAs at GPR84 examined in the cAMP and [35S]GTPγS binding assays are summarized in Table 1. Importantly, we found no evidence of GPR84 activation by short-chain FFAs, long-chain saturated FFAs, or long-chain unsaturated FFAs (Table 1). Our studies demonstrate that GPR84 functions as a specific receptor for medium-chain FFAs of C9 to C14 in length, with C10-C12 being the most potent.TABLE 1Potency of various fatty acids at GPR84 examined in the cAMP and [35S]GTPγS binding assaysEC50aEC50, which indicates the concentration of a compound that produces 50% of the maximal response, was calculated from dose-response curves.

In human, high levels of GPR84 expression were detected in the bone marrow and, to a lesser extent, in the peripheral leukocytes and the lung (Fig. 5A). In mouse, GPR84 mRNA was expressed mainly in the bone marrow, with transcripts also detected in the spleen, the lymph node, and the lung (Fig. 5B). The expression profile of GPR84 is notably different from that of GPR40, a pancreatic islet-specific GPCR activated by medium- and long-chain FFAs (6Briscoe C.P. Tadayyon M. Andrews J.L. Benson W.G.

Additionally, GPR84 expression was increased in purified human monocytes upon LPS activation (Fig. 6B). Moreover, GPR84 mRNA levels were markedly up-regulated by LPS treatment in the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and the mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (Fig. 6, C and D), suggesting that GPR84 may play a pivotal role in monocyte/macrophage activation and host immune response. A small molecule GPR84 surrogate agonist (21Takeda S. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Matsumura E. Nose E. Kogure K. Kojima S. Haga T. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), diindolylmethane, activated GPR84 with greater potency than the natural ligand capric acid (Fig. 7). The EC50 values for diindolylmethane in the cAMP and [35S]GTPγS binding assays were 0.7 and 0.5 μm, respectively, versus 4.5 and 4.6 μm for capric acid. Diindolylmethane was therefore used as a tool compound, along with medium-chain FFAs, to investigate the effect of GPR84 activation on cytokine secretion. Capric acid, undecanoic acid, and lauric acid dose-dependently increased the secretion of interleukin-12 p40 subunit (IL-12 p40) from LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 8A). Similar results were observed with diindolylmethane, suggesting that this effect is mediated through GPR84 activation (Fig. 8A). The up-regulation of IL-12 p40 mRNA by GPR84 agonists was further confirmed by Q-RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 8B). No effect on IL-12 p40 was observed in the absence of LPS (Fig. 8C). Among more than 20 cytokines analyzed (data not shown), IL-12 p40 was uniquely induced by GPR84 agonists (capric acid, undecanoic acid, lauric acid, and diindolylmethane) in the presence of LPS. The short-chain FFAs (acetic acid and propionic acid) and long-chain FFA (docosahexaenoic acid) exhibited no stimulatory activity (Fig. 8). Taken together, our results indicate that medium-chain FFAs amplify LPS-stimulated production of IL-12 p40 through GPR84. In the current study, we have shown that the previously orphan GPCR, GPR84, functions as a specific receptor for medium-chain FFAs of C9 to C14 length, with capric acid (C10:0), undecanoic acid (C11: 0), and lauric acid (C12:0) being the most potent agonists. Medium-chain FFAs activated GPR84 in aequorin assays in the presence of Gqi chimeric G proteins. Medium-chain FFAs inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP production and stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding in a GPR84-dependent manner. Our results also suggest that GPR84 activation by medium-chain FFAs is coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o pathway. In the past few years, several GPCRs have been identified as receptors for FFAs. GPR41 and GPR43 can be specifically activated by short-chain FFAs (7Brown A.J. Goldsworthy S.M. Barnes A.A.

The identification of GPR84 as an immune cell-specific receptor for FFAs adds to the repertoire of GPCRs that can be activated by FFAs, strengthening the importance of FFAs as signaling molecules in regulating diverse pathophysiological functions. The plasma concentration of FFAs in the postabsorptive state is ∼0.5 mm and can be substantially increased after ingestion of a fatty meal (23Jump D.B. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2004; 41: 41-78Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Most of the circulating FFAs are bound with serum albumin such that the concentration of unbound FFAs is in the micromolar range (24Spector A.A. Hoak J.C. Science. 1975; 190: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The EC50 values for medium-chain FFAs capric acid, undecanoic acid, and lauric acid at GPR84 (∼4, 8, and 9 μm, respectively, in the cAMP assay) are then within range of their physiological concentrations and are comparable with their potencies at GPR40 (∼43 and 6 μm for capric acid and lauric acid, respectively) (6Briscoe C.P.

Although both can be activated by medium-chain FFAs, GPR84 and GPR40 exhibit clear differences in ligand preference, G protein coupling, and expression profiles. GPR84 is activated by medium-chain FFAs of C9 to C14 in length, with C10:0, C11:0, and C12:0 being the most potent. Short-chain FFAs and long-chain FFAs are inactive at GPR84. In contrast, GPR40 is promiscuously activated by medium- and long-chain saturated and unsaturated FFAs (6Briscoe C.P. Tadayyon M. Andrews J.L. Benson W.G. Chambers J.K. Eilert M.M. Ellis C.

The differential localization of GPR84 and GPR40 suggests that they respond to FFAs in a tissue-specific manner and mediate distinct effects of FFAs. FFAs are known to exert diverse actions on various tissues (25Nunez E.A. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1997; 57: 107-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Sperling R.I. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1998; 57: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Hwang D. Annu.

Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of circulating FFAs are associated with obesity, dyslipidemia and diabetes (30Eckel R.H. Grundy S.M. Zimmet P.Z. Lancet. 2005; 365: 1415-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4993) Google Scholar). Although an increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and infiltration of monocytes/macrophages into the adipose tissues have been reported in obese patients (31Boden G. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d169-d175Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Dandona P. Aljada A. Bandyopadhyay A. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 4-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which FFAs exert their effects on immune cells has not been precisely defined. The specific and abundant expression of GPR84 in monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils suggests a role of medium-chain FFAs in modulating leukocyte functions and host defense, providing a potential link between the obesity-related metabolic syndrome and the proinflammatory state with which it is closely associated. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-12 plays a pivotal role in promoting cell-mediated immunity to eradicate pathogens by inducing and maintaining T helper 1 (Th1) responses and inhibiting T helper 2 (Th2) responses (33Scott P. Science. 1993; 260: 496-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 34Hsieh C.S. Macatonia S.E. Tripp C.S. Wolf S.F. O'Garra A. Murphy K.M.

Nature. 1994; 368: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). FFAs may affect pathogen elimination processes by inducing IL-12 p40 through GPR84. Moreover, IL-12-driven Th1 reactions have deleterious consequences in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Medium-chain FFAs, through their direct actions on GPR84, may affect Th1/Th2 balance and could provide a link between metabolic disorders and autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, consistent with IL-12 p40 induction by GPR84, GPR84-deficient T cells exhibited increased production of Th2 cytokines (36Venkataraman C. Kuo F. Immunol. Lett. 2005; 101: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the functions of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils, the primary sites of GPR84 expression, are altered in a GPR84-deficient state, particularly in response to medium-chain FFAs. GPR84-deficient mice will be valuable for dissecting the signaling functions of FFAs. In summary, we have identified medium-chain FFAs as ligands for the orphan receptor GPR84. We have also shown that GPR84 is highly expressed in immune cells and markedly induced in monocytes/macrophages by LPS. In addition, the activation of GPR84 in monocytes/macrophages amplifies LPS-stimulated IL-12 p40 production. The identification of GPR84 as a leukocyte-specific receptor for FFAs provides a novel mechanism directly linking FFAs metabolism to innate and adaptive immunity, highlighting the importance of FFAs as signaling molecules in regulating a myriad of biological processes.

https://openalex.org/W1969649798,"Perturbations to the Wnt signaling pathway have been implicated in a large proportion of human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Activating β-catenin mutations and loss of function mutations in Axin1 are thought to be functionally equivalent. We examined the Wnt pathway in HCC by comparing the expression of β-catenin target genes and the level of β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation, in 45 HCC tumors and four cell lines. Among these samples, β-catenin and AXIN1 were mutated in 20 and seven cases, respectively. We found a significant correlation between activated β-catenin mutations and overexpression of mRNA for the target genes glutamine synthetase (GS), G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR)49 and glutamate transporter (GLT)-1 (P=0.0001), but not for the genes ornithine aminotransferase, LECT2, c-myc and cyclin D1. We also showed that GS is a good immunohistochemical marker of β-catenin activation in HCC. However, we observed no induction of GS, GPR49 or GLT-1 in the five inactivated Axin1 tumors. β-Catenin-dependent transcriptional activation in two Axin1-mutated HCC cell lines was much weaker than in β-catenin-mutated cell lines. Our results strongly suggest that in HCC, contrary to expectation, the loss of function of Axin1 is not equivalent to the gain of function of β-catenin. Our results also suggest that the tumor suppressor function of Axin1 in HCC may be related to another, non-Wnt pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2082240332,"VEGFR-2 is the major receptor that regulates the different functions of VEGF in adults. We have previously reported that following VEGF treatment of endothelial cells, VEGFR-2 is phosphorylated on Tyr<sup>1214</sup> upstream of the Cdc42-SAPK2/p38-MAPKAP K2 pathway. However, little is known of the earliest molecular events that compose the SAPK2/p38 pathway following VEGFR-2 activation. In this study, we address this question using HA-tagged constructs of either wild-type VEGFR-2 or Y1214F VEGFR-2 mutant in immunoprecipitation assays. We show that the Src family kinase member Fyn, but not c-Src itself, is recruited to VEGFR-2 and is activated in a p∼Tyr<sup>1214</sup>-dependent manner. We also report that the SH2 domain-containing adapter molecule Nck, but not Grb2, is recruited to VEGFR-2 in ap∼Tyr<sup>1214</sup>-dependent manner and that it associates with Fyn. Moreover, PAK-2 is phosphorylated in a Fyn-dependent manner. Using chemical and genetic inhibitors, we show that Fyn activity is required for SAPK2/p38 but not for FAK activation in response to VEGF. In contrast, c-Src permits activation of FAK, but not that of SAPK2/p38. In addition, Fyn is required for stress fiber formation and endothelial cell migration. We propose a model in which Fyn forms a molecular complex with Nck and PAK-2 and suggest that this complex assembles in a p∼Tyr<sup>1214</sup>-dependent manner within VEGFR-2 following VEGF treatment. In turn, this triggers the activation of the SAPK2/p38 MAP kinase module, and promotes stress fiber formation and endothelial cell migration."

MMPs are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that selectively degrade or remodel most of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components of gastric mucosa including collagen, and other structural molecules (22Egeblad M.

Increasing evidence in in vitro systems suggest that H. pylori infection stimulates gastric epithelial cells to produce MMPs either directly or indirectly via cytokine synthesis (30Krueger S.

Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2001; 281: G823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that H. pylori induced inflammation in the gastric tissues is associated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and appears to be triggered partly by genes located in the cag PAI, which have been demonstrated in different animal models (14Blaser M.J.

The possibility that cag PAI directly regulate gastric damage has not been rigorously examined. cag+ H. pylori are presumed to cause gastric mucosal damage by translocation of Cag A protein (40Odenbreit S. Puls J. Sedlmaier B. Gerland E. Fischer W. Haas R. Science. 2000; 287: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar), which in turn induces MMPs in response to pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. Conversely, long term infection by cag PAI-deficient H. pylori cause gastric damage in mice (20Thompson L.J. Danon S.J. Wilson J.E. O'Rourke J.L. Salama N.R. Falkow S. Mitchell H. Lee A. Infect.

Although there are reports describing the association between the presence of cag PAI and progression of gastric disease (13Covacci A. Censini S. Bugnoli M. Petracca R. Burroni D. Macchia G.

Bull. 1998; 54: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the pathogenic role of cag PAI is not yet completely understood. To better understand mechanisms by which H. pylori induce gastric damage, we compared cag+ and cag- strains for tissue injury and MMP-9 secretion in mice and in cultured cells. Keeping in mind the possibility that Indian H. pylori strains might differ from Western strains most studied to date, we screened 50 strains from endoscopic samples of ulcer patients in Kolkata to find a naturally occurring cag- strain. Here we report that Indian strain AM1 (cag-) and reference strain SS1 (cag+) each damages mouse gastric tissues during infection and augments production of MMP-3. Also, each strain markedly increases secretion and synthesis of pro-MMP-9 and to a lesser extent increases active MMP-2 activity at the level of secretion and synthesis both in mice and in cultured cells. The up-regulation of pro-MMP-9 by H. pylori is directly associated with down-regulation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 expression and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. We hypothesize that initial stages of infection by both cag- and cag+H. pylori may propagate through a common pathway and that process responses to pro-inflammatory signals for MMP-9 up-regulation. H. pylori Strains and Culture—Two unrelated mouse-adapted H. pylori strains were used: SS1 (19Lee A. O'Rourke J. De Ungria M.C. Robertson B. Daskalopoulos G. Dixon M.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1386-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 44Nolan K.J. McGee D.J. Mitchell H.M. Kolesnikow T. Harro J.M. O'Rourke J. Wilson J.E. Danon S.J. Moss N.D. Mobley H.L. Lee A. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and AM1 (Indian strain). SS1 is much used as the standard mouse-adapted strain for experimental infection (The Sydney Strain). The strain AM1 was isolated from an endoscopic sample of an ulcer patient in Kolkata, India as mixed infections. Both strains of H. pylori were grown on brain-heart infusion agar (BHI; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) supplemented with 7% sheep blood, 0.4% isovitalex, and the antibiotics amphotericin B (8 μg/ml), trimethoprim (5 μg/ml), and vancomycin (8 μg/ml) (referred to here as BHI agar). Nalidixic acid (10 μg/ml), polymyxin B (10 μg/ml), and bacitracin (200 μg/ml) were added to this medium when culturing H. pylori from mouse stomachs. The plates were incubated at 37 °C under 5% O2, 10% CO2, 85% N2. In all experiments, overnight grown cultures on BHI agar plates were used. DNA Methods—Chromosomal DNA was extracted from different H. pylori strains to characterize the genotype. Chromosomal DNA was prepared by the CTAB (hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide) extraction method (45Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar), from confluent BHI agar plate cultures. The H. pylori 26695 strain was used as a control in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Specific PCR was carried out in 20-μl reaction volumes using 10 pmol of each primer per reaction, 0.25 mm of each dNTP, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Takara, Shuzo, Japan), and 10 ng of DNA (from both a pool of colonies and single colony isolates) in a standard PCR buffer (Takara). PCR was carried out for 30 cycles of: (i) denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, (ii) primer template DNA annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and (iii) DNA synthesis at 72 °C for a time based on expected fragment size (1 min/kb). The presence or absence of the cag PAI was scored by PCR with specific primers (Table 1) using DNA from different cultured strains. After amplification, 3 μl of each reaction mixture was separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel, and the amplified gene products were visualized under uv light after staining with ethidium bromide. DNA markers were obtained from New England Biolabs.TABLE 1Details of PCR primers used for analysis of vacA alleles, cagA, and cag PAI empty site in SS1 and AM1 strains of H. pyloriLocus namePrimer pairsSequenceAmplicon sizebpvacA s1/s2VA1-F5′-ATGGAAATACAACAAACACAC-3′259/286VAI-R5′-CTGCTTGAATGCGCCAAAC-3′vacA m1/m2VAG-F5′-CAATCTGTCCAATCAAGCGAG-3′567/642VAG-R5′-GCGTCAAAATAATTCCAAGG-3′cagAcag5c-F5′-GTTGATAACGCTGTCGCTTCA-3′350cag3c-R5′-GGGTTGTATGATATTTTCCATAA-3′cag PAI empty siteLuni15′-ACATTTTGGCTAAATAAACGCTG-3′550R52805′-ACATTTTGGCTAAATAAACGCTG-3′ Open table in a new tab H. pylori Infection in C57BL/6 Mice—C57BL/6 mice bred inhouse with free access to food and water were used in all experiments. Experiments were designed to minimize animal suffering and to use the minimum number associated with valid statistical evaluation. Animals were anesthetized by ketamine (12 mg/kg b.w.) followed by cervical dislocation for killing. Animal experiments were carried out following the guidelines of the animal ethics committee of the institute. Animals of both control and experimental groups were kept separately under standard controlled conditions and were fasted for 6 h with free access to water before each inoculation. Mouse infection was done using a modification of the Lee et al. (19Lee A. O'Rourke J. De Ungria M.C. Robertson B. Daskalopoulos G. Dixon M.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1386-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) method. Briefly, overnight grown bacterial cultures were harvested in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Groups of mice (12 mice per group) were intragastrically inoculated by orogastric gavage twice in a period of 3 days with about 108 CFU/mouse/inoculation. Groups of mice inoculated with SS1, AM1, heat-killed bacteria, or PBS were kept separately with free access to water and food. One day after final inoculation (3 days post-primary inoculation), half of the mice from each group were fasted for 6 h, and then sacrificed. The other half from each group was sacrificed 9 days later (13 days post-primary inoculation). Histology—The body and the pyloric parts of control and 10-day infected mouse stomach were sectioned for histological studies. The tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. The sections (5 μm) were cut using microtome, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (26Swarnakar S. Ganguly K. Kundu P. Banerjee A. Maity P. Sharma A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9409-9415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and assessed under an Olympus microscope (1 × 70). Images were captured using Camedia software (E-20P 5.0 Megapixel) at original magnification 10 × 10, 20 × 10, and 40 × 10 and processed in Adobe Photoshop version 7.0. Tissue Extraction—The body and the pyloric parts of stomach were suspended in PBS containing protease inhibitors (Sigma), minced, and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected as PBS extracts. The pellet was then extracted in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to obtain Triton X-100 extracts. Both PBS and Triton X-100 extracts were preserved at -70 °C for future studies. A small part of the stomach was minced in PBS followed by low speed centrifugation, and the supernatant was used for bacterial culture. Bacterial colonization was scored by quantitative culture. Gelatin and Casein Zymography—For assay of MMP-9 and -2 activities, tissue extracts were electrophoresed in a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma), under non-reducing conditions. The gels were washed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and then incubated in calcium assay buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2) for 18 h at 37 °C. For assay of MMP-3 activity, tissue extracts were electrophoresed in casein gel instead of gelatin. Gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue followed by destaining (46Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The zones of gelatinolytic or caseinolytic activity came as negative staining. Standard MMP-9 and MMP-2 enzymes were purchased from Chemicon, Hampshire, UK. H. pylori-infected human gastric tissue extract was used as MMP-3 standard. Quantification of zymographic bands was done using densitometry linked to proper software (Lab Image). Western Blotting—Tissue extracts (100 μg/lane) were resolved by 10% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (47Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature in 3% bovine serum albumin solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.02% Tween 20 (TBST) followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C in 1:200 dilution of the respective primary antibodies in TBST containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were washed five times with TBST and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1.5 h. The bands were visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate solution (Sigma). Polyclonal mouse reactive anti-MMP-9, anti-MMP-3, anti-TIMP-1, anti-IL-6, anti-TNF-α, and monoclonal human reactive anti-MMP-9 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, while monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody and polyclonal mouse reactive anti-IL-1β were obtained from Sigma. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)—Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Complementary DNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction buffer using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) with an oligo(dT)15 primer (Invitrogen). The cDNA (1 μl) was then amplified in a 20-μl reaction buffer for 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 30 s), annealing (58 °C for 30 s), and extension (72 °C for 60 s) using the following primers: for MMP-9, sense, 5′-GACCCGAAGCGGACATTGTCAT-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGAATGATCTAAGCCCAGTGCAT-3′, (expected product 755 bp); for MMP-2, sense, 5′-ATGGCTTCCTCTGGTGCTC-3′ and antisense, 5′-TCGTAGTGGTTGTGGTTGC-3′ (expected product 385 bp); for MMP-3, sense, 5′-GGATTGTGAATTATACACCGGAT-3′ and antisense, 5′-GGATAACCTGCTAGCTCCTCGT-3′ (expected product 769 bp); and for GAPDH, sense, 5′-TGGGGTGATGCTGGTGCTGAG-3′, and anti-sense, 5′-GGTTTCTCCAGGCGGCATGTC-3′, (expected product 497 bp). The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. PCR product sizes were estimated by 100-bp marker (Invitrogen) in each case. The real time RT-PCR was used for quantitative detection of MMP-9 gene in AM1 and SS1 H. pylori-infected gastric tissues. The reaction was carried out in a 20-μl final volume with the iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions containing 50 ng of cDNA, 10 pmol of each primer, and SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan). Polymerase activation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 50 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. A quantitative measure of MMP-9 was obtained through amplification of GAPDH and MMP-9 cDNA in each sample using the same PCR conditions. The amount of MMP-9 expression relative to the total amount of cDNA was calculated as ΔCt = CtGAPDH - Ct MMP-9. The changes of MMP-9 expression in AM1- or SS1-infected samples compared with that of control were expressed as ΔΔCt = ΔCtcontrol - ΔCtAM1 or SS1 where CtMMP-9 and CtGAPDH were the fractional cycle number at which fluorescence generated by reporter dye exceeds the fixed level above baseline for MMP-9 and GAPDH cDNA, respectively. The relative expression of MMP-9 gene in the AM1 or SS1 strain of H. pylori-infected samples was calculated as 2ΔΔCt. Each sample was run three times. Cell Culture and H. pylori Infection—The human gastric epithelial cells (AGS) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and antibiotics/antimycotics at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 (31Crawford H.C.

Twenty-four hours before infection, cells were transferred into 6-well polypropylene tissue culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). For coculture experiments, viable H. pylori strains AM1 and SS1 grown separately in BHI agar plates were harvested in PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in antibiotic-free and FBS-free media to a concentration of 1 × 109 colony-forming units/ml and were immediately incubated with the AGS cell line. For all experiments, H. pylori were infected to cells at 80% confluence at a bacteria/cell concentration of 100:1 (48Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. Mays D.J. Forsyth M.H. Cover T.L. Song S.Y. Krishna U.

Nuclear localization signal(s), (NLS(s)), of the 61 kDa parafibromin remain to be defined. Utilization of computer-prediction programmes, identified five NLSs (three bipartite (BP) and two monopartite (MP)). To investigate their functionality, wild-type (WT) and mutant parafibromin constructs tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein or cMyc were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, or human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, and their subcellular locations determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Western blot analyses of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from the transfected cells were also performed. WT parafibromin localized to the nucleus and deletions or mutations of the three predicted BP and one of the predicted MP NLSs did not affect this localization. In contrast, deletions or mutations of a MP NLS, at residues 136–139, resulted in loss of nuclear localization. Furthermore, the critical basic residues, KKXR, of this MP NLS were found to be evolutionarily conserved, and over 60% of all parafibromin mutations lead to a loss of this NLS. Thus, an important functional domain of parafibromin, consisting of an evolutionarily conserved MP NLS, has been identified."

Here we demonstrate that Alix in WI38 cells, which require Alix expression for maintaining typical fibroblast morphology, associates with filamentous actin (F-actin) and F-actin-based structures lamellipodia and stress fibers. Reducing Alix expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreases F-actin content and inhibits stress fiber assembly. In cell-free systems, Alix directly interacts with F-actin at both the N-terminal Bro1 domain and the C-terminal proline-rich domain. In Alix immunoprecipitates from WI38 cell lysates, actin is the most abundant partner protein of Alix. In addition, the N-terminal half of the middle region of Alix binds cortactin, an activator of the ARP2/3 complex-mediated initiation of actin polymerization. Alix is required for lamellipodial localization of cortactin. The C-terminal half of the middle region of Alix interacts with α-actinin, a key factor that bundles F-actin in stress fibers. Alix knockdown decreases the amount of α-actinin that associates with F-actin. These findings establish crucial involvement of Alix in actin cytoskeleton assembly.

These morphological properties are determined by coordinated actin cytoskeleton assembly, integrin-mediated cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix assembly (1Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar).

Dysregulation of any of these processes may cause alterations in fibroblast morphology, as often observed in transformed fibroblasts (6Pawlak G. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 7Kahn P. Heller D. Shin S. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1983; 36: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8Labat-Robert J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Critical regulators of these processes are often identified by their ability to alter fibroblast morphology when their expression levels are increased or decreased. Alix/AIP1 (ALG-2 interacting protein X or 1) is the mammalian ortholog of an evolutionally conserved family of adaptor proteins (9Sadoul R. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our investigation of biological functions of human Alix, which was originally identified by us and named Hp95 (10Wu Y. Pan S. Luo W. Lin S.H. Kuang J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6801-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Wu Y. Pan S. Che S. He G. Nelman-Gonzalez M. Weil M.M. Kuang J. Differentiation. 2001; 67: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), has revealed its critical roles in regulating fibroblast morphology. In immortalized mouse fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells that are less flattened and aligned than their nonimmortalized counterparts, overexpression of Alix promoted cell flattening and alignment, whereas reduction of Alix expression produced opposite effects (10Wu Y. Pan S. Luo W. Lin S.H. Kuang J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6801-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Alix overexpression also promoted cell flattening and monolayer growth in malignant HeLa cells (11Wu Y. Pan S. Che S. He G. Nelman-Gonzalez M. Weil M.M. Kuang J. Differentiation. 2001; 67: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because cell morphology is determined by coordinated actin cytoskeleton assembly, integrin-mediated cell adhesions, and extracellular matrix assembly, these findings indicate that Alix plays structural or regulatory roles in some of these processes. Functional studies of Alix and its orthologs have generated the consensus that Alix is positively involved in apoptotic induction (9Sadoul R. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Wu Y. Pan S. Luo W. Lin S.H. Kuang J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6801-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Vito P.

Structurally, Alix and its orthologs are characterized by an N-terminal Bro1 domain, a middle region, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD). The Bro1 domain, named after the first identified ortholog of this family, yeast Bro1, was originally predicted by computer program-based sequence analysis and thought to consist of the N-terminal 160 amino acid residues. Recent x-ray crystallography of bacterially produced fragments of Bro1 suggested that the N-terminal 380 residues (called broad Bro1 domain) are required to form a structurally stable domain for partner protein interaction (17Kim J. Sitaraman S. Hierro A. Beach B.M. Odorizzi G. Hurley J.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The middle region contains coiled-coil motif, potential sites for additional partner protein interaction (15Luhtala N. Odorizzi G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The PRD contains multiple polyproline motifs, which are potential docking sites for proteins containing SH3 domains. The apoptotic function of Alix requires its interaction with the calcium-binding protein ALG-2 at the PRD (12Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol.

The role of Alix in endosomal sorting requires binding the ESCRT-III component CHMP4b at the broad Bro1 domain and the ESCRT-I component TSG101 at the PRD (21Strack B. Calistri A. Craig S. Popova E.

These functions of Alix do not seem to link to the effect of Alix on fibroblast morphology. Besides these well established functions of Alix, Alix coimmunoprecipitated with epidermal growth factor receptor, multiple cytoskeletal proteins, including actin and focal adhesion kinases in crude lysates of rat astrocytes (24Schmidt M.H. Chen B. Randazzo L.M. Bogler O. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although the physical nature or the functional implication of these associations was not determined in this study, these observations raised the possibility that Alix is a component of the transmembrane protein network that orchestrate coordinated actin cytoskeleton assembly, integrin-mediated cell adhesions, and extracellular matrix assembly. To explore this possibility, we used nonimmortalized WI38 cells derived from human lung fibroblasts as the model system to determine where in the transmembrane protein network Alix performs functions that regulate cell morphology. Here we report that Alix associates with actin cytoskeleton and promotes its assembly. Production of Recombinant Proteins—cDNAs that encode full-length and truncated Alix were generated by PCR using the Alix cDNA clone obtained in our previous studies as the template (11Wu Y. Pan S. Che S. He G. Nelman-Gonzalez M. Weil M.M. Kuang J. Differentiation. 2001; 67: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PCR primers for full-length and truncated Alix are listed in supplemental Table S1. PCR products were digested with BamHI and NotI restriction enzymes and inserted into the BamHI and NotI sites of the pGEX-4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). To express recombinant proteins from these cDNAs, BL-21 Escherichia coli cells were transformed with produced cDNA constructs and induced at ∼0.6 of A600 with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h. The induced cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.35 m NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 200 μg/ml lysozyme, 5 mm benzamidine (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin (Roche Applied Science). The cells were then lysed by sonication, and the cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 40 min. To purify the recombinant proteins, the cleared cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C on rotation. The resins were then column-washed with 20-bed volumes of 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Tween 20, and 1 mm DTT in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Following the wash, recombinant proteins on the beads were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in PBS and stored in 20% glycerol at -70 °C. To produce GST-tagged Alix or Alix fragments by in vitro transcription and translation, cDNAs encoding these recombinant proteins were amplified from their bacterial expression vectors by PCR with the forward primer 5′-atttaggtgacactatagaagcgagccaccatggcccctatactaggttattg-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ccgggagctgcatgtgtcagaggttttc-3′. These PCR products were transcribed directly using mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ SP6 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Proteins were produced from the RNA products by in vitro translation using reticulocyte lysates by in vitro translation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Production and Characterization of Anti-Alix Monoclonal Antibodies—Balb/c mice were immunized with purified GST-Alix. Two weeks after immunization, blood samples were obtained from the tail of the immunized mice and tested for titers against GST-Alix by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. Spleens from the mice that showed the highest titers were removed, and their splenocytes were fused with the mouse myeloma cell line SP2/0. Culture supernatants from individual hybridoma clones were then screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting against GST-Alix. To produce antibodies from different hybridoma clones, the clones were seeded in stationary bioreactors in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% low IgG fetal bovine serum from HyClone (Logan, UT). The bioreactor fluids were collected every 3 days, and IgG fractions were affinity-purified using protein G-agarose columns (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The concentrations of purified IgG were determined by their absorbance at A280. Cell Culture and Transfection—WI38 cells, derived from human lung fibroblasts, were obtained from ATCC and cultured in regular culture dishes in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (Invitrogen) that was supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) unless otherwise indicated. WI38 cells were not immortalized, and the 19th to 30th generations were used in this study. Two Alix-specific siRNAs and one green fluorescence protein (GFP)-specific siRNA were designed and synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Alix-specific siRNA sequences were 5′-gagaagaaauugcaagguu-3′ and 5′-gaaggaugcuuucgauaaa-3′. The GFP-specific siRNA sequence was 5′-ggcuacguccaggagcgcacc-3′. Transfection of siRNA was performed essentially as described previously (25Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar). In brief, 2.5 × 105 WI38 cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes and grown for 24 h. Each plate of cells was then transfected with 4 μl of 50 nm siRNA mixed with Lipofectamine-2000 purchased from Invitrogen following the manufacturer's instruction. The transfected cells were either continuously cultured or subcultured at 24 h after the transfection at 104 cells per new dish. Cell morphologies were observed after 48 and 72 h by phase contrast microscopy, and digital images were taken at ×40 magnifications by Olympus IX81 microscope (Olympus America Inc. Melville, NY) using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—For testing the immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation efficiencies of anti-Alix antibodies, WI38 cells were scraped from culture dishes in ice-cold RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 150 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin (Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 30 min. For testing interactions between Alix and cortactin and α-actinin, WI38 cells were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin. Collected cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and protein concentrations of supernatants were determined by using a DC protein assay kit purchased from Bio-Rad. Immunoprecipitation of WI38 cell lysates was performed by incubation of 40 μl of crude cell lysates (∼40 μg of total proteins) with 2 μg of specific antibody immobilized onto 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then washed six times with 500 μl of lysis buffer and were eluted by boiling in 5 bed volumes of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted following the procedure as we described previously (26He G. Siddik Z.H. Huang Z. Khokhar A.R. Kuang J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2929-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-cortactin and anti-Myc antibodies and monoclonal anti-α-actinin and anti-CDK4 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunofluorescence Staining—WI38 cells were cultured on 22-mm glass coverslips placed in a 35-mm culture dish. In some experiments, the glass coverslips were pre-coated at 4 °C overnight with 20 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma). After indicated time of culture, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and blocked for 1 h with 10% horse serum (Invitrogen) in PBS. Fixed cells were first incubated for 1 h with 1 μg/ml anti-Alix antibody diluted in 5% horse serum in PBS, followed by three washes with PBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:200 in 3% horse serum in PBS. After three washings, cells were mounted with anti-fade (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and images were captured by the Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging system (Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc., Thornwood, NY) using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices Corp.). For co-staining with antibody and phalloidin, after the final wash, cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml phalloidin-TRITC (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min and rinsed in PBS before mounting. For immunofluorescence staining with two antibodies, a mixture of the two antibodies was used as the primary antibody. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) were used to detect monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, respectively. For cytochalasin D treatment, WI38 cells were cultured on 22-mm glass coverslips for 24 h, and the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 5 μm of cytochalasin D (Sigma). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed three times with PBS. Cells were then fixed and stained with phalloidin-TRITC following the same procedure described above. GST Pulldown Assays—5 μg of purified GST or GST-tagged Alix or truncated Alix recombinant proteins were absorbed onto 5 μl of glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were then incubated at 4 °C for 6 h with WI38 cell lysates (prepared in lysis buffer composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin) containing ∼50 μgof total proteins. The beads were washed eight times with the lysis buffer plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and eluted with 40 μl of SDS sample buffer. Eluted polypepetides were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-cortactin or anti-α-actinin antibodies. To test Alix binding to G-actin, GST or GST-Alix absorbed glutathione-agarose beads were incubated at 4 °C overnight with 5 μg of purified non-muscle actin (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) dissolved in 40 μl of G-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm CaCl2). The beads were washed eight times with G-buffer plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm DTT and eluted with 40 μl of SDS sample buffer. Eluted polypeptides were resolved in parallel with nonabsorbed actin by 10% SDS-PAGE, transblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-actin antibodies. F-actin Cosedimentation—F-actin cosedimentation assay was performed on Alix in WI38 cell lysates or GST-Alix recombinant proteins using the non-muscle actin-binding protein biochem kit specifically designed for this assay (Cytoskeleton). All the samples were pre-cleared by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h before the assay. Quantitation of Coomassie Blue-stained polypeptides in the supernatant and pellet was performed by analyzing scanned images with NIH Image 1.62 as described previously (10Wu Y. Pan S. Luo W. Lin S.H. Kuang J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6801-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by the curve fitting software PRIZM when indicated (version 3; GraphPad Software, San Diego). Separation of G-actin and F-actin in WI38 Cell Lysates—F-actin and G-actin in WI38 cell lysates was separated using a procedure described previously (27Yates-Siilata K.E. Dahms T.E. Webster R.O. Heuertz R.M. Cell Biol. Int. 2004; 28: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 28Banan A. Zhang Y. Losurdo J. Keshavarzian A. Gut. 2000; 46: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, WI38 cells were transfected with control or Alix siRNA. 48 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized, and 1 × 105 cells were re-plated into 35-mm dishes and cultured for an additional 3 h. Cells were then lysed in plate with 250 μl of actin stabilization buffer (0.1 m PIPES (pH 6.9), 30% glycerol, 5% Me2SO, 1 mm MgSO4,2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin) and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. Lysed cells were scraped out of the plate and ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C in Beckman TLA100.1 ultracentrifuge rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The supernatant was collected and used as the G-actin fraction. The pellet was dissolved in 250 μl of lysis buffer supplemented with 5 μm cytochalasin D (Sigma) and used as the F-actin fraction. Equal percentages of the G-actin and F-actin fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies that recognize actin, cortactin, or α-actinin. Proteomic Analysis of Polypeptides in the Alix Complexes— 5 μg of equally mixed 1A12, 1F7, 2H12, and 3A9 antibodies that were immobilized onto 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose were incubated with 2 ml of WI38 cell lysates containing ∼2 mg of total proteins at 4 °C overnight and washed six times with RIPA buffer. The immunocomplexes were then eluted with 80 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. After the gels were silver-stained, all visualized polypeptides that had been specifically precipitated by anti-Alix antibodies were excised and digested at 37 °C overnight with 100 ng of modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). After extraction and vacuum concentration, samples were analyzed with LC-MS/MS on an electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ DecaXP, Thermo, San Jose, CA). The following aqueous solvent system was used: solvent A contained 2% acetonitrile with 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B consisted of 20% 2-propanol, 60% acetonitrile, and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid. The solvents were purchased from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI), and trifluoroacetic acid was acquired from Pierce. The gradient was ramped from 5% solvent B to 60% solvent B over 40 min using an Ultimate pump (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). Tandem mass spectra were subjected to data base searches using Mascot for trypsin and semi-trypsin enzyme specificities and allowing for methionine oxidation and as many as two missed cleavages. Alix Is Required for WI38 Cells to Maintain Typical Fibroblast Morphology—Our previous investigation of the function of Alix in immortalized mouse fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells revealed roles of Alix in regulating fibroblast morphology. To determine whether this applies to the model system chosen for this study, we transfected WI38 cells with siRNA against either Alix or GFP (used as a negative control) and examined the effect of Alix knockdown on WI38 cell morphology. Immunoblotting of crude cell lysates with anti-Alix monoclonal antibodies generated by us showed that Alix expression decreased by 3-4-fold in Alix siRNA-transfected cells at 24 h and became hardly detectable at 48-96 h after the transfection, whereas actin expression did not decrease. In contrast to Alix siRNA-transfected cells, control transfected cells expressed constant levels of both Alix and actin (Fig. 1A). Parallel observation of the morphology of the transfected cells without a subculture revealed that Alix knockdown cells formed fewer membrane protrusions and looked blunter than control cells, although overall cell shapes were similar (Fig. 1B, upper panel). When control and Alix siRNA-transfected cells were first subcultured and then examined, the effect of Alix knockdown on cell morphology became more dramatic (Fig. 1B, lower panel) despite their comparable rates of cell growth and death (data not shown). These results indicated that Alix is required for WI38 cells to maintain typical fibroblast morphology. Alix Associates with Actin Cytoskeleton in WI38 Cells—To investigate the role of Alix in the transmembrane network that regulates fibroblast morphology, we first determined the subcellular localization of Alix in WI38 cells in relation to F-actin-based structures with 1A12, 1F7, and 3A9 anti-Alix monoclonal antibodies and the F-actin-specific agent phalloidin (29Wulf E. Deboben A. Bautz F.A. Faulstich H. Wieland T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4498-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 30Lengsfeld A.M. Low I. Wieland T. Dancker P. Hasselbach W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2803-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These three antibodies were chosen because each efficiently immunoblotted and immunoprecipitated Alix in crude lysates of WI38 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). We observed that each of the three antibodies stained F-actin-based structures as well as free standing particles, which were probably endosomes based on previously established functions of Alix in endosomal sorting. In contrast, none of the antibodies stained structures at the cell periphery that assumed the shape of focal adhesions. As representatives, 3A9 antibody stained both protruding lamella at the cell edge and circumvential actin bundles at the base of the lamella in newly seeded cells that were spreading (Fig. 2A). In well spread cells, 3A9 antibody stained lamellipodia and stress fibers (Fig. 2B). When we cultured WI38 cells on fibronectin-coated substrata, which greatly enhanced stress fiber assembly, Alix almost quantitatively localized at stress fibers (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrated that Alix associates with actin cytoskeleton in WI38 cells. Alix Knockdown Inhibits Actin Cytoskeleton Assembly in WI38 Cells—To determine whether Alix has functions in actin cytoskeleton assembly, we transfected WI38 cells with control or Alix-specific siRNA and stained cells with phalloidin, which stains both F-actin that has been assembled into high order structures and short F-actin scattered in the cytoplasm (31Verderame M.

Clearly, the F-actin staining was universally weaker in Alix knockdown cells than in control cells. The difference was best illustrated by concurrent staining of the majority of Alix siRNA-transfected cells and the few nontransfected cells in the same field (Fig. 3A). However, no change was observed in the protein level of actin (Fig. 1A). Treatment of WI38 cells with the F-actin depolymerization agent cytochalasin D reduced the overall staining by phalloidin as well (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that Alix knockdown inhibits F-actin formation in WI38 cells. In support of this conclusion, when crude lysates of control and Alix knockdown WI38 cells were fractionated into F-actin-containing and G-actin-containing fractions, the F-actin:G-actin ratio in control cells was ∼3-fold higher than that in Alix knockdown cells (Fig. 3C). In addition to the negative effect of Alix knockdown on the F-actin content, Alix knockdown cells also assembled less stress fibers than control cells, especially in central areas of the cell. This difference was most obvious when ce"

https://openalex.org/W2089006987,"Loss of the metastasis suppressor gene, KiSS-1 has been strongly correlated to the progression of metastases in numerous types of cancers. The mechanism through which KiSS-1 is lost during metastasis, however, is still not completely known. Previous studies have shown that genetic material on human chromosome 6q16.3–q23 is essential for KiSS-1 expression in normal tissues. Additionally, microcell-mediated transfer of this chromosome in cancerous tissue results in rescued expression of KiSS-1 and reduced metastatic phenotype. Here, we show that loss of Sp1-coactivator protein DRIP-130, which is encoded by human chromosome 6q16.3–q23, results in reduced KiSS-1 promoter activation in highly malignant melanoma cells. Co-expression of Sp1 and DRIP-130 not only rescues KiSS-1 expression, but also induces an inhibition of the invasive and migratory behavior in highly metastatic melanoma cells, similar to the overexpression of KiSS-1 metastasis suppressor gene in those cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KiSS-1 expression is regulated by Sp1 elements within the first 100-bp region of the KiSS-1 promoter and that targeted deletion of a single GC-rich region spanning −93 to −58 interrupts Sp1- and DRIP-130-modulated transcriptional control of KiSS-1 expression. Our results thus suggest that DRIP-130 is a key regulator in KiSS-1 transactivation in normal tissue, and that the loss of DRIP-130 expression, as a result of the gross loss of human chromosome 6q16.3–q23, provokes increased tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1984363689,"The transcriptional modulator SnoN controls a diverse set of biological processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. The mechanisms by which SnoN regulates these processes remain incompletely understood. Recent studies have shown that SnoN exerts positive or negative regulatory effects on transcription. Because post-translational modification of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) represents an important mechanism in the control of the activity of transcriptional regulators, we asked if this modification regulates SnoN function. Here, we show that SnoN is sumoylated. Our data demonstrate that the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme Ubc9 is critical for SnoN sumoylation and that the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 selectively interacts with and enhances the sumoylation of SnoN. We identify lysine residues 50 and 383 as the SUMO acceptor sites in SnoN. Analyses of SUMO “loss-of-function” and “gain-of-function” SnoN mutants in transcriptional reporter assays reveal that sumoylation of SnoN contributes to the ability of SnoN to repress gene expression in a promoter-specific manner. Although this modification has little effect on SnoN repression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter and only modestly potentiates SnoN repression of the p21 promoter, SnoN sumoylation robustly augments the ability of SnoN to suppress transcription of the myogenesis master regulatory gene myogenin. In addition, we show that the SnoN SUMO E3 ligase, PIAS1, at its endogenous levels, suppresses myogenin transcription. Collectively, our findings suggest that SnoN is directly regulated by sumoylation leading to the enhancement of the ability of SnoN to repress transcription in a promoter-specific manner. Our study also points to a physiological role for SnoN sumoylation in the control of myogenin expression in differentiating muscle cells.

In recent years, the c-ski novel related (sno) gene products have garnered much interest in developmental and cancer biology. SnoN, a sno gene alternatively spliced product, is a protein of ∼80 kDa that is expressed in diverse vertebrate species, including human, mouse, and chicken (1Liu X. Sun Y. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Luo K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). SnoN shares a 100-amino acid homology region at its N terminus with the related proteins c-Ski and Dach (3Wilson J.J. Malakhova M. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Hegde R.S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of SnoN has a coiled-coiled predicted structure that promotes SnoN-SnoN or SnoN-c-Ski dimerization (4Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cohen S.B. Zheng G. Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). SnoN localizes mainly in the nucleus where it interacts with different transcriptional factors and coregulators to control gene expression (1Liu X. Sun Y. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Luo K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). SnoN regulates a diverse set of biological processes. SnoN is amplified in several tumors, including melanomas, breast, and esophageal carcinomas (6Zhang F. Lundin M. Ristimaki A. Heikkila P. Lundin J. Isola J. Joensuu H. Laiho M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5005-5010PubMed Google Scholar, 7Edmiston J.S. Yeudall W.A. Chung T.D. Lebman D.A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4782-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consistent with the interpretation that amplified SnoN exerts oncogenic effects, overexpression of SnoN in fibroblasts induces malignant transformation and anchorage-independent growth (8Boyer P.L. Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Hughes S.H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 457-466PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cohen S.B. Nicol R. Stavnezer E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2505-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, disruption of the sno gene has revealed that SnoN expressed at its physiological levels may paradoxically exert tumor-suppressive properties in cells (10Shinagawa T. Dong H.D. Xu M. Maekawa T. Ishii S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2280-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Sno+/– heterozygote mice have higher rates of spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors as compared with the wild-type controls (10Shinagawa T. Dong H.D. Xu M. Maekawa T. Ishii S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2280-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, sno+/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts display increased rates of cell proliferation as compared with the wild-type control (10Shinagawa T. Dong H.D. Xu M. Maekawa T. Ishii S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2280-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These results support the idea that SnoN exerts distinct tumor-promoting or suppressor effects depending on the level of SnoN within the cells. At endogenous concentrations, SnoN may operate as a tumor suppressor, whereas overexpressed SnoN may stimulate neoplastic transformation. Whereas much of the emphasis on SnoN function has been on its role in cell proliferation and transformation, SnoN also has interesting functions in cell differentiation. In particular, SnoN appears to modulate the differentiation of skeletal muscle cells (2Luo K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 8Boyer P.L. Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Hughes S.H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 457-466PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mimura N. Ichikawa K. Asano A. Nagase T. Ishii S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, SnoN promotes the growth of axons in differentiated neurons (12Stegmüller J. Konishi Y. Huynh M.A. Yuan Z. DiBacco S. Bonni A. Neuron. 2006; 50: 389-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, the emerging picture is that SnoN acts as a versatile transcriptional modulator that affects different biological responses. As a result, there is great interest in elucidating the mechanisms that regulate SnoN function. To date, these mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Recent data have shown that SnoN may act via the transforming growth factor (TGF) 4The abbreviations used are: TGF, transforming growth factor; R-Smad, receptor-regulated Smad; co-Smad, common partner Smad4; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FBS, fetal bovine serum; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; HA, hemagglutinin; hpRNA, hairpin RNA. -β-Smad signaling pathways to regulate cellular responses (13Stroschein S.L.

The receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) subfamily and the common partner Smad4 (co-Smad4) play a major role in transducing the signal from the TGF-β cell surface receptors to the nucleus (16Shi Y.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, the ligand-phosphorylated-R-Smad in complex with co-Smad4 binds to Smad binding elements within promoters of TGF-β-responsive genes, and in collaboration with distinct transcriptional coregulators, promotes or blocks the transcription of these genes (19Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). For example, together with the transcriptional coactivators p300 and CREB-binding protein, the Smad complex induces gene expression (18Massagué J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar, 20Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). SnoN associates with the TGF-β-R-Smad2 and Smad3, as well as the co-Smad4 (13Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K.

Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, SnoN antagonizes the ability of TGF-β to induce transcription and inhibit cell proliferation supporting the idea that SnoN is a proto-oncogene (13Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 15Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 30540-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). SnoN inhibition of TGF-β-dependent transcription is thought to occur at least in part via SnoN recruitment of a histone deacetylase complex to promoters of TGF-β-responsive genes (15Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2822-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, we have recently found that, at physiological concentrations, SnoN mediates TGF-β-induced transcription and inhibition of cell proliferation in specific cells (24Sarker K.P. Wilson S.M. Bonni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13037-13046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that, under certain circumstances, SnoN activates rather than represses TGF-β-induced transcription. Interestingly, a number of transcriptional modulators, including MEF2A and the Smad interacting protein SIP1, can activate or repress transcription depending on the post-translational modification status of the protein. Sumoylation has emerged as a key modification in regulating transcription factors such as MEF2A, SIP1, and Sp3 that have both transcriptional activator and repressive functions (25Ross S. Best J.L. Zon L.I. Gill G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 26Sapetschnig A. Rischitor G. Braun H. Doll A. Schergaut M. Melchior F. Suske G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 27Long J. Zuo D. Park M. J. Biol.

In view of these observations, we reasoned that SnoN might also be regulated by protein sumoylation. Sumoylation of substrates occurs by the covalent attachment of the carboxyl group of the C-terminal glycine residue of SUMO to a lysine ϵ-amino group of the substrate (30Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Sumoylation of substrates is catalyzed by the SUMO-activating E1 enzyme Aos1/Uba2, the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme Ubc9, and a SUMO E3 ligase (30Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that SnoN is covalently modified by SUMO. Sumoylation of SnoN occurs at the distinct sites of lysines 50 and 383. The sumoylation of SnoN is stimulated by the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme Ubc9. In addition, we demonstrate that the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 interacts with and promotes SnoN sumoylation. The sumoylation of SnoN potentiates significantly the ability of SnoN to repress transcription in a promoter-specific manner. In particular, we find that sumoylation of SnoN enhances the ability of SnoN to regulate the promoter activity of a muscle-differentiating gene. Our data suggest that sumoylation may have relevance for SnoN function in cell differentiation. Together, these results suggest that sumoylation of SnoN represents a mechanism contributing to the functional diversity of SnoN. Plasmids—Mammalian expression plasmids (pCMV5B) containing cDNA encoding FLAG-tagged SnoN and Myc-tagged-SnoN proteins have been described previously (15Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2822-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FLAG-tagged PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASxα, and PIASy plasmids were generous gifts from Dr. Ke Shuai (University of California). CMV-based plasmids containing cDNA encoding mouse PIAS1 SUMO ligase mutant PIAS1 (C350S) protein, human SnoN sumoylation mutant proteins, SnoN (K50R), SnoN (K383R), and SnoN (K50/383R), were constructed using the PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method. To express a SUMO-SnoN fusion protein that is resistant to cleavage by the C-terminal SUMO hydrolases, SUMO1 lacking the C-terminal diglycine motif was amplified by PCR and cloned upstream of SnoN (25Ross S. Best J.L. Zon L.I. Gill G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The PIAS1 RNA interference vector pU6/pias1-EGFP encoding PIAS1 hairpin RNAs (PIAS1 hpRNA) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the U6 and CMV promoters, respectively, was generated using the pU6/EGFP vector by a previously described strategy (24Sarker K.P. Wilson S.M. Bonni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13037-13046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The PIAS1 RNA interference vector was designed to specifically target the 21-nucleotide region “CTATGCCTTATGACTTACAAG” in PIAS1 mRNA. This region displayed no significant homology to any other gene by BLAST search. The 3TP-lux luciferase reporter construct was described previously (31Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A.

Sampaio A.V. Ridgeway A.G. Underhill T.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2885-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and myogenin promoter (myogenin-p-lux) (33Beier F. Taylor A.C. LuValle P. J.

All constructs were confirmed by restriction digests and/or DNA sequence analyses (University of Calgary Core Sequencing Facility). Cell Lines and Transfections—Human kidney epithelial 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose and l-glutamine (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen). The human hepatoma HepG2 and the mink lung epithelial Mv1Lu cell lines were cultured in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) and 10% FBS. The mouse myoblast C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (growth medium). The 293T and HepG2 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method. The C2C12 and Mv1Lu cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Transfected cells were lysed using an established procedure (24Sarker K.P. Wilson S.M. Bonni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13037-13046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Macías-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Briefly, cells were lysed in TNTE buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described previously (24Sarker K.P. Wilson S.M. Bonni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13037-13046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) isopeptidase inhibitor or an equivalent volume of the vehicle where indicated was included in the lysis buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 10% of each supernatant was removed for protein determination and protein expression analyses. The remainder of the supernatant was subjected to mouse anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) or rabbit anti-SnoN (H-317, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) immunoprecipitations as described previously (36Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the case of double anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation, 90% of the immunocomplexes from the first immunoprecipitations were eluted in 1% SDS to denature proteins complexes. The eluates were diluted in lysis buffer to reduce the SDS concentration to 0.1% and subjected to a second anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (36Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The protein content of each cell lysate or immunoprecipitation sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Western blotting coupled to enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) using mouse anti-HA (16B2, Covance), mouse anti-FLAG, rabbit anti-SnoN, mouse anti-myogenin (F5D, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa), rabbit anti-Actin (Sigma), or mouse anti-GFP antibody (B34, Covance) as primary antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) as the secondary antibodies as described before (24Sarker K.P. Wilson S.M. Bonni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13037-13046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A VersaDoc 5000 Imager and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) were used to detect and quantify, respectively, the ECL signals. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well and 1 day later were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter constructs 3TP-lux, p21-lux, or myogenin-p-lux (0.1 μg/well), CMV-β-galactosidase vector (0.05 μg/well), and various SnoN, PIAS1, or PIAS1 RNA interference constructs as specified in the figure legends. In experiments involving the 3TP-lux and p21-lux reporters, 1 day post-transfection, cells were incubated in 0.2% FBS-containing medium in the presence or absence of 100 pm TGF-β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 16–18 h at 37 °C before lysing. For the myogenin-p-lux reporter study, C2C12 cells were maintained in 10% FBS containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium until 40 h post-transfection at which time myogenesis was initiated by incubating cells in 2% horse serum containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (differentiation medium) for 2–4 days before lysing. The cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (24Sarker K.P. Wilson S.M. Bonni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13037-13046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Arbitrary luciferase activity, expressed in relative light units, was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to control for variations in transfection efficiency. Each experimental condition was carried out in triplicates, and the data are presented as mean (±S.E.). Experiments were repeated on independent batches of cells at least three times. SnoN Is Modified by Sumoylation—SnoN has positive and negative transcriptional regulatory functions. However, the mechanisms by which SnoN produces these distinct transcriptional activities remain to be identified. Because sumoylation can influence the function of transcription factors, we considered the possibility that this modification may represent one mechanism that regulates the transcriptional function of SnoN. To test this idea, we first asked if SnoN can be conjugated to SUMO in cells. We expressed FLAG-tagged SnoN alone or together with HA-tagged SUMO in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Cell lysates prepared in the absence or presence of the general SUMO-protease inhibitor NEM were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibodies followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the HA tag. SUMO coexpression with SnoN in cells resulted in the appearance of NEM-sensitive slower mobility protein species in the SUMO blots of the SnoN immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 3 to 7). The SUMO immunoreactive protein bands were absent in the samples from cells expressing SnoN or SUMO alone (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). Two reproducible NEM-sensitive SUMO-conjugated protein species displayed apparent molecular masses of 100 and 120 kDa (SnoN is 80 kDa) (Fig. 1A, lane 7). Because SUMO-conjugated species have apparent molecular masses that exceed the unmodified substrate by ∼20 kDa or greater, our data suggest that the SUMO-conjugated protein bands in the SnoN immunocomplexes represent SUMO-conjugated forms of expressed SnoN (30Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar, 37Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 38Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 39Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Consistent with this conclusion, the slower mobility protein species were detected when SnoN immunocomplexes were immunoblotted with the SnoN antibody (see bottom panel of Fig. 1A). Our quantitative analysis indicated that on average the SUMO-modified SnoN represents ∼17% of the unmodified SnoN in HepG2 cells. This finding is consistent with the idea that only a small percentage of a given protein is sumoylated at steady state (40Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). This low stoichiometry is thought to reflect two possibilities that are mutually not exclusive: 1) fast kinetics of sumoylation and desumoylation, and 2) low stoichiometry is present in cells but can initiate a relatively stable repressive state (30Johnson E.S.

To determine if SnoN is sumoylated in other cell types, we followed the appearance of SUMO-conjugated proteins in FLAG-SnoN immunoprecipitates of lysates of the human kidney epithelial 293T and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged SnoN, HA-tagged SUMO, alone or together. In these experiments, lysates of transfected 293T cells were subjected to two sequential anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations, under native and denaturing conditions, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Coexpression of SUMO and SnoN in 293T (Fig. 1B) and HeLa (data not shown) cells led to the appearance of the NEM-sensitive 100- and 120-kDa SUMO-immunoreactive protein species in SUMO-immunoblots of SnoN immunocomplexes (Fig. 1, compare lane 7 of A to lane 2 of B, and data not shown). In addition, we found that these SUMO-conjugated protein species are present in SnoN immunoprecipitates of 293T lysates carried out under native (data not shown) or denaturing conditions (Fig. 1B) thus excluding the possibility that SUMO-conjugated proteins in the SnoN immunoprecipitation are SUMO-conjugated species of SnoN-interacting proteins. Taken together, our data suggest that SnoN undergoes post-translational modification by SUMO in cells. We next asked if endogenous SnoN can be modified by SUMO. We monitored the presence of SUMO-conjugated endogenous SnoN in lysates of 293T cells transiently transfected with the SUMO expression plasmid or its control vector. Expression of SUMO in these cells revealed two NEM-sensitive SUMO-conjugated SnoN protein species in endogenous SnoN immunoprecipitates of these cells. These results suggest that endogenous SnoN can be sumoylated in cells (Fig. 1C, upper panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). Immunoblotting of the SnoN immunoprecipitates with the SnoN antibody revealed the presence of the slower mobility NEM-sensitive protein bands with similar apparent molecular weight as compared with the SUMO-conjugated SnoN detected in the SUMO blot (Fig. 1C, refer to protein species labeled “SUMO-SnoN”in lane 2 of the upper and lower panels). Furthermore, SnoN immunoprecipitations of lysates of cells transfected with the control or the SUMO expressing vectors displayed these SnoN-immunoreactive higher molecular weight species (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 2 and 4 of lower panel) raising the possibility that endogenous SUMO content is sufficient to promote endogenous SnoN sumoylation in 293T cells. Results of similar experiments carried out in HepG2 and HeLa cells transiently transfected with control or SUMO encoding vectors further confirmed the presence of SUMO-conjugated SnoN protein bands in immunoprecipitates of endogenous SnoN (data not shown). These results indicate that endogenous SnoN is a target of the SUMO pathway. The SUMO Pathway Regulates SnoN Sumoylation—Sumoylation of substrates is mediated by the SUMO-conjugating pathway that consists of a cascade of three different enzymes (30Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). In the first step SUMO is activated in an ATP-dependent manner by the SUMO-activating E1 enzyme consisting of the Aos1/Uba2 heterodimer. Activated SUMO is then transferred to an active cysteine residue in the only known SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme termed Ubc9. The activated SUMO is then transferred from Ubc9 to lysine residues of specific substrates, a reaction that is catalyzed by a SUMO E3 ligase. A SUMO E3 ligase promotes sumoylation of distinct substrates through the SUMO ligase complexing with a specific substrate and Ubc9. To demonstrate that the SUMO pathway controls SnoN sumoylation, we first asked if the SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9 affects SnoN sumoylation in cells. We assessed SnoN sumoylation in NEM-treated lysates of 293T cells transiently coexpressing SUMO, SnoN, and a wild-type or a catalytically inactive mutant Ubc9 protein in which cysteine 93 is mutated into serine (42Bernier-Villamor V.

https://openalex.org/W2008481502,"Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) is an adaptor molecule that mediates apoptotic and inflammatory signals, and implicated in tumor suppression. However, the mechanism of ASC-mediated apoptosis has not been well elucidated. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of ASC-mediated apoptosis in several cell lines using a caspase recruitment domain 12-Nod2 chimeric protein that transduces the signal from muramyl dipeptide into ASC-mediated apoptosis. Experiments using dominant-negative mutants, small-interfering RNAs and peptide inhibitors for caspases indicated that caspase-8 was generally required for ASC-mediated apoptosis, whereas a requirement for caspase-9 depended on the cell type. In addition, caspase-like apoptosis-regulatory protein (CLARP)/Fas-like inhibitor protein, a natural caspase-8 inhibitor, suppressed ASC-mediated apoptosis, and Clarp−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts were highly sensitive to ASC-mediated apoptosis. Bax-deficient HCT116 cells were resistant to ASC-mediated apoptosis as reported previously, although we failed to observe colocalization of ASC and Bax in cells. Like Fas-ligand-induced apoptosis, the ASC-mediated apoptosis was inhibited by Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-XL in type-II but not type-I cell lines. Bid was cleaved upon ASC activation, and suppression of endogenous Bid expression using small-interfering RNAs in type-II cells reduced the ASC-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate that ASC, like death receptors, mediates two types of apoptosis depending on the cell type, in a manner involving caspase-8."
https://openalex.org/W2054562236,"Bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) is synthesized as a large precursor protein, which undergoes proprotein convertase-mediated proteolytic maturation along the secretory pathway to release the active ligand. Pro-BMP-4 is initially cleaved at a consensus furin motif adjacent to the mature ligand domain (the S1 site), and this allows for subsequent cleavage at an upstream motif (the S2 site). This sequential cleavage liberates a small, evolutionarily conserved, prodomain fragment (the linker peptide) of unknown fate and function. Here we show that the linker domain is essential for proper folding, exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, and thus cleavage of the BMP-4 precursor when overexpressed in Xenopus oocytes and embryos but not in cultured mammalian cells. Mature BMP-4 synthesized from a precursor in which the S1 site is non-cleavable, such that the linker domain remains covalently attached to the ligand, has little or no activity in vivo. Finally, analysis of folding, cleavage, and bioactivity of chimeric precursors containing the BMP-7 prodomain and BMP-4 mature domain, or vice versa, with or without the BMP-4 linker domain revealed that the linker domain is only functional in the context of the BMP-4 prodomain, and that differential cleavage around this domain can regulate the activity of a heterologous ligand.

Subsequently, BMP-4 was shown to be involved in a wide variety of biological processes including cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, and cell fate determination. BMP-4 has been established as a morphogen that plays essential roles during embryonic development (1Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). The mature BMP-4 ligand is a functional dimer harboring seven cystine residues, six of which are involved in intramolecular disulfide linkage, and the seventh of which is responsible for dimer formation (2McDonald N.Q. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 421-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), BMP-4 is synthesized as a large inactive precursor that is proteolytically cleaved following a multibasic motif (-RXKR-, termed the S1 site) to generate the active C-terminal ligand (3Aono A. Hazama M. Notoya K. Taketomi S. Yamasaki H. Tsukuda R. Sasaki S. Fujisawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Cleavage is carried out by specific member(s) of the proprotein convertase (PC) family of serine proteases (4Cui Y. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4735-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 5Constam D.B. Robertson E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The best characterized member of this family, furin, recognizes the preferred consensus sequence, -RX(K/R)R-, but can also cleave following the minimal sequence -RXXR-(6Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that BMP-4 undergoes a second cleavage at a minimal furin consensus motif (-RXXR-, the S2 site) located upstream of the S1 site within the prodomain (7Cui Y. Hackenmiller R. Berg L. Jean F. Nakayama T. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2797-2802PubMed Google Scholar). Paradoxically, although cleavage of pro-BMP-4 occurs sequentially (S1 and then S2), and the initial cleavage at the S1 site releases the mature ligand, subsequent cleavage at the S2 site regulates the activity and the signaling range of mature BMP-4 (7Cui Y. Hackenmiller R. Berg L. Jean F. Nakayama T. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2797-2802PubMed Google Scholar). In Xenopus embryos, BMP-4 synthesized from exogenous precursor in which the S2 site is non-cleavable is less active, signals over a shorter range and accumulates at lower levels than does BMP-4 cleaved from native precursor. Conversely, pro-BMP-4 in which the upstream site is mutated to an optimal furin motif is rapidly and simultaneously cleaved at both sites and this generates a ligand that is more active and signals over a greater range than does BMP-4 cleaved from native precursor. Biochemical analysis of Pro-BMP-4 maturation in Xenopus oocytes suggests that the precursor is first cleaved at the S1 site in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), at which stage the prodomain remains non-covalently associated with the mature ligand (8Degnin C. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5012-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This complex then traffics to a post-TGN compartment, where the more acidic environment unmasks and facilitates cleavage at the second site. S2 cleavage breaks the non-covalent association between mature BMP-4 and the prodomain, and the free ligand is stable and able to signal over long range. If cleavage at the S2 site does not occur, the prodomain/ligand complex is targeted to the lysosome for degradation. As a result, mature BMP-4 in complex with the prodomain signals only at short range, to nearby cells. Cleavage at the S2 site therefore determines how much BMP-4 is available for signaling. Analysis of mice carrying a point mutation that prevents S2 processing has shown that cleavage of the S2 site is essential for normal development and, more importantly, suggests that this site might be selectively cleaved in a tissue-specific fashion (9Goldman D.C. Hackenmiller R. Nakayama T. Sopory S. Wong C. Kulessa H. Christian J.L. Development. 2006; 133: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Specifically, these mice show severe loss of BMP-4 activity in some tissues, such as testes and germ cells, whereas other tissues that are sensitive to BMP-4 dosage, such as the limb, dorsal vertebrae, and kidney, develop normally. In a haploinsufficient background, inability to cleave the S2 site leads to embryonic and postnatal lethality because of defects in multiple organ systems. These data support the hypothesis that differential use of the S2 site provides a mechanism for tissue specific regulation of BMP-4 activity, although biochemical analysis of endogenous pro-BMP-4 cleavage products will be required to substantiate this theory. Sequential cleavage of pro-BMP-4 liberates a small prodomain fragment (the linker peptide) of unknown fate and function. Primary and upstream furin cleavage motifs are present in all known vertebrate BMP-2 and BMP-4 precursor proteins, and in their Drosophila ortholog, DPP (illustrated in Fig. 2A), and the primary amino acid sequence is more highly conserved across species within the linker domain than within the remainder of the prodomain. Thus, the linker domain may play an essential role in pro-BMP-4 maturation, possibly by providing the signals that direct intracellular trafficking of the cleaved ligand to either degradatory or secretory/recycling pathways. On the other hand, BMP-7 and other family members have only a single furin consensus site and lack a linker domain. This raises the possibility that this region functions merely as a spacer between the two cleavage sites in BMP-4 and is dispensable, or even inhibitory for ligand formation. Consistent with this possibility, a mutant form of pro-BMP-4 in which the linker domain is rapidly removed by simultaneous cleavage of the S1 and S2 sites is more active than that generated by sequential cleavage of the precursor, or by cleavage at the S1 site alone (7Cui Y. Hackenmiller R. Berg L. Jean F. Nakayama T. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2797-2802PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study we perform structure-function analyses to examine the role of the BMP-4 linker domain. Our results show that the linker domain functions in concert with upstream sequences within the prodomain to ensure proper folding and thus cleavage of pro-BMP-4. cDNA Constructs—A cDNA encoding Xenopus BMP-7 containing a FLAG tag in the prodomain was obtained from Dr. Ken Cho (10Hawley S.H. Wunnenberg-Stapleton K. Hashimoto C. Laurent M.N. Watabe T. Blumberg B.W. Cho K.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2923-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Sequence encoding a Myc epitope tag was inserted into the mature domain of BMP-7, 26 amino acids downstream of the cleavage site, using a PCR-based approach. cDNAs encoding HA- and Myc-tagged native and S1 cleavage mutant forms of pro-BMP-4 have been described previously (8Degnin C. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5012-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding deletion mutant and chimeric precursors were made using the splicing by overlap extension method (11Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho Z.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-536PubMed Google Scholar) or by PCR-mediated introduction of appropriate restriction sites. Embryo Culture and Manipulation—Xenopus eggs were obtained, embryos injected with synthetic capped RNA and cultured as described (12Moon R.T. Christian J.L. Technique. 1989; 1: 76-89Google Scholar). Embryonic stages are according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (13Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). For animal cap assays, RNA was injected near the animal pole of two-cell embryos, ectoderm was isolated at stages 8–9 and explants were cultured to stage 10.5. RNA Isolation and Analysis—Total RNA was isolated and Northern blots were hybridized with antisense riboprobes as described previously (14Christian J.L. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled bands were visualized with a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimager and quantified using the Macintosh IP lab gel program. Protein Expression in Oocytes—Oocytes (stage VI) were isolated, injected, and cultured as described earlier (8Degnin C. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5012-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The precursor and cleavage products were immunoprecipitated from oocyte lysates and/or culture media, by incubating with 12Ca5 (HA), M2 (FLAG), or 9E10 (Myc) antibodies along with protein A-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed and bound protein denatured by boiling in presence of 0.5% SDS with or without 1% β-mercaptoethanol followed by deglycosylation with endoglycosidase H (Endo H), or peptide: N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). Radiolabeled proteins were resolved on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, fixed in 15% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid, dried, and exposed either to a phosphorimager screen or Kodak Biomax MS film at –70 °C. Transient Transfection and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. BMP constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells by transient transfection of the plasmids harboring them (2 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were cultured for 60–70 h in OptiMEM. Proteins were precipitated from conditioned media using 10% trichloroacetic acid. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with protease inhibitors, cleared by centrifugation and protein estimated by BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were probed with anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies and immunoreactive proteins were detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). In Vitro Cleavage with Furin—[35S]Met/Cys labeled pro-BMP was synthesized using rabbit reticulocyte lysates and proteins immunoprecipitated using antibodies specific for the tags in the protein. Digestion was carried out using recombinant human furin at neutral pH (7.0) as described (8Degnin C. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5012-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All results were confirmed in a minimum of three independent cleavage reactions. Alkaline Phosphatase Assay—C2C12 myoblastic cells were plated in a 24-well plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium +10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were allowed to grow for 12–18 h. The medium was subsequently replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25% fetal bovine serum and 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) in the presence or absence of conditioned media from HEK cells transfected with cDNAs encoding wild type or linker deletion mutant BMP-4. After 48 h, cells were lysed by adding alkaline phosphatase extraction buffer containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 9, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mm MgSO4 with 10 μg/ml aprotinin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The dish was incubated at 4 °C with shaking for 30 min. Cleared lysate (0–150 μl) was incubated with 250 μl of substrate (1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate, Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction by stopped by adding 50 μl of 3 n NaOH per 200 μl of reaction mix, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. The Linker Domain Is Essential for Proper Folding and Cleavage of pro-BMP-4 in Vivo—To determine whether the highly conserved sequence between the S1 and S2 cleavage sites is required to generate functional BMP-4, a cDNA encoding an epitope-tagged deletion mutant form of pro-BMP-4 lacking the 31 amino acids comprising the linker domain as well as the S2 site (BMP-4(ΔS2L)) was constructed (illustrated above Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that the HA tag in the prodomain and the Myc tag in the mature domain have no effect on the biological activity of the encoded ligand (8Degnin C. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5012-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L) contains an optimal furin motif at the S1 site (RSKR), which, if cleaved, will produce wild-type mature BMP-4. To test whether deletion of the linker domain affects the biological activity of BMP-4, we carried out animal cap assays in Xenopus embryos. Two cell embryos were injected with RNA (600 pg) encoding pro-BMP-4 or pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L) and cultured until stage 8 (blastula), at which point the ectodermal layer (animal cap) was removed. RNA was isolated from explants when sibling embryos reached stage 10.5 and expression of the BMP-4 target gene Xbra was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. Xbra expression was detected in animal caps isolated from embryos expressing wild-type pro-BMP-4 but not pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L) (Fig. 1A). Thus, the linker domain is required to generate functional BMP-4 in vivo. To ask whether amino acid residues adjacent to the cleavage site and contained within the linker domain are required for furin to recognize its consensus motif, we assayed the ability of furin to cleave pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L) in vitro. Radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, immunoprecipitated using an antibody to the Myc tag in the mature domain and subjected to in vitro cleavage with recombinant human furin. As shown in Fig. 1B, the linker deletion mutant precursor was cleaved in vitro, in the presence of recombinant furin. To determine whether the linker domain is required for proper dimerization, folding, and/or cleavage of pro-BMP-4 in vivo, we examined maturation and processing of wild-type and linker deletion mutant forms of pro-BMP-4 in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes were injected with capped mRNA encoding pro-BMP-4 or pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L) (5 ng) along with [35S]Met/Cys. Precursor and mature ligand were immunoprecipitated from oocyte lysates using antibodies against the Myc epitope, deglycosylated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1C, upper panel). As a control, oocytes were injected with [35S]Met/Cys, in the absence of RNA and treated as above. No endogenous radiolabeled protein was pulled-down under these conditions (data not shown). Carbohydrate residues that are transferred onto proteins in the ER are sensitive to digestion with Endo H, but when further modified in the Golgi network become Endo H-resistant and sensitive to PNGase F. Thus, Endo H resistance/PNGase F sensitivity is a hallmark of proteins that are properly folded and able to traffic from the ER. As observed previously (8Degnin C. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5012-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), in lysates of oocytes made to express native BMP-4, Endo H-sensitive (Fig. 1C, dot) and PNGase F-sensitive (hatch) forms of mature BMP-4 cleaved from wild-type precursor were detected, indicating that high mannose, Endo H-sensitive carbohydrates are retained at one or more glycosylation sites(s) on mature BMP-4, even after it has trafficked through the Golgi. Thus, a subset of carbohydrates present in the mature domain of BMP-4 become inaccessible to modifying enzymes in the Golgi once the protein adopts its fully folded conformation. Endo H-sensitive (Fig. 1C, arrow) as well as Endo H-resistant/PNGase F-sensitive (arrowhead) forms of the dimerized precursor were also detected. These pro-BMP-4 dimers migrated as a tight protein band, although an additional diffuse band that migrates slightly faster and is fully Endo H-sensitive was also observed (asterisks). By contrast, in oocytes made to express pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L), the tight band was absent and only the diffuse, Endo H-sensitive band was observed (asterisks), This proprotein dimer was resistant to digestion by PNGase F, suggesting that it is misfolded, and cannot exit the ER to be cleaved. Consistent with this possibility, mature BMP-4 was not detected in lysates from oocytes made to express pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L). To further examine whether pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L) is cleaved in vivo, oocyte lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the HA tag in the prodomain and treated with or without deglycosylating agents under reducing conditions (Fig. 1C, lower panel). The predicted S2-cleaved prodomain was detected in oocytes made to express pro-BMP-4 following treatment with PNGase F, but not Endo H, indicating that this fragment was highly modified in post ER compartments. By contrast, prodomain fragments were not detected in oocyte lysates made to express the linker mutant. Together these data suggest that the linker is not required for pro-BMP-4 to dimerize, but it is required for proper folding and exit from the ER and thus for cleavage in vivo. These results were reproducible in three independent experiments. Somewhat surprisingly, although pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L) was not cleaved in Xenopus oocytes, it was efficiently cleaved in cultured mammalian cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with DNA encoding pro-BMP-4 or pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L) and precursor and cleaved mature ligand were detected by Western blot analysis using antibodies against the Myc epitope. As shown in Fig. 1D, equivalent levels of cleaved mature BMP-4 were detected in the medium of cells made to express wild type or linker deletion mutant forms of pro-BMP-4. Mature BMP-4 cleaved from wild type and linker deletion mutant precursors migrates with the same relative mobility, suggesting that both are cleaved at the same (S1) site to generate an identical ligand. To determine whether the ligand cleaved from pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L) was biologically active, we added conditioned medium from transfected HEK293 cells to C2C12 mesenchymal progenitor cells and measured levels of the osteogenic marker, alkaline phosphatase, as an indicator of BMP activity. Mature BMP-4 cleaved from the wild-type precursor induced significantly more alkaline phosphatase activity than an equivalent or greater amount of mature BMP-4 cleaved from the linker deletion mutant (Fig. 1E and data not shown). These results were confirmed in three independent experiments. The simplest explanation for these results is that the high levels of precursor protein produced in transient transfection assays can exceed the capacity for quality control in the ER, allowing misfolded pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L) dimers to escape the ER where they can be cleaved by resident PCs in the TGN to generate a partially misfolded, and thus less active ligand. By contrast, when expressed at lower levels in oocytes, misfolded pro-BMP-4(ΔS2L) dimers, are retained in the ER (Fig. 1C). These dimers are thus inaccessible to candidate convertases, which are first active in the TGN, leading to a complete loss of bioactivity. The Primary Amino Acid Sequence of the Linker Domain Is Essential for Its Function—To determine whether the primary amino acid sequence within the linker domain is important for its function we generated a cDNA encoding a precursor (pro-BMP-4(W → T)) in which a single tryptophan residue that is conserved in the linker of all known vertebrate BMP-2 and BMP-4 precursor proteins and in the Drosophila ortholog, decapentaplegic (DPP) (boxed W in Fig. 2A), was substituted with a threonine. The biological activity of mature BMP-4 cleaved from pro-BMP-4(W → T) was analyzed in a Xenopus animal cap assay as described above. The level of Xbra induced in ectodermal explants isolated from embryos injected with RNA (600 pg) encoding pro-BMP-4(W → T) was severely reduced relative to that induced in explants made to express the same amount of native precursor (Fig. 2B). This reduction in biological activity was not due to an inability of furin to recognize the cleavage motif in pro-BMP-4(W → T) because pro-BMP-4(W → T) was cleaved efficiently in vitro (Fig. 2C). Analysis of cleavage in vivo in three independent experiments, however, revealed that less mature BMP-4 was generated in Xenopus oocytes made to express pro-BMP-4(W → T) than in those expressing native precursor (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, whereas native pro-BMP-4 dimers migrated predominantly as a tight, Endo H-resistant/PNGase F-sensitive band (arrowhead), the intensity of this band was severely reduced in oocytes expressing pro-BMP-4(W → T). Pro-BMP-4(W → T) dimers instead migrated predominantly as a diffuse, fully Endo H-sensitive band (asterisk) that most likely corresponds to protein that is misfolded and cannot exit the ER to be cleaved. An additional, higher molecular weight precursor band is reproducibly detected in oocytes made to express pro-BMP-4(W → T) (dot). This same band is present at much lower levels in oocytes made to express native precursor, and most likely represents a higher molecular weight oligomer. The W-T point mutation appears to favor formation of these oligomers. Thus, the primary sequence of the linker domain is critical for its function in promoting proper folding of pro-BMP-4. Cleavage of the S1 Site of pro-BMP-4 Is Required to Generate a Bioactive Ligand—To determine whether the S2 site can be cleaved independent of the S1 site to generate a bioactive ligand that includes the linker domain, we analyzed maturation of a precursor (pro-BMP-4(S1G), illustrated above Fig. 3A) in which the furin motif at the S1 site had been disrupted. Previous studies have shown that the S2 site of this precursor is efficiently cleaved by furin in vitro (8Degnin C. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5012-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To determine whether the same is true in vivo, RNAs (5 ng) encoding HA- and Myc-tagged wild type or S1 cleavage mutant forms of pro-BMP-4 were injected into Xenopus oocytes together with [35S]Met/Cys, and precursor and cleavage products were immunoprecipitated from lysates after 20 h of culture. As shown in Fig. 3A, equivalent levels of Endo H-sensitive (arrow) and Endo H-resistant/PNGase F-sensitive (arrowheads) forms of pro-BMP-4 and pro-BMP-4(S1G) dimers were detected in oocyte lysates. Thus, blocking cleavage at the S1 site does not prevent the precursor from dimerizing or trafficking out of the ER. Furthermore, we observed two Myc-immunoreactive bands (asterisks, Fig. 3A) corresponding to mature BMP-4 in lysates of oocytes made to express BMP-4(S1G). The two bands do not result from differential N-glycosylation and are not disulfide bond conformers because they are present even following deglycosylation under reducing conditions (Fig. 3B, upper panel). The relative molecular mass (Mr) of mature BMP-4 dimers generated by cleavage at the S2 site alone is predicted to be ∼6 kDa larger than that generated by cleavage at both sites under non-reducing conditions. Based on molecular weight calculation by plotting Rf values against the log of their molecular weights (Mr) (data not shown) we predict that the minor, lower molecular weight band detected on PNGase F treatment of BMP-4(S1G) precursor (Fig. 3A) may correspond to linker-attached mature BMP-4. To determine whether the dominant, higher molecular weight Myc-reactive mature BMP-4 band might result from cryptic activation of an upstream cleavage site, which should also generate an additional prodomain species, we examined prodomain fragments generated by cleavage of pro-BMP-4(mS1G). Duplicate samples were immunoprecipitated using HA-specific antibodies and subjected to deglycosylation as above. Following deglycosylation, a single band corresponding to the S2-cleaved prodomain was observed in lysates of oocytes made to express the wild type or S1 cleavage mutant precursor (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). Thus, the additional mature BMP-4 species is not generated by cleavage of pro-BMP-4(S1G) at an upstream site within the prodomain. These data were reproduced in at least three experiments and show that mutation of the S1 site does not prevent dimerization, folding or S2 cleavage of pro-BMP-4 in vivo. Cleavage of the S2 site, however, generates an altered form(s) of mature BMP-4. To determine whether mature BMP-4 cleaved from pro-BMP-4(S1G) is biologically active, or whether it can function as a dominant mutant to block the activity of endogenous BMPs as has previously been reported for similar S1 cleavage mutant forms of pro-BMP-4 and pro-BMP-2 (10Hawley S.H.

Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we assayed its activity in whole Xenopus embryos and explants. BMPs are required for ventral patterning in vivo and thus up- or down-regulation of BMPs in whole animals causes a loss, or duplication of dorsal structures, respectively. RNA (400 pg to 1 ng) encoding pro-BMP-4 or pro-BMP-4(S1G) was injected near the dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) or ventral marginal zone (VMZ) of four-cell embryos. At the tailbud stage, embryos were scored for BMP-mediated loss of dorsal structures using the dorsoanterior index (DAI) scale (16Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 64-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) in which five signifies normal patterning (low BMP activity) and zero signifies complete loss of all dorsal and anterior structures (high BMP activity). Whereas embryos injected with RNA encoding pro-BMP-4 showed a dose-dependent ventralization, embryos injected with pro-BMP-4(S1G) showed only a minimal loss of dorsal structures at the same doses (Table 1). Conversely, embryos were assayed for the ability of pro-BMP-4(S1G) to dominantly interfere with endogenous BMP signaling in ventral cells, by scoring for induction of a secondary dorsal axis. As a positive control for BMP inhibition, 1 ng of RNA encoding a dominant mutant truncated BMP receptor (tBR) was injected near the VMZ, and this was sufficient to induce a secondary axis in 84% of embryos (Table 1). By contrast, pro-BMP-4(S1G) did not induce secondary dorsal structures even when very high doses of RNA (4 ng) were injected.TABLE 1Effect of DMZ or VMZ injection of BMP RNAs on Xenopus embryosRNADoseInjection siteDAI (range)Secondary axisn%BMP-4400 pgDMZ2.2 (0-4)068BMP-4S1G400 pgDMZ4.9"
https://openalex.org/W2121724128,"The mechanism by which activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway modulates differentiation and promotes oncogenesis in specific tissues is poorly understood. We therefore, analysed rhabdomyosarcomas from mice that were haploinsufficient for the Hh-binding protein, Hip1, or for the Hh receptor, Patched 1 (Ptch1). Transfection of the Hh-regulated transcription factor Gli1, which is expressed in a subset of mouse and human rhabdomyosarcomas, suppressed differentiation of myogenic rhabdomyosarcoma lines generated from Hip1+/− and Ptch1+/− mice. The closely related factor, Gli2, had similar effects. Gli1 and Gli2 inhibited myogenesis by repressing the capacity of MyoD to activate transcription. Deletion analysis of Gli1 indicated that multiple domains of Gli1 are required for efficient inhibition of MyoD. Gli1 reduced the ability of MyoD to heterodimerize with E12 and bind DNA, providing one mechanism whereby the Gli proteins modulate the activity of MyoD. This novel activity of Gli proteins provides new insights into how Hh signaling modulates terminal differentiation through inhibition of tissue-specific factors such as MyoD. This mechanism may contribute to the broad role of Hh signaling and the Gli proteins in differentiation decisions and cancer formation."

https://openalex.org/W1995477681,"The growth and progression of prostate cancer are dependent on androgens and androgen receptor (AR), which act by modulating gene expression. Utilizing a gene microarray approach, we have identified the α1-subunit gene of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) as a novel androgen-regulated gene. A heterodimeric cytoplasmic protein composed of one α and one β subunit, sGC mediates the widespread cellular effects of nitric oxide (NO). We report here that, in prostate cancer cells, androgens stimulate the expression of sGCα1. A cloned human sGCα1 promoter is activated by androgen in an AR-dependent manner, suggesting that sGCα1 may be a direct AR target gene. Disruption of sGCα1 expression severely compromises the growth of both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent AR-positive prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of sGCα1 alone is sufficient for stimulating prostate cancer cell proliferation. Interestingly, the major growth effect of sGCα1 is independent of NO and cyclic guanosine monophosphate, a major mediator of the sGC enzyme. These data strongly suggest that sGCα1 acts in prostate cancer via a novel pathway that does not depend on sGCβ1. Tissue studies show that sGCα1 expression is significantly elevated in advanced prostate cancer. Thus, sGCα1 may be an important mediator of the procarcinogenic effects of androgens."

Arachidonic acid may be liberated from cellular phospholipids by the action of group VIA calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2-VIA). Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that iPLA2-VIA activity is linked to the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation. Inhibition of iPLA2 activity by bromoenol lactone (BEL) was sufficient to entirely block endothelial cell growth. BEL dose-dependently inhibited endothelial cell DNA synthesis in a manner that was reversed upon the exogenous addition of arachidonic acid. DNA synthesis was inhibited by the S-isomer and not by the R-isomer of BEL, demonstrating that endothelial cell proliferation is mediated specifically by iPLA2-VIA. iPLA2-VIA activity was critical to the progression of endothelial cells through S phase and is required for the expression of the cyclin A/cdk2 complex. Thus, inhibition of iPLA2-VIA blocks S phase progression and results in exit from the cell cycle.

The endothelium lines the luminal surface of all blood vessels and is of critical importance to a variety of vascular processes, including the regulation of blood clotting and blood pressure (1Vane J.R. Anggard E.E. Botting R.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). In addition, the endothelium plays a central role in angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation from preexisting vessels (2Carmeliet P. Nat.

Kerbal R.S. Nature. 2005; 438: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar).

AA is liberated from cellular phospholipids by the action of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). The PLA2 family of enzymes hydrolyze the sn-2 fattyacyl bond of phospholipids to simultaneously generate free fatty acid and 2-lysophospholipid. Consequently, PLA2-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids containing AA at the sn-2 position liberates free AA. The PLA2 enzymes can be classified into three main groups according to their calcium requirement and enzymatic activities: the secretory PLA2s, the cytosolic PLA2s (cPLA2), and the calcium-independent PLA2s (iPLA2). The α isoform of the cPLA2 group of enzymes is thought to be a rate-limiting enzyme in AA release as it preferentially cleaves phospholipids containing AA at the sn-2 position (13Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 14Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have previously implicated cPLA2α-mediated AA release in the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation (7Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the iPLA2 family of enzymes is also involved in the regulated release of AA in a variety of cell types including endothelial cells (15Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1052-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 16Akiba S. Sato T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For example, in human umbilical artery endothelial cells and human bladder microvascular endothelial cells, thrombin-induced AA release occurs upon activation of iPLA2 (17Rickard A. Portell C. Kell P.J. Vinson S.M. McHowat J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F714-F721Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18McHowat J. Kell P.J. O'Neill H.B. Creer M.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14921-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that iPLA2-mediated AA release plays a central role in a variety of cell signaling events (15Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1052-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 16Akiba S. Sato T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The activation of iPLA2 appears to occur by different mechanisms to cPLA2α. Activation of cPLA2α is dependent on its calcium-induced translocation to membrane substrates in response to agonist stimulation and cytosolic calcium elevation (19Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Hirabayashi T. Murayama T. Shimizu T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); however, activation of iPLA2 has been reported to be independent of cytosolic calcium elevation (15Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1052-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 16Akiba S. Sato T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, it appears that calcium depletion may play a central role in the induction of iPLA2-mediated AA release (21Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Nowatzke W. Ramanadham S. Ma Z. Hsu F.F. Bohrer A. Turk J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4073-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results suggest that multiple AA mobilization mechanisms under the regulation of distinct PLA2s co-exist in cells. Furthermore, the basal PLA2 activity associated with endothelial cells is primarily attributed to iPLA2 and not cPLA2α (18McHowat J. Kell P.J. O'Neill H.B. Creer M.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14921-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Consequently, we hypothesized that iPLA2-mediated AA release may play a central role in the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The iPLA2 group of enzymes consists of two members in mammalian cells, iPLA2-VIA and iPLA2-VIB, of which iPLA2-VIA is the best characterized. Here we report that iPLA2-VIA but not iPLA2-VIB is critical to endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and S phase progression. These findings shed light on the functional role of iPLA2-VIA activity in proliferating endothelial cells. Materials—Affinity-purified goat polyclonal anti-iPLA2 (T14) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Ki67 (H300) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal anti-PCNA (610664), anti-cyclin A (611268), and anti-cdk2 (610145) antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GRASP55 antibodies were provided by S. Ponnambalam (University of Leeds, UK). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. Bromoenol lactone (BEL) was purchased from BioMol. S- and R-isomers of BEL were purchased from Cayman Chemical. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Invitrogen unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from human umbilical cords as described previously (7Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Howell G.J. Herbert S.P. Smith J.M. Mittar S. Ewan L.C. Mohammed M. Hunter A.R. Simpson N. Turner A.J. Zachary I. Walker J.H. Ponnambalam S. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) were purchased from Promocell. Cells were cultured in endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with the endothelial cell growth factor kit 2 (PromoCell) containing human recombinant epidermal growth factor (5 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (0.2 μg/ml), vascular endothelial growth factor (0.5 ng/ml), human recombinant basic-fibroblast growth factor (10 ng/ml), recombinant long R3 insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1, 20 ng/ml), ascorbic acid (1 μg/ml), heparin (22.5 μg/ml), amphotericin B (50 ng/ml), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum. All endothelial cell cultureware was coated with 0.1% (w/v) pig skin gelatin. Endothelial cells were not used in excess of three passages and expressed the characteristic endothelial markers von Willebrand factor and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humid incubator containing 5% (v/v) CO2. Cell Proliferation ELISA—HUVEC and HDMEC proliferation rates in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of BEL were compared using a 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation-based ELISA (Roche Diagnostics). For inhibitor studies, cells were seeded at 1 × 103 cells/well (0.55 × 103 cells/cm2) in 96-well plates, and cells were grown for 24 h and then processed according to manufacturer's instructions. For inhibitor studies, the BrdUrd incorporation period was fixed at 16 h. For BEL recovery studies, BrdUrd was incorporated for a period of 1 h at various time points after BEL washout. iPLA2 Activity Assay—The activity of endogenous iPLA2 was determined using a modified cPLA2 assay (Cayman Chemicals), as described previously (24Smani T. Zakharov S.I. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 25Smani T. Zakharov S.I. Leno E. Csutora P. Trepakova E.S.

SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Samples (20 μg of protein) were resolved for 60 min at 30 mA/gel on 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gels using a discontinuous buffer system (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for 3 h at 300 mA (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and then incubated overnight with primary antibody (1:500) at room temperature. For antigenic adsorption, antibodies were preincubated with blocking peptide (1:5 ratio of μg of antibody to μg of peptide) for at least 3 h prior to incubation with membranes overnight. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:3000) for 1 h, immunoreactive bands were visualized using a West Pico enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Pierce). A Fujifilm Intelligent Dark Box II image reader using Fuji Las-1000 Pro software was used to capture images. Band intensities were determined densitometrically using Aida (Advanced Image Data Analyzer) 2.11 software. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total mRNA was isolated from proliferating HUVECs using TRIzol reagent. 2 μg of total mRNA was then reverse-transcribed using Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase and then subjected to 36 cycles of PCR (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) with iPLA2-VIA specific primers, as described previously (28Larsson P.K. Claesson H.E. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 207: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Primers used for PCR were: sense, 5′-AACGTTAACCTCAGGCCTCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GAGAGTTTCTTCACCTTGTT-3′. PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels. Flow Cytometry—Subconfluent HUVECs were cultured for 16 h in the presence or absence of 5 μm BEL. Cells were then harvested, fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and incubated with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and RNase A (20 μg/ml) for 3 h. Propidium iodide-stained DNA content was then assessed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was analyzed using ModFit software (Verity Software House). RNA Interference—HUVECs were transfected with no siRNA (control), 50 nm non-targeting control siRNA (mock-transfected; D-001210-01; Dharmacon), or 50 nm annealed iPLA2-VIA siRNA (siRNA; 139141; Ambion) for 4 h using the Lipofectamine2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Angiogenesis Assay—Co-cultures of HUVECs seeded on a bed of human fibroblasts (TCS Cellworks) were cultured for 7 days in the presence or absence of 5 μm BEL. Tubules were then fixed and stained for PECAM-1. Stained tubules were then imaged by phase contrast microscopy, and tubule length was quantified using NIH Image J software. BEL Inhibits Endothelial Cell Growth—BEL is a catalytic site-directed inhibitor of iPLA2 activity (29Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 30Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effects of BEL treatment on endothelial cell growth, HUVECs were seeded at a density of 3 × 103 cells/cm2 and were allowed to settle for 24 h. HUVECs were then maintained in normal growth medium for a period of 7 days in the presence or absence of 5 μm BEL (Fig. 1A). At 24-h intervals, cells were harvested for determination of cell numbers. As expected, when grown in the absence of BEL, cell numbers increased as a function of time. After 7 days in culture, cell numbers had increased 18.5-fold to reach 55.4 ± 4.5 × 103 cells/cm2. However, when HUVECs were cultured in the presence of BEL, growth was entirely blocked. Upon incubation with BEL, no significant increase in cell density was observed at any time point relative to the previous time point. Thus, in the presence of BEL, HUVEC density remained constant throughout the growth period. Phenotypic differences have been identified between endothelial cells derived from large vessels, such as HUVECs, and endothelial cells derived from the microvasculature (6Staton C.A. Stribbling S.M. Tazzyman S. Hughes R. Brown N.J. Lewis C.F. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 31Jackson C.J. Nguyen M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); however, similar results were seen upon the incubation of HDMECs with 5 μm BEL (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of HUVEC and HDMEC growth was not a consequence of enhanced cell death as incubation with 5 μm BEL for 7 days had no effect on cell viability, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). Furthermore, incubation with 5 μm BEL had no effect on HUVEC or HDMEC morphology (Fig. 1C). Therefore, BEL-mediated reduction of growth was not due to cellular toxicity. HUVECs grown for 5 days in the presence of 5 μm BEL recovered from 4.6 ± 0.6 × 103 to 96 ± 3.6 × 103 cells/cm2 upon inhibitor washout after recovery for 8 days (Fig. 1D). Thus, the inhibitory effect of BEL on endothelial cell growth was also fully reversible. iPLA2 Activity Mediates Endothelial Cell DNA Synthesis— The effects of BEL on HUVEC DNA synthesis was assessed by determining BrdUrd incorporation into cellular DNA in the presence of varying concentrations of BEL (Fig. 2A). HUVECs, seeded at a density of 0.55 × 103 cells/cm2, were cultured for 24 h and then allowed to incorporate BrdUrd for 16 h in the presence or absence of inhibitor. BEL acted in a dose-dependent manner, inhibiting HUVEC proliferation by 18.9 ± 6, 73.1 ± 2.3, and 91.5 ± 0.7% at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 μm, respectively. Similarly, upon incubation with 1, 5 and 10 μm BEL, HDMEC proliferation was inhibited by 25.3 ± 3.7, 53.5 ± 3.7, and 93.4 ± 1.2% (Fig. 2B). Although BEL selectively targets iPLA2 over other PLA2s (29Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 30Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may also inhibit other cellular enzymes. Despite this, the exogenous addition of 100 nm AA significantly attenuated the antiproliferative effect of 5 μm BEL (Fig. 2C), suggesting that iPLA2-mediated AA release is involved in the control of endothelial cell DNA synthesis. However, the exogenous addition of other downstream products of iPLA2 activity (lysophosphatidyl choline and diacylglycerol) was not able to recover the inhibitory effects of BEL. Recovery of iPLA2 Activity Is Correlated with the Induction of HUVEC Proliferation—HUVECs seeded at a density of 0.55 × 103 cells/cm2 were cultured in the presence of 5 μm BEL for 5 days prior to inhibitor washout and recovery. HUVEC DNA synthesis was then assessed at varying time points after inhibitor washout by determining BrdUrd incorporation into cellular DNA (Fig. 3A). No significant increase in HUVEC DNA synthesis was observed up to 8 h after inhibitor washout. However, after 16 h of recovery, HUVEC BrdUrd incorporation was elevated 5.9-fold relative to 0 h after recovery. To establish whether the recovery of iPLA2 activity is involved in the recovery of HUVEC proliferation, iPLA2 activity was assessed at varying times after BEL washout (Fig. 3B). Similarly, no significant increase in iPLA2 activity was observed up to 8 h after inhibitor washout. Furthermore, in correlation with BrdUrd incorporation, there was a significant increase in iPLA2 activity after 16 h of recovery. These findings suggested that iPLA2 activity is indeed vital to the proliferation of endothelial cells. iPLA2-VIA but Not iPLA2-VIB Mediates Endothelial Cell DNA Synthesis—Due to its ability to inhibit both iPLA2-VIA and iPLA2-VIB, it is difficult to distinguish the effects of BEL on each family member. However, separation of BEL into its two enantiomers reveals that the S-isoform of BEL is significantly more potent toward iPLA2-VIA than iPLA2-VIB (32Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, the R-isoform is considerably more effective at inhibiting iPLA2-VIB than iPLA2-VIA (32Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, the enantiomers of BEL can be used to attribute the effects of BEL to either iPLA2-VIA or iPLA2-VIB. The effects of 10 μm S-BEL and 10 μm R-BEL on HUVEC proliferation were assessed by determining BrdUrd incorporation over 16 h (Fig. 4A). In the presence of S-BEL, HUVEC proliferation was inhibited by 72.9 ± 3.3%, whereas R-BEL had no significant effect on cellular proliferation. Consequently, the antiproliferative effects of BEL are due to its inhibition of iPLA2-VIA and not iPLA2-VIB. The expression of iPLA2-VIA in endothelial cells was confirmed upon detection of iPLA2-VIA protein and mRNA in HUVECs by Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). Western blotting using a well characterized affinity-purified antibody directed toward the C-terminal region of iPLA2-VIA (33Manguikian A.D. Barbour S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52881-52892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) detected an immunoreactive band of 80 kDa corresponding to iPLA2-VIA. In addition, iPLA2-VIA immunoreactivity could be eliminated upon preabsorption of antibody with antigenic peptide (Fig. 4B, T-14). Furthermore, as predicted, a 218-bp RT-PCR product was obtained from HUVEC mRNA using primers specific to sequences in the C terminus of iPLA2-VIA (Fig. 4C). PCR of total mRNA without a prior RT step did not produce any product, excluding the possibility of the amplification of genomic DNA (data not shown). The identity of this RT-PCR product was confirmed upon restriction endonuclease digestion (HhaI) to produce fragments of 101 and 117 kb as expected (Fig. 4B). Thus, we decided to further investigate the role of iPLA2-VIA in the control of the endothelial cell cycle. iPLA2-VIA Mediates Cell Cycle Residence—The role of iPLA2-VIA in cell cycle progression was assessed by investigating the cell cycle distribution of HUVECs by flow cytometry. HUVECs were cultured for 16 h in the presence or absence of 5 μm BEL and then stained with propidium iodide prior to flow cytometry. In the presence of BEL, the number of cells residing in the S phase of the cell cycle was reduced by 71.3% (Fig. 5A). As a consequence, significantly more cells resided in the G0–G1 phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that iPLA2-VIA plays a key role in G1 to S phase progression. This was further reinforced upon analysis of Ki67 expression levels in response to iPLA2-VIA inhibition. Ki67 is a nuclear protein expressed in the G1, S, G2, and mitotic phases of the cell cycle but not in the G0 phase of quiescence (34Gerdes J. Lemke H. Baisch H. Wacker H.H. Schwab U. Stein H. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1710-1715PubMed Google Scholar, 35Schluter C. Duchrow M. Wohlenberg C. Becker M.H. Key G. Flad H.D. Gerdes J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Incubation with BEL significantly reduced Ki67 expression in HUVECs (Fig. 5B), indicating that fewer cells resided in the cell cycle. Thus, iPLA2-VIA activity mediates endothelial cell cycle residence. iPLA2-VIA Mediates S Phase Progression—Transition from G1 to S phase is dependent on the assembly and activation of the DNA replication complex and initiation of DNA synthesis. The replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a vital component of the replication complex. PCNA expression is low throughout the cell cycle until early S phase and initiation of replication clamp formation (36Takahashi T. Caviness V.S. J. Neurocytol. 1993; 22: 1096-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 37Paunesku T. Mittal S. Protic M. Oryhon J. Korolev S.V. Joachimiak A. Woloschak G.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2001; 77: 1007-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Consequently, S phase entry and replication clamp formation can be monitored by assessing the cellular levels of PCNA. Upon incubation for 16 h with 5 μm BEL, the cellular levels of PCNA were unaffected (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that in the presence of BEL, endothelial cells still enter S phase; however, cells are unable to progress through S phase as DNA synthesis is inhibited upon iPLA2-VIA inhibition. The activation of preassembled replication complexes and initiation of DNA synthesis is mediated by the cyclin A/cdk2 complex in early S phase. Mammalian cells cannot synthesize DNA or progress through S phase in the absence of cyclin A/cdk2 activity (38Coverley D. Laman H. Laskey R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 39Girard F. Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Inhibition of iPLA2-VIA significantly reduced the expression of endothelial cell cyclin A/cdk2 as assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 6A). Analysis of immunoreactive band intensities revealed that incubation with 5 μm BEL reduced cyclin A and cdk2 expression levels to 34.3 ± 7.2 and 46 ± 4.8% of controls, respectively (Fig. 6B). Reduced cyclin A/cdk2 expression but unaffected PCNA expression are consistent with a block in early S phase and account for the block in G1-S phase progression and inhibition of DNA synthesis seen previously. Thus, iPLA2-VIA activity may play a critical role in endothelial cell cycle regulation by mediating S phase progression and the initiation of DNA synthesis. Inhibition of iPLA2-VIA Prior to S Phase Entry Blocks HUVEC Cell Cycle Progression—The previous data suggested that iPLA2-VIA mediates endothelial cell S phase progression and the expression of cyclin A/cdk2. However, these effects may be an indirect effect due to a lack of progression from G0. Thus, the effects of iPLA2-VIA inhibition were assessed at different points in the endothelial cell cycle (Fig. 7). HUVECs were grown to confluence to synchronize cells in G0 (40Okada T. Lopez-Lago M. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). HUVECs were then harvested and seeded at a lower density (1 in 4) to induce proliferation. At varying time points after seeding, HUVECs were lysed, and the levels of cyclin A expression were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 7A). As expected, the levels of cyclin A expression were initially low as cells entered the cell cycle and progressed through G1. However, after 15 h of growth, cells enter S phase and begin to express cyclin A, reaching a maximum of cyclin A expression at 21–24 h after seeding (Fig. 7A). To assess the effects of BEL on the induction of cyclin A expression in S phase, G0 synchronized HUVECs were again seeded at a low density (1 in 4) and allowed to proliferate. Cells were then lysed after 24 h of growth either in the absence of BEL (control) or after the addition of 5 μm BEL at varying periods after seeding (6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 h; Fig. 7B). The levels of cyclin A expression in these lysates was then analyzed by Western blotting. The addition of BEL up to 12 h after seeding (before S phase entry) almost completely blocked the induction of cyclin A expression relative to control cells. However, the addition of BEL to cells after 15, 18, and 21 h of growth (after S phase entry) had no effect on the induction of cyclin A expression. Thus, iPLA2-VIA activity in early S phase is critical to endothelial cell S phase progression. siRNA-mediated Knockdown of Endogenous iPLA2-VIA— The previous data are consistent with a vital role for iPLA2-VIA in the regulation of endothelial cell cycle progression. Despite this, the use of BEL to inhibit iPLA2-VIA activity is also known to inhibit a number of other enzyme activities (41Bao S. Bohrer A. Ramanadham S. Jin W. Zhang S. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of BEL on cell proliferation could possibly be due to inhibition of these and not inhibition of iPLA2-VIA. To exclude this possibility, iPLA2-VIA-targeted siRNA was used to corroborate the previous pharmacological studies. Consistent with the inhibitor studies, knockdown of endogenous iPLA2-VIA significantly reduced the levels of cyclin A and cdk2 expression to 3 and 22% of non-targeting siRNA controls (mock), respectively (Fig. 8, A and B). Consequently, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous iPLA2-VIA was sufficient to almost completely inhibit HUVEC proliferation (98% inhibition relative to mock; Fig. 8C). Thus, iPLA2-VIA plays a vital role in the control of endothelial cell S phase progression and proliferation. iPLA2-VIA Activity Is Critical to Angiogenesis—Upon the induction of angiogenesis, endothelial cells proliferate, migrate, and differentiate to form new blood vessels. Consequently, the induction of endothelial cell proliferation is central to the angiogenic response. As iPLA2-VIA mediates endothelial cell proliferation, we hypothesized that its activity may be essential to the angiogenic process. Endothelial cell angiogenesis can be assessed using co-culture assays. In these assays, HUVECs are seeded on a bed of human dermal fibroblasts and cultured for 7 days. Under these conditions, endothelial cells form tubules with patent lumens, reminiscent of mature capillaries (6Staton C.A. Stribbling S.M. Tazzyman S. Hughes R. Brown N.J. Lewis C.F. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Incubation with BEL reduced tubule length to 59.1 ± 2.9 and 30 ± 3.3% of controls at 5 and 10μm, respectively (Fig. 9, A and B). Thus, iPLA2-VIA-mediated endothelial cell proliferation plays a central role in the formation of new blood capillaries by angiogenesis in vitro assays. In this study, we define a novel role for iPLA2-VIA in the regulation of endothelial cell S phase progression and angiogenesis. iPLA2-VIA has previously been implicated in the regulation of the proliferation of a variety of cell types (33Manguikian A.D. Barbour S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52881-52892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Bao S. Bohrer A. Ramanadham S. Jin W. Zhang S. Turk J. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite this, the mechanism of the regulation of cellular proliferation by iPLA2-VIA remains undefined. Studies with Jurkat T-cells and CHO-K1 cells suggest that in these cell types, iPLA2-VIA activity plays a role in progression from G2 to M phase (33Manguikian A.D. Barbour S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52881-52892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43Roshak A.K. Capper E.A. Stevenson C. Eichman C. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35692-35698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In these studies, iPLA2-VIA activity is maximal at the G2/M phase border and is required for cell division (43Roshak A.K. Capper E.A. Stevenson C. Eichman C. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35692-35698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); however, these effects were not mediated by AA. These studies suggested that iPLA2-VIA activity plays a central role in cell growth and division by regulating glycerophospholipid metabolism throughout the cell cycle. Contrary to this model, a recent study documents that stable suppression of iPLA2-VIA in INS-1 β-cells has no effect on cellular lipid content or composition but still results in inhibition of cellular proliferation (41Bao S. Bohrer A. Ramanadham S. Jin W. Zhang S. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of iPLA2-VIA in INS-1 β-cell results in elevated proliferation (44Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Wohltmann M. Bohrer A. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Lipids. 2001; 36: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for iPLA2-VIA in the mitogenic signaling of INS-1 β-cells but not in phospholipid remodeling. Similarly, a role for iPLA2-VIA in the mitogenic signaling of thrombin-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells was recently proposed (42Yellaturu C.R. Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43831-43837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results complement these latest findings by documenting that endothelial cell proliferation and S phase progression are dependent on iPLA2-VIA-mediated AA release. Thus, it is an emerging concept that iPLA2-VIA plays a central role in the mitogenic signaling of a variety of cell types. Although previous studies have suggested an involvement of iPLA2-VIA in proliferation, our study is the first to define the role of iPLA2-VIA in the regulation of cellular proliferation. Here we show that iPLA2-VIA mediates the progression of endothelial cells through S phase. Thus, inhibition of iPLA2-VIA blocks the initiation of DNA synthesis and results in exit from the cell cycle. This is consistent with observations in Jurkat T-cells showing that iPLA2-VIA activity is a requirement for exit from the G0 phase of quiescence (43Roshak A.K. Capper E.A. Stevenson C. Eichman C. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35692-35698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in studies that have analyzed the activity of iPLA2-VIA activity throughout the cell cycle, it appears that its activity increases at the beginning of S phase to reach a peak at G2/M (33Manguikian A.D. Barbour S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52881-52892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43Roshak A.K. Capper E.A. Stevenson C. Eichman C. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35692-35698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An up-regulation of iPLA2-VIA activity in early S phase may be responsible for promoting S phase progression and the subsequent induction of cyclin A/cdk2 activity required for the initiation of DNA synthesis. An early event in the induction of angiogenesis is the entry of quiescent endothelial cells back into the cell cycle. Consequently, the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation and cell cycle progression is a key component of the angiogenic response (2Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3468) Google Scholar). We find that inhibition of iPLA2-VIA-mediated endothelial cell proliferation is sufficient to block angiogenic tubule formation in co-culture assays. Thus, inhibition of endothelial cell iPLA2-VIA activity may represent a viable antiangiogenic route for the treatment of cancer. The potential of iPLA2-VIA as a therapeutic target without adverse side effects is reinforced by the fact that the only reported phenotypic defect in iPLA2-VIA knock-out mice is the production of spermatozoa with impaired motility (48Bao S. Miller J.R. Ma Z. Woltmann M. Eng G. Ramanadham S. Molley K. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38194-38200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have previously implicated cPLA2α-mediated AA release in the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation (7Herbert S.P. Ponnambalam S. Walker J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consequently, it appears that there are at least two distinct AA mobilization mechanisms, which are under the regulation of iPLA2-VIA and cPLA2α, in endothelial cells. Furthermore, inhibition of cPLA2α blocks S phase progression and results in the down-regulation of cyclin A/cdk2 expression, 3S. P. Herbert and J. H. Walker, manuscript in preparation. suggesting that cPLA2α and iPLA2-VIA play cooperative roles in regulating endothelial cell proliferation. Similarly, a potential cooperative role for both cPLA2α and iPLA2-VIA was previously suggested for the control of A549 cell proliferation (47Choudhury Q.G. McKay D.T. Flower R.J. Croxtall J.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that basal iPLA2-VIA activity or stimulated cPLA2α activity alone are insufficient to promote S phase progression and that DNA synthesis can only proceed upon the combined activation of iPLA2-VIA and cPLA2α. Alternatively, it may be that both iPLA2-VIA and cPLA2α meditate S phase progression by differing downstream mechanisms. To fully understand the roles of iPLA2-VIA and cPLA2α in cellular proliferation, the next challenges will include elucidation of the specific downstream metabolites of AA involved in both iPLA2-VIA-mediated and cPLA2α-mediated cell proliferation. We thank S. Ponnambalam and G. J. Howell for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2000284333,"Protein p21Cip1/Waf1 is transcriptionally activated by the tumour suppressor p53 and previous studies have shown that p21 plays a role in tumour suppression. However, the involvement of p21 in p53-mediated tumour suppression remains to be directly demonstrated in vivo. Tumour suppression mediated by p53 can be measured by comparing tumour susceptibility in animals carrying two (wild-type mice) or three (super-p53 mice) copies of the p53 gene. We have taken advantage of this genetically defined system to measure p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and tumorigenesis, in a p21 wild-type and in a p21-null context. The absence of p21 significantly impaired the enhanced p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest characteristic of super-p53 cells, but did not affect the enhanced apoptosis. Importantly, in an experimental model of fibrosarcoma induction, the absence of p21 significantly decreased the tumour suppression benefit of super-p53 mice. We conclude that cell-cycle arrest through p21 plays a significant role in mediating p53-dependent cancer protection."

Mice with genetic disruptions of the Ikkβ or Ikkγ gene loci die during embryogenesis because of severe hepatic apoptosis. We now show that Ikkβ gene deficiency promotes migration and proliferation of mouse embryo fibroblast cells. Morphological analyses revealed an unusual protrusion of the cytoplasm in Ikkβ-/- cells when cultured at a lower density. In a Boyden chamber assay, Ikkβ-/- cells exhibited a high rate of invasion and migration. Enhanced formation of actin stress fibers was also observed in the Ikkβ-/- cells.

Although the underlying mechanism is likely entangled and complicated, the data presented indicate that generation of ROS played a key role in the morphological and mobility changes in Ikkβ-/- cells.

Yamamoto Y. Wang Q.M. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2004; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). In addition to these key components, recent studies have indicated association of IKK with cdc37, hsp90 (2Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and ELKS, a coiled-coil protein (3Ducut Sigala J.L. Bottero V. Young D.B. Shevchenko A. Mercurio F. Verma I.M. Science. 2004; 304: 1963-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In response to inflammatory signals, the IKK is activated through a Lys63 polyubiquitination of IKKγ/NEMO subunit (4Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), whereas DNA damaging signals induce monoubquitination of IKKγ/NEMO in an ataxia telangiectasia mutation-dependent manner (5Wu Z.H. Shi Y. Gibbetts R.S. Miyamoto S. Science. 2006; 311: 1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The activated IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation and subsequent activation of NF-κB (4Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). In addition, the IKK complex is able to modulate the transcriptional activity of the activated NF-κB in the nucleus by directly phosphorylating NF-κB dimers or recruiting co-factors to the gene promoter region (1Karin M. Yamamoto Y. Wang Q.M. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2004; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). This may also enhance the promoter clearance of certain NF-κB complexes (6Lawrence T. Bebien M. Liu G.Y. Nizet V. Karin M. Nature. 2005; 434: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Mice with genetic disruptions in genes encoding key subunits of IKK or NF-κB die during embryogenesis or postnatally because of severe liver failure or other aberrations (7Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y.

Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Cells derived from NF-κB-deficient mice are prone to be apoptotic in response to a variety of stress signals (9Chen F.

Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of NF-κB has been generally viewed as a major promoter of cell survival or proliferation by inducing either anti-apoptotic proteins including cIAPs, BclX, XIAP, and Bcl2, or proliferative molecules, such as cyclin D1, CoxII, and interleukin 6 (12Sun S.C. Yamaoka S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5952-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Sustained activation of NF-κB can result in insensitivity to growth inhibition, evasion of apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis that contributes to tumor progression (13Viatour P. Merville M.P.

It is not surprising, therefore, that a plethora of endogenous and exogenous molecules that inhibit the activation of NF-κB are being considered as potential chemotherapeutical or chemoprevention agents (14Verma I.M. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2004; 63: 57-61Google Scholar, 16Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Thus far, the majority of evidence indicating an anti-apoptotic or carcinogenic role of IKK or its downstream effecter, NF-κB, is from gain- or loss-of-function of molecules important in the activation or activity of NF-κB in human cancer cell lines. In addition to these well characterized growth regulatory roles, it is still debatable whether the IKK-NF-κB pathway can affect other cellular functions in cells that are under a relatively native state. In the present study, we describe a previously undefined role for IKKβ in the regulation of cell morphology and mobilization. We show that loss of the Ikkβ gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in a spindled morphologic change with an enhanced formation of actin stress fibers. The alteration in cell morphology and reorganization of stress fibers may further promote cell migration and invasion. Cell Morphologic Analysis and Immunoblotting—The mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from wt and Ikkβ-/- mice within 5-10 passages were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen) as described (9Chen F. Castranova V. Li Z. Karin M. Shi X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7689-7693PubMed Google Scholar). For cell morphologic analysis, the cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates for the indicated time and stained with 0.4% of crystal violet in 10% ethanol for 10 min. The total cell lysates were used to determine the expression of proteins involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton and mobility using the indicated antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunofluorescence—The cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 6-well tissue culture plates and maintained at 37 °C for 24 h. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with FITC-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in a humidified chamber. The actin structure was analyzed using a Zeiss microscope (Axio-vert100) equipped with a Pixera Pro150ES digital camera. Cell Invasion and Migration—In vitro invasion and migration were determined by a modified Boyden chamber assay using cell culture inserts with a polycarbonate filter coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in a 24-well format. Briefly, 20,000 cells in 250 μl of serum-free DMEM were added to the inserts. The lower chambers were filled with 1% FCS in DMEM. The chambers were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. The cells that did not migrate through the filter were removed from the insides of the inserts by cotton swab. The cells migrated to the underside of the coated membrane were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then stained with crystal violet. The membranes were cut from the inserts and examined under a microscope. RNA Interference and Overexpression—To knock down the endogenous Ikkβ mRNA in wt cells, siRNA that targets nucleotides 1559-1577 of the mouse Ikkβ mRNA (GenBank™ accession number: AF088910) was synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified. The wt cells were seeded in six-well plates on the day before transfection at a concentration of 5 × 105/ml cells. The transfection of siRNA was performed by using RNAiFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions at a final siRNA duplex concentration of 100 nm. Overexpression of Ikkβ in the Ikkβ-/- cells was performed by transfecting the cells with an expression vector containing a full-length Ikkβ cDNA as previously described (17Chen F. Bower J. Leonard S.S. Ding M. Lu Y. Rojanasakul Y. Kung H.F. Vallyathan V. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3342-3349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ikkβ-/- Cells Show Morphological Changes—Much attention has been focused on the effects of IKK or its downstream target, NF-κB, on cell growth or survival. However, by using mouse embryo fibroblast cells derived from wt and Ikkβ gene knock-out (Ikkβ-/-) mice, we have unexpectedly noted an effect of IKKβ in cell migration and proliferation. WT and Ikkβ-/- cells show similar morphology when cultured at the regular density (Fig. 1A, left panels). Surprisingly, a profound change in cell morphology was observed when Ikkβ-/- cells were cultured at a lower density. As shown in Fig. 1A, Ikkβ-/- cells exhibited an unusual extended phenotype that was distinct from that of wt cells cultured at the same density (Fig. 1A, right panels). In addition, the majority of Ikkβ-/- cells displayed exaggerated lamellipodia that are often concurrently observed at the leading edge of cells, some of which form multiple microruffles. In wt cells, the ratio between the long and short axes of the cells was approximately 2:1. This ratio was increased to 4-10:1 in Ikkβ-/- cells because of the extended protrusion of the cytoplasm. The morphological difference between wt and Ikkβ-/- cells might be a result of alteration in cell spreading. To test this, we seeded the cells sparsely and stained the cells at the selected time points. The cytoplasm of wt cells spread evenly around the cell center on the surface of the culture plate at 20, 40, 80, or 240 s (Fig. 1B, upper panels). These cells form the shape of a “fried egg” at 20, 40, or 80 s of plating. In comparison with wt cells, the spreading of Ikkβ-/- cells was notably delayed at 20, 40, or 80 s. After 240 s, however, the majority of Ikkβ-/- cells exhibited an ameboid shape with aberrant large protrusions that were unevenly distributed (Fig. 1B, bottom panels). Despite the extended protrusion of the cell membrane, analysis of cell adhesion capacity by a trypsin detachment revealed faster detachment of Ikkβ-/- cells. Both wt and Ikkβ-/- cells were seeded in culture plates and kept to confluence. The adhesive capacity of Ikkβ-/- cells was compared with that of wt cells by incubation of these cells with 0.01% of trypsin. As shown in Fig. 1C, Ikkβ-/- cells display less adhesion than wt cells. Complete detachment of Ikkβ-/- cells was observed after 3 min of trypsin treatment. In contrast, wt cells appeared to be resistant to trypsin detachment. More than 80 and 50% of wt cells remained attached after 3 and 8 min of trypsin treatment, respectively. Therefore, these data suggested that Ikkβ deficiency weakens the adhesive ability of the cells, which might correlate with an enhanced mobility of these cells (see below). Enhanced Invasion and Migration in Ikkβ-/- Cells—The unusual change in the morphology of Ikkβ-/- cells indicates possible alterations in actin cytoskeleton organization, which provides the protrusive force required for the outgrowth of lamellipodia or microruffles. Therefore, we examined the status of actin stress fibers by staining both wt and Ikkβ-/- cells with FITC-phalloidin and assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Stress fibers are much less apparent in wt cells (Fig. 2A, upper panels). In contrast, a substantial enhancement of actin stress fiber formation could be observed in Ikkβ-/- cells (Fig. 2A, lower panels). To evaluate formation of actin stress fibers at the level of individual cells, the sparsely seeded cells were stained with FITC-phalloidin and monitored microscopically. Actin stress fibers that were roughly parallel to the long axe of the cell were visible inside Ikkβ-/- cells, whereas this characteristic was barely seen in wt cells (Fig. 2A, right panels). The alterations in cell membrane protrusion, adhesion, and the formation of actin stress fibers in Ikkβ-/- cells are indicative of an invasive phenotype. Invasive cells are able to penetrate a reconstituted extracellular matrix barrier. In a modified Boyden chamber assay in which the inserted filter membrane was coated with Matrigel, 1% of serum in the lower chamber efficiently promoted migration and invasion of Ikkβ-/- cells (Fig. 2B). Quantification of cell invasion revealed that more than 30% of Ikkβ-/- cells penetrated through the Matrigel and transferred to the underside of the coated filter (data not shown). Interestingly, ∼10% of these cells even mobilized through the gap between the filter and the surface of the bottom chamber (Fig. 2B, Migrated). No appreciable invasion and migration was observed with wt cells, indicating that these cells do not respond to the chemotactic force of the serum (Fig. 2B, Migrated). To determine the molecular mechanisms of how the loss of IKKβ affects cell morphology, invasion, and migration, we next investigated the levels of several kinases or proteins that affect the motility and reorganization of cytoskeleton by either fluorescence-based immunostaining or immunoblotting. As can be seen in Fig. 2 (C and D), although wt and Ikkβ-/- cells expressed a comparable level of total focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and its phosphorylated form (pFAK), a notable increase of pFAK staining was observed in peripheral focal adhesion sites of Ikkβ-/- cells (Fig. 2C, indicated by white arrows). The levels of cytokeratin 8 (Fig. 2C) and vinculin (Fig. 2D) were equivalent between wt and Ikkβ-/- cells. However, a decreased expression of talin (Fig. 2, C and D) and a marginal increase in expression of Pyk2 and ILK were observed in Ikkβ-/- cells. It has been known that pFAK, Pyk2, and ILK are kinases linked to the cytoskeletal contractile machinery that provides the cells with mobility force. In addition, a globe gene profiling indicated an increased expression of several genes involved in assembly of actin filaments in Ikkβ-/- cells (Table 1). These genes include cardiac ankyrin repeat protein, protheymosin β4, and tropomyosin 2, which can regulate the remodeling of actin cytoskeleton during cell migration (18Otey C.A. Rachlin A. Moza M. Arneman D. Carpen O. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 246: 31-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and versican, an anti-cell adhesion molecule (19Yoon H. Liyanarachchi S. Wright F.A. Davuluri R. de la Lockman J.C. Chapelle A. Pellegata N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15632-15637Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, a more than 100-fold decrease in the expression of IGFBP2, a previously identified NF-κB-regulated gene involved in the inhibition of mitogenesis (20Cazals V. Nabeyrat E. Corroyer S. de Keyzer Y. Clement A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Eichten A. Rud D.S. Grace M. Piboonniyom S.O. Zacny V. Munger K. Virology. 2004; 319: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was observed in Ikkβ-/- cells. Furthermore, Ikkβ-/- cells exhibited a decreased expression of genes associated with inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP-2 and TIMP-3) and cell adhesion (VCAM and integrin β5) (Table 1). Thus, alterations in expression or activity of these kinases and proteins might explain the higher motility of Ikkβ-/- cells.TABLE 1-Fold changes in genes encoding proteins involved in cell growth and motility in Ikkβ−/− cells compared with wt cellsGeneIkkβ−/− vs. wtGenBank™ accession numberFunctionCARP156.3AF041847Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein, binding to myopalladinVersican9.7D45889Anti-cell adhesive moleculesα-Actin2.6X13297Cytoskeleton, stress fibersProtheymosin β42.34U38967Prevents actin polymerizationS100A42.2M36579Tumor metastasis, calcium-binding proteinTropomyosin22.0M22479Actin-binding proteinIGFBP2−134X81580Inhibitor of cell mitogenesisTIMP-2−5.8X62622Inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinasesTIMP-3−4.0U26437Inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinasesVCAM−2.9M84487Cell adhesionIntegrin β5−2.0AF022110Cell adhesion Open table in a new tab Ikkβ-/- Cells Exhibited a Faster Growth Rate than That of wt Cells—It is believed that deficiency in NF-κB signaling will generally diminish the anti-apoptotic potency of the cells caused by the reduced expression of several pro-survival and anti-apoptotic genes. These genes include bcl-x, c-FLIP, cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, Bfl-1, and IEX-1. The product of these pro-survival or anti-apoptotic genes may either directly block caspase activation or provide unique protection of mitochondrial membrane. Indeed, we and others have previously demonstrated that Ikkβ deficiency sensitizes mouse embryo fibroblast cells to apoptotic or necrotic death in response to stress signals (9Chen F. Castranova V. Li Z. Karin M. Shi X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7689-7693PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A.

Unexpectedly, the Ikkβ-/- cells exhibited an ∼3-4-fold increase in cell proliferation compared with wt cells when cultured in the normal medium containing 10% FCS (Fig. 3). IKKβ Inhibition Alters Morphology and Mobility of Human Epithelial Cells—It is unclear whether the increased cell motility and proliferation in Ikkβ-/- cells is a result of IKK-NF-κB deficiency or an artifact of the cellular responses during immortalization of embryonic cells. To address this issue, we stably transfected a human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) with control vector, wild type Ikkβ, or kinase-mutated Ikkβ (Ikkβ-KM). The BEAS-2B cell line is derived from human bronchial epithelial through transformation with an adenovirus-12-SV40 hybrid virus (23Reddel R.R. Ke Y. Gerwin B.I. McMenamin M.G. Lechner J.F. Su R.T. Brash D.E. Park J.B. Rhim J.S. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1904-1909PubMed Google Scholar). These cells retain morphologic features of epithelial cells without tight junction under normal culture conditions (23Reddel R.R. Ke Y. Gerwin B.I. McMenamin M.G. Lechner J.F. Su R.T. Brash D.E. Park J.B. Rhim J.S. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1904-1909PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated substantial inhibition of the endogenous IKKβ kinase and NF-κB activities in the cells stably expressing Ikkβ-KM (17Chen F. Bower J. Leonard S.S. Ding M. Lu Y. Rojanasakul Y. Kung H.F. Vallyathan V. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3342-3349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Chen F. Lu Y. Zhang Z. Vallyathan V. Ding M. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11414-11419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Transfection of the cells with wild type human Ikkβ cDNA neither changed their morphology nor increased cell invasion/proliferation in a soft agar-based colony formation assay (Fig. 4A). However, the cells transfected with a kinase-mutated Ikkβ, Ikkβ-KM, exhibited a much prolonged spindled morphology, a characteristic feature of the cells during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumorigenesis (24Lee J.M. Dedhar S. Kalluri R. Thompson E.W. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). In addition, the growth of the cells expressing Ikkβ-KM is distinct from the cells transfected with a control vector or wild type Ikkβ vector. The Ikkβ-KM-expressing cells showed an enhanced invasiveness and proliferation as indicated by the formation of giant colonies in soft agar (Fig. 4A, bottom panels). Because the BEAS-2B cell line was established by a virus-mediated transformation, these cells showed basal activity of migration in a Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 4B). As seen in Ikkβ-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the BEAS-2B cells stably expressing Ikkβ-KM exhibited an enhanced motility in a migration assay, whereas expression of the wild type Ikkβ neither enhances nor reduces such activity in both Boyden chamber and wound healing assays (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, these data provide complementary evidence indicating that Ikkβ deficiency does affect the cell morphology, enhance cell growth, and promote cell migration. In addition, the results also suggest that the observed effects may not be restricted to mouse embryo fibroblast cells. Re-expression of Ikkβ Reversed Morphological Changes in Ikkβ-/- Cells—The influence of Ikkβ on the cell morphology was further determined by siRNA-based silencing of the endogenous Ikkβ mRNA in wt cells or transfection of Ikkβ-/- cells with an expression vector containing wild type Ikkβ cDNA. Ikkβ siRNA silenced Ikkβ in ∼40-50% of wt cells as determined by a fluorescent staining for IKKβ protein. Although there was no remarkable morphological change in these cells where Ikkβ was silenced by Ikkβ siRNA, the majority of Ikkβ-silenced cells exhibited an increased ratio between the long and short axes (pointed by red arrows in Fig. 5A). In Ikkβ-/- cells, re-expression of Ikkβ partially reversed the protrusive phonotype in ∼20% of the cells (Fig. 5B, Ikkβ-transfected panel). Reactive Oxygen Species Mediate Morphological and Mobility Changes in Ikkβ-/- Cells—Recent studies demonstrated that deficiency in Ikkβ or NF-κB relA gene caused a spontaneous elevation of ROS, especially H2O2, and a sustained stressinduced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (9Chen F. Castranova V. Li Z. Karin M. Shi X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7689-7693PubMed Google Scholar, 25Maeda S. Kamata H. Luo J.L. Leffert H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 121: 977-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 27Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This increase in ROS generation might be a result of either enhanced expression of cytochrome P-450 1b1 (9Chen F. Castranova V. Li Z. Karin M. Shi X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7689-7693PubMed Google Scholar) or a decrease in the expression of an antioxidant protein, ferritin heavy chain (28Pham C.G. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Jones J. Alvarez K. Jayawardena S. De Smaele E. Cong R. Beaumont C. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Franzoso G. Cell. 2004; 119: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that the increased invasion and migration of the Ikkβ-/- cells might be a result of oxidative stress or JNK activation. Analysis of H2O2 generation confirmed our previous findings, which showed that Ikkβ-/- cells are ∼2-3-fold more potent than wt cells in H2O2 generation, and this correlates with the increased expression of cyp1b1, a P-450 family member involved in the cellular oxidative stress responses (Fig. 5, C and D). Conversely, the Ikkβ-/- cells are less efficient at migration when they were treated with 20 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) for 12 h (Fig. 5E). However, the JNK inhibitor (SP600125) failed to inhibit the migration of these Ikkβ-/- cells, despite the fact that previous studies suggested a prolonged activation of JNK in Ikkβ-/- cells. The alterations in cell morphology and mobility of the Ikkβ-/- cells resemble the processes of EMT during tumorigenesis or embryogenesis (24Lee J.M. Dedhar S. Kalluri R. Thompson E.W. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). The key molecules regulating EMT include the transcription factor snail and the tight junction protein E-cadherin, which are inversely correlated. To determine whether deficiency in Ikkβ affects these EMT markers, we measured the protein levels of snail and E-cadherin, respectively. Comparing to wt cells, the Ikkβ-/- cells exhibited an increased expression of snail and a decreased expression of E-cadherin (Fig. 5F). Treatment of the Ikkβ-/- cells with antioxidant, NAC, reduced the level of snail protein and reversed the inhibition of E-cadherin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5F). Thus, these data clearly suggested to us that ROS played a central role in mediating Ikkβ deficiency-induced changes in cell migration through affecting the levels of snail and, subsequently, the expression of E-cadherin. We observed that Ikkβ deficiency promotes morphological changes and enhances cells migration and invasion, which might result from the accumulation of ROS. The Ikkβ-/- cells also exhibited an increased expression of snail, a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. Elimination of ROS by supplying the cells with NAC reduced Ikkβ-/- cell migration significantly, possibly through blocking snail expression and subsequently, derepressing the expression of E-cadherin. Inhibition of JNK, on the other hand, appears to be unable to suppress the increased migration rate of the Ikkβ-/- cells. This was not surprising because an enhanced activation of JNK in Ikkβ-/- cells could be seen only in cellular response to stress but not under the basal condition (9Chen F. Castranova V. Li Z. Karin M. Shi X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7689-7693PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for this is that JNK might be a minor rather than a major factor contributing to the mobilization of the Ikkβ-/- cells, although involvement of JNK in cytoskeletal reorganization had been demonstrated in some other experimental systems (29Xia Y. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 94-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The most important function of IKKβ is its kinase activity for the activation of NF-κB transcription factor. Indeed, a substantial decrease in the basal NF-κB activation was observed in Ikkβ-/- cells (30Zheng X. Zhang Y. Chen Y.Q. Castranova V. Shi X. Chen F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It was very likely, therefore, that the observed changes in cell motility and proliferation of Ikkβ-/- cells were due to impaired basal activation of NF-κB. Several lines of evidence support this possibility. First, both Ikkβ-/- and NF-κB relA-/- cells showed an enhancement of ROS generation spontaneously or in response to stress (9Chen F. Castranova V. Li Z. Karin M. Shi X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7689-7693PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). ROS are potent activators of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases required for the assembly of actin filaments and the cell motility. ROS are also tumorigenic by virtue of their ability to induce genetic lesions and cell proliferation (31Chen F. Shi X. Crit Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 42: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Second, a decreased expression in IGFBP2, TIMPs, and cell adhesion moleculars in Ikkβ-/- cells (Table 1) is in agreement with earlier reports suggesting NF-κB-dependent expression of IGFBP2, TIMP-3, integrin, and VCAM (20Cazals V. Nabeyrat E. Corroyer S. de Keyzer Y. Clement A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Eichten A. Rud D.S. Grace M. Piboonniyom S.O. Zacny V. Munger K. Virology. 2004; 319: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Sun Y. Hegamyer G. Kim H. Sithanandam K. Li H. Watts R. Colburn N.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 6: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because IGFBP2 is a key component of the major inhibitory factors of cell mitogenesis, decreased expression of this protein may help in explaining the faster proliferation rate of the Ikkβ-/- cells. Lastly, cells derived from NF-κB relA-/- mice exhibited a spindled morphology and transformative phenotype (35Gapuzan M.E. Schmah O. Pollock A.D. Hoffmann A. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6574-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Gapuzan M.E. Yufit P.V. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2484-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which morphologically resembles Ikkβ-/- cells as presented in this report. However, it will be too simple to attribute all of these changes in Ikkβ-/- cells to the lack of basal NF-κB activity. Some alternations, such as the increased expression of cardiac ankyrin repeat protein and actin filament-regulating proteins, cannot be explained by the impairment of NF-κB. In addition, IKKβ might modulate cellular responses in a NF-κB-independent manner. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is from the fact that IKKβ can directly phosphorylate 14-3-3β (37Gringhuis S.I. Garcia-Vallejo J.J. van Het Hofqq B. van Dijk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6454-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), dok1 (38Lee S. Andrieu C. Saltel F. Destaing O. Auclair J.

Tanaka T. Saito M. Hemmi H. Ohara O. Akira S. Kaisho T. Nature. 2006; 440: 949-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These additional substrates of IKKβ might be important in the regulation of cell proliferation and/or motility. The appearance of the Ikkβ-/- cells in morphology and mobility is similar to the cells undergoing EMT during tumorigenesis (24Lee J.M. Dedhar S. Kalluri R. Thompson E.W. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). The mesenchymal cells generally have a more extended and elongated shape without regimented structure or tight intercellular adhesion. Because of a weakened cell-to-cell or cell-to-matrix adhesion, the mesenchymal cells are more motile and invasive than their epithelial counterparts. Thus, the EMT has been considered as a key step in tumor metastasis. Although a number of molecules, including snails, cadherins, and vimentin, have been implicated as critical regulators of EMT, a detailed signaling pathway of EMT has not been fully elucidated so far. A major breakthrough in understanding the molecular mechanisms of EMT was made recently by demonstrating the contribution of ROS to EMT in mammary epithelial cells (41Radisky D.C. Levy D.D. Littlepage L.E. Liu H. Nelson C.M. Fata J.E. Leake D. Godden E.L. Albertson D.G. Nieto M.A. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) induces expression of an alternatively spliced Rac1, Rac1b, leading to intracellular accumulation of ROS. Blockade of ROS by SOD2 or NAC inhibited MMP-3-induced cell motility, invasion, and morphological changes (41Radisky D.C. Levy D.D. Littlepage L.E. Liu H. Nelson C.M. Fata J.E. Leake D. Godden E.L.

Accordingly, the data in this report are consistent with these findings, suggesting that a rise in intracellular ROS levels mediates changes of morphology, mobility, and the expression of snail and E-cadherin in the cells where IKKβ or NF-κB is deficient. Furthermore, evidence complementarily supporting this notion is the observation of a diminished expression of TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 in Ikkβ-/- cells (Table 1). Both TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 are major inhibitors for MMP-3 in a given cell or tissue. It is anticipatable, therefore, that a decrease in TIMPs will result in an elevation of MMP-3 activity, leading to an excessive generation of ROS. From the long list of its target genes to the unprecedented role in cell migration and proliferation, the effect of IKK-NF-κB in cellular behaviors is still somehow controversial. Sustained activation of NF-κB by a ubiquitous deletion of IκBα in mice causes premalignant hematopoietic proliferation (42Rupec R.A. Jundt F. Rebholz B. Eckelt B. Weindl G. Herzinger T. Flaig M.J. Moosmann S. Plewig G. Dorken B. Forster I. Huss R. Pfeffer K. Immunity. 2005; 22: 479-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Deletion of Ikkβ in intestinal epithelial cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of inflammation-dependent adenomas (43Greten F.R. Eckmann L. Greten T.F. Park J.M. Li Z.W. Egan L.J. Kagnoff M.F. Karin M. Cell. 2004; 118: 285-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). In collaboration of the Ha-Ras oncoprotein and transforming growth factor-β, NF-κB appears to be a key factor for the induction and maintenance of EMT during mammary carcinogenesis (44Huber M.A. Azoitei N. Baumann B. Grunert S. Sommer A. Pehamberger H. Kraut N. Beug H. Wirth T. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In numerous cellular experimental systems, unequivocal evidence indicates that IKK-NF-κB pathway promotes tumorigenesis or oncogenesis (44Huber M.A. Azoitei N. Baumann B. Grunert S. Sommer A. Pehamberger H. Kraut N. Beug H. Wirth T. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 47Chen F. Castranova V. Shi X. Demers L.M. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Thus, the data presented in this report are somehow provocative to the established role of IKK or NF-κB played in the development of the human cancers. The protrusive and invasive phenotype of the Ikkβ-/- cells implied a possible suppressive effect of Ikkβ or its downstream target, NF-κB, on tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. A similar conclusion had been made earlier from studying relA-/- epidermal cells, which showed that NF-κB antagonized proliferative signals derived from TNFR1 and JNK (48Zhang J.Y. Green C.L. Tao S. Khavari P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Congruously, inhibition of NF-κB in the murine epidermis by either targeted overexpression of a super-repressor form of IκBα or pharmacological agent induced epidermal hyperplasia or squamous cell carcinomas (49Rozell B.L. van Hogerlinden M. Ahrlund-Richter L. Toftgard R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3299-3303PubMed Google Scholar, 50Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In human keratinocytes, NF-κB appeared to be a repressor for the cell cycle transition because blockade of NF-κB produced large and invasive neoplasms resembling human squamous cell carcinomas (51Dajee M. Lazarov M. Zhang J.Y. Cai T. Green C.L. Russell A.J. Marinkovich M.P. Tao S. Lin Q. Kubo Y. Khavari P.A. Nature. 2003; 421: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Most recently, a study using mice with hepatocyte cell-specific deletion in the Ikkβ gene demonstrated that lacking Ikkβ in hepatocytes promotes chemical carcinogen-induced hepato-carcinogenesis (25Maeda S. Kamata H. Luo J.L. Leffert H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 121: 977-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Therefore, a careful re-evaluation is certainly required to define the role of NF-κB on the various stages of malignant transformation and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2059515337,"Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS), an aggressive skeletal muscle cancer, carries a unique t(2;13) chromosomal translocation resulting in the formation of a chimeric transcription factor PAX3-FKHR. This fusion protein contains the intact DNA-binding domains (PD: paired box binding domain; HD: paired-type homeodomain) of Pax3 fused to the activation domain of FKHR. Cells expressing Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR show vastly different gene expression patterns, despite that they share the same DNA-binding domains. We present evidence of a gain of function mechanism that allows the fusion protein to recognize and transcriptionally activate response elements containing a PD-specific binding site. This DNA recognition specificity is in contrast to the requirement for Pax3-specific target sequences that must contain a composite of PD-and HD-binding sites. Domain swapping studies suggest that an increased structural flexibility could account for the relaxed DNA targeting specificity in PAX3-FKHR. Here, we identify myogenin gene as a direct target of PD-dependent PAX3-FKHR activation pathway in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that PAX3-FKHR could induce myogenin expression in undifferentiated myoblasts by a MyoD independent pathway, and that PAX3-FKHR is directly involved in myogenin expression in aRMS cells."

Here, we further investigated the regulation of PLD2 gene expression by EWS/Fli-1 and Fli-1 in another EWS cell line, and also in EWS/Fli-1- or Fli-1-transfected cell line. EWS/Fli-1- or Fli-1-overexpressed cells showed higher PLD2 but not PLD1 protein expression and enhanced cell proliferation as compared to mock transfectant. The treatment of these cells with 1-butanol or siRNA of PLD2 inhibited cell growth, suggesting the pivotal role of PLD in cell growth promotion. PLD2 but not PLD1 mRNA level was also increased in EWS/Fli-1 or Fli-1-transfectants. After determining the transcription initiation points, we cloned the 5' promoter of both PLD1 and PLD2 and analysed promoter activities. Results showed that EWS/Fli-1 and Fli-1 increase PLD2 gene expression by binding to an erythroblast transformation-specific domain (-126 to -120 bp from the transcription initiation site) of PLD2 promoter, which is the minimal and most powerful region. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay using truncated proteins showed that both DNA-binding domain and trans-activating domain were necessary for the enhanced gene expression of PLD2."

MCR also appears to initiate anaerobic methane oxidation (reverse methanogenesis). At the active site of MCR is coenzyme F430, a nickel tetrapyrrole. This paper describes the reaction of the active MCRred1 state with the potent inhibitor, 3-bromopropanesulfonate (BPS; I50 = 50 nm) by UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy and by steady-state and rapid kinetics. BPS was shown to be an alternative substrate of MCR in an ionic reaction that is coenzyme B-independent and leads to debromination of BPS and formation of a distinct state (“MCRPS”) with an EPR signal that was assigned to a Ni(III)-propylsulfonate species (Hinderberger, D., Piskorski, R.

A similar EPR signal was generated by reacting MCRred1 with several halogenated sulfonate and carboxylate substrates. In rapid chemical quench experiments, the propylsulfonate ligand was identified by NMR spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography as propanesulfonic acid after protonolysis of the MCRPS complex. Propanesulfonate formation was also observed in steady-state reactions in the presence of Ti(III) citrate. Reaction of the alkylnickel intermediate with thiols regenerates the active MCRred1 state and eliminates the propylsulfonate group, presumably as the thioether. MCRPS is catalytically competent in both the generation of propanesulfonate and reformation of MCRred1.

HSCoB serves as the two-electron donor (3Ellermann J. Kobelt A. Pfaltz A. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At the active site of MCR is a nickel tetrapyrrolic cofactor called coenzyme F430 that is central to catalysis (4Diekert G. Klee B. Thauer R.K. Arch.

Wolfe R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies reveal that coenzyme F430 binds noncovalently to MCR at the bottom of a 30-Å hydrophobic channel (7Ermler U. Grabarse W. Shima S. Goubeaud M. Thauer R.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2639-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MCRox1 appears to be the only state that can be converted in vitro to active MCRred1, which is accomplished by incubating the MCRox1 state with a strong reductant, titanium(III) citrate (Ti(III) citrate) (10Goubeaud M. Schreiner G. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).

MCRox1 can be formed when the gas medium of growing cells is switched before harvesting from 80% H2, 20% CO2 to 80% N2, 20% CO2 (8Albracht S.P.J. Ankel-Fuchs D. Böcher R. Ellermann J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2639-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). High resolution crystal structures for three EPR-silent and inactive Ni(II) states of this enzyme have been determined: MCRsilent, MCRox1-silent, and MCRred1-silent (7Ermler U. Grabarse W. Shima S.

These states have several common features: the central nickel atom of F430 is coordinated by four planar tetrapyrrole nitrogen atoms and a lower axial oxygen ligand contributed by the carbonyl oxygen of the side chain of Gln-α′147. In the Ni(II)silent form of MCR, the upper axial nickel ligand is the sulfonate oxygen of CoBS-SCoM, whereas, in the Ni(II)ox1-silent form, this site is occupied by the thiol(ate) group of CoM-S(H) (Fig. 1) (7Ermler U.

Cosper N.J. Mahlert F. Thauer R.K. Scott R.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or six-coordinate with two axial ligands coordinated through an oxygen atom (18Tang Q. Carrington P.E. Horng Y.-C. Maroney M.J. Ragsdale S.W. Bocian D.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13242-13256Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The coordination state of MCRred1 needs to be resolved, because having an open upper axial site would poise the Ni(I) for reaction with substrate, whereas an axial ligand would need to be replaced/removed before reaction could occur. Kinetic studies using several small molecules (CHCl3, CH2Cl2, and NO) and substrate analogs (including 3-bromopropanesulfonate (BPS)) support the requirement for ligand exchange (19Singh K. Horng Y.C. Ragsdale S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2436-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); however, further studies are important in resolving this mechanistic question. Two radically different mechanisms have been proposaled for the catalytic mechanism of MCR. In Mechanism I, Ni(I)-MCRred1 reacts with the methyl group of methyl-SCoM, forming a methyl-Ni(III) or methyl-Ni(II) intermediate (20Berkessel A. Biorganic Chem. 1991; 19: 101-115Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Jaun B. Helv. Chem. Acta. 1990; 73: 2209-2216Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Signor L. Knuppe C. Hug R. Schweizer B.

Although the corresponding methyl-nickel species has not been observed on the enzyme, methane formation from the reaction of Ni(I)-derivatives of F430 and activated methyl donors like methylsulfonium ions has been observed (24Lin S.-K. Jaun B. Helv. Chem. Acta. 1992; 75: 1478-1490Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and a methyl-Ni(II) form of the pentamethyl ester of F430 has been characterized by NMR methods (25Lin S.-K. Jaun B. Helv. Chem. Acta. 1991; 74: 1725-1738Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reacting Ni(I)-octaethylisobacteriochlorin (a structural cousin of F430) with various alkyl halides generates alkyl-Ni(III) species that undergo reduction to the alkyl-Ni(II) followed by protonolysis to yield the corresponding alkane (26Lahiri G.K. Stolzenberg A.M. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 4409-4413Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 4In these reactions, a stoichiometry of 2 Ni(I)/alkyl halide was observed, indicating reduction of the alkyl-Ni(III) to the alkyl-Ni(II) state before protonolysis. 4In these reactions, a stoichiometry of 2 Ni(I)/alkyl halide was observed, indicating reduction of the alkyl-Ni(III) to the alkyl-Ni(II) state before protonolysis. On the basis of a computational study using density function theory (DFT), the proposed methyl-nickel species was considered to not be a feasible intermediate in methane synthesis, and Mechanism II was proposed as an alternative to Mechanism I (27Pelmenschikov V. Blomberg M.R.A. Siegbahn P.E.M. Crabtree R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 4039-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The key steps of Mechanism II include nucleophilic attack by Ni(I)-MCRred1 on methyl-SCoM to form a nickel-thiolate complex and a methyl radical, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from HSCoB to generate methane (27Pelmenschikov V. Blomberg M.R.A. Siegbahn P.E.M. Crabtree R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 4039-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, it has been difficult to distinguish between these mechanisms, mainly because we have so far been unable to observe any spectrally distinct intermediates by rapid kinetics. 5Y.-C.

Another complication is that MCRred1-catalyzed cleavage of the C-S bond of methyl-SCoM requires the other substrate, HSCoB, even under single turnover conditions (23Horng Y.-C. Becker D.F. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12875-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the studies described here, we used BPS as a substrate analog, because, unlike methyl-SCoM, reduction of BPS in a single turnover reaction does not require the other substrate HSCoB; furthermore, EPR and UV-visible changes can be observed. When MCRred1 and MCRred2 are incubated with BPS, their EPR signals convert to the MCRPS signal, which does not exhibit measurable halogen-Ni(I) interaction (28Rospert S. Voges M. Berkessel A. Albracht S.P.J. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and has been assigned to a high spin Ni(II)/alkyl radical species (29Goenrich M. Mahlert F. Duin E.C. Bauer C. Jaun B. Thauer R.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 9: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we show that this EPR spectroscopic change is accompanied by formation of an “MCRox1-like” UV-visible spectrum and the reduction of BPS to propanesulfonate. Materials and Organisms—M. marburgensis (f. M. thermoauotrophicum strain Marburg) was obtained from the Oregon Collection of Methanogens catalogue as OCM82. All buffers, media ingredients, and other reagents were acquired from Sigma and, unless otherwise stated, were of the highest purity available. Solutions were prepared using Nanopure deionized water. N2 (99.98%), H2S (99.0%), CO (99.99%), argon (99.8%), H2/CO2 (80%/20%), and ultrahigh purity H2 (99.999%) were obtained from Linweld (Lincoln, NE). Methyl-SCoM was prepared from coenzyme M and methyl iodide (30Gunsalus R.P. Romesser J.A. Wolfe R.S. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2374-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). After methyl-SCoM was crystallized twice in acetone, its purity was checked by 1H NMR spectroscopy. CoBS-SCoB was prepared as described from 7-bromoheptanoic acid (Karl Industries, Aurora, OH), N-hydroxysuccinamide, and o-phospho-l-threonine (31Bobik T.A. Wolfe R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HSCoB was generated from CoBS-SCoB by anaerobic reduction with NaBH4 (33Ellermann J. Hedderich R. Böcher R. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and its purity was ascertained by HPLC. The concentration of HSCoB was checked routinely with Ellman's reagent (34Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) before using it. Ti(III) citrate solutions were prepared from a stock solution of 200 mm Ti(III) citrate, which was synthesized by adding sodium citrate to Ti(III) trichloride (30 weight % solution in 2 n hydrochloric acid) (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ) under anaerobic conditions and adjusting the pH to 7.0 with sodium bicarbonate (35Zehnder A.J.B. Wuhrmann K. Science. 1976; 194: 1165-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The concentration of Ti(III) citrate was determined routinely by titrating a methyl viologen solution. M. marburgensis Growth, Harvest, and Purification Conditions—M. marburgensis was cultured on H2/CO2/H2S (80%/20%/0.1%) at 65 °C in a 14-liter fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) (10Goubeaud M. Schreiner G. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 36Schönheit P. Moll J. Thauer R.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 127: 59-65Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Culture media were prepared as previously described (36Schönheit P. Moll J. Thauer R.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 127: 59-65Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Once the culture had reached late log phase (A578 ∼ 3.0), sodium sulfide was added directly to the growing cells (final sulfide concentration, 20 mm) prior to harvesting as described (11Becker D.F. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2639-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After 15 min at 65 °C, the culture was cooled to 25 °C within 30 min and harvested anaerobically. MCRred1 used in Figs. 2, 5, 8, 9, S1, and S2 was isolated (details below) from M. marburgensis cultured on H2/CO2/H2S (80%/20%/0.1%) at 65 °C in a 14-liter fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific) (10Goubeaud M. Schreiner G. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 36Schönheit P. Moll J. Thauer R.K. Arch.

Microbiol. 1980; 127: 59-65Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar). MCRred1 was generated in vivo as described with the following modifications (8Albracht S.P.J. Ankel-Fuchs D. Böcher R. Ellermann J.

Chem. 2002; 7: 500-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Once the culture had reached A578 ∼ 4.0, the H2/CO2/H2S (80%/20%/0.1%) was switched to H2/CO2 (80%/20%). 30 min after the H2S gas flow was turned off, the CO2/H2 (20%/80%) was switched to 100% H2. After purging for 20 min with 100% H2 at 65 °C, the cells were cooled to ∼20 °C within 10 min. After purging the cells with 100% H2 for a total of 30 min, the cells were harvested anaerobically, and gas pressure was used to transfer the cells from the fermentor into a Cepa LE cell harvester (New Brunswick Scientific). After harvesting the cells, the rotor was immediately moved into the anaerobic chamber. The cells were removed from the rotor and resuspended in 200 ml (total volume) of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm Ti(III) citrate, and 10 mm HSCoM (lysis buffer). The resuspended cells were aliquoted (50-ml aliquots) into four 100-ml serum vials (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) fitted with butyl rubber stoppers (Bellco Glass Inc., Vineland, NJ) and crimp-sealed with aluminum caps (Bellco Glass Inc.). The resuspended cells were placed under a 100% H2 atmosphere by purging the headspace of the seal serum vials with 100% H2 for 5 min, followed by vigorously shaking the resuspended cells by hand for 30 s and then purging with 100% H2 for an additional 5 min. The serum vials were inverted to minimize H2 escape, and the cells were kept under 10 p.s.i. of 100% H2 at room temperature with replacement of the H2 atmosphere every 6-8 h. EPR spectroscopy was used to monitor in vivo generation of MCRred1 by drawing a 200-μl subsample of resuspended whole cells every 6-8 h. To remove trace amounts of oxygen in the H2 line entering the anaerobic chamber, the line was fitted with a high pressure Oxy-Trap oxygen scrub (Alltech) followed by an indicating Oxy-Trap (Alltech) to monitor the efficiency/remaining capacity of the oxygen scrub. The cells were processed when the EPR intensity of MCRred1 stopped increasing, typically 24 h after cell harvest. MCRred1 and MCRox1 were purified under strictly anaerobic conditions at 17 °C in a Vacuum Atmospheres chamber maintained below 1 ppm oxygen, monitored continually with a Teledyne oxygen analyzer (model 317; Teledyne Analytical Instruments, City of Industry, CA).FIGURE 51H NMR evidence for propanesulfonate formation from MCRred1 and BPS. A, a solution containing 0.169 mm MCRred1 and 0.1 mm Ti(III) citrate in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6 (syringe 1) was reacted with 0.069 mm BPS in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6 (syringe 2). B, a solution containing 0.2 mm Ti(III) citrate in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6 (syringe 1) was reacted with 0.069 mm BPS in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, in the absence of MCR. 1H chemical shifts for PS and BPS as determined by pure standards were as follows: 1.02(t), 1.75(m), and 2.90(t); 2.29 (m), 3.08(t), and 3.61(t) ppm, respectively. In B, the BPS signal at 3.61 ppm was not seen due to overlap with the solvent peak. The insets in A and B show the 0.5-2.0 ppm region.

MCRPS (12.2 μm) was incubated with 4 mm HSCoM, 0.5 m TAPS buffer (pH 10.0) at 25 °C. The decay of MCRPS (420 nm) and the formation of MCRred1 (385 nm) were followed by UV-visible spectroscopy; each spectrum represents a 30-s time interval. The rate constants (0.0067 ± 0.0001 s-1 for MCRPS and 0.0067 ± 0.0004 s-1 for MCRred1) were obtained by fitting the data with single exponential equations. Inset, the second order rate constant 3.99 ± 0.65 m-1 s-1 (kmax 0.011 ± 0.001 s-1 and Km 2.81 ± 0.40 mm) was calculated by plotting first order rates versus various HSCoM concentrations while keeping the MCRPS concentration constant and fitting the data with a two-parameter hyperbolic equation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 9MCRPS is converted to MCRsilent in the presence of Ti(III) citrate.

Schreiner G. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For experiments requiring high concentrations of MCR, MCRox1 was concentrated in a 50-ml ultrafiltration stirred cell (Amicon; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) with a 30 kDa molecular mass cut-off filter using high pressure argon that had been passed through an oxisorb column (Oxyclear; Supelco) to remove oxygen. MCRred1 used for the experiments presented in Figs. 2, 5, 8, 9, S1, and S2 was purified as described with the following modifications (10Goubeaud M. Schreiner G. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The pellet from the 100% ammonium sulfate fractionation was resuspended in 60 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm HSCoM, 0.1 mm Ti(III) citrate (buffer A). The resuspended 100% ammonium sulfate pellet was applied at a flow rate of 5 ml/min to a 1.6 × 25-cm high performance Q-Sepharose (Sigma) column (C 16/40 column fitted with an AC 16 flow adapter (GE Health)) equilibrated in buffer A. After loading the resuspended pellet, the column was washed with 60 ml of buffer A, and protein was eluted with a step gradient of 0.44 m NaCl in buffer A (60 ml) followed by 0.55 m NaCl in buffer A (90 ml). Five-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for MCRred1 by UV-visible spectroscopy. MCR isoenzyme I typically eluted at the beginning of the 0.55 m NaCl step. The most concentrated fractions were transferred to separate 9-ml serum vials (Alltech) and stoppered with butyl rubber stoppers (Bellco). The serum vials were stored in the anaerobic chamber on ice packs in Styrofoam containers. In this way, MCRred1 can be stored in the anaerobic chamber for 3-4 months before losing all activity. This purification method routinely generates 50-80% MCRred1 as determined by UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy. Spectroscopy of MCR—UV-visible spectra of MCR were recorded in the anaerobic chamber using a diode array spectrophotometer (model DT 1000A; Analytical Instrument Systems, Inc., Flemingron, NJ). EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer recently upgraded to an EMX, equipped with"
https://openalex.org/W2032712705,"The drug hydroxyurea (HU) is used for cancer therapy and treatment of sickle cell anemia. It inhibits cell cycle progression by blocking DNA synthesis and drives cells to undergo apoptosis or enter senescence. We demonstrate here that HU induces the expression of two AP-1 proteins, c-Jun and JunB, which exert antagonistic effects on the cell cycle. Moreover, the induction of c-Jun is observed following treatment with two other drugs that inhibit the cell cycle in S phase, aphidicolin and camptothecin. The induction of c-Jun, which promotes cell cycle progression, up-regulates expression of cyclin D after exposure of cells to HU. Deficiency in c-jun prevents elevation of cyclin D expression and extends entrance into HU-induced senescence but also renders cells more resistant to HU-dependent apoptosis. The induction of c-Jun is independent of JNK activity, and additionally, of c-Jun autoregulatory activity but is inhibited upon inhibition of protein kinase C activity. Therefore, we suggest that c-Jun activity prevents drug-induced senescence. Conversely, the JunB target gene, tumor suppressor p16INK4a, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor essential for the induction of drug-induced senescence, is also up-regulated by HU in a JunB-dependent manner. Constitutive expression of JunB up-regulates p16INK4a and increases the sensitivity of mouse fibroblasts to drug-induced-senescence. Thus, we suggest that in contrast to c-Jun, JunB drives cells to enter HU-dependent senescence. The effect of HU treatment, which regulates the intricate web of AP-1 transcription, depends on the balance between c-Jun and JunB activities."
https://openalex.org/W2013588642,"Germ cell-specific genes are active in oocytes and spermatocytes but are silent in all other cell types. To understand the basis for this seemingly simple pattern of regulation, we characterized factors that recognize the promoter-proximal region of the germ cell-specific TFIIAα/β-like factor (ALF) gene. Two of the protein-DNA complexes formed with liver extracts (C4 and C5) are due to the zinc finger proteins Sp1 and Sp3, respectively, whereas another complex (C6) is due to the transcription factor RFX1. Two additional complexes (C1 and C3) are due to the multivalent zinc finger protein CTCF, a factor that plays a role in gene silencing and chromatin insulation. An investigation of CTCF binding revealed a recognition site of only 17 bp that overlaps with the Sp1/Sp3 site. This site is predictive of other genomic CTCF sites and can be aligned to create a functional consensus. Studies on the activity of the ALF promoter in somatic 293 cells revealed mutations that result in increased reporter activity. In addition, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of CTCF is associated with activation of the endogenous ALF gene, and both CTCF and Sp3 repress the promoter in transient transfection assays. Overall, the results suggest a role for several factors, including the multivalent zinc finger chromatin insulator protein CTCF, in mediating somatic repression of the ALF gene. Release of such repression, perhaps in conjunction with other members of the CTCF, RFX, and Sp1 families of transcription factors, could be an important aspect of germ cell gene activation.

Germ cells express a unique set of core promoter-associated transcription factors that are not found in somatic cells. These include members of the TBP family as well as TBP-associated factors, such as TFIIA and TAFs (1DeJong J.

ALF interacts with the small TFIIAγ subunit to form a complex that can stabilize binding of TBP-like factors to promoter DNA, thereby facilitating formation of a transcription preinitiation complex in germ cells (7Upadhyaya A.B.

Li J. Zhou Z. Du Y. Lin M. Sha J. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 17: 599-604PubMed Google Scholar). An intriguing feature of ALF and other germ cell-specific genes is that the sequences sufficient to exert correct control of expression are very short, on the order of 100 base pairs. For instance, a region of the ALF gene between -133 and +21 relative to the transcription start site is able to recapitulate accurate tissue-specific expression and silencing of a linked reporter in transgenic mice (10Han S.Y. Xie W. Kim S.H. Yue L. DeJong J. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The most notable sequences in this region include a TTCAAA element, a GC-rich region with a number of CpG dinucleotides, and an upstream TC-rich region. Although broadly similar features can be observed in several other germ cell-specific promoters (10Han S.Y. Xie W. Kim S.H. Yue L. DeJong J. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), individual sequences of germ cell promoters are not precisely homologous, and the identification of factors responsible for their regulation remains an important goal. Such factors are expected to control the two main behaviors of germ cell-specific genes: selective activation during germ cell differentiation and somatic silencing. Here we have examined DNA-protein complexes that form on the ALF promoter using mouse liver- and testis-derived nuclear extracts. We show that these complexes are due to the zinc finger proteins, Sp1, Sp3, and CTCF, and to the winged helix transcription factor RFX1. Interestingly, sites for Sp1/Sp3 and CTCF overlap, making this a unique subclass of elements that has dual specificity for both types of factors. The identification of these particular proteins is also of interest because they are all members of larger families of factors that are regulated in complex patterns during gametogenesis (11Klenova E.M.

Its identification as a germ cell promoter binding factor, as described in this report, suggests a possible role in protecting germ cell genes from inappropriate activation by adjacent enhancers active in somatic tissues. Functional data are presented that support the notion that the ALF promoter is repressed in somatic cells, and we speculate that release of repression might be an important aspect of how such genes ultimately turned on. Overall, the results provide insights into the on-off regulation of germ cell gene promoters.

DNA fragments encoding full-length CTCF and an internal zinc domain were amplified from human testis Marathon-ready cDNA (Clontech) with hCTCF-1 (5′-CCGGAATTCATGGAAGGTGATGCAGTCGAA-3′) and hCTCF-2 (5′-GGGAAGCTTTCACCGGTCCATCATGCTGAG-3′) and with hCTCFZn-1 (CCGGAATTCATGAAGCCTCCAAAGCCAACA-3′) and hCTCFZn-2 (5′-GGGAAGCTTTCATGGGCCAGCACAATTATCAGC-3′). PCR products were digested with EcoRI and HindIII, purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and cloned into pGEM-HE (23Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Constructs were translated in the TNT Quick coupled transcription and translation kit (Promega). In brief, 2 μg of DNA was mixed with TNT master mix and methionine and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Bandshift Analysis—Binding reactions were typically performed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 8% glycerol, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, and 80 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and resolved on 5% native polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× TBE and 5% glycerol. Some reactions contained antibodies raised against CTCF (C terminus) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), CTCF (N terminus) (BD Biosciences), Sp1 (Upstate Biotechnology), Sp3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or RFX1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Promoter Constructs and Expression Vectors—The wild type ALF promoter and a series of eight mutant derivatives were prepared by PCR. For wild type (WT) and mutant 5 to mutant 7 (M5-M7), the reactions contained primer PF0 (5′-TGGTACCCTTGCCCGGTCCTACTCAG-3′) together with one of four primers: PR0 (5′-GAGATCTAACCGTTTGCGCCTGCGTG-3′), PR5 (5′-GAGATCTAACCGTTTGCGCCTGCGTGGCAGAGAGCCGCCAGGCTCGCTAAACCCAACAGGGTCCTCGTTGC-3′), PR6 (5′-GAGATCTAACCGTTTGCGCCTGCGTGGCAGAGAGAACAACCCAACGCTTTTGAACCG-3′), or PR7 (5′-GAGATCTAACCGTTTGCGCCGTGTGTTGTTAGAGCCGCCAGG-3′). For mutant 1 to mutant 4 (M1-M4), the reactions contained primer PR0 as showed above and one of the three primers: PF1 (5′-TGGTACCCTTGCCGTTGGGGTGGCAGCTCCGCCCCC-3′), PF2 (5′-TGGTACCCTTGCCCGGTCCTACTCAGCAAACAAAAACGCGGCCTCGCGGT-3′), PF3 (5′-TGGTACCCTTGCCCGGTCCTACTCAGCTCCGCCCCCAGCGGAAAACACCAAGCGCAGCAACGAG-3′), or PF4 (5′-TGGTACCCTTGCCCGGTCCTACTCAGCTCCGCCCCCAGCGGCCTCGCGGTTGCGCTTGTTGTTTTACCCACGGTTCAA-3′). For mutant CG (MCG), the reaction contained primers PFCG (5′-TGGTACCCTTGCCGTGTCCTACTCAGCTCGTCCCCCAGGTGCCTGTGTGTTGGTCAGCAACGAGGA-3′) and PRCG (5′-GAGATCTAACACTTTGACCCTGACTGGCAGAGAGCACCCAGGCTACCTTTTGAACACTGGGTCCTCGTT-3′). KpnI and BglII sites were added to the primer ends to facilitate cloning, and the amplified fragments were inserted upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL3 Enhancer (Promega). To make expression constructs for CTCF (pFCMV-CTCF), BORIS (pFCMV-BORIS), Sp1 (pFCMV-Sp1), and Sp3 (pFCMV-Sp3), open reading frames for each factor were amplified from human testis RNA using hCTCF-Full-1 (5′-CCGGAATTCCGAAGGTGATGCAGTCGAAGCC-3′), hCTCF-Full-2 (5′-CGCGGATCCTCACCGGTCCATCATGCTGAG-3′), hBO-RIS-FLAG-1 (5′-CGATGAATTCGCAGCCACTGAGATCTC-TGT-3′), hBORIS-FLAG-2 (5′-CGTGGGATCCTCACTTATCCATCGTGTTGAG-3′), hSp1-FLAG-1 (5′-CGGCGAATTCAGCGACCAAGATCACTCCAT-3′), hSp1-FLAG-2 (5′-CGGCTCTAGATCAGAAGCCATTGCCACTGA-3′), hSp3-FLAG-1 (5′-CGTGGAATTCACCGCTCCCGAAAAGCCCGT-3′), and hSp3-FLAG-2 (5′-CGGCGGATCCTTACTCCATTGTCTCATTTCC-3′). The amplified open reading frames were cloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma), except Sp1, which was cloned into EcoRI and XbaI sites. A mouse ALF promoter (200 bp) was amplified with mALFpro200-Luc-1 (5′-CGTGGGTACCTAAAGTTGGTTGTACGCCTTAC-3′) and mALFpro200-Luc-2 (5′-CATTCTCGAGGCCAGCCGCTCTGTGCCTAA-3′) and was cloned into KpnI and XhoI sites of the pGL3 Enhancer vector (Promega). All plasmids were sequenced. RNA Interference—NIH3T3 cells were trypsinized and distributed into 6-well plates without antibiotics at 2 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected with CTCF-specific (Dharmacon) or negative control siRNAs (Ambion) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The concentration of siRNA that gave the least cell deterioration was 0.58 μg/well, with each well containing 2 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured for 8 h and then switched to media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic solution. Transfections—293 cells were grown to 50-80% confluence on 6-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of DNA using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). pGL3 Control and pGL3 Enhancer served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Whole cell extracts were prepared after 48 h, and luciferase activity was assayed using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and a Turner TD-20e luminometer. For cotransfection experiments with pmALFpro200 and individual expression vectors, 293T cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells into 6-well plates. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with expression constructs together with 1 μg of mALF-pro200-Luc construct using the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The pCMV Sport-β-gal vector (100 ng; ATCC) was used to monitor transfection efficiency, and the pGL3 Control and pGL3 Enhancer vectors were used as positive and negative controls. After 48 h, luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed using the luciferase assay system and the β-galactosidase assay kit (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activities. All transfections were performed between three and six times each. Protein-DNA Interactions on the ALF Promoter—A fragment of the mouse ALF promoter from -117 to -5 relative to the major transcription start site (Fig. 1A) was used as a probe in bandshift reactions that contained nuclear extracts from either mouse liver or testis. The probe spanned a region of the promoter previously shown to drive correct regulation in transgenic mice (10Han S.Y. Xie W. Kim S.H. Yue L. DeJong J. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Six major complexes could be resolved using liver extracts (Fig. 1B, lane 1) and were denoted as C1-C6. Three of these complexes were also abundant in testis extracts (C3, C4, and C5) (lane 2). Additional rapidly migrating complexes were less intense or variably present and were not given separate designations. The results depicted are representative of results obtained with several nuclear extract preparations. Zinc Finger Transcription Factors Sp1 and Sp3 Recognize the ALF Promoter—The ALF promoter sequence is relatively GC-rich and contains a GGGCGG element located in reverse orientation relative to the direction of transcription at positions -84 to -79 (Fig. 1A). To test whether members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors might recognize this element and generate some of the observed complexes, we evaluated the ability of an Sp1 site to compete for binding. The results show that both the C4 and C5 complexes seen in liver NE disappeared when this competitor was present (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2), and similar results were observed with the C4 and C5 complexes in testis extracts (lanes 3 and 4). To verify which factors are involved, Sp1- and Sp3-specific antibodies were included in the band-shift reactions. The addition of an anti-Sp1 antibody selectively diminished formation of the C4 complex in both liver (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2) and testis (lanes 3 and 4), consistent with the idea that it contained Sp1. Likewise, the addition of an antibody specific to Sp3 selectively diminished formation of the C5 complex in both types of extracts (Fig. 1D, lanes 6-9). These results demonstrate that the ALF promoter is recognized by the zinc finger transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. The Insulator/Silencer Protein CTCF Recognizes the ALF Promoter—Some zinc finger transcription factors, especially those with multiple fingers, have relatively broad site specificity for GC-rich sequences. An example of such a factor is the chromatin insulator and silencer protein CTCF (11Klenova E.M. Morse H.C. Ohlsson R. Lobanenkov V.V. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 13Ohlsson R. Renkawitz R. Lobanenkov V. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Because it seemed plausible that insulator-like activities might be important for the regulation of germ cell genes in somatic cells, we asked whether CTCF would interact with ALF promoter DNA. To address this question we first synthesized full-length CTCF protein and a zinc finger DNA binding subdomain (CTCF-Zn) using a coupled transcription-translation system. Control experiments showed that programmed lysates generated strong shifts when incubated with a control CTCF site from the chicken β-globin gene (19Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) (data not shown). When lysates programmed with the full-length CTCF were used in reactions with a labeled ALF promoter, two complexes were generated (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Competition experiments with unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to ALF, a consensus cFII site, and an Sp1 site were consistent with the idea that the CTCF-programmed reticulocyte lysate was specifically recognizing an element within the ALF promoter (lanes 2-4). Lysates programmed with the smaller CTCF-Zn fragment generated a strong, more rapidly migrating complex whose properties in competition experiments matched those of its fulllength counterpart (lanes 5-8). In addition, a human ALF promoter probe would also be recognized by the CTCF-Zn protein, albeit more weakly than the mouse probe (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-4). Endogenous CTCF Protein in Liver and Testis Extracts Binds to the ALF Promoter—To directly show that CTCF was responsible for complex formation, we performed supershift reactions using commercially available CTCF-specific antibodies raised against either the N terminus (CTCF N-Ab) or the C terminus (CTCF C-Ab) of CTCF. The N-terminus-specific antibody eliminated formation of both complexes seen with CTCF-programmed lysates, generating an antibody-dependent supershift (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). The C-terminus-specific antibody eliminated the upper complex but not the lower complex (lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the lower of the two complexes lacks a complete C terminus. Neither antibody had an effect on the complexes formed with CTCF-Zn (Fig. 2C, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). We next asked whether complexes formed on the ALF promoter using liver and testis extracts were actually due to endogenous CTCF. This seemed likely, since the large and small complexes observed with recombinant CTCF comigrated with extract-derived complexes C1 and C3 (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2). When the N-terminus-specific CTCF antibody was added to the reaction, the C3 and C1 complexes were supershifted, but no other complex was affected (compare lanes 2 and 3). Similarly, when these antibodies were added to reactions that contained testis extracts, the C3 complex was supershifted (Fig. 2D, lanes 4 and 5). In addition, the C-terminus-specific antibody was also able to abolish formation of the C3 complex in testis extracts (lanes 7 and 8). Since the antibodies used in these experiments do not recognize the male-specific CTCF-like factor BORIS (12Loukinov D.I. Pugacheva E. Vatolin S. Pack S.D. Moon H. Chernukhin I. Mannan P. Larsson E. Kanduri C. Vostrov A.A. Cui H. Niemitz E.L. Rasko J.E.J. Docquier F.M. Kistler M. Breen J.J. Zhuang Z. Quitschke W.W. Renkawitz R. Klenova E.M. Feinberg A.P. Ohlsson R. Morse III, H.C. Lobanenkov V.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 6806-6811Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), the C3 complex observed in whole testis extracts is due to CTCF. We did not observe complexes that were shifted by both the Sp1/Sp3 and CTCF antibodies, suggesting that the probe was not bound by more than one factor. Overall, these results lead to the interesting conclusion that the insulator/silence factor CTCF interacts with an element within the germ cell-specific ALF gene. Localization of Regulatory Factor Binding Sites—To locate the positions at which Sp1, Sp3, and CTCF were bound, we prepared a series of oligonucleotides that contained mutations in the GC box (mut-Sp1), mutations along the length of the sequence (mut 5, mut 3-1, mut 3-2, and mut 3-3), or mutations in selected C or G residues (mut CG to AG, mut CG to CT, mutCtoA, and mutGtoT) (Fig. 3A). These oligonucleotides, together with a wild type control, were then used as competitors for complexes formed with liver NE (Fig. 3B). The results make several important points about regulatory factor interactions along the ALF promoter. First, the mut Sp1 competitor, which contains a mutated GC box, is the only oligonucleotide that could not compete for the C4/C5 complexes (Fig. 3B, lane 7). Thus, we conclude that this site is critical for the binding of both Sp1 and Sp3. Second, the mut 5 and mut 3-2 oli-gonucleotides compete for CTCF binding (lanes 3 and 5), whereas mut Sp1 and mut 3-1 do not compete (lanes 4 and 7). These results thus define a 17-nucleotide CTCF recognition motif that overlaps with the Sp1/Sp3 GC box site at the 5′-side (-84) and extends to position -68 at the 3′-side. The competition results also give a clue to the location of the C6 complex. In particular, the inability of mut 3-2, mut 3-3, mut CG to AG, and mut G to T oligonucleotides to compete for this complex (lanes 5, 6, 8, and 11) places the binding site for this factor just downstream of CTCF. The competition properties of C2 and smaller complexes were either indeterminate or similar to CTCF. The Winged Helix Transcription Factor RFX1 Binds to the Mouse ALF Promoter—Inspection of sequences where complex C6 was formed indicated possible binding sites for C/EBP or RFX factors. Supershift experiments using anti-C/EBP antibodies failed to produce any change (data not shown). On the other hand, a well characterized RFX site from the polyoma virus enhancer was able to eliminate the C6 complex without affecting any of the other complexes (Fig. 3C, lanes 1-3). In addition, an RFX1-specific antibody supershifted the C6 complex, indicating that the C6 complex is due to RFX1. The presence of this complex in testis was very weak, and we do not know if it is due to RFX1 or to other members of the RFX family. Alignment of the RFX site from the ALF promoter with other RFX sites shows a match to a consensus (25Horvath G.C. Kistler W.S. Kistler M.K. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (GTNRCCNNR-GYAAC) at seven of eight positions for which a particular nucleotide is specified and at all three positions where a purine (R) or a pyrimidine (Y) is specified (Fig. 3D). A Minimal CTCF Site and Prediction of Additional Genomic Sites—The results in Fig. 5B showed that mutations on either side of a 17-bp region had no effect on CTCF binding. This was surprising, since the binding site is thought to be relatively long (13Ohlsson R. Renkawitz R. Lobanenkov V. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 24Filippova G.N. Qi C.-F. Ulmer J.E. Moore J.M. Ward M.D. Hu Y.J. Loukinov D.I. Pugacheva E.M.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 48-52PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this point, we synthesized two additional sets of oligonucleotides for use as binding site competitors. Members of one set contained the 17-base pair core but differed in the length of their flanking sequences (Fig. 4A). The second set was composed of natural genomic DNA sequences from mice, humans, cows, dogs, and pigs that had been retrieved in data base homology searches using the 17-base pair sequence as the query. These sequences contain between 15 and 17 base pairs that are identical to the site in the ALF promoter but possess unique flanking sequences (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4A 17-bp CTCF core sequence predicts CTCF interactions. A, oligonucleotides that contained the 17-bp CTCF core binding site defined by the competition analysis of Fig. 5 were synthesized with different lengths of flanking sequences. B, data base identification of naturally occurring sequences from mice, cows, humans, pigs, and dogs that match the 17-bp core sequence. All of the sequences contain a GC box as part of the 17-bp core. C, competition analysis of complexes formed with liver NE shows that flanking sequences are necessary for the 17-bp core CTCF site to function effectively as a CTCF binding site competitor (lanes 2-5). D, naturally occurring sequences that contain the 15-17 bp that exactly match the ALF CTCF core but differ in their flanking sequences are efficient competitors for both Sp1/Sp3 (C4/C5) and CTCF (C1/C3) binding but not for RFX binding (C6) (lanes 2-9). A mouse ALF self-competitor control competes for the same complexes but also abolishes the RFX (C6) complex (lane 10), whereas a mutant Sp1 site competitor control only competes for the RFX (C6) complex (lane 11).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When oligonucleotides from the first set were added to bandshift reactions containing the ALF promoter, we observed a flanking region-dependent competition for CTCF binding (Fig. 4C).

In addition to its redox function in the catalytic reactions of these enzymes, BH4 has regulatory roles, because its cellular concentrations are often limiting. Changes in cellular pools of BH4 therefore dictate the rate of production of key cell-signaling molecules, including dopamine, serotonin, and nitric oxide. The conversion of GTP to 2,4-dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H2NTP), catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH I, EC 3.5.4.16), is the first and rate-limiting reaction in the de novo synthesis of BH4 in all higher eukaryotes (8Brown G.M. Blakely R.J. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. John Wiley and Sons, New York1985: 115-154Google Scholar). The importance of the proper regulation of GTPCH activity and BH4 production is underscored by diseases associated with mutations in the BH4 biosynthetic pathway. Autosomal dominant mutations in the GTPCH gene are associated with 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-responsive dystonia (9Ichinose H. Ohye T. Takahashi E. Seki N. Hori T. Segawa M. Nomura Y. Endo K.

Mammalian GTPCH is regulated by a variety of mechanisms, the best characterized of which is end-product feedback inhibition by BH4 (19Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This inhibition involves the formation of a complex between GTPCH, GTPCH feedback regulatory protein (GFRP), and BH4 (20Milstein S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19743-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Maita N. Okada K. Hirotsu S. Hatakeyama K. Hakoshima T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The consequence of formation of this complex is a decrease in Vmax via a mechanism that is noncompetitive with the GTP substrate (19Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40677-40682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DAHP, accordingly, has been used to induce BH4 deficiencies in animal models of BH4-deficient neurological disease (28Suzuki S. Watanabe Y. Tsubokura S. Kagamiyama H. Hayaishi O. Brain Res. 1988; 446: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as well as hyperphenylalaninemia (29Cotton R.G. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1986; 9: 4-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A second means of negatively regulating GTPCH activity appears to involve the expression of alternative isoforms. In humans, there are at least six alternatively spliced GTPCH mRNAs, with the translated proteins differing only in their C termini, yet only GTPCH type I is enzymatically active (30Gütlich M. Jaeger E. Rücknagel K.P. Werner T. Rödl W. Ziegler I. Bacher A. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Co-expression of GTPCH type I and GTPCH type II, a truncated and non-functional GTPCH protein, in human blood cells depresses the level of GTPCH type I protein (31Hwu W.L. Yeh H.Y. Fang S.W. Chiang H.S. Chiou Y.W. Lee Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether this mechanism is employed more universally for negative regulation of GTPCH in mammalian cells. GTPCH is also positively regulated via post-translational modification. It has been reported that stimulation of GTPCH activity in mammalian cell culture occurs through phosphorylation and that GTPCH serves as a substrate for both casein kinase II and protein kinase C (32Hesslinger C. Kremmer E. Hültner L. Ueffing M. Ziegler I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21616-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 33Lapize C. Plüss C. Werner E.R. Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, specific sites of phosphorylation have not yet been identified in mammalian GTPCH, nor has the effect of phosphorylation been defined enzymatically. The sequence of GTPCH is highly conserved; the Drosophila melanogaster homolog is nearly 80% similar to the mammalian form. Moreover, its reaction mechanism appears to be conserved, as does the decameric structure (34Weisberg E.P. O'Donnell J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1453-1458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This high degree of conservation in a genetic model organism affords the opportunity to investigate, in greater detail, the mechanisms of regulation and their effects on the organism. Drosophila GTPCH is encoded by the gene Punch (Pu), which has been subjected to extensive genetic and molecular analysis (35Mackay W.J. O'Donnell J.M. Genetics. 1983; 105: 35-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Mackay W.J. Reynolds E.R. O'Donnell J.M. Genetics. 1985; 111: 885-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Reynolds R.E. O'Donnell J.M. Genetics. 1988; 119: 609-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Pu locus produces at least four transcripts by alternative promoters and alternative splicing. Three of these, transcripts A (1.70 kb), B (1.75 kb), and C (1.80 kb), are well characterized (38McLean J.R. Krishnakumar S. O'Donnell J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27191-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the predicted sequence for each of the resulting polypeptides is virtually identical to the catalytic core protein in mammals. The GTPCH polypeptides from all species analyzed to date have a non-conserved N-terminal domain that extends as an “arm” from the catalytic core. These arms have been variously proposed to be regulatory domains or docking sites for interacting proteins, although evidence is lacking to confirm these hypotheses. The Drosophila isoforms similarly have non-conserved N-terminal domains (supplemental Fig. S1). The isoforms, however, differ from the mammalian forms in three aspects. First, each has a unique N-terminal domain rather than differing at the C terminus as is the case for the mammalian protein. Second, the N termini are significantly longer than any other characterized GTPCH. Third, unlike the mammalian forms, which seem to be expressed in the same cells, the Drosophila isoforms are expressed in different tissues and at different times during development (36Mackay W.J. Reynolds E.R. O'Donnell J.M. Genetics. 1985; 111: 885-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38McLean J.R. Krishnakumar S. O'Donnell J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27191-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chen X. Reynolds E.R. Ranganayakulu G. O'Donnell J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3501-3513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have undertaken an in vitro analysis of recombinant Drosophila GTPCH isoforms to test for the first time the hypothesis that the N-terminal domains have regulatory functions. The studies reported here demonstrate that each of the Drosophila isoforms is catalytically active, and they provide evidence for a key regulatory region in the N termini of isoforms B and C. We also show that the N-terminal domains of these two isoforms serve as substrates for protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC). Moreover, we obtained two surprising results. First, the distal residues in these arms strongly affect the kinetic properties of the enzymes, suggesting a heretofore unknown regulatory interaction between the arms and the active sites. Second, the N-terminal extensions serve as functional homologs of the mammalian GFRP despite the non-alignment of sequence, in that they are capable of directing non-competitive inhibition by BH4 and DAHP in the absence of GFRP. Cloning of Drosophila GTPCH Isoforms—Cloning of cDNAs corresponding to Drosophila GTPCH isoforms A and B was described previously (38McLean J.R. Krishnakumar S. O'Donnell J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27191-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isoform C cDNA was cloned from a 0- to 24-h Drosophila embryonic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing cDNA clones in the bacteriophage λ ZAP using methods essentially the same as described previously (38McLean J.R. Krishnakumar S. O'Donnell J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27191-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCR Generation and Subcloning of Proteins—To facilitate insertion of the various GTPCH constructs into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen), primers for PCR were designed to include the desired restriction enzyme recognition sites, with the various forward primers containing a site for BamHI digestion and the sole reverse primer containing a HindIII recognition site (5′-ACACAAGCTTTATTTGCTATTGACTAAG-3′). PCR was performed by standard methods. Products of the appropriate size were observed and gel-purified (Stratagene). For subcloning of Drosophila GTPCH isoforms A-C, the following forward primers were used: GTPCH A (5′-GCACTTGGATCCAAGCCCCAGACAAGC-3′); GTPCH B and GTPCH C (5′-TCCAGGATCCAGCTTCACCCGCCAACT-3′). For the common region, the forward primer (5′-GTACTTGGATCCCACGAGAAGTGCACGTTC-3′) was used. For the truncation analysis, the following forward primers were used: -30 isoform C (5′-TCCAGGATCCTCGCGCGGACGCAACAACAG-3′) and -58 isoform C (5′-TCCAGGATCCGAGGAGGCCACTGCCATTGCGGGC-3′). The N-terminal extensions were subcloned using the following reverse primers along with the appropriate forward primers: N-terminal isoform A (5′-GCGTTCAAGCTTGCCGCTTCCATTGCT-3′), N-terminal isoform B (5′-GTTCAAGCTTATCACTATCCGGACTGCTGCC-3′), and N-terminal isoform C (5′-GAGTTCAAGCTTGGCGTTGTCGATGTACG-3′). For site-directed mutagenesis of isoform C, the forward primer (5′-TCCAGGATCCATGAGCTTTACCCGCCAACT-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-ACACAAGCTTTATTTGCTATTGACTAAG-3′) were employed in conjunction with the following primers to incorporate the appropriate codon changes: S37A Forward (5′-CGCGGACGCAACAACGCCGTCTGCTCAACAAGTAG-3′), S37A Reverse (5′-CTACTTGTTGAGCAGACGGCGTTGTTGCGTCCGCG-3′), S37E Forward (5′-CGCGGACGCAACAACGAAGTCTGCTCAACAAGTAG-3′), and S37E Reverse (5′-CTACTTGTTGAGCAGACTTCGTTGTTGCGTCCGCG-3′). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—PCR products were cloned into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) for prokaryotic expression of His6-tagged GTPCH by standard methods. Plasmid DNA was purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), and sequence confirmation analysis was performed by the Auburn University Genomics and Sequencing Laboratory. The verified DNA was used to transform competent M15 cells harboring the kanamycin-resistant pREP4 plasmid, which provides an inhibitor to expression. Transformed cells were grown on LB plates containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and kanamycin (25 mg/liter). A single colony was picked and grown in 1 liter of LB media containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and kanamycin (25 mg/liter). When bacterial density reached 0.6 at A600, 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (LabScientific, Inc.) was added to induce recombinant protein expression. After 5 h at 37 °C,the bacterial culture medium was centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was stored at -80 °C until use. The cell pellet was thawed for 20 min on ice and resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and one tablet of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) were added, and the mixture was stirred on ice for 30 min. Bacteria were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The clarified supernatant was combined with 1 ml of 50% slurry of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and mixed gently for 60 min at 4 °C. The mixture was applied to a Poly-Prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad). After washing with 20 ml of washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), the protein was eluted with 500 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 200 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The eluate was passed through the column two additional times to increase yield. Protein preparations were analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue protein staining. All kinetic assays were performed on purified recombinant enzymes. Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford protein microassay (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using the Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin used as the standard. Protein Sequence Analysis—Sequence alignments were performed using the MUSCLE alignment program with JalView Java Alignment Editor (41Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (31027) Google Scholar, 42Clamp M. Cuff J. Searle S.M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 12: 426-427Crossref Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Alignment colors pertain to the BLOSUM62 score matrix (43Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). 32P-Phosphorylation Labeling—Ten micrograms of protein was suspended in 50 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), with or without 1.25 kilounit of recombinant mouse catalytic subunit PKA (pH 7.5, Calbiochem) or 10 ng of recombinant rat brain catalytic subunit PKC (pH 8.0, Calbiochem) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. GTPCH phosphorylation reactions were stopped by adding protein loading buffer and boiling for 10 min. Proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried in a slab gel dryer (SGD 4050, Savant). X-ray film was placed on the dried gel, exposed, and developed following standard methods. Kinetic Microplate Assay for GTPCH Activity—Formation of H2NTP from GTP (Roche Applied Science) was monitored using a kinetic microplate assay for GTPCH activity (27Kolinsky M.A. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40677-40682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 44Kolinsky M.A. Gross S.S. Blau N. Thöny B. Pterins, Folates and Neurotransmitters in Molecular Medicine. SPS Publications, Heilbronn, Germany2004: 22-27Google Scholar). An increase in A340 at 15-s intervals over a 1-h period at 37 °C was used to measure the accumulation of H2NTP using a Thermomax microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). All reaction mixtures were 200 μl (final volume) and contained 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer (93.5 mm Na2HPO4, 6.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.8) or 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5), 0.05 μm GTPCH, and various concentrations of GTP and DAHP. A standard curve was generated by complete enzymatic conversion of desired concentrations of GTP to H2NTP by 0.2 μm GTPCH isoform C as described (27Kolinsky M.A. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40677-40682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 44Kolinsky M.A. Gross S.S. Blau N. Thöny B. Pterins, Folates and Neurotransmitters in Molecular Medicine. SPS Publications, Heilbronn, Germany2004: 22-27Google Scholar). HPLC-based Assay for GTPCH Activity—GTPCH activity was assayed by a modification of a method described previously (45Viveros O.H. Lee C.L. Abou-Donia M.M. Nixon J.C. Nichol C.A. Science. 1981; 213: 349-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All reaction mixtures were 70 μl (final volume) and contained 0.2 μm purified GTPCH, 0.25 mm GTP (Roche Applied Science), and various concentrations of BH4, in either 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer or 50 mm Tris buffer. Reactions were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped, and the product, H2NTP, was oxidized to neopterin triphosphate by adding 30 μlof1%I2/2% KI solution in 1 m HCl and incubating at 37 °C for 60 min in the dark. Samples were decolorized with 15 μl of 3% ascorbic acid and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The samples were neutralized with 25 μlof1 m NaOH and dephosphorylated at 37 °C for 30 min in a 70-μl mixture consisting of 50 μl of the oxidized neopterin triphosphate mixture, 2 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science), 7 μlof10× dephosphorylation buffer (Roche Applied Science), 3 μl of 1 m NaOH, and 8 μl of H2O. Neopterin was then quantified by reverse-phase HPLC following centrifugation through micro-spin centrifuge filter tubes (Alltech) with 0.2-μm pore size. Chromatographic separations were performed on an ESA CoulArray (Model 5600A) HPLC instrument. The mobile phase contained 75 mm sodium phosphate adjusted to pH 3.0 with phosphoric acid, 0.75 mm octanesulfonic acid, 25 μm EDTA, 100 μl/liter triethylamine, and 7% acetonitrile. Separations were performed on a Phenomenex Synergi 4-μm Hydro-RP (4.6 × 15 cm) column, preconditioned with 500 ml of buffer before use and run with an isocratic flow at 0.5 ml/min. Neopterin was detected by fluorescence at excitation 360 nm/emission 465 nm with a Linear Model LC305 fluorescence detector. Neopterin content was determined by comparison with commercial neopterin (Sigma) as standard using ESA CoulArray software. PKA Treatment and GTPCH Activity Analysis—Recombinant GTPCH isoforms B and C were expressed and lysed as above. A 45% ammonium sulfate precipitation was performed by dropwise addition of saturated ammonium sulfate solution to the cleared cellular lysate. Following incubation on ice for 1 h, the mixture was centrifuged 10,000 × g for 15 min. The protein pellet, containing GTPCH, was resuspended in 4.5 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, pH 7.5). Treatment or control samples of the resulting mixture (2 ml) were treated with either 5 kilounits of recombinant mouse catalytic subunit PKA (Calbiochem) or equal volume kinase buffer, respectively. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. A 50% slurry of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (500 μl, Qiagen) was added to each sample, and purification of GTPCH was performed as above, except that the protein was eluted with 200 μl of buffer. Proteins (0.05 μm) were assayed in 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer for enzymatic activity using the kinetic microplate assay. DAHP Administration—Newly eclosed, male w1118 flies were collected and aged 72 h on standard media and then maintained on 5% sucrose, 5% Me2SO, with or without 10 or 50 mm DAHP for 72 h. Two DAHP-treatment groups were subsequently maintained on standard media for either 72 or 144 h post treatment. For each treatment, 45-85 flies were frozen and homogenized in 70 μl of 0.1 m perchloric acid. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was filtered through 0.2-μm filters. HPLC analysis was conducted as for the GTPCH activity assay above, with the exception that 1 ml/min isocratic flow was used for the separations, and BH4 was detected electrochemically using an analytical cell ESA Model 5011. Commercial BH4 (Sigma) was used as a standard. Kinetic and Statistical Analyses—SOFTmax Pro (Molecular Devices) and GraphPad Prism computer software were used for determination of kinetic properties and statistical analyses. Kinetic Analysis of Recombinant Drosophila GTPCH Isoforms—To investigate the kinetic properties of Drosophila GTPCH isoforms A-C, recombinant proteins were purified from an Escherichia coli expression system (supplemental Fig. S2). Purified isoforms A-C consistently exhibit higher molecular masses on SDS-PAGE (39, 45, and 47 kDa, respectively) than the calculated molecular masses (30, 34, and 36 kDa, respectively) as noted previously for Drosophila (38McLean J.R. Krishnakumar S. O'Donnell J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27191-27197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat (46Hatakeyama K. Inoue Y. Harada T. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1989; 178: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) GTPCH subunits on SDS-PAGE. This discrepancy appears to be due, in part, to the N-terminal extensions of isoforms A-C, which exhibit apparent higher molecular masses (16, 17, and 18 kDa, respectively) than expected (8, 12, and 13 kDa, respectively), whereas the mobility of the common region is consistent with its expected molecular mass at 24 kDa. The recombinant isoforms were assayed for enzymatic activity using a kinetic microplate assay (27Kolinsky M.A. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 302: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), all three Drosophila alternative isoforms exhibit enzymatic activity (Table 1). The reported K0.5 and Vmax values for the three isoforms are consistent with previously published values for purified Drosophila (34Weisberg E.P. O'Donnell J.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2088279810,"The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) is up-regulated in hypertrophy and is often found up-regulated in end-stage heart failure. Studies have shown that the change in its expression contributes to contractile dysfunction. We have previously shown that the 1831-bp Ncx1 H1 (1831Ncx1) promoter directs cardiac-specific expression of the exchanger in both development and in the adult, and is sufficient for the up-regulation of Ncx1 in response to pressure overload. Here, we utilized adenoviral mediated gene transfer and transgenics to identify minimal regions and response elements that mediate Ncx1 expression in the heart. We demonstrate that the proximal 184 bp of the Ncx1 H1 (184Ncx1) promoter is sufficient for expression of reporter genes in adult cardiomyocytes and for the correct spatiotemporal pattern of Ncx1 expression in development but not for up-regulation in response to pressure overload. Mutational analysis revealed that both the -80 CArG and the -50 GATA elements were required for expression in isolated adult cardiomyocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in adult cardiocytes demonstrate that SRF and GATA4 are associated with the proximal region of the endogenous Ncx1 promoter. Transgenic lines were established for the 1831Ncx1 promoter-luciferase containing mutations in the -80 CArG or -50 GATA element. No luciferase activity was detected during development, in the adult, or after pressure overload in any of the -80 CArG transgenic lines. The Ncx1 -50 GATA mutant promoter was sufficient for driving the normal spatiotemporal pattern of Ncx1 expression in development and for up-regulation in response to pressure overload but importantly, expression was no longer cardiac restricted.

The exchanger catalyzes the electrogenic exchange of Ca2+ and Na+ across the plasma membrane in either the Ca2+-influx or Ca2+-efflux mode. The NCX family includes three mammalian exchanger genes (Ncx1, Ncx2, and Ncx3) with very similar functional properties (1Linck B. Qiu Z. He Z. Tong Q. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C415-C423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ncx1 is highly expressed in the heart and there is a rapid up-regulation of Ncx1 in response to pressure overload (2Kent R.L. Rozich J.D.

Therefore, the up-regulation of the exchanger has been proposed to play an important role in altered excitation-contraction coupling and arrhythmogenesis in the context of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. There are multiple tissue-specific variants of Ncx1 resulting from alternative promoter usage (H1, K1, and Br1) and alternative splicing (3Muller J.G. Isomatsu Y. Koushik S.V. O'Quinn M. Xu L.

The H1 promoter directs cardiac-specific expression and contains many of the cis elements that have been demonstrated to be important in both regulation of cardiac expression and induction in response to α-adrenergic stimulation. Our previous study in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes showed that a construct containing only 184 bases of the 5′-flanking region, the H1 exon, and 67 bp of the first intron is not only sufficient for cardiac-directed expression but also for α-adrenergic stimulation of the luciferase reporter gene. The mutational analysis revealed that both the CArG box at -80 and the GATA element at -50 were required for expression in rat neonatal cardiomyocyte but were not required for α-adrenergic induction (9Cheng G.

In contrast to what we found in neonatal cardiomyocytes, the -80 CArG element mediates a part of the α-adrenergic stimulated up-regulation and is required for Ncx1 up-regulation in response to p38 stimulation in isolated adult cardiomyocytes (10Xu L. Kappler C.S. Menick D.R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study we examine regulation of exchanger expression in the adult heart. We first characterized the role that each of the cis elements plays in Ncx1 expression in adult feline cardiomyocytes and demonstrated that both the -80 GATA and -50 CArG were important for expression in adult cardiomyocytes. Both GATA4, which binds to GATA elements, and the serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the CArG box (CC(A/T)6GG), play essential roles in cardiac development and regulating hypertrophic growth in the adult heart. Numerous cardiac-expressed genes in addition to the exchanger are regulated by both GATA4 and SRF including ANF, brain natriuretic peptide, α-myosin heavy chain, and β-myosin heavy chain. SRF has been demonstrated to stimulate the expression of cardiac muscle genes in association with a variety of cofactors including LIM domain proteins (11Chang D.F. Belaguli N.S. Iyer D. Roberts W.B.

GATA4 has been shown to mediate inducible expression of several cardiac genes both in in vitro studies in response to phenylephrine, isoproterenol, and endothelin-1 (15Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M.

The GATA4 and SRF consensus binding regions shown to be important in Ncx1 expression were further characterized utilizing transgenic mouse lines containing reporter genes driven by mutant Ncx1 promoters to determine the role they play in Ncx1 expression in cardiac development and in response to pressure overload in the adult heart. The -50 GATA mutant promoter is still able to drive transgenic expression in both development and in the adult heart and is still capable of being responsive to pressure overload induced up-regulation but the loss of the -50 GATA element results in some non-cardiac-restricted expression of the Ncx1 promoter. The -80 CArG element is critical for transgene expression and response to pressure overload. Lastly, the Ncx1 minimal (184 bp) promoter containing both the -80 CArG and -50 GATA elements is sufficient for driving the normal spatiotemporal pattern of Ncx1 expression in cardiac development but is not sufficient for pressure overload induced up-regulation indicating that at least one additional element is required for hypertrophic regulation of the exchanger. Rat Neonatal and Feline Adult Cardiomyocytes Isolation and Culture—Primary neonatal cardiomyocytes were obtained from 2-4-day-old neonatal rats and cultured by the method described previously (9Cheng G. Hagen T.P. Dawson M.L. Barnes K.V. Menick D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12819-12826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Adult feline cardiomyocytes were isolated via a hanging heart preparation using enzymatic digestion and cultured by the protocols described previously (19Kent R.L. Mann D.L. Urabe Y. Hisano R. Hewett K.W. Loughnane M. Cooper G.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H1717-H1727PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Adenovirus—Adenoviral constructs were made using the AdEasy system (Stratagene). The Ncx1 promoter-luciferase constructs were cloned into the promoterless pAdTrack vector as described (10Xu L. Kappler C.S. Menick D.R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Viruses were plaque purified, amplified, and titers determined by the Gazes Adenoviral Core. Cardiomyocytes were infected on day 1 in culture by adding titered adenovirus to the culture medium at a different multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). After an infection of 8 h the media was changed. When more than one adenoviral construct was used to infect cells, experiments were carried out to ensure there was no competition for infection between the constructs at the multiplicity of infections used. Adult and neonatal cardiomyocytes infected with m.o.i.s of 1 resulted in the infection and gene transfer to greater than 85% of the plated cells based on GFP expression. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Adult cardiomyocytes were stimulated with 10 mm phenylephrine (PE) and/or infected with GATA4 or SRF adenovirus (m.o.i. = 1). Forty-eight hours after infection and/or stimulation, cells were treated with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature with slow rocking. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described in the manufacturer's manual (Upstate) with some modifications. Cells were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The cell pellet was suspended in lysis buffer and incubated in ice for 20 min. The cell lysate was sonicated 10 times for 10 s each and the cell debris spun down. The sample was pre-cleared and the immunoprecipitation antibody added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After immunoprecipitation, the eluted protein-DNA complexes were de-cross-linked by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. The DNA was ethanol precipitated and the DNA was suspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris buffer. The feline Ncx1 proximal promoter was PCR amplified from the immunoprecipitated and non-immunoprecipitated chromatin using the following primers: sense -152 to -131 (5′-GTGTTGGATGAAGCGGAGAG-3′) and antisense -14 to -34 (5′-AACATGGTTTGCATAGCTGCA-3′). Production of Transgenic Mouse Lines—The Ncx1 promoter-driven luciferase transgenic mice were produced as described previously (3Muller J.G. Isomatsu Y. Koushik S.V. O'Quinn M. Xu L. Kappler C.S. Hapke E. Zile M.R. Conway S.J. Menick D.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 1831-bp full-length feline Ncx1 promoter construct or its mutants (-50 GATA and -80 CarG) were introduced into the multiple cloning site of the luciferase reporter vector pGL2 (Promega, Madison, WI). The 184Ncx1 promoter construct contained the first 184 bases of the feline promoter, the H1 exon, and 67 bases of the first intron fused to the β-galactosidase reporter gene. The resulting constructs were digested, and gel-purified. Pronuclear microinjection in the FVB/N mouse strain was performed at the Transgenic Core Facility of the Medical University of South Carolina. Founder mice were identified by PCR and confirmed by genomic Southern blots. Multitransgenic lines for each construct were maintained by mating transgenic offspring with normal FVB/N mice from Taconic Labs (Germantown, NY). Histological Analysis—Embryo dissection, tissue isolation, fixation, and processing for lacZ staining (n = 23) were carried out as described (20Koushik S.V. Wang J. Rogers R. Moskophidis D. Lambert N.A. Creazzo T.L. Conway S.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1209-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Similarly, all lacZ stained embryonic, newborn and adult samples were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 6 μm thickness for hematoxylin and eosin staining and microscopic analysis according to standard procedures (20Koushik S.V. Wang J. Rogers R. Moskophidis D. Lambert N.A. Creazzo T.L. Conway S.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1209-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization was carried out as described (3Muller J.G. Isomatsu Y. Koushik S.V. O'Quinn M. Xu L. Kappler C.S. Hapke E. Zile M.R. Conway S.J. Menick D.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Pressure Overload Mouse Model—Left ventricular pressure overload was created by microsurgical transverse aortic constriction (TAC) as described previously (3Muller J.G. Isomatsu Y. Koushik S.V. O'Quinn M. Xu L. Kappler C.S. Hapke E. Zile M.R. Conway S.J. Menick D.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, transgenic FVB/N mice carrying the Ncx1H1-luc construct or mutants were anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (2.5 mg/kg) and respiration was artificially controlled. The transverse aorta was constricted by tying a suture around the vessel over a 28-gauge or a 30-gauge blunted needle causing complete occlusion of the aorta. The needle was withdrawn, resulting in a severely stenotic aortic lumen. Two and 7 days after surgery, animals were sacrificed by removal of the heart in deep anesthesia. Echocardiography and Doppler echocardiography were performed on mice before banding (baseline echo) and just prior to sacrifice (final echo). A 15-MHz transducer (Sonos 5500, Agilent Technologies, Andover, MA) was placed on a layer of acoustic coupling gel applied to the hemithorax. Measurements of LV dimension and posterior wall thickness were made at end systole and end diastole according to the leading edge convention of the American Society of Echocardiography. Three to six beats were averaged for each measurement. Fractional shortening and LV mass were calculated as we have described previously (21Roten L. Nemoto S. Simsic J. Coker M.L. Rao V. Baicu S. Defreyte G. Soloway P.J. Zile M.R. Spinale F.G. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 109-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) with standard equations. Standard Doppler techniques were used to measure the velocity (V) across the transverse aortic constriction. Maximum peak pressure gradient was then calculated using a modified Bernoulli equation as 4V2. Left and right ventricular weights were determined after microdissection and tissue samples of the heart and other organs were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The mouse body weight (BW) at the end of the study was used for indexing purposes. All animal experimentation was performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health Guidelines, and protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Medical University of South Carolina. Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Activity and GFP Assays—To quantitate Ncx1-promoter reporter gene expression, samples of heart tissue were ground in a mortar under liquid nitrogen and assayed for luciferase activity as previously described (3Muller J.G. Isomatsu Y. Koushik S.V. O'Quinn M. Xu L. Kappler C.S. Hapke E. Zile M.R. Conway S.J. Menick D.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-Light and Galacto-Light Plus Systems (AB Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity and GFP fluorescence from adenoviral infected neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes were assayed as described (10Xu L. Kappler C.S. Menick D.R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—Multiple comparisons of experimental groups were done with factorial analysis of variance and the Scheffe F post hoc test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. All data are shown as mean ± S.E. The 184Ncx1 Minimal Promoter Is Sufficient for Expression in Adult Cardiomyocytes but Not for Up-regulation—Fig. 1 demonstrates that the Ncx1 minimal promoter is sufficient to direct expression of the luciferase reporter gene in both neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes. The 184Ncx1 promoter drives reporter gene expression at levels 3-4-fold greater than the full-length Ncx1 (1831Ncx1) promoter in both neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1, A and B) because of the deletion of putative repressor elements distal to the minimal 184-bp promoter construct. 5L. Xu and D. R. Menick, unpublished data. The 1831Ncx1 promoter is up-regulated in response to α-adrenergic stimulation in both adult and neonatal cardiomyocytes. However, the 184Ncx1 promoter is up-regulated in response to α-adrenergic stimulation in neonatal cardiomyocytes but is recalcitrant to α-adrenergic stimulation in adult cardiomyocytes (compare Fig. 1, A to B). These data demonstrate that α-adrenergic-stimulated up-regulation of Ncx1 is different in the neonatal cardiomyocyte when compared with the adult cell. To test whether the Ncx1 minimal promoter contains sufficient DNA regulatory elements to direct cardiac-specific expression, we established two independent 184Ncx1-β-galactosidase transgenic mouse lines. Moderate levels of β-galactosidase were detected in the hearts, and only the hearts, of both lines expressing the transgene. The 184Ncx1-driven β-galactosidase expression was initially weakly detectable in E8.5 embryos (not shown) and robustly detected in E9.5 (Fig. 2A) embryos. Significantly, heart-restricted lacZ expression was present in 100% of the transgenic embryos (n = 14) and was absent from all the non-transgenic embryos examined (n = 31). When compared with the endogenous Ncx1 mRNA and Ncx1lacZ knock-in reporter expression patterns (20Koushik S.V. Wang J. Rogers R. Moskophidis D. Lambert N.A. Creazzo T.L. Conway S.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1209-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 22Koushik S.V. Bundy J. Conway S.J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 88: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the lacZ spatiotemporal patterns were very similar (Fig. 2B). Histological sectioning revealed that both 184Ncx1 and Ncx1lacZ lacZ expression was restricted to the cardiomyocytes and absent from the adjacent endothelial and endocardial cushion cells (not shown). However, when older E14 (not shown) and newborn (Fig. 2, C and D) hearts were examined, a less prevalent and “patchy” lacZ expression was detected within subpopulations of the cardiomyocytes within the ventricles and atria of both transgenic lines, when compared with the endogenous Ncx1 mRNA (23Conway S.J. Kruzynska-Frejtag A. Wang J. Rogers R. Kneer P.L. Chen H. Creazzo T. Menick D.R. Koushik S.V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and Ncx1lacZ knock-in reporter expression patterns (20Koushik S.V. Wang J. Rogers R. Moskophidis D. Lambert N.A. Creazzo T.L. Conway S.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1209-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The decreased prevalence and mosaic pattern of expression observed at E14.5 (not shown) and newborn stages persisted into the adult (data not shown). Additionally in these later stages, lacZ reporter activity could be detected in the sinus venosus, pulmonary and caval vein region (Fig. 2D). Importantly, no β-galactosidase activity was detected in the kidney, liver, spleen, brain, or skeletal muscle of the embryonic, newborn, or adult transgenic animals (Table 1). These data reveal that the 184Ncx1 minimal promoter retains the necessary enhancer elements to drive initial early cardiomyocyte-specific reporter expression, but that subsequently undefined enhancer elements required for ubiquitous cardiomyocyte lacZ reporter activity have been deleted.TABLE 1Tissue distribution of luciferase activity in adult 1831Ncx1, 1831Ncx1 GATA -50 mutant and 1831Ncx1 CArG -80 mutant, and β-galactosidase activity in 184Ncx1 transgenic miceLuciferase activityTissue1831Ncx1Ncx1 –50 GATANcx1 –80 CArGβ-Galactosidase activity,aAll values shown are for the luciferase of β-galactosidase activity of the transgenic mouse tissue minus background value of same tissue in non-transgenic mouse 184Ncx1RLUbRLU, relative light unitsRLULeft ventricle37,96420036.71899Brain0000Kidney017.13.90Lung09.500Liver0000Spleen0000Skeletal muscle037.56.20Uterus06000Aorta015.200a All values shown are for the luciferase of β-galactosidase activity of the transgenic mouse tissue minus background value of same tissue in non-transgenic mouseb RLU, relative light units Open table in a new tab Ncx1 transcript and protein levels are increased in response to pressure overload in the feline model of hypertrophy (2Kent R.L.

Physiol. 1993; 265: H1024-H1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and this up-regulation is mediated by the Ncx1 H1 promoter (3Muller J.G. Isomatsu Y. Koushik S.V. O'Quinn M. Xu L. Kappler C.S. Hapke E. Zile M.R. Conway S.J. Menick D.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether the minimal Ncx1 promoter is sufficient for the up-regulation of the exchanger in response to pressure overload hypertrophy, transgenic mice expressing either the 184Ncx1-β-galactosidase, or the wild-type 1831Ncx1-luciferase were subjected to cardiac LV pressure overload by microsurgical TAC. Sham-operated littermates underwent the same anesthesia and thoracotomy protocol without TAC to control for the effect of anesthesia and surgical trauma. The mice from both sham-operated and TAC groups from each transgenic line were euthanized 2 and 7 days after surgery. TAC with either the 28- or 30-gauge needles resulted in a pressure gradient greater than 90 mm Hg. However, 7 days after TAC, LV/BW increased by 31% using a 28-gauge needle and increased by 81% using a 30-gauge needle (Fig. 3, A and B). Protein extracts were prepared from LV tissue samples from control, sham-operated, and TAC-operated transgenic mice to quantify the response of the wild-type and mutant Ncx1-promoter reporter transgene. Reporter gene activity was assayed and normalized for protein content. In the 1831Ncx1 mice, the 28-gauge was sufficient to induce a significant hypertrophic stimulus and increase in luciferase activity. As previously reported (3Muller J.G. Isomatsu Y. Koushik S.V. O'Quinn M. Xu L. Kappler C.S. Hapke E. Zile M.R. Conway S.J. Menick D.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), endogenous Ncx1 protein levels are up-regulated after 7 days of pressure overload (not shown) and the wild-type full-length 1831Ncx1 promoter driven reporter gene activity showed a 2-fold up-regulation after 7 days of pressure overload (Fig. 3C). Preliminary studies in the 184Ncx1 mice did not produce an increase in β-galactosidase reporter activity. To be certain that this was not a false negative response (i.e. insufficient hypertrophic stimulus), we used a 30-gauge needle for TAC in the 184Ncx1 mice. Despite the robust increase in LV mass (81% increase in LV/BW) after 7 days of TAC, there was no up-regulation of the 184Ncx1-β-galactosidase activity when compared with controls after 7 days of TAC (Fig. 3D). Clearly one or more cis elements responsible for Ncx1 up-regulation are distal to the minimal 184-bp promoter construct. Role of -50 GATA and -80 CArG Elements in the Regulation of Ncx1—The NCX1 minimal promoter contains several consensus sequences for a number of potential DNA binding factors that have been shown to be important in regulating NCX1 expression in neonatal cardiomyocytes and have also been shown to be important in regulating the cardiac expression of ANF, brain natriuretic peptide, β-myosin heavy chain, and skeletal α-actin (24Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These include two GATA elements, two E-Box elements, a CArG element, and a binding site for Nkx 2.5 (Fig. 4). It is important to note that the first 184 bp of the human (25Kraev A. Chumakov I. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and feline (8Barnes K.V. Cheng G. Dawson M.M. Menick D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11510-11517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) Ncx1 H1 promoters have 97% identity and the rat (26Scheller T. Kraev A. Skinner S. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7643-7649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and feline sequences have 92% identity. Using the 1831Ncx1 construct, we introduced site-specific point mutations into each of these elements, and the activity in adult cardiomyocytes of each of these adenoviral constructs was compared with the wild-type construct to determine its contribution to expression. Ablation of the -172 E-Box, -153 E-Box, -10 NKE, and the novel element at +103 resulted in >50% of the reporter activity seen in the wild-type promoter-luciferase construct (Fig. 5A). Mutation of the -123 GATA or -50 GATA element resulted in 35 and 29% of wild-type promoter activity, respectively. A point mutation disrupting the -80 CArG element resulted in luciferase activity of less than 20% of the control level. Clearly the CArG and GATA elements are important to basal Ncx1 expression in adult cardiomyocytes.FIGURE 5Effect of Ncx1 promoter transcriptional element mutations on basal and adrenergic stimulation of NCX1 promoter-driven reporter gene expression in adult feline cardiomyocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1969737792,"The crystal structure of the neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) NADPH/FAD binding domain indicated that Ser-1176 is within hydrogen bonding distance of Asp-1393 and the O4 atom of FAD and is also near the N5 atom of FAD (3.7A). This serine residue is conserved in most of the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family of proteins and is important in electron transfer. In the present study, the homologous serines of both nNOS (Ser-1176) and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) (Ser-942) were mutated to threonine and alanine. Both substitutions yielded proteins that exhibited decreased rates of electron transfer through the flavin domains, in the presence and absence of Ca2+/CaM, as measured by reduction of potassium ferricyanide and cytochrome c. Rapid kinetics measurements of flavin reduction of all the mutants also showed a decrease in the rate of flavin reduction, in the absence and presence of Ca2+/CaM, as compared with the wild type proteins. The serine to alanine substitution caused both nNOS and eNOS to synthesize NO more slowly; however, the threonine mutants gave equal or slightly higher rates of NO production compared with the wild type enzymes. The midpoint redox potential measurements of all the redox centers revealed that wild type and threonine mutants of both nNOS and eNOS are very similar. However, the redox potentials of the FMN/FMNH· couple for alanine substitutions of both nNOS and eNOS are >100 mV higher than those of wild type proteins and are positive. These data presented here suggest that hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine with the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and with the amino acids in its immediate milieu, particularly nNOS Asp-1393, affects the redox potentials of various flavin states, influencing the rate of electron transfer."

https://openalex.org/W2048435154,"Oncogenic Ras triggers a permanent cell-cycle arrest known as oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) that constitutes a relevant tumor suppressor mechanism. Ris1 (Ras-induced senescence-1) is a novel gene that was identified in a screen as specifically upregulated during Ras-induced senescence, and that is located at a chromosomal region, 3p21.3, frequently lost in human cancer. Moreover, Ris1 is highly conserved in vertebrates, does not present paralogs, and its sequence does not reveal similarities with other proteins or domains. To analyse the physiological function of Ris1 and test its putative role as a tumor suppressor gene, we have generated mutant mice deficient for this gene. Ris1-null mice are viable, fertile, develop normally and do not display any obvious abnormalities. Of relevance, Ris1-deficient mice had a normal lifespan and did not exhibit predisposition to spontaneous tumors or to tumors induced by chemical carcinogens. Finally, Ris1-deficient embryonic fibroblasts were indistinguishable from wild-type cells regarding their proliferation properties, immortalization, senescence and oncogenic transformation. These findings do not support a role of Ris1 in tumor suppression or in OIS."
