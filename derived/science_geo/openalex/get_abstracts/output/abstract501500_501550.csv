https://openalex.org/W2046999866,"High-frequency ripple oscillations, observed most prominently in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer, are associated with memory consolidation. The cellular and network mechanisms underlying the generation, frequency control, and spatial coherence of the rhythm are poorly understood. Using multisite optogenetic manipulations in freely behaving rodents, we found that depolarization of a small group of nearby pyramidal cells was sufficient to induce high-frequency oscillations, whereas closed-loop silencing of pyramidal cells or activation of parvalbumin- (PV) or somatostatin-immunoreactive interneurons aborted spontaneously occurring ripples. Focal pharmacological blockade of GABAA receptors abolished ripples. Localized PV interneuron activation paced ensemble spiking, and simultaneous induction of high-frequency oscillations at multiple locations resulted in a temporally coherent pattern mediated by phase-locked interneuron spiking. These results constrain competing models of ripple generation and indicate that temporally precise local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons support ripple generation in the intact hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2150951291,"Sensory processing is dependent upon behavioral state. In mice, locomotion is accompanied by changes in cortical state and enhanced visual responses. Although recent studies have begun to elucidate intrinsic cortical mechanisms underlying this effect, the neural circuits that initially couple locomotion to cortical processing are unknown. The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) has been shown to be capable of initiating running and is associated with the ascending reticular activating system. Here, we find that optogenetic stimulation of the MLR in awake, head-fixed mice can induce both locomotion and increases in the gain of cortical responses. MLR stimulation below the threshold for overt movement similarly changed cortical processing, revealing that MLR's effects on cortex are dissociable from locomotion. Likewise, stimulation of MLR projections to the basal forebrain also enhanced cortical responses, suggesting a pathway linking the MLR to cortex. These studies demonstrate that the MLR regulates cortical state in parallel with locomotion."

Why this occurs, however, is unknown. We demonstrate that 24-month-old mice exhibit an impairment of functional recovery after nerve injury compared to 2-month-old animals. We find no difference in the intrinsic growth capacity between aged and young sensory neurons in vitro or in their ability to activate growth-associated transcriptional programs after injury. Instead, using age-mismatched nerve transplants in vivo, we show that the extent of functional recovery depends on the age of the nerve graft, and not the age of the host. Molecular interrogation of the sciatic nerve reveals that aged Schwann cells (SCs) fail to rapidly activate a transcriptional repair program after injury. Functionally, aged SCs exhibit impaired dedifferentiation, myelin clearance, and macrophage recruitment. These results suggest that the age-associated decline in axonal regeneration results from diminished Schwann cell plasticity, leading to slower myelin clearance.

These results suggest that the age-associated decline in axonal regeneration results from diminished Schwann cell plasticity, leading to slower myelin clearance. Successful regeneration of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) requires the coordinated activity of several distinct yet interlocking systems. After axonal injury, neurons activate transcriptional “intrinsic growth” programs and begin extending new axons. Schwann cells (SCs) in the distal nerve undergo a rapid reprogramming process, dedifferentiating into nonmyelinating repair cells that secrete proregenerative factors, clear nonpermissive myelin, recruit macrophages, and create physical tracks onto which newly growing axons can navigate. Macrophages, in turn, enter the site of nerve injury from the circulation and help to complete clearance of myelin and axonal-derived debris, obstacles to regrowth. Remarkably, these complex intrinsic and extrinsic processes can lead to some restoration of function after peripheral nerve trauma. As with most mammalian tissues, however, the regenerative capacity of the PNS declines with advancing age (Nagano, 1998Nagano A. Treatment of brachial plexus injury.J. Orthop.

In humans, an association between age and functional recovery has been pondered since at least World War II, and more recent clinical data quantify this correlation, such as after brachial plexus injury or median nerve transection (Woodhall, 1956Woodhall B. Peripheral Nerve Regeneration: A Follow-up Study of 3,656 World War II Injuries. U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.1956Google Scholar, Nagano, 1998Nagano A.

Sensory relearning after nerve repair.Lancet. 2001; 358: 809-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, broader defects of the aging PNS have also been widely noted. For example, it is estimated that nearly one in three persons over the age of 65 suffers from some form of peripheral neuropathy, and the underlying cause in the majority of these instances is considered idiopathic (Cho et al., 2006Cho D.Y. Mold J.W. Roberts M. Further investigation of the negative association between hypertension and peripheral neuropathy in the elderly: an Oklahoma Physicians Resource/Research Network (OKPRN) study.J. Am. Board Fam. Med. 2006; 19: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding how the PNS changes with normal aging is clinically important. To some degree, the clinical associations between age and the extent of neuronal regeneration have been recapitulated in animal models. While not addressing functional recovery directly, an age-associated impairment of axonal regeneration can be detected in both mice and rats through histological assessments (Verdú et al., 2000Verdú E. Ceballos D. Vilches J.J. Navarro X. Influence of aging on peripheral nerve function and regeneration.J. Peripher. Nerv. Syst. 2000; 5: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). More recently, studies have shown similar phenomena in both zebrafish and the nematode C. elegans (Graciarena et al., 2014Graciarena M. Dambly-Chaudière C. Ghysen A. Dynamics of axonal regeneration in adult and aging zebrafish reveal the promoting effect of a first lesion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 1610-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the developmental decline in axonal regeneration found in the nematode C. elegans is the result of neuronal intrinsic alterations (Zou et al., 2013Zou Y. Chiu H. Zinovyeva A. Ambros V. Chuang C.F. Chang C. Developmental decline in neuronal regeneration by the progressive change of two intrinsic timers.Science. 2013; 340: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the case of mammals, however, to what degree age-associated impairment of axonal regeneration represents neuronal intrinsic alterations versus environmental perturbations remains an open and critical question, with significantly different therapeutic implications. In this study, we used 24- and 2-month-old mice along with standard models of peripheral nerve injury to assess the potential contributions of neurons, immune cells, and peripheral glia to the aging phenotype. Our results demonstrate that extrinsic factors are sufficient to rejuvenate the age-associated decline in mammalian axonal regeneration, and broadly reveal how SC function and its response to axonal injury alters during normal aging, resulting in slower dedifferentiation and myelin clearance. Although previous studies have established in rodents that fewer axons regenerate after injury in aged animals, it is unclear how this might translate into functional recovery, a more meaningful clinical parameter. We thus first sought to establish whether aging impaired functional recovery in mice after nerve injury. To accomplish this, we performed a sciatic nerve crush injury (a model in which full recovery is expected [Ma et al., 2011Ma C.H. Omura T. Cobos E.J. Latrémolière A. Ghasemlou N. Brenner G.J. van Veen E. Barrett L. Sawada T. Gao F. et al.Accelerating axonal growth promotes motor recovery after peripheral nerve injury in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 4332-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar]) on cohorts of 2-, 12-, and 24-month-old C57BL/6 mice, and assayed their sensory and motor functional recovery over time, using behavioral-based assays (see Experimental Procedures). In young mice, full sensory recovery is achieved approximately 15 days after injury, while motor function is restored by day 30, reflecting the short distances and consistent with axon growth of 1–2 mm per day, similar to that found in humans. Aging, however, produces a progressive defect in the onset and time to restoration of motor and sensory function in the mice, with an approximately 3–4 day (∼29%) difference in maximum recovery between young and aged animals for sensory function and a 9–10 day delay (∼44%) for recovery of motor function (Figures 1A and 1B ). Middle-aged animals (12 months) show an intermediate phenotype, indicating that age-dependent slowing of functional recovery is acquired gradually throughout life. Interestingly, the kinetics of these behavioral data suggest that the prominent effect of age is not a slower overall rate of regeneration, but instead a marked delay in the initiation of regeneration in the first place (Figures 1C and 1D). What is responsible for this defect? Because axonal regeneration in mammals is driven by the transcriptional activation of neuronal intrinsic growth programs after injury (Chen et al., 2007Chen Z.L. Yu W.M. Strickland S. Peripheral regeneration.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, Seijffers et al., 2007Seijffers R. Mills C.D. Woolf C.J. ATF3 increases the intrinsic growth state of DRG neurons to enhance peripheral nerve regeneration.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7911-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the age-related decline in regeneration may be the consequence of a diminished intrinsic growth potential of aged neurons (Pestronk et al., 1980Pestronk A. Drachman D.B. Griffin J.W. Effects of aging on nerve sprouting and regeneration.Exp. Neurol. 1980; 70: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, however, we find by transcriptional profiling of young (2-month) and aged (24-month) dorsal root ganglias (DRGs), both before and after nerve injury, extremely comparable gene-expression signatures, with similar levels of injury-induced transcriptional activation between young and old ages (Figures 2A, 2B , and S1A available online). After nerve injury, over 250 genes in the DRG are up- or downregulated greater than 2-fold compared to naive controls (Figure S1B). Among these, only 14 are differentially expressed (>2-fold) between young and aged animals. Many of these age-variant transcripts are also deregulated in naive (uninjured) conditions, implying they are part of a “background” aging signature and not specific to nerve injury (Table S1). Important “regeneration-associated genes” such as ATF3, GAP43, and Sprr1a were not differentially expressed between young and aged DRGs (Figure 2B) (Bonilla et al., 2002Bonilla I.E. Tanabe K. Strittmatter S.M. Small proline-rich repeat protein 1A is expressed by axotomized neurons and promotes axonal outgrowth.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1303-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Chong et al., 1994Chong M.S. Reynolds M.L. Irwin N. Coggeshall R.E. Emson P.C. Benowitz L.I. Woolf C.J.

ATF3 increases the intrinsic growth state of DRG neurons to enhance peripheral nerve regeneration.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7911-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As predicted from the transcriptional data, in vitro neurite outgrowth assays using dissociated neurons revealed comparable growth activity regardless of age, in both naive and preconditioned DRG sensory neurons, confirming no deficit with age in the degree of intrinsic neuronal growth induced by injury (Figures 2C–2G). These experiments strongly argue that a mechanism extrinsic to neurons moderates the regenerative potential of aging DRG neurons in vivo. As such, we hypothesized that allowing “aged” axons to regenerate into a “youthful” environment might enhance functional recovery in aged animals. Conversely, we conjectured that forcing young axons to regenerate into an “aged” environment would result in impaired recovery. To test this, we harvested 1 cm segments of sciatic nerve from either aged or young animals and directly sutured them onto the two cut ends of transected sciatic nerves of either old or young animals. In this way, axons from the host animal must regenerate through a 1 cm segment of either age-matched or age-mismatched nerve tissue before reaching the distal end of the nerve en route to their targets in the skin (Figure 3A). We assessed sensory functional recovery to monitor regeneration. Because transection/resuture injuries are more severe than crush injuries, motor recovery of plantar muscles in the foot is not obtained, and functional sensory recovery takes much longer (Ma et al., 2011Ma C.H. Omura T. Cobos E.J. Latrémolière A. Ghasemlou N. Brenner G.J. van Veen E. Barrett L. Sawada T. Gao F. et al.Accelerating axonal growth promotes motor recovery after peripheral nerve injury in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 4332-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we observed that functional recovery was enhanced in aged animals receiving young nerve grafts such that it now resembled that found in young animals receiving young nerve grafts (Figure 3B). Reciprocally, young animals receiving aged nerve grafts showed slower functional recovery, similar to aged animals receiving aged nerve grafts (Figure 3B). We further quantified the extent of axonal regeneration in an age-mismatched system. To accomplish this, we used a different nerve graft strategy in which either young or old 1-cm-long pieces of sciatic nerve were sutured onto the proximal cut end nerves of Thy1 YFP+ young host animals (aged transgenic mice were not available for the reciprocal experiment) (Figure 3C). Thy1 YFP+ mice were chosen to enable visualization of regenerating fibers in the graft. After 1 week, the number of YFP+ axons growing into either young or aged donor tissue was quantified histologically. Forcing young axons to regenerate into an aged environment, as opposed to a young one, severely impaired the extent and length of growth, with reduced numbers of axons at every distance from the site of the graft (Figures 3D and 3E). Given the age-dependent ability of factors extrinsic to the injured neurons to modulate axonal growth, we next sought to identify what age-associated changes occur within the sciatic nerve environment. To this end, transcriptional profiling of young and aged nerves distal to a sciatic nerve ligation (to prevent regenerating axons from contaminating samples) revealed widespread age-related alterations (Figures 4A–4C, S2A, and S2B; Tables S2 and S3). From a global perspective, gene pathway analyses of differentially represented transcripts between young and aged nerves showed several significantly enriched pathways, using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) databases (Figures 4A, 4B, S3A, and S3B). In young nerves after injury, this included prominent overrepresentation of genes associated with “cell cycle,” “DNA replication,” and the “extracellular matrix,” while genes associated with the “inflammatory response” were among the pathways relatively enriched in old nerves (Figures 4A and 4B). Several pathways are also enriched in young nerves in naive conditions, such as genes associated with the “extracellular matrix” and “lipid biosynthesis” (Figures S3A and S3B). This analysis suggests that a greater degree of cell proliferation may occur in young than aged nerves distal to an injury. The specific age-associated alterations can be seen prominently by the number of transcripts that deviate from the Y = X parity line in the fold change versus fold change plot, indicating that hundreds of genes up- or downregulated after injury in the young are not equally regulated in aged nerves. Strikingly, we found that many of these genes are associated with a “repair program” in SCs activated after injury (Figure 4C; Table S3). After nerve injury, SCs undergo a phenotypic reprogramming process whereby they downregulate their myelinating phenotype, rapidly divide, and acquire a nonmyelinating “repair cell” phenotype critical for the development of a growth-permissive environment within the nerve that facilitates regeneration (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012Arthur-Farraj P.J. Latouche M. Wilton D.K. Quintes S. Chabrol E. Banerjee A. Woodhoo A. Jenkins B. Rahman M.

Syst. 2008; 13: 122-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We observed a prominent age-related deregulation of genes encoding key repair cell functions. Genes downregulated in aged nerves relative to young ones after injury included those associated with growth factors (BTC, NGFR, BDNF) and mitosis (e.g., KIF2C, PBK, BIRC5, CDC20) (Figure 4C; Table S3). Likewise, genes associated with myelin production (e.g., PMP2, MPZ, MAL, EGR2) were relatively overexpressed in lesioned aged animals, implying an impaired ability to downregulate their myelinating phenotype after injury (Figure 4C). Recently, the transcription factor c-Jun was identified as a “master regulator” of the SC repair phenotype after nerve injury, and SC-specific ablation of c-Jun results in severely impaired functional recovery (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012Arthur-Farraj P.J. Latouche M. Wilton D.K. Quintes S. Chabrol E. Banerjee A. Woodhoo A. Jenkins B. Rahman M. Turmaine M. et al.c-Jun reprograms Schwann cells of injured nerves to generate a repair cell essential for regeneration.Neuron. 2012; 75: 633-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we noticed marked similarities between the transcriptional profiles of injured aged nerves and genes altered in mice lacking c-Jun expression in SCs after injury (e.g., MPZ, CDH1, SEMA4F), suggesting that genes under control of c-Jun were altered in aged animals (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012Arthur-Farraj P.J. Latouche M. Wilton D.K. Quintes S. Chabrol E. Banerjee A. Woodhoo A. Jenkins B. Rahman M. Turmaine M. et al.c-Jun reprograms Schwann cells of injured nerves to generate a repair cell essential for regeneration.Neuron. 2012; 75: 633-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Strikingly, western blot analysis demonstrated that the regulation of c-Jun protein was significantly different in the nerves of aged compared with young animals immediately after injury (Figures 4D and 4E). The initial burst of c-Jun expression found in the nerves of young animals 1 day after injury was approximately 5-fold higher than that in aged animals (Figure 4E). ERK and JNK, two upstream kinase pathways of c-Jun, were unaltered in aged sciatic nerves after injury (Figure S4). If, as suggested by these data, SC dedifferentiation and repair cell functions are impaired with aging, one would predict functional consequences in the SCs, and more generally, for Wallerian degeneration in the nerve. To test this, we first performed toluidine blue staining and electron microscopy examination of distal sections of young and aged sciatic nerves. These revealed stark differences in Wallerian degeneration. By 3 days after a nerve crush injury in young mice, axons in the nerve distal to the injury have degenerated and been cleared, and the myelin sheaths surrounding the axons have also degenerated, leaving the nerve landscape largely empty of any organized structure (Figures 5A and 5C ). In complete contrast, however, axons in the distal nerve of aged animals are at a less developed state of degeneration and clearance, and more starkly, most myelin sheaths remain intact (Figures 5B and 5D). Quantification of axons with intact myelin sheaths shows approximately four times the number remaining in aged, as opposed to young, animals (Figure 5E). These data are consistent with previous histological studies in rodents, and quantify the aberrant delayed state of early Wallerian degeneration in aged animals (Vaughan, 1992Vaughan D.W. Effects of advancing age on peripheral nerve regeneration.J. Comp. Neurol. 1992; 323: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Verdú et al., 2000Verdú E. Ceballos D. Vilches J.J. Navarro X. Influence of aging on peripheral nerve function and regeneration.J. Peripher. Nerv. Syst. 2000; 5: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). We next directly addressed if age affected SC function and repair responses after nerve injury. As expected, expression of p75, an induced marker for the repair cell phenotype, was delayed in aged SCs after sciatic nerve crush injury compared to young controls. In young animals, ∼65% of S100+ SCs were positive for p75 3 days after nerve injury (Figures 6A, 7A, and 7B ). S100 is an SC marker constitutively present in intact and dedifferentiated SCs. In aged animals, however, p75 reactivity was observed in only ∼16% of S100+ SCs.Figure 7Functional Defects in Aged Schwann CellsShow full caption(A–C) Cross-sections and whole mounts of sciatic nerves from young and aged animals at days 0, 3, 5, and 7 after nerve crush injury stained with (A) S100 and p75, (B) CD68, and (C) MBP.(D–F) Quantification of staining from (A)–(C).

For example, macrophage recruitment into the degenerating nerve depends upon factors secreted by dedifferentiated SCs (Napoli et al., 2012Napoli I. Noon L.A. Ribeiro S. Kerai A.P. Parrinello S. Rosenberg L.H. Collins M.J. Harrisingh M.C. White I.J. Woodhoo A. Lloyd A.C. A central role for the ERK-signaling pathway in controlling Schwann cell plasticity and peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo.Neuron. 2012; 73: 729-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We thus measured macrophage recruitment into the degenerating nerve by tracking the expression of CD68, a standard marker for activated macrophages, over time. This revealed a markedly delayed recruitment of CD68+ macrophages after injury in aged animals of up to 7 days (Figures 7C and 7D). This delay in immune cell recruitment is unlikely to be the result of a defect intrinsic to aged immune cells because heterochronic parabiosis, which provides aged animals with access to young hematopoietic cells, failed to rescue the aging phenotype (Figures S5A–S5F). This model successfully enhances remyelination in the CNS in a macrophage-dependent manner (Ruckh et al., 2012Ruckh J.M. Zhao J.W. Shadrach J.L. van Wijngaarden P. Rao T.N. Wagers A.J. Franklin R.J. Rejuvenation of regeneration in the aging central nervous system.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 96-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and immune cell chimerism was detected in both the spleens and sciatic nerves of conjoined animals after nerve injury (Figures S5B–S5D). Another critical downstream function of SCs after injury is the physical fragmentation of their myelin sheaths followed by intracellular degradation of myelin proteins and lipids. Myelin is an inhibitory substrate for axon growth, and it is thus essential that myelin debris is cleared from the distal injury site before regeneration can occur (McKerracher et al., 1994McKerracher L. David S. Jackson D.L. Kottis V. Dunn R.J. Braun P.E. Identification of myelin-associated glycoprotein as a major myelin-derived inhibitor of neurite growth.Neuron. 1994; 13: 805-811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). SCs from aged mice showed a deficit in their ability to initiate myelin clearance during early time points after injury, in parallel with the delay in expression of p75 (Figures 7E and 7F). Dense MBP-positive myelin accumulations were colocalized within p75-positive (dedifferentiated) SCs soon after injury in young nerves, but not in p75-positive aged SCs (Figures 6A and 6B). The defect can be clearly seen from myelin staining in distal segments of the sciatic nerve after crush injury, where 3 days after injury to young nerves, SCs show large, bright, MBP-positive accumulation of fragmented myelin, indicating that myelin breakdown is underway, while in aged animals most MBP staining is evenly distributed in continuous sheaths, similar to intact nerves (Figures 7E and 7F). The SC-mediated mechanism of intracellular myelin degradation is believed to depend on SC phagocytosis of extracellular myelin debris (Brosius Lutz and Barres, 2014Brosius Lutz A. Barres B.A. Contrasting the glial response to axon injury in the central and peripheral nervous systems.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 7-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To directly address cell-intrinsic SC phagocytosis, we purified populations of SCs from young and aged sciatic nerves and cultured them in the presence of labeled myelin (Figure 7G). Quantification of the amount of myelin contained within SCs using fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed 35% less phagocytosis of myelin in aged versus young SCs (Figure 7H). This defect was not the result of reduced viability of aged SCs (Figure 7I). Thus, aged SCs exhibit a reduced capacity for myelin breakdown and clearance in vitro and in vivo. We have found that aging introduces a progressive decline in the initiation of axonal regeneration after injury in mammals. This age-dependent slowing in regenerative potential may contribute to the suboptimal clinical outcomes reported after nerve trauma in elderly individuals (Nagano, 1998Nagano A. Treatment of brachial plexus injury.J. Orthop. Sci. 1998; 3: 71-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Lundborg and Rosén, 2001Lundborg G. Rosén B. Sensory relearning after nerve repair.Lancet. 2001; 358: 809-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our data also demonstrate that the regenerative capacity of the aging mammalian PNS is not limited by diminished neuronal growth responses, but is instead profoundly influenced by extrinsic factors in the surrounding tissue. We found that neuronal intrinsic growth responses are unaltered with normal aging and that aged neurons can be fully “primed” to regenerate after an axonal injury supported by an undiminished injury-induced transcriptional change. This notion is consistent with recently published data demonstrating that the rate of axonal regeneration does not differ between young and aged mice in vivo (Kang and Lichtman, 2013Kang H. Lichtman J.W. Motor axon regeneration and muscle reinnervation in young adult and aged animals.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 19480-19491Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that the ectopic introduction of aged tissue impeded regeneration in young, healthy mice, whereas grafting of young tissue enabled aged neurons to express a robust repair potential. These observations indicate that deficient axonal regeneration in aged animals arises from a dominant extrinsic inhibition of neuronal outgrowth by the aged microenvironment, and suggest that functional recovery after axotomy may be enhanced throughout life via neuron-extrinsic mechanisms. Our analysis demonstrates that SC injury responses are substantially altered in ag"

Mammalian protoplasmic astrocytes develop a dense ramified meshwork of cellular processes to form intimate contacts with neuronal cell bodies, neurites, and synapses. This close neuron-glia morphological relationship is essential for astrocyte function, but it remains unclear how astrocytes establish their intricate morphology, organize spatial domains, and associate with neurons and synapses in vivo. Here we characterize a Drosophila glial subtype that shows striking morphological and functional similarities to mammalian astrocytes. We demonstrate that the Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor Heartless autonomously controls astrocyte membrane growth, and the FGFs Pyramus and Thisbe direct astrocyte processes to ramify specifically in CNS synaptic regions. We further show that the shape and size of individual astrocytes are dynamically sculpted through inhibitory or competitive astrocyte-astrocyte interactions and Heartless FGF signaling. Our data identify FGF signaling through Heartless as a key regulator of astrocyte morphological elaboration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2042782086,"Objective Lactobacillus dominates the lower genital tract microbiota of many women, producing a low vaginal pH, and is important for healthy pregnancy outcomes and protection against several sexually transmitted pathogens. Yet, factors that promote Lactobacillus remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that the amount of free glycogen in the lumen of the lower genital tract is an important determinant of Lactobacillus colonization and a low vaginal pH. Methods Free glycogen in lavage samples was quantified. Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to identify microbiota from 21 African American women collected over 8–11 years. Results Free glycogen levels varied greatly between women and even in the same woman. Samples with the highest free glycogen had a corresponding median genital pH that was significantly lower (pH 4.4) than those with low glycogen (pH 5.8; p<0.001). The fraction of the microbiota consisting of Lactobacillus was highest in samples with high glycogen versus those with low glycogen (median = 0.97 vs. 0.05, p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, having 1 vs. 0 male sexual partner in the past 6 months was negatively associated, while BMI ≥30 was positively associated with glycogen. High concentrations of glycogen corresponded to higher levels of L. crispatus and L. jensenii, but not L. iners. Conclusion These findings show that free glycogen in genital fluid is associated with a genital microbiota dominated by Lactobacillus, suggesting glycogen is important for maintaining genital health. Treatments aimed at increasing genital free glycogen might impact Lactobacillus colonization."

Here, we show that BG4, a G-quadruplex-specific antibody, can be used to stain DNA G-quadruplex structures in patient-derived tissues using immunohistochemistry. We observe a significantly elevated number of G-quadruplex-positive nuclei in human cancers of the liver and stomach as compared to background non-neoplastic tissue. Our results suggest that G-quadruplex formation can be detected and measured in patient-derived material and that elevated G-quadruplex formation may be a characteristic of some cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2127072069,"Beta-lactamase resistant bacteria and especially ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae are an increasing problem worldwide. For this reason a major interest in efficient and reliable methods for rapid screening of high sample numbers is recognizable. Therefore, a multiplex real-time PCR was developed to detect the predominant class A beta-lactamase genes blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaTEM and CIT-type AmpCs in a one-step reaction. A set of 114 Enterobacteriaceae containing previously identified resistance gene subtypes and in addition 20 undefined animal and environmental isolates were used for the validation of this assay. To confirm the accessibility in variable settings, the real-time runs were performed analogous in two different laboratories using different real-time cyclers. The obtained results showed complete accordance between the real-time data and the predetermined genotypes. Even if sequence analyses are further necessary for a comprehensive characterization, this method was proofed to be reliable for rapid screening of high sample numbers and therefore could be an important tool for e. g. epidemiological purposes or support infection control measures."
https://openalex.org/W2081984751,"The serine hydrolase α/β-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) hydrolyzes the most abundant endocannabinoid (eCB) in the brain, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and controls its availability at cannabinoid receptors. We show that ABHD6 inhibition decreases pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizure incidence and severity. This effect is retained in Cnr1(-/-) or Cnr2(-/-) mice, but blocked by addition of a subconvulsive dose of picrotoxin, suggesting the involvement of GABAA receptors. ABHD6 inhibition also blocked spontaneous seizures in R6/2 mice, a genetic model of juvenile Huntington's disease known to exhibit dysregulated eCB signaling. ABHD6 blockade retained its antiepileptic activity over chronic dosing and was not associated with psychomotor or cognitive effects. While the etiology of seizures in R6/2 mice remains unsolved, involvement of the hippocampus is suggested by interictal epileptic discharges, increased expression of vGLUT1 but not vGAT, and reduced Neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression. We conclude that ABHD6 inhibition may represent a novel antiepileptic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2101397865,"Recent studies in psychophysiology show an increased attention for examining the reliability of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), which are measures of cognitive control (e.g., Go/No-Go tasks). An important index of reliability is the internal consistency (e.g., Cronbach's alpha) of a measure. In this study, we examine the internal consistency of the N2 and P3 in a Go/No-Go task. Furthermore, we attempt to replicate the previously found internal consistency of the Error-Related Negativity (ERN) and Positive-Error (Pe) in an Eriksen Flanker task. Healthy participants performed a Go/No-Go task and an Eriksen Flanker task, whereby the amplitudes of the correct No-Go N2/P3, and error trials for ERN/Pe were the variables of interest. This study provides evidence that the N2 and P3 in a Go/No-Go task are internally consistent after 20 and 14 trials are included in the average, respectively. Moreover, the ERN and Pe become internally consistent after approximately 8 trials are included in the average. In addition guidelines and suggestions for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1988472272,"Amphetamines modify the brain and alter behavior through mechanisms generally attributed to their ability to regulate extracellular dopamine concentrations. However, the actions of amphetamine are also linked to adaptations in glutamatergic signaling. We report here that when amphetamine enters dopamine neurons through the dopamine transporter, it stimulates endocytosis of an excitatory amino acid transporter, EAAT3, in dopamine neurons. Consistent with this decrease in surface EAAT3, amphetamine potentiates excitatory synaptic responses in dopamine neurons. We also show that the process of internalization is dynamin- and Rho-mediated and requires a unique sequence in the cytosolic C terminus of EAAT3. Introduction of a peptide based on this motif into dopamine neurons blocks the effects of amphetamine on EAAT3 internalization and its action on excitatory responses. These data indicate that the internalization of EAAT3 triggered by amphetamine increases glutamatergic signaling and thus contributes to the effects of amphetamine on neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W2009835089,"P2X receptors (P2XRs) are ATP-gated cation channels widely expressed in the brain where they mediate action of extracellular ATP released by neurons or glia. Although purinergic signaling has multiple effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity, P2XR function at brain synapses remains to be established. Here, we show that activation of postsynaptic P2XRs by exogenous ATP or noradrenaline-dependent glial release of endogenous ATP decreases the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and AMPA-evoked currents in cultured hippocampal neurons. We also observed a P2X-mediated depression of field potentials recorded in CA1 region from brain slices. P2X2Rs trigger dynamin-dependent internalization of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), leading to reduced surface AMPARs in dendrites and at synapses. AMPAR alteration required calcium influx through opened ATP-gated channels and phosphatase or CamKII activities. These findings indicate that postsynaptic P2XRs play a critical role in regulating the surface expression of AMPARs and thereby regulate the synaptic strength."
https://openalex.org/W1964891982,"Adolescent brain research has offered an explanation of adolescent behavior relevant for parents, society, and policymakers. As the science continues to evolve, it will advance understanding of adolescent potential and individual variation to further generate developmentally appropriate expectations, policies, and sanctions. Adolescent brain research has offered an explanation of adolescent behavior relevant for parents, society, and policymakers. As the science continues to evolve, it will advance understanding of adolescent potential and individual variation to further generate developmentally appropriate expectations, policies, and sanctions. The explosion of research on the adolescent brain in recent years has triggered enthusiastic attention from the media, policymakers, and legal scholars alike. Initial media portrayals of this research fueled the perception that the developing brain was an enigma to be reckoned with and that it rendered adolescents fragile, troubled, and irrational. Fortunately, scientists have increasingly rectified this perception through empirical research showing that the ontogenetic changes in the adolescent brain are adaptive for the individual and beneficial for society. Nonscientists are now connecting with developmental cognitive neuroscience researchers to enact meaningful voices in shaping social policy and legal sanctions related to adolescents. Although still relatively new compared to the plethora of research on earlier and later stages of development, adolescent brain research has thus far been impactful in at least three ways. First, it has neurobiologically differentiated adolescents from children and adults. Second, it has helped explain adolescent behavior. Third, it demonstrates that the brain is adaptively plastic well beyond the early postnatal years. These advancements have been essential to the mission of generating developmentally appropriate expectations, policies, and sanctions for adolescents. More broadly, the research has generated a fresh perspective on this powerful period of life. At no other time in life is there greater intrinsic motivation to explore new experiences than during adolescence (Crone and Dahl, 2012Crone E.A. Dahl R.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 636-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Youth are often at the forefront of new ideas, impassioned defenders of ideals, fervid leaders, and the ones having the most fun in the quest for autonomy. These characteristics are what make adolescents adolescents—despite better cognitive, intellectual, and reasoning abilities than children, adolescents are not simply “mini-adults” and despite immature emotion regulation, inexperience, and dependence on caregivers, adolescents are not overgrown children. Instead, they are in a distinct developmental stage that facilitates the adaptive transition from a state of dependence on caregivers to one of relative independence. However, along the road to autonomy, the very same characteristics that catalyze independence may lead adolescents to stumble into harmful behaviors—ones that have been the focus of our society’s perception of the teenage years. Historically, lawmakers have tended to binarize age boundaries between “minors,” who are presumed to be vulnerable, dependent, and incompetent to make decisions, and adults, who are viewed as autonomous, responsible, and entitled to exercise legal rights and privileges (Bonnie and Scott, 2013Bonnie R.J. Scott E.S. Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 2013; 22: 158-161Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, neuroscience research conducted over the past two decades has demonstrated that the adolescent brain is anatomically and functionally unique. Using neuroimaging tools, researchers have examined the human brain in vivo to identify adolescent-specific neurobiological changes. Research by Casey et al., 1997Casey B.J. Trainor R.J. Orendi J.L. Schubert A.B. Nystrom L.E. Giedd J.N. Castellanos F.X. Haxby J.V. Noll D.C. Cohen J.D. et al.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar was the first to empirically connect protracted neural development with immature cognitive regulation in humans. The prefrontal cortex, a region important in self-control and rational decision making, is the last brain region to mature, well into the mid-20s and long past the normative developmental trends of other brain regions. This protracted development is paralleled by significant increases in neurocognitive maturation and is functionally meaningful because it places adolescents in the unique neurocognitive position of being more cognitively sophisticated than younger children but not quite as experienced, wise, and mature as adults. Several recent studies have demonstrated that the relatively unstable nature of the prefrontal cortex in adolescents renders it more susceptible to emotional, arousing, or distracting information than in adults (e.g. Somerville et al., 2011Somerville L.H. Hare T. Casey B.J. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2011; 23: 2123-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, Geier et al., 2010Geier C.F. Terwilliger R. Teslovich T. Velanova K. Luna B. Cereb. Cortex. 2010; 20: 1613-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In fact, whereas adolescents and adults perform comparably on cognitive tests and logical reasoning, adolescents are not as equally mature when it comes to capacities such as impulse control, reward sensitivity, and resistance to peer influence (Steinberg, 2013Steinberg L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that the adolescent brain functions differently based on context—in “cold” or unarousing situations, adolescent behavior and brain function is very similar to that of adults, but under “hot” or arousing conditions, adolescent behavior is more impulsive and emotional (Somerville et al., 2011Somerville L.H. Hare T. Casey B.J. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2011; 23: 2123-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, Figner et al., 2009Figner B. Mackinlay R.J. Wilkening F. Weber E.U. J. Exp. Psychol. Learn. Mem. Cogn. 2009; 35: 709-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The application to real life is clear: policies about adolescents need to take into consideration the capricious nature of adolescent behavior. The prefrontal susceptibility to arousing information has previously been described as a “hijacking” of the regulatory system by the affective system (Casey and Caudle, 2013Casey B.J. Caudle K. Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 2013; 22: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). During adolescence, affective neural systems, including the striatum and amygdala, undergo a fluctuating course of development. These systems are most excitable and responsive to the environment during adolescence, rendering adolescents more reward-seeking, risk-sensitive, and emotionally reactive than younger or older individuals (Galván, 2013Galván A. Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 2013; 22: 100-105Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Adolescents exhibit enhanced activation of the ventral striatum in response to rewards, an effect that is linked to increased risky behavior (Galván et al., 2007Galván A. Hare T.A. Voss H. Glover G. Casey B.J. Dev. Sci. 2007; 10: F8-F14Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). This hyperactivation persists through the late adolescent years and into early adulthood (Lamm et al., 2014Lamm C. Benson B.E. Guyer A.E. Perez-Edgar K. Fox N.A. Pine D.S. Ernst M. Brain Cogn. 2014; (Published online January 28, 2014)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bandc.2013.12.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), underscoring the protracted development of the reward system. Using connectivity methods, researchers have recently shown that this developmental trajectory also applies to communication between neural networks: prefrontal regulation of affective regions that is normative in adults has not yet reached equilibrium in adolescents (Somerville et al., 2011Somerville L.H. Hare T. Casey B.J. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2011; 23: 2123-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The brain continues to increase in the efficiency of connections between these systems in adolescence, strengthening pathways that are called upon routinely. In general, maturation of functional connections is driven by the integration of regions that are distal from each other into functional networks by strengthening of long-range functional connections (Dosenbach et al., 2010Dosenbach N.U. Nardos B. Cohen A.L. Fair D.A. Power J.D. Church J.A. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Vogel A.C. Lessov-Schlaggar C.N. et al.Science. 2010; 329: 1358-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). This plasticity helps sculpt each individual’s brain in an experience-dependent manner. The brain is remarkably malleable. In response to new experiences, social interactions, and learning opportunities, the brain reshapes and refines itself adaptively to fit the needs of the individual. This phenomenon is particularly true during periods of rapid development like adolescence. Although plasticity during this window renders the adolescent more vulnerable to negative influence, it also makes adolescence an ideal time to positively influence or redirect problem behaviors. Policymakers are increasingly using developmental neuroscience research to determine how well adolescents will respond to justice-system interventions (Bonnie and Scott, 2013Bonnie R.J. Scott E.S. Curr. Dir. Psychol. Sci. 2013; 22: 158-161Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As such, greater efforts to determine not only which interventions are most effective but when they are most likely to change or influence behavior are necessary; this knowledge can inform targeted interventions to prevent recidivism, encourage prosocial behavior, or spark an interest in a positive activity. Experience-based neural plasticity occurs across the entire lifespan but one unanswered question is whether adolescence is a “sensitive period” for neural development. Do events experienced during this developmental window have a uniquely consequential effect on future outcomes and behavior? In the coming decade, one goal of developmental cognitive neuroscience research will be to resolve this question. Evidence from animal models suggests that experience during the juvenile years is uniquely powerful in shaping brain architecture and behavior (Linkenhoker et al., 2005Linkenhoker B.A. von der Ohe C.G. Knudsen E.I. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) such that habits that are established during adolescence not only sculpt the brain contemporaneously but have long-lasting effects into adulthood. To test this empirically in humans would require large longitudinal studies in which participants who experienced an experimental manipulation at baseline were compared longitudinally to individuals who did not experience the manipulation. This type of experiment is incredibly challenging and expensive to conduct but indirect evidence suggests that adolescence is a sensitive period. First, passionate involvement in new psychosocial or spiritual experiences can generate lifelong behavioral transformations; adolescence has thus been coined a sensitive period for sociocultural processing (Blakemore and Mills, 2014Blakemore S.J. Mills K.L. Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2014; 65: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Second, Falconi et al., 2014Falconi A. Gemmill A. Dahl R.E. Catalano R. J. Dev. Orig. Health Dis. 2014; 5: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar concluded that early adolescence is a sensitive developmental period for males. They applied time series methods to cohort mortality data and found that population stressors experienced during ages 10–14 are more strongly associated with a decrease in lifespan compared with those experienced during infancy, ages 1–9, and ages 15–19 (Falconi et al., 2014Falconi A. Gemmill A. Dahl R.E. Catalano R. J. Dev. Orig. Health Dis. 2014; 5: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Third, recent cross-sectional research from our laboratory demonstrates that the adolescent brain is more susceptible to input than adults. Given the alarming high proportion of adult smokers (80%) who began smoking before age 18, we hypothesized that the adolescent brain may be uniquely susceptible to cigarette cues. Our fMRI study suggests that one reason cigarette ads may be more influential in youth is because they exhibit a greater neural response in reward-related circuitry when presented with smoking cues, an effect that subsequently predicts cigarette craving (K. Do and A.G., unpublished data). Collectively, these strands of evidence indicate that adolescence is indeed a sensitive period and may explain why adolescents are more behaviorally and neurobiologically sensitive to environmental inputs than adults. “Raging hormones” has long been a narrative used to explain the emotional, impulsive, and passionate behavior often observed in adolescents. While hormonal changes that emerge during puberty clearly contribute to these behaviors (Crone and Dahl, 2012Crone E.A. Dahl R.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 636-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar), maturation of frontostriatal circuitry is equally influential. Knowledge of these ontogenetic neural changes has increasingly played a role in remarkable policy and legal decisions related to juveniles. The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on criminal behavior in juveniles (Roper v. Simmons, 2005, 125 S. Ct. 1183; Graham v. Florida, 2010, 130 S. Ct. 2011; Miller v. Alabama, 2012, 132 S. Ct. 2455) is perhaps the most impactful consequence of this research. Neuroscience data have been used to support the position that adolescents are less mature than adults in ways that mitigate their criminal culpability (Steinberg, 2013Steinberg L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In Roper v. Simmons, in which capital punishment was found to be unconstitutional for individuals under the age of 18 years, the Court highlighted behavioral differences between adolescents and adults with little mention of adolescent brain development. However, in more recent cases, including Graham v. Florida, which banned the implementation of life without parole for juveniles who are convicted of crimes other than homicide, and the joined cases of Miller v. Alabama and Jackson v. Hobbs (2012, 132 S. Ct. 1733), in which the Court held that it is unconstitutional for states to mandate life without parole for juveniles, opinions were directly informed by neuroscience research. Three general characteristics of adolescent behavior, all substantiated by neuroscientific evidence, have influenced the Court. First, in several rulings the Court commented on the role of developing regulatory systems in limiting behavioral regulation, the following of which is one such example, “It is increasingly clear that adolescent brains are not yet fully mature in regions and systems related to higher-order executive functions such as impulse control, planning ahead, and risk avoidance” (Miller v. Alabama). Second, the Court has noted that juveniles differ from adults in being “more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure” (Roper v. Simmons). Recent neuroscience research has substantiated this opinion. In a clever experiment in which participants of different ages played a risky computer game in the presence of peers and while undergoing a brain scan, Chein and colleagues (Chein et al., 2011Chein J. Albert D. O’Brien L. Uckert K. Steinberg L. Dev. Sci. 2011; 14: F1-F10Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) demonstrated that adolescents not only take greater risks than adults in the presence of peers but that they exhibit increased activation in reward circuitry. Third, the Court opined that “the character of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult. The personality traits of juveniles are more transitory, less fixed (Roper v. Simmons),” an opinion consonant with the plasticity of the adolescent brain and the likelihood of behavioral changes across development. The recognition that [juveniles show] “heightened capacity for change” (Miller v. Alabama and Jackson v. Hobbs) is particularly important because it has implications for the sanctions imparted on youth convicted of criminal activity. The influence of brain research on the Supreme Court is highly significant but it will, thankfully, only impact a relatively small proportion of youth in the United States. A more wide-reaching influence of this research is on teenage driving regulations. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for U.S. teens (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2012). Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS). http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html.Google Scholar). Per mile driven, teen drivers are three times more likely than drivers aged 20 and older to be in a fatal crash. Fatalities are even higher among adolescent drivers who are male, driving with adolescent passengers, or newly licensed (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2012). Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS). http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html.Google Scholar). Knowledge about the protracted development of the adolescent brain, and in particular, research on the limited cognitive control and hyperactive affective system, played a key role in generating driving policies for young drivers. Most states impose Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) laws. GDL is a licensing system for novice drivers that has proven effective at reducing adolescent drivers’ fatal and injury crashes by 38% and 40%, respectively (Baker et al., 2007Baker S.P. Chen L. Li G. Nationwide Review of Graduated Driver Licensing. AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, Washington, DC2007Google Scholar). It has three stages of licensure: (1) a learner’s permit that allows driving only while supervised by a fully licensed adult driver; (2) a probationary license that prohibits unsupervised nighttime driving and imposes passenger limits; and (3) a full license at 18 years old. These stages reflect our current understanding of adolescent brain and behavior development: the first recognizes that adolescents are inexperienced with behavioral regulation compared to adults and therefore benefit from adult supervision. The second stage reflects the empirical and anecdotal knowledge that adolescents are more susceptible to distraction, particularly social distraction, than adults. Finally, the very nature of being a graduated policy is reflective of the understanding that the adolescent brain changes in response to experience, ontogeny, and skill and that changing neural systems are directly related to increasing sophistication in behavior and decision making. The implications of neuroscience research will become increasingly relevant in domains other than the legal system and driving privileges. Recent attention on the potentially deleterious effects of sports-related concussions on brain development and injury is one such example. In the last year alone, several events, including the first-ever White House summit on the issue, lawsuits between the National Football League and former players, and a $10 million grant by Steve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants, to the UCLA School of Medicine, has fueled a national conversation about this important public health concern. In particular, there is a focus on characterizing the extent of brain damage in young athletes. A recent investigation reported over 200 sports-related deaths of young athletes between 2008 and 2011 (http://www.nata.org) and during 2001–2009, an estimated 2,651,581 youth less than 19 years old were treated annually for sports- and recreation-related injuries (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011Centers for Disease Control and PreventionMMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 2011; 60: 1337-1342PubMed Google Scholar). The grant to UCLA is to train pediatric neurologists specializing in sports concussions and research on how to prevent, diagnose, and treat the injuries among young athletes. This clinically relevant research will undoubtedly benefit from basic neuroscience research on the adolescent brain, which has already demonstrated both its vulnerability and resilience. A deeper understanding of the substantive neurobiological and psychological impact of sports-related injuries on the developing brain will help inform strategies to reduce, prevent, and treat avoidable tragedies. Despite the research advances, one issue that will continue to arise is how to incorporate the vast individual variation in adolescent behavior and neurodevelopment. Clearly, scientists recognize that behavior and brain development are highly variable across individuals but most research on the adolescent brain and all research that has been referenced in legal and policy contexts is based on group data. This is largely because of methodological constraints that necessitate inference based on a large number of research participants. One looming question that makes translation from laboratories to courtrooms challenging, therefore, is whether generic guidelines about maturation can be established based on neuroscience research or is individual variation so great as to preclude the establishment of a biological benchmark for adult-like maturity and judgment? Using multivariate pattern analysis methods, recent work has suggested that the field has made progress in using brain scans to assess functional maturation of individual brains (Dosenbach et al., 2010Dosenbach N.U. Nardos B. Cohen A.L. Fair D.A. Power J.D. Church J.A. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Vogel A.C. Lessov-Schlaggar C.N. et al.Science. 2010; 329: 1358-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). Importantly, this report highlights that variability of brain maturation is as great within ages as it is between ages. For instance, within the 15 year olds in their sample, there is considerable variability in the brain maturation index (ranging from ∼0.4 functional connectivity maturation index [fcMI] to 2.2 fcMI) that is as large a range as between the 10 year olds and the adults in their late 20s (Dosenbach et al., 2010Dosenbach N.U. Nardos B. Cohen A.L. Fair D.A. Power J.D. Church J.A. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Vogel A.C. Lessov-Schlaggar C.N. et al.Science. 2010; 329: 1358-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar, Figure 1). This example underscores how imprecise age is as an index of cognitive maturation. Despite this, it is the only index currently used to determine eligibility for most privileges in this country, including driving, voting, marrying, purchasing alcohol and cigarettes, and serving in the military. Parents and scholars know that having reached the age at which involvement in an activity is legal is not necessarily equated with the developmental maturity the activity requires. In the future, perhaps it will be wiser to consider establishing guidelines based on skill rather than age, a marker that will differ among individuals based on underlying brain development. This is an exciting time for research on the adolescent brain. Never before has there been so much communication between diverse disciplines and scholars in applied fields. Nonetheless, a significant challenge is to meaningfully apply evolving research that changes as rapidly as neuromethodological tools materialize to immediate legal and policy puzzles. Science is an arduous and lengthy process that sometimes challenges existing literature. Although this method leads to credible scientific conclusions, it makes it more difficult for law and policymakers to apply the science to practice. It is therefore the responsibility of scientists to ensure that the research is appropriately interpreted and that nonscientists integrate multiple strands of research into a solid grasp of the data."
https://openalex.org/W2081562519,"We examined whether the preparation of saccadic eye movements, when behaviorally dissociated from covert attention, modulates activity within visual cortex. We measured single-neuron and local field potential (LFP) responses to visual stimuli in area V4 while monkeys covertly attended a stimulus at one location and prepared saccades to a potential target at another. In spite of the irrelevance of visual information at the saccade target, visual activity at that location was modulated at least as much as, and often more than, activity at the covertly attended location. Modulations of activity at the attended and saccade target locations were qualitatively similar and included increased response magnitude, stimulus selectivity, and spiking reliability, as well as increased gamma and decreased low-frequency power of LFPs. These results demonstrate that saccade preparation is sufficient to modulate visual cortical representations and suggest that the interrelationship of oculomotor and attention-related mechanisms extends to posterior visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2001334995,"Grid cell responses develop gradually after eye opening, but little is known about the rules that govern this process. We present a biologically plausible model for the formation of a grid cell network. An asymmetric spike time-dependent plasticity rule acts upon an initially unstructured network of spiking neurons that receive inputs encoding animal velocity and location. Neurons develop an organized recurrent architecture based on the similarity of their inputs, interacting through inhibitory interneurons. The mature network can convert velocity inputs into estimates of animal location, showing that spatially periodic responses and the capacity of path integration can arise through synaptic plasticity, acting on inputs that display neither. The model provides numerous predictions about the necessity of spatial exploration for grid cell development, network topography, the maturation of velocity tuning and neural correlations, the abrupt transition to stable patterned responses, and possible mechanisms to set grid period across grid modules."
https://openalex.org/W1991291235,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have attracted considerable attentions due to their unique properties and diverse applications. Although it has been reported that AgNPs have acute toxic effects on a variety of cultured mammalian cells and animal models, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the associated risk of AgNPs to human health at non-cytotoxic doses. In this paper, HepG2 cells were exposed to 10 nm and 100 nm AgNPs under non-cytotoxic conditions, and cell viability was assessed. At low doses, AgNPs displayed “hormesis” effects by accelerating cell proliferation. Further studies indicated that the activation states of MAPKs were differentially regulated in this process. Specifically, by increasing the expression of downstream genes, p38 MAPK played a central role in non-cytotoxic AgNP-induced hormesis. Moreover, the treatment of HepG2 cells with silver ions (Ag+) at the same dose levels induced distinct biological effects, suggesting that different intrinsic properties exist for AgNPs and Ag+."
https://openalex.org/W2037036613,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing severe respiratory illness in infants and immune compromised patients. The ciliated cells of the human airway epithelium have been considered to be the exclusive target of RSV, although recent data have suggested that basal cells, the progenitors for the conducting airway epithelium, may also become infected in vivo. Using either mechanical or chemical injury models, we have demonstrated a robust RSV infection of p63+ basal cells in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells. In addition, proliferating basal cells in 2D culture were also susceptible to RSV infection. We therefore tested the hypothesis that RSV infection of this progenitor cell would influence the differentiation status of the airway epithelium. RSV infection of basal cells on the day of seeding (MOI≤0.0001), resulted in the formation of an epithelium that showed a profound loss of ciliated cells and gain of secretory cells as assessed by acetylated α-tubulin and MUC5AC/MUC5B immunostaining, respectively. The mechanism driving the switch in epithelial phenotype is in part driven by the induced type I and type III interferon response that we demonstrate is triggered early following RSV infection. Neutralization of this response attenuates the RSV-induced loss of ciliated cells. Together, these data show that through infection of proliferating airway basal cells, RSV has the potential to influence the cellular composition of the airway epithelium. The resulting phenotype might be expected to contribute towards both the severity of acute infection, as well as to the longer-term consequences of viral exacerbations in patients with pre-existing respiratory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2084844419,"Peptides and proteins play an important role in skin health and well-being. They are also found to contribute to skin aging and melanogenesis. Microneedles have been shown to substantially enhance skin penetration and may offer an effective means of peptide delivery enhancement. The aim of this investigation was to assess the influence of microneedles on the skin penetration of peptides using fluorescence imaging to determine skin distribution. In particular the effect of peptide chain length (3, 4, 5 amino acid chain length) on passive and MN facilitated skin penetration was investigated. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to image fluorescence intensity and the area of penetration of fluorescently tagged peptides. Penetration studies were conducted on excised full thickness human skin in Franz type diffusion cells for 1 and 24 hours. A 2 to 22 fold signal improvement in microneedle enhanced delivery of melanostatin, rigin and pal-KTTKS was observed. To our knowledge this is the first description of microneedle enhanced skin permeation studies on these peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2087481470,"Drought tolerance is an important breeding target for enhancing the yields of grain crop species in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Two species of Setaria, domesticated foxtail millet (S. italica) and its wild ancestor green foxtail (S. viridis) are becoming widely adopted as models for functional genomics studies in the Panicoid grasses. In this study, the genomic regions controlling germination and early seedling drought tolerance in Setaria were identified using 190 F7 lines derived from a cross between Yugu1, a S. italica cultivar developed in China, and a wild S. viridis genotype collected from Uzbekistan. Quantitative trait loci were identified which contribute to a number of traits including promptness index, radical root length, coleoptile length and lateral root number at germinating stage and seedling survival rate was characterized by the ability of desiccated seedlings to revive after rehydration. A genetic map with 128 SSR markers which spans 1293.9 cM with an average of 14 markers per linkage group of the 9 linkage groups was constructed. A total of eighteen QTLs were detected which included nine that explained over 10% of the phenotypic variance for a given trait. Both the wild green foxtail genotype and the foxtail millet cultivar contributed the favorite alleles for traits detected in this trial, indicating that wild Setaria viridis populations may serve as a reservoir for novel stress tolerance alleles which could be employed in foxtail millet breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2093783828,"Background Incidence of postoperative pain has been reported to be between 47–100%. Ineffective postoperative pain management results in tangible and intangible costs. The purpose of this study was to assess the processes and outcomes of pain management in the surgical wards of Jimma University Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia. Methods and Findings A prospective cross sectional study was conducted among 252 postoperative patients during February 13 to April 30, 2012. A contextually modified and validated (Cronbach’s α coefficient of 0.78) American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire was used to assess pain experience of patients. Patients’ charts were reviewed to assess the pattern of analgesic use. Incidence of postoperative pain was 91.4%, and remained high over 3 measurements (McNemar’s; p<0.05), and 80.1% of the patients were undertreated. The mean pain intensity, and pain interference on functional status were 6.72±1.44 and 5.61±1.13 on a 10 point Numerical rating scale respectively; both being strongly correlated(r = 0.86: p<0.001). Pain intensity was varied by ethnicity, education and preoperative information (ANOVA; P<0.05). Only 50% of the patients were adequately satisfied with their pain management. As needed (prn), solo analgesic, null analgesic, and intramuscular orders were noted for 31.3%, 89.29%, 9.7% and 20.1% of the prescription orders respectively. Though under dose, diclofenac and tramadol were the top prescribed medications, and only 57% of their dose was administered. Linear regression model showed that the predictors of satisfaction were sex of an individual and pain interference with functional status. Conclusion Despite patients’ paradoxical high satisfaction with pain management, the majority of patients were inadequately and inappropriately treated. Thus, further research is needed to determine how best to break down current barriers to effective pain management."
https://openalex.org/W2087131613,"Similarly to related developments such as blended learning and blended care, blended working is a pervasive and booming trend in modern societies. Blended working combines on-site and off-site working in an optimal way to improve workers’ and organizations’ outcomes. In this paper, we examine the degree to which workers feel that the two defining features of blended working (i.e., time-independent working and location-independent working) enhance their own functioning in their jobs. Blended working, enabled through the continuing advance and improvement of high-tech ICT software, devices, and infrastructure, may be considered beneficial for workers’ perceived effectiveness because it increases their job autonomy. However, because blended working may have downsides as well, it is important to know for whom blended working may (not) work. As hypothesized, in a sample of 348 workers (51.7% women), representing a wide range of occupations and organizations, we found that the perceived personal effectiveness of blended working was contingent upon workers’ psychological need strength. Specifically, the perceived effectiveness of both time-independent working and location-independent working was positively related to individuals’ need for autonomy at work, and negatively related to their need for relatedness and need for structure at work."
https://openalex.org/W2052480977,"A dominant feature of neural circuitry is the organization of neuronal projections and synapses into specific brain nuclei or laminae. Lamina-specific connectivity is controlled by the selective expression of extracellular guidance and adhesion molecules in the target field. However, how (sub)nucleus-specific connections are established and whether axon-derived cues contribute to subdomain targeting are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the lateral subnucleus of the habenula (lHb) determines its own afferent innervation by sending out efferent projections that express the cell adhesion molecule LAMP to reciprocally collect and guide dopaminergic afferents to the lHb-a phenomenon we term subdomain-mediated axon-axon signaling. This process of reciprocal axon-axon interactions cooperates with lHb-specific chemoattraction mediated by Netrin-1, which controls axon target entry, to ensure specific innervation of the lHb. We propose that cooperation between pretarget reciprocal axon-axon signaling and subdomain-restricted instructive cues provides a highly precise and general mechanism to establish subdomain-specific neural circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2110367804,"Many open problems in bioinformatics involve elucidating underlying functional signals in biological sequences. DNA sequences, in particular, are characterized by rich architectures in which functional signals are increasingly found to combine local and distal interactions at the nucleotide level. Problems of interest include detection of regulatory regions, splice sites, exons, hypersensitive sites, and more. These problems naturally lend themselves to formulation as classification problems in machine learning. When classification is based on features extracted from the sequences under investigation, success is critically dependent on the chosen set of features.We present an algorithmic framework (EFFECT) for automated detection of functional signals in biological sequences. We focus here on classification problems involving DNA sequences which state-of-the-art work in machine learning shows to be challenging and involve complex combinations of local and distal features. EFFECT uses a two-stage process to first construct a set of candidate sequence-based features and then select a most effective subset for the classification task at hand. Both stages make heavy use of evolutionary algorithms to efficiently guide the search towards informative features capable of discriminating between sequences that contain a particular functional signal and those that do not.To demonstrate its generality, EFFECT is applied to three separate problems of importance in DNA research: the recognition of hypersensitive sites, splice sites, and ALU sites. Comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms show that the framework is both general and powerful. In addition, a detailed analysis of the constructed features shows that they contain valuable biological information about DNA architecture, allowing biologists and other researchers to directly inspect the features and potentially use the insights obtained to assist wet-laboratory studies on retainment or modification of a specific signal.

https://openalex.org/W1981204537,"Background/Purpose Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially in severe forms, is commonly associated with multiple cognitive problems. Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA) is used to detect cognitive impairment evaluating several areas: visuospatial, memory, attention and fluency. Our study aim was to evaluate the impact of stable COPD and exacerbation (AECOPD) phases on cognitive status using MoCA questionnaire. Methods We enrolled 39 patients (pts), smokers with COPD group D (30 stable and 9 in AECOPD) and 13 healthy subjects (control group), having similar level of education and no significant differences regarding the anthropometric measurements. We analyzed the differences in MoCA score between these three groups and also the correlation between this score and inflammatory markers. Results Patients with AECOPD had a significant (p<0.001) decreased MoCA score (14.6±3.4) compared to stable COPD (20.2±2.4) and controls (24.2±5.8). The differences between groups were more accentuated for the language abstraction and attention (p<0.001) and delayed recall and orientation (p<0.001) sub-topics. No significant variance of score was observed between groups regarding visuospatial and naming score (p = 0.095). The MoCA score was significantly correlated with forced expiratory volume (r = 0.28) and reverse correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) (r = −0.57), fibrinogen (r = −0.58), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (r = −0.55) and with the partial pressure of CO2 (r = −0.47). Conclusions According to this study, COPD significantly decreases the cognitive status in advanced and acute stages of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2025099161,"Up-regulated sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent class III histone deacetylase, deacetylates p53 and inhibits its transcriptional activity, leading to cell survival. SIRT1 overexpression has been reported to predict poor survival in some malignancies, including gastric cancer. However, the antitumor effect of SIRT1 inhibition remains elusive in gastric cancer. Here, we investigated the antitumor mechanisms of a sirtuin inhibitor, tenovin-6, in seven human gastric cancer cell lines (four cell lines with wild-type TP53, two with mutant-type TP53, and one with null TP53). Interestingly, tenovin-6 induced apoptosis in all cell lines, not only those with wild-type TP53, but also mutant-type and null versions, accompanied by up-regulation of death receptor 5 (DR5). In the KatoIII cell line (TP53-null), DR5 silencing markedly attenuated tenovin-6-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the pivotal mechanism behind its antitumor effects is based on activation of the death receptor signal pathway. Although endoplasmic reticulum stress caused by sirtuin inhibitors was reported to induce DR5 up-regulation in other cancer cell lines, we could not find marked activation of its related molecules, such as ATF6, PERK, and CHOP, in gastric cancer cells treated with tenovin-6. Tenovin-6 in combination with docetaxel or SN-38 exerted a slight to moderate synergistic cytotoxicity against gastric cancer cells. In conclusion, tenovin-6 has potent antitumor activity against human gastric cancer cells via DR5 up-regulation. Our results should be helpful for the future clinical development of sirtuin inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2070126069,"Sediments from Xinyun Lake in central Yunnan, southwest China, provide a record of environmental history since the Holocene. With the application of multi-proxy indicators (total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), δ13C and δ15N isotopes, C/N ratio, grain size, magnetic susceptibility (MS) and CaCO3 content), as well as accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C datings, four major climatic stages during the Holocene have been identified in Xingyun′s catchment. A marked increase in lacustrine palaeoproductivity occurred from 11.06 to 9.98 cal. ka BP, which likely resulted from an enhanced Asian southwest monsoon and warm-humid climate. Between 9.98 and 5.93 cal. ka BP, a gradually increased lake level might have reached the optimum water depth, causing a marked decline in coverage by aquatic plants and lake productivity of the lake. This was caused by strong Asian southwest monsoon, and coincided with the global Holocene Optimum. During the period of 5.60–1.35 cal. ka BP, it resulted in a warm and dry climate at this stage, which is comparable to the aridification of India during the mid- and late Holocene. The intensifying human activity and land-use in the lake catchment since the early Tang Dynasty (∼1.35 cal. ka BP) were associated with the ancient Dian culture within Xingyun’s catchment. The extensive deforestation and development of agriculture in the lake catchment caused heavy soil loss. Our study clearly shows that long-term human activities and land-use change have strongly impacted the evolution of the lake environment and therefore modulated the sediment records of the regional climate in central Yunnan for more than one thousand years."
https://openalex.org/W2032905483,"Alpha-hemolysin (Hla) is a major virulence factor in the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus infection, being active against a wide range of host cells. Although hla is ubiquitous in S. aureus, its genetic diversity and variation in expression in different genetic backgrounds is not known. We evaluated nucleotide sequence variation and gene expression profiles of hla among representatives of hospital (HA) and community-associated (CA) S. aureus clones.51 methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 22 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were characterized by PFGE, spa typing, MLST and SCCmec typing. The internal regions of hla and the hla promoter were sequenced and gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR.Alpha-hemolysin encoding- and promoter sequences were diverse, with 12 and 23 different alleles, respectively. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we suggest that hla may have evolved together with the S. aureus genetic background, except for ST22, ST121, ST59 and ST93. Conversely, the promoter region showed lack of co-evolution with the genetic backgrounds. Four non-synonymous amino acid changes were identified close to important regions of hla activity. Amino acid changes in the RNAIII binding site were not associated to hla expression. Although expression rates of hla were in general strain-specific, we observed CA clones showed significantly higher hla expression (p = 0.003) when compared with HA clones.We propose that the hla gene has evolved together with the genetic background. Overall, CA genetic backgrounds showed higher levels of hla expression than HA, and a high strain-to-strain variation of gene expression was detected in closely related strains."
https://openalex.org/W2029536182,"A metatranscriptomic approach was used to study community gene expression in a naturally occurring iron-rich microbial mat. Total microbial community RNA was reversely transcribed and sequenced by pyrosequencing. Characterization of expressed gene sequences provided accurate and detailed information of the composition of the transcriptionally active community and revealed phylogenetic and functional stratifications within the mat. Comparison of 16S rRNA reads and delineation of OTUs showed significantly lower values of metatranscriptomic-based richness and diversity in the upper parts of the mat than in the deeper regions. Taxonomic affiliation of rRNA sequences and mRNA genome recruitments indicated that iron-oxidizing bacteria affiliated to the genus Leptothrix, dominated the community in the upper layers of the mat. Surprisingly, type I methanotrophs contributed to the majority of the sequences in the deep layers of the mat. Analysis of mRNA expression patterns showed that genes encoding the three subunits of the particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoCAB) were the most highly expressed in our dataset. These results provide strong hints that iron-oxidation and methane-oxidation occur simultaneously in microbial mats and that both groups of microorganisms are major players in the functioning of this ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2066464050,"Elevated level of reactive carbonyl species, such as methylglyoxal, triggers carbonyl stress and activates a series of inflammatory responses leading to accelerated vascular damage. Edaravone is the active substance of a Japanese medicine, which aids neurological recovery following acute brain ischemia and subsequent cerebral infarction. Our aim was to test whether edaravone can exert a protective effect on the barrier properties of human brain endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3 cell line) treated with methylglyoxal.Cell viability was monitored in real-time by impedance-based cell electronic sensing. The barrier function of the monolayer was characterized by measurement of resistance and flux of permeability markers, and visualized by immunohistochemistry for claudin-5 and β-catenin. Cell morphology was also examined by holographic phase imaging.Methylglyoxal exerted a time- and dose-dependent toxicity on cultured human brain endothelial cells: a concentration of 600 µM resulted in about 50% toxicity, significantly reduced the integrity and increased the permeability of the barrier. The cell morphology also changed dramatically: the area of cells decreased, their optical height significantly increased. Edaravone (3 mM) provided a complete protection against the toxic effect of methylglyoxal. Co-administration of edaravone restored cell viability, barrier integrity and functions of brain endothelial cells. Similar protection was obtained by the well-known antiglycating molecule, aminoguanidine, our reference compound.These results indicate for the first time that edaravone is protective in carbonyl stress induced barrier damage. Our data may contribute to the development of compounds to treat brain endothelial dysfunction in carbonyl stress related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2062492948,"Purpose To characterize intermediate and high-risk prostate carcinomas with measurements of standardized uptake values (SUVs) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values by means of simultaneous [18F] choline PET/MRI. Materials and Methods 35 patients with primary prostate cancer underwent simultaneous [18F] choline PET/MRI. From these, 21 patients with an intermediate and high risk constellation who were not under ongoing hormonal therapy were included. Altogether 32 tumor lesions with a focal uptake of [18F] choline could be identified. Average ADC values (ADCaver) minimum ADC values (ADCmin) as well as maximum and mean SUVs (SUVmax, SUVmean) of tumor lesions were assessed with volume-of-interest (VOI) and Region-of-interest (ROI) measurements. As a reference, also ADCaver, ADCmin and SUVmax and SUVmean of non-tumorous prostate tissue were measured. Statistical analysis comprised calculation of descriptive parameters and calculation of Pearson’s product moment correlations between ADC values and SUVs of tumor lesions. Results Mean ADCaver and ADCmin of tumor lesions were 0.94±0.22×10−3 mm2/s and 0.65±0.21×10−3 mm2/s, respectively. Mean SUVmax and SUVmean of tumor lesions were 6.3±2.3 and 2.6±0.8, respectively. These values were in each case significantly different from the reference values (p<0.001). There was no significant correlation between the measured SUVs and ADC values (SUVmax vs. ADCaver: R = −0.24, p = 0.179; SUVmax vs. ADCmin: R = −0.03, p = 0.877; SUVmean vs. ADCaver: R = −0.27, p = 0.136; SUVmean vs. ADCmin: R = −0.08, p = 0.679). Conclusion Both SUVs and ADC values differ significantly between tumor lesions and healthy tissue. However, there is no significant correlation between these two parameters. This might be explained by the fact that SUVs and ADC values characterize different parts of tumor biology."
https://openalex.org/W2067063281,"The human hCLCA1 and its murine ortholog mCLCA3 (calcium-activated chloride channel regulators) are exclusively expressed in mucus cells and linked to inflammatory airway diseases with increased mucus production, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Both proteins have a known impact on the mucus cell metaplasia trait in these diseases. However, growing evidence points towards an additional role in innate immune responses. In the current study, we analyzed Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, an established model to study pulmonary innate immunity, in mCLCA3-deficient and wild-type mice, focusing on the cellular and cytokine-driven innate inflammatory response. We compared clinical signs, bacterial clearance, leukocyte immigration and cytokine responses in the bronchoalveolar compartment, as well as pulmonary vascular permeability, histopathology, mucus cell number and mRNA expression levels of selected genes (mClca1 to 7, Muc5ac, Muc5b, Muc2, Cxcl-1, Cxcl-2, Il-17). Deficiency of mCLCA3 resulted in decreased neutrophilic infiltration into the bronchoalveolar space during bacterial infection. Only the cytokines IL-17 and the murine CXCL-8 homolog CXCL-1 were decreased on mRNA and protein levels during bacterial infection in mCLCA3-deficient mice compared to wild-type controls. However, no differences in clinical outcome, histopathology or mucus cell metaplasia were observed. We did not find evidence for regulation of any other CLCA homolog that would putatively compensate for the lack of mCLCA3. In conclusion, mCLCA3 appears to modulate leukocyte response via IL-17 and murine CXCL-8 homologs in acute Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which is well in line with the proposed function of hCLCA1 as a signaling molecule acting on alveolar macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2053050283,"Airway epithelial cells are the first line of defense against viral infections and are instrumental in coordinating the inflammatory response. In this study, we demonstrate the synergistic stimulation of CXCL10 mRNA and protein, a key chemokine responsible for the early immune response to viral infection, following treatment of airway epithelial cells with IFN γ and influenza virus. The synergism also occurred when the cells were treated with IFN γ and a viral replication mimicker (dsRNA) both in vitro and in vivo. Despite the requirement of type I interferon (IFNAR) signaling in dsRNA-induced CXCL10, the synergism was independent of the IFNAR pathway since it wasn’t affected by the addition of a neutralizing IFNAR antibody or the complete lack of IFNAR expression. Furthermore, the same synergistic effect was also observed when a CXCL10 promoter reporter was examined. Although the responsive promoter region contains both ISRE and NFκB sites, western blot analysis indicated that the combined treatment of IFN γ and dsRNA significantly augmented NFκB but not STAT1 activation as compared to the single treatment. Therefore, we conclude that IFN γ and dsRNA act in concert to potentiate CXCL10 expression in airway epithelial cells via an NFκB-dependent but IFNAR-STAT independent pathway and it is at least partly regulated at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2069508183,"Background The incidence rate of active tuberculosis (TB) disease in the Canadian Territory of Nunavut has shown a rising trend over the past 10 years. In 2010 it was 60 times greater than the national incidence rate. The objective of the Taima (translates to “stop” in Inuktitut) TB study was to implement and evaluate a public health campaign to enhance existing TB prevention efforts in Nunavut. Methods A TB awareness campaign followed by a door-to-door screening campaign was carried out in Iqaluit, Nunavut. The aim of the campaign was to raise awareness about TB, and to provide in-home screening and treatment for people living in residential areas at high risk for TB. Screening was based on geographic location rather than on individual risk factors. Results During the general awareness campaign an increase in the number of people who requested TB testing at the local public health clinic was observed. However, this increase was not sustained following cessation of the awareness campaign. Targeted TB screening in high risk residential areas in Iqaluit resulted in 224 individuals having TSTs read, and detection of 42 previously unidentified cases of latent TB, (overall yield of 18.8% or number needed to screen = 5.3). These cases of latent TB infection (LTBI) were extra cases that had not been picked up by traditional screening practices (34% relative increase within the community). This resulted in a 33% relative increase in the completion of LTBI treatment within the community. The program directly and indirectly identified 5/17 new cases of active TB disease in Iqaluit during the study period (29.5% of all incident cases). Conclusions While contact tracing investigations remain a cornerstone of TB prevention, additional awareness, screening, and treatment programs like Taima TB may contribute to the successful control of TB in Aboriginal communities."

HMW DNA is desirable for next generation sequencing as it yields the most comprehensive coverage. Several DNA extraction procedures were compared from samples that exhibit strong nucleic acid adsorption. pH manipulation or use of alternative ion solutions offered no improvement in nucleic acid recovery. Lysis by liquid N2 grinding in concentrated guanidine followed by concentrated sodium phosphate extraction supported HMW DNA recovery from clays high in iron oxides. DNA recovered using 1 M sodium phosphate buffer (PB) as a competitive desorptive wash was 15.22±2.33 µg DNA/g clay, with most DNA consisting of >20 Kb fragments, compared to 2.46±0.25 µg DNA/g clay with the Powerlyzer system (MoBio). Increasing PB concentration in the lysis reagent coincided with increasing DNA fragment length during initial extraction. Rarefaction plots of 16S rRNA (V1–V3 region) pyrosequencing from A-horizon and clay soils showed an ∼80% and ∼400% larger accessed diversity compared to the Powerlyzer soil DNA system, respectively. The observed diversity from the Firmicutes showed the strongest increase with >3-fold more operational taxonomic units (OTU) recovered."
https://openalex.org/W2010322700,"Oocyte freezing confers thermal and chemical stress upon the oolemma and various other intracellular structures due to the formation of ice crystals. The lipid profiles of oocytes and embryos are closely associated with both, the degrees of their membrane fluidity, as well as the degree of chilling and freezing injuries that may occur during cryopreservation. In spite of the importance of lipids in the process of cryopreservation, the phospholipid status in oocytes and embryos before and after freezing has not been investigated. In this study, we employed mass spectrometric analysis to examine if vitrification has an effect on the phospholipid profiles of mouse oocytes. Freshly prepared metaphase II mouse oocytes were vitrified using copper grids and stored in liquid nitrogen for 2 weeks. Fresh and vitrified-warmed oocytes were subjected to phospholipid extraction procedure. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed that multiple species of phospholipids are reduced in vitrified-warmed oocytes. LIFT analyses identified 31 underexpressed and 5 overexpressed phospholipids in vitrified mouse oocytes. The intensities of phosphatidylinositol (PI) {18∶2/16∶0} [M-H]- and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) {14∶0/18∶2} [M-H]- were decreased the most with fold changes of 30.5 and 19.1 in negative ion mode, respectively. Several sphingomyelins (SM) including SM {d38∶3} [M+H]+ and SM {d34∶0} [M+K]+ were decreased significantly in positive ion mode. Overall, the declining trend of multiple phospholipids demonstrates that vitrification has a marked effect on phospholipid profiles of oocytes. These results show that the identified phospholipids can be used as potential biomarkers of oocyte undergoing vitrification and will allow for the development of strategies to preserve phospholipids during oocyte cryopreservation."

The natural history of oral HPV in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) is unclear. Methods Detection of oral human papillomavirus in 173 HIV-positive MSM using oral rinse samples 3 years apart was investigated. HPV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction, and genotyped by Roche Linear Array. Results Of 173 men tested in 2010, 30 had at least one HPV genotype (17%, 95% CI: 12–23), 15 at least one hr-HPV (9%, 95% CI: 5–14) and 8 had HPV 16 (5%, 95% CI: 2–9) detected. In 2013, 33 had at least one HPV genotype (19%, 95% CI: 14–26), 20 had at least one hr-HPV (12%, 95% CI: 7–17) and 7 had HPV 16 (4%, 95% CI: 2–8) detected. Of 30 men at baseline (2010) with any HPV detected, 14 (47%, 95% CI: 28–66) had at least one persistent genotype. Of the 15 men in 2010 with high risk (hr-) HPV, 6 men (40%, 95% CI: 16–68) had at least one persistent hr-HPV genotype. The incidence rate of detection of at least one new HPV genotype was 4.8 per 100 person years (95% CI: 3.1–7.0), of at least one hr-HPV genotype was 3.2 per 100 person years (95% CI: 1.8–5.1) and of HPV 16 was 0.8 per 100 person years (95% CI: 0.2–2.0). The clearance rate was 14.9 per 100 person years (95% CI: 8.2–24.2) for any HPV, 18.2 per 100 person years (95% CI: 8.2–32.7) for hr-HPV and 17.4 per 100 person years (95% CI: 5.0–38.8) for HPV-16. Persistent HPV detection was associated with duration of HIV (OR 1.13 (per additional year), 95% CI: 1.00–1.26) and tonsillectomy (OR 8.17, 95% CI: 1.30–51.40). Conclusion The same oral HPV genotype was detected again after 3 years in nearly half of HIV-positive men who have sex with men."
https://openalex.org/W1972411628,"Non-random female mating preferences may contribute to the maintenance of phenotypic variation in color polymorphic species. However, the effect of female preference depends on the types of male traits used as signals by receptive females. If preference signals derive from discrete male traits (i.e., morph-specific), female preferences may rapidly fix to a morph. However, female preference signals may also include condition-dependent male traits. In this scenario, female preference may differ depending on the social context (i.e., male morph availability). Male tree lizards (Urosaurus ornatus) exhibit a dewlap color polymorphism that covaries with mating behavior. Blue morph males are aggressive and defend territories, yellow males are less aggressive and defend smaller territories, and orange males are typically nomadic. Female U. ornatus are also polymorphic in dewlap color, but the covariation between dewlap color and female behavior is unknown. We performed an experiment to determine how female mate choice depends on the visual and chemical signals produced by males. We also tested whether female morphs differ in their preferences for these signals. Female preferences involved both male dewlap color and size of the ventral color patch. However, the female morphs responded to these signals differently and depended on the choice between the types of male morphs. Our experiment revealed that females may be capable of distinguishing among the male morphs using chemical signals alone. Yellow females exhibit preferences based on both chemical and visual signals, which may be a strategy to avoid ultra-dominant males. In contrast, orange females may prefer dominant males. We conclude that female U. ornatus morphs differ in mating behavior. Our findings also provide evidence for a chemical polymorphism among male lizards in femoral pore secretions."
https://openalex.org/W2030262674,"Focal adhesions (FAs), integrin-mediated macromolecular complexes located at the cell membrane extracellular interface, have been shown to regulate cell adhesion and migration. Our previous studies have indicated that HAb18G/CD147 (CD147) is involved in cytoskeleton reorganization and FA formation in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. In the current study, we determined that CD147 was involved in vinculin-mediated FA focal adhesion formation in HCC cells. We also found that deletion of CD147 led to reduced vinculin-mediated FA areas (P<0.0001), length/width ratios (P<0.0001), and mean intensities (P<0.0001). CD147 promoted lamellipodia formation by localizing Arp2/3 to the leading edge of the cell. Deletion of CD147 significantly reduced the fluorescence (t1/2) recovery times (22.7±3.3 s) of vinculin-mediated focal adhesions (P<0.0001). In cell-spreading assays, CD147 was found to be essential for dynamic focal adhesion enlargement and disassembly. Furthermore, the current data showed that CD147 reduced tyrosine phosphorylation in vinculin-mediated focal adhesions, and enhanced the accumulation of the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Together, these results revealed that CD147 is involved in vinculin-mediated focal adhesion formation, which subsequently promotes cytoskeleton reorganization to facilitate invasion and migration of human HCC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2032303163,"Many species of Drosophila form conspecific pupa aggregations across the breeding sites. These aggregations could result from species-specific larval odor recognition. To test this hypothesis we used larval odors of D. melanogaster and D. pavani, two species that coexist in the nature. When stimulated by those odors, wild type and vestigial (vg) third-instar larvae of D. melanogaster pupated on conspecific larval odors, but individuals deficient in the expression of the odor co-receptor Orco randomly pupated across the substrate, indicating that in this species, olfaction plays a role in pupation site selection. Larvae are unable to learn but can smell, the Syn97CS and rut strains of D. melanogaster, did not respond to conspecific odors or D. pavani larval cues, and they randomly pupated across the substrate, suggesting that larval odor-based learning could influence the pupation site selection. Thus, Orco, Syn97CS and rut loci participated in the pupation site selection. When stimulated by conspecific and D. melanogaster larval cues, D. pavani larvae also pupated on conspecific odors. The larvae of D. gaucha, a sibling species of D. pavani, did not respond to D. melanogaster larval cues, pupating randomly across the substrate. In nature, D. gaucha is isolated from D. melanogaster. Interspecific hybrids, which result from crossing pavani female with gaucha males clumped their pupae similarly to D. pavani, but the behavior of gaucha female x pavani male hybrids was similar to D. gaucha parent. The two sibling species show substantial evolutionary divergence in organization and functioning of larval nervous system. D. melanogaster and D. pavani larvae extracted information about odor identities and the spatial location of congener and alien larvae to select pupation sites. We hypothesize that larval recognition contributes to the cohabitation of species with similar ecologies, thus aiding the organization and persistence of Drosophila species guilds in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W2075428612,"Viral reservoirs-persistent residual virus despite combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-remain an obstacle to cure of HIV-1 infection. Difficulty studying reservoirs in patients underscores the need for animal models that mimics HIV infected humans on cART. We studied SIV-infected Chinese-origin rhesus macaques (Ch-RM) treated with intensive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and 3 weeks of treatment with the histone deacetyalse inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA).SIVmac251 infected Ch-RM received reverse transcriptase inhibitors PMPA and FTC and integrase inhibitor L-870812 beginning 7 weeks post infection. Integrase inhibitor L-900564 and boosted protease inhibitor treatment with Darunavir and Ritonavir were added later. cART was continued for 45 weeks, with daily SAHA administered for the last 3 weeks, followed by euthanasia/necropsy. Plasma viral RNA and cell/tissue-associated SIV gag RNA and DNA were quantified by qRT-PCR/qPCR, with flow cytometry monitoring changes in immune cell populations.Upon cART initiation, plasma viremia declined, remaining <30 SIV RNA copy Eq/ml during cART, with occasional blips. Decreased viral replication was associated with decreased immune activation and partial restoration of intestinal CD4+ T cells. SAHA was well tolerated but did not result in demonstrable treatment-associated changes in plasma or cell associated viral parameters.The ability to achieve and sustain virological suppression makes cART-suppressed, SIV-infected Ch-RM a potentially useful model to evaluate interventions targeting residual virus. However, despite intensive cART over one year, persistent viral DNA and RNA remained in tissues of all three animals. While well tolerated, three weeks of SAHA treatment did not demonstrably impact viral RNA levels in plasma or tissues; perhaps reflecting dosing, sampling and assay limitations."
https://openalex.org/W2040511947,"Previous analysis of the Cerberus like 2 knockout (Cerl2−/−) mouse revealed a significant mortality during the first day after birth, mostly due to cardiac defects apparently associated with randomization of the left-right axis. We have however, identified Cerl2-associated cardiac defects, particularly a large increase in the left ventricular myocardial wall in neonates that cannot be explained by laterality abnormalities. Therefore, in order to access the endogenous role of Cerl2 in cardiogenesis, we analyzed the embryonic and neonatal hearts of Cerl2 null mutants that did not display a laterality phenotype. Neonatal mutants obtained from the compound mouse line Cer2−/−::Mlc1v-nLacZ24+, in which the pulmonary ventricle is genetically marked, revealed a massive enlargement of the ventricular myocardium in animals without laterality defects. Echocardiography analysis in Cerl2−/− neonates showed a left ventricular systolic dysfunction that is incompatible with a long lifespan. We uncovered that the increased ventricular muscle observed in Cerl2−/− mice is caused by a high cardiomyocyte mitotic index in the compact myocardium which is mainly associated with increased Ccnd1 expression levels in the left ventricle at embryonic day (E) 13. Interestingly, at this stage we found augmented left ventricular expression of Cerl2 levels when compared with the right ventricle, which may elucidate the regionalized contribution of Cerl2 to the left ventricular muscle formation. Importantly, we observed an increase of phosphorylated Smad2 (pSmad2) levels in embryonic (E13) and neonatal hearts indicating a prolonged TGFβs/Nodal-signaling activation. Concomitantly, we detected an increase of Baf60c levels, but only in Cerl2−/− embryonic hearts. These results indicate that independently of its well-known role in left-right axis establishment Cerl2 plays an important role during heart development in the mouse, mediating Baf60c levels by exerting an important control of the TGFβs/Nodal-signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2086961200,"Congenital cataracts are one of the leading causes of visual impairment and blindness in children, and genetic factors play an important role in their development. This study aimed to identify the genetic defects associated with autosomal dominant congenital progressive punctate cataracts in a Chinese family and to explore the potential pathogenesis. Detailed family history and clinical data were recorded, and all the family members’ blood samples were collected for DNA extraction. Linkage analysis was performed by microsatellite markers that are associated with punctate cataracts, and logarithm (base 10) of odds (LOD) scores were calculated using the LINKAGE program. Positive two-point LOD scores were obtained at markers D12S1622 (Zmax = 2.71 at θ = 0.0), D12S1724 (Zmax = 2.71 at θ = 0.0), and D12S90 (Zmax = 2.71 at θ = 0.0), which flank the major intrinsic protein of lens fiber (MIP) gene on chromosomal region 12q13. Direct sequencing of the encoding region of the MIP gene revealed a novel mutation (G>D) in exon 4 at nucleotide 644, which caused a substitution of glycine to aspartic acid at codon 215 (p.G215D) for the MIP protein. The mutation cosegregated with all patients with congenital progressive punctate cataracts, but it was absent in the healthy members. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the mutation affects the function of the MIP protein. The wild type (WT) and G215D mutant of MIP were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) into Hela cells separately, and it was found that the G215D mutant was aberrantly located in the cytoplasm instead of in the plasma membrane. In summary, our study presented genetic and functional evidence linking the new MIP mutation of G215D to autosomal dominant congenital cataracts, which adds to the list of MIP mutations linked to congenital progressive punctate cataracts."
https://openalex.org/W2133214797,"Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV1 and HSV2) are common infectious agents in both industrialized and developing countries. They cause recurrent asymptomatic and/or symptomatic infections, and life-threatening diseases and death in newborns and immunocompromised patients. Current treatment for HSV relies on antiviral medications, which can halt the symptomatic diseases but cannot prevent the shedding that occurs in asymptomatic patients or, consequently, the spread of the viruses. Therefore, prevention rather than treatment of HSV infections has long been an area of intense research, but thus far effective anti-HSV vaccines still remain elusive. One of the key hurdles to overcome in anti-HSV vaccine development is the identification and effective use of strategies that promote the emergence of Th1-type immune responses against a wide range of epitopes involved in the control of viral replication. Since the HIV1 Tat protein has several immunomodulatory activities and increases CTL recognition of dominant and subdominant epitopes of heterologous antigens, we generated and assayed a recombinant attenuated replication-competent HSV1 vector containing the tat gene (HSV1-Tat). In this proof-of-concept study we show that immunization with this vector conferred protection in 100% of mice challenged intravaginally with a lethal dose of wild-type HSV1. We demonstrate that the presence of Tat within the recombinant virus increased and broadened Th1-like and CTL responses against HSV-derived T-cell epitopes and elicited in most immunized mice detectable IgG responses. In sharp contrast, a similarly attenuated HSV1 recombinant vector without Tat (HSV1-LacZ), induced low and different T cell responses, no measurable antibody responses and did not protect mice against the wild-type HSV1 challenge. These findings strongly suggest that recombinant HSV1 vectors expressing Tat merit further investigation for their potential to prevent and/or contain HSV1 infection and dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W2021018521,"Many parasitic organisms have an ability to manipulate their hosts to increase their own fitness. In parasitoids, behavioral changes of mobile hosts to avoid or protect against predation and hyperparasitism have been intensively studied, but host manipulation by parasitoids associated with endophytic or immobile hosts has seldom been investigated. We examined the interactions between a gall inducer Masakimyia pustulae (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) and its parasitoids. This gall midge induces dimorphic leaf galls, thick and thin types, on Euonymus japonicus (Celastraceae). Platygaster sp. was the most common primary parasitoid of M. pustulae. In galls attacked by Platygaster sp., whole gall thickness as well as thicknesses of upper and lower gall wall was significantly larger than unparasitized galls, regardless of the gall types, in many localities. In addition, localities and tree individuals significantly affected the thickness of gall. Galls attacked by Platygaster sp. were seldom hyperparasitized in the two gall types. These results strongly suggest that Platygaster sp. manipulates the host plant's development to avoid hyperparasitism by thickening galls."
https://openalex.org/W2015870617,"By simultaneously subjecting microbial cells to high amplitude pulsed electric fields and flash heating of the cell suspension fluid, effective release of intracellular contents was achieved. The synergistic effect of the applied electric field and elevated temperature on cell lysis in a flow-through device was demonstrated for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and Mycobacterium species. The resulting lysate is suitable for downstream nucleic acid amplification and detection without requiring further preparation. The lysis chamber employs surface enhanced blocking electrodes which possess an etched micro-structured surface and a thin layer of dielectric metal oxide which provides a large effective area and blocks transmission of electrical current. The surface enhanced blocking electrodes enable simultaneous suppression of the rapid onset of electric field screening in the bulk of the cell suspension medium and avoidance of undesired electrochemical processes at the electrode-electrolyte interface. In addition the blocking layer ensures the robustness of the cell lysis device in applications involving prolonged flow-through processing of the microbial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2094419031,"Our study investigated relationships between a precocial bird’s fearfulness and maternal care, and the implication of maternal care as a vector for non-genomic transmission of fearfulness to chicks. We compared care given to chicks between two sets of female Japanese quail selected to present either high (LTI) or low fearfulness (STI). Chicks, from a broiler line, were adopted by these females following a sensitization procedure. Chicks’ fearfulness after separation from their mother was assessed by well-established procedures. LTIs took longer to present maternal responses, pecked chicks more during the first days post-hatch, presented impaired maternal vocal behaviour and were globally less active than STI females. Chicks mothered by LTIs presented more fearful reactions than did chicks mothered by STIs, supporting the hypothesis of a non-genetic maternal transmission of fearfulness. We suggest that the longer latencies required by LTIs to become maternal are a consequence of their greater fear of chicks, and that their lower general and vocal activity could be components of a heightened antipredatory strategy. We discuss the transmission of maternal fearfulness to fostered chicks, taking into account the possible implication of several well-known mechanisms underlying maternal effects."
https://openalex.org/W1983900858,"Argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) is essential for recycling L-citrulline, the by-product of NO synthase (NOS), to the NOS substrate L-arginine. Here, we assessed whether disturbed arginine resynthesis modulates endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in normal and diabetic male mice.Endothelium-selective Ass-deficient mice (Assfl/fl/Tie2Cretg/- = Ass-KOTie2) were generated by crossing Assfl/fl mice ( = control) with Tie2Cre mice. Gene ablation in endothelial cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Blood pressure (MAP) was recorded in 34-week-old male mice. Vasomotor responses were studied in isolated saphenous arteries of 12- and 34-week-old Ass-KOTie2 and control animals. At the age of 10 weeks, diabetes was induced in control and Ass-KOTie2 mice by streptozotocin injections. Vasomotor responses of diabetic animals were studied 10 weeks later. MAP was similar in control and Ass-KOTie2 mice. Depletion of circulating L-arginine by arginase 1 infusion or inhibition of NOS activity with L-NAME resulted in an increased MAP (10 and 30 mmHg, respectively) in control and Ass-KOTie2 mice. Optimal arterial diameter, contractile responses to phenylephrine, and relaxing responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were similar in healthy control and Ass-KOTie2 mice. However, in diabetic Ass-KOTie2 mice, relaxation responses to acetylcholine and endothelium-derived NO (EDNO) were significantly reduced when compared to diabetic control mice.Absence of endothelial citrulline recycling to arginine did not affect blood pressure and systemic arterial vasomotor responses in healthy mice. EDNO-mediated vasodilatation was significantly more impaired in diabetic Ass-KOTie2 than in control mice demonstrating that endothelial arginine recycling becomes a limiting endothelial function in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2071206260,"Alcohol may induce metabolic and functional changes in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, contributing to impaired mucosal barrier function. Duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion (DBS) is a primary epithelial defense against gastric acid and also has an important function in maintaining the homeostasis of the juxtamucosal microenvironment. The aim in this study was to investigate the effects of the luminal perfusion of moderate concentrations of ethanol in vivo on epithelial DBS, fluid secretion and paracellular permeability. Under thiobarbiturate anesthesia, a ∼30-mm segment of the proximal duodenum with an intact blood supply was perfused in situ in rats. The effects on DBS, duodenal transepithelial net fluid flux and the blood-to-lumen clearance of 51Cr-EDTA were investigated. Perfusing the duodenum with isotonic solutions of 10% or 15% ethanol-by-volume for 30 min increased DBS in a concentration-dependent manner, while the net fluid flux did not change. Pre-treatment with the CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh172 (i.p. or i.v.) did not change the secretory response to ethanol, while removing Cl− from the luminal perfusate abolished the ethanol-induced increase in DBS. The administration of hexamethonium (i.v.) but not capsazepine significantly reduced the basal net fluid flux and the ethanol-induced increase in DBS. Perfusing the duodenum with a combination of 1.0 mM HCl and 15% ethanol induced significantly greater increases in DBS than 15% ethanol or 1.0 mM HCl alone but did not influence fluid flux. Our data demonstrate that ethanol induces increases in DBS through a mechanism that is critically dependent on luminal Cl− and partly dependent on enteric neural pathways involving nicotinic receptors. Ethanol and HCl appears to stimulate DBS via the activation of different bicarbonate transporting mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2034690521,"Background Identifying follow-up (FU) visit patterns, and exploring which factors influence them are likely to be useful in determining which patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) may become Lost to Follow-Up (LTFU). Using an operation and implementation research approach, we sought 1) to describe the timing of FU visits amongst patients who have been on ART for shorter and longer periods of time; and 2) to determine the median time to late visits, and 3) to identify specific factors that may be associated with these patterns in Zomba, Malawi. Methods and Findings Using routinely collected programme monitoring data from Zomba District, we performed descriptive analyses on all ART visits among patients who initiated ART between Jan. 1, 2007–June 30, 2010. Based on an expected FU date, each FU visit was classified as early (≥4 day before an expected FU date), on time (3 days before an expected FU date/up to 6 days after an expected FU date), or late (≥7 days after an expected FU date). In total, 7,815 patients with 76417 FU visits were included. Ninety-two percent of patients had ≥2 FU visits. At the majority of visits, patients were either on time or late. The median time to a first late visit among those with 2 or more visits was 216 days (IQR: 128–359). Various patient- and visit-level factors differed significantly across Early, On Time, and Late visit groups including ART adherence and frequency of, and type of side effects. Discussion The majority of patients do not demonstrate consistent FU visit patterns. Individuals were generally on ART for at least 6 months before experiencing their first late visit. Our findings have implications for the development of effective interventions that meet patient needs when they present early and can reduce patient losses to follow-up when they are late. In particular, time-varying visit characteristics need further research."
https://openalex.org/W2101936905,"Expression of the IL-7 receptor α-chain (CD127) is decreased on CD8 T-cells in HIV infected patients and partially recovers in those receiving antiretroviral therapy with sustained viral suppression. We have shown that soluble HIV Tat protein down regulates CD127 expression on CD8 T-cells isolated from healthy HIV-negative individuals. Tat is taken up by CD8 T-cells via endocytosis, exits the endosome and then translocates to the inner leaflet of the cell membrane where it binds to the cytoplasmic tail of CD127 inducing receptor internalization and degradation by the proteasome. This down regulation of CD127 by Tat results in impaired CD8 T-cell function. Interestingly, suppression of CD127 by Tat is reversible and requires the continual presence of Tat in the culture media. We thus questioned whether the low IL-7 receptor expression evident on CD8 T-cells in HIV+ patients was similarly reversible and if suppression of the receptor could be maintained ex vivo by Tat protein alone. We show here that when CD8 T-cells isolated from HIV+ patients are incubated alone in fresh medium, low CD127 expression on the cell surface recovers to normal levels. This recovery of CD127, however, is completely inhibited by the addition of HIV Tat protein to the culture media. This study then provides evidence that soluble factor(s) are responsible for low CD127 expression on circulating CD8 T-cells in HIV+ individuals and further implicates Tat in suppressing this receptor essential to CD8 T-cell proliferation and function."
https://openalex.org/W2081538985,"Phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) could be prevented by a silastic patch over the epicardial lead. We studied the effects in preventing PNS by placing a silastic patch directly over an epicardial lead or placing a graft around the phrenic nerve (PN).Fourteen Lanyu swine were enrolled. A bipolar lead was placed epicardially on the left ventricle (LV) inferior to the PN. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead was placed into the right ventricle (RV). The maximal influential distance (MID) was measured under 3 pacing configurations to express the influential electrical field on the PN. The threshold of the LV and PN were evaluated epicardially. Then, PTFE patches of different sizes (10×10 mm, 20×20 mm and 30×30 mm) were placed between the LV lead and PN to study the rise in PN threshold in 7 swine. On the other hand, the PN were surrounded by a PTFE graft of different lengths (10 mm, 20 mm, and 30 mm) in the remaining 7 swine. LV-bipolar pacing showed the shortest MID when compared to the other 2 unipolar pacing configurations at pacing voltage of 10 V. The patch was most effective in preventing PNS during LV-bipolar pacing. PNS was prevented under all circumstances with a larger PTFE patch (30×30 mm) or long graft (30 mm).PNS was avoided by placing a PTFE patch over the LV lead or a graft around the PN despite pacing configurations. Hence if PNS persisted during CRT implantation, a PTFE patch on the LV lead or a graft around the PN could be considered."
