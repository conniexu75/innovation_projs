However, the relationship of these pathways to one another downstream of the TGF-β receptor complex is unknown. We show that JNK is rapidly activated by TGF-β in a SMAD-independent manner and phosphorylates Smad3 outside its -SSXS motif. Smad3 phosphorylation by JNK facilitates both its activation by the TGF-β receptor complex and its nuclear accumulation. JNK regulates SMAD- and TGF-β-mediated transcriptional responses, yet JNK activators only partially stimulate transcriptional responses characteristic of TGF-β without coincident SMAD pathway activation. These results suggest an interdependent relationship between the JNK and SMAD pathways in TGF-β-mediated transcription.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). Through its effects on cell growth, differentiation, motility, adhesion, and apoptosis, TGF-β is an influential regulator of cell fate determination and tissue morphogenesis. TGF-β signals through a heteromeric receptor complex assembled in response to ligand binding and composed of type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) serine/threonine kinase receptors. Receptor activation mobilizes a complex network of signal transducers to produce pleiotropic responses. Essential elements of the post-receptor signaling machinery for TGF-β are the pathway-restricted SMADs Smad2 and Smad3 and the common-mediator Smad4. In response to TGF-β, Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated at their C termini by activated TβRI. These phosphorylated SMADs form stable complexes with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus to act as transcriptional regulators. This provides a direct conduit between the activated receptor complex and target promoters in the nucleus. Underscoring their importance in TGF-β signaling, both growth and transcriptional responses to TGF-β are abated by SMAD pathway disruption, and SMAD mutations are frequently observed in human tumors (2Massagué J.

Stimulation of AP-1-dependent transcription can be achieved by phosphorylation of the c-Jun transactivation domain by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family (13Karin M.

SMAD- and AP-1-binding elements are juxtaposed in the TGF-β-responsive regions of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter, and both have been positively implicated in PAI-1 induction by TGF-β (11Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 12Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a direct, TGF-β-inducible interaction between Smad3 and c-Jun has been recently described (4Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Given the involvement of SMAD and AP-1 function in TGF-β signaling and the regulation of both pathways by MAPKs, we examined the relationship between the SMAD and JNK signaling pathways in TGF-β-mediated transcription.We demonstrate that JNK activation in response to TGF-β is bimodal. Rapid, SMAD-independent JNK activation by TGF-β is followed by sustained, SMAD-dependent JNK activity. Both rapid and sustained JNK activation induced by TGF-β require the function of a Rho family GTPase. We also show that Smad3 is phosphorylated by JNK both in vitro and in vivo. JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3 facilitates both its phosphorylation by TβRI and its subsequent nuclear accumulation. Additionally, the JNK pathway regulates both TGF-β- and SMAD-mediated transcriptional responses, yet only modestly activates these responses in a SMAD-deficient background. These data suggest an interdependent relationship between the JNK and SMAD signaling pathways in TGF-β-mediated PAI-1 induction beyond that suggested by the juxtaposition of their response elements in the PAI-1 promoter.RESULTSGrowth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and cellular stresses can rapidly and transiently stimulate JNK activity (14Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). In contrast, JNK activation by TGF-β has been reported to be gradual and persistent, with maximum activation occurring 12 h after TGF-β treatment (19Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This timing is difficult to reconcile with the proposed involvement of JNK signaling in rapid transactivation of the PAI-1 gene by TGF-β (18Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet several reports show that components of the JNK pathway can regulate TGF-β-responsive transcriptional reporters based upon the PAI-1 promoter (19Atfi A.

Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). To address this temporal conflict, we examined JNK and ERK activation following TGF-β treatment of mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu) through a comprehensive time course using immunoprecipitation/kinase assays with GST-ATF2 and myelin basic protein as substrates, respectively (Fig. 1 A). We observed bimodal JNK activation in response to TGF-β. The primary peak of JNK activity was rapid and transient, peaking at 10 min, followed by a decline toward base-line values by 1 h. Rapid JNK activation by TGF-β was comparable to that achieved by NaAsO2 and tumor necrosis factor-α (Fig. 1 B), both common JNK activators. The primary peak of JNK activity was followed by a gradually rising, sustained secondary peak, maximal between 12 and 16 h. In contrast to JNK, ERK activation was not observed in response to TGF-β throughout the time course examined (Fig. 1 A), whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) and FBS potently activated ERK toward myelin basic protein (Fig. 1 B). These data indicate selectivity by TGF-β toward MAPK signaling pathways and are consistent with a role for JNK signaling in rapid transactivation of the PAI-1 gene.JNK activation and TGF-β signaling involve the Rho family of monomeric GTPases (19Atfi A.

To determine the role of Rho family proteins in both primary and secondary JNK activation elicited by TGF-β, FLAG-tagged JNK was transiently expressed in Mv1Lu cells with or without dominant-negative mutants of RhoA or Rac1 (RhoAN19 and Rac1N17, respectively) or C3 exotransferase. C3 exotransferase specifically inhibits Rho family proteins through ADP-ribosylation of a uniquely conserved asparagine residue (27Aktories K. Mohr C. Koch G. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 115-131PubMed Google Scholar). Following TGF-β treatment for either 10 min or 12 h, the activity of transiently expressed FLAG-JNK1 was determined in cell extracts by in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 2, A and B). We observed inhibition of JNK activity by RhoAN19 and less so by Rac1N17 after 10 min of TGF-β treatment. After 12 h of TGF-β exposure, Rac1N17 inhibited JNK activity with greater efficacy than RhoAN19. At both 10 min and 12 h following TGF-β treatment, C3 exotransferase significantly diminished FLAG-JNKwt activity. These results suggest that both RhoA and Rac1 contribute to JNK regulation by TGF-β in Mv1Lu cells.FIG. 2TGF-β activation of JNK is dependent upon Rho family GTPases and potentiates transcriptional responses. A and B, Mv1Lu cells were transiently transfected with FLAG (FL)-JNK1 either alone or in combination with inactive RhoA or Rac1 mutants or a C3 exotransferase expression plasmid (C3 exo) as shown. Following recovery, cells were maintained in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS for 24 h and then treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β for 10 min or 12 h as shown. Transiently expressed JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2, followed by in vitroJNK assay as described for Fig. 1. C, Mv1Lu cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding constitutively active (RhoQL and Rac1QL) or dominant-negative (RhoN19 and Rac1N17) RhoA and Rac1 or an inactivated mutant of JNK (FLAG-JNKAPF) as indicated, together with the 3TP-Lux reporter and an internal control β-galactosidase expression plasmid. After treatment with or without 1 ng/ml TGF-β, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. Results, normalized to the internal β-galactosidase control, reflect the means ± S.D. from a representative experiment.

Commun. 1990; 168: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To further explore the role of Rho protein-dependent JNK activity in TGF-β signaling, we tested the influence of Rho and JNK mutants on 3TP-Lux reporter activation (Fig. 2 C). Atfi et al.(19Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar)have shown varying levels of 3TP-Lux transactivation by RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in HepG2 cells. Similarly, we observed that constitutively active mutants of RhoA and Rac1 (RhoAQL and Rac1QL) potentiated 3TP-Lux transactivation by TGF-β. Conversely, dominant-negative derivatives of RhoA and Rac1 antagonized 3TP-Lux activation by TGF-β. An inactive mutant of JNK (FLAG-JNKAPF) similarly inhibited TGF-β-mediated 3TP-Lux activity. In contrast to previous results in HepG2 cells (19Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), we observed only modest activation of 3TP-Lux by constitutively active Rho proteins in Mv1Lu cells in the absence of TGF-β. This increase was blocked by coexpressed FLAG-JNKAPF, suggesting that Rho protein-dependent 3TP-Lux signaling was transmitted via the JNK pathway.Given the bimodal pattern of JNK activation by TGF-β and the modest transactivation of 3TP-Lux by upstream activators of JNK in the absence of TGF-β, we hypothesized that the primary activation of JNK by TGF-β was independent of the SMAD signaling pathway. To test the SMAD dependence of TGF-β-mediated JNK activation, we employed recombinant adenoviruses expressing TGF-β signaling components or β-galactosidase as a control (30Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gómez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). In extracts prepared from both uninfected (Ø) and β-galactosidase-expressing adenovirus (Ad: βgal)-infected Mv1Lu cells, the bimodal activation of JNK by TGF-β was maintained. Primary JNK activation in response to TGF-β was retained in cells infected with an adenovirus expressing Smad3Δ-FLAG (Ad: Smad3Δ: FL; a C-terminally truncated form of Smad3 with dominant-negative behavior), but the secondary peak was not observed. As anticipated, infection with an adenovirus expressing kinase-negative TβRII (Ad: DNIIR: FL) abolished primary JNK activation while dramatically limiting secondary JNK activity. These data suggest that primary JNK activation by TGF-β does not require the SMAD signaling pathway, but that the secondary peak is SMAD-dependent.FIG. 3Both SMAD-dependent and -independent JNK activation are observed in response to TGF-β. A, Mv1Lu cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing Smad3Δ-FLAG (Ad: Smad3Δ: FL), DNIIR-FLAG (Ad: DNIIR: FL), or β-galactosidase (Ad: βgal), followed by 24 h of incubation in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS. Uninfected (Ø) Mv1Lu cells were employed as an additional control. Cultures were then treated with TGF-β for the times indicated. JNK was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts, followed by in vitro kinase assays using GST-ATF2 as a substrate. Normal rabbit serum (N) was employed in negative control precipitations. Expression of JNK, Smad3Δ-FLAG, and DNIIR-FLAG was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-JNK or anti-flag (M2) antibodies as appropriate (data not shown). B, uninfected (Ø) MDA-MB-468 cells or those infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing Smad4-FLAG or β-galactosidase were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS for 24 h, followed by treatment with 10 ng/ml TGF-β for the times indicated. JNK activity in whole cell extracts was determined using GST-ATF2 as a substrate. Smad4-FLAG expression and equivalent JNK expression were confirmed by Western blotting with appropriate antibodies (data not shown). C, MDA-MB-468 and R1B(L17) cells were transiently transfected with expression and reporter constructs as indicated. Following treatment either with or without TGF-β, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described for Fig. 2 C.IP, immunoprecipitation; RLU, relative light units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm this hypothesis, we examined JNK activation in response to TGF-β in the breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-468 (Fig. 3 B), which harbors a homozygous deletion of theSmad4 gene, yet retains both TβRI and TβRII expression (31Schutte M. Hruban R.H. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Nadasdy G.M. Weinstein C.L. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Cairns P. Nawroz H. Sidransky D. Casero R.A. Meltzer P.S. Hahn S.A. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2527-2530PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). These cells are refractory to TGF-β in both growth and transcriptional response assays, but both responses to TGF-β are restored by Smad4 expression (Ref. 32Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar and data not shown). As predicted, primary JNK activation was observed following TGF-β treatment of either uninfected or β-galactosidase-expressing adenovirus-infected MDA-MB-468 cells. However, in neither circumstance was secondary JNK activity observed. Restoration of Smad4 expression through the use of a recombinant adenovirus (Ad: Smad4: FL) partially restored secondary JNK activity. In concert, these results suggest that the SMAD signaling pathway is dispensable for primary JNK activation by TGF-β, but is required for the secondary response. They also indicate that JNK activation by TGF-β in MDA-MB-468 cells is insufficient to induce growth arrest.In light of the SMAD independence of primary JNK activation by TGF-β, we used two strategies to elicit SMAD-independent transcriptional responses by constitutively active Rho family proteins (Fig. 3 C). In the first, we examined 3TP-Lux activation in MDA-MB-468 cells. In the second, we examined transactivation of a reporter (4XSBS) driven by the TGF-β-responsive region of the collagenase promoter, modified to contain intact AP-1 sites, but mutant SMAD-binding sites (12Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments were done in R1B cells to eliminate the potential contribution of autocrine TGF-β signaling to reporter activity. In both circumstances, reporter stimulation induced by constitutively active Rho family proteins was comparable to their induction of 3TP-Lux in Mv1Lu cells in the absence of TGF-β (Fig. 2 C). These data reinforce the SMAD independence of JNK activation in TGF-β signaling and suggest that JNK activity elicited by Rho family GTPases is insufficient to produce a robust transcriptional response characteristic of TGF-β.The pathway-restricted SMADs show multiple consensus phosphoacceptor sites for MAPK family members. The linker regions of bone morphogenetic protein-responsive Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 each contain a cluster of sites for ERK (PX(S/T)P) (33Hill C.S. Treismann R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), and ERK-mediated phosphorylation of these sites in Smad1 can inhibit bone morphogenetic protein signaling (16Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). In contrast, Smad3 is dominated by putative, non-ERK MAPK sites (XX(S/T)P) (33Hill C.S. Treismann R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). To address potential Smad3 phosphorylation by MAPKs, we performed immunoprecipitation/kinase assays as described above using His6-Smad3 (Fig. 4 A) as the substrate. Following TGF-β treatment, immunoprecipitated JNK phosphorylated His6-Smad3 in vitro. Tumor necrosis factor-α and NaAsO2 (data not shown) also stimulated JNK activity for His6-Smad3. As predicted by the data in Fig. 1 A, ERK failed to phosphorylate His6-Smad3 following TGF-β treatment (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, ERK activated by either EGF or FBS modestly phosphorylated His6-Smad3 in vitro, consistent with recently described Smad3 phosphorylation by ERK in vivo following EGF stimulation (17Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that Smad3 can serve as a direct substrate for JNK in vitro following TGF-β treatment and suggest that TGF-β-induced changes in Smad3 phosphorylation do not reflect ERK activity.FIG. 4Phosphorylation of Smad3 by JNK facilitates its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation activity in response to TGF-β in a Rho family GTPase-dependent manner. A, endogenous JNK or ERK was immunoprecipitated from extracts of Mv1Lu cells prepared following the treatments indicated. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described for Fig. 1 A using His6-Smad3 as a substrate. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized on fixed gels by autoradiography. Equal JNK and ERK expression was confirmed by Western blotting as appropriate. B, Mv1Lu cells were transiently transfected with an HA-Smad3 expression plasmid and additional expression plasmids as indicated. After recovery and brief incubation in phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.2% dialyzed FBS, cultures were maintained in labeling medium containing 750 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. HA-Smad3 was isolated by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 following 18 min of treatment with 2 nm TGF-β. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. HA-Smad3 expression was examined in parallel transfections by Western blotting (WB) with 12CA5.C, HA-Smad3 was transiently expressed in Mv1Lu cells either alone or in combination with additional expression plasmids as indicated. After 36 h, cells were replated on chamber slides and allowed to recover for 18 h. Cells were treated either without or with 10 ng/ml TGF-β for 30 min, fixed, and subjected to immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry for HA-Smad3. D, MDA-MB-468 or Mv1Lu cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression and reporter constructs. An internal control β-galactosidase expression plasmid was also included. Following treatment either without or with TGF-β, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined. NRS, normal rat serum; FL, FLAG; Vect, vector; RLU, relative light units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because primary JNK activation by TGF-β was SMAD-independent and Smad3 could be phosphorylated by JNK in vitro, we hypothesized that JNK, in addition to regulating AP-1 function, might also influence the SMAD signaling pathway directly. To address this hypothesis, we examined phosphorylation of transiently expressed, HA-tagged Smad3 in Mv1Lu cells in response to TGF-β. In the basal state, HA-Smad3 is a phosphoprotein that is further phosphorylated in response to TGF-β (Fig. 4 B). When coexpressed with FLAG-JNKAPF, both basal and TGF-β-stimulated phosphorylation of HA-Smad3 were significantly diminished. Basal phosphorylation of HA-Smad3 was potentiated by FLAG-JNKwtexpression and further increased by treatment with TGF-β. Significantly, C3 exotransferase expression abolished TGF-β-mediated HA-Smad3 phosphorylation even in the context of coexpressed FLAG-JNKwt. These data suggest that TβRI-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3 requires JNK activity, which, in turn, depends upon the function of Rho family GTPases.Phosphorylation of Smad3 by TβRI occurs on the C-terminal -SSXS motif and is necessary for its efficient nuclear translocation (34Zhang Y.

In light of the influence of JNK on Smad3 phosphorylation, we examined the influence of Rho family GTPases and JNK function on nuclear localization of transiently expressed HA-Smad3 in response to TGF-β in Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 4 C). In vector control and FLAG-JNKwt cotransfections, TGF-β induced nuclear translocation of HA-Smad3. Despite increased HA-Smad3 phosphorylation, FLAG-JNKwt expression failed to induce nuclear translocation in the absence of TGF-β. In contrast, both FLAG-JNKAPF and C3 exotransferase blocked HA-Smad3 translocation to the nucleus in response to TGF-β. To extend these observations, we also examined the effect of JNK activity on transcriptional responses mediated exclusively by SMAD signaling using the luciferase reporter CAGA12 (Fig. 4 D) (11Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). This reporter is driven by 12 concatamerized CAGA elements previously shown to bind complexes of Smad3 and Smad4 and is transactivated by both TGF-β and Smad3/Smad4 expression (Fig. 4 D). TGF-β elevated the reporter activity induced by expression of HA-Smad3 and Smad4-FLAG. In the context of HA-Smad3/Smad4-FLAG expression, FLAG-JNKwt coexpression enhanced, whereas FLAG-JNKAPF significantly reduced both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent reporter activity. Additionally, FLAG-JNKAPF significantly reduced 3TP-Lux transactivation by HA-Smad3/Smad4-FLAG expression in MDA-MB-468 cells in both the absence and presence of TGF-β. A similar result has been described by Atfi et al. (20Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using a dominant-negative mutant of MEKK1, an upstream regulator of the stress-activated kinases JNK and p38. These results suggest that Rho-dependent JNK activity contributes directly to Smad3 phosphorylation by TβRI and subsequently to SMAD-dependent transcription, distinct from its effects on AP-1.Nuclear translocation of Smad3 is facilitated by phosphorylation of the -SSXS motif by activated TβRI (2Massagué J.

However, in the context of activated MEKK1, comparable levels of phosphorylation were recently observed on wild-type Smad2 or mutant Smad2 lacking the -SSXS motif (21Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R.

However, the mechanism of inhibition is not established. These studies were carried out to test the hypothesis that Rho-kinase (Rho-associated kinase) via phosphorylation of the myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) inhibited MP activity and to identify relevant sites of phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by Rho-kinase inhibited MP activity and this reflected a decrease in V max. Activity of MP with different substrates also was inhibited by phosphorylation. Two major sites of phosphorylation on MYPT1 were Thr695 and Thr850. Various point mutations were designed for these phosphorylation sites. Following thiophosphorylation by Rho-kinase and assays of phosphatase activity it was determined that Thr695 was responsible for inhibition. A site- and phosphorylation-specific antibody was developed for the sequence flanking Thr695 and this recognized only phosphorylated Thr695 in both native and recombinant MYPT1. Using this antibody it was shown that stimulation of serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells by lysophosphatidic acid, thought to activate RhoA pathways, induced an increase in Thr695 phosphorylation on MYPT1 and this effect was blocked by a Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632. In summary, these results offer strong support for a physiological role of Rho-kinase in regulation of MP activity.

Following stimulation by several agonists an increased MLC20 phosphorylation and resultant contraction frequently occurs. Since this is effective at submaximal Ca2+ levels it is referred to as increased Ca2+ sensitivity (3Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). The extent of MLC20 phosphorylation depends on the relative activities of myosin light chain kinase (4Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and myosin phosphatase (MP) (5Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The mechanism for Ca2+ sensitization is thought to occur via inhibition of MP via a G-protein-linked pathway (3Somlyo A.P.

Physiol. 1992; 262: C405-C410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).There is strong evidence that an additional component of the Ca2+ sensitization pathway is RhoA. GTPγS induces Ca2+ sensitization in permeabilized smooth muscle fibers and this effect was blocked by ADP-ribosylation of Rho using an exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum, C3, orStaphylococcus aureus, named epidermal differentiation inhibitor (8Hirata K.

A specific inhibitor of Rho-kinase, Y-27632, also was reported to inhibit the agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle contraction (14Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar). In non-muscle cells activation of RhoA promotes the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes (15Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). C3 blocked the formation of both structures in Swiss 3T3 cells treated with the Rho-activating stimulus, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (16Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of a constitutively active form of Rho-kinase induced stress fiber and focal adhesion formation in fibroblasts and an increase in the level of MLC20 phosphorylation (17Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Natsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). These results in smooth muscle and in non-muscle cells are attributed to an increase in MLC20 phosphorylation and this is thought to reflect the inhibition of MP.MP is composed of three subunits: a catalytic subunit of type 1 phosphatase δ isoform, PP1cδ; and two non-catalytic subunits, 110 and 20 kDa. The 110-kDa subunit is a targeting molecule and thus has been termed myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1). MYPT1 is the key molecule involved in regulation of MP (for reviews, see Ref.5Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).Purified Rho-kinase thiophosphorylated MYPT1 and induced an inhibition of MP activity (18Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar, 19Feng J. Ito M. Kureishi Y. Ichikawa K.

In permeabilized smooth muscle, thiophosphorylation of MYPT1 was associated with a decreased activity of myosin phosphatase (20Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Ichikawa K. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18191-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, a potential mechanism for inhibition of MP is via the phosphorylation of MYPT1 by Rho-kinase. Phosphorylation of MYPT1 and inhibition of MP was first observed with a gizzard isoform (M133) in which the major phosphorylation site for an endogenous kinase was Thr695 (21Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Using purified Rho-kinase the inhibitory site(s) on MYPT1 was found to be in the C-terminal part of MYPT1, i.e.Ser667-Ile1004 (19Feng J. Ito M. Kureishi Y. Ichikawa K. Amano M. Isaka N. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3744-3752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Also, it is was suggested that the phosphorylation site(s) for Rho-kinase was in the sequence 753 to 1004 of gizzard MYPT1 (18Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar).In order to understand the regulation of MP it is essential to identify various functional regions of MYPT1. These include binding sites for PP1cδ and for the substrate, phosphorylated myosin, and also the inhibitory phosphorylation site(s). In the present study, we examined the effect of thiophosphorylation of MYPT1 on the enzymatic properties of MP and identified two sites, Thr695 and Thr850, on chicken MYPT1 as the major phosphorylation sites for Rho-kinase using point mutational analysis. Thr695, but not Thr850, was identified as the inhibitory phosphorylation site. Using a site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibody we found that Thr695 of MYPT1 was phosphorylated in Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated by LPA, which is known to activate Rho/Rho-kinase pathways (16Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThere is considerable evidence that Ca2+ sensitization in smooth muscle reflects inhibition of myosin phosphatase (for reviews, see Refs. 3Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar and 5Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This occurs at low, but finite, levels of Ca2+ where the activity of myosin light chain kinase does not override the phosphatase activity. However, the mechanism of MP inhibition is still not established. Initially, it was thought that the Ca2+-sensitizing effect of arachidonic acid was due to dissociation of the MP complex (37Gong M.C. Fuglsang A. Alessi D. Kobayashi S. Cohen P. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21492-21498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or, as subsequently suggested, the activation of an atypical protein kinase C isoform or an unknown kinase (38Gailly P. Gong M.C. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Other theories include: phosphorylation of MYPT1 by an endogenous kinase (21Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) or, by Rho-kinase (18Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar, 19Feng J. Ito M. Kureishi Y. Ichikawa K. Amano M.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 40Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, there is compelling evidence that RhoA is involved in Ca2+sensitization (8Hirata K. Kikuchi A. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Matsuura Y. Seki H. Saida K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8719-8722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gong M.C. Iizuka K. Nixon G. Browne J.P. Hall A. Eccleston J.F.

A. 1996; 93: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and any proposed mechanism should include consideration of this point. A logical link to RhoA is Rho-kinase (10Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 11Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T.

Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and thus an attractive hypothesis is that phosphorylation via Rho-kinase is an important component of the Ca2+-sensitization mechanism (18Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). This does not exclude other kinases/phosphatases but suggests that if such are involved they may be linked to the RhoA cascade. The data presented in this study are consistent with direct phosphorylation of MYPT1 by Rho-kinase as an inhibitory mechanism.MYPT1 is known to interact with several components and some of the regions of interaction have been identified. The N-terminal one-third of MYPT1 can bind to both PP1cδ and phosphorylated myosin and activate phosphatase activity (22Tanaka J. Ito M. Feng J. Ichikawa K. Hamaguchi T. Nakamura M. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16697-16703Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Ichikawa K. Hirano K. Ito M. Tanaka J. Nakano T. Hartshorne D.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3683-3688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The ankyrin repeats region (residues 39–295) is important in this regard, but also the N-terminal 38 residues are involved in the PP1c interaction. Residues 35 to 38, Lys-Val-Lys-Phe, and flanking charged residues form the PP1c consensus-binding motif and these are critical for the binding of PP1c (42Egloff M-P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 43Zhao S. Lee E.Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, residues 1 to 16 are thought to be involved in activation of PP1c (22Tanaka J. Ito M. Feng J. Ichikawa K. Hamaguchi T. Nakamura M. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16697-16703Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of MYPT1 contains binding sites for M20 (44Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol.

Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar), acidic phospholipids (32Ito M. Feng J. Tujino S. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Tanaka J. Ichikawa K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7607-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and myosin (45Johnson D.F. Cohen P. Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MP activity by phosphorylation of Thr695 is due mainly to a decrease inV max. If PP1c is bound to the N-terminal end of MYPT1 it is difficult to rationalize the inhibition that results from phosphorylation in the C-terminal half of the molecule. Obviously long-range effects are possible and folding of the MYPT1 molecule may facilitate interaction with PP1c. A tentative suggestion is that phosphorylation at Thr695 negates activation of PP1c by residues 1 to 16, however, this must be tested experimentally. Another point that was of interest was whether phosphorylation and inhibition of MYPT1 altered substrate specificity. Interaction of the N-terminal fragment of MYPT1 with PP1c enhances phosphatase activity toward MLC20 (see above) but suppresses activity with glycogen phosphorylase (46Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Chen Y.H. Chen M.A. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). From our results and those with moesin (47Fukata Y. Kimura K. Oshiro N. Saya H. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and adducin (48Kimura K. Fukata Y. Matsuoka T. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5542-5548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) it appears that phosphorylation of MYPT1 causes a general inhibition of phosphatase activity. The influence of the phosphorylated Thr, therefore, is suggested to be focused toward PP1c rather than at the substrate-binding regions. The phosphatase activity toward glycogen phosphorylase also was inhibited by phosphorylation. This is additional evidence that phosphorylation at Thr695 does not induce dissociation of PP1c and MYPT1. If dissociation had occurred the phosphatase activity with glycogen phosphorylase would increase.In previous studies it was reported that phosphorylation of Thr695 by an endogenous kinase caused inhibition of MP activity. This kinase was not identified but is not Rho-kinase. 2A. Murányi, M. Ito, and D. J. Hartshorne, personal communication. The above data also suggest that Thr695 is a major functional site of phosphorylation by Rho-kinase. The sequence around Thr695(numbering based on the chicken M133 isoform of MYPT1 (44Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol.

Hartshorne D.J. Kanaide H. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) MYPT1 and is 97% identical to rat MYPT1 (M110) (51Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Alessi D.J. Campbell D.G. Shanahan C. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A corresponding sequence in human MYPT2 (a separate family of MYPT and a product of a different gene (52Fujioka M. Takahashi N. Odai H. Araki S. Feng J. Nakamura M. Nakano T. Ito M. Genomics. 1998; 49: 56-59Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar)), i.e. 632 to 660, is 93% identical to M133 and contains two conservative substitutions, Ser to Thr and Lys to Arg, at positions 642 and 659, respectively. The putative phosphorylation site in MYPT2 is Thr646. The M133 sequence of Arg692 to Thr699 also is conserved in the MYPT homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans,i.e. MEL-11 (53Wissmann A. Ingles J.

The presence of this conserved sequence argues in favor of a functional role, presumably via phosphorylation, but this has not been demonstrated in MYPT2 or in the C. elegans MEL-11. The flanking sequences of Thr850 are conserved in the MYPT1 and MYPT2 (around Thr808) but not in MEL-11.The two sites identified on MYPT1 for Rho-kinase are Thr695and Thr850 and the sequences N-terminal to the phosphorylated Thr are identical, i.e. Arg-Arg-Ser-Thr. This sequence is a putative target for PKA, although Ser is preferred to Thr (54Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This probably accounts for the low extent of phosphorylation by PKA of rG-MYPT11–1004 at Thr695, although the MP holoenzyme was not phosphorylated. In addition, it was shown previously that phosphorylation of MP by PKA did not affect the phosphatase activity (32Ito M. Feng J. Tujino S. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Tanaka J. Ichikawa K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7607-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, it is proposed that the phosphorylation of Thr695 in vivo is not achieved by PKA. Protein kinase C may also be eliminated. Based on the limited evidence provided here it is suggested that the consensus sequence for Rho-kinase, and the endogenous kinase, is similar to that for PKA and requires basic residues at the −3 and −2 positions.Several earlier studies carried out under “physiological” conditions (α-toxin permeabilized smooth muscle (20Trinkle-Mulcahy L.

Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar)) had suggested a correlation between phosphorylation of MYPT1 and inhibition of MP activity, but the site(s) of phosphorylation were not identified. The only study to identify the inhibitory phosphorylation site, i.e. Thr695, was done with isolated proteins (21Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The objective of the LPA-Swiss 3T3 cell experiment was to determine if Thr695 was phosphorylated under in vivo conditions with a regime that activated RhoA. This was achieved. LPA induced about a 4-fold increase in Thr695 phosphorylation and this stimulation was blocked by a Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 (14Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar). These results add confidence to accepting the idea that Rho-kinase under physiological conditions may modify phosphatase activity via phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr695. However, there are several aspects that remain to be resolved. For example, which kinase is responsible for phosphorylation of MYPT1 in Swiss 3T3 cells in the non-stimulated state (Fig. 4) and what is the role of this phosphorylation? In addition, it was proposed that phosphorylation of MYPT1 may induce activation as well as inhibition of phosphatase activity. It was shown that MYPT1 was phosphorylated by a mitosis-specific kinase and activated MP activity (57Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hosoya H. Hartshorne D.J. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Also the activation of MP in vascular smooth muscle by elevated cGMP levels has been suggested (58Wu X. Somylo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 59Lee M.R. Li L. Kitazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5063-5068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, several features of MYPT1 and possibly MYPT2, must be considered to obtain a more complete picture of its regulation of PP1c activity.In summary, the results presented above are supportive of a physiological role for Rho-kinase in the regulation of MP activity. A direct phosphorylation of the MYPT1 subunit by Rho-kinase is indicated and the major site involved in inhibition of phosphatase activity is the Thr695. This site is located in the C-terminal one-third of the MYPT1 molecule and is separated, at least in terms of the primary structure, from the PP1c-binding sites at the N-terminal end of MYPT1. Theoretically, inhibition of PP1c activity could result from modification of PP1c or its interaction or, from changes in substrate binding. Phosphorylation of Thr695 decreaseV max, rather than changing K m and also phosphatase activities with different substrates are inhibited. Thus, it is likely that the inhibitory effect is focused on PP1c and its interactions with MYPT1. A specific antibody was developed for phospho-Thr695 and its flanking sequence and using this was demonstrated that phosphorylation of Thr695 occurred under in vivo conditions where the RhoA pathway is thought to be activated, i.e. following LPA stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells. The Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, blocked the LPA-induced phosphorylation of Thr695. It is accepted that phosphorylation of the 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC20)1 is an essential mechanism in regulating contractile activity in smooth muscle and non-muscle cells (1Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 2Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. Curr. Top.

Following stimulation by several agonists an increased MLC20 phosphorylation and resultant contraction frequently occurs. Since this is effective at submaximal Ca2+ levels it is referred to as increased Ca2+ sensitivity (3Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). The extent of MLC20 phosphorylation depends on the relative activities of myosin light chain kinase (4Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and myosin phosphatase (MP) (5Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The mechanism for Ca2+ sensitization is thought to occur via inhibition of MP via a G-protein-linked pathway (3Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 6Kitazawa T. Masuo M. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

There is strong evidence that an additional component of the Ca2+ sensitization pathway is RhoA. GTPγS induces Ca2+ sensitization in permeabilized smooth muscle fibers and this effect was blocked by ADP-ribosylation of Rho using an exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum, C3, orStaphylococcus aureus, named epidermal differentiation inhibitor (8Hirata K.

The availability of 20- and 22-carbon (n-6) and (n-3) polyenoic fatty acids is determined by the synthesis of 18:3(n-6) and 18:4(n-3) and by the subsequent elongation and desaturation of these fatty acids to 20:4(n-6) and 20:5(n-3) (20Sprecher H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The conversion of 18:2(n-6) and 18:3(n-3) to 18:3(n-6) and 18:4(n-3) is determined by the enzymatic activity of Δ-6 desaturase, whereas the rate of desaturation of 20:3(n-6) and 20:4(n-3) is determined by the activity of Δ-5 desaturase (20Sprecher H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturases are microsomal enzymes that are thought to be a component of a three-enzyme system that includes NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, cytochrome b5, and the respective desaturase (20Sprecher H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 21Strittmatter P. Spatz L. Corcoran D. Rogers M.J. Redline R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 71: 4565-4569Google Scholar). However, the recent cloning of the Δ-6 desaturase revealed that the protein contains a cytochromeb5 domain which may allow the enzyme to function independently of cytochrome b5 (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Studies based upon enzymatic activity suggest that the liver is the primary site for 20-carbon polyenoic fatty acid synthesis because the liver is the organ with the greatest amount of Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturase activity (23Scott B.L. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2903-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 24Bourre J.M. Piciotti M. Dumont O. Lipids. 1990; 25: 354-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, dietary and hormonal studies indicate that the two enzymes may be coordinately regulated (25Brenner R.R. Vergrosesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar, 26Christiansen E.N. Lund J.S. Rortveit T. Rustan A.C. Biochim.

Nervi A.M. Brenner R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, the enzymatic activity of both desaturases is reduced by diabetes, and this is associated with a reduced tissue content of 20:4(n-6) (27Poisson J.-P. Cunnane S.C. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1991; 2: 60-70Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Holman R.T. Johnson S.B. Gerrard J.M. Mauer S.M. Kupcho-Sandberg S. Brown D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similarly, the hepatic activity of both desaturases is suppressed by fasting and induced by re-feeding carbohydrate (25Brenner R.R. Vergrosesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar, 27Poisson J.-P. Cunnane S.C. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1991; 2: 60-70Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, molecular evidence for these conclusions has been lacking because the mammalian Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturases had neither been cloned nor purified. Recently, we reported the cloning and expression of the human and mouse Δ-6 desaturase ORF1 (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). More importantly, Northern analysis of human tissues challenged the concept that the liver was the primary site for Δ-6 desaturase expression (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 23Scott B.L. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence from this study indicated that a clear understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing the synthesis of biologically essential 20- and 22-carbon (n-6) and (n-3) fatty acids would require cDNAs for both desaturases. Therefore, our objective was to clone the mammalian Δ-5 desaturase and to utilize the cDNA in a comparative study of the tissue distribution and nutritional regulation of the Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturases. A BLAST search of the human genomic data base identified a gene (GenBankTM accession number AC004770) with exon sequences that displayed high homology to the nucleotide sequence of human Δ-6 desaturase (GenBankTM accession number AF126799). Using the genomic sequence, a candidate open reading frame of the putative human Δ-5 desaturase was cloned by synthesizing a forward primer containing the candidate translation start codon (5′-CGTCGCCAGGCCAGCTATGG-3′) and a reverse primer containing a possible translation stop codon (5′-TTATTGGTGAAGATAGGCATCTAGCC-3′). The primers were utilized to screen by PCR amplification a human adaptor-ligated retina cDNA library (Marathon-Ready cDNA;CLONTECH). The amplification conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s and 70 °C for 4 min and finally by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s and 68 °C for 4 min. The resulting DNA product was cloned into the cytomegalovirus promoter expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) by blunt ligation using theEcoRV restriction site. In-frame orientation was confirmed by dideoxy chain termination sequencing, and the predicted amino acid sequence of the ORF was performed using MacDNASIS pro (Hitachi). The functionality of the Δ-5 desaturase was established by stably transforming CHO cells with the human Δ-5 desaturase expression plasmid. CHO cells were cultured in Kaighn's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When the cells reached 80% confluence, they were transfected using LipofectAMINE, and Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). After the transfection period, the cells were replated, and stable transformants were selected by neomycin-resistance (500 μg/ml Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.). The functionality of the expressed peptide was examined by incubating the stably transformed CHO cells with bovine serum albumin or 200 μmalbumin-bound 20:3(n-6). To examine the possibility that the ORF encoded a Δ-6 desaturase isoform, stably transformed cells were also treated with 200 μm 18:3(n-3). To determine the endogenous Δ-5 desaturase activity, nontransformed CHO cells were treated in parallel with the same fatty acids. Both transformed and nontransformed cells were treated with the fatty acids for 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h. Expression of the peptide encoded by the ORF was ascertained by the changes in amount of fatty acid product,i.e. 20:4(n-6). Fatty acid content and composition of the CHO cells was determined by saponifying the cellular lipids, and subsequently methylating the fatty acids with boron trifluoride in methanol (Sigma) (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Methylated fatty acids were separated and quantified by gas chromatography using a fused silica glass capillary column (30 m × 0.53 mm internal diameter, Omegawax 250; Supelco) (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Heptadecanoic acid was added at the time of saponification as an internal standard. Human tissue distribution of the Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturases was determined by Northern blot analysis using a human tissue blot containing 2 μg of poly(A) RNA per lane that was purchased from CLONTECH. All tissues were histologically normal, and cause of death was generally sudden trauma. The probes for Δ-5 desaturase and Δ-6 desaturase were a 204- and a 202-bp fragment, respectively. The fragments were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP by PCR amplification using the human Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase cDNAs as templates: 5′-GAATAAAGAGCTGACAGATGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGAACTGCACTGAGCA-3′ as forward and reverse primers for the Δ-5 desaturase probe; and 5′-GGCAAGAACTCAAAGATCAC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-GAGAGGTAGCAAGAACAAAG-3′ as a reverse primer for the Δ-6 desaturase probe. The Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase probes corresponded to the sequences of 312 to 514 and 310 to 514 nucleotides downstream of the ATG for each ORF. These regions were located downstream of the cytochrome b5 domain of each protein and prior to the first histidine-rich region of each desaturase. The respective regions shared only 26% nucleotide sequence identity. The specific activity of each probe was 2.2 × 108 dpm per μg of DNA. The Northern membranes for Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase were exposed to BTOMAX MS film (Eastman Kodak) for 18 h. The impact of type of dietary fat on the hepatic expression of Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase was determined by Northern analysis using total hepatic RNA (30 μg per lane) that was extracted from male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (n = 5/group) which had been fed for 5 days a high glucose, fat-free diet supplemented with 10% (w/w) triolein (99% purity, Sigma), safflower oil (65% 18:2(n-6)), or menhaden fish oil (35% 20:5 and 22:6(n-3)) (31Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted by the phenol-guanidinium isothiocyanate method (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The probe for Δ-5 desaturase was the 202-bp human fragment described above, and the Δ-6 desaturase probe was the 167-bp fragment described previously (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase probes were 4.2 × 108 and 5.4 × 108 dpm/μg of DNA, respectively. Because of the low abundance of the Δ-5 desaturase relative to Δ-6 desaturase, the hepatic Northern blots were exposed for 40 h to BIOMAX MS film (Eastman Kodak) and 11 h for the Δ-5 desaturase and Δ-6 desaturase transcripts, respectively. As part of our efforts to identify and characterize the human genomic sequence for the recently reported Δ-6 desaturase cDNA (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), we conducted a BLAST search of the human genome. The search revealed that the 1332-bp Δ-6 desaturase ORF sequence and the entire 3′-untranslated region of the Δ-6 desaturase transcript was distributed along 12 predicted exons within a 39,000-bp region of chromosome 11 (GenBankTM accession number AC004770). Further review of the surrounding sequences within this region of chromosome 11 revealed the presence of a 14,348-bp stretch DNA that was approximately 11,000-bp downstream of the first exon that contained the initiation codon for the Δ-6 desaturase ORF. Within the 14,348-bp sequence were 12 predicted exons which appeared to contain a 1332 nucleotide ORF that was in reverse orientation to the Δ-6 desaturase ORF. The candidate desaturase ORF displayed 75% nucleotide homology with the human Δ-6 desaturase. The striking homology between the human Δ-6 desaturase sequence and the downstream desaturase sequence led us to hypothesize that the new gene may encode either a Δ-6 desaturase isoform (33Marzo I. Alava M.A. Pineiro A. Naval J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), or the human Δ-5 desaturase. Using the genomic sequence information for the putative desaturase, 1350-bp cDNA was cloned from a human retina cDNA library using PCR amplification screening. Consistent with the predicted exon sequences found in chromosome 11, sequence analysis of the cDNA obtained from PCR screening of the retina library confirmed that the apparent desaturase transcript shared 75% nucleotide homology with the human Δ-6 desaturase. An ATG translation initiation codon was identified within the cDNA; and a TAA termination codon was found 1335 nucleotides downstream of the initiation site. The size of the ORF and the 444 amino acid peptide predicted by the ORF was identical to the human Δ-6 desaturase (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, the amino acid sequence predicted by the ORF indicated that the desaturase candidate possessed 61% amino acid identity and 75% similarity to the human Δ-6 desaturase (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of the putative desaturase also revealed that the peptide contained all of the structural features that are characteristic of the human Δ-6 desaturase. For example, a hydropathy profile of the candidate desaturase revealed the presence of two membrane-spanning domains that are characteristic of membrane-anchored proteins (34Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In addition, three histidine-rich regions which may function as non-heme iron binding sites aligned almost perfectly with the same histidine-rich regions located in the Δ-6 desaturase (Fig. 1 A). Most importantly, the desaturase candidate peptide contained a cytochromeb5 domain that resided in the hydrophilic N terminus (Fig. 1 B), and this region was identical to the cytochrome b5 domain of human Δ-6 desaturase (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). It has been argued that the cytochrome b5 domain allows cytochrome b5 reductase to transfer electrons to the catalytic domain of the desaturase and thereby eliminate the need for cytochrome b5 protein per se (35Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but this conclusion remains to be demonstrated for the mammalian Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturases. Although these structural features suggested that the desaturase may be a Δ-6 desaturase isoform of the retina, the histidine-rich and cytochromeb5 domains have also been reported to be components of the Δ-5 desaturase of the fungus M. alpinaand the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (36Michaelson L.V. Lazarus C.M. Griffiths G. Napier J.A. Stobart A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19055-19059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 37Michaelson L.V. Napier J.A. Lewis M. Griffiths G. Lazarus C.M. Stobart A.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, the apparent ORF for the newly identified human desaturase possessed 54% nucleotide homology with the nucleotide sequence ofMortierella alpina and C. elegans. Thus it was possible that the desaturase candidate may in fact be the human Δ-5 desaturase rather than a Δ-6 desaturase isoform. To determine whether the newly cloned desaturase was Δ-5 or Δ-6 desaturase, CHO cells were stably transformed with an expression plasmid containing the ORF of the putative desaturase. CHO cells that had been stably transformed with the candidate desaturase ORF were incubated with the Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturase substrates, 18:3(n-3) and 20:3(n-6), respectively. Cellular fatty acid analysis revealed that the stably transformed cells did not convert 18:3(n-3) to 18:4(n-3) (data not shown), but they readily converted 20:3(n-6) to the Δ-5 desaturase product, 20:4(n-6) (Fig. 2). In fact, cells expressing the desaturase ORF converted over 12% of the 20:3(n-6) to 20:4(n-6) during the 24 h period of incubation. In contrast, the nontransformed cells displayed no increase in total cellular content of 20:4(n-6) during this same time period. In addition, CHO cells expressing the desaturase ORF displayed a 3-fold increase in the content of a very long chain polyenoic fatty acid (>20-carbons). The identity of the fatty acid has not yet been established, but its elution pattern suggests that it is an elongation product of 20:4(n-6). These functional data demonstrate that the ORF of the putative human desaturase indeed encodes the human Δ-5 desaturase. Northern analysis revealed that the human Δ-5 desaturase is a single transcript that is approximately 4.4 kb in size (Fig. 3). This is slightly bigger than the 3.4- and 3.8-kb size of the human and rat Δ-6 desaturase transcripts (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Expression of Δ-5 desaturase was greatest in the human liver (Fig. 3). Human heart, brain, and lung contained comparable levels of Δ-5 desaturase mRNA, whereas low but detectable levels of expression were found in placenta, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (Fig. 3). A search of the human expressed sequence tag data base revealed that the human Δ-5 desaturase was expressed in fetal liver, as well as the fetal spleen and heart, and in the placenta and pregnant uterus. A comparison of the relative abundance of Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase mRNA in various human tissues revealed that the level of Δ-6 desaturase mRNA in all tissues was significantly greater than the amount of Δ-5 desaturase mRNA (Fig. 3). This observation is particularly interesting because Δ-6 desaturase is often considered the enzyme which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of 20- and 22-carbon polyenoic fatty acids (20Sprecher H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 25Brenner R.R. Vergrosesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar, 27Poisson J.-P. Cunnane S.C. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1991; 2: 60-70Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Regardless of which gene has the higher level of mRNA, the observation that many tissues express detectable levels of both Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase is consistent with the importance that the desaturase pathway plays in producing 20- and 22-carbon polyenoic fatty acids (e.g. 20:4(n-6)) for membrane structure and cell signaling. In an earlier report, we noted that the hepatic abundance of Δ-6 desaturase mRNA was relatively low and well below the amount found in brain (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). This was somewhat surprising because the liver has long been considered the primary site of 20- and 22-carbon polyenoic fatty acid synthesis (23Scott B.L. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2903-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 24Bourre J.M. Piciotti M. Dumont O. Lipids. 1990; 25: 354-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Brenner R.R. Vergrosesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar). However the Northern blot of Fig. 3 reveals that the human liver may have a very high level of Δ-6 desaturase. In fact, a calculation of the relative expression of the Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturases in liver versus brain revealed that the liver contains 4–5-times more Δ-5 desaturase and 12-times more Δ-6 desaturase than does the human brain. The relative difference in human liver expression of Δ-6 desaturase between this report and our earlier work (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) may have two possible explanations. First, the RNA for the earlier Northern (22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) was prepared from a 64 year old male (Invitrogen), whereas the hepatic RNA in this report was obtained from a 35-year old male who had died of a trauma accident (CLONTECH). It is possible that aging reduces the level of hepatic expression of Δ-6 desaturase. Second and perhaps more likely is that the hepatic expression of the Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase genes is nutritionally regulated (Fig. 4; Ref. 22Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). It is very possible that the nutritional state and prior diet pattern varied between the two human donors. To resolve this conflict, the relative abundance of the Δ-6 desaturase mRNA in the brain and liver of rats fed a high glucose diet was quantified by Northern analysis, and like the 35 year old human liver (Fig. 3), rat liver contained 10-fold more Δ-6 desaturase mRNA than the rat brain (data not presented). Moreover, a 10-fold difference in mRNA content between liver and brain is consistent with the difference in Δ-6 desaturase enzymatic activity that reportedly exists between liver and brain (25Brenner R.R. Vergrosesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar). A wide array of dietary studies indicate that, when animals are fed an essential fatty acid-deficient diet, the enzymatic activity of hepatic Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase increases 3-fold (25Brenner R.R. Vergrosesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar, 28Peluffo R.O. Nervi A.M. Brenner R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, when the diet is supplemented with polyenoic fatty acids of the (n-6) and (n-3) families, these enzymatic activities are reduced (26Christiansen E.N. Lund J.S. Rortveit T. Rustan A.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1082: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Peluffo R.O. Nervi A.M. Brenner R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consistent with the enzymatic activity changes, we found that supplementing a high glucose fat-free diet with safflower oil (65% 18:2(n-6)) or fish oil (35% 20:5 and 22:6(n-3)) suppressed the hepatic abundance of Δ-5 desaturase 60% (Fig. 4). In contrast, supplementing the diet with comparable amounts of triolein (18:1(n-9)) had no suppressive effect on the expression of Δ-5 desaturase (Fig. 4). The suppression of Δ-5 desaturase expression was paralleled by a 80% reduction in the hepatic abundance of Δ-6 desaturase mRNA (Fig. 4). The reduction in hepatic abundance of Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase mRNA resulting from the ingestion of polyenoic fats is consistent with numerous reports showing that dietary polyenoic fatty acids coordinately suppress the expression of a wide array of lipogenic and glycolytic enzymes (15Clarke S.D. Baillie R. Jump D. Nakamura M.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 827: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 31Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). While the mechanism of this suppression continues to be elucidated, recent evidence suggests that (n-6) and (n-3) polyenoic fatty acids inhibit the hepatic transcription of lipogenic genes by reducing the mRNA and protein abundance of hepatic sterol response element binding protein-1 (31Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Finally, an examination of the human genome data base revealed that the Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase genes are positioned in reverse sequence orientation to each other on chromosome 11 at 11q12.2–11q13. More importantly, the distance between the exon containing the translation start site for Δ-6 desaturase is approximately 11,000 bp from the exon that contains the translation initiation codon for Δ-5 desaturase. Although the specific promoters for the two desaturases have not yet been located, the proximity of the promoters opens the possibility that transcription of the Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase genes may be coordinately governed by regulatory sequences within the 11,000-bp region that are common to both genes. One additional interesting feature of the Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturases is its location on chromosome 11. Chromosome 11 is linked to the obesity found in Pima Indians (38Hanson R.L. Ehm M.G. Pettitt D.J. Prochazka M. Thompson D.B. Timberlake D. Foroud T. Kobes S. Baier L. Burns D.K. Almasy L. Blangero J. Garvey W.T. Bennett P.H. Knowler W.C. Am. J. Hum.

In light of this linkage, it is tempting to speculate that anomalies in the expression of Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturase may play a role in the outcome or cause of the pathophysiologies associated with obesity, e.g. insulin resistance (40Pan D.A.

One is the glycosylated flavoprotein gp91Phox involved in the respiratory burst oxidase, also called “phagocyte oxidase” (for a review, see Ref. 13Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second is the p65Mox, which participates in the activity of the “mitogenic oxidase” found in vascular smooth muscle cells (14Suh Y.A.

Both require the small membrane subunit p22Phox for their activity (13Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15De Keulenaer G.W. Alexander R.W. Ushio-Fukai M.

A functional NAD(P)H oxidase, generating H2O2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner, has been solubilized by treating pig thyroid plasma membranes with detergents at a high salt concentration (16Gorin Y. Ohayon R. Carvalho D.P. Dème D. Leseney A.M. Haye B. Kaniewski J. Pommier J. Virion A. Dupuy C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The flavoprotein became unable to reduce molecular oxygen after the first step of its purification by octyl-Sepharose chromatography, suggesting that it requires one or more additional component(s) to generate H2O2 (16Gorin Y. Ohayon R. Carvalho D.P. Dème D. Leseney A.M. Haye B. Kaniewski J. Pommier J. Virion A. Dupuy C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the partially purified flavoprotein is still able to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of the electron scavengers nitroblue tetrazolium and potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6). We used this property to detect and quantify the flavoprotein activity during its purification (16Gorin Y. Ohayon R. Carvalho D.P. Dème D. Leseney A.M. Haye B. Kaniewski J. Pommier J. Virion A. Dupuy C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have now purified the thyroid oxidase flavoprotein as a first step in defining the molecular structure of the enzyme. Peptide microsequences were used to design a gene-specific primer for rapid amplification of the 3′ cDNA ends (3′-RACE). RACE by PCR provided full-length porcine and human cDNAs encoding a protein called p138Tox, which comprises 1207 (porcine) and 1210 (human) amino acids. p138Tox is similar to a predicted 1506-amino acids protein encoded by a Caenorhabditis elegans gene and with other flavoproteins involved in plant and mammalian NADPH oxidases. The p138Tox contains two Ca2+-binding motifs (EF-hand) which could be involved in the control of the thyroid NADPH oxidase by Ca2+. We also find that p138Tox is a new specific marker of thyrocyte differentiation. Finally, the gene of human p138Tox was located by FISH on chromosome 15q15. Forskolin and bovine serum albumin were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); Triton X-100 was purchased from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany); FAD-agarose and CHAPS were from Sigma; trypsin and newborn calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD); [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN (Les Ulis, France); oligonucleotides were synthesized by Eurogentec Bel SA. Human thyroid Marathon-Ready cDNAs and Advantage 2 Taq Polymerase Mix were from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from Ozyme (Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). Endoproteinase Lys-C was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Meylan, France). NADPH oxidase was solubilized from pig thyroid plasma membrane, and the flavoprotein partially purified by chromatography on octyl-Sepharose CL 4B (16Gorin Y. Ohayon R. Carvalho D.P. Dème D. Leseney A.M. Haye B. Kaniewski J. Pommier J. Virion A. Dupuy C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) except that FAD was omitted from the washing buffer containing CHAPS and from the elution buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Batches of eluted protein were stirred overnight at 4 °C with 350 μl of FAD-agarose equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.25 msucrose, 1 mm NaN3, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (buffer A). 10 mm CHAPS was then added to the suspension, which was again gently stirred overnight at 4 °C. The mix was then centrifuged (2000 × g, 30 min at 4 °C). The FAD-agarose pellet was washed twice with 3 ml of buffer B (buffer A plus 10 mmCHAPS) and once with 1.5 ml of the same buffer and suspended in SDS-gel sample buffer (1.7% final) (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). The suspension was mixed gently overnight at room temperature and centrifuged. Proteins eluted by SDS-gel sample buffer were recovered in the supernatant. Analytical SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide) was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with 0.003% Amido Black in 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid and then extensively washed in distilled water. The band of interest (3.5 μg of protein) was removed from the gel, cut into small pieces, dried under vacuum, and incubated in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.6), 0.03% SDS, 0.2 μg/ml endoproteinase Lys-C (overnight at 35 °C) for amino acid sequencing. The supernatant volume was reduced to 200 μl under vacuum and injected onto an AX300 (2.1 × 30 mm) precolumn (Perkin-Elmer) followed by a 218TP52 Vydac reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography column (2.1 × 250 mm). Peptides were eluted with a 2–35% (v/v) linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile over 90 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The major peaks were sequenced. RACE was performed using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the protocol of the supplier with 1 μg total mRNA from porcine thyrocytes that had been cultivated for 4 days with 10 μm forskolin or with human thyroid Marathon-Ready cDNAs. PCR products were cloned in pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen, Inc.) for sequencing. Sequencing was performed three times in the 5′ to 3′ direction and three times in the reverse direction. The porcine thyrocytes (2 × 106 cells/ml) were isolated by discontinuous trypsinization (18Haye B. Aublin J.L. Champion S. Lambert B. Jacquemin C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1985; 43: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and cultivated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air, water-saturated atmosphere as reconstituted follicles in suspension in 10-cm diameter untreated plastic Petri dishes (Falcon, Oxnard, CA). The cells were grown for 4 days in Eagle's minimal essential medium (pH 7.4) containing 10% (v/v) calf serum, penicillin (200 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml), with or without 10 μm forskolin. The method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar) was used to extract RNA from all cells and porcine tissues. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (20 μg) was denaturated and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. Denaturated RNAs were transferred by diffusion blotting onto a nylon membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using 20 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate). The membrane was first incubated in 0.25 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 65 °C and then was hybridized overnight at 65 °C with the heat-denatured probe cDNA. The cDNA probe was α-32P-labeled by random priming extension. The membrane was washed three times for 20 min in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and then was autoradiographed at −80 °C using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA probe used was the porcine 5′-RACE cDNA EcoR1 insert (4 kb) of pCR-XL-TOPO. The sense and antisense 5′-RACE PCR primers (Eurogentec Bel SA) were 5′-CCCACACACACTTCATCTGGCACAGCCTGC-3′ and 5′-TGGCACAGCCTCTGAGCAGTTCTTCTC-3′. The probe used to locate the p138Tox gene was the pCR-XL-TOPO vector containing the human 4-kb product of the 5′-RACE. The probe preparation and FISH conditions were essentially as described previously (20Valent A. Meddeb M. Danglot G. Duverger A. Nguyen V.C. Bernheim A. Hum. Genet. 1996; 98: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Labeled probe (40 ng) with competitor (120 ng of human placental DNA) were denatured and placed directly on the slides without incubation at 37 °C. The signal was detected as described by Valent et al. (21Valent A. Danglot G. Bernheim A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 5: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Porcine flavoproteins bound to the FAD-agarose and eluted with SDS migrated in SDS-PAGE as a single major band of apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa, and two diffuse bands with apparent molecular masses of 150 and 130 kDa (Fig. 1). Digestion of the major 180-kDa protein (see “Experimental Procedures”) with endoproteinase Lys-C generated two peptides, peptide A: AVVPPPRLYTEALQEK, and peptide B: X(V)QLIN(R/P)QDQ(T)HFVHHYEN(P), whose sequences were not found in protein data bases. Peptide B was used to design a gene-specific primer for the 3′-RACE. We carried out 5′-RACE and then amplified porcine and human full-length cDNAs by reverse transcriptase-PCR. These were cloned and sequenced. The porcine cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number AF181973) is 4996-bp long, and the human cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF181972) has 5160 bp; they are 78.1% identical (93.5% in coding region). The open reading frame (porcine: 3621 bp; human: 3630 bp) encodes a predicted protein with a theoretical molecular mass of 138 kDa. Kosak sequences (A/G)CCATGG were present at the translation start codon (porcine: CCACCATGG; human: CTACCATGG). The predicted protein, named p138Tox for “p138 thyroid-oxidase”, contains peptides A and B, confirming the cloning of the purified 180-kDa flavoprotein. Human and porcine p138Tox are 86.7% identical and contain 1210 and 1207 amino acids, respectively. p138Tox contained three main domains (Fig. 2 A). The N-terminal region had similarities to peroxidases. Residues 49–206 of the human p138Tox are 27% identical to a region of pig TPO that excludes the heme-linked proximal and distal histidines. There are four putative sites of N-glycosylation on the human p138Tox and three on the pig protein (Figs. 2 Aand 3 A), all in a predicted extracellular N-terminal domain. The difference between the 138-kDa theoretical molecular mass and the 180-kDa apparent mass of the flavoprotein could reflect the presence of complex sugars at these N-glycosylation sites. A median domain is similar to the Ca2+-binding proteins containing Ca2+ EF-hand motifs. The C-terminal domain is similar to gp91Phox and p65Mox, the large subunits of phagocyte (13Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and vascular smooth muscle cell NADPH oxidases (14Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K.

Asterisksdenote potential N-glycosylation sites of gp91Phox.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The overall sequence of p138Tox is very similar to that of a predicted protein fromC. elegans (GenBankTM accession numberAF043697). In addition to its glycosylated N terminus being similar to peroxidases, the Caenorhabditis protein has two EF-hand motifs in the middle of the primary structure (Fig. 2 A) which are conserved in p138Tox(494DKDGNGYLSFREF506 and530DLDENGFLSKDEF542 in human sequence). These Ca2+-binding sites could be involved in the direct activation of the thyroid H2O2 generator by Ca2+. The flavoprotein p138Tox is also similar to rbohA, a homolog of gp91Phox involved in the respiratory burst oxidase of Arabidopsis thaliana, which also contains two Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs in its hydrophilic N-terminal domain (22Keller T. Damude H.G. Werner D. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 255-266PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrophilicity plots obtained by the method of Kyte and Doolittle (23Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17169) Google Scholar) showed similar distributions of seven hydrophobic stretches inCaenorhabditis protein and in p138Tox, indicating that the proteins share a well conserved tertiary structure (Fig. 2 B). The first five hydrophobic stretches are probably membrane-spanning domains, according to the TMpred program (24Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar), with the glycosylated N-terminal outside the cell and the EF-hand motifs logically located inside. However, p138Tox is also a truncated mammalian version of the Caenorhabditis protein, which has an additional 331 amino acids at its N terminus.Arabidopsis rbohA has a similar, but even shorter, N terminus (Fig. 2 A), so that the first membrane-spanning domain is absent as well as the peroxidase-like glycosylated domain. The C-terminal regions of p138Tox, rbohA, and the Caenorhabditis protein are very similar to the gp91Phox and p65Mox, with a similar distribution of six hydrophobic stretches. An isoalloxazine FAD-binding motif of gp91Phox(338HPFTLTS344) is conserved in human (978–984) and porcine (975–981) p138Tox as shown (Fig. 3 B) by the multiple alignment of human and porcine p138Tox sequences with human gp91Phox sequence made with the CLUSTALW program (25Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55635) Google Scholar). The ribose (410GIGVTPF416) and adenine (534VFXCGP539) NADPH-binding motifs of gp91Phox are also found in the C-terminal region of human (1048–1054) and porcine (1045–1051) p138Tox and should lie in a cytosolic domain. The four histidine residues, which are probably involved in heme binding in gp91Phox are conserved in p138Tox. Whereas the FAD and NADPH binding sites of gp91Phox are clearly present in p138Tox, alignment of the two sequences indicates some differences. For example, the N-glycosylation sites of p65Mox and gp91Phox are absent from the p138Tox, rbohA, and Caenorhabditis protein C-terminal regions. p138Tox also differs from gp91Phox in some other sequence features, which could be relevant to the different specific mechanisms involved in their activation. Previous biochemical studies (7Nakamura Y. Ogihara S. Ohtaki S. J. Biochem. 1987; 102: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Dème D. Virion A. Aı̈t-Hammou N. Pommier J. FEBS Lett. 1985; 186: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showed that micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ were necessary and sufficient to cause complete, reversible activation of thyroid oxidase, suggesting that interaction of the flavoprotein with cytosolic factors such as p47Phoxand p67Phox is not required, unlike the respiratory burst oxidase. Indeed, three of the four motifs involved in p47Phox binding to gp91Phox subunit are not present in p138Tox (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, the tervalent arsenoxide phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a hydrophobic molecule that reacts with two vicinal thiol groups in proteins, alters the structure of the porcine thyroid oxidase so that electron transfer occurs more slowly but without Ca2+ (26Gorin Y. Leseney A.M. Ohayon R. Dupuy C. Pommier J. Virion A. Dème D. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The porcine and human p138Tox contain only two adjacent cysteinyl residues (Fig. 3 A), which are located in the first predicted membrane-spanning domain (268C and 269C), just before the intracellular segment containing the two EF-hand motifs. They are probably the binding site of PAO, reinforcing the idea that this region, absent from gp91Phox, is crucial for the control of the thyroid NAD(P)H oxidase activity by Ca2+. PAO also affects the respiratory burst oxidase, but in a different manner, because it essentially prevents the human (27Le Cabec V. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2067-2073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and bovine (28Doussière J. Poinas A. Blais C. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) oxidase activation by cytosolic factors through its binding to gp91Phox. This particular effect could result from the binding of PAO to the only two adjacent cysteinyl residues of gp91Phox, located just before the first peptide involved in activation by p47Phox(85CCSTRVRRQL94), a sequence which is absent from p138Tox (Fig. 3 B). Fig. 4 A shows that the 5-kb p138Tox mRNA was detected by Northern blot only in thyroid tissue. This strongly supports the idea that the cloned flavoprotein actually participates in the specific function of thyrocytes, the synthesis of thyroid hormones, as an essential component the H2O2 generator associated with TPO. The thyroid-specific expression of the p138 mRNA also justifies the designation of the NADPH oxidase as “thyroid oxidase” or “tox.” Fig. 4 B shows that porcine thyrocytes cultured without forskolin do not contain the 5-kb p138ToxmRNA, whereas its concentration is maintained, or even enhanced, by cyclic AMP. These data are in good agreement with those of Raspéand Dumont (10Raspé E. Dumont J.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), who reported that TSH induces H2O2 generator activity in dog thyrocytes by activating the adenylate cyclase cascade. They also corroborate our results showing that the TSH and/or forskolin stimulate NADPH oxidase activity in pig thyrocytes (11Carvalho D.P. Dupuy C. Gorin Y. Lègue O. Pommier J. Haye B. Virion A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which seems to be correlated with a higher expression of the flavoprotein (16Gorin Y. Ohayon R. Carvalho D.P. Dème D. Leseney A.M. Haye B. Kaniewski J. Pommier J. Virion A. Dupuy C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). FISH was used to locate the p138Tox gene in the human genome (Fig. 5). We analyzed 50 normal metaphases and detected no fluorescent signal in 10 metaphases because of FISH efficiency. But a fluorescent signal was observed at chromosomal band 15q15 in 40 of them. The fluorescent signal was present on only one of the two chromosomes 15 in 10% of positive metaphases, due again to the efficiency of FISH or to the detection procedure used. 15q15 is not presently considered to be a susceptibility locus for any thyroid disease. We have demonstrated that the thyroid NAD(P)H oxidase is different from other known mammalian NADPH oxidases. Its flavoprotein is not only a new homolog of gp91Phox and p65Mox, but it also has specific structural features that can account for its biochemical properties. Among them is the presence of two calcium binding EF-hand motifs, which have only been found in non-mammalian NADPH oxidases to date. Its tissue specificity and cAMP-regulated expression makes p138Tox a new marker of thyrocytes, which could be relevant in thyroid disorders. We thank Dr. J. P. Blondeau for critical reading of the manuscript and helpful discussions, Prof. B. Haye and O. Legué for kindly providing the dispersed porcine thyrocytes, and J. d'Alayer (Laboratoire de Microséquençage des protéines, Institut Pasteur) for microsequencing peptides of the porcine flavoprotein.

Transcriptional activation domains in the steroid receptors that may mediate these interactions include activation function 1 in the NH2-terminal domain and activation function 2 (AF2)1 in the ligand binding domain (LBD).

We therefore investigated the mechanism whereby AR recruits p160 coactivators and the role of AF2 in AR function. It is demonstrated that weak interactions between the AR LBD and SRC1 and TIF2 correspond with weak AR AF2 activity. The AF2 surface in the AR LBD instead functions as a strong interaction site for the AR NH2-terminal domain that is required for AR activityin vivo. SRC1 and TIF2 interact with the AR NH2-terminal and DNA binding domain (DBD) regions in an LXXLL motif-independent manner mediated by the carboxyl-terminal region of SRC1 and the carboxyl-terminal and central regions of TIF2.

The GALSRC1 constructs were prepared as follows: GALSRC1–1441 by using the pCR3.1hSRC1aBspHI(blunt)/XbaI fragment cloned into pGALO (SmaI/XbaI); GALSRC1–780 by digesting GALSRC1–1441with BamHI/XbaI and religating; GALSRC568–1441 by cloning the EcoRI(blunt)/XbaI pCR3.1hSRC1a fragment into pGALO (SalI(blunt)/XbaI); GALSRC564–800 and GALSRC564–1138 using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using 5′-NdeI and 3′-XbaI primers and the fragment cloned into pGALO (NdeI/XbaI); GALSRC568–954 by digesting GALSRC568–1441 withSacI/XbaI and religating; GALSRC1139–1441 by cloning the HindIII(blunt)/ XbaI pCR3.1hSRC1a fragment into pGALO (SalI(blunt)/XbaI); GALSRC1139–1437 by cloning the PCR-amplified fragment of pCR3.1hSRC1a using 5′-BamHI and 3′-XbaI primers into pGALO (BamHI/XbaI). VPAR (human AR residues 1–919) and VPAR1–660 (AR NH2-terminal and DBD residues 1–660) contained the VP16 transactivation domain (16Langley E. Zhou Z. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

VPSRC1 constructs were created as follows: VPSRC1–1441 by excising full-length SRC1a from pCR3.1hSRC1a using BspHI (blunt)/XbaI and cloned into pNLVP16 (XhoI(blunt)/XbaI); VPSRC568–1441 by cloning the EcoRI(blunt)/XbaI pCR3.1hSRC1a fragment into pNLVP16 (SalI(blunt)/XbaI).

Single base mutations in the AR LBD were created by PCR mutagenesis, and all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The NH2-terminal and carboxyl-terminal (N/C) interaction assay between the AR NH2- and carboxyl-terminal regions was determined using GALAR624–919, a fusion protein with Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 DBD residues 1–147 and AR LBD residues 624–919 in pGALO (16Langley E.

Activity was determined as indicated or in the presence or absence of 1 μm dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Fold induction relative to the no hormone control is indicated above the bars. For interactions between TIF2 and SRC1, GALAR624–919 was cotransfected with VPTIF2 or VPSRC1 fusion constructs in the CHO two hybrid assay. VPAR and VPAR1–660 were expressed with GALTIF2 or GALSRC1 mutants containing the GAL4 DBD. Control interactions were with pNLVP16 (VP16). GST fusion proteins were expressed in XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells treated with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h after log phase growth. Bacteria were sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads are washed five times with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with and without 0.2 μm DHT, andin vitro translated proteins were labeled with 25 μCi of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) using the TNT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence and absence of 0.2 μm DHT. Beads were centrifuged, washed five times, and boiled in SDS. Input lanes contain approximately 20% that used for the binding reactions. GSTAR1–660 was prepared by excising AR1–660 coding for AR NH2-terminal and DBD residues 1–660 from GALAR usingTthIII(blunt)/BamHI and cloned into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at SmaI/BamHI. GSTTIF2M (TIF2 624–1141) and GSTTIF2C (TIF2 1144–1464) were PCR amplified, and fragments were cloned in pGEX-2T (EcoRI/BamHI). TIF2 carboxyl-terminal residues 1143–1464 were amplified from pSG5TIF2 by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3HA (provided by Yue Xiong) at theBamHI/XbaI sites to prepare35S-labeled TIF2-C. pGEMhAR (provided by Jiann-an Tan and Frank S. French) coded for full-length human AR residues 1–919 and was used to prepare 35S-AR. GSTAR1–565 was prepared by digesting GALAR1–919 with HindIII(blunt)/BamHI and cloned into pGEX-3X at EcoRI(blunt)/BamHI. pcDNA3HA-AR-LBD expressing the human AR LBD residues 624–919 was digested from GALAR624–919 with BamHI/XbaI and cloned in the same sites in pcDNA3HA for in vitrotranslation. Expression of the AR DBD and LBD fragment AR507–919 (Fig. 1 A) or AR LBD residues 624–919 fused with the GAL4 DBD (GALAR624–919, Fig. 1 B) shows little or no induction of transcriptional activity indicating the absence of AF2 activity. In contrast, agonist-dependent AF2 activity of the GAL4-glucocorticoid or estrogen receptors LBD fusion proteins were 16 ± 6-fold and 3.6 ± 0.3-fold (Fig. 1 B). Lack of AF2 activity by the AR LBD might result from failure to recruit p160 coactivators. Moreover, in transient cotransfection assays, expression of SRC1 or TIF2 increased full-length AR transcriptional activity about 3–6-fold, which surprisingly was only partially diminished by mutation of the three LXXLL motifs in TIF2 (TIF2 m123, Fig. 1 A) and SRC1 (21Parker M.G. Bevan C. Cowley S. Heery D. Kalkhoven E. Mak H.Y. Needham M. Valentine J. White R. Proceedings, The Steroid Receptor Superfamily, Indian Wells, CA, January 8–12, 1999. American Association for Cancer Research, Philadelphia, PA1999Google Scholar), suggesting that p160 coactivators can increase AR transactivation in an LXXLL motif-independent manner. We therefore investigated the interaction of AR with SRC1 and TIF2. Of several fragments tested in a mammalian two hybrid assay, only TIF624–1287 and SRC568–1441 each with three (3Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and four LXXLL motifs, respectively, interacted 2–3-fold with the AR LBD (GAL-AR624–919, Fig. 2), which was less than 10% the activity observed in the N/C interaction (see below and Fig. 4 A), suggesting weak coactivator binding affinity compared with the interaction between the NH2- and carboxyl-terminal AR domains. Although results are shown at saturating DHT concentrations (1 μm, Fig. 2, Table I), interactions between the p160 coactivators and the AR LBD in the two hybrid assay were detected at 0.01 nm DHT. The LBD regions of the glucocorticoid (486–778) and estrogen (250–595) receptors interacted with these fragments 69 ± 4-fold and 5.9 ± 1.2-fold, and 7.5 ± 1.7 and 8.2 ± 1.7, respectively (data not shown). However, overexpressed TIF2, but not a mutant with three mutated LXXLL motifs, increased activation by the AR LBD (AR507–919, Fig. 1 A), indicating that exogenously expressed coactivators can rescue LXXLL motif-dependent AF2 activity in the AR LBD, which as shown below was blocked by site-directed mutations in AF2 (see Fig. 4 B). The results suggest that the apparent lack of AR AF2 activity results from inefficient LXXLL motif-dependent recruitment of endogenous coactivators. Recovery of AF2 by overexpression of p160 coactivators suggests overall retention of nuclear receptor AF2 structure (6Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D.

A 2–5-fold interaction between TIF624–1179 or TIF1288–1464 with full-length AR (VPAR, Fig. 2 A) or the constitutively active NH2-terminal and DBD fragment AR1–660 (VPAR1–660, Fig. 2 A) indicates interaction of AR with two regions of TIF2. This interaction increases to 7–14-fold by including the TIF2 glutamine-rich region in TIF624–1287 and TIF1143–1464 (Fig. 2 A). The results of GST adsorption assays confirm that both the central and carboxyl-terminal domains of TIF2 interact with the AR NH2-terminal and DBD fragment (Fig. 3 A). Deletion mapping of SRC1 indicates that mainly its carboxyl-terminal region interacts with AR or the AR NH2-terminal fragment, and deletion of the SRC1 carboxyl-terminal LXXLL motif did not diminish this interaction (Fig. 2 B). Deletions of AR NH2-terminal residues 339–499, but not Δ14–150 or Δ142–337, decreased the SRC1 interaction by 50% suggesting this region of the NH2 terminus contributes to the LXXLL-independent interaction with TIF2 and SRC1 (data not shown). We concluded that AR can recruit p160 coactivators through its NH2-terminal and DBD regions independent of the LXXLL motifs by interacting with the carboxyl-terminal region of SRC1 or the carboxyl and central regions of TIF2. Whereas the role of nuclear receptor NH2-terminal domains in recruiting 160 coactivators has been controversial (4Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Edwards D.P.

The function of the AF2 region in AR-mediated gene activation was further investigated by site-directed mutagenesis.

Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Sites for mutagenesis were based on an association with the androgen insensitivity syndrome and with retention of high affinity androgen binding (Table I). All of the AR LBD mutants expressed at similar levels based on binding capacity and retained high affinity binding of the synthetic androgen [3H]R1881 (K d 0.3–0.7 nm) (Table I) indicating conservation of the ligand binding pocket. However, mutations at V889M, Y739A, W741A, E897K, I898T, and V716R increased the dissociation rate of androgen bound to full-length AR by 2–5-fold (Table I) suggesting an increased association rate and perturbation of the hormone binding region. V889M lies between helices 11 and 12 and causes nearly complete androgen insensitivity (32De Bellis A. Quigley C.A. Marschke K.B. El-Awady M.K. Lane M.V. Smith E.P. Sar M. Wilson E.M. French F.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), increases the androgen dissociation rate (33Zhou Z.X. Lane M.V. Kemppainen J.A. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and interferes with the androgen-dependent interaction between the AR NH2- and carboxyl-terminal regions (16Langley E. Zhou Z. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 20Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The N/C interaction facilitates AR transcriptional activity at physiological androgen concentrations (34Kemppainen J.A. Langley E. Wong C.I. Bobseine K. Kelce W.R. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 440-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) but, unlike peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (35Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), is not required for high affinity androgen binding (16Langley E. Zhou Z. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). When expressed in full-length AR, all AF2/signature sequence mutants, with the exception of K720A (see below), required 100–1000-fold higher DHT concentrations to activate an androgen responsive reporter (Table I) indicating greatly reduced function by the mutant ARs. Almost all of the AF2/signature mutants had reduced to undetectable interaction with TIF2 (Table I), SRC1 (data not shown), and the AR NH2-terminal domain (Table I), whereas most mutants outside this region had wild-type activity. Transcriptional activity at 0.1–1 nm DHT in the absence of an N/C interaction for V716R and E897K (Table I) shows that AR function can be compensated in vitro by elevated androgen levels (34Kemppainen J.A. Langley E. Wong C.I. Bobseine K. Kelce W.R. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 440-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), whereas in vivo, decreased N/C interaction is associated with partial (I737T, F725L) or complete (I898T, V889M) androgen insensitivity (Fig. 4 A). Transcriptional activity of the AR DBD/LBD fragment AR507–919 coexpressed with TIF2 or with the AR NH2-terminal fragment AR1–503 lacking the AR DBD was also decreased by several of the mutations (Fig. 4 B, Table I). Thus many of the same residues in the AF2/signature sequence serve as both a weak binding site for p160 coactivators and for the AR NH2-terminal domain. However, the binding sites are not identical, because AR mutant I898T greatly decreased the N/C interaction but retained strong p160 coactivator binding, and K720A retained the N/C interaction but essentially lost p160 coactivator binding (Fig. 4, A and B). The functional significance of the AR AF2 region was therefore distinguished by these mutations, K720A and I898T. Lys-720 lies within helix 3 of the AF2 hydrophobic surface in a region highly conserved among nuclear receptors. Lys-720 corresponds to Lys-366 in mouse estrogen receptor, whose mutation eliminates estrogen receptor transcriptional activity (22Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and to Lys-301 in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, where it forms part of an LXXLL motif charge clamp (9Nolte R.T. Wisely B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). K720A retains the transcriptional activity of wild-type AR (Table I) (36Alen P. Claessens F. Schoenmakers E. Swinnen J.V. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), even though the p160 coactivator binding by the LBD is low to undetectable (Fig. 4,A and B, Table I). Retention of wild-type AR transcriptional activity by K720A correlates with the 21-fold N/C interaction (Fig. 4 A), but not with the LXXLL motif-dependent p160 coactivator recruitment by the AR LBD (Fig. 4, A and B). An AR somatic mutation at this same site (K720E) in a bone metastases of hormone refractory prostate cancer also retained a normal transcriptional response (37Kleinerman D.I. Troncoso P. Pisters L.L.

A mutation at the corresponding Lys-366 in the estrogen receptor distinguished the binding of SRC1 and RIP140, coactivators that interact through LXXLL motifs at the same hydrophobic cleft (22Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting this residue contributes to multiple overlapping interaction sites. I898T, on the other hand, retains strong coactivator binding to AF2 but has a greatly reduced N/C interaction (Fig. 4, A andB) and is associated with complete androgen insensitivity (Table I). Thus a decline in the N/C interaction at AF2, but to a much less extent coactivator interaction at AF2, is associated with androgen insensitivity and thus loss of AR function in vivo. Although p160 coactivators may contribute to the N/C interaction (4Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

The data predict that AF2 mutations that disrupt p160 coactivator binding alter male phenotypic expression only if they interfere with the overlapping N/C interaction site. Most AF2 and signature sequence mutations that increase the androgen dissociation rate and cause severe androgen insensitivity (Table I) (43Hiort O. Sinnecker G.H. Holterhus P.M. Nitsche E.M. Kruse K. J. Pediatr. 1998; 132: 939-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) are associated with helix 12 (29Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Androgen dissociation rates from the DBD/LBD AR507–919 fragment increased 7-fold fromt 12 44 min to t 123–8 min at 37 °C by W741A, I898T, Y739A, and V889M (Table I). Trp-741 in helix 5 is predicted to contact Ile-898 in helix 12, Tyr-739 in helix 4 contacts Val-911 in helix 12, and Val-889 lies between helices 11 and 12 (Fig. 5). Trp-741 corresponds to Trp-755 in the progesterone receptor, which directly interacts with bound agonist (29Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), so a mutation at this site could directly increase the ligand dissociation rate. On the other hand, I737T in helix 4 and F725L between helices 3 and 4 cause only partial androgen insensitivity (44Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. El-Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are not predicted to contact helix 12. Nor do they influence the androgen dissociation rate or completely disrupt the N/C interaction (Table I). These and other mutations not associated with helix 12 (V716R, K720A, Q867H/P868D) retained the wild-type androgen dissociation rate. Thus helix 12 appears to stabilize androgen in the binding pocket. The N/C interaction appears to further stabilize helix 12 and bound androgen. As we showed previously, deletion of the NH2-terminal domain increases the androgen dissociation rate by 4–5-fold (20Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 33Zhou Z.X. Lane M.V. Kemppainen J.A. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, E897K in helix 12 eliminates the N/C interaction and increases the androgen dissociation rate 2-fold (Table I). Glu-897 is equivalent to Glu-471 in helix 12 in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, which forms part of the LXXLL charge clamp of AF2 (9Nolte R.T. Wisely B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar), supporting overlapping coactivator and AR NH2-terminal binding sites. V716R, though not positioned near helix 12, eliminates the N/C interaction, and the androgen dissociation rate increased 5-fold (Table I). Mutations at Gln-867 and Pro-868 in the loop between helices 10–11 to the conserved residues HD of the progesterone and estrogen receptors (Q867H/P868D, Table I), where Gln-867 juxtaposes Tyr-915 in helix 12, increased the N/C interaction 2-fold (data not shown) and slowed the androgen dissociation rate to a similar extent (Table I). Thus the N/C interaction and the AF2/signature sequence residues appear to contribute to the positioning of helix 12, which results in slowing the dissociation rate of bound androgen. SRC1 slowed estrogen receptor ligand dissociation (45Gee A.C. Carlson K.E. Martini P.G.V. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1912-1923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, overexpression of TIF2 had no effect on androgen dissociation from full-length AR (data not shown). The data are consistent with overlapping LBD AF2 binding sites for TIF2 and the AR NH2-terminal domain, which in the presence of androgen agonist participates in the N/C interaction. For the AR, p160 coactivator recruitment appears to be mediated primarily by the AR NH2-terminal and DBD regions. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the data suggest that AF2 in the AR LBD serves predominantly as an N/C interaction site, which upon agonist binding contributes to stabilization of helix 12 to slow androgen dissociation necessary for AR functional activity at physiological androgen concentrations.

In addition to the bis-thiazole moiety, myxothiazol has some unique features: the unusual leucine derived starter unit 3-methyl-butyryl-CoA (13Trowitzsch-Kienast W. Wray V. Gerth K. Reichenbach H. Höfle G. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1986; : 93-98Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the linear polyketide backbone, which includes a β-methoxy-acrylate and a terminal amide structure. Little is known about the biochemistry of the formation of myxobacterial compounds and their corresponding gene clusters. A PKS gene (23Schupp T. Toupet C. Cluzel B. Neff S. Hill S. Beck J.J. Ligon J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3673-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and a NRPS gene (24Pospiech A. Cluzel B. Bietenhader J. Schupp T. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) from myxobacteria were detected by hybridization studies using heterologous gene probes or by Tn5 mutagenesis. Fragments of these genes have been cloned and sequenced. In contrast a great variety of PKS and NRPS genes from Actinomycetes and fungi have been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites (for a review, see Ref. 25). We have established a method for cloning myxobacterial PKS and NRPS genes. Using this approach, both the stigmatellin- and the myxalamid biosynthetic gene clusters of S. aurantiaca Sg a15 were identified (22Beyer S. Kunze B. Silakowski B. Müller R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The frequent occurrence of secondary metabolites in myxobacteria that seem to be synthesized by a combined PKS/NRPS is remarkable (e.g.myxothiazol, epothilones, myxalamids; compare Fig. 1). With probes for PKS and NRPS genes, we detected DNA fragments hybridizing with both gene types in a cosmid library of S. cellulosum So ce90 (22Beyer S. Kunze B. Silakowski B. Müller R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that produces epothilones. In addition one ORF showing homology to PKS and NRPS involved in the biosynthesis of myxovirescin has been reported recently (21Paitan Y. Alon G. Orr E. Ron E.Z. Rosenberg E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This report deals with the isolation and characterization of a gene cluster from S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 that is involved in myxothiazol biosynthesis. It comprises genes encoding PKSs and NRPSs, inactivation of which impairs myxothiazol biosynthesis. In close proximity to this cluster is located mtaA, which encodes a putative Ppant transferase. The gene product is shown by insertional mutagenesis to be necessary for myxothiazol formation. MtaA presumably catalyzes the transformation of the apo- to theholo-form of the combined myxothiazol-PKS/NRPS. The presence of genes of the Ppant transferase family in the neighborhood of PKS or NRPS genes has been observed in other bacteria (26Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M.

As cell mass and adsorber resin contained secondary metabolites after the fermentation, secondary metabolites were extracted from both together twice with acetone. The spectrum of secondary metabolites produced was determined in aliquots of concentrated acetone extracts by diode-array-detection HPLC analysis using a Hewlett Packard 1090 series II instrument. The conditions for the chromatography of the extract from wild type and mutant BS57 were: column ET 125 × 2 mm and precolumn, Nucleosil 120-3 C18; solvent: 0.2% acetic acid (A)/acetonitrile (B) gradient, 50% B at 5 min to 80% B at 15 min; flow rate 0.5 ml/min; detection range 200–400 nm. For extracts from mutant BS47 in comparison to wild type growth, sample preparation and analysis was performed as described above except for the usage of Nucleosil 120-5 HPLC columns. Chromosomal DNA from S. aurantiaca was prepared as described (31Neumann B. Pospiech A. Schairer H.U. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 332-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Southern analysis of genomic DNA was performed using the standard protocol for homologous probes of the DIG DNA labeling and detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR was carried out usingTaq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 5% Me2SO was added to the mixture. Conditions for amplification with the Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient were as follows: denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C and extension for 45 s at 72 °C; 30 cycles and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Primers used for screening the cosmid library were: SEQBS24–4, 5′- GTACGTCGCGTCACCCTCCAG-3′; SEQBS24–23, 5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCTTCTGCCAT-3′; SEQSKAF-4, 5′-GCTCCATGTTGGCTCGGTG-3′; SEQSKAF-5, 5′-CCACCTCGGCGCCAGACAAACCC-3′. For double-stranded sequencing of the pBS23 and pBS24 inserts, a dye terminator kit (PE Biosystems) and an ABI Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) were used. pSK4 and pSK9 were sequenced using the T7 polymerase sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The inserts of pBS23, pSK4, and pSK9 were sequenced by primer walking. The insert of pBS24 was restricted by AluI, HpaII, andSau3A, respectively. The AluI, HpaII, and Sau3A fragments were cloned into the SmaI,ClaI, and BamHI sites of pBCSK(−). The resulting subclones were sequenced using universal primers. Sequence gaps were closed by primer walking. The region between E25 and E201 was sequenced using primer walking from plasmid pESW8. Sequencing of cosmids E25 and E201 was performed by a shotgun approach as follows; sheared fragments of the two cosmids were subcloned separately into pTZ18R. At least 500 clones were selected from each cosmid library, plasmid DNA prepared (Qiagen) and sequenced using Big Dye RR terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Biosystems) and UPO/RPO-primer (MWG-BioTech). The gels were run on ABI 377 Sequencers, and data were assembled and edited using the XGAP program (32Bonfield J.K. Smith K. Staden R.

For colony hybridization of S. aurantiaca strains, 5 μl of cell suspension (1 × 108 cells/ml) was spotted onto a nylon membrane (Biodyne B, Pall). The membrane was incubated for 5 min on blotting paper prewetted with 0.5 m NaOH,1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 1.5m NaCl, 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, respectively. After drying for 15 min, the filters were UV-cross-linked using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Bacterial debris was removed with tissue prewetted with 60 °C prewarmed prehybridization solution. After a short incubation in 2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate), prehybridization was carried out for 2 h at 60 °C in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 50 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed overnight at 60 °C after addition of the DNA probes, which were 32P-labeled with a nick translation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The filters were washed in 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS twice for 30 min at 60 °C. The cosmid library was made as described for S. aurantiaca Sg a15 (22Beyer S. Kunze B. Silakowski B. Müller R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Approximately 1800 cosmid-harboring single colonies were picked into 96-well microtiter plates, grown in LB medium overnight, and replicated. To one copy of the library, 25% glycerol was added and the plates were frozen at −80 °C. Cell mass of 16 clones of each plate of the second copy was pooled, and a cosmid preparation of each pool performed. These “cosmid pools” were used as templates in PCR reactions with primer pair SEQBS24–4 and SEQBS24–23 specifically binding to the insert of pBS24. Pools giving a PCR product of the expected size (821 bp) were used as templates in a second round of PCR reactions employing primers SEQSKAF-4 and SEQSKAF-5, which bind to the insert of pBS23. Only pools not giving the PCR product of the expected size for the latter primer pair (768 bp) were further analyzed. The corresponding clones were picked from the first copy of the library and the cosmids were independently isolated. Analogous PCR reactions with single cosmids revealed that the first primer pair binds to the insert of cosmid E25, whereas the second pair does not. For characterization of mtaA, insertional mutant BS57 was constructed. Plasmid pSKAF that was obtained by inserting anEcoRI fragment which encoded fbfA,fbfB, mtaA, and part of mtaB into pBSSK(−) was restricted by FseI. After removing the extending 3′ends by T4 DNA polymerase, the kanamycin resistance gene (neo) was inserted, which was obtained from pUC4KIXX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after restriction with SmaI. The plasmid obtained, pBS31, contained the neo gene in the divergent orientation of the mtaA gene. pBS31 was linearized with ScaI and transferred into S. aurantiacaDW4/3-1 wild type by electroporation (22Beyer S. Kunze B. Silakowski B. Müller R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

In the kanamycin-resistant recombinant BS57, the wild type gene was replaced by the mutant mtaA gene, into which the neo gene was inserted (compare Figs. 2 and 3).FIG. 3Genotypes of S. aurantiacaDW4/3-1 and mutants BS47 and BS57.

(S/X) indicates the SalI restriction site, which was lost during construction of mutant BS47 (for the construction of the mutant strains, compare “Materials and Methods”). Southern analysis of chromosomal DNA restricted withEcoRI/SalI of S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 (lanes 1 and 3), mutant BS57 (lane 2), and mutant BS47 (lane 4) simultaneously hybridized with inserts of pBS23 and pSK4 (see Table I). The insert of pSK4 covers mtaA and hybridizes with the 5.1-kbp EcoRI/SalI fragment. The insert of pBS23 represents the SalI/SalI fragment replaced by the neo gene in BS47. Fragment sizes are estimated using DNA Molecular Weight Marker III, DIG labeled (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The 12-kbp EcoRI fragment of pSKAF was cloned into pBCSKSalIΔ (constructed via restriction of pBCSK(−) withSalI, fill-in using the Klenow fragment of the DNA polymerase, and religation resulting in loss of the SalI restriction site in pBCSK(−)) precut with EcoRI, resulting in plasmid pBS26. After SalI restriction of pBS26, a 2.3-kbpSalI-SalI fragment was replaced by theneo gene from pUC4KIXX, resulting in plasmid pBS27. By electroporation pBS27 was introduced into S. aurantiacastrain DW4/3-1. The resulting electroporants were screened by colony hybridization using pBCSK(−) and the neo gene (derived from pUC4KIXX) as probe, respectively. BS47 (pBCSK(−)-negative andneo-positive) was chosen for further analysis (compare Figs. 2 and 3). Sequence analysis of the chromosomal regions adjacent to the S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 developmental genes fbfA and fbfB (28Silakowski B. Pospiech A. Neumann B. Schairer H.U. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Silakowski B. Ehret H. Schairer H.U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) led to the detection of a 834- bp open reading frame (ORF) designated mtaA(myxothiazol). The start codon ofmtaA is located about 800 bp downstream of thefbfB stop codon (see Figs. 2and 3). The codon bias is in accordance with other genes from myxobacteria (66.1/50.7/79% G+C in the first, second, and third position, respectively; see Table II) (35Shimkets L. Dworkin M. Kaiser D. Myxobacteria II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 85-108Google Scholar). Sequence alignments reveal that mtaA encodes a predicted polypeptide with significant homology to Ppant transferases (26Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M.

AcpS is the first cloned and characterized Ppant transferase that catalyzes the conversion of the inactive apo form of the fatty acid synthase to the functional form of the enzyme. EntD and Sfp were originally reported to be specific for the activation of the enterobactin- and the surfactin synthetase, respectively. Recently, it was reported that by coexpression Sfp is able to activate fragments of the erythromycin PKS expressed in E. coli (37Gokhale R.S. Tsuji S.Y. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Science. 1999; 284: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Inactivation of mtaA by insertional mutagenesis (compare Fig. 3) resulted in mutant BS57, which is impaired in myxothiazol formation. Mutant BS57 was analyzed for secondary metabolite production by diode-array coupled HPLC and HPLC-MS and did not form any detectable amount of myxothiazol (see Fig. 5; HPLC-MS data not shown). In addition at least one other yet unidentified substance could not be detected in the mutant.Table IIDeduced functions of ORFs in the myxothiazol biosynthetic gene clusterPolypeptide (modules)Amino acidsGC bias: (first, second, third position)Proposed functionMtaA27766.1 /50.7 /79.0Ppant transferaseMtaB loading +400372.9 /51.3 /77.3PKS domains:Module 1ACP, KS, AT, AT, DH, ER, KR, ACPModule 2KS, AT, DH, KR, ACPMtaC129070.7 /47.1 /81.2NRPS domains:Module 1Heterocyclization, adenylation, PCPMtaD329168.1 /46.1 /82.2NRPS + PKS domains:Module 1Heterocyclization, adenylation, PCPModule 2KS, AT, DH, KR, ACPMtaE194769.9 /47.8 /85.3PKS domains:Module 1KS, AT, O-MT, KR, ACPMtaF136066.0 /42.4 /88.1PKS domains:Module 1KS, AT, O-MT, ACPMtaG175070.1 /45.5 /84.5NRPS domains:Module 1Condensation, adenylation A1–A4, MonoOx, adenylation A5–A10, PCP, TE Open table in a new tab FIG. 5Comparison of the HPLC analysis of the secondary metabolites of the S. aurantiaca wild-type strain DW4/3-1, the mtaB mutant BS47, and themtaA mutant BS57. M, myxothiazol.Inset, UV-absorption spectrum of myxothiazol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) About 450 bp downstream of mtaA, a large open reading frame (ORF) was detected and designated mtaB. It encodes a gene product with significant similarity to PKSs. The gene begins with an ATG start codon, which is preceded by a putative ribosome binding site (AGGA), and the codon bias is in accordance with other myxobacterial genes like mtaA (72/52/77). Replacing an internal 2.3-kbp SalI-SalI fragment with the Tn5-derived kanamycin resistance cassette as illustrated in Fig. 3inactivated the gene and resulted in strain BS47. Mutant BS47 was analyzed for secondary metabolite production by diode-array coupled HPLC and HPLC-MS. BS47 did not form a detectable amount of myxothiazol but still produced the unknown compound missing in BS57 (see Fig. 5; HPLC-MS data not shown). Since only part of the PKS was encoded by plasmid pSKAF, a cosmid library of S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 was constructed and screened as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cosmid E25 was mapped and subcloned (see Fig. 2). A 7.3-kilobase pairHindIII/BglII fragment located at the end of E25 was cloned from genomic DNA of S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 (pESW8) and used as a probe to isolate cosmid E201, which shares with E25 the sequence of the last SauIIIA restriction site. Cosmids E25 and E201 were shown to be colinear with genomic DNA of S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1 by Southern analysis (data not shown). Partial sequences of the inserts of plasmids pE25–11, pE25–5.5, and pE25–2 (see Table I) were determined. They showed significant homology to PKSs and NRPSs. Subsequently, cosmid E25 and part of E201 were sequenced. Six large ORFs designatedmtaB-mtaG were detected (see Fig. 2). The overall G+C content of the sequenced mta region is 65.9%.

https://openalex.org/W2052972580,"Human collagenase-3 (matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13)) is characterized by exceptionally wide substrate specificity and restricted tissue specific expression. Human skin fibroblasts in culture express MMP-13 only when they are in three-dimensional collagen (Ravanti, L., Heino, J., López-Otı́n, C., and Kähäri. V.-M. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 2446–2455). Here we show that MMP-13 is expressed by fibroblasts during normal human gingival wound repair. Expression of MMP-13 by human gingival fibroblasts cultured in monolayer or in collagen gel was induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Treatment of gingival fibroblasts with TGF-β1 activated two distinct mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in 15 min and p38 MAPK in 1 and 2 h. Induction of MMP-13 expression by TGF-β1 was blocked by SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, but not by PD98059, a selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation. Adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant negative p38α and c-Jun potently inhibited induction of MMP-13 expression in gingival fibroblasts by TGF-β1. Infection of gingival fibroblasts with adenovirus for constitutively active MEK1 resulted in activation of ERK1/2 and JNK1 and up-regulation of collagenase-1 (MMP-1) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) production but did not induce MMP-13 expression. In addition, activation of p38 MAPK by constitutively active MKK6b or MKK3b was not sufficient to induce MMP-13 expression. These results show that TGF-β-elicited induction of MMP-13 expression by gingival fibroblasts is dependent on the activity of p38 MAPK and the presence of functional AP-1 dimers. These observations demonstrate a fundamental difference in the regulation of collagenolytic capacity between gingival and dermal fibroblasts and suggest a role for MMP-13 in rapid turnover of collagenous matrix during repair of gingival wounds, which heal with minimal scarring. Human collagenase-3 (matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13)) is characterized by exceptionally wide substrate specificity and restricted tissue specific expression.

On the other hand, excessive breakdown of connective tissue components plays an important role in destruction of functional tissue architecture, e.g.in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, periodontitis, autoimmune blistering disorders of skin, and dermal photoaging as well as in invasion and metastasis of tumor cells (see Refs. 1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of structurally related zinc-dependent endopeptidases collectively capable of degrading essentially all ECM components, and they are implicated in ECM remodeling in the physiologic and pathologic situations mentioned above. At present, 18 human members of the MMP family have been characterized, and most of them can be divided into subgroups of collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, and membrane-type MMPs based on their substrate specificity and structure (1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Collagenase-1 (MMP-1), collagenase-2 (MMP-8), and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) are the principal neutral proteinases capable of degrading native fibrillar collagens in the extracellular space. They all cleave type I, II, and III collagens at a specific site, generating ¾ N-terminal and ¼ C-terminal fragments, which denature in physiological temperature and are further degraded by other MMPs,e.g. gelatinases (see Refs. 1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Taken together, these observations provide evidence for a distinct role and differential regulation of MMP-13 and MMP-1 in human cutaneous wound repair. In the present study, we show that MMP-13 is expressed by fibroblasts in normally healing human gingival wounds. In addition, the expression of MMP-13 by human gingival fibroblasts in monolayer culture is induced by TGF-β1 via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade and AP-1 complex. These results demonstrate a fundamental difference in the regulation of MMP-13 expression between human gingival and dermal fibroblasts and suggest that MMP-13 plays an important role in rapid remodeling of collagenous ECM during repair of human gingival wounds, which generally heal with minimal scarring. Human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA) were obtained from Sigma. Human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF), SB203580, and PD98059 were obtained from Calbiochem. Human recombinant interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Gingival wounds were generated for healthy male volunteers by creating V-shaped full thickness wounds (about 1.5 cm long, 2 mm wide) to healthy keratinized palatal gingiva of three human volunteers, as described previously (31Larjava H. Salo T. Haapasalmi K. Kramer R.H. Heino J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). After 3, 7, 14, and 28 days, the wound samples were obtained by punch biopsy, the tissue was rinsed briefly with physiological saline, embedded in Tissue-Tek®, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until used. Frozen sections (6 μm) were prepared and used for immunohistochemical stainings. The procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Turku, Finland. MMP-13 and MMP-1 immunostainings were performed on acetone-fixed frozen sections using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique and diaminobenzidine as chromogenic substrate. Mouse monoclonal antibody against human MMP-13 (Calbiochem, Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) was diluted 1:10 and reacted for 1 h at 37 °C. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against human MMP-1 (AB806; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was diluted 1:100 and reacted overnight at 4 °C. Harris hematoxylin was used as counterstain. Human gingival fibroblasts were grown from an explant from healthy marginal gingiva of a 25-year-old female volunteer. Fibroblast cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Flow Laboratories, Irvine, United Kingdom) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mmglutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Collagen gels were prepared from bovine dermal collagen, which contains 95% type I collagen and 5% type III collagen (Cellon, Strassen, France), as described previously (30Ravanti L. Heino J. López-Otı́n C. Kähäri V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2446-2455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). As controls, fibroblasts were plated on plastic as monolayer and cultured under similar conditions. In the experiments involving cytokines and growth factors, cells were first incubated for 24 h as monolayer or inside collagen gels, after which the modulators were added, and the incubations continued for an additional 24 h. Fibroblasts were released from collagen gels by brief treatment with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (type II, Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with 1 mm CaCl2. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells using the single-step method (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total RNA (16–20 μg) were fractionated on 0.8% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred to Zeta probe filter (Bio-Rad) by vacuum transfer (VacuGene XL; LKB, Bromma, Sweden), and immobilized by heating at 80 °C for 30 min. The filters were prehybridized for 2 h and subsequently hybridized for 20 h with cDNAs labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random priming. For hybridizations, MMP-13 cDNA fragments covering the coding region and part of the 3′-untranslated region of the human MMP-13 cDNA (altogether 1.9 kb) were used (28Johansson N. Westermarck J. Leppä S. Häkkinen L. Koivisto L. López-Otı́n C. Peltonen J. Heino J. Kähäri V.-M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 243-250PubMed Google Scholar).

The32P-cDNA/mRNA hybrids were visualized with autoradiography, quantified with densitometry, and corrected for the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA for each sample. Human gingival fibroblasts were maintained in serum-free DMEM for 18 h, after which TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) was added, and the incubations were continued for 24 h. Equal aliquots of the conditioned media were analyzed by Western blotting, as described previously (30Ravanti L. Heino J. López-Otı́n C. Kähäri V.-M. J. Biol.

For a TIMP-1 Western blot, samples were reduced with 5% mercaptoethanol prior to electrophoretic fractionation. Specific binding of antibodies was detected with corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The levels of immunoreactive MMP-13, MMP-1, MMP-3, and TIMP-1 were quantitated by densitometric scanning of the x-ray films. The activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK was determined by Western blotting using antibodies specific for phosphorylated, activated forms of the corresponding MAPKs (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Fibroblasts were treated with TGF-β1 in DMEM with 0.5% FCS at various time points and lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were then sonicated, fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blotting was performed as described previously (31Larjava H. Salo T. Haapasalmi K. Kramer R.H. Heino J. J. Clin.

Infection of cells with adenoviruses was performed as described previously (43Ahonen M. Baker A.H. Kähäri V.-M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2310-2315PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the infection efficiency of human gingival fibroblasts, cells in suspension were mixed with RAdlacZ at different multiplicities of infection (MOI), plated, and incubated for 18 h. The cells were then fixed and stained for β-galactosidase activity, as described (43Ahonen M. Baker A.H. Kähäri V.-M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2310-2315PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments with adenoviruses for dominant negative Rac1 (RAdN17rac1), p38α (RAdp38AF), and c-Jun (RAdTAM67) 2 × 105 cells in suspension were mixed with the corresponding viruses or with RAd66 at a MOI of 500 pfu/cell, plated, and incubated for 5 h in DMEM with 1% FCS. The medium was then changed to DMEM without serum, TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) was added, the incubations were continued for 24 h, and conditioned media were analyzed for the levels of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 by Western blot analysis. In experiments with adenoviruses for constitutively active MAPK kinases, 5 × 105fibroblasts in suspension were mixed with adenovirus RAdlacZ, RAdMEK1CA, RAdMKK6bE, or RAdMKK3bE at a MOI of 500 pfu/cell, plated, and incubated for 18 h in DMEM with 1% FCS. Thereafter, medium was changed to DMEM without serum, the incubations were continued for 24 h, and conditioned media were collected and analyzed for the levels of MMP-13, MMP-1, MMP-3, and TIMP-1 by Western blot analysis. The cell layer was harvested and used to determine activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK, as described above. We have previously noted that MMP-13 is expressed by fibroblasts in chronic human cutaneous ulcers in vivo but not in normally healing dermal wounds (14Vaalamo M. Mattila L. Johansson N.

In addition, MMP-13 expression is detected in fibroblasts in intestinal ulcerations (15Vaalamo M. Karjalainen-Lindsberg M.L. Puolakkainen P. Kere J. Saarialho-Kere U. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1005-1014PubMed Google Scholar) and in chronically inflamed periodontal tissue (16Uitto V.-J. Airola K. Vaalamo M. Johansson N. Putnins E. Firth J.D. Salonen J. López-Otı́n C.

To elucidate the role of MMP-13 in physiological turnover of collagenous ECM, we examined its expression in normally healing human gingival wounds of different ages (3 days to 4 weeks) by immunostaining. Interestingly, MMP-13-positive fibroblasts were detected adjacent to the fibrin clot in 3-day-old wounds and in the vicinity of and within the newly formed granulation tissue at 7 days and also in 2- and 4-week-old wounds (Fig. 1, and data not shown). In contrast, epithelial cells remained negative for MMP-13 in all samples studied (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Fibroblasts in the same areas also stained positive for MMP-1 in all wound samples (Fig. 1), and expression of MMP-1 was also detected in migrating keratinocytes (not shown). These observations demonstrate a remarkable difference in MMP-13 expression between acute gingival and cutaneous (14Vaalamo M. Mattila L. Johansson N. Kariniemi A.-L. Karjalainen-Lindsberg M.-L.

We have recently noted that human skin fibroblasts in culture express MMP-13 only when they are embedded in collagen gel, and once turned on, the expression remains unresponsive to modulation by IL-1β and TNF-α and is down-regulated by TGF-β (30Ravanti L.

To examine the regulation of MMP-13 expression in human gingival fibroblasts, the cells were first cultured for 24 h in monolayer or inside collagen gel and subsequently treated with IL-1β, TNF-α, and TGF-β1 for an additional 24 h, and the expression of MMP-13 mRNAs was determined by Northern blot hybridization. Interestingly, treatment of gingival fibroblasts in monolayer with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) markedly (12.1-fold) enhanced MMP-13 mRNA levels, as compared with untreated cells, which expressed low levels of MMP-13 mRNAs (Fig. 2 A).

Whereas stress-induced apoptosis is mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (Frasch, S. C., Nick, J. A., Fadok, V. A., Bratton, D. L., Worthen, G. S., and Henson, P. M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 8389–8397), signals regulating spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis have not been fully determined. In this study we found increased activation of protein kinase C (PKC)-β and -δ in neutrophils undergoing spontaneous apoptosis, but we show that only activation of PKC-δ was directly involved in the induction of apoptosis. PKC-δ can be proteolytically activated by caspase 3. We detected the 40-kDa caspase-generated fragment of PKC-δ in apoptotic neutrophils and showed that the caspase 3 inhibitor Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone prevented generation of the 40-kDa PKC-δ fragment and delayed neutrophil apoptosis. In a cell-free system, removal of PKC-δ by immunoprecipitation reduced DNA fragmentation, whereas loss of PKC-α, -β, or -ζ had no significant effect. Rottlerin and LY379196 inhibit PKC-δ and PKC-β, respectively. Only Rottlerin was able to delay neutrophil apoptosis. Inhibitors of MAP-ERK kinase 1 (PD98059) or p38 MAP kinase (SB202190) had no effect on neutrophil apoptosis, and activation of p42/44 and p38 MAP kinase did not increase in apoptotic neutrophils. We conclude that spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis involves activation of PKC-δ but is MAP kinase-independent. Neutrophils are short-lived leukocytes that die by apoptosis.

Chemotactic factors generated at sites of infection induce the movement of neutrophils from the blood into the affected tissues. A variety of molecules, including cytokines and bacterial products, then activate the defense systems of the neutrophil, which include phagocytosis, degranulation, and activation of NADPH oxidase. Although neutrophils are crucial in the defense against infection, they have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of tissue injury seen in inflammatory diseases of the lung, kidney, joints, and other organs (1Edwards S.E.

During the resolution of inflammation, effete neutrophils are removed from inflammatory sites by apoptosis, leading to their recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages (4Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H.

Although apoptosis is an intrinsic cell process, a variety of cytokines, primarily those that prime neutrophils (6Stringer R.E. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W. Br. J. Hematol. 1996; 92: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), are able to delay apoptosis. How these effects are achieved is not known, although the modulation of signaling pathways regulating apoptosis is an obvious target in such a short-lived cell. Members of the MAP1 kinase family of signaling enzymes, specifically, p38 MAP kinase, have been shown to be involved in accelerating neutrophil apoptosis in response to stress but do not appear to be involved in spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis (7Frasch S.C.

PKC is a family of 11 isoenzymes that are well conserved across species, suggesting they have specific functions within cells (9Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). Neutrophils have been shown to express several PKC isoenzymes including PKC-α, -β, -δ (10Majumdar S. Rossi M.W. Fujiki T.

Parker P.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have shown that down-regulation of PKC-α induces apoptosis in COS cells, suggesting an anti-apoptotic role for this isoenzyme. In contrast, MacFarlane et al. (13MacFarlane D.E. Manzel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4327-4331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that PKC-β expression was required for promyeloid HL60 cells to undergo differentiation and apoptosis in response to phorbol ester treatment, and the expression of PKC-β was differentially regulated during apoptosis in myelomonocytic U937 cells (14Pongracz J. Deacon E.M. Johnson G.D. Burnett D. Lord J.M. Leuk. Res. 1996; 20: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Also in U937 cells, PKC-δ has been shown to be activated by caspase 3, leading to the generation of a 40-kDa catalytic fragment after the induction of apoptosis by a variety of agents, including Fas ligation (19Ghayur T.

Although PKC has been implicated in signaling pathways regulating spontaneous apoptosis in promyeloid cells (20Pongracz J. Tuffley W. Johnson G.D. Deacon E.M. Burnett D. Stockley R.A. Lord J.M. Exp.

However, the Fas/Fas ligand system has been reported to be involved in mediating spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis (21Iwai K. Miyawaki T. Takizawa T. Konno A. Ohta K. Yachie A. Seki H. Taniguchi N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the signaling pathways downstream of Fas ligation in the neutrophil have not been established. Because PKC-δ has been shown to be activated after Fas ligation in promyeloid cells (19Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), a role for the activation of specific PKC isoenzymes in spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis was investigated. In this report, we show that both PKC-β and -δ were activated during apoptosis, although only the inhibition of PKC-δ delayed spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. We also confirm that p42/44 and p38 MAP kinases are involved in stress-induced apoptosis but are not involved in the regulation of spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. Venous blood (20–100 ml) was taken from healthy volunteers, and neutrophils were isolated on Percoll gradients as described previously (22Afford S.C. Pongracz J. Stockley R.A. Crocker J. Burnett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21612-21616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophil preparations contained >95% neutrophils. Neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) and used immediately as healthy control cells, or they were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere to provide apoptotic cells. Cytospin preparations (3 min, 10 × g; Cytospin 2, Shandon) were made after 6 and 24 h of incubation, differentially stained using a commercial May-Grunwald Giemsa stain (Diff-Quick, Baxter Healthcare Products), and assessed for apoptotic morphology (22Afford S.C. Pongracz J. Stockley R.A. Crocker J. Burnett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21612-21616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC inhibitors, Go6976 and Rottlerin were purchased from Calbiochem and used at the concentrations shown. LY379196 is a novel PKC-β inhibitor (23Jirousek M.R. Gillig J.R. Heath W.F. Gonzalez C.M. McDonald III, J.H. Neel D.A. Rito C.J. Stramm L.E. Singh U. Melikian-Badalian A. Baevsky M. Ballas L.M. Hall S.E. Winneroski L.L. Faul M.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Eli Lilly and used at 10 nm. The caspase 3 inhibitor DEVD-fmk (Calbiochem) was used at 20 μm. Inhibition of caspase 3 was confirmed by assaying caspase 3 activity in 100 μl of neutrophil cell lysates, using a commercial kit and according to manufacturer's instructions (CaspAce; Promega). The MAP-ERK kinase and p38 MAP kinase inhibitors, PD98059 and SB202190 (Calbiochem), were used at 30 and 10 μm,respectively. All inhibitors were included in the incubation medium, and apoptosis was assessed by morphology after 6 h or overnight treatment. PKC activation was assessed by determining the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the particulate fraction of neutrophils (24Griffiths G. Garrone B. Deacon E. Owen P. Pongracz J. Mead G. Bradwell A.R. Watters D. Lord J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 1.5 mm EGTA supplemented with 1.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and lysed by freezing and thawing in liquid nitrogen. The cell lysate was spun (100,000 ×g, 4 °C, 30 min), and the supernatant was removed and treated as the cytosol extract. Particulate proteins were then extracted from the resulting pellet by incubation for 10 min on ice in Buffer A containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Degradation of PKC during the fractionation of neutrophils was monitored by Western blotting and was not greater than 5% for any of the isoenzymes tested. Protein concentrations were determined in cytosol and particulate preparations, and the samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of protein were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore UK, Ltd). PKC isoenzyme immunoreactivity was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PKC-α, -β, and -δ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The anti-PKC-ζ antibody (25Tsutsumi A. Kubo M. Fujii H. Freire-Moar J. Turck C.W. Ransom J.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1746-1754PubMed Google Scholar) was an anti-peptide antibody raised in rabbits and was a kind gift from Dr. J. Ransom (Syntex Research Ltd., Palo Alto, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham International) was used as a secondary antibody. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham International) was used to reveal immunoreactive bands. 10 ng of human recombinant PKC for each isoenzyme (Calbiochem) was applied to the outer lane in each gel to confirm antibody specificity. The subcellular distribution of PKC isoenzymes was assessed using indirect immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. Cytospin preparations were made of apoptotic and non-apoptotic neutrophils and air dried for at least 1 h before fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were incubated with antibody to PKC-δ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at room temperature in a humidified atmosphere and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for an additional 30 min. Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide. Fading of fluorescence was retarded by treatment of stained cells with 2.5% (w/v) 1,4-diazobicyclo(2,2,2)-octane (DABCO; BDH Ltd.) in 80% glycerol. Immunofluorescence was analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy using a MRC 500 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Protein extracts from freshly isolated neutrophils and neutrophils cultured overnight were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated, active forms of p42/44 and p38 MAP kinase (Promega). Immunoreactive bands were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Nuclei were isolated from neutrophils using a rapid procedure developed for hemopoietic cells (26Bunce C.M. Thick J.A. Lord J.M. Mills D. Brown G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cytosol was prepared from neutrophils incubated for 24 h to give >75% apoptotic cells. Neutrophils were lysed in Buffer A and spun at 100,000 × g to recover the cytosol (supernatant) fraction. Healthy nuclei were combined with apoptotic cytosol, and DNA fragmentation was measured after 30 min using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based commercial kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To deplete PKC isoenzymes, the apoptotic cytosol was incubated with PKC isoenzyme antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 10 μg/ml extract for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by a mouse anti-rabbit IgG antibody and protein A coupled to agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunocomplexes were removed by centrifugation, and the remaining cytosol was combined with the healthy nuclei. Depletion of PKC was confirmed by Western blotting. Mouse immunoglobulin G was used as control. Data presented here represent a minimum of three experiments, and, where appropriate, data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's ttest, and p < 0.05 was taken as a significantly different value. The level of apoptosis in freshly isolated neutrophils (Fig. 1) was low (2.2 ± 0.7%;n = 5) and increased significantly as cells were aged in culture to 11.6 ± 5.1% after 6 h (p < 0.05; n = 5) and 68.0 ± 15% after 24 h (p < 0.001; n = 5). PKC resides in the cytosol in the inactive state and is translocated to the membrane fraction upon activation. Assessment of particulate (membrane) and cytosolic PKC can thus give an indication of enzyme activation. Immunoblotting of neutrophil particulate and cytosolic protein extracts revealed an increase in PKC-β and -δ isoenzymes associated with the particulate fraction during apoptosis (Fig. 2 A). Translocation of PKC-α was not detected, and the majority of PKC-α was located in the cytosol. PKC-ζ was also detected only in the cytosol fraction of neutrophils, but its subcellular localization did not alter as neutrophils were aged in culture (Fig. 2 A). PKC-δ can also be activated by caspase 3. A 40-kDa fragment of PKC-δ was not detected in freshly isolated neutrophils, and only the full-length 78-kDa form was seen. However, as cells were aged overnight in culture and entered apoptosis, a 40-kDa fragment was detected, and the level of the 78-kDa PKC-δ was reduced concomitantly (Fig. 2 B). The appearance of the 40-kDa PKC-δ fragment was reduced when DEVD-fmk was included in the medium (Fig. 2 B), confirming that generation of the active fragment of PKC-δ was mediated by caspase 3. Inhibition of caspase 3 activity by DEVD-fmk was confirmed in the same extracts (Fig. 2 C). Although PKC-ζ can also be cleaved by caspase 3, we did not detect the cleaved form of this isoenzyme in neutrophils (data not shown). To determine whether the activation of PKC-β and -δ seen in apoptotic cells was involved in the apoptotic process, three PKC isoenzyme-selective inhibitors were used. Go6976 inhibits the classical PKC isoenzymes (PKC-α, -β, and -γ), LY379196 is a PKC-β-specific inhibitor (23Jirousek M.R. Gillig J.R. Heath W.F. Gonzalez C.M. McDonald III, J.H. Neel D.A. Rito C.J. Stramm L.E. Singh U. Melikian-Badalian A. Baevsky M. Ballas L.M. Hall S.E. Winneroski L.L. Faul M.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and Rottlerin inhibits PKC-δ (27Gscwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Because PKC-δ can be activated by caspase 3, the effect of the caspase 3 inhibitor (DEVD-fmk) on neutrophil apoptosis was also determined. Go6976 and LY379196 did not decrease apoptosis in neutrophil cultures after an overnight incubation (Fig. 3 A). However, Rottlerin and DEVD-fmk inhibited neutrophil apoptosis significantly (Fig. 3 A). The inhibition of PKC isoenzymes by the inhibitors used was confirmed by Western blotting of neutrophil cytosol and particulate extracts (Fig. 3 B). To attempt to confirm the data gained with pharmacological inhibitors of PKC isoenzymes, a cell-free system was used. Nuclei were isolated from non-apoptotic neutrophils and combined with cytosol from apoptotic neutrophils after the removal of individual PKC isoenzymes by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 A). Apoptosis was then assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method to detect DNA fragmentation. Cytosol from apoptotic neutrophils (A+) induced a significant increase in DNA fragmentation in non-apoptotic nuclei, compared with the addition of cytosol from healthy neutrophils (A0, Fig. 4 B). The removal of PKC-δ by immunoprecipitation significantly decreased DNA fragmentation induced by the apoptotic cytosol. Loss of PKC-β gave a slight but not significant reduction in DNA fragmentation, and removal of PKC-α or -ζ or the addition of a mouse IgG had no effect (Fig. 4 B). Inhibitors of MAP-ERK kinase 1 (PD98059), which lies upstream of p42/44 MAP kinase, and p38 MAP kinase (SB202190) were used to determine whether members of the MAP kinase family were involved in the regulation of spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. Neither of these agents affected the level of neutrophil apoptosis when they were included in the culture medium for 6 h (data not shown) or overnight (Fig. 5 A). In addition, activated p42/44 MAP kinase and p38 MAP kinase detected by antibodies specific for the active forms of these kinases were barely detectable in freshly isolated or spontaneously apoptotic neutrophils (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, activated p38 MAP kinase was present at a high level in neutrophils induced to die by UV irradiation (Fig. 5 B), and p42/44 MAP kinase was activated by treatment of neutrophils with phorbol myristic acid (Fig. 5 B). The Western blotting data indicating PKC-δ translocation to the particulate fraction were investigated further by immunohistochemistry. Comparison of PKC-δ immunostaining in freshly isolated neutrophils (Fig. 6 A) and neutrophils cultured for 8 h (Fig. 6 B) revealed an increase in PKC-δ associated with the nucleus in many cells. The increase in nuclear PKC-δ was quantitated by determining the percentage of total PKC-δ fluorescence that was coincident with the red fluorescence of the propidium iodide nuclear counterstain. In each study, 100 cells were examined, and the mean value for nuclear PKC-δ increased from 7.7 ± 0.4% in healthy neutrophils to 21.4 ± 1.5% in neutrophils cultured for 8 h. Staining of neutrophils aged for a longer time period in culture was not possible because these cells were more fragile and were not suitable for immunostaining. Much research has focused on the apoptotic program in proliferating cells, but little is known about the regulation of apoptosis in fully differentiated cells, such as neutrophils. However, the pathological consequences of an altered neutrophil life span are considerable (1Edwards S.E. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Neutrophil. 1st Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and New York1994Crossref Google Scholar, 2Hogg J.C. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1249-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 3Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3855) Google Scholar). In this study, the involvement of PKC isoenzymes and MAP kinases in spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis has been investigated. We confirmed previous reports that p38 MAP kinase is involved in inducing signals for neutrophil death in response to stress (7Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, the p38 MAP kinase pathway is not involved in spontaneous apoptosis, suggesting that this pathway in the neutrophil may be activated solely in response to stress-induced apoptosis. PKC is known to be involved in neutrophil activation and in the regulation of apoptosis in a variety of cells. The 11 PKC isoenzymes appear to play various roles in the regulation of apoptosis (8Deacon E.M. Pongracz J. Griffiths G. Lord J.M. J. Clin. Pathol. Mol. Pathol. 1997; 50: 124-131Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but PKC-δ is consistently a pro-apoptotic PKC isoenzyme. PKC-δ can be cleaved by caspase 3, and transfection of cells with the caspase-generated catalytic fragment of PKC-δ is sufficient to induce apoptosis (28Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The data reported here show that PKC-δ is activated during spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of PKC-δ activation by either use of a selective inhibitor or inhibition of caspase 3 delayed neutrophil apoptosis significantly. The caspase 3 inhibitor produced a greater delay in apoptosis than the PKC-δ inhibitor. This is not surprising, because PKC-δ is one of the many targets of this protease. Other substrates of caspase 3 include ICAD, the inhibitor of the apoptosis-specific endonuclease caspase-activated DNase (29Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 393: 396-400Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and cytoskeletal proteins such as actin (30Mashima T. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2423-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and fodrin (31Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of PKC-δ may remove one of the elements of the apoptotic program but would not be able to prevent it altogether. Until recently, PKC-δ and the very closely related isoform PKC-θ were the only PKC isoenzymes reported to undergo proteolytic cleavage and activation by caspase 3. It has now been shown that PKC-ζ can also be cleaved by caspase 3, but in this case, apoptosis was associated with inhibition of PKC-ζ enzyme activity rather than activation (32Frutos S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10765-10770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of caspase 3 during apoptosis can result in the cleavage of both PKC-δ and -ζ, simultaneously effecting the activation of a pro-apoptotic PKC and the inhibition of an anti-apoptotic PKC isoenzyme. Although PKC-ζ was expressed in neutrophils, we did not detect proteolytic cleavage in spontaneously apoptotic neutrophils. Therefore, this pathway may either operate only in certain cells or be activated only during stress-induced apoptosis. We detected translocation of PKC-β in apoptotic neutrophils but did not detect proteolytic fragmentation of this isoenzyme. In a cell-free system, depletion of PKC-β from apoptotic cytosol did not significantly reduce DNA fragmentation in healthy nuclei, and the PKC-β inhibitor LY379196 did not delay neutrophil apoptosis. These data do not support a primary role for PKC-β in spontaneous apoptosis. Moreover, PKC-β has been proposed to play a role in neutrophil activation rather than apoptosis and may be involved in NADPH complex assembly and superoxide generation (33Parmer T.G. Ward M.D. Hait W.N. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 327-334PubMed Google Scholar, 34Nairn A.C. Picciolto M.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We excluded the possibility that PKC-β translocation was associated with activation of neutrophils in these studies by measuring superoxide generation. None was detected, suggesting that the translocation of PKC-β is an apoptosis-associated event. The data reported here suggest that PKC isoenzymes play several roles in the regulation of spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis, with PKC-δ playing a key role. Because p38 MAP kinase was not activated during spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis, we propose that PKC-δ represents a primary signaling pathway, maintaining a basal rate of spontaneous apoptosis. Additional pathways can be recruited to increase the rate of neutrophil death, including the MAP kinase pathway, in situations requiring accelerated apoptosis. The upstream mechanisms leading to activation of caspase 3 and PKC-δ in spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis are still unclear. Ligation of Fas has been suggested (21Iwai K. Miyawaki T. Takizawa T. Konno A. Ohta K. Yachie A. Seki H. Taniguchi N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because neutrophils express both Fas and its ligand. However, this is unlikely because Fas-blocking antibodies are ineffective (35Brown S.B. Savill J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 480-485PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that spontaneous apoptosis is a result of cytokine deprivation; several pro-inflammatory cytokines are able to prevent neutrophil apoptosis (6Stringer R.E. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W. Br. J. Hematol. 1996; 92: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36Lee A. Whyte M.K.B. Haslett C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown recently that cytokine deprivation-induced apoptosis of T cells also involves activation of PKC-δ (37Scheel-Toellner D. Pilling D. Akbar A.N. Hardie D. Lombardi D. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2603-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The association of PKC-δ with the nucleus during apoptosis and its subsequent activation by caspase 3 have recently been reported in U937 cells after ionizing irradiation (38Bharti A. Kraeft S-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and during cytokine deprivation and Fas-induced apoptosis in T cells (37Scheel-Toellner D. Pilling D. Akbar A.N. Hardie D. Lombardi D. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2603-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of PKC-δ may therefore be an early event in the apoptotic program, preceding the common pathway that follows caspase 3 activation. The tyrosine kinase c-abl can be activated by ionizing irradiation, resulting in phosphorylation of PKC-δ and translocation to the nucleus. Tyrosine phosphorylation may be a general mechanism for nuclear translocation of PKC-δ. In summary, PKC isoenzymes play several distinct roles in the regulation of spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. The translocation of PKC-δ to the nucleus and its activation by caspase 3 appear to be crucial events. PKC-δ may therefore represent a useful therapeutic target in conditions of disregulated neutrophil apoptosis. We are grateful to Mike Salmon for critical discussion of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2027235796,"Enzyme localization often plays a controlling role in determining its activity and specificity. Protein kinase C (PKC) has long been known to translocate in response to physiological stimuli as well as to exogenous ligands such as the phorbol esters. We report here that different phorbol derivatives and related ligands, selected for differences in chemical structure and profile of biological activity, induce distinct patterns of redistribution of PKC δ. Localization of a PKC δ-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct was monitored in living Chinese hamster ovary cells as a function of ligand, concentration, and time using confocal laser scanning microscopy. δ-PKC-GFP was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm, with some in the nucleus and perinuclear region. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced plasma membrane translocation followed by slower nuclear membrane translocation. As the concentration of PMA increased, the proportion of nuclear to plasma membrane localization increased markedly. In contrast to PMA, bryostatin 1, a unique activator of PKC that induces a subset of PMA-mediated responses while antagonizing others, at all doses induced almost exclusively nuclear membrane translocation. Like PMA, the complete tumor promoter 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate induced plasma membrane and slower nuclear membrane translocation, whereas the inhibitor of tumor promotion 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate, which differs only in its side chain, induced a distinctive distribution of PKC δ-GFP. Finally, the novel constrained diacylglycerol derivative B8-DL-B8 induced a slow Golgi localization. We speculate that differential control of PKC δ localization may provide an interesting strategy for producing ligands with differential biological consequences.

Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar, 2Parker P.J. Dekker L.V. Parker C.P.J. Dekkers L.V. Protein Kinase. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1997: 1-9Google Scholar). The 12 subspecies of protein kinase C identified so far define four subfamilies: the classical PKCs (α, βI/BII, γ) are Ca2+-dependent and diacylglycerol (DAG)1-responsive; the novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, θ) are Ca2+-independent and DAG-responsive; the atypical PKCs (ζ and λ/ι) are both Ca2+ and DAG-independent; and the PKC-μ/PKD subfamily (PKD1 and 2) possesses a number of unique structural features, including a nonhomologous kinase domain. Different PKC isoforms may fulfill both redundant and unique biological roles within cells (3Pears C. J. Biosci. 1995; 20: 311-332Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the basis for this specificity is an area of active investigation. The structure of PKC can be divided into two functionally distinct halves: an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. There are two conserved regions, C1 and C2, in the regulatory domain of the classical PKCs. The twin C1 domains are zinc finger structures that interact with lipids and constitute the binding site for DAG and the phorbol esters (4Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of the complex between the C1 domain of PKC δ and phorbol 13-acetate suggests that the C1 domain functions as a hydrophobic switch (5Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The C1 domain displays a hydrophobic surface interrupted by a hydrophilic cleft. By inserting into the hydrophilic cleft, the phorbol ester or DAG provides a hydrophobic cap over this hydrophilic cleft, facilitating the association of the C1 domain with the lipid bilayer or other hydrophobic surfaces. The C2 domain binds Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine (6Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 7Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). In the novel PKCs, a modified C2 domain is present that does not bind Ca2+ (8Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 207-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The functions of PKCs are tightly regulated by the structures of the C1 and C2 domains and the cofactors that associate with them (2Parker P.J. Dekker L.V. Parker C.P.J. Dekkers L.V. Protein Kinase. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1997: 1-9Google Scholar). The translocation of PKC from cytoplasm to plasma membrane is a hallmark for PKC activation (10Mochly-Rosen D. Henrich C.J. Cheever L. Khaner H. Simpson P.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1990; 1: 693-706Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The isozyme-specific functions may result in part from their differential subcellular localization (11Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PKC, the dynamics of PKC translocation in response to different stimuli can be monitored in live cells and in real time. Several studies have shown that the translocation of PKC is isoform-, cell type-, and activator-specific and is tightly regulated by the various cofactors (12Sakai N.K. Sasaki N. Ikegaki Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 13Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest F.G.A. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 14Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An important observation to emerge from the natural product isolation of the phorbol esters and related derivatives was that derivatives could differ markedly in the patterns of biological response that they induced (16Fürstenberger V.G. Hecker E. Planta Med. 1972; 22: 241-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Bryostatin 1 induces only a subset of the typical phorbol ester responses and antagonizes those responses that it fails to induce (17Blumberg P.M. Pettit G.R. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Christensen S.B. Kofod H. New Leads and Targets in Drug Design Research. Munksgaard International Publishers, Copenhagen1992: 273-285Google Scholar). In contrast to 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate, which is a potent irritant agent and tumor promoter (18Zayed S. Sorg B. Hecker E. Planta Med. 1984; 8: 65-69Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), some of its more hydrophilic derivatives such as 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate are antihyperplastic and antitumor promoting (19Szallasi Z. Krausz K. Blumberg P.M. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 2161-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Szallasi Z. Krsmanovic L. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2507-2512PubMed Google Scholar). Such differences cannot be explained by their intrinsic activity on PKC, because all of these agents induce similar levels of activation in vitro. In this report, utilizing a green fluorescent protein fusion construct with PKC δ, we explore the hypothesis that different ligands may induce different patterns of translocation of PKC. PMA, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate, and 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate were obtained from LC Services Corp. (Woburn, MA). Bryostatin 1 was from the Drug Chemistry and Synthesis Branch, NCI. The constrained DAG lactone (dl)-(Z)- {1-(hydroxymethyl)-4-[4-methyl-3-(methylethyl)pentylidene]-3-oxo-2-oxolan-yl}methyl4-methyl-3-(methylethyl)pentanoate (referred to in the text as B8-DL-B8) was synthesized as will be described elsewhere. 2K. Nacro, B. Bienfait, J. Lee, K.-C. Han, J.-H. Kang, S. Benzaria, N. E. Lewin, P. M. Blumberg, and V. E. Marquez, submitted for publication. BODIPY TR ceramide, MitoTracker Red CMXRos, rhodamine 6G chloride, and LysoTracker Red DND-99 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). MluI linker (d(pG ACG CGT C)) was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). CHO-K1 cells (CCL 61) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4500 mg/liter glucose, 4 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. A plasmid pEGFP-N1 encoding the GFP was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). A MluI restriction site was generated by inserting a MluI linker into the plasmid digested with SmaI. A mouse PKC δ cDNA fragment with MluI sites on both ends was produced by polymerase chain reaction. After digestion with MluI, the PKC δ cDNA insert was subcloned into the expression vector pEGFP-N1 with the GFP attached to the 3′-end of PKC δ. The junction of PKC δ and GFP in the constructed plasmid was verified by sequencing, which was performed by the DNA minicore, Division of Basic Sciences, NCI, National Institutes of Health. CHO-K1 cells were grown on 40-mm round coverslips (Bioptechs, Inc., Butler, PA) to 50–75% confluence. Transient transfection was conducted using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. The fluorescence became detectable 24 h after transfection, and all experiments were performed 3 days after transfection. Cell lysates obtained 3 days after transfection were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline and probed with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) or with an anti-PKC δ antibody (R & D Antibodies, Berkeley, CA). Signals were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Prior to observation, transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells were washed twice with standard medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum) prewarmed to 37 °C. All PKC activators were diluted to specified concentrations in the same medium, and the final concentration of solvent (Me2SO) was always less than 0.01%. For live cell imaging, the Bioptechs Focht Chamber System (FCS2) was inverted and attached to the microscope stage with a custom stage adapter. The cells cultured on a 40-mm round coverslip were introduced into the chamber system, which was connected to a temperature controller set at 37 °C, and medium was perfused through the chamber with a model P720 microperfusion pump (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA). As indicated, the perfusate to the chamber was changed to that containing the specified ligand for PKC and sequential images of the same cell were then collected at 1-min intervals using LaserSharp software through a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal scan head mounted on a Nikon Optiphot microscope with a 60× planapochromat lens. Excitation at 488 nm was provided by a krypton-argon gas laser with a 522/32 emission filter for green fluorescence. CHO-K1 cells expressing δ-PKC-GFP were treated for 25–30 min at 37 °C with BODIPY TR ceramide (2 μg/ml) to stain for Golgi apparatus, with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (0.03 μg/ml) for mitochondria, rhodamine 6G chloride (0.1 μg/ml) for endoplasmic reticulum, and LysoTracker Red DND-99 (50 nm) for lysosomes. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were treated with different PKC activators in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red with 1% fetal bovine serum as specified in the text and figure legends. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. All slides were mounted with FluoroGuard Antifade Reagent (Bio-Rad). After the cDNA construct had been verified by sequencing, the pEGFP plasmid encoding δ-PKC-GFP was transiently transfected into CHO-K1 cells. As a control, the pEGFP plasmid without the δ-PKC insert was transfected in parallel. The immunoreactivity of the transfected cells was examined by Western blotting. As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, GFP and δ-PKC-GFP were identified by a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody as specific bands with the expected molecular sizes, 26 and 105 kDa, respectively. A polyclonal anti-PKC δ antibody likewise recognized the δ-PKC-GFP as a 105-kDa protein but did not recognize the 26-kDa band corresponding to GFP. A low level of proteolysis was also evident as reflected in lower molecular weight bands in the δ-PKC-GFP expressing cells. To determine whether degradation of δ-PKC-GFP was induced over the time period of our incubations (0–40 min) in the presence of ligand, we compared by Western blotting total cell lysates of δ-PKC-GFP expressing cells incubated for 40 min in the presence or absence of 1 μm PMA. No increase in degradation was observed (Fig. 1 A). Finally, in CHO cells expressing GFP alone, we saw no translocation in the presence of 1 μm PMA (Fig. 1 B); all GFP remained in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The patterns of translocation that we describe below for the δ-PKC-GFP therefore appear to reflect the intact fusion protein. In order to explore the specificity of δ-PKC-GFP translocation in response to different ligands, we examined a series of compounds that had been shown previously to differ substantially in their biological activities. PMA is the archetypal phorbol ester tumor promoter, whereas bryostatin 1 is a partial protein kinase C antagonist. Among 12-deoxyphorbol 13-monoesters, we compared 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate with 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate, since a long ester chain such as tetradecanoate confers promoting activity, whereas a more hydrophilic phenylacetate group confers antipromoting activity. Finally, we examined one of the novel constrained DAG analogs which has been found to have high potency for PKC as well as a novel pattern of selectivity.2 In the absence of stimuli, approximately 85% of δ-PKC-GFP was present in the cytoplasm, and 15% in the nucleus. When a single dose of the complete tumor promoter PMA was added, δ-PKC-GFP slowly translocated to the plasma and nuclear membranes (illustrated for 1 μm PMA in Fig. 2 A). The extent and timing of the translocation depended on the concentration of PMA (Fig. 2,B and C). At 10 nm PMA little translocation was seen to either compartment. At 100 nmPMA, there was predominantly plasma membrane translocation, reaching a peak at 10 min, with a slower and more limited nuclear membrane localization at 20–30 min. At 1 μm PMA, the translocation to the plasma membrane was more rapid, peaking by 5 min, and was greater than that at 100 nm PMA (Fig. 2 B). Translocation to the nuclear membrane was slower but more extensive. Between 10 and 15 min it exceeded the level of translocation to the plasma membrane and continued to rise, while the level of plasma membrane translocation decreased. Fig. 2 Cshows the maximal plasma and nuclear membrane translocation as a function of dose of PMA. Over the dose range examined (10 nm to 10 μm), the extent of maximal translocation to both compartments increased as a function of dose. At doses below 300 nm, the plasma membrane localization was predominant, whereas at higher doses the nuclear membrane localization was predominant. Bryostatin 1 generated a distinct pattern of δ-PKC-GFP translocation under our conditions. Compared with PMA, bryostatin 1 induced prominent nuclear membrane translocation with only transient and minimal plasma membrane translocation (Fig. 3 A). In addition, there seemed to be a more apparent perinuclear localization of δ-PKC-GFP in the bryostatin 1 treated cells compared with the PMA-treated cells. The lack of plasma membrane localization was independent of the dose of bryostatin 1 over the range examined (10 nm to 10 μm) (Fig. 3, B and C). The rates of translocation induced by bryostatin 1 and PMA cannot be directly compared because of the different patterns of localization. Thus, whereas 100 nm PMA initiated a considerably earlier response than did 100 nm bryostatin 1, the PKC translocated to the plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane, respectively. If comparison was limited to nuclear translocation, the rates of translocation in response to bryostatin 1 and PMA were more similar, and indeed 1 μm bryostatin 1 induced somewhat more rapid nuclear translocation than did 1 μm PMA, as reflected by the slopes of the two nuclear membrane translocation curves. At the onset of bryostatin 1 induced translocation (5–10 min after treatment of 1 μm bryostatin in Fig. 3 A), some patchy cytoplasmic distribution of δ-PKC-GFP was also observed. This colocalized neither with endoplasmic reticulum (visualized with rhodamine 6G chloride) nor with mitochondria (visualized with MitoTracker Red CMXRos). The pair of analogs 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate and 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate differ substantially in the pattern of translocation of δ-PKC-GFP that they induce, consistent with their very different behavior as tumor promoters. Like PMA, the tumor-promoting analog 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate (1 μm) caused translocation first to the plasma membrane and then to the nuclear membrane (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the inhibitor of tumor promotion 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate (1 μm) predominantly induced nuclear membrane localization with little plasma membrane localization. In addition, there was a patchy pattern of fluorescence appearing throughout the cytoplasm after ligand addition (Fig. 4 B). 12-Deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate and 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate were also examined at concentrations of 10 nm, 100 nm, 1 μm, and 3 μm. The difference in their patterns of translocation remained the same, although the rate and the extent of maximal membrane translocation increased as a function of dose (data not shown). In an effort to determine the basis for the punctate staining upon treatment with 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate, we stained the cells with fluoroprobes for the Golgi network, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and lysosomes, and assessed colocalization with the δ-PKC-GFP; in no case did the markers colocalize. B8-DL-B8 is a constrained DAG analog that was shown previously to be only 15-fold less potent than phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate in in vitro experiments (21Marquez V.E. Nacro K. Benzaria S. Lee J. Sharma R. Teng K. Milne G.W. Bienfait B. Wang S. Lewin N.E. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). B8-DL-B8 at 1 μm induced a strong perinuclear localization with some nuclear membrane localization, but less plasma membrane localization (Fig. 5 A). Relative to PMA, the constrained diacylglycerol induced slow translocation, achieving a stable pattern by 40 min of treatment. In order to identify the perinuclear compartment to which δ-PKC-GFP localized after the treatment with the DAG analog, cells were pretreated with a red fluorescent probe BODIPY TR ceramide to visualize the Golgi network. Fig. 5 B, panel ii, illustrates a field of cells treated with 1 μm B8-DL-B8 and stained with the BODIPY TR ceramide, showing the red-stained Golgi network. In this field, two of the cells expressed the transfected δ-PKC-GFP, displaying perinuclear localization in the presence of B8-DL-B8 (Fig. 5 B, panel i). Superposition of the images showed the marked colocalization of δ-PKC-GFP and the Golgi network in the perinuclear region (Fig. 5B, panel iii). As a control, we confirmed that BODIPY TR ceramide (2 μg/ml) by itself did not affect the distribution of δ-PKC-GFP (data not shown). Elucidation of the multiple factors that account for the diversity of biological effects depending on PKC isoform, on cell type, and on activating ligand forms a central focus in the PKC field. Differences in substrate preference of isoforms clearly contribute to this diversity (22Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.-J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Thus, for example, the γ-chain of the FcεRI receptor (23Germano P. Gomez J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23102-23107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the elongation factor EEF-1α (24Kielbassa K. Muller H.J. Meyer H.E. Marks F. Gschwendt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6156-6162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have been identified as somewhat selective substrates for protein kinase C δ. The role of interacting proteins to drive localization to a distinctive microenvironment, enhancing phosphorylation of those substrates in that microenvironment, represents another mechanism. The presence of PKC-anchoring proteins, such as RICKs and RACKs, has been demonstrated in cardiac myocytes (11Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Terrian and co-workers (25Prekeris R. Mayhew M.W. Cooper J.B. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) have identified a region of PKC ε that interacts with the actin cytoskeleton and affects its biological activity. Jaken and collaborators (26Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Dong L. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 793-798PubMed Google Scholar) have described a series of binding proteins for PKCs that are also PKC substrates. Differential subcellular localization has been demonstrated usingin vitro approaches such as light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry in tissues and cultured cells (11Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 28Hyatt S.L. Klauck T. Jaken S. Mol. Carcinog. 1990; 3: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Goodnight J. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9991-10001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Moreover, using GFP-tagged PKCs, several studies have shown unique patterns of translocation of PKCs in living cells in response to different physiological activators. Oancea and Meyer (30Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) have described that the coordination between calcium spikes and diacylglycerol signals tightly controls the extent and timing of cPKC activation using GFP-tagged PKC γ. Distinctive patterns of translocation of GFP-tagged PKC δ have been reported in response to treatment with ATP, TPA, and H2O2 in CHO-K1 cells (14Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Saito and collaborators (15Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have also shown that fatty acids affect the translocation of PKC-γ and -ε differently, and these two isoforms show different fatty acid specificity. In this study, we have explored the issue of how different ligands, which all interact with the C1 domain of PKC but which vary in structure or in pattern of induced biological response, affect the translocation of PKC δ. GFP-PKC fusions, including those with PKC δ, show similar levels of activation and a similar extent of translocation to that of PKC alone (12Sakai N.K. Sasaki N. Ikegaki Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 14Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, under our assay conditions δ-PKC-GFP was expressed in transiently transfected CHO cells at a reasonable level and showed the expected molecular size. The fusion protein was adequately stable in the absence of ligand and represented the major population of fluorescent donor in the cell. Over the short time course examined, the construct was also stable in the presence of ligand. Contrasting with the homogenous distribution of green fluorescent protein alone, the δ-PKC-GFP showed differential distribution in the cytoplasm, Golgi, and nucleoplasm. In addition, δ-PKC-GFP was translocated to the cell membranes in response to various PKC activators whereas GFP alone did not respond. The mechanism of bryostatin 1 is of great interest both because of its clinical relevance and because of the complexity of its interactions with PKC. The naturally occurring bryostatins are novel antineoplastic compounds that are currently under clinical trials for several malignancies (31Pluda J.M. Cheson B.D. Phillips P.H. Oncology ( Basel ). 1996; 10: 740-742PubMed Google Scholar). Like PMA, bryostatin 1 activates the classical and novel PKCs through high affinity binding to the C1 domain of PKC (32Kazanietz M.G. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Kolch W. Mischak H. Wong G. Pettit G.R. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11590-11594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its action as an activator of PKC, bryostatin 1 induces many biological responses typical of the phorbol esters, such as induction of proliferation in Swiss 3T3 cells (33Smith J.A. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and activation of neutrophils (34Berkow R.L. Kraft A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 131: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the majority of systems bryostatin 1 antagonizes phorbol ester responses, such as differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 (35Kraft A.S. Smith J.B. Berkow R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1334-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and proliferation of human T lymphocytes (36Isakov N. Galron D. Mustelin T. Pettit G.R. Altman A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1195-1204PubMed Google Scholar). Several mechanisms may account for the differential behavior of bryostatin 1. An enhanced rate of PKC down-regulation has been demonstrated in several systems and for several isoforms. On the other hand, in both mouse keratinocytes and in NIH3T3 cells bryostatin 1 has been shown to display biphasic induction of biological responses, paralleling degradation of PKC δ at low doses and protection of PKC δ at high doses (37Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 840-850PubMed Google Scholar, 38Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since PKC δ has been shown to be antiproliferative in these systems, whereas some other PKCs such as PKC ε have been shown to stimulate proliferation, protection of PKC δ provides an attractive model for the antagonistic action of bryostatin 1 in some systems. It is clear, however, that it cannot explain the ability of bryostatin 1 to acutely inhibit phorbol ester action. For example, in C3H10T1/2 cells, 30-min treatment with bryostatin 1 was able to inhibit by 85% the release of arachidonic acid induced by phorbol ester (39Dell'Aquila M.L. Herald C.L. Kamano Y. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3702-3708PubMed Google Scholar). Differential localization of PKC could provide such a mechanism. Here, using GFP-tagged PKC δ, we were able to show that bryostatin 1 and PMA induce distinct patterns of subcellular translocation. Bryostatin 1 caused a localization of δ-PKC-GFP predominantly to the nuclear membrane at all doses used, compared with the consecutive plasma membrane to nuclear membrane localization induced by PMA. Since high concentrations of PMA also caused substantial nuclear membrane localization at later times, we wanted to see if the difference in translocation was merely a reflection of noncomparable doses of the two compounds. Our results showed that the strong nuclear membrane localization induced by bryostatin 1 persisted at lower concentrations, although the magnitude was reduced. In contrast, PMA at lower concentrations induced a more prominent plasma membrane translocation with only minimal nuclear membrane translocation at a later stage (after 20 min of stimulation at 100 nm PMA). This differential pattern of PKC δ localization dependent on the specific dose of PMA is an important basic finding. Examples of complicated dose response relations for PMA have been described (40Little J.B. Nagasawa H. Weichselbaum R.R. Lovett D.R. Schmit A. Kochenburger R.J. Blumberg P.M. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,41Kopelovich L. Bias N.E. Exp. Cell Biol. 1980; 48: 207-217PubMed Google Scholar), including very steep dose-response relations for tumor promotion in mouse skin (42Schmidt R. Hecker E. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1989; 115: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the absence of other possibilities, a plausible interpretation was an effect due to different isoforms with different affinities and functions. The present results argue that different efficacies of response, reflecting the differential localizations, also deserves consideration. The comparison between the two 12-deoxyphorbol 13-monoesters is striking. These two derivatives have similar high affinity for PKC. The promoting derivative 12-deoxyphorbol 13-tetradecanoate closely resembles PMA, another effective tumor promoter, in its pattern of translocation. In contrast, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate, which is antihyperplastic and antipromoting, caused intracellular patches of δ-PKC-GFP as well as less defined but prominent nuclear membrane localization. Our colocalization studies fail to identify the 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate-promoted patchy fluorescence with the intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria or lysosomes. It is possible that 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate-activated δ-PKC-GFP is aggregated or is associated with a set of substrates or anchoring proteins that are in the cytoplasm. The difference between these two derivatives emphasizes the crucial role played by the hydrophobic regions of the PKC ligands in determining their activities. These findings fit with our emerging understanding of the interaction of ligands with the C1 domain (21Marquez V.E. Nacro K. Benzaria S. Lee J. Sharma R. Teng K. Milne G.W. Bienfait B. Wang S. Lewin N.E. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The binding site represents a hydrophilic cleft in the otherwise hydrophobic face of the C1 domain (5Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The phorbol ester fits into this cleft and, by rendering this surface more hydrophobic, causes it to function as a hydrophobic switch, stabilizing its interaction with the plasma membrane. Three factors contribute to the hydrophobic character of the ligand complex: 1) filling of the hydrophilic cleft itself by the phorbol ester, 2) hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and the hydrophobic residues lining the edges of the cleft, and 3) hydrophobic interactions between the side chains of the ligand and the lipid bilayer or proteins associated with it. The 12-deoxyphorbol derivatives aptly illustrate the important role played by these latter effects. In terms of drug design, understanding the specifics of how different hydrophobic domains can drive different localization patterns remains an important objective. The constrained DAG analog is one of the novel ligands to emerge from an on-going extensive synthetic effort to clarify the structural basis for ligand-PKC interactions. Its K d for binding to PKC α in vitro is 2.9 nm, compared with a value for phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate of 0.2 nm.2For inhibition of epidermal growth factor binding to NIH3T3 cells, its ED50 is 170 nm, compared with 20 nmfor phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Finally, it shows a 50% inhibitory concentration for growth of the K-562, COLO 205, and HS 578T tumor cell lines of 2 × 10−8m. Comparison of its relative affinities for PKC α and for β2-chimerin reveals that the constrained DAG shows modest selectivity for β2-chimerin (43Caloca M.J. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Blumberg P.M. Lewin N.E. Kremmer E. Mischak H. Wang S. Bienfait B. Marquez V.E. Kazanietz M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11854-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Here, we show for the first time that the constrained DAG analog translocated δ-PKC-GFP to a perinuclear region colocalizing with the Golgi and to nuclear membrane. This pattern was thus distinct from that induced by the other ligands. The different patterns of localization of PKC δ as revealed with the GFP fusion constructs indicate yet another degree of heterogeneity of PKC response to ligands. These results emphasize again the inadequacy of current in vitro assays for assessing the full depth of PKC structure function relationships. Pressing objectives are to clarify the mechanistic basis for the different patterns of localization as well as to determine the degree to which the differences in localization in fact drive different biology."
https://openalex.org/W2027232305,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a member of an emerging CCN gene family that is implicated in various diseases associated with fibro-proliferative disorder including scleroderma and atherosclerosis. The function of CTGF in human cancer is largely unknown. We now show that CTGF induces apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. CTGF mRNA was completely absent in MCF-7 but strongly induced by treatment with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). TGF-β by itself induced apoptosis in MCF-7, and this effect was reversed by co-treatment with CTGF antisense oligonucleotide. Overexpression of CTGF gene in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells significantly augmented apoptosis. Moreover, recombinant CTGF protein significantly enhanced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells as evaluated by DNA fragmentation, Tdt-mediated dUTP biotin nick end-labeling staining, flow cytometry analysis, and nuclear staining using Hoechst 33258. Finally, recombinant CTGF showed no effect on Bax protein expression but significantly reduced Bcl2 protein expression. Taken together, these results suggest that CTGF is a major inducer of apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and that TGF-β-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells is mediated, in part, by CTGF. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a member of an emerging CCN gene family that is implicated in various diseases associated with fibro-proliferative disorder including scleroderma and atherosclerosis. The function of CTGF in human cancer is largely unknown. We now show that CTGF induces apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7.

A common finding in most of these diseases was a high level expression of CTGF in fibro-proliferative areas of affected tissues. In most cases, a direct correlation between high level CTGF expression and high levels of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expression could be established. In fact, CTGF gene expression has been shown to be regulated by TGF-β (2Oemar B.S. Lüscher T.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1483-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). TGF-β is a pleiotropic growth modulator with a wide variety of activities on different cell types. TGF-β stimulates proliferation of mesenchymal cells but inhibits that of endothelial (12Tsukada T. Eguchi K. Migita K. Kawabe Y. Kawakami A. Matsuoka N. Takashima H. Mizokami A. Nagataki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

TGF-β is also known to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of cancer cell lines including the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (14Khosla S. Oursler M.J. Schroeder M.J. Eberhardt N.L.

In fact, the anticancer effect of tamoxifen has been attributed to indirect activation of TGF-β pathway and induction of apoptosis by TGF-β (16Chen H. Tritton T.R. Kenny N. Absher M. Chiu J.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 17-19Google Scholar). Because CTGF is thought to be a mediator of TGF-β action, it is conceivable that CTGF may also inhibit cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis in these cells. In the present study, we utilized antisense technology, transient overexpression techniques, and recombinant CTGF protein to gain insight into the biological function of CTGF in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. We now provide direct evidence that CTGF is pro-apoptotic in this cell line, suggesting an important role of CTGF in breast cancer biology. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Superfect was purchased from Promega (Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant human CTGF was generously provided by Japan Tobacco (Osaka, Japan). Polyclonal anti-Bcl2 and Bax antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). MCF-7, LK A549, CK201, and Mel D2–2 cancer cell lines were generously provided by the Department of Research, University Hospital of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals, Tulare, CA) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. At 80% confluence, medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM supplemented with Insulin-transferin-selenite (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan) and used for all experiments except Northern analysis. Total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (20 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to a nylon membrane (Highbond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were hybridized in QuickHyb (Strategene, CA) at 68 °C for 2 h with32P-labeled cDNA probes prepared by random prime labeling (17Hishikawa K. Lüscher T.F. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A 0.6-kilobase pair cDNA fragment contained within the open reading frame of CTGF was used as probe. Membranes were exposed to Bio-Max x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C for 2 h. Cell viability was evaluated using an MTT assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, after treatment, cells were incubated for 4 h in the presence of MTT reagent and lysed with lysis buffer. After an overnight incubation, absorbance was measured atA 550 nm to A 690 nm. 48 h after incubation with recombinant 5 μg/ml CTGF, both floating and trypsinized adherent cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and incubated in Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min (final concentration, 30 μg/ml). Nuclear morphology was examined using fluorescence microscopy with standard excitation filters. To calculate the percentage of apoptotic cells, all cells from four random microscopic fields at 400× magnification were counted. DNA fragmentation was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tdt-mediated dUTP biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) was performed with the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals according to the manufacturer's instructions. To calculate the percentage of TUNEL positive cells, we counted all cells from four random microscopic fields at 100× magnification. For flow cytometric analysis, both floating and trypsinized adherent cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with 70% ethanol. After fixation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with propidium iodide for 20 min under subdued light. Stained cells were analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorter caliber (Becton Dickinson, Tokyo, Japan), and DNA content was calculated with Modfit software. 16-mer CTGF sense and antisense oligonucleotides containing the initial ATG translation start site was synthesized (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequences were as follows: antisense, 5′-TACTGGCGGCGGTCAT-3′ (18Shimo T. Nakanishi T. Kimura Y. Nishida T. Ishizeki K. Matsumura T. Takigawa M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and sense, 5′-ATGACCGCCGCCAGTA-3′ (18Shimo T. Nakanishi T. Kimura Y. Nishida T. Ishizeki K. Matsumura T. Takigawa M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide containing a scrambled nucleotide sequence (5′-GGTCTAGCTTGCGGAC-3′) was synthesized and used as an additional control. The synthetic oligonucleotides were directly added to the serum-free medium without any transfection compounds. To overexpress the human CTGF gene in MCF-7 cells, we constructed a mammalian expression vector (pCMV-CTGF) containing the complete open reading frame of the CTGF gene, driven by the CMV promotor (see Fig. 3 A). To increase transcriptional efficiency, a 5′-untranslated intron sequence of the CMV immediate early gene was inserted between the CMV promoter and CTGF gene. A bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal sequence was used as polyadenylation site. Mock transfected cells with pCMV vector alone (empty vector) were used as control. Transient transfection was performed using superfect (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol in serum-free DMEM. Transfection efficiency was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy in cells co-transfected with plasmid containing the green fluorescent protein gene (pEGFP-C1), which was obtained fromCLONTECH. The average transfection efficiency using 1 μg of pEGFP-C1/105 cells was calculated to be about 55%. MCF-7 cells treated with 2.5 and 5 μg/ml recombinant CTGF for 48 h in serum-free DMEM were treated with lysis buffer containing SDS and mercaptoethanol. Primary antibody was used at 1:250 dilution. Cell lysates (20 μg) were subjected to 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (Ready Gel, Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and incubated with 1:250 primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature as described previously (17Hishikawa K. Lüscher T.F. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Hishikawa K. Nakaki T. Marumo T. Suzuki H. Kato R. Saruta T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Equal amount of protein loading was confirmed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining before blotting. The membranes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed with image analysis software NIH-Image 1.60 for the Macintosh Power PC workstation. Caspase 3-like activity was determined using the Caspase-3 Assay Kit (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly cells were lysed and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Then 10 μl of supernatant was incubated with equal amount of substrate (ac-DEVD-p-nitroanilide), and O.D. was measured at 405 nm. Values are the means ± S.E. from four to six experiments. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using analysis of variance followed by Fisher's test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that CTGF mRNA is not detectable by Northern blot or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines grown in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. 2K. Hishikawa, B. S. Oemar, F. C. Tanner, T. Nakaki, T. F. Lüscher, and T. Fujii, unpublished observation. To investigate whether cancer cell lines derived from other organs express CTGF, we analyzed CTGF mRNA expression in the lung cancer-derived LK A549 cell line, the colon cancer-derived CK201 cell line, and the melanoma-derived Mel D2–2 cell line. As expected, MCF-7 grown in 10% fetal bovine serum did not express detectable levels of CTGF mRNA (Fig. 1). In contrast, LK A549, CK201, and Mel D2–2 expressed clearly detectable levels of CTGF mRNA. Surprisingly, CTGF gene expression in MCF-7 cells grown in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum was strongly induced by TGF-β (5 ng/ml) treatment for 48 h (Fig. 1). After 48 h of stimulation with 5 ng/ml TGF-β, CTGF mRNA levels also increased 7-fold in LK A549, 3-fold in CK201, and 1.7 fold in Mel D2–2 cells. TGF-β induces apoptosis and inhibits MCF-7 cell growth, but the exact molecular mechanism is unclear (16Chen H. Tritton T.R. Kenny N. Absher M. Chiu J.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 17-19Google Scholar). To investigate whether CTGF mediates the action of TGF-β in MCF-7 cells, we treated MCF-7 cells with 5–20 μg/ml CTGF antisense oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 2 A, TGF-β (5 ng/ml) significantly reduced cell viability to 65 ± 5%, which was accompanied by an increase in histone-associated DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2 B). Treatment with the CTGF antisense oligonucleotide dose-dependently reversed the effect of TGF-β (Fig. 2). Control experiments using 20 μg/ml scrambled or sense oligonucleotide did not affect TGF-β-induced cell death and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2), suggesting a specific effect of CTGF antisense oligonucleotide in TGF-β-treated cells. We tested higher concentration up to 100 μg/ml, but we could not get any additional specific effects over 20 μg/ml. To investigate the effect of CTGF overexpression in MCF-7 cells, we transfected MCF-7 cells transiently with the expression plasmid pCMV-CTGF (1 μg DNA/105 cells) (Fig. 3 A). CTGF mRNA expression was confirmed using Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 B). 48 h after transfection, cell viability was significantly reduced by 35% (Fig. 4 A), and histone-associated DNA fragmentation increased 3-fold as compared with controls (Fig. 4 B). Mock transfection with pCMV alone did not have any effect on cell viability or DNA fragmentation. To investigate the direct effect of CTGF protein on MCF-7 cells, we used purified recombinant CTGF protein (10Tamatani T. Kobayashi H. Tezuka K. Sakamoto S. Suzuki K. Nakanishi T. Takigawa M. Miyano T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Previous experiments using normal rat kidney fibroblasts confirmed that the recombinant CTGF protein we used was biologically active and induced proliferation in those cells (data not shown). As shown in FIG. 5, FIG. 6, FIG. 7, recombinant CTGF dose-dependently reduced MCF-7 cell viability (Fig. 5 A) and increased the number of apoptotic cells, as judged by DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5 B), TUNEL staining (Fig. 5 C), nuclear staining using Hoechst 33285 (Fig. 6), and flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 7). The number of hypodiploid cells increased from 4.2% in controls to 26.3% in cells treated with recombinant CTGF (Fig. 7).FIG. 6Effects of recombinant CTGF protein on apoptosis in MCF-7 cells as judged by nuclear morphology.

As shown in Fig. 8 A, recombinant CTGF dose-dependently reduced Bcl2 protein concentration in MCF-7 cells, but recombinant CTGF had no effect on Bax protein concentration in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 8 B). In addition, we measured caspase 3-like activity in MCF-7 cells grown in 10% fetal calf serum. However, consistent with recent reports (20Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 21Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), we could not detect caspase 3 activity in these cells (data not shown). In the present study, we demonstrate that CTGF induces apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Our data suggest a potential role for CTGF in human breast cancer cells based on the following observations: 1) MCF-7 cells lacked CTGF mRNA expression when maintained in culture in the presence of fetal bovine serum, 2) recombinant CTGF protein dose-dependently induced apoptosis and reduced Bcl2 protein expression in MCF-7 cells, 3) transient overexpression of CTGF gene induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, 4) TGF-β strongly induced CTGF mRNA expression and reduced MCF-7 cell viability, and 5) CTGF antisense oligonucleotide dose-dependently inhibited TGF-β-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. CTGF is a member of a growing gene family termed the CCN gene family that is characterized by a high degree of amino acid sequence homology ranging from 50 to 90%. All members of the CCN gene family possess a secretory signal peptide at the N terminus, indicating that they are secreted proteins. In fact, human and mouse CTGF have been found in the conditioned medium of cultured endothelial cells and fibroblasts, respectively (6Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 22Ryseck R.P. Macdonald-Bravo H. Mattei M.G. Bravo R. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar), and both Cyr61 and Nov were found to be mainly associated with cell surface and extracellular matrix (23Scholz G. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar). All members of the CCN gene family contain 38 totally conserved cysteine residues that are clustered in two segments (22 at the N-terminal region and 16 at the C-terminal region), separated by a region that varies in length and amino acid composition. Detailed analysis by Bork (1Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of four distinct protein modules in this CCN protein family: 1) an insulin-like growth factor binding domain with the conserved putative IGF binding motif Gly-Cys-Gly-Cys-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys (Xaa is any amino acid) located within the N-terminal portion of all IGF binding proteins, 2) a Von Willebrand factor type C repeat, which is thought to participate in oligomerization and protein complex formation, 3) a thrombospondin type 1 repeat, which is thought to be involved in binding to both soluble and matrix macromolecules, and in particular to sulfated glycoconjugates, and 4) a C-terminal module, which is homologous to slit, a protein involved in development of middling glia and commisural axon pathways in Drosophila that may represent a dimerization domain or be involved in receptor binding. Although sequence homology between members of the CCN gene family is quite striking, functions of these proteins in vitro range from growth stimulation (6Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) to growth inhibition (23Scholz G. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Insights into the physiological functions and mechanism of action of this gene family are just starting to emerge. In particular, several lines of evidence support a role for the CCN gene family in tumorigenesis including reports that CTGF is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer (25Wenger C. Ellenrieder V. Alber B. Lacher U. Menke A. Hameister H. Wilda M. Iwamura T. Beger H.G. Adler G. Gress T.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), melanomas (11Kubo M. Kikuchi K. Nashiro K. Kakinuma T. Hayashi N. Nanko H. Tamaki K. Br. J. Dermatol. 1998; 139: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and condrosarcoma (26Nishida T. Nakanishi T. Shimo T. Asano M. Hattori T. Tamatani T. Tezuka K. Takigawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Angiogenic properties of CTGF are believed to contribute to tumor growth and vascularization. On the other hand, with other CCN family members, i.e. WISP1/Elm 1, expression is inversely related to the incidence of metastasis and growth of melanoma cells (5Hashimoto Y. Shindo-Okada N. Tani M. Nagamachi Y. Takeuchi K. Shiroishi T. Toma H. Yokota J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, inverse correlations have been reported between malignant phenotype and the level of CTGF expression in fibroblast and endothelial cell-derived tumors (27Igarashi A. Hayashi N. Nashiro K. Takehara K. J. Cutan. Pathol. 1998; 25: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Frazier et al. (28Frazier K.S. Grotendorst G.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported that CTGF mRNA was observed only in the stroma of human mammary tumors but not in the tumor tissue itself. Recent cytogenetic studies indicate that in human breast cancer, chromosome 6q23 is often affected by genetic changes, which suggests the existence of a putative tumor suppressor gene at this position (29Noviello C. Courjal F. Theillet C. Clin. Cancer. Res. 1996; 2: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar, 30Theile M. Seitz S. Arnold W. Jandrig B. Frege R. Schlag P.M. Haensch W. Guski H. Winzer K.J. Barrett J.C. Scherneck S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CTGF gene maps to chromosome 6q23.1 (2Oemar B.S. Lüscher T.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1483-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Based on the results of this study, it is tempting to speculate that CTGF might represent this putative tumor suppressor gene. Overall, it is clear that the CCN gene family plays a role in cancer biology. However, today it is impossible to establish a unifying function for these proteins in cancer cells. In the present study, CTGF antisense oligonucleotide, but not sense or scrambled oligonucleotides, reversed TGF-β-induced apoptosis. TGF-β has classically been considered to arrest growth at the G1phase of the cell cycle. More recently, it has been reported that TGF-β also plays an important role as an inducer of apoptosis in a variety of cells including cancer cell lines (31Choi K.S. Lim I.K. Brady J.N. Kim S.J. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In fact, apoptosis induced by tamoxifen (16Chen H. Tritton T.R. Kenny N. Absher M. Chiu J.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 17-19Google Scholar, 32Perry R.R. Kang Y. Greaves B.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), toremifene (33Warri A.M. Huovinen R.L. Laine A.M. Martikainen P.M. Harkonen P.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1412-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and estrogen ablation (34Kyprianou N. English H.F. Davidson N.E. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 162-166PubMed Google Scholar) in MCF-7 is associated with induction of TGF-β expression. Furthermore, treatment of MCF-7 cells with melatonin followed by all trans retinoic acids (35Eck K.M. Yuan L. Duffy L. Ram P.T. Ayettey S. Chen I. Cohn C.S. Reed J.C. Hill S.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (36Sathyamoorthy N. Gilsdorf J.S. Wang T.T. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2449-2453PubMed Google Scholar) also induced apoptosis accompanied by increased TGF-β expression. As mentioned above, CTGF gene expression is regulated by TGF-β (37Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar), and in vascular smooth muscle cells CTGF mRNA increased 20-fold over basal level after stimulation with TGF-β. Grotendorst et al. (37Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar) have recently found a novel TGF-β-responsive element with the consensus sequence 5′-GTGTCAAGGGGTC-3′ located between positions −162 and −128 of the CTGF promotor sequence. Point mutations in this responsive element resulted in a complete loss of CTGF induction. Therefore, CTGF is thought to be one of the downstream effectors of TGF-β (2Oemar B.S. Lüscher T.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1483-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In MCF-7 cells CTGF mRNA expression is normally undetectable by Northern analysis but is strongly induced by treatment with TGF-β, suggesting that in these cells, CTGF is a downstream effector of TGF-β-induced apoptosis. To clarify the downstream mechanism of CTGF-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, we examined the protein expression levels of Bcl2 and Bax. Bcl2 protein is considered a major factor in the inhibition of apoptosis in many human cancers (38Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 2261-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Ohmori T.

Yahalom J. Wieder R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) in MCF-7 is associated with down-regulation of Bcl2. Moreover treatment with melatonin followed by all trans-retinoic acids (35Eck K.M. Yuan L. Duffy L. Ram P.T. Ayettey S. Chen I. Cohn C.S. Reed J.C. Hill S.M. Br. J.

Cancer. 1998; 78: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) also increases TGF-β expression in MCF-7. Bax is a dominant negative inhibitor of Bcl2, and overexpression of Bax sensitizes MCF-7 to radiation-induced apoptosis (44Sakakura C. Sweeney E.A. Shirahama T. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Nakatani H. Tsujimoto H. Imanishi T. Ohgaki M. Ohyama T. Yamazaki J. Hagiwara A. Yamaguchi T. Sawai K. Takahashi T. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We now show that recombinant CTGF dose-dependently reduced Bcl2 but not Bax protein expression, suggesting that Bcl2 may represent a downstream target of CTGF in MCF-7 cells. Recently, Janicke et al. (20Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 21Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R.

Caspase-3 activity is thought to be essential for DNA fragmentation. In our hands, we also found that MCF-7 cells did not exhibit any caspase-3 activity (data not shown). Nevertheless, CTGF is capable of inducing DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that CTGF may utilize an alternative caspase pathway to induce apoptosis, i.e.caspase 6 or caspase 14 (45Samejima K. Svingen P.A. Basi G.S. Kottke T. Mesner Jr., P.W. Stewart L. Durrieu F. Poirier G.G. Alnemri E.S. Champoux J.J. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol.

CTGF showed no effect on cell viability at concentrations below 1 μg/ml in contrast to TGF-β, which has activity in the nanomolar range. We found that the minimal effective concentration of recombinant CTGF was 5 μg/ml in both MCF-7 cells (Figs. 5 and 6) and normal rat kidney cells (data not shown). We suspect that the recombinant CTGF protein used in our experiments has an overall low biological activity and that because of the cysteine-rich nature of CTGF (total cysteine content is 11%), the percentage of correctly folded and biologically active recombinant protein may be very low (2Oemar B.S. Lüscher T.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1483-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In summary, we show that CTGF is pro-apoptotic in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, and this effect is partly due to down-regulation of bcl2 protein. Furthermore, TGF-β-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells appears to be mediated by CTGF, suggesting that CTGF may play an important role in human breast cancer cell growth and may represent a new target for a therapeutic intervention."

CNC bZIP factors, together with small Maf proteins, bind as heterodimers to the NF-E2/AP-1 element. Similarity between the NF-E2/AP-1 element and the antioxidant response element identified in a number of promoters of genes involved in detoxification and antioxidant response raises the possibility that Nrf1 plays a role in mediating the antioxidant response element response. In this study, we exploited the availability of cells from Nrf1 knockout mice to study the role of Nrf1 transcription factor in the regulation of antioxidant gene expression and in cellular antioxidant response. Fibroblast cells derived from Nrf1 null embryos showed lower levels of glutathione and enhanced sensitivity to the toxic effects of oxidant compounds. Our results indicate that Nrf1 plays a role in the regulation of genes involved in glutathione synthesis and suggest a basis for a correspondingly low GSH concentration and reduced stress response.

Academic Press, San Diego1997: 107-114Google Scholar). A major source of ROS comes from cellular respiration when molecular oxygen is reduced to water in the mitochondria, from cellular metabolism of fatty acids, and from the respiratory burst pathway exploited by neutrophils and macrophages in the inflammatory response. Exogenous sources of ROS include chemical and physical agents such as UV radiation, environmental pollutants, and chemotherapeutic agents. ROS are short-lived and have diverse effects in the cell (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Cross C.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 598-620PubMed Google Scholar, 2Joshi M.S. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Dulbecco R. Encyclopedia of Human Biology. 4. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 107-114Google Scholar). On the one hand, they serve as key factors in the defense against bacterial infections, can stimulate cell proliferation, and serve as second messengers (3Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J.

On the other hand, elevated levels of ROS are highly damaging as they react readily with many cellular components resulting in damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins. Because of these damaging effects, ROS have been implicated in a wide variety of disease states including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, ischemia-reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, aging, and immune complex-mediated diseases (4Janssen Y.M. Van Houten B. Borm P.J. Mossman B.T. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 261-274PubMed Google Scholar, 5Knight J.A. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1998; 28: 331-346PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yu B.P. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). Cells have evolved a battery of defense mechanisms to protect themselves against damage induced by ROS. Maintenance of intracellular redox balance and metabolism of exogenous toxins are mediated in part by thiol-rich molecules such as glutathione and metallothioneins, and detoxifying enzymes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductases, glutathione S-transferases, glutathione peroxidases, heme oxygenase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. Essential to constitutive and induced expression of a number of genes that participate in the protection against oxidative stress is the antioxidant response element (ARE) (7Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The ARE, also referred to as the electrophile response element, is found in the promoters of a number of these genes (8Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19875-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

The ARE has been shown to bind a number of different transcription factors including basic leucine zipper proteins, AP-1, and other novel factors whose identities have yet to be identified (7Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 12Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors play important roles in growth and differentiation. There are several distinct subgroups of bZIP proteins, namely the AP-1, ATF/CREB, Maf, and CNC-basic leucine zipper families (13Blank V. Andrews N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 14Chan J.Y. Cheung M.C. Moi P. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Hum.

The CNC-basic leucine zipper (CNC-bZIP) family was identified from independent searches for factors that bind the tandem NF-E2/AP-1 like cis-elements in the β-globin locus control region. Members in this family include p45-NF-E2, Nrf1 (LCRF1, TCF11), Nrf2, ECH, Bach1, and -2 (16Andrews N.C. Erdjument B.H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H.

Although homologies among the different bZIP proteins are apparent in the basic and leucine zipper regions, the similarity between CNC-bZIP proteins is most remarkable in the basic-DNA binding region, suggesting that they bind the NFE2/AP-1-like recognition site with similar affinities (14Chan J.Y. Cheung M.C. Moi P. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Hum. Genet. 1995; 95: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, a stretch spanning 43 amino acids immediately N-terminal to the basic domain is highly conserved especially between Nrf1, Nrf2, and p45NF-E2. This region is also highly conserved in theDrosophila CNC protein and in the Caenorhabditis elegans Skn protein, but it is not present in Jun, Fos, or other bZIP proteins. This region has been referred to as the “CNC” domain. Whereas CNC-bZIP proteins have been shown to dimerize with the small Maf family of bZIP proteins, it is not known whether they indeed function as obligate heterodimers in vivo (13Blank V.

The human NRF1 gene was isolated as a result of our efforts to clone cDNAs, using a yeast expression system, that encode proteins that bind the tandem NFE2/AP-1 like cis-elements in the β-globin locus control region (18Chan J.Y. Han X.L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Nrf1 is widely expressed with high levels of the transcript found in liver, lung, heart, muscle, and kidney. To determine its physiologic role, we have used gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to generate mice with disruption in thenrf1 gene (28Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Hua R.H. Chang J. Yen T.S.B. Kan Y.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). nrf1 is an essential gene as homozygous disruption of it results in death in utero (28Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Hua R.H. Chang J. Yen T.S.B. Kan Y.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar,29Farmer S.C. Sun C.W. Winnier G.E. Hogan B.L. Townes T.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Homozygous mutant embryos have decreased definitive enucleated red cells, and as a result, these mice suffer from anemia and die in utero (28Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Hua R.H. Chang J. Yen T.S.B. Kan Y.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The red cell defect, however, does not appear to be cell-autonomous as Nrf1−/− embryonic stem cells contribute efficiently to blood formation in chimeric animals (28Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Hua R.H. Chang J. Yen T.S.B. Kan Y.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Whether Nrf1 regulates the expression of cytokine and/or other extracellular factors that play a role in erythroid maturation or red cell survival remains to be determined. The NF-E2/AP-1 element, also referred to as the Maf recognition element, has been shown to be similar to the antioxidant response element (ARE) (30Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14905-14960Crossref Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Based on the similarity of the NFE2/AP1 and the ARE sequence, one potential role of CNC-bZIP proteins is in the regulation of antioxidant expression. Whereas regulation of basal and induced expression of antioxidant genes are mediated in part by the ARE sequence, the identity of the ARE-binding protein(s) remains unclear. Members of the CNC-bZIP family and small Maf family of proteins have been implicated recently in mediating ARE function. By transfection experiments, Nrf1 and Nrf2 have been shown to up-regulate the human NQO1 gene promoter in HepG2 liver cells (30Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14905-14960Crossref Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Whereas Nrf2 knockout mice are viable (31Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1998; 91: 3459-3466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they were found to be impaired in the induction of glutathione S-transferase and human NQO1 gene expression (32Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). Thus, the Nrf2 knockout data provide further genetic evidence for a role of CNC-bZIP proteins in the regulation of ARE-controlled genes. As Nrf1 and Nrf2 share striking similarities in their DNA-binding domains as well as in their expression patterns, we hypothesize that Nrf1 also plays a role in the regulation of antioxidant gene expression. In this study, we examined this proposed function using mouse fibroblasts derived from Nrf1 mutant embryos. We found that Nrf1−/− fibroblasts have decreased glutathione levels and are hypersensitive to the toxic effects of oxidants. Glutamylcysteine-light chain synthetase and glutathione synthetase, genes in the GSH biosynthetic pathway, are down-regulated in Nrf1-deficient fibroblasts. The identification of glutamylcysteine light chain synthetase and glutathione synthetase as downstream targets provides important clues to the role of Nrf1 in cellular function and potential relevance to disease states. Isolation of mouse fibroblast from embryos was done using standard protocols (34Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Mutant embryos were derived from matings of Nrf1+/− mice described previously (28Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Hua R.H. Chang J. Yen T.S.B. Kan Y.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and from another knockout line bearing the β-galactosidase gene targeted into the nrf1 locus to be described elsewhere. Cytotoxic effects of various compounds were determined by either trypan blue dye exclusion or using a microtiter assay for cell survival. For cell survival determination, approximately 1–5 × 104mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were plated in 96-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% fetal calf serum. After overnight incubation, cells were then treated for 8–12 h with paraquat, diamide, or cadmium chloride. Following treatment, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% fetal calf serum for 1–2 days. The number of remaining cells was quantified by measuring the formation of formazan from MTS-tetrazolium (Promega) using a multiplate reader set at 490 nm wavelength. For direct quantitation of cell death, approximately 1–2 × 105 cells were plated on 24-well culture dishes and were treated as described. Following treatment, viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion. Cell morphology after drug treatment was examined by Diff-quick staining (Dade Diagnostics) of cells grown on chamber slides. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assays were done using ApoAlert Kits from CLONTECH. Briefly, 5 × 104 MEF cells were grown on chamber slides and were treated with various compounds as outlined above. After treatment, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 1× PBS solution, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X/PBS solution. Fragmented DNA in apoptotic cells was labeled at their 3′-hydroxyl ends with fluorescein-conjugated dUTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Labeling was performed in the dark for 60 min. The reaction was quenched in 2× SSC, and the cells were washed twice with 1× PBS. Cells were then mounted in Antifade (Sigma) with propidium iodide on glass slides. Labeled DNA in cells was then visualized by fluorescent microscopy. Approximately 1 × 106 MEF cells were trypsinized to generate single cell suspension and preloaded with 10 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFHDA) for 30 min in 1× PBS with 2% fetal calf serum. DCFHDA-loaded cells were then treated with 60 mm paraquat. After 4 h of incubation, propidium iodide was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml prior to analysis by flow cytometry. The oxidative conversion of DCFHDA to its fluorescent analog was assessed by the amount of fluorescent signal in live cells by flow cytometry. Detection of intracellular glutathione levels was done using GSH assay kit from Oxis International or according to the method described by Griffith (35Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3954) Google Scholar) from supernatants of approximately 1–2 × 107 cells. A fragment of 834 base pairs corresponding to −1096 to −253 nucleotides (36Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) of the human GCS light chain synthetase gene promoter was amplified using Pfu polymerase and then cloned into pCRBlunt (Invitrogen). The promoter fragment was then directionally cloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pGL3Basic (Promega) resulting in pGCSLpLuc plasmid. Nrf1 expression plasmid was constructed by cloning a 2.2-kilobase pair KpnI/XbaI fragment containing the human NRF1 cDNA into pEF1a-V5 vector (Invitrogen). Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were plated at 50% confluency a day prior to transfection. For cotransfections, equal amounts of the luciferase reporter plasmid and pEF1a-Nrf1 expression plasmid were transfected by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's protocol. Following transfections, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48–72 h prior to harvest for luciferase assays. Lysates were prepared according to manufacturer's protocol and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual Reporter system (Promega). Activity obtained from each sample was normalized for transfection efficiency by measuring Renilla luciferase activity derived from the pRL-TK plasmid included as internal control in the transfection and protein concentration by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). RNA extractions were carried out using Ultraspec RNA extraction solution (Biotecx). For reverse-transcribed-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers according to manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCR were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 pmol of each of the primers, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). PCR primer sequences are as follows: actin, 5′-ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG and 3′CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC; ARPO (acidic ribosomal protein P0), 5′-AGCTCTGAGAAACTGCTGCCTCA and 3′-CAGTCTCCACAGACAATGCCAGGA; GSS, 5′-AATGCGGTGGTGCTACTGATTGCT and 3′GATACACTGGACCACTTGGGCAGG; GCSL, 5′-ATGTTTTGGAATGCCACATGTCCC and 3′-GATACACTGGACCACTTGGGCAGG; GCSH, 5′-ACAAGCACCCCCGCTTCGGTACTC and 3′-CTCCAGGCCTCTCTCCTCCCGTGT. Aliquots of PCR reactions were sampled after various cycle numbers (empirically determined to maintain linear amplification range) and electrophoresed through 5% polyacrylamide gel. Band intensities were quantitated by phosphorimaging and were limited to samples in which amplifications were within the linear range. Quantitations were similar regardless whether ARPO or β-actin were used as internal controls. Control experiments in which reverse transcriptase was left out of the cDNA synthesis reaction step failed to show specific PCR products. In vitro transcription and translation of Nrf1 and human MAF (25Marini M.G. Chan K. Casula L. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. J. Biol.

Binding reactions were carried out in a mixture containing extracts,32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the antioxidant response element of human GCSL gene promoter (36Moinova H.R.

Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the DNA-protein complexes were resolved on nondenaturing 4% acrylamide gels. For supershift experiments, antibodies were incubated with the extracts for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of ARE probe to the binding reaction mix. Antibodies to Nrf1, Nrf2, p45-NF-E2, and p18-NF-E2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell extracts from mouse Hepa1–6 cells were prepared using the protocol described by Jackson (37Jackson S.P. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription. 117. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, New York1993: 189-242Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS prior to harvest by scraping. Cells were pelleted by a brief centrifugation and lysed by Dounce homogenization in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation, followed by extraction in a high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 6.25% glycerol). The cytoplasmic fraction was adjusted with 10% volume of buffer containing 300 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1.4m KCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The survival of MEF in different concentrations of oxidants was tested to examine whether a deficiency in Nrf1 would result in increased sensitivity of cells to oxidative stress. Fibroblast cells derived from wild type and Nrf1 null embryos were cultured in the redox cycling herbicide paraquat. A dose-dependent loss of cell viability was seen in both wild type and Nrf1−/− cells examined. However, wild type MEF cells were less sensitive to the toxic effects of paraquat compared with Nrf1−/− cells (Fig. 1 A). The concentration of paraquat required for 50% killing of +/+ and −/− cells were 0.6 and 0.2 mm, respectively. We also observed a considerable alteration in morphology of Nrf1−/− cells exposed to paraquat. Whereas wild type cells remained flat and adherent, mutant cells showed rounding and numerous cell-surface blebbings (data not shown) in addition to increased cell death (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether the cells are undergoing apoptosis, terminal transferase assays to detect nuclear DNA fragmentation were done. The number of fluorescent labeled cells before and after paraquat treatment was not appreciably increased in wild type MEF cells (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the percentage of labeled cells increased considerably in paraquat-treated Nrf1−/− MEF cells. Labeled cells were detected at even 0.6 mm concentration of paraquat tested. Nrf1 null cells were also tested with other oxidant compounds to determine whether enhanced toxicity was restricted only to paraquat. An increased sensitivity was also seen when Nrf1 null cells were treated with cadmium chloride (Fig. 1 B), and the decrease in viability was very pronounced with diamide treatment (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that Nrf1 null cells are more susceptible to various compounds known to cause oxidative stress and that cell death appears to occur via apoptosis.FIG. 2Morphology and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase labeling of Nrf1+/+ and Nrf1−/− fibroblasts treated with paraquat (A) and diamide (B). Left panels show Nrf1+/+ cells and right panelsshow Nrf1−/− cells. Mutant cells show increase in cell death and a higher proportion terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase labeling after paraquat treatment. Note the dramatic effect of diamide on the viability of Nrf1−/− fibroblasts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because cytotoxicity of paraquat is known to be associated with redox cycling and superoxide generation (38Krall J. Bagley A.C. Mullenbach G.T. Hallewell R.A. Lynch R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1910-1914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seemed reasonable to determine whether Nrf1−/− MEF cells accumulate higher levels of free radicals. To test this idea, intracellular oxidation of the reporter DCFHDA fluorescent dye was measured by flow cytometry. Basal levels of fluorescent DCFHDA formation in Nrf1−/− MEF cells were similar to that seen in wild type control cells (Fig. 3). This suggests that Nrf1−/− MEF cells were not under increased free radical burden compared with wild type cells under normal conditions. With paraquat treatment, there was approximately a 3–4-fold increase in fluorescence detected in Nrf1−/−MEF cells. In contrast, no increase in fluorescence was detected in wild type control cells. This result indicates that wild type cells were able to cope with the increased intracellular oxidative burden as a result of superoxide generation from paraquat treatment, whereas Nrf1−/− MEF cells were diminished in this capacity. Glutathione (GSH) is a major redox molecule found at high concentrations in all cells. GSH has numerous functions, an important one is to protect cells against ROS by means of its nucleophilic and reducing capacity. A decrease in GSH levels could result in a diminished reserve in intracellular reducing capacity resulting in an enhanced sensitivity to oxidants. Indeed, it has been shown that drug-induced GSH depletion in mice results in enhanced paraquat toxicity (39Nakagawa I. Suzuki M. Imura N. Naganuma A. J. Toxicol. Sci. 1995; 20: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To test whether Nrf1 deficiency has an effect on glutathione levels, GSH contents of wild type and Nrf1−/− cells were measured. GSH levels of Nrf1−/− cells were approximately half of control wild type cells (Table I), whereas oxidized GSH (GSSG) levels were not found to be different between control wild type cells and Nrf1−/− cells (data not shown). These findings imply that lowered GSH levels in Nrf1−/− cells were not from increased GSSG formation as a result of GSH oxidation under conditions of oxidative stress. One possibility for lowered GSH levels is that the synthesis of GSH is diminished in Nrf1−/− cells.Table IDecreased glutathione levels in Nrf1 −/− fibroblastsGSH levelsExp. 1Exp. 2Exp. 3Exp. 4μmol/mg proteinWild type0.0780.0450.0650.057Nrf1−/−0.051 (65%)0.026 (58%)0.038 (58%)0.029 (51%) Open table in a new tab The formation of GSH occurs by a two-step process catalyzed by the sequential action of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) and glutathione synthetase (GSS). The GCS holoenzyme is composed of two subunits as follows: a light chain, designated GCSL, bears a regulatory function, and a heavy chain, designated GCSH, is responsible for the catalytic function. As antioxidant response elements have been described in the promoter regions of both the humanGCS heavy and light chain genes, we examined the expression of these genes in wild type and Nrf1−/− fibroblasts. By RT-PCR analysis, the gcs light chain gene transcript showed a 3–4-fold reduction in Nrf1−/− fibroblasts compared with wild type fibroblasts (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were obtained by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, no significant difference in expression of the heavy chaingcs gene was detected between wild type and Nrf1−/− fibroblasts (Fig. 4, A andB). As expression of human GCS H andGCS L genes has been shown to be inducible after treatment with oxidants such as β-naphthoflavone (36Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 40Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol.

Although exposure of MEF cells to paraquat resulted in an increase of gcs L gene transcript levels, expression levels were reduced in Nrf1−/−fibroblasts compared with wild type cells treated with paraquat (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, the absence of Nrf1 did not abolish induction of gcs L gene expression. Levels ofgss gene transcript were also examined and were found to be down-regulated approximately 3-fold in Nrf1−/− cells (Fig. 4 A). Induction of GSH synthetase gene expression was blunted but not abolished in Nrf1−/− cells treated with paraquat (data not shown). Whether"

Recent studies have shown that Myc protein can transcriptionally activate the hTERT gene. However, little is known about the repression mechanism of the hTERT gene and telomerase enzyme. Here, we developed an expression cloning strategy to identify cDNAs whose products can repress hTERT promoter activity in telomerase-positive immortal cells. Using this screen, we isolated the Wilms' tumor 1 suppressor gene (WT1). WT1 can repress hTERT promoter activity in 293 kidney cells. The WT1 binding site on the hTERT promoter was identified by deletional analysis. Alteration of the WT1 binding site markedly derepresses transcription from an isolated hTERT promoter by inhibiting interaction of WT1 with DNA. These specific repression effects of WT1 were not observed in HeLa cells, which express no endogenous WT1. Furthermore, we show that WT1 can repress the endogenous hTERT promoter and telomerase enzyme activities. These results suggest that WT1 may be a transcriptional repressor of the hTERT gene, at least in some specific cells.

In the telomere hypothesis of replicative senescence, the lack of telomerase in normal somatic cells permits a shortening of telomeres with each cell division until the cells reach a point, termed mortality control point M1, at which they cease to divide. This limit can be overcome by inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (e.g. p53 and Rb), and the cells will again replicate and further shorten their telomeres until they reach a second barrier, the mortality control point M2. At this point, there is much genomic instability and most cells die, but in a rare cell the activation of telomerase can stabilize the chromosomes, and cell proliferation resumes. Thus, the maintenance of telomere length by the activation of telomerase is frequently associated with cellular immortality and may constitute a key step in the development of human cancer. The cloning of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)1 (5Meyerson M. Counter C.M. Eaton E.N. Ellisen L.W. Steiner P. Caddle S.D. Ziaugra L.

Expression of hTERT is sufficient to reconstitute telomerase activity in normal human cells and facilitate immortalization of some normal somatic cells (8Bodnar A.G. Quellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E.

Furthermore, it is induced upon telomerase activation during cellular immortalization and is down-regulated in correlation with telomerase activity during induced differentiation (5Meyerson M.

Thus, derepression of the hTERT gene may be directly linked to the activation of telomerase in tumor cells. Recently, the Myc oncogene product was shown to be involved in hTERT gene activation (10Wu K.-J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat.

However, little is known about the mechanism that can repress the hTERT gene or reduce the activity of telomerase. The existence of repressors for telomerase has been implicated by several studies (reviewed in Ref. 14Shay J.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To identify such repressors, we developed an expression cloning approach. This method identifies cDNAs whose expression can repress hTERT promoter activity in telomerase-positive immortal cells. We found that expression of the WT1 tumor suppressor gene represses transcription of the hTERT gene in 293 cells. The BAC library of human sperm genomic DNA was screened with a PCR-generated 0.2-kilobase pair DNA fragment corresponding to the 5′-end of the human hTERT gene (15Oh S. Song Y.-H. Kim U.-J. Yim J. Kim T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A series of deletions of an isolated 3396 bp of the hTERT promoter region was generated with polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion and then subcloned into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3-Basic (Promega) for reporter gene assays as described below. The WT1 binding sequence in the isolated hTERT promoter region was changed from AGCGCCCGCGCGGGCGGG to AGCGCAAGCGTTGGCGGG through site-directed mutagenesis (16Kim T.K. Hashimoto S. Kelleher III R.J. Flanagan P.M. Kornberg R.D. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The base changes were verified by DNA sequencing. Double-stranded cDNA was prepared by the SuperScript Plasmid System (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, NotI-oligo(dT)-primed cDNA that had been synthesized from poly(A+) RNA (5 μg) using human normal kidney tissues was size-selected by gel filtration and ligated toBamHI adaptors. This cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA1.1/Amp plasmid (Invitrogen), which contains the CMV promoter and the SV40 origin of replication. A portion of the ligation mixture was transformed into competent Escherichia coliMAX Efficiency DH10B cells (Life Technologies), making a directional cDNA library with more than 106 independent recombinants. The library was divided into pools of about 100 cDNAs per pool. Pools of plasmids were grown overnight in LB medium, and plasmid DNA was purified (Qiagen). Pools were transfected in 293T cells, which express the SV40 large T antigen, and assayed as described below. The DNA from the positive pools was transformed intoE. coli DH5α cells to generate fractionated subpools for further transfections. 293(T) and HeLa cells were transfected using liposome reagents (Fugene from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Lipofectamine from Life Technologies). To normalize transfection efficiencies, we cotransfected pRL-CMV (Promega), which expresses the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of an unregulated CMV promoter. A ratio of 100:1 was used for cotransfection of pGL3-hTERT:pRL-CMV promoter plasmids. The expression of luciferase reporter genes was analyzed 24–48 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Normalized luciferase activity refers to the ratio of relative light units of firefly luciferase to relative light units of Renillaluciferase. All transfections, except those for expression cloning experiments, were repeated at least three times; deviations are shown in the figures. Cell extracts were prepared, and telomerase enzymatic activity was measured with 20 ng of protein using the polymerase chain reaction-based telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP; Oncor). Total RNA was prepared with the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies), and an RNase protection assay was used to determine hTERT mRNA levels as described (5Meyerson M. Counter C.M. Eaton E.N. Ellisen L.W. Steiner P. Caddle S.D. Ziaugra L. Beijersbergen R.L. Davidoff M.J. Liu Q. Bacchetti S. Haber D.A. Weinberg R.A.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed (17Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) using double-stranded oligonuclotides containing wild-type and mutant WT1 binding site sequences, as defined under “hTERT Promoter-Reporter Constructs.” A DNA fragment encoding the DNA binding domain of the WT1 (−KTS) protein was subcloned into the pET25 expression plasmid (Novagen). Recombinant His-tagged WT1 protein was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3)LysS using nickel affinity chromatography (18Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To understand hTERT gene regulation, we isolated a 3396-bp promoter fragment of the hTERT gene from a human BAC library (15Oh S. Song Y.-H. Kim U.-J. Yim J. Kim T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To assay hTERT promoter activity, we fused the hTERT promoter to a firefly luciferase reporter gene and transfected it into 293 and WI38 cells. 293 is a telomerase-positive immortal cell line that has detectable hTERT gene expression, whereas WI38 is a telomerase-negative mortal cell strain that has no detectable hTERT gene expression (5Meyerson M. Counter C.M. Eaton E.N. Ellisen L.W. Steiner P. Caddle S.D. Ziaugra L. Beijersbergen R.L. Davidoff M.J. Liu Q. Bacchetti S. Haber D.A. Weinberg R.A.

In contrast, it supported high levels of reporter gene expression in 293 cells (Fig. 1, lanes 6–8). These differential hTERT promoter activities were also observed in other telomerase-positive immortal (HeLa, BHK, and HepG2) and telomerase-negative mortal (IMR90 and foreskin) cells. 2S. Oh and T. K. Kim, unpublished data. To understand the repression mechanism of the hTERT gene, we developed an expression cloning approach using the 3396-bp functional hTERT promoter. We prepared a cDNA library from normal human kidney tissues in which hTERT gene expression is repressed (5Meyerson M. Counter C.M. Eaton E.N. Ellisen L.W. Steiner P. Caddle S.D. Ziaugra L.

The library was divided into pools of about 100 cDNAs each and cotransfected into the 293T kidney cell line with a firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of the 3396-bp hTERT promoter. To control for variations in transfection efficiency, we also cotransfected a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase. Among 1200 pools (approximately 120,000 cDNAs screened in total), three pools (numbers 376, 727, and 1012) significantly reduced the normalized ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activities. Fig. 2 A shows one transfection experiment that included pool 376. Pool 376 was subfractionated into 30 subpools of approximately 10 colonies each, and two positive subpools (numbers 12 and 20) were identified (Fig. 2 B). We chose one of them (pool 12), and further fractionation steps yielded three pure cDNA clones (pools 72, 78, and 87; Fig. 2 C). Partial sequence analyses indicated that all of them encoded the WT1 (−KTS) protein without alternative splicing. WT1 has been shown to control genes involved in growth and differentiation of specific cells (e.g. kidney cells), and its inactivation may contribute to the tumorigenesis as a tumor suppressor gene (reviewed in Refs. 19Englert C.

WT1 mRNA is known to undergo alternative splicing at two sites. The WT1 (+KTS) isoform is associated with subnuclear clusters and splicing factors, and its function is uncertain, while the WT1 (−KTS) variant is present in the nucleus and probably plays the primary role in transcriptional regulation (reviewed in Ref. 19Englert C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 389-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To address the direct role of WT1 in hTERT gene repression, we attempted to identify its regulatory DNA sequences in the hTERT promoter. A series of deletions was made in the hTERT promoter fused to the firefly luciferase reporter. We transiently transfected these plasmids into 293 kidney cells, which express low levels of an endogenous WT1 protein. Hence, by analyzing the hTERT promoter in these cells, we eliminated the possible spurious effects of ectopic overexpression of WT1 (19Englert C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 389-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Deletion construct P-307, containing the 307 bp upstream of the hTERT ATG, produced a high level of promoter activity, comparable with that induced by P-3396 (Fig. 3). However, the level of promoter activity was reduced with a further 113-bp deletion (construct P-194), consistent with the requirement of the Myc site within that region for high levels of the hTERT promoter activation (10Wu K.-J.

Interestingly, the addition of 116 bp of additional upstream sequences to P-307 (construct P-423) significantly and reproducibly decreased reporter gene expression from the hTERT promoter (see also Ref. 24Cong Y.-S. Wen J. Bacchetti S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), suggesting that this 116-bp region may be involved in the transcriptional repression of the hTERT gene in 293 cells. DNA sequence analysis of the hTERT promoter revealed a potential binding site for the WT1 transcription factor between −307 and −423 (Fig. 3). This WT1 binding site (GCGCGGGCG) was also identified in the hTERT promoter sequences reported by other groups (Refs. 10Wu K.-J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 11Greenberg R.A. O'Hagan R.C. Deng H. Xiao Q. Hann S.R. Adams R.R. Lichtsteiner S. Chin L. Morin G.B.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 826-830PubMed Google Scholar; accession numbers AF097365, AF128893, andAB018788). To find whether the identified WT1 site is functional, we made a site-directed mutation of the putative WT1 binding sequence in the hTERT promoter. 293 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing wild-type (wt) or mutated (mt) WT1 binding sites. Immortalized 293 cells supported high levels of hTERT promoter activity (Fig. 4, compare lane 1with lanes 2 and 3). Under these conditions, mutation of the WT1 binding site, without any alteration in the length of the hTERT promoter, dramatically further induced reporter gene expression (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and3 with lanes 4 and 5). Importantly, this stimulatory effect was observed under the physiologically relevant setting of 293 cells, in the absence of ectopic WT1. These results suggested that the putative WT1 binding site is required for transcriptional repression of the hTERT gene in 293 cells. Next, we directly tested whether WT1 can bind to the identified regulatory DNA sequence in the hTERT promoter. We expressed the DNA-binding domain of WT1 (−KTS) in bacteria and purified the recombinant protein from the lysate. Purified WT1 protein efficiently interacted with the putative WT1 regulatory sequence from the hTERT promoter in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 5,lane 2). This WT1-DNA interaction was specifically inhibited by competitor oligonucleotides containing the wild-type (wt), but not mutated (mt), WT1 binding sequence (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). Consistently, this WT1-DNA complex formation was abrogated by the WT1 site mutation (Fig. 5, lane 7), which was shown to markedly potentiate hTERT promoter activity in 293 cells (Fig. 4). Thus, WT1 can specifically interact with the hTERT promoter, and the WT1 binding sequence is required for maximal transcriptional repression of the hTERT gene. The WT1 protein is expressed in the kidney, gonad, and spleen (19Englert C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 389-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Rauscher III, F.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 220: 151-162PubMed Google Scholar, 21Coppes M.J.

Genet. 1992; 1: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Haber D.A. Buckler A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 97-106PubMed Google Scholar). WT1 protein can be detected in the 293 kidney cell line, but it is undetectable in the HeLa cervical cell line. Thus, we expected that the mutant WT1 binding site would have no effect in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter constructs containing wild-type (Fig. 6,wt) or mutated (mt) WT1 binding sites in the hTERT promoter. The mutant WT1 binding site had almost no effect on hTERT promoter activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 6 A, comparelanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, this mutant WT1 binding site had dramatic promoter effects from inhibition of the DNA binding of the endogenous WT1 protein in 293 cells (Fig. 4). To further address the specific effects of WT1, we analyzed the response of the hTERT promoter to the ectopic expression of the WT1 protein in 293 and HeLa cells. As expected, the hTERT gene was negatively regulated by ectopic expression of WT1 in a dosage-dependent manner in 293 cells (Fig. 6 B,lanes 1–3). Under the same conditions, we failed to detect significant repression of the hTERT promoter by WT1 in HeLa cells (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4–6). Thus, WT1 can specifically repress the hTERT gene in 293 but not in HeLa cells. These specific repression effects were also observed in other kidney cell lines (e.g. COS and BHK). Taken together with the data from Figs. 4 and 6 A, these results strongly support the specific role of WT1 in hTERT promoter regulation in cells expressing endogenous WT1. We showed that hTERT gene can be transcriptionally repressed by endogenous WT1 in 293 cells (FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4 and 6). To assess this repression by WT1, the activity of the endogenous hTERT promoter was next examined in 293 cells (293-WT1), which stably overexpress the WT1 (−KTS) isoform (25Guan L.-S. Rauchman M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27047-27050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This established cell line was shown to overexpress WT1 at a moderate and physiological level, comparable with that of endogenous WT1 in HL60 cells (25Guan L.-S. Rauchman M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27047-27050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 293-WT1 and 293-Control cells, and RNase protection was used to compare endogenous hTERT mRNA levels. A larger amount of WT1 protein was associated with a markedly lower level of hTERT mRNA in 293-WT1 cells (Fig. 7 A). We also assayed the telomerase enzyme activities in these cells. Concomitant with repression of the endogenous hTERT promoter, telomerase enzyme activity was sharply reduced in the 293-WT1 cells compared with that in 293-Control cells (Fig. 7 B). Thus, WT1 can repress the activity of the endogenous hTERT promoter as well as telomerase enzyme in 293 cells. In the present study, we developed an expression cloning approach to identify regulators that mediate repression of the hTERT gene. WT1 was isolated as a potential repressor of the hTERT gene from a cDNA library, which was prepared from normal human kidney tissues. When WT1 was stably overexpressed in the 293 immortal kidney cells, it dramatically repressed the activity of an endogenous hTERT promoter and reduced telomerase enzyme activity. The same results were obtained with several other stable cell lines overexpressing WT1, discarding the possible involvement of clonal variation in the reduced hTERT mRNA levels. 3T. K. Kim, unpublished data. Importantly, this repression effect was specifically detected, even in the absence of ectopic WT1 expression, in 293 cells containing some endogenous WT1 but not in HeLa cells expressing no WT1 protein. Mutation of the WT1 binding site showed almost no effect on the hTERT promoter activity in HeLa cells, in contrast to its marked stimulatory effect in 293 cells. This specific repression by endogenous WT1 in kidney cells (e.g. 293, COS, and BHK) allows us to eliminate the spurious effects from the overexpression of WT1 that could be observed in the transfection experiments. Taken together, these results suggest that WT1 may be a transcriptional repressor of the hTERT gene in a cell type-specific manner. The possible involvement of WT1 in the repression of hTERT (and telomerase) is also consistent with previous results showing an inverse correlation between WT1 and hTERT/telomerase activity in differentiating cells. WT1 can function as a tumor suppressor gene that regulates transcription of genes involved in differentiation and growth of cells (reviewed in Refs. 19Englert C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 389-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Rauscher III, F.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 220: 151-162PubMed Google Scholar, 21Coppes M.J.

Genet. 1992; 1: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Haber D.A. Buckler A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 97-106PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, WT1 plays an important role in the differentiation of kidney and gonad cells. On the other hand, telomerase, in cooperation with other oncogene products, facilitates the tumorigenic transformation of human cells (26Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar). Furthermore, telomerase activity is down-regulated during differentiation, whereas it is induced in highly proliferating cells, including tumor cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Greider C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar and 2Nugent C.I. Lundblad V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1073-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Thus, WT1 may repress the hTERT gene during the differentiation of certain cells, and the loss of functional WT1 might contribute to the deregulation of its target genes during tumor formation. Interestingly, WT1 mutants activated rather than repressed expression of its target genes including the early growth response-1 gene (27Park S. Bernard A. Bove K.E. Sens D.A. Hazen-Martin D.J. Garvin A.J. Haber D.A. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, WT1 mutations with high levels of induced telomerase activities have been detected in many tumors including Wilms' tumor (28Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar, 29Shay J.W. Bacchetti S. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 787-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2418) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether inactivation of WT1 tumor suppressor gene directly facilitates telomerase activation by derepressing the hTERT gene during tumorigenesis. It seems likely that WT1 is not the sole determinant of hTERT gene activity. Several pieces of evidence suggest that there are inducers and additional repressors. First, microcell fusion studies identified multiple chromosomal loci of potential regulators involved in the mortality control, including repressors for telomerase (30Ning Y. Weber J.L. Killary A.M.

Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Second, the WT1 gene is expressed in specific cell types (e.g. kidney, gonad, and spleen); thus, other tissues probably contain other regulators to repress the hTERT promoter. Third, 293 kidney cells still induced some hTERT mRNA despite the presence of endogenous WT1 protein, although its DNA binding site is required for maximal repression of the hTERT gene; thus, some potent inducers (e.g. Myc) may be responsible for increased overall levels of hTERT mRNA in these cells and/or some other repressors may be also required for the efficient silencing of hTERT gene activity. And fourth, we identified additional repressors during our cDNA expression screen.3 Thus, in future studies, we will analyze the mechanisms by which multiple regulatory factors, including WT1, functionally interact to tightly maintain the repression state of the hTERT promoter in mortal cells. Furthermore, it will be important to analyze the mechanisms of how inactivation of repressors and/or activation of inducers can lead to telomerase activation in tumor cells. It is quite possible that complex patterns of hTERT gene regulation may occur in a cell type-specific manner, as suggested by the present study. Since telomerase activity is detected in most tumors, it may be possible to develop therapies that inhibit telomerase activity and thus inhibit the growth of many types of cancer. Combined with conventional treatments including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, anti-telomerase agents would limit the proliferative capacity of the rare surviving tumor cells and potentially prevent cancer recurrence. In addition, telomerase inhibitors could also be used as chemopreventive agents in persons with high cancer susceptibility or in early stage cancer to prevent overgrowth of metastatic cells. Thus, it is critical to elucidate the multiple signaling pathways (36Holt S.E. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 761-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) by which telomerase enzyme activity can be repressed and derepressed in cells. The present study provides some initial sights into one likely mechanism of hTERT gene repression by identifying WT1 as a specific repressor. In addition, the developed expression cloning approach will provide relevant targets that can be used for the specific modulation of the hTERT gene and telomerase activity for therapeutic purposes.

Both of these kinases are activated in cells by phosphorylation of a conserved residue in the kinase domain (Thr-308 of protein kinase B (PKB) and Thr-252 of p70 S6 kinase) and another conserved residue located C-terminal to the kinase domain (Ser-473 of PKB and Thr-412 of p70 S6 kinase). Thr-308 of PKBα and Thr-252 of p70 S6 kinase are phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)in vitro. Recent work has shown that PDK1 interacts with a region of protein kinase C-related kinase-2, termed the PDK1 interacting fragment (PIF). Interaction with PIF converts PDK1 from a form that phosphorylates PKB at Thr-308 alone to a species capable of phosphorylating Ser-473 as well as Thr-308. This suggests that PDK1 may be the enzyme that phosphorylates both residues in vivo. Here we demonstrate that PDK1 is capable of phosphorylating p70 S6 kinase at Thr-412 in vitro. We study the effect of PIF on the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate p70 S6 kinase. Surprisingly, we find that PDK1 bound to PIF is no longer able to interact with or phosphorylate p70 S6 kinase in vitro at either Thr-252 or Thr-412. The expression of PIF in cells prevents insulin-like growth factor 1 from inducing the activation of the p70 S6 kinase and its phosphorylation at Thr-412. Overexpression of PDK1 in cells induces the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase at Thr-412 in unstimulated cells, and a catalytically inactive mutant of PDK1 prevents the phosphorylation of p70 S6K at Thr-412 in insulin-like growth factor 1-stimulated cells.

The phosphorylation of two of these residues namely Thr-252 and Thr-412 on the longer splice variant of the α-isoform (Thr-229 and Thr-389 on the shorter splice variant) appears to make the most important contribution to the activation of p70 S6K (4Pearson R.B.

Phosphorylation of Thr-252 alone or mutation of Thr-412 to glutamic acid to mimic phosphorylation of this residue results in a small activation of p70 S6K.

The residues surrounding Thr-252 and Thr-412 of p70 S6K are highly conserved in all AGC family members, and phosphorylation of the residues equivalent to Thr-252 and Thr-412 of p70 S6K is necessary for activation and/or stability of these kinases in vivo (12Shepherd R.

Thr-252 is located between subdomains VII and VIII of the kinase domain, a region whose phosphorylation activates many kinases. The residue equivalent to Thr-252 lies in aThr-Phe-Cys-Gly-Thr-Xaa-Glu-Tyr consensus motif (where the underlined Thr corresponds to Thr-252 and Xaa is a variable residue). Thr-412 is located C-terminal to the catalytic domain, and the residues surrounding Thr-412 lie in a Phe-Xaa-Xaa-Phe-Ser/Thr-Phe/Tyr consensus motif. We (7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P.

Recently, we made the surprising observation that PDK1 can be converted from a form that phosphorylates Thr-308 of PKB alone (the residue equivalent to Thr-252 in p70 S6K) to a form that phosphorylates both Thr-308 and Ser-473 (the residue equivalent to Thr-412 in p70 S6K) through interaction with a region of protein kinase C-related kinase-2 (PRK2), termed the PDK1 interacting fragment (PIF) (22Balendran A.

In this study, we sought to identify the effect that PIF had on the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate and activate p70 S6K. Surprisingly, we find that, in contrast to PKB, PDK1 complexed to PIF can no longer phosphorylate p70 S6K in vitro. We also report that expression of PIF or a catalytically inactive mutant of PDK1 in cells prevents the activation of p70 S6K and its phosphorylation at Thr-412 as well as Thr-252, suggesting that PDK1 may mediate the phosphorylation of both residuesin vivo. The peptides used to assay PKBα (RPRAATF) (23Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and p70 S6K (GRPRTSSFAEG) (24Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen T.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and the peptides used to raise and purify the T412-P antibody were synthesized by Dr. G. Blomberg (University of Bristol, United Kingdom). Protein G-Sepharose, glutathione-Sepharose, and CHX-Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; protease inhibitor tablets were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, tissue culture reagents, IGF1, and microcystin-LR were from Life Technologies, Inc.; sensorChips CM5 and SA were from BiaCore AB; biotinylated reagent and secondary antibodies coupled to horse radish peroxidase were from Pierce. The phospho-specific antibody recognizing p70 S6K phosphorylated at Thr-412 was raised in sheep against the peptide SESANQVFLGFTYVAPSV (corresponding to residues 401–418 of the longer splice variant of human α-isoform of p70 S6K), in which the underlined residue is phosphothreonine. The antibody was affinity purified on CH-Sepharose covalently coupled to the phosphorylated peptide. The antibodies were then passed through a column coupled to the nonphosphorylated peptide, and the antibodies that did not bind to this column were selected. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the HA or Myc epitope were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; the monoclonal antibody recognizing GST was purchased from Sigma and used to verify the level of expression of GST-PIF in cells, whereas rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing the 18 C-terminal residues of PRK2/PIF were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. p70 S6K with a His epitope tag at its N terminus lacking the C-terminal 104 residues is termed p70 S6K-T2. To prepare wild type and the mutant 412E-p70 S6K-T2 the cDNA for these constructs was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the pMT2 vector encoding these forms of p70 S6K (6Weng Q.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-AGG ATC CAC CAT GCA CCA TCA CCA TCA CCA TAT GAG GCG AGC AAG GAG GCG G-3′ and 5′-GCG GCC GCT CAA CTT TCA AGT ACA GAT GGA GCC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were then subcloned into the BamHI/NotI sites of the pFASTBAC 1 vector, and this vector was used to generate recombinant baculovirus using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting viruses encoded p70 S6K-T2 or 412E-p70 S6K-T2 with an N-terminal hexahistidine sequence and was used to infect Sf21 cells (1.5 × 106/ml) at a multiplicity of infection of 5. The infected cells were harvested 72 h post-infection, and the His-p70 S6K proteins purified by Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography as described previously for PKBβ (25Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). They were then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmEGTA, 0.27 m sucrose, 0.03% (by volume) Brij-35, 0.1% (by volume) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, snap frozen in aliquots, and stored at −80 °C. p70 S6K-T2 or 412E p70 S6K-T2 were both recovered with a yield of 60 mg/liter infected Sf21 cells and were >90% homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. GST-PIF and GST-D978A-PIF were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and purified on glutathione-Sepharose, and the very small amount of endogenous PDK1 associated with GST-PIF was removed by immunoprecipitation with a PDK1 antibody (22Balendran A.

Phosphorylation of GST-p70 S6K-T2 by PDK1 was carried out as described previously (7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr.

The wild type GST-p70 S6K-T2, and the mutant T252A-GST-p70 S6K-T2, T412A-GST-p70 S6K-T2 proteins were expressed in 293 cells and purified as described previously (7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T.

The constructs used to express GST-PIF and the mutant GST-F977A-PIF (22Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr.

DNA constructs used in this study were purified from bacteria using the Qiagen plasmid Mega kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. 293 cells cultured on 10-cm diameter dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (by volume) fetal bovine serum were transfected with 2 μg of DNA construct encoding either wild type or mutant HA-p70 S6K or HA-PKBα and 10 μg of DNA construct encoding GST-PIF, GST-F977A-PIF, GST, Myc-PDK1, kinase-dead Myc-PDK1, or the empty pCMV5 vector using a modified calcium phosphate method (28Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell F.B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). 24 h posttransfection the cells were deprived of serum for 16 h and exposed to IGF1 (100 nm) for the time indicated. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (by volume) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmsodium β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 0.27m sucrose, and protease inhibitor tablets) and cleared by centrifugation, and 50 μg of protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. The protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by the Bradford method. The HA-p70 S6K or HA-PKBα immunoprecipitates were washed and assayed for kinase activity using the peptide Crosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG) as described previously for PKBα (28Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell F.B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). One unit of activity was the amount that catalyzed the phosphorylation of 1 nmol of substrate in 1 min. Cell lysates were made with 1% SDS, and the indicated amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using the indicated monoclonal antibody or the T412-P phospho-specific antibody (0. 4 μg/ml) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% (by volume) Tween, and 10% (by mass) skimmed milk. Detection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). p70 S6K-T2 and T412E p70 S6K-T2 mutant were amine-coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The indicated concentrations of His-PDK1 were injected over the chip at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, and the steady-state binding was determined in the presence or absence of PIF peptide. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) for the binding of His-PDK1 to p70 S6 kinase was determined by fitting the increase in steady-state binding upon increasing PDK1 concentration to a rectangular hyperbola using SigmaPlot 4 (SPSS Inc.). The measure of response in our experiments is termed RU; 1000 RU = 1 ng/mm2 of protein bound to the surface. PDK1 binds with submicromolar affinity to a region of PRK2 termed PIF (22Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). PIF is situated C-terminal to the kinase domain of PRK2, and the binding of this region of PRK2 to PDK1 is mediated by a consensus motif similar to that encompassing Thr-412 of p70 S6K, except that the residue at this position is Asp (Asp-978), rather than Thr or Ser. In Fig. 1, we demonstrate that PDK1, when complexed to either GST-PIF or a 24 residue synthetic peptide whose sequence encompasses the PDK1 binding site on PIF, was unable to phosphorylate GST-p70 S6K-T2 (a deletion mutant of p70 S6K that lacks the C-terminal 104 residues) in vitro. In a parallel experiment it was verified that PDK1 complexed to GST-PIF or the PIF peptide was able to phosphorylate PKB at both Thr-308 and Ser-473 to near stoichiometric levels (data not shown) as reported previously (22Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). GST-p70 S6K-T2 was used as a PDK1 substrate (Fig. 1) rather than the full-length p70 S6K, which is very poorly phosphorylated by PDK1in vitro (7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 8Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Truncation of the C-terminal 104 residues of p70 S6K is likely to be benign, as p70 S6K-T2 2 when expressed in cells possesses indistinguishable properties to the full-length protein as it is still activated by insulin and growth factors in a rapamycin- and wortmannin-sensitive manner (5Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 410: 78-82Crossref Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 6Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A.H. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). A mutant form of GST-PIF or the 24-residue PIF peptide in which the amino acid equivalent to Asp-978 in PRK2 is mutated to Ala (GST-D978A-PIF) possesses markedly reduced affinity for PDK1 (22Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, GST-D978A-PIF or the mutant D978A-PIF peptide poorly inhibited the phosphorylation of GST-p70 S6K-T2 by PDK1 (Fig. 1). If Asp-978 in the PIF peptide is mutated to a phosphoserine residue instead of an Ala, to restore the negative charge, the resulting peptide interacted with PDK1 with the same affinity as the wild type PIF peptide (22Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and prevented PDK1 from phosphorylating GST-p70 S6K-T2 (Fig. 1). To determine whether PDK1 could phosphorylate p70 S6K at Thr-412, we raised phospho-specific antibodies that only recognize p70 S6K phosphorylated at Thr-412 (termed T412-P antibody). This antibody did not recognize GST-p70 S6K-T2 that had been incubated with magnesium ATP in the absence of PDK1. However, following the addition of PDK1, which had either been expressed in 293 cells or bacteria, the GST-p70 S6K-T2 became recognized by the T412-P antibody (Fig. 2). Incubation of the T412-P antibody with the phosphorylated Thr-412 peptide immunogen used to raise the antibody (but not with the dephosphorylated peptide) abolished its recognition of GST-p70 S6K-T2 (see Fig. 3). The rate at which PDK1 phosphorylated Thr-412 (as well as Thr-252) of GST-p70 S6K-T2 was not increased in the presence of lipid vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (data not shown). PDK1 phosphorylated the T252A mutant of GST-p70 S6K-T2 at Thr-412 to the same extent as the wild type GST-p70 S6K-T2. The T412A mutant of GST-p70 S6K-T2 was not recognized by the T412-P antibody after incubation with PDK1/magnesium ATP. The 24-residue PIF peptide prevented PDK1 from phosphorylating the p70 S6K at Thr-412. A kinase-dead mutant of PDK1 was unable to phosphorylate GST-p70 S6K-T2 at Thr-412 (Fig. 2).FIG. 3PIF inhibits p70 S6K activation and phosphorylation at Thr-252 and Thr-412. 293 cells were co-transfected with constructs expressing the wild type (wt) full-length HA-p70 S6K (A) or the full-length HA-T412E p70 S6K (B) with either GST-PIF, GST-F977A-PIF, or GST. 24 h posttransfection the cells were serum-starved for 16 h and then stimulated for 40 min with 100 nm IGF1. The cells were lysed and HA-p70 S6K was immunoprecipitated and assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein from each lysate (10 μg for the HA blots or 20 μg for the T412-P blot) was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS/polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted using HA-antibody or the T412-P antibody. The T412-P antibody was incubated with either the synthetic peptide (10 μg/ml) corresponding to residues 401 to 418 of p70 S6K phosphorylated at Thr-412 (phospho-412E peptide) or the unphosphorylated peptide (dephospho-Thr-412 peptide). The T412-P antibody consistently recognizes a protein termed “nonspecific band” in cell lysates, which migrates at (75 kDa) derived from nontransfected and transfected cells. The intensity of this band does not change with IGF1. It is not co-immunoprecipitated with HA-p70 S6K (data not shown). The HA-p70 S6K activities shown are the average ± S.E. for a single experiment carried out in triplicate. Similar result were obtained in eight separate experiments (A) and two experiments (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The rate at which PDK1 phosphorylates Thr-412 is likely to be significantly lower than that at which it phosphorylates Thr-252.32P-labeled GST-p70 S6K-T2 phosphorylated with PDK1 was digested with either trypsin or V8 protease and then subjected to peptide map analysis on HPLC as described previously (7Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that the major 32P-labeled peptide containing ∼20–30% of the total radioactivity applied to the HPLC column corresponded to the peptide phosphorylated at Thr-252. Although several minor peptides were present in this analysis, which each comprised <5% of the total phosphate, we were unable to attribute any of these to a peptide phosphorylated at Thr-412. This analysis does not exclude the possibility that the recovery of the 32P-labeled peptide phosphorylated at Thr-412 may be poor but suggests that the stoichiometry at which PDK1 phosphorylated p70 S6K at Thr-412 is much lower than that which it phosphorylates Thr-252. To determine whether expression of PIF in cells could prevent the endogenous PDK1 from phosphorylating and activating p70 S6K, HA-tagged full-length p70 S6K (HA-p70 S6K) was transfected into 293 cells together with constructs encoding either GST-PIF, a mutant form of GST-PIF that interacts with PDK1 weakly (GST-F977A-PIF), or GST itself. The wild type or mutant GST-PIF and GST itself were all expressed at a similar level and were present at a much higher concentration than the endogenous PDK1 or PRK2 (data not shown). The cells were subsequently stimulated with IGF1 for 40 min (the time at which HA-p70 S6K is maximally activated) (data not shown); the cells were lysed, and the HA-p70 S6K was immunoprecipitated and assayed. Cells expressing HA-p70 S6K and GST exhibited a readily measurable basal p70 S6K activity in unstimulated cells, which was increased 10-fold in response to IGF1 (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, cells expressing HA-p70 S6K and GST-PIF possessed a basal HA-p70 S6K activity that was virtually undetectable, and IGF1-stimulation caused only a very slight increase in the HA p70 S6K activity (Fig. 3 A). In cells expressing HA-p70 S6K and GST-F977A-PIF, HA-p70 S6K was substantially activated by IGF1, although not to the same extent as in cells expressing HA-p70 S6K and GST (Fig. 3 A). This is probably explained by a weak interaction of GST-F977A-PIF with PDK1. As PIF inhibited p70 S6K activation in cells, we sought to determine the effect of PIF expression on the phosphorylation of p70 S6K at Thr-412 and Thr-252. We used the T412-P antibody to measure the phosphorylation of p70 S6K at Thr-412. These experiments showed that IGF1 triggered the phosphorylation of Thr-412 (Fig. 3 A). This was abolished by incubation of the T412-P antibody with the phosphorylated Thr-412 peptide immunogen used to raise the antibody but not with the dephosphorylated peptide (Fig. 3 A) or a phosphopeptide corresponding to the"
https://openalex.org/W2011710650,"Previous mutagenesis studies along with molecular modeling using the x-ray coordinates of the rabbit 15-lipoxygenase have led to the suggestion that the size of the substrate binding pocket may play an essential role in determining the oxygenation specificity of 5-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenases. Based on the x-ray crystal structure of rabbit 15-lipoxygenase, Ile<sup>593</sup> appeared to be important in defining size and shape of the substrate-binding site in 15-lipoxygenases. We found that substitution of Ile<sup>593</sup> with alanine shifted the positional specificity of this enzyme toward 12-lipoxygenation. To compare the importance of position 593 with previously defined determinants for the oxygenation specificity, we introduced small (alanine-scan) or large amino acids (phenylalanine-scan) at critical positions surrounding the putative fatty acid-binding site, so that the volume of the pocket was either increased or decreased. Enlargement or alteration in packing density within the substrate binding pocket in the rabbit 15-lipoxygenase increased the share of 12-lipoxygenase products, whereas a smaller active site favored 15-lipoxygenation. Simultaneous substitution of both large and small residues in the context of either a 15- or 12-lipoxygenase indicated that there is a functional interplay of the sequence determinants for lipoxygenation specificity. If the 15-lipoxygenase active site is enlarged excessively, however, no lipoxygenation was observed anymore. Together these results indicate the importance of the overall size and shape of the arachidonic acid binding pocket in defining the specificity of lipoxygenase reaction."

Brassica napus bnToc36, formerly named chloroplast inner membrane, chloroplast outer membrane protein of 44 kDa (Cim/Com44) or Bce44B (13Wu C. Seibert F.S. Ko K. J. Biol.

Conflicting results do not allow the clear assignment of the protein to either the inner or the outer envelope membrane, reflected by its name Cim/Com44 (13Wu C. Seibert F.S. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32264-32271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol.

Two Hsp70 homologues associated either with the cytosolic site, i.e. Com70 (16Kourtz L. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2808-2813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or the intermembrane face of the outer envelope membrane (17Waegemann K. Soll J.

A. 1990; 87: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), seem also to be involved in the translocation process. Subunits identified in the Tic complex include Tic110, Tic55, Tic22, and Tic20, however, their role in translocation is less well defined than for the Toc components. Tic110 might be involved in recruiting stromal Hsp100 or chaperonine 60 to the import site (10Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 20Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), whereas Tic110 domains exposed to the envelope intermembrane space could form translocation contact sites (22Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Tic55, containing a Rieske-type iron-sulfur motif, might act as a redox sensor to regulate import capacity of chloroplasts (24Caliebe A. Grimm R. Kaiser G. Lübeck J. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 1997; 716: 7342-7350Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Tic22 is peripherally associated with the intermembrane face of the inner envelope. Tic20 is an integral subunit of the Tic complex and is suggested to form part of the Tic translocation pore (5Chen X. Schnell D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Protein import into chloroplasts occurs jointly through the co-operation of both the Toc and the Tic complex (26Alefsen H. Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 144: 339-345Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). At least, a certain population of joint Toc and Tic translocation sites is present even in the absence of precursor proteins. It is not clear, if contact sites between the outer and the inner envelope membranes, which can be seen in electron microscopic pictures (5Chen X. Schnell D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Alefsen H. Waegemann K. Soll J. J.

Planta. 1997; 201: 119-127Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), are identical with or related to joint protein translocation sites. The isolation of either the outer or inner envelope membranes devoid of cross-contamination by each other is therefore not possible (29Cline K. Andrews J. Mersey B. Newcomb E.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3595-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Keegstra K. Youssif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Consequently, isolated Toc complexes from purified chloroplastic outer envelopes still contain the prominent Tic components and vice versa (20Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 23Lübeck J.

Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, important to establish the exact localization of a new translocon component. In this paper we report that a 44-kDa polypeptide from pea is abona fide component of the Tic complex. The 44-kDa polypeptide, which is a functional homologue of bnToc36, is exclusively localized in the inner envelope membrane. We propose to name the protein Tic40 but neither Cim/Com44 nor Toc36. The sequence ofBce44B (14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was used for a data base search. An expressed sequence tag from Arabidopsis thaliana (cDNA clone ATTS5476, accession number F15182) similar to Bce44B was identified and used as a template to synthesize a random-primed digoxigenin-labeled probe by polymerase chain reaction. A pea cDNA expression library (UniZAP XR, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with this probe, resulting in the isolation of a partial-length cDNA. This clone was used again as a template for synthesizing a homologous digoxigenin-labeled probe. Three full-length cDNA clones were isolated in a second screen. DNA cloning and sequencing of both DNA strands were performed according to standard procedures (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic pea DNA was isolated by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method (33Saghai-Maroof M.A. Soliman K.M. Jorgensen R.A. Allard R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 8014-8018Crossref PubMed Scopus (4145) Google Scholar). 15 μg of DNA were digested in 100 μl with different restriction enzymes for 4 h at 37 °C. After separating the DNA fragments on an 0.7% agarose gel, the DNA was transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with a 32P-labeled DNA probe. Pea plants (Pisum sativum L. var. Golf) were grown for about 14 days. Intact chloroplasts were isolated from leaves and further purified by silica-sol gradients (17Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After hypertonic treatment of intact chloroplasts in 0.65 m sucrose and 20 mmTricine, pH 7.9, organelles were ruptured with 50 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Thylakoids were spun down at 4000 × g. The supernatant was subjected to a further centrifugation at 200,000 × g, resulting in a membrane pellet that was used for separation of outer and inner membrane vesicles by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (30Keegstra K. Youssif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The supernatant contained all soluble proteins and was described as the stromal extract. The thylakoids were washed at least twice with 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, before further use. Labeled polypeptides were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation in a reticulocyte lysate in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine for 90 min at 30 °C (34Salomon M. Fischer K. Flügge U.-I. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5778-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Isolation of chloroplasts for protein translocation and the standard import assays was carried out as described previously (35Lübeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 6: 1279-1286Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Translation product was pretreated with hexokinase (Roche Diagnostic, Mannheim, Germany) and equimolar ratio of glucose to ATP in the translation mixture, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Futhermore, chloroplasts were isolated from plants at the end of the night and left on ice for 30 min in the dark to decrease their endogenous ATP level. Import competition experiments were carried out in the presence of heterologously expressed precursor of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit (preSSU) (2 μg/reaction) and with chloroplasts, equivalent to 10 μg of chlorophyll, for 5 min at 25 °C. To study intraorganellar targeting, import reactions were performed in 600 μl using chloroplasts equivalent to 400 μg of chlorophyll for 20 min at 25 °C. After recovering the chloroplasts from the import reaction by centrifugation through a Percoll cushion and washing in HEPES-sorbitol (17Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar) they were treated with 0.65 m sucrose in S-buffer (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and ruptured with 50 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The resulting solution was used for subfractionation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as above. A cDNA fragment coding for Met-128 to Pro-436 of Tic40 was subcloned into pET21b with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Overexpression was done in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Novagen, Madison, WI). After affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-agarose matrix Tic40-His-6 was used to raise a polyclonal antiserum in a rabbit. Preimmune serum was collected prior to the injection of the rabbit. IgGs of an antiserum (α) against Tic40 were cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose with 20 mm dimethylpimelidate (αTic40-protein A-Sepharose) (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 522-523Google Scholar). Inner envelope membranes equivalent to 6 mg of protein were solubilized with 2% SDS for 2 min at 95 °C. After diluting the SDS to 0.2% with IP buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) the solution was added to the αTic40-protein A-Sepharose column. The column was washed with IP buffer and eluted with 2% SDS. Inner envelope membranes equivalent to 200 μg of protein were cross-linked with 0.5 mm dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate (DSP) for 2 min at 25 °C and then 20 min on ice or with 0.5 mmCuCl2 for 20 min at room temperature. The DSP-cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. Envelope membranes were solubilized with 2% SDS for 2 min at 95 °C. After diluting SDS to 0.2% with IP buffer (see above) 5 μl of αTic40 were added for immunoprecipitation. IgGs were bound to protein A-Sepharose and the associated proteins were analyzed under denaturing conditions on SDS-PAGE followed by immunostaining with αTic110. We are currently trying to reconstitute the process of preprotein recognition and translocation as carried out by the Toc complex from heterologously expressed and purified subunits in vitro (9Hinnah S. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). As bnToc36 (13Wu C. Seibert F.S. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32264-32271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25623-25627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) is a putative subunit of this Toc complex, we wanted to clone and express its homologue from pea. A pea cDNA library was screened using a heterologous DNA probe of an expressed sequence tag from Arabidopsis, which showed strong similarities to bnToc36. Several but identical cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced. The open reading frame of this cDNA clone, peace48 (Fig. 1), (Accession number AJ243758) coded for a protein of 436 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 48 kDa (Fig. 1 A). The deduced protein sequence shows clear sequence homology to bnToc36 (54% identity, 8% similarity) (Fig. 1 A) not only within the published sequence (14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) but also in the sequence stretch, which was indicated as 5′-untranslated region in the B. napus clone (see Fig. 1), indicating that the native protein is indeed larger than previously thought. To resolve the question of where the N terminus of bnToc36 started respective of that of its pea homologue, an antiserum was raised against a heterologously expressed partial sequence, representing amino acids 128–436 of the pea protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). The authentic pea protein was then purified from detergent-solubilized envelope membranes by immunoaffinity chromatography containing the IgGs covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two proteins of an apparent molecular size of 44 and 42 kDa eluted from the affinity matrix (Fig. 1 B). Both proteins were sequenced. The amino acid sequence determined from the 44-kDa protein was XISSSNGQETTSVGV, which is identical to amino acids 74–88 of the deduced sequence of the 48-kDa protein. The amino acid sequence of the 42-kDa protein form was determined as VXPQLSPPPPST and represents amino acids 88–97 of the 48-kDa protein. From these data we conclude that (i) the 42-kDa form represents only a proteolytic fragment of the 44-kDa protein (see also below); (ii) the 44-kDa protein represents the mature protein, whereas the cDNA codes for a precursor form of 48 kDa. This notion is supported by the amino acid composition of the N-terminal 73 amino acids, which are typical for a chloroplast targeting signal, namely rich in hydroxylated amino acids and an overall positive charge (37von Heijne G. Nishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (see also below). Finally, we conclude that (iii) the cDNA clone coding for bnToc36 (14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Pang P. Meathrel K. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25623-25627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) does not represent a full-length clone. Because of the following results we will name the 44-kDa protein Tic40. The molecular mass number represents the calculated molecular weight of the mature protein deduced from peace48 and not its apparent molecular weight. The precursor form is called preTic40. Secondary structure prediction algorithms indicate that Tic40 contains a single transmembrane span (Fig. 1 C) within the extreme N-terminal region of the protein, consistent with its putative localization in the envelope membranes. This hydrophobic region is missing in the deduced sequence of the partial bnToc36 polypeptide. Earlier data had indicated that bnToc36 is coded for by a small multigene family (14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), because two isoforms of slightly different size were detected in immunoblots (13, 14, see also below). We, therefore, addressed this question by digesting pea genomic DNA with various restriction enzymes, and in a subsequent Southern blot analysis transfer restriction fragments were hybridized with32P-labeled probe of peace48. The labeling pattern (Fig. 2) is indicative for a single gene. Furthermore, we isolated four different cDNA clones coding for Tic40, partial and full-length, all of which contained an identical coding region. To verify that the cDNA clone peace48 indeed represents a chloroplast precursor protein, the polypeptide was synthesizedin vitro in a reticulocyte lysate system. The35S-labeled protein was incubated with isolated chloroplasts and either bound to the chloroplast surface or imported into the organelle in an ATP-dependent manner, as indicated by the appearance of a processed lower molecular weight mature form (Fig. 3 A). The processed mature protein was protease-protected inside the organelle, whereas the chloroplast surface-bound precursor remained protease accessible (not shown). The ATP dependence of import is indicative for translocation via the general import pathway into the organelle, whereas all nuclear coded outer envelope proteins use an ATP and presequence independent insertion route (for review see Ref. 3Soll J. Tien R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 191-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The only known exception to the above rule is the translocation pathway of preToc75 (38Tranel P.J. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Preproteins, translocating via the general import pathway, compete with each other for translocation sites. Therefore, we examined if import of labeled preTic40 could be competed for by the preSSU, a stromal protein, which was heterologously expressed and purified from E. coli and added to a chloroplast import assay after its denaturation in 8 m urea. In the presence of excess preSSU, the import of 35S-labeled preSSU and35S-labeled preTic40 translation product was completely abolished as indicated by the absence of the processed mature forms of both proteins (Fig. 3 B). Simultaneous association of the35S-labeled precursor forms of both polypeptides with the organellar surface increased. If this is a general effect remains to be established. Together our data indicate that Tic40 is indeed synthesized as a precursor protein, which is imported into chloroplasts by the general translocation pathway. Most consistent with these results would be a location in the chloroplastic inner envelope but not in the outer envelope, as proposed for bnToc36, which bound to the chloroplast surface in a largely protease accessible manner (14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), most likely because of the absence of the chloroplastic targeting signal and the transmembrane region. This notion is supported by our own observation, that an N-terminal truncated Tic40, which started at amino acid position 129, was neither imported nor bound to chloroplasts (not shown). To determine the subchloroplast localization of Tic40, we used three different experimental approaches. First, simultaneous protein translocation assays of preTic40 were carried out using labeled reference proteins of established chloroplast localization,i.e. the outer envelope protein Toc34 and the inner envelope Tic110 precursor protein, or the hybrid protein, Rubisco small subunit transit peptide-110N. Rubisco small subunit transit peptide-110N, which contains the Rubisco small subunit transit peptide fused to the membrane anchor region of Tic110 (110N), is translated, imported, and localized to the chloroplastic inner envelope with much higher efficiency than authentic preTic110 (23Lübeck J. Soll J. Akita M. Nielsen E. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4230-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and, therefore, was used here. Chloroplasts were fractionated after import into thylakoids, stroma, and inner and outer envelope membranes. Processed mature Tic40 was clearly enriched in the inner envelope membrane fraction (Fig. 4 A, lane 5) concomitantly with Tic110N. In contrast, labeled Toc34 was found predominantly in the purified chloroplast outer envelope membranes (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). No or very little labeled proteins were recovered either in the stroma or in the thylakoid membranes, respectively. Quantification of the import experiment, shown in Fig. 4 B, demonstrates, that more than 80% of mature Tic40 as well as Tic110N copurify with inner envelope membranes, whereas Toc34 is confined 70% to the outer envelope membranes (Fig. 4 B). This nonexclusive distribution between both membranes is consistent with the presence of translocon components in stationary joint translocation sites and the reported purity of enriched outer and inner envelopes from chloroplasts (29Cline K. Andrews J. Mersey B. Newcomb E.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3595-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Keegstra K. Youssif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Second, protein blots representing the protein complement of thylakoid membranes, soluble stroma, and inner and outer envelopes were decorated with an antiserum against Tic40, Tic110, and Toc34. The results show that Tic40 is almost exclusively detected in the inner envelope membrane fractions as is Tic110, whereas Toc34 is largely confined to the outer envelope membrane fraction (Fig. 5 A). The immunlocalization of Tic40 as well as Tic110 and Toc34 is consistent with the results from the protein import studies and strongly suggest that Tic40 is an inner envelope protein. When inner envelope membranes were treated either with 1 m NaCl or extracted at pH 11 (0.1 mNa2CO3), Tic40 was recovered with the insoluble fraction, indicating that it is an integral transmembrane protein (not shown). This experimental finding is corroborated by the secondary structural analysis, which predicts a hydrophobic transmembrane span in the N-terminal region of the 44-kDa protein (Fig. 1 C). The immunoblots show two immunoreactive proteins at 44 and 42 kDa apparent molecular mass in isolated envelope membranes. The lower molecular weight form is absent in rapidly isolated chloroplasts (Fig. 5 A, lane 1) (7Bölter B. May T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or in a protein extract obtained from pea leaves homogenized in liquid N2 and followed by immediate denaturation in boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer (not shown). Third, ultra-thin sections of pea leaves were immunodecorated using an antiserum against Tic40 and immunogold-labeled secondary antibodies. Gold grains were confined almost exclusively to the chloroplasts (Fig. 5 B). Within the chloroplasts, gold grains were confined only to the inner envelope membranes. The experimental evidence from three different experimental approaches point into a single direction. Accordingly, we conclude that Tic40 is a bona fideconstituent of the chloroplast inner envelope membrane. Is Tic40 involved in protein translocation? To address this question, cross-linking experiments were performed using either intact chloroplasts with bound 35S-labeled preSSU blocked from complete translocation (14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) or with inner envelope membrane vesicles using either DSP or the thiol oxidant CuCl2 (11Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,13Wu C. Seibert F.S. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32264-32271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After cross-linking of intact chloroplasts and complete solubilization of the membranes in SDS, cross-linked products were immunoprecipitated by an antiserum against Tic40 and analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and fluorography. A 35S-labeled high molecular complex was detected, which remained in the stacking gel of polyacrylamide gels (not shown). This result is consistent with the observation of Nielsen et al. (20Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) who describe the formation of a 600-kDa Tic complex upon cross-linking. Therefore, the nature of this complex was not further investigated. Next, purified inner envelope membranes were incubated with the thiol oxidant CuCl2 (Fig. 6,lower panel), which yields the reversible formation of covalent disulfide bridges between polypeptides that are in close physical proximity to each other or the thiol cleavable chemical cross-linking reagent DSP (Fig. 6, upper panel). After cross-linking, inner envelope membranes were solubilized in SDS, and proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antiserum against Tic40. Immunoprecipitated cross-linked proteins were cleaved under reducing conditions, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. αTic40 was able to co-immunoprecipitate Tic110 when cross-linked by either DSP or CuCl2 (Fig. 6), whereas in the absence of cross-linking reagent or precipitation, using preimmuneserum did not result in any significant co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6). Because oxidation by CuCl2 results in a reversible disulfide bond formation only when the thiol groups are in physical proximity, we anticipate that Tic110 and Tic40 are situated close to each other in inner envelope membranes. In this present work Tic40 was identified as an inner envelope-localized protein and a constituent of the protein import machinery. Tic40 from pea is homologous to a protein previously named Cim/Com44 from B. napus. Cim/Com44 was identified by its ability to form a chemical cross-link with a radiolabeled precursor protein trapped in the import machinery under conditions that allow only partial translocation but not complete import (13Wu C. Seibert F.S. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32264-32271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We were able to confirm and extend this observation in this study by demonstrating that the pea homologue of Cim/Com44, namely Tic40, is in close physical proximity to Tic110, a well established subunit of the protein translocon. After isolation of a cDNA clone coding for Tic40 from pea we noticed that the open reading frame was larger than that previously reported for the Brassica homologue (14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of the deduced amino acid sequence from the pea cDNA exhibited the typical features of a chloroplast-targeting signal. Import studies confirmed that the putative precursor form of pea Tic40 was actually imported and processed in chloroplasts by the general import pathway (3Soll J. Tien R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 191-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4May T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore the failure of the B. napusCim/Com44 translation product to import into chloroplasts is because of the missing targeting signal and probably led to its fortuitous adhesion or aggregation at the chloroplast surface in vitro(14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have used two independent experimental techniques to establish the cellular and subchloroplastic localization of Tic40. First, biochemical fractionation of purified chloroplasts into the different subcompartments either with or without the import of labeled and differentially localized markers, e.g. Tic110 and Toc34, indicated that Tic40 is predominantly present in the inner envelope. The currently available techniques to separate outer and inner chloroplastic envelopes only yield enriched populations of a single membrane (29Cline K. Andrews J. Mersey B. Newcomb E.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3595-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Keegstra K. Youssif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, the membrane “purity” might vary considerably (29Cline K. Andrews J. Mersey B. Newcomb E.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3595-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Keegstra K. Youssif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) but is around 80% (Figs. 4 and 5) for the preparations presented here. The second approach was immunogold labeling of ultra-thin sections from pea leaves. This technique excludes cellular fractionation and presents the antibody to a large variety of potential antigenes. This method is less prone to false positive results than if only a purified organelle is used for labeling or especially if labeling is done prior to fixation and embedding (14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,39Pain D. Kanwar Y.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1988; 331: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Again our data show that Tic40 is confined to chloroplasts within the plant cell and to the inner envelope of the organelle. Tic 40 seems sensitive to proteolytic degradation. In isolated inner envelope membranes as well as in chloroplasts after prolonged incubation a smaller breakdown product was detectable in immunoblots (14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein sequencing of this smaller polypeptide demonstrated that cleavage had occurred 15 amino acids C-terminal from the N terminus. Further proteolytic damage is most likely not occurring, because the single putative membrane anchor region of Tic40 starts shortly after the cleavage site (compare Fig. 1) and renders the rest of the polypeptide chain inaccessible to further degradation. A second smaller Tic40-like protein, as suggested earlier (14Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), is, therefore, not likely to exist. This notion is corroborated by the genomic Southern blot analysis, which provides support for a single gene coding for Tic40. What could be the function of Tic40 in protein import? When we compared the coding sequence of mature Tic40 with known protein sequences using the Blast algorithm, the only homologies observed were to Hsp70 interacting proteins from mammals (E value 7 × 10−7) (40Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The homology was highest in the C-terminal region with 40% identical amino acids between position 380–436. Hsp70 interacting protein forms a complex with Hsp70 and Hsp40. It regulates the ATPase activity of Hsp70 as a cofactor and functions as a molecular chaperone on its own (40Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 41Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Tic40 might, therefore, have a role in recruiting molecular chaperones to the inner envelope, which promote the movements of the precursor protein across the membrane (41Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). It was observed (15Pang P. Meathrel K. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25623-25627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that Toc36, when expressed from the plasmid Bce44B, which does not code for the putative membrane anchor present in Tic40, can complement soluble secretion protein A in a secretion protein A bacterial deletion strain in supporting protein export to the periplasmic space. The putative Hsp70 chaperone interacting function of Tic40 might be one possible explanation for its effect on protein export in bacteria. Experiments are currently underway to establish the interactions between Tic40 and molecular chaperones to establish its mechanistic role in chloroplast protein import."

The activity of the KATP channel, composed of SUR1 and Kir6.2 subunits, is regulated by intracellular ATP and ADP, but the molecular mechanism is not clear. To distinguish the ATP binding properties of the two nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs) of SUR1, we prepared antibodies against NBF1 and NBF2, and the tryptic fragment of SUR1 was immunoprecipitated after photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[32P]ATP. The 35-kDa fragment was strongly labeled with 5 μm 8-azido-[32P]ATP even in the absence of Mg2+ and was immunoprecipitated with the antibody against NBF1. The 65-kDa fragment labeled with 100 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the presence of Mg2+ was immunoprecipitated with anti-NBF2 and anti-C terminus antibodies. These results indicate that NBF1 of SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP strongly in a magnesium-independent manner and that NBF2 binds 8-azido-ATP weakly in a magnesium-dependent manner. Furthermore, the 65-kDa tryptic fragment was not photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C, whereas the 35-kDa tryptic fragment was, suggesting that NBF2 of SUR1 may have ATPase activity and that NBF1 has none or little.

Electrophysiological studies have shown that KATP channels are inhibited by ATP through binding to Kir6.2 and are activated by MgADP through binding to SUR1 (13Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C.

We have reported previously that mutations of either the Walker A or B motifs of NBF1, K719M, and D854N abolish the high-affinity 8-azido-ATP binding of SUR1, whereas the equivalent mutations in NBF2 do not affect ATP binding (15Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We have also reported that MgADP and MgATP stabilize binding of prebound 8-azido-ATP to SUR1 and that mutations in the Walker A and B motifs of NBF2 abolish this stabilizing effect of MgADP and MgATP (16Ueda K. Komine J. Matsuo M. Seino S. Amachi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These biochemical results suggest that SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP strongly at NBF1 and MgADP at NBF2 and that the two NBFs cooperate in nucleotide binding. However, due probably to the high-affinity ATP binding of NBF1, we have not been able to detect nucleotide binding of NBF2 directly. The ATP binding/hydrolysis properties of the NBF are best studied with MDR1 among the ABC proteins, and its two NBFs are proposed to be equivalent in function (17Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The covalent modification of the cysteine residue in the Walker A motif of either NBF has been shown to be sufficient to inactivate the ATPase activity (18al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J.

SUR1 photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[32P]ATP was digested mildly with trypsin. Tryptic fragments were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against NBF1, NBF2, and a C-terminal sequence of SUR1. The ATP binding properties of the tryptic fragments indicate that NBF1 of SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP strongly in a magnesium-independent manner and that NBF2 binds 8-azido-ATP weakly in a magnesium-dependent manner. It is also suggested that, although NBF2 of SUR1 may have ATPase activity, NBF1 has little, if any at all. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP were purchased from ICN. Hamster SUR1 cDNA was a gift from Dr. Joseph Bryan (Baylor College of Medicine). Membranes from COS-7 cells expressing SUR1, prepared as described (15Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol.

The reactions were stopped by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold TEM buffer, and free 8-azido-[32P]ATP was removed after centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min, 2 °C). Pellets were resuspended in 8 μl of TEM buffer and irradiated for 5 min (at 254 nm, 5.5 milliwatts/cm2) on ice. Samples were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. When membranes were incubated with 5 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the absence of Mg2+, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold TE buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 0.1 mm EGTA). After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in 8 μl of TE buffer and UV-irradiated as described above. Membranes were incubated with 100 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in 5 μl of TEM buffer containing 2 mm ouabain for 10 min on ice. Reactions were done on ice to prevent hydrolysis. Proteins were UV-irradiated as described above, and free ligands were removed after centrifugation. NBF1 (amino acids 695–934) or NBF2 (amino acids 1361–1582) of hamster SUR1 was fused with maltose-binding protein in a pMALc2 vector (New England Biolabs Inc.), and fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21. The fusion proteins were purified with amylose resin (New England Biolabs Inc.), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the purified proteins. Photoaffinity-labeled membranes were resuspended in TE buffer containing 2.5 μg/ml trypsin and 250 mm sucrose to 10 μg of membrane proteins/μl and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing 100 μg/mlp-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added to the samples to terminate proteolysis, and membrane proteins were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g, tryptic fragments were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with the antibody raised against NBF1, NBF2, or the C-terminal 21 amino acids of rat SUR1. It has been suggested that SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP strongly at NBF1 and binds MgADP at NBF2 and that the two NBFs of SUR1 cooperate in nucleotide binding (16Ueda K. Komine J. Matsuo M. Seino S. Amachi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, we have not been able to detect nucleotide binding to NBF2 directly due to the high-affinity ATP binding to NBF1. Because mild trypsin digestion of MDR1 or CFTR produces two large polypeptides corresponding to the N- and C-terminal halves (29Bruggemann E.P. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol.

When SUR1 was photoaffinity-labeled with 5 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and digested with 2.5 μg/ml trypsin, two photoaffinity-labeled fragments of ∼100 and 35 kDa were produced (Fig. 1 A). The amount of the 100-kDa fragment decreased, and the amount of the 35-kDa fragment concomitantly increased with increasing incubation time with trypsin. When SUR1 was digested with trypsin under the same condition, the anti-C terminus antibody recognized the 100- and 65-kDa fragments, but not the 35-kDa fragment, in immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the 100-kDa fragment is further digested to the 35-kDa fragment, which contains the high-affinity ATP-binding site, and the 65-kDa fragment, which contains the C terminus, as diagrammed in Fig. 2.FIG. 2Predicted diagram of limited trypsin digestion of SUR1. Mild trypsin digestion of SUR1 (180 kDa) first produces a 100-kDa fragment containing NBF1, NBF2, and the C terminus then produces a 35-kDa fragment containing NBF1 and a 65-kDa fragment containing NBF2 and the C terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine which NBF the 35-kDa fragment contained, polyclonal antibodies were prepared against NBF1 or NBF2 fused with maltose-binding protein. These antibodies recognized NBF1 and NBF2 of SUR1 expressed in E. coli, respectively, but scarcely recognized those of MDR1 (Fig. 3). The photoaffinity-labeled 35-kDa fragment was precipitated with the anti-NBF1 antibody, but not with the anti-NBF2 or anti-C terminus antibody (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3). These results indicate that the 35-kDa tryptic fragment contains NBF1 and support the possibility that the 100-kDa fragment is digested to the 35-kDa fragment containing NBF1 and the 65-kDa fragment containing the C terminus (Fig. 2).FIG. 4Limited trypsin digestion of SUR1 after photoaffinity labeling. Membrane proteins (20 μg) from COS-7 cells expressing SUR1 were incubated with 5 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP for 10 min at 37 °C and UV-irradiated after washing with buffer (lanes 1–3) or were incubated with 100 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP for 10 min on ice and UV-irradiated before washing with buffer (lanes 4–6). Reactions with 8-azido-ATP were done in the absence (A) or presence (B) of Mg2+. Membrane proteins were digested with 2.5 μg/ml trypsin for 60 min at 37 °C and solubilized with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The tryptic fragments were immunoprecipitated with the anti-NBF1 (lanes 1 and 4), anti-NBF2 (lanes 2and 5), and anti-C terminus (lanes 3 and6) antibodies and separated by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Undigested SUR1, a 100-kDa tryptic fragment containing both NBF1 and NBF2, a 65-kDa fragment containing NBF2, and a 35-kDa fragment containing NBF1 are indicated.

To investigate the ATP binding properties of the NBFs of SUR1, SUR1 was photoaffinity-labeled with 5 or 100 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of Mg2+. Proteins were then immunoprecipitated with the anti-NBF1, anti-NBF2, or anti-C terminus antibody after mild trypsin digestion (Fig. 4). The labeled 35-kDa fragment was precipitated with the anti-NBF1 antibody when SUR1 was photoaffinity-labeled with 5 or 100 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP either in the presence or absence of Mg2+. In contrast, the labeled 65-kDa fragment was precipitated with the anti-NBF2 and anti-C terminus antibodies only when SUR1 was incubated with 100 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the presence of Mg2+and UV-irradiated without removing free ligands. When membranes were washed with buffer before UV irradiation, the 65-kDa fragment was not labeled with 100 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP with Mg2+ (data not shown). These results indicate that NBF1 of SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP strongly even in the absence of Mg2+ and that NBF2 binds 8-azido-ATP weakly only in the presence of Mg2+. Less labeling of NBF1 with 100 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP on ice (lane 4) compared with that with 5 μm at 37 °C suggests that high-affinity 8-azido-ATP binding to NBF1 is temperature-dependent and that incubation at 37 °C is necessary. It also indicates that the 100-kDa tryptic fragment contains both NBF1 and NBF2 because it was precipitated with the anti-NBF1, anti-NBF2, or anti-C terminus antibody.

We have proposed that NBF2 of SUR1 has ATPase activity and that MgADP, either by direct binding to NBF2 or by hydrolysis of bound ATP at NBF2, stabilizes prebound 8-azido-ATP binding at NBF1 (16Ueda K. Komine J. Matsuo M. Seino S. Amachi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because it was possible to distinguish the two NBFs by their interaction with ATP by limited trypsin digestion, we tried to determine whether SUR1 has ATPase activity. Membranes expressing SUR1 were incubated with 50 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of Mg2+ for 10 min at 37 °C and UV-irradiated without removing free ligands. SUR1 was mildly digested with trypsin, and the tryptic fragments were immunoprecipitated with the anti-NBF1, anti-NBF2, or anti-C terminus antibody (Fig. 5). The 35-kDa fragment containing NBF1 was photoaffinity-labeled with both 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (lane 1) and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (lane 4). However, the 65-kDa fragment containing NBF2 was photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (lanes 2 and 3), but not with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (lanes 5 and6). These results suggest that γ-phosphate dissociates from 8-azido-ATP bound at NBF2 and that NBF2 of SUR1 may have ATPase activity. In contrast to NBF2, NBF1 appears to have little or no ATPase activity under the conditions examined. To demonstrate loss of the terminal phosphate from 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP bound at NBF2, we tried to show photoaffinity labeling of NBF2 with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP at time 0. Membranes were incubated with 50 μm8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of Mg2+ on ice and photoaffinity-labeled without removing free ligands. The 65-kDa tryptic fragment containing NBF2 was not, however, photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP even when the reaction with trypsin was done on ice, although the same fragment was photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (data not shown). In this study, we have determined that NBF1 of SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP strongly in a magnesium-independent manner and that NBF2 binds 8-azido-ATP weakly in a magnesium-dependent manner. We have also demonstrated that NBF1 has no or very little ATPase activity, whereas NBF2 of SUR1 may have ATPase activity. These characteristics of the two NBFs of SUR1 are quite different from those of MDR1: MDR1 has no high-affinity binding site for ATP; both NBFs of MDR1 hydrolyze ATP; and the roles of the two NBFs in drug transport are assumed to be equivalent in MDR1 (28Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). After hydrolysis, MDR1 is thought to form the metastable state MDR1·MgADP·Picomplex, and the phosphate ion is released before MgADP. When ATP is hydrolyzed in the presence of orthovanadate, orthovanadate binds to this intermediate in place of the released Pi to form a stable inhibitory complex, MDR1·MgADP·Vi (17Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Therefore, when MDR1 is incubated with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the presence of orthovanadate, MDR1 traps 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP and is specifically and strongly photoaffinity-labeled (15Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L.

Acta. 1998; 1373: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling of CFTR with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP has also been recently reported (32Szabó K. Szakacs G. Hegedus T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NBF1 of CFTR was preferentially labeled with 5 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the absence of orthovanadate. Because this high-affinity labeling of NBF1 is magnesium- and temperature-dependent, Szabóet al. (32Szabó K. Szakacs G. Hegedus T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) predicted that the nucleotide occlusion occurs in the ATP hydrolysis cycle of CFTR. The high-affinity labeling of NBF1 of SUR1 is also temperature-dependent (Fig. 4), but does not require Mg2+ (15Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a structural change (a nucleotide occlusion) might also occur in NBF1 of SUR1, but it would not be a step in the ATP hydrolysis cycle in the case of SUR1 because Mg2+ is not required. The addition of orthovanadate increases photoaffinity labeling and results in the labeling of both NBFs of CFTR (32Szabó K. Szakacs G. Hegedus T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but has no effects on photoaffinity labeling of SUR1 (15Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the catalytic mechanism of the NBFs of SUR1 may be different from that of the NBFs of MDR1 and CFTR. This is in agreement with experiments demonstrating that orthovanadate does not influence KATP channel activity (38Shyng S.-L. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 39Proks P. Ashfield R. Ashcroft F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25393-25397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To examine if NBF2 of SUR1 has ATPase activity, photoaffinity labeling of SUR1 with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP was investigated. However, we could not confirm that NBF2 of SUR1 has ATPase activity because the 65-kDa fragment containing NBF2 was not photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP even at time 0. This is probably because 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP bound at NBF2 is hydrolyzed, and the terminal phosphate is released during trypsin digestion. Recently, we found that NBF2 of SUR2A and SUR2B binds ATP in a magnesium-independent manner, and we could observe photoaffinity labeling of the 65-kDa fragment containing NBF2 with both 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP in the absence of Mg2+, but could not observe photoaffinity labeling of the fragment with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Mg2+. 2M. Matsuo, N. Kioka, T. Amachi, and K. Ueda, manuscript in preparation. These results support the idea that NBF2 of SUR1 and SUR2 has ATPase activity. In CFTR, ATP hydrolysis is important in channel regulation. Electrophysiological studies have suggested that both NBFs of CFTR hydrolyze ATP. ATP hydrolysis at NBF1 is predicted to be involved in channel opening, whereas that at NBF2 is predicted to be involved in channel closing (40Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 77-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 41Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Orthovanadate, which is assumed to trap ADP at an NBF, causes extreme stabilization of the open conformation of the CFTR channel (42Baukrowitz T. Hwang T.C. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 473-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 43Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19349-19353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MgADP, produced by hydrolysis of bound MgATP at NBF2 of SUR1, is thought to stabilize ATP binding at NBF1, and KATP channel activation may be induced primarily by the cooperative interaction of ATP binding at NBF1 and MgADP binding at NBF2 (16Ueda K. Komine J. Matsuo M. Seino S. Amachi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Accordingly, ATP hydrolysis at NBF2 could modulate KATP channel regulation. Because NBF1 was photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP, ATP is not hydrolyzed at NBF1 under the conditions examined in this study. If NBF1 of SUR1 showed ATPase activity under some other conditions such as by binding pharmacological agents or unknown endogenous ligands, the activity of the KATP channel would also be affected. In summary, we have analyzed properties of the two NBFs of SUR1 and determined that NBF1 binds ATP strongly even in the absence of Mg2+ and that NBF2 binds ATP weakly in a magnesium-dependent manner. It is now possible to examine the interaction with ATP at each NBF of SUR1. Because ATP binding and hydrolysis are important in the regulation of the KATPchannel, this study provides evidence of a critical part of the molecular mechanism of pancreatic beta cell KATPchannels. We thank Dr. Susumu Seino (Chiba University) for critical reading of the manuscript and providing the antibody against the C terminus of SUR1, Dr. Yoshitake Terano (Osaka City University) for preparing the antibodies against NBF1 and NBF2 of SUR1, and Dr. Joseph Bryan for the gift of hamster SUR1 cDNA."

This was confirmed by directly measuring the vacuolar pH by ratio fluorescence imaging. WhenΔvma yeasts were cultured and tested in the acidic conditions required for growth of V-ATPase-deficient mutants, the vacuolar pH was 5.9.

Similarly, internalization of the plasmalemmal H+-ATPase (Pma1p) was ruled out, because overexpression of Pma1p failed to complement the Δvmaphenotype and did not potentiate the vacuolar acidification. To test whether weak electrolytes present in the culture medium could ferry acid equivalents to the vacuole, wild-type and the Δvmayeasts were subjected to sudden changes in extracellular pH. In both cell types, the vacuoles rapidly alkalinized when external pH was raised from 5.5 (the approximate pH of the culture medium) to 7.5 and re-acidified when the yeasts were returned to a medium of pH 5.5. Importantly, these rapid pH changes were only observed when NH4+, routinely added as a nitrogen source, was present. The NH4+-dependent acidification was not due to efflux of NH3 from the vacuole, as cells equilibrated to pH 7.5 in the absence of weak electrolytes rapidly acidified when challenged with an acidic medium containing NH4+. These findings suggest that although NH3 can act as a cell-permeant proton scavenger, NH4+ may function as a protonophore, facilitating equilibration of the pH across the plasma and vacuolar membranes of yeast.

Rotstein O. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 179-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast and plants acidification of the vacuole provides the driving force for secondary transport of a variety of ions and metabolites (4Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2079-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5614-5617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sze H. Annu. Rev.

Considering the array of critical cellular functions that depend on the acidification generated by the V-ATPase, this enzyme would be predicted to be essential for cell survival. Accordingly, attempts to isolate Neurospora mutants with defective V-ATPase have failed repeatedly (12Bowman B.J. Vazquez-Laslop N. Bowman E.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By contrast, a variety of yeast mutants devoid of detectable V-ATPase activity (Δvma) have been isolated (see Ref. 10Anraku Y. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. 2. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1996: 93-109Google Scholar for review). Interestingly, such mutants are viable only when grown in rich media buffered to acidic pH. These V-ATPase-deficient mutants are unable to grow in media buffered to neutral pH (13Yamashiro C.T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Zn2+, or when glycerol is used as the sole carbon source (reviewed in Ref. 10Anraku Y. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. 2. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1996: 93-109Google Scholar). These observations suggest that acidification might not be essential for growth but are required only under stress conditions. Alternatively, when grown under rich acidic conditions, yeasts may possess additional mechanisms independent of the V-ATPase to acidify their endomembrane compartments. In this regard, it is unclear whether Δvma mutants can in fact acidify their vacuole. Flow cytometric determinations of vacuolar pH in Δvph1 (17Preston R.A. Murphy R.F. Jones E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7027-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and Δvma2 mutants (13Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) yielded values that are somewhat lower than those reported for the cytosolic pH of yeast (18Haworth R.S. Fliegel L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 124: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Carmelo V. Santos H. Sa-Correia I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Whereas the significance of this pH difference has not been ascertained, the existence of V-ATPase-independent methods of vacuolar acidification must be considered.Several alternative pathways for vacuolar acidification can be envisaged. Nelson and Nelson (15Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) proposed that yeast might acidify their endocytic compartments and, ultimately, their vacuole by fluid-phase uptake of acid equivalents from the external medium. In support of this hypothesis, Munn and Riezmann (20Munn A.L. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) found thatΔvma mutants were unable to survive when they were also defective in fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Alternatively, vacuolar acidification in Δvma mutants could result from internalization of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Pma1p), a monomeric protein that normally extrudes protons from the cytosol to the surrounding environment (21Serrano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar,22Nakamoto R.K. Slayman C.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If internalized in its active state, Pma1p might contribute to the acidification of intracellular organelles. Finally, when yeasts are grown in rich media at low pH, acidification of the vacuole may result simply from the passive leakage of extracellular weak acids, which could reach and dissociate in the endosomal or vacuolar lumen.In this report, we developed a sensitive microspectroscopic method to determine the pH within vacuoles of intact Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using this approach, we proceeded to compare the pH of vacuoles from wild-type and Δvma mutant yeast, and we analyzed the mechanisms underlying the partial acidification observed in V-ATPase-deficient mutants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Media2′,7′-Bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) was obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Bafilomycin-A1, concanamycin A, and concanavalin A were from Sigma. YPD medium contained 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone (both from Difco) and 2% dextrose.Strains and PlasmidsThe following yeast strains were used: BJ926, MATa/α trp1/+ +/his1 prc1-126/prc1-126 pep4-3/pep4-3 prb1-1122/prb1-1122 can1/can1 gal2/gal2; SF838-5A (Δvma4), MATα leu2-3,112 ade6 ura3-52 vma4Δ::URA3 (kindly supplied by Dr. T.

Slayman, Yale University) contains the full-length PMA1 gene preceded by two tandem copies of the heat shock element (23Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Growth and Labeling of YeastStrains were grown in rich medium (YPD) or minimal medium for transformed yeast as described before in Ausubel et al.(24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1992: 13.0.1-13.13.9Google Scholar). Buffered medium was prepared by the addition of 50 mmMES to either rich or minimal media, and the pH was adjusted to the indicated value with NaOH. YPD plates supplemented with 100 mm CaCl2, 4 mm ZnCl2, or buffered to pH 7.5 with 50 mm MES-Tris were prepared as described in Manolson et al. (25Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E.

Growth phenotypes ofΔvma and Δvma-YCp2HSE-PMA1 were assessed as described before (25Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after incubating the plates at 30 or 37 °C for 3 days for −Leu (pH 5.5), 100 mm CaCl2, and pH 7.5-buffered plates, and for 5 days for plates containing 4 mm ZnCl2.For vacuolar pH determinations, yeasts were harvested at 107 cells/ml and resuspended in rich medium containing 50 μm BCECF-AM and incubated at the specified temperature for 15–30 min. For measurements of cytosolic pH, the cells were loaded in rich medium buffered to pH 7.5. Yeasts were then sedimented, washed three times in rich medium, resuspended at 2 × 107cells/ml in the indicated synthetic growth media, and used immediately for imaging.Video Microscopy and pH ImagingPreparation of CellsFor imaging, 100 μl of the BCECF-loaded yeast suspension was plated onto glass coverslips that had been pre-coated with concanavalin A (Sigma) as described (26Johnson E.I. Capponi A.M. Vallotton M.B. J. Endocrinol. 1989; 122: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The coverslips were inserted into a temperature-controlled perfusion chamber (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY) and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100 TV, Zeiss, Germany). Image acquisition proceeded immediately after the addition of 1 ml of the appropriate recording solution to the chamber. Yeast pH was recorded in the synthetic growth media described above, as normal growth media, or YPD produced background autofluorescence.Fluorescence MicroscopyRatio fluorescence imaging was performed as described (27Demaurex N. Furuya W. D'Souza S. Bonifacino J.S. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2044-2051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), using a 63×/1.25 NeoFluar objective (Zeiss), a 75-watt Xenon epifluorescence lamp, and a shutter/filter-wheel assembly for wavelength selection (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Images were acquired on a 1317 × 1035 pixels cooled digital CCD camera running at 1 MHz (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). Image acquisition and excitation filter selection was controlled by the Metafluor software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Red illumination allowed concomitant visualization of the cells by differential interference contrast (DIC), using a separate video camera (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN).The bright fluorescence of BCECF at both excitation wavelengths (440 and 490 nm) and the use of high transmission objectives allowed to image the fluorescence of yeast vacuoles at the full resolution of the CCD array (i.e. no binning, pixel size 0.1 × 0.1 μm;e.g. Fig. 1). For statistical analysis, however, lower resolution images were used (4 × 4 binning; pixel size = 0.4 × 0.4 μm) in order to decrease exposure time and minimize photobleaching and possible phototoxicity. The 490 and 440 nm fluorescence images were corrected for shading to compensate for uneven illumination, and the background was subtracted and a threshold of 5 times the value of the background noise (root mean square) was applied before obtaining a pixel-by-pixel ratio of the two images. Sub-threshold pixels were neither displayed nor used for subsequent analysis to prevent artifacts caused by ratioing near-zero values.CalibrationAt the end of each experiment, a calibration curve of fluorescence ratio versus pH was obtained in situ by sequentially perfusing the cells with media containing 50 mm MES, 50 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose, 50 mm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), buffered at 4 different pH values ranging from 5.0 to 7.0 with NaOH as described previously (17Preston R.A. Murphy R.F. Jones E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7027-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Image ProcessingAn automated procedure was implemented to produce pH histograms or time graphs from the image data, using the pH-independent (440 nm) image to define individual cells. A small percentage of the yeast (<5%) had sustained cellular damage and displayed a bright fluorescence (>100-fold the normal intensity). These cells were excluded from the analysis by applying a high intensity threshold, whereas a low intensity threshold was used to define the edges of the vacuole. The image was then binarized, and the fluorescent objects were outlined by the computer (skeletonization). A size criterion was applied to retain only objects within ± 2 S.D. of the average size of yeast vacuoles. The average fluorescence ratio of individual yeast vacuoles was then calculated and converted to pH. This procedure allowed us to analyze an average of 20 yeasts per image, thus producing statistically significant information from images acquired within short (<10 min) intervals.ImmunoblottingYeast lysates from SF838-5A (vma4Δ) transformed with YCp2HSE-PMA1 were prepared by growing cells at 30 °C to mid-log phase and then shifting to 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 0.6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A together with an equal volume of acid-washed glass beads. Samples were vortexed 3 times for 30 s at 4 °C. Extracts were heated at 55 °C for 10 min, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 × g, at 4 °C. Equal amounts (50 μg) of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a monoclonal antibody against Pma1p (kindly supplied by Dr. J. Teem, Florida State University). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Acidification of defined endomembrane compartments along the endocytic and secretory pathways is essential for cellular function. Intraorganellar acidification appears to control vesicular traffic (1van Weert A.W. Dunn K.W. Gueze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) as well as receptor ligand dissociation within endosomes (1van Weert A.W. Dunn K.W. Gueze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Similarly, acidification is thought to be essential for protein degradation in lysosomes (2Creek K.E. Sly W.S. Dingle J.T. Fell H.B. Lysosomes in Biology and Pathology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 63-82Google Scholar) and for microbial elimination in phagosomes (3Grinstein S. Nanda A. Lukacs G. Rotstein O. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 179-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast and plants acidification of the vacuole provides the driving force for secondary transport of a variety of ions and metabolites (4Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2079-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5614-5617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sze H. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10113-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Acid equivalents are concentrated in the lumen of these organelles by active H+ pumping mediated by the vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase),1 an evolutionarily conserved multimeric enzyme (see Refs. 8Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 9Anraku Y. Umemoto N. Hirata R. Ohya Y. J. Bioenerg.

Considering the array of critical cellular functions that depend on the acidification generated by the V-ATPase, this enzyme would be predicted to be essential for cell survival. Accordingly, attempts to isolate Neurospora mutants with defective V-ATPase have failed repeatedly (12Bowman B.J. Vazquez-Laslop N. Bowman E.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By contrast, a variety of yeast mutants devoid of detectable V-ATPase activity (Δvma) have been isolated (see Ref. 10Anraku Y. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. 2. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1996: 93-109Google Scholar for review). Interestingly, such mutants are viable only when grown in rich media buffered to acidic pH. These V-ATPase-deficient mutants are unable to grow in media buffered to neutral pH (13Yamashiro C.T.

A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), in media containing high concentrations of Ca2+ (16Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Zn2+, or when glycerol is used as the sole carbon source (reviewed in Ref. 10Anraku Y. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. 2. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1996: 93-109Google Scholar). These observations suggest that acidification might not be essential for growth but are required only under stress conditions. Alternatively, when grown under rich acidic conditions, yeasts may possess additional mechanisms independent of the V-ATPase to acidify their endomembrane compartments. In this regard, it is unclear whether Δvma mutants can in fact acidify their vacuole. Flow cytometric determinations of vacuolar pH in Δvph1 (17Preston R.A. Murphy R.F. Jones E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7027-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and Δvma2 mutants (13Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) yielded values that are somewhat lower than those reported for the cytosolic pH of yeast (18Haworth R.S. Fliegel L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 124: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Carmelo V. Santos H. Sa-Correia I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Whereas the significance of this pH difference has not been ascertained, the existence of V-ATPase-independent methods of vacuolar acidification must be considered. Several alternative pathways for vacuolar acidification can be envisaged. Nelson and Nelson (15Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) proposed that yeast might acidify their endocytic compartments and, ultimately, their vacuole by fluid-phase uptake of acid equivalents from the external medium. In support of this hypothesis, Munn and Riezmann (20Munn A.L. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) found thatΔvma mutants were unable to survive when they were also defective in fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Alternatively, vacuolar acidification in Δvma mutants could result from internalization of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Pma1p), a monomeric protein that normally extrudes protons from the cytosol to the surrounding environment (21Serrano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar,22Nakamoto R.K. Slayman C.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If internalized in its active state, Pma1p might contribute to the acidification of intracellular organelles. Finally, when yeasts are grown in rich media at low pH, acidification of the vacuole may result simply from the passive leakage of extracellular weak acids, which could reach and dissociate in the endosomal or vacuolar lumen. In this report, we developed a sensitive microspectroscopic method to determine the pH within vacuoles of intact Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using this approach, we proceeded to compare the pH of vacuoles from wild-type and Δvma mutant yeast, and we analyzed the mechanisms underlying the partial acidification observed in V-ATPase-deficient mutants. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Media2′,7′-Bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) was obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Bafilomycin-A1, concanamycin A, and concanavalin A were from Sigma. YPD medium contained 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone (both from Difco) and 2% dextrose.Strains and PlasmidsThe following yeast strains were used: BJ926, MATa/α trp1/+ +/his1 prc1-126/prc1-126 pep4-3/pep4-3 prb1-1122/prb1-1122 can1/can1 gal2/gal2; SF838-5A (Δvma4), MATα leu2-3,112 ade6 ura3-52 vma4Δ::URA3 (kindly supplied by Dr. T. Stevens, University of Oregon); RH268-1C, MATa, end4, ura3, leu2 his4, bar1-1 (kindly supplied by Dr. H. Riezman, University of Basel). The plasmid YCp2HSE-PMA1 (kindly provided to us by Dr. C. Slayman, Yale University) contains the full-length PMA1 gene preceded by two tandem copies of the heat shock element (23Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol.

Buffered medium was prepared by the addition of 50 mmMES to either rich or minimal media, and the pH was adjusted to the indicated value with NaOH. YPD plates supplemented with 100 mm CaCl2, 4 mm ZnCl2, or buffered to pH 7.5 with 50 mm MES-Tris were prepared as described in Manolson et al. (25Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E.

For measurements of cytosolic pH, the cells were loaded in rich medium buffered to pH 7.5. Yeasts were then sedimented, washed three times in rich medium, resuspended at 2 × 107cells/ml in the indicated synthetic growth media, and used immediately for imaging.Video Microscopy and pH ImagingPreparation of CellsFor imaging, 100 μl of the BCECF-loaded yeast suspension was plated onto glass coverslips that had been pre-coated with concanavalin A (Sigma) as described (26Johnson E.I. Capponi A.M. Vallotton M.B. J. Endocrinol. 1989; 122: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The coverslips were inserted into a temperature-controlled perfusion chamber (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY) and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100 TV, Zeiss, Germany). Image acquisition proceeded immediately after the addition of 1 ml of the appropriate recording solution to the chamber. Yeast pH was recorded in the synthetic growth media described above, as normal growth media, or YPD produced background autofluorescence.Fluorescence MicroscopyRatio fluorescence imaging was performed as described (27Demaurex N.

The ABO gene promoter region contains a CpG island whose methylation status correlates well with gene expression in the cell lines tested. The CpG island was found hypomethylated in some cell lines that expressed ABO genes, whereas the other cell lines that did not express ABO genes were hypermethylated. Whereas constitutive transcriptional activity of the ABO gene promoter was demonstrated in both expressor and nonexpressor cell lines by transient transfection of reporter constructs containing the ABO gene promoter sequence, HhaI methylase-catalyzed in vitro methylation of the promoter region prior to DNA transfection suppressed the promoter activity when introduced into the expressor gastric cancer cell line KATOIII cells. On the other hand, in the nonexpressor gastric cancer cell line MKN28 cells, treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine resulted in demethylation of the ABO gene promoter and appearance of A-transferase messages, as well as A-antigens synthesized by A-transferase. Taken together, these studies suggest that DNA methylation of the ABO gene promoter may play an important role in the regulation of ABO gene expression.

Zentbl. Bakt. Parasitkde ( Abt. ). 1900; 27: 357-363Google Scholar) at the beginning of this century is of great importance in blood transfusions and organ transplantations. Two carbohydrate antigens, A- and B-antigens, and their antibodies constitute this system. The A and B functional alleles at the ABO genetic locus encode glycosyltransferases α1→3GalNAc transferase (designated A-transferase) and α1→3Gal transferase (designated B-transferase), respectively. A-transferase transfers a GalNAc residue from UDP-GalNAc to the precursor H substrate, producing A antigens as defined by the trisaccharide determinant structure, GalNAcα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→R. Similarly, B-transferase catalyzes the transfer of a Gal from UDP-Gal to the same H substrate, producing B antigens defined by Galα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→R (2Morgan W.T.J. Watkins W.M. Br. Med.

Molecular genetic studies of the human ABO genes have identified two critical single base substitutions that result in amino acid substitutions responsible for the different donor nucleotide-sugar substrate specificity between A- and B-transferases. A single base deletion, which shifts the reading frame of codons and abolishes the function of A-transferase, has been identified in most O alleles (6Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar,7Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ABO genes are expressed in a cell type-specific manner; the isoantigens A, B, and H of blood groups A, B, and O are not confined to red cells only but are also found in most secretions and on some epithelial cells. However, they are absent in connective tissues and the central nervous system (8Race R.R. Sanger R. Blood Groups in Man. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1975: 8-91Google Scholar). ABH antigens are known to undergo drastic changes during development, differentiation, and maturation of normal cells (9Dabelsteen E. Vedtofte P. Hakomori S. Young W.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 79: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition to these physiological processes, profound changes have also been documented in pathological processes such as tumorigenesis. Reduction or complete deletion of A/B antigen expression in bladder and oral cancers has been documented, as well as the apparent onco-developmental expression of the ABH antigens in gastric and distal colon tumors (10Cordón-Cardó C.

Moreover, the loss of ABH antigens has been correlated with tumor progression of various carcinomas including lung and bladder carcinomas (13Lee J.S. Ro J.Y. Sahin A.A. Hong W.K. Brown B.W.

Thus, delineation of regulatory mechanism is essential to understand these complicated expression patterns of the ABO genes. In an initial attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanism controlling the expression of the human ABO genes, we isolated several genomic clones that covered the ABO genes over 18 kb1 (17Yamamoto F. McNill P.D. Hakomori S. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A 4.7-kbEcoRI/NcoI 5′-upstream fragment flanking the coding sequence in exon 1 of the human ABO gene was subcloned into the promoterless pGL3-basic vector upstream of the luciferase coding sequence, and a series of nested deletion constructs were prepared. Transient transfection assays were performed to analyze the promoter activity of the respective constructs using gastric cancer cell line KATOIII as the recipient of DNA. Results demonstrated that the sequence just upstream of the transcription start site was responsible for the transcriptional activity of the ABO genes (18Kominato Y. Tsuchiya T. Hata N. Takizawa H. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25890-25898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Inspection of the promoter region revealed the presence of several GC boxes just upstream of the transcription initiation sites. However, no sequence motifs were found for tissue-specific DNA-binding proteins. Thus, there should be additional controlling mechanism(s) to account for the expression patterns of the human ABO genes. Methylation of cytosine residues in the dinucleotide CpG may offer one such mechanism because it is well known to control cell type-specific transcriptional regulation in various other genes, includingmyo-D gene (19Rideout III, W.M. Evesole-Cire P. Spruck C.H. Hustad C.M. Coetzee G.A. Gonzales F.A. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6143-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CpG island hypermethylation has often been found to be associated with transcriptional inactivation of specific tumor suppressor genes in neoplastic cells (20Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.-P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have investigated the possible role of DNA methylation in the ABO gene expression. Human gastric cancer cell lines MKN28 (JCRB0253) and MKN45 (JCRB0254), erythroleukemic cell lines K562 (JCRB0019) and HEL (JCRB0062), and T cell line Jurkat (RCB0806) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin. A human gastric cancer cell line KATOIII (JCRB0611) was grown in 45% RPMI 1640 plus 45% minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% FBS and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin. A human glioblastoma cell line T98G (JCRB9041) was grown in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 μm nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the acid guanidine thiocyanate/acid phenol method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (2 μg) using random hexamers and Superscript II (Life Technologies, inc.). One μl out of 20 μl of the resulting single strand cDNA reaction was used as a template for RT-PCR. Five μl of Marathon-Ready cDNA of human bone marrow (CLONTECH) was also used as a template for PCR. The sequences of the primers used to amplify the ABO gene messages were 5′-CCAGAAGTCTAATGCCAGGAAGCCTGGAAC-3′ (sense primer, ABO+116) and 5′-CCCCCAGGTAGTAGAAATCGCCCTCGTCCTT-3′ (antisense primer, ABO+802), and they corresponded to the sequences located in exons 3 and 7 of the gene, respectively. Primer ABO+802 is identical to the ABO80 primer reported by Ørntoft et al. (22Ørntoft T.F. Meldgaard P. Pedersen B. Wolf H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1031-1036PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions for ABO amplification were 95 °C for 9 min, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 63 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. RT-PCR was also performed using primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) gene messages as a control. Primers for the G3PDH gene were 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GACCACAGTCCATGACATCACT-3′ (antisense). Conditions for G3PDH amplification were 95 °C for 9 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. Both PCR amplifications were performed in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 20 pmol of each primer, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin-Elmer), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 150 μm dNTP, and 1× buffer (Perkin-Elmer). The products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel. The identity of the ABO cDNA was confirmed by sequencing and Southern blot hybridization. After cloning of the PCR-amplified products into a pCR2.1 plasmid vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), sequence was determined using the ABI PRISM dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase FS (Perkin-Elmer) with both M13 forward and reverse primers. For Southern blot analysis, the PCR-amplified products resolved on a 2% agarose gel were transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probe was prepared by a PCR amplification method using the EcoRI-digestive fragment from a plasmid pAAAA (7Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. In order to label the probe, [32P]dATP was used in place of nonradioactive dATP in the PCR reaction. The primers used for amplification were ABO+802 and ABO+415, 5′-CGGAATTCAAGCACTTCATGGTGGGCCA-3′. The amplification was performed under the following conditions: 95 °C for 9 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, followed by incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. The reaction was carried out in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 100 pmol of each primer, 5 units of AmpliTaq Gold, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 150 μm dNTP, and 1× buffer. The ABO blot was prehybridized in 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5% SDS solution at 65 °C for 1 h and then hybridized overnight at 65 °C with the32P-labeled A-transferase cDNA sequence probe. The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSPE and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, three times in 1× SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 2 h, and then once in 0.1× SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h, followed by autoradiography. Bisulfite genomic sequencing was performed as described by Clark et al. (23Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar) under conditions that allowed the conversion of cytosine, but not 5-methylcytosine, to uracil. Briefly, DNA (200–400 ng) in a volume of 20 μl was denatured by NaOH (final concentration, 0.3m) for 15 min at 75 °C. Freshly prepared 14 μl of 10 mm hydroquinone (Sigma) and 250 μl of 4.8 msodium metabisulfite (Sigma) at pH 5.0 were added and mixed. The samples were then incubated under mineral oil at 55 °C for 16–20 h. Modified DNA was purified using the Glassmax DNA isolation spin cartridge system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Modification was completed by NaOH (final concentration, 0.3 m) treatment for 5 min at room temperature, followed by ethanol precipitation. DNA was resuspended in water and used immediately or stored at −20 °C. Because methylation of cytosine residue in CpG dinucleotide appears symmetrical on either strand of DNA, the upper strand of the bisulfite-modified ABO promoter was amplified with ABO gene-specific primers for the modified sequence, 5′-GGGGATAGGGTTTTAAGGTATTA-3′ (sense primer, F) and 5′-CAACACCTC(A/G)ACCATAACTCC-3′ (antisense primer, R). PCR conditions used were the following: 95 °C for 9 min, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and finally 10 min at 72 °C. PCR amplification was performed in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 100 pmol of each primer, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 150 μm dNTP, and 1× buffer. Amplified DNA was electrophoresed, gel-purified, and ligated with pCR2.1. Sequencing was then performed with double-stranded plasmid templates, and 8–20 clones were sequenced per cell line. DNA methylation patterns in the CpG islands of the ABO genes were determined by chemical treatment with sodium bisulfite and subsequent PCR. Primer sequences for the unmethylated reaction were 5′-GGATAGGGTTTTAAGGTATTAGGGTTATG-3′ (sense primer, U1) and 5′-CCACATCTAATCTCAACCTCCA-3′ (antisense primer, U2). PCR conditions for the unmethylated reaction were the following: 95 °C for 9 min, 38 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and finally 10 min at 72 °C. Primer sequences for the methylated reaction were 5′-TTAAGGTATTAGGGTTACGAGGGGC-3′ (sense primer; M1) and 5′-CGACCATAACTCCGCGTCT-3′ (antisense primer; M2). PCR conditions for the methylated reaction were the following: 95 °C for 9 min, then 38 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 67 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and finally 10 min at 72 °C. PCR amplification was performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 pmol of each primer, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 150 μm dNTP, 1× buffer, and bisulfite-modified DNA (≈20 ng) or unmodified DNA (20–40 ng). The products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel. Nucleotide sequences of the PCR-amplified products with the unmethylated primers and methylated primers were determined as described above. Luciferase reporter vector plasmid SN contains the ABO gene sequence between −117 and +31 and plasmid NaN contains the −35 to +31 sequence, as described previously (18Kominato Y. Tsuchiya T. Hata N. Takizawa H. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25890-25898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). KATOIII cells were transfected with 6 μg of plasmid DNA by electroporation as described (18Kominato Y. Tsuchiya T. Hata N. Takizawa H. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25890-25898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were also transfected with plasmid DNA by electroporation. The cells were split to 3 × 105/ml 16–24 h prior to transfection. At the time of transfection, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 containing neither FBS nor l-glutamine. The cells were resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml. 0.8 ml of cell suspension was placed into a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad). Six micrograms of supercoiled plasmid DNA was added to the cell suspension in the cuvette. Cells were incubated with plasmid DNA for 5 min at room temperature prior to electroporation at 960 microfarads and 280 V. Immediately after transfection, the cuvettes were transferred to an ice bath and kept for 15 min. The cells were then transferred into 10 ml of growth medium and incubated for 24 h before being harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. MKN28 cells and T98G cells were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were split to 1 × 105/ml in a six-well tissue culture plate (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) 18–24 h prior to transfection. At the time of transfection, cells were washed once with MEM containing neither FBS norl-glutamine. Two micrograms of supercoiled plasmid DNA was suspended in 100 μl of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Five μl of Lipofectin reagent was diluted in 100 μl of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium. The two solutions were combined at room temperature for 10–15 min, followed by addition of 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium. The mixture was then overlaid onto the cells. MKN28 cells and T98G cells were incubated for 12 and 8 h, respectively, before the DNA-containing medium was replaced with 2 ml of growth medium containing serum. MKN28 cells and T98G cells were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays at 36 and 48 h, after replacement of the medium. HEL cells were transfected with DMRIE-C reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were split to 3 × 105/ml 16–24 h prior to transfection. At the time of transfection, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 containing neither FBS nor l-glutamine at room temperature. Five μl of DMRIE-C reagent was mixed with 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium in each well of a six-well plate. 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium containing 6 μg of plasmid DNA was added to each well, followed by incubation for 45 min. 2 × 106 cells in 0.2 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium was added to each well and incubated for 5 h before adding 2 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 15% FBS. HEL cells were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays at 24 h after addition of growth medium. Cell lysis and luciferase assays were performed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Light emission was measured in a model Luminous CT-9000D luminometer (Dia-Iatron, Tokyo, Japan), and values were obtained in relative light units. For all transient expression assays, the light emission observed fell within the linear range of previously determined titration curves (light emission observed versus amount of luciferase protein). Variations in transfection efficiency were normalized to the activities of β-galactosidase expressed from 2 or 0.6 μg of cotransfected plasmid containing the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat directing Escherichia coli β-galactosidase expression. β-Galactosidase activities were measured as described elsewhere (24Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Two μg of plasmid DNA was cotransfected into KATOIII cells, Jurkat cells, and HEL cells, whereas 0.6 μg of the plasmid was cotransfected into MKN28 cells and T98G cells. Activity of the pGL3-promoter vector containing the SV40 promoter was used to assign an arbitrary value of 1.0 to facilitate the comparison of the values obtained from different experiments. Recombinant HhaI methylase was used to methylate pGL3-basic vector and the ABO promoter/luciferase reporter constructs. Plasmid DNA was incubated with 5 units of the HhaI methylase per μg of DNA in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 80 μm S-adenosylmethionine, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C overnight. Complete methylation was confirmed by the resulting resistance againstHhaI restriction endonuclease digestion analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Only samples that were protected fromHhaI restriction enzyme digestion were used in the transfection experiments. MKN28 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105/ml in 25 ml of normal growth medium, and 2.5, 12.5, or 25 μl of 10 mm5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine purchased from Sigma was added (1, 5, or 10 μm final concentration, respectively). Cells were incubated for 5 days before harvesting total RNA and DNA. For immunostaining, MKN28 cells were seeded at 3 × 104/ml and cultured with growth medium containing 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine at 5 and 10 μm for 5 days before fixation for immunostaining. According to the method of Pattnalk et al.(25Pattnalk A.K. Brown D.J. Nayak D.P.J. Virology. 1986; 60: 994-1001Crossref Google Scholar, 26Kominato Y. Fujikura T. Takizawa H. Hayashi K. Fujimaki M. Kishi K. Suzuki T. Eur. J. Immunogenet. 1992; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), surface A-antigens of MKN28 and MKN45 cells were immunologically examined using immunofluorescence. MKN45 cells were used as positive control because we observed large amounts of A-antigens on their cell surfaces (26Kominato Y. Fujikura T. Takizawa H. Hayashi K. Fujimaki M. Kishi K. Suzuki T. Eur. J. Immunogenet. 1992; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Since treatment of erythrocytes with proteolytic enzymes is known to have no effect on the ABH antigens, the cells were dispersed with trypsin. The cells were promptly dried on glass slides and were fixed in 0.072 mcacodylate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% para-formaldehyde and 0.72% sucrose for 30 min at 4 °C. The fixed cells were incubated with murine anti-A monoclonal antibody mixture (Ortho Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ) in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM antibody (Tago, Burlingame, CA) at 37 °C for 1 h. The frequencies of A-positive cells were obtained from three independent experiments. Previous characterization of the 5′ upstream sequence of the ABO genes indicates that the region between −117 and +31 has promoter activity and is sufficient to direct the expression of a reporter gene when placed 5′ adjacent to the reporter gene (18Kominato Y. Tsuchiya T. Hata N. Takizawa H. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25890-25898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Inspection of the promoter region reveals the presence of several GC boxes just upstream from the transcription initiation sites, whereas known sequence motifs for tissue-specific DNA binding proteins are not present. Partial sequence between −246 and +50 of the human ABO genes is shown in Fig. 1. The nucleotide sequence around the 5′ upstream region of the ABO genes reveals that the GC-rich region extends from the immediate 5′-flanking region through the first exon and into the first intron as shown in Fig. 2. This nucleotide sequence has been deposited to GenBankTM by us and by others (GenBankTM accession numbers U22302, AF014105, andAC000397). This region fulfills the criteria for a CpG island by having a G + C content of 76% and a CpG/GpC ratio of 0.9 (27Antequera F. Bird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11995-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Two Alu repeats are present 5′ to the CpG island in inverse orientations. The proximal Alu repeat is located immediately 5′ to the CpG island and within 1 kb upstream of the transcription start sites. Recently, a number of CpG islands have been found juxtaposed to multiple Alu repeats as reported by Graff et al. (28Graff J.R. Herman J.G. Myöhänen S. Baylin S.B. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22322-22329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Approximately half of the genes, or some 40,000–50,000 genes in mice and humans have a 5′ CpG island (29Antequera F. Bird A. Jost J.P Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1993: 169-185Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These are largely the “housekeeping” genes, which have a broad tissue expression pattern. However, there are also many tissue-specific genes that contain 5′ CpG islands (27Antequera F. Bird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11995-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 29Antequera F. Bird A. Jost J.P Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1993: 169-185Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Bird A. Cell. 1992; 70: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Alterations in DNA methylation of CpG sites have been shown to control tissue-specific expression of various genes (19Rideout III, W.M. Evesole-Cire P. Spruck C.H. Hustad C.M. Coetzee G.A. Gonzales F.A. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6143-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Benvenuto G. Carpentieri M.L. Salvatore P. Cindolo L. Bruni C.B. Chiariotti L. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, a 5′ CpG island hypermethylation is well known to be associated with transcriptional inactivation of certain cancer-related genes in neoplastic cells (20Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.-P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated the possibility that DNA methylation of the ABO genes controls gene expression in tissue-specific manner, as well as silencing in tumors.FIG. 2Defining the 5′ CpG island in the ABO gene. The top diagram indicates ABO gene exon 1 and its flanking region. The sequence located between −2000 and +2000 relative to the upstream transcription start site of the ABO genes was compiled from GenBankTM accession number AC00397. Theschematic shows the location of the first exon in the ABO gene as a closed box, whereas the small closed arrow represents the upstream transcription start site. The second exon is not indicated in the figure, since it is located 13 kb downstream from the first exon. The open arrows represent the position and orientation of the Alu sequences, which were assigned by homology search of sequence U14574 with the Alu repeat data base of the National Center for Biotechnology using BLAST algorithm. The 5′ Alu sequence shows 82% homology with the 3′ Alu sequence, although these Alu sequences are located in the opposite direction. The middle mountain plot shows the G + C density in the sequence between −2.0 and +2.0 kb. The plot was constructed using GENETYX-SV/RC10.1 with an average span of 100 and a step of 1. The plot shows that the sequence between −0.7 kb to +0.6 kb includes a G + C content of greater than 60%. The bottom portion of the figure represents the distribution of CpG dinucleotides in the ABO gene 5′ region. Thevertical lines indicate the position of each CpG dinucleotide in the DNA sequence from positions −2000 to +2000 relative to the upstream transcription start site of the ABO gene. Dense clustering of CpG sites is shown in the sequence between −0.7 kb and +0.6 kb in which CpG density is 11.7%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since inverse correlation between transcriptional activation and hypermethylation of local CpG sites has been reported for a number of genes in association with cell type-specific expression and repression during tumorigenesis, we first examined the expression status of the ABO genes at the RNA and the protein (enzyme) levels in various cell lines. Since DNA methylation has been observed to determine the tissue-specific expression of a gene (19Rideout III, W.M. Evesole-Cire P. Spruck C.H. Hustad C.M. Coetzee G.A. Gonzales F.A. Jones P.A. Mol.

The effect of various deletions and mutations within the 5′-flanking region of the human MnSOD gene promoter was evaluated using the luciferase reporter system in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Deletion of a region between −1292 and −1202 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site abolished TPA-responsive induction, whereas deletion of the putative binding sequence for NF-κB or AP-1 did not. The region between −1292 and −1202 contains a cAMP-responsive element-like sequence, TGACGTCT, which we identified as the manganese superoxide dismutase TPA-responsive element, MSTRE. Site-specific mutation of the MSTRE abolished the TPA-responsive induction, validating the critical role of this sequence. We detected specific MSTRE activity from nuclear extracts and demonstrated by antibody supershift assay that this activity is closely related to CREB-1/ATF-1. TPA treatment rapidly induced phosphorylation of the CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor via the protein kinase C pathway. These results led us to conclude that the human MnSOD gene having the promoter construct used in this study is induced by TPA via activation of a CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor and not via either NF-κB or AP-1. In addition, we found that this induction was blocked by inhibitors of flavoproteins and NADPH oxidases, indicating involvement of enhanced generation of superoxide radical anion as an upstream signal.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)1 is located in the mitochondrial matrix, which is encoded by a nuclear gene. Mitochondria are particularly prone to oxidative DNA damage because they metabolize over 95% of the oxygen (2Guidot D.M. McCord J.M. Wright R.M. Repine J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26699-26703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but they lack histones and have a poor ability for DNA repair (3Richter C. Park J.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6465-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Thus, MnSOD is regarded as the primary defensive enzyme against oxidative stress within mitochondria. Loss of MnSOD is implicated in causing various human tumors (4Church S.L. Farmer D.R. Nelson D.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Lee J.H. Kavanagh J.J.

Most of these treatments could generate reactive oxygen species in cells that, in turn, could activate transcription factors, mainly NF-κB and AP-1 (20Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A.

In accordance, the involvement of NF-κB (22Warner B.B. Stuart L. Gebb S. Wispe J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L150-L158PubMed Google Scholar, 23Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J.

Demple B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in activating MnSOD genes in response to TNF-α, TPA, H2O2, or thiol-reducing agents has been suggested in human and rat cells. These studies correlated the conditions that changed the DNA binding activity of either NF-κB or AP-1 with the induction of MnSOD, and thus concluded that the activation of the MnSOD gene is mediated by either of these factors. However, the responsive cis-acting elements, as well as the changes in or modification of the binding factor, have not been directly demonstrated. Recently, Jones et al. (26Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have shown that the mouse MnSOD gene is regulated by TNF-α and interleukin-1 through a complex intronic enhancer located in intron 2 involving binding of C/EBP and NF-κB. They also found that the 5′-flanking promoter region of the MnSOD gene is not involved in the TNF-mediated MnSOD mRNA induction. However, relatively little information is available regarding the molecular mechanism for modulating the expression of the MnSOD gene, SOD2, by TPA.In this study, we present evidence that the TPA-responsive element in the induction of MnSOD gene expression is a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-like element bound to a CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor, which is located in the 5′-flanking DNA sequence. The activation of the CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor is caused by rapid phosphorylation via the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. In addition, NADPH oxidase or similar flavoproteins are also involved in the induction of the MnSOD gene, which may indicate that superoxide radical anion is an upstream signal for this induction.DISCUSSIONThe results obtained in this study allowed us to identify a responsive element for TPA-induced MnSOD mRNA, the MSTRE, at the 5′-flanking region of MnSOD gene (Figs. 1 and 2). The TPA-responsive induction of MnSOD mRNA requires binding of the MSTRE to the CREB-1/ATF-1-like transcription factor (Fig. 3), which is activated by PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation (Figs. 4 and 5). This induction was blocked by inhibitors of NADPH oxidase or related flavoproteins (Fig. 6), suggesting the involvement of enhanced generation of superoxide radical anion as an upstream signal for the TPA-mediated MnSOD induction.It has previously been demonstrated that TPA activates NF-κB and AP-1 via the PKC pathway (20Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem.

Sci. 1992; 17: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These previous reports, as well as the presence of consensus binding motifs for NF-κB and AP-1 in the 5′-flanking region of the MnSOD gene, suggested that induction of the MnSOD gene by TPA treatment might be mediated by NF-κB and/or AP-1. The fact that these factors are also activated by pro-oxidants or anti-oxidants (22Warner B.B. Stuart L. Gebb S. Wispe J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L150-L158PubMed Google Scholar, 23Das K.C.

Biophys. 1997; 348: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) provided a conceptual link between the TPA treatment that could generate reactive oxygen species and the mechanism of MnSOD induction that converts one form of reactive oxygen species (O2) into another (H2O2). To our surprise, however, deletion of putative binding sites for NF-κB and AP-1 within 3340 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking region did not affect the TPA-induced MnSOD gene. Instead, our results indicate that a CRE-related sequence, MSTRE, bound to the CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor and controlled by phosphorylation, is responsible for the TPA-induced MnSOD gene in this promoter construct. The similarity between the CRE (TGACGTCA) and the TPA-responsive element, TRE (TGAGTCA), sequences may allow cross-talk between components of the two major signal transduction pathways. Indeed, it has been shown that AP-1 can bind to both TRE and CRE, which leads to the activation of CRE-dependent transcription in vivo (49Sassone-Corsi P. Ransone L.J. Verma I.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar, 50Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T. Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Ishii S.

Although we observed enhanced AP-1 binding to its consensus TRE-binding motif following TPA treatment of A549 cells and a partial competition of MSTRE-bound complex by excess cold TRE-containing probes, our data obtained by antibody supershift analysis also clearly demonstrated that the AP-1 complex composed of Jun/Fos does not bind to MSTRE to mediate TPA-induced MnSOD gene (Fig. 3 B).The ubiquitously expressed CREB protein is a well characterized transcription factor regulated by phosphorylation, in most cases, via the PKA and PKC pathways (52Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 53Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation in response to cAMP stimulation has no effect on the ability of CREB to bind CRE, but it enhances transcriptional efficiency 20-fold in vitro (51Hoeffler J.P. Deutsch P.J. Lin J. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 868-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,55Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs W.H.D. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the T cell antigen receptor engagement resulted in the rapid phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 via PKC pathway and its concomitant activity (53Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22841-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our results also clearly demonstrated that there is no change in the abundance or binding activity of CREB-1/ATF-1 complexes following TPA treatment of A549 cells (Fig. 4). This result is consistent with the previously observed behavior of activated CREB (43Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldscmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). This transcription factor can bind to DNA as a homodimer or can form a heterodimer with other bZip proteins, such as ATF-1, which share many structural properties with CREB (56Hai T.W. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that ATF-1 as well as an CREB-1-like factors bound to MSTRE become phosphorylated upon TPA treatment and suggest that heterodimeric as well as homodimeric complexes of ATF-1 and CREB-1-like factors are involved in inducing the MnSOD gene. In addition, our results demonstrated that the specific inhibitor for PKC, BIM, rather than the PKA inhibitor, blocked the TPA-mediated induction of MnSOD mRNA (Fig. 5). The previous report (53Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22841-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as well as our preliminary results, showed that BIM also inhibits TPA-responsive phosphorylation of CREB. These findings together suggest that the TPA-responsive MnSOD mRNA induction is mediated mainly by the phosphorylation of CREB-1/ATF-1-like factors via the PKC pathway.Superoxide radical anions are generated by NADPH oxidase in phagocytes as a host defense. In a resting state, NADPH oxidase assembly in phagocytes consists of several proteins: p47 phox, p67 phox, and Ras-related GTP binding protein, in cytosol, and gp91 phox and p22 phox, which are two components of a flavoprotein cytochromeb 558, located in plasma membrane. During activation, p47 phox is phosphorylated and translocated together with other cytosolic components to the plasma membrane, where they interact with a flavoprotein cytochromeb 558 to form an active complex that catalyzes the formation of O2 from oxygen (42Chanock S.J. el Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Aegal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In other type of cells, such as fibroblasts, the NADPH oxidase-like enzyme is also implicated in the generation of superoxide radical anions in a similar manner, which is probably involved in signaling processes (42Chanock S.J. el Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldscmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Our results showed that both DPI, an inhibitor of flavoproteins, and AEBSF, an inhibitor for the interaction of p47 phox and/or p67 phox with cytochromeb 558 (46Diatchuk V. Lotan O. Koshkin V. Wilkstroem P. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13292-13301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), block the induction of MnSOD mRNA. It suggests, therefore, that an upstream signal for TPA-mediated induction of MnSOD mRNA may be O2 generated by NADPH oxidase or similar oxidases activated by TPA.MSTRE may not be the only TPA-responsive element mediating activation of human MnSOD gene in vivo. The level of MnSOD mRNA increases about 6-fold following treatment of A549 cells with TPA for 4 h. The TPA-induced luciferase expression from pSODLUC exhibits, however, only about 2–3-fold stimulation over the untreated cells. The difference in the extent of induction may imply that other TPA-responsive elements exist in the region outside of the promoter sequences examined in this work. Nevertheless, a mechanism for the TPA-mediated MnSOD induction is likely to include the activation of a NADPH oxidase-like enzyme to generate O2 as an upstream signal and phosphorylation of a CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor needed for MSTRE-mediated transcriptional activation of the MnSOD gene. This or a similar mechanism involving O2 as an upstream signal for the induction of MnSOD may be congruent with the role of the enzyme against O2 toxicity in vivo. Superoxide dismutase catalyzes the disproportionation reaction of superoxide radical anion (O2) to hydrogen peroxide (1Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)1 is located in the mitochondrial matrix, which is encoded by a nuclear gene. Mitochondria are particularly prone to oxidative DNA damage because they metabolize over 95% of the oxygen (2Guidot D.M. McCord J.M. Wright R.M. Repine J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26699-26703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but they lack histones and have a poor ability for DNA repair (3Richter C. Park J.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6465-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Thus, MnSOD is regarded as the primary defensive enzyme against oxidative stress within mitochondria. Loss of MnSOD is implicated in causing various human tumors (4Church S.L. Farmer D.R. Nelson D.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Lee J.H. Kavanagh J.J.

Most of these treatments could generate reactive oxygen species in cells that, in turn, could activate transcription factors, mainly NF-κB and AP-1 (20Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A.

Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), to allow their nuclear translocation and allow them to bind to genes involved in the stress responses. In accordance, the involvement of NF-κB (22Warner B.B. Stuart L. Gebb S. Wispe J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L150-L158PubMed Google Scholar, 23Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J.

Demple B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in activating MnSOD genes in response to TNF-α, TPA, H2O2, or thiol-reducing agents has been suggested in human and rat cells. These studies correlated the conditions that changed the DNA binding activity of either NF-κB or AP-1 with the induction of MnSOD, and thus concluded that the activation of the MnSOD gene is mediated by either of these factors. However, the responsive cis-acting elements, as well as the changes in or modification of the binding factor, have not been directly demonstrated. Recently, Jones et al. (26Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have shown that the mouse MnSOD gene is regulated by TNF-α and interleukin-1 through a complex intronic enhancer located in intron 2 involving binding of C/EBP and NF-κB. They also found that the 5′-flanking promoter region of the MnSOD gene is not involved in the TNF-mediated MnSOD mRNA induction. However, relatively little information is available regarding the molecular mechanism for modulating the expression of the MnSOD gene, SOD2, by TPA. In this study, we present evidence that the TPA-responsive element in the induction of MnSOD gene expression is a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-like element bound to a CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor, which is located in the 5′-flanking DNA sequence. The activation of the CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor is caused by rapid phosphorylation via the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. In addition, NADPH oxidase or similar flavoproteins are also involved in the induction of the MnSOD gene, which may indicate that superoxide radical anion is an upstream signal for this induction. DISCUSSIONThe results obtained in this study allowed us to identify a responsive element for TPA-induced MnSOD mRNA, the MSTRE, at the 5′-flanking region of MnSOD gene (Figs. 1 and 2). The TPA-responsive induction of MnSOD mRNA requires binding of the MSTRE to the CREB-1/ATF-1-like transcription factor (Fig. 3), which is activated by PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation (Figs. 4 and 5). This induction was blocked by inhibitors of NADPH oxidase or related flavoproteins (Fig. 6), suggesting the involvement of enhanced generation of superoxide radical anion as an upstream signal for the TPA-mediated MnSOD induction.It has previously been demonstrated that TPA activates NF-κB and AP-1 via the PKC pathway (20Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem.

These previous reports, as well as the presence of consensus binding motifs for NF-κB and AP-1 in the 5′-flanking region of the MnSOD gene, suggested that induction of the MnSOD gene by TPA treatment might be mediated by NF-κB and/or AP-1. The fact that these factors are also activated by pro-oxidants or anti-oxidants (22Warner B.B. Stuart L. Gebb S. Wispe J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L150-L158PubMed Google Scholar, 23Das K.C.

To our surprise, however, deletion of putative binding sites for NF-κB and AP-1 within 3340 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking region did not affect the TPA-induced MnSOD gene. Instead, our results indicate that a CRE-related sequence, MSTRE, bound to the CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor and controlled by phosphorylation, is responsible for the TPA-induced MnSOD gene in this promoter construct. The similarity between the CRE (TGACGTCA) and the TPA-responsive element, TRE (TGAGTCA), sequences may allow cross-talk between components of the two major signal transduction pathways. Indeed, it has been shown that AP-1 can bind to both TRE and CRE, which leads to the activation of CRE-dependent transcription in vivo (49Sassone-Corsi P. Ransone L.J. Verma I.M.

Although we observed enhanced AP-1 binding to its consensus TRE-binding motif following TPA treatment of A549 cells and a partial competition of MSTRE-bound complex by excess cold TRE-containing probes, our data obtained by antibody supershift analysis also clearly demonstrated that the AP-1 complex composed of Jun/Fos does not bind to MSTRE to mediate TPA-induced MnSOD gene (Fig. 3 B).The ubiquitously expressed CREB protein is a well characterized transcription factor regulated by phosphorylation, in most cases, via the PKA and PKC pathways (52Montminy M.

A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation in response to cAMP stimulation has no effect on the ability of CREB to bind CRE, but it enhances transcriptional efficiency 20-fold in vitro (51Hoeffler J.P. Deutsch P.J. Lin J.

Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the T cell antigen receptor engagement resulted in the rapid phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 via PKC pathway and its concomitant activity (53Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22841-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our results also clearly demonstrated that there is no change in the abundance or binding activity of CREB-1/ATF-1 complexes following TPA treatment of A549 cells (Fig. 4). This result is consistent with the previously observed behavior of activated CREB (43Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldscmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). This transcription factor can bind to DNA as a homodimer or can form a heterodimer with other bZip proteins, such as ATF-1, which share many structural properties with CREB (56Hai T.W. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that ATF-1 as well as an CREB-1-like factors bound to MSTRE become phosphorylated upon TPA treatment and suggest that heterodimeric as well as homodimeric complexes of ATF-1 and CREB-1-like factors are involved in inducing the MnSOD gene. In addition, our results demonstrated that the specific inhibitor for PKC, BIM, rather than the PKA inhibitor, blocked the TPA-mediated induction of MnSOD mRNA (Fig. 5). The previous report (53Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22841-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as well as our preliminary results, showed that BIM also inhibits TPA-responsive phosphorylation of CREB. These findings together suggest that the TPA-responsive MnSOD mRNA induction is mediated mainly by the phosphorylation of CREB-1/ATF-1-like factors via the PKC pathway.Superoxide radical anions are generated by NADPH oxidase in phagocytes as a host defense. In a resting state, NADPH oxidase assembly in phagocytes consists of several proteins: p47 phox, p67 phox, and Ras-related GTP binding protein, in cytosol, and gp91 phox and p22 phox, which are two components of a flavoprotein cytochromeb 558, located in plasma membrane. During activation, p47 phox is phosphorylated and translocated together with other cytosolic components to the plasma membrane, where they interact with a flavoprotein cytochromeb 558 to form an active complex that catalyzes the formation of O2 from oxygen (42Chanock S.J. el Benna J.

In other type of cells, such as fibroblasts, the NADPH oxidase-like enzyme is also implicated in the generation of superoxide radical anions in a similar manner, which is probably involved in signaling processes (42Chanock S.J. el Benna J.

Our results showed that both DPI, an inhibitor of flavoproteins, and AEBSF, an inhibitor for the interaction of p47 phox and/or p67 phox with cytochromeb 558 (46Diatchuk V. Lotan O. Koshkin V. Wilkstroem P. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13292-13301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), block the induction of MnSOD mRNA. It suggests, therefore, that an upstream signal for TPA-mediated induction of MnSOD mRNA may be O2 generated by NADPH oxidase or similar oxidases activated by TPA.MSTRE may not be the only TPA-responsive element mediating activation of human MnSOD gene in vivo. The level of MnSOD mRNA increases about 6-fold following treatment of A549 cells with TPA for 4 h. The TPA-induced luciferase expression from pSODLUC exhibits, however, only about 2–3-fold stimulation over the untreated cells. The difference in the extent of induction may imply that other TPA-responsive elements exist in the region outside of the promoter sequences examined in this work. Nevertheless, a mechanism for the TPA-mediated MnSOD induction is likely to include the activation of a NADPH oxidase-like enzyme to generate O2 as an upstream signal and phosphorylation of a CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor needed for MSTRE-mediated transcriptional activation of the MnSOD gene. This or a similar mechanism involving O2 as an upstream signal for the induction of MnSOD may be congruent with the role of the enzyme against O2 toxicity in vivo. The results obtained in this study allowed us to identify a responsive element for TPA-induced MnSOD mRNA, the MSTRE, at the 5′-flanking region of MnSOD gene (Figs. 1 and 2). The TPA-responsive induction of MnSOD mRNA requires binding of the MSTRE to the CREB-1/ATF-1-like transcription factor (Fig. 3), which is activated by PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation (Figs. 4 and 5). This induction was blocked by inhibitors of NADPH oxidase or related flavoproteins (Fig. 6), suggesting the involvement of enhanced generation of superoxide radical anion as an upstream signal for the TPA-mediated MnSOD induction. It has previously been demonstrated that TPA activates NF-κB and AP-1 via the PKC pathway (20Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 47Karin M. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 48Karin M. Smeal T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These previous reports, as well as the presence of consensus binding motifs for NF-κB and AP-1 in the 5′-flanking region of the MnSOD gene, suggested that induction of the MnSOD gene by TPA treatment might be mediated by NF-κB and/or AP-1. The fact that these factors are also activated by pro-oxidants or anti-oxidants (22Warner B.B. Stuart L. Gebb S. Wispe J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L150-L158PubMed Google Scholar, 23Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L588-L602PubMed Google Scholar, 24Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 148: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Borrello S. Demple B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) provided a conceptual link between the TPA treatment that could generate reactive oxygen species and the mechanism of MnSOD induction that converts one form of reactive oxygen species (O2) into another (H2O2). To our surprise, however, deletion of putative binding sites for NF-κB and AP-1 within 3340 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking region did not affect the TPA-induced MnSOD gene. Instead, our results indicate that a CRE-related sequence, MSTRE, bound to the CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor and controlled by phosphorylation, is responsible for the TPA-induced MnSOD gene in this promoter construct. The similarity between the CRE (TGACGTCA) and the TPA-responsive element, TRE (TGAGTCA), sequences may allow cross-talk between components of the two major signal transduction pathways. Indeed, it has been shown that AP-1 can bind to both TRE and CRE, which leads to the activation of CRE-dependent transcription in vivo (49Sassone-Corsi P. Ransone L.J. Verma I.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar, 50Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T. Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Ishii S.

Although we observed enhanced AP-1 binding to its consensus TRE-binding motif following TPA treatment of A549 cells and a partial competition of MSTRE-bound complex by excess cold TRE-containing probes, our data obtained by antibody supershift analysis also clearly demonstrated that the AP-1 complex composed of Jun/Fos does not bind to MSTRE to mediate TPA-induced MnSOD gene (Fig. 3 B). The ubiquitously expressed CREB protein is a well characterized transcription factor regulated by phosphorylation, in most cases, via the PKA and PKC pathways (52Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 53Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation in response to cAMP stimulation has no effect on the ability of CREB to bind CRE, but it enhances transcriptional efficiency 20-fold in vitro (51Hoeffler J.P. Deutsch P.J. Lin J. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 868-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,55Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs W.H.D. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the T cell antigen receptor engagement resulted in the rapid phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 via PKC pathway and its concomitant activity (53Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22841-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our results also clearly demonstrated that there is no change in the abundance or binding activity of CREB-1/ATF-1 complexes following TPA treatment of A549 cells (Fig. 4). This result is consistent with the previously observed behavior of activated CREB (43Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldscmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). This transcription factor can bind to DNA as a homodimer or can form a heterodimer with other bZip proteins, such as ATF-1, which share many structural properties with CREB (56Hai T.W. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that ATF-1 as well as an CREB-1-like factors bound to MSTRE become phosphorylated upon TPA treatment and suggest that heterodimeric as well as homodimeric complexes of ATF-1 and CREB-1-like factors are involved in inducing the MnSOD gene. In addition, our results demonstrated that the specific inhibitor for PKC, BIM, rather than the PKA inhibitor, blocked the TPA-mediated induction of MnSOD mRNA (Fig. 5). The previous report (53Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22841-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as well as our preliminary results, showed that BIM also inhibits TPA-responsive phosphorylation of CREB. These findings together suggest that the TPA-responsive MnSOD mRNA induction is mediated mainly by the phosphorylation of CREB-1/ATF-1-like factors via the PKC pathway. Superoxide radical anions are generated by NADPH oxidase in phagocytes as a host defense. In a resting state, NADPH oxidase assembly in phagocytes consists of several proteins: p47 phox, p67 phox, and Ras-related GTP binding protein, in cytosol, and gp91 phox and p22 phox, which are two components of a flavoprotein cytochromeb 558, located in plasma membrane. During activation, p47 phox is phosphorylated and translocated together with other cytosolic components to the plasma membrane, where they interact with a flavoprotein cytochromeb 558 to form an active complex that catalyzes the formation of O2 from oxygen (42Chanock S.J. el Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Aegal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In other type of cells, such as fibroblasts, the NADPH oxidase-like enzyme is also implicated in the generation of superoxide radical anions in a similar manner, which is probably involved in signaling processes (42Chanock S.J. el Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldscmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Our results showed that both DPI, an inhibitor of flavoproteins, and AEBSF, an inhibitor for the interaction of p47 phox and/or p67 phox with cytochromeb 558 (46Diatchuk V. Lotan O. Koshkin V. Wilkstroem P. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13292-13301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), block the induction of MnSOD mRNA. It suggests, therefore, that an upstream signal for TPA-mediated induction of MnSOD mRNA may be O2 generated by NADPH oxidase or similar oxidases activated by TPA. MSTRE may not be the only TPA-responsive element mediating activation of human MnSOD gene in vivo. The level of MnSOD mRNA increases about 6-fold following treatment of A549 cells with TPA for 4 h. The TPA-induced luciferase expression from pSODLUC exhibits, however, only about 2–3-fold stimulation over the untreated cells. The difference in the extent of induction may imply that other TPA-responsive elements exist in the region outside of the promoter sequences examined in this work. Nevertheless, a mechanism for the TPA-mediated MnSOD induction is likely to include the activation of a NADPH oxidase-like enzyme to generate O2 as an upstream signal and phosphorylation of a CREB-1/ATF-1-like factor needed for MSTRE-mediated transcriptional activation of the MnSOD gene. This or a similar mechanism involving O2 as an upstream signal for the induction of MnSOD may be congruent with the role of the enzyme against O2 toxicity in vivo."

Red/green opsin, Ran-GTPase, and the 19 S regulatory complex of the proteasome associate with specific RanBP2 structural modules. Some of these play a role in chaperoning the functional expression of opsin. RanBP2 localization at cytoplasmic fibrils emanating from the nuclear pore complex and interaction with the Ran-GTPase support also its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport processes. The degenerate nucleoporin repeat motifs FXFG, GLFG, and XXFG have been proposed to mediate the movement of nucleocytoplasmic transport factors. In particular, RanBP2 has been implicated in nuclear import processes. Here, we show the zinc fingers of RanBP2 associate with high specificity to the nuclear export factor, exportin-1 (CRM1). The bovine RanBP2 transcript contained only five of the eight zinc fingers reported in the human counterpart and are sufficient for exportin-1 association with RanBP2. In contrast to Ran interaction with RanBP2-exportin-1 complex, exportin-1 binding to the zinc finger cluster domain of RanBP2 is insensitive to leptomycin B and nucleotide-bound state of Ran-GTPase. Our results indicate that the zinc finger-rich domain of RanBP2 constitutes a docking site for exportin-1 during nuclear export. Thus, RanBP2 emerges as a key component of the nuclear export pathway.

Cell. 1998; 92: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Many are ubiquitous throughout cells, and emerging evidence shows that networks of intertwining protein machines underline many cellular processes. Protein complexes allow channeling of substrates and, consequently, compartmentalization of biological activity in an extremely coordinated and efficient manner. Furthermore, protein-protein interactions within protein machines allow biological processes to be tightly regulated. Whereas many of these protein-protein interactions occur in a stable fashion, others may be transient in nature. This allows the fluid recruitment of substrates into higher order complexes and modulation of biological responses. The retinal Ran-binding protein 2 (RanBP2)1 is a scaffold protein composed of multiple, distinct, and well defined structural modules mediating, singly or in combination, the recruitment of protein machines (e.g. regulatory subunits of the 26 S proteasome) (2Ferreira P. Yunfei C. Schick D. Roepman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24676-24682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and molecular switches (e.g. Ran-GTPase) (3Ferreira P.

We have shown that the combination of Ran-binding domain 4 and cyclophilin domains are required to enhance in vivo the production of functional opsin receptor (3Ferreira P. Nakayama T. Pak W. Travis G. Nature. 1996; 383: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and generate an opsin isoform with low propensity to self-aggregate. In addition, the 19 S regulatory subunits of the proteasome associated specifically and selectively in retinal tissue with the cyclophilin-like domain (CLD) of RanBP2 (2Ferreira P. Yunfei C.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 455-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, we have proposed that the association of RanBP2 with the proteasome may lead to the processing of RanBP2 and production of at least another smaller RanBP2 isoform in retinal cells (2Ferreira P. Yunfei C. Schick D. Roepman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24676-24682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Altogether these results suggest that at least some subunits of the 19 S cap of the proteasome may play a selective surveillance role during the processing of opsins and RanBP2. RanBP2 appears to belong to a large family of proteins, nucleoporins, due to its localization at the vicinity of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (5Yokoyama N. Hayashi N. Seki T. Pante N. Ohba T.

Other “atypical” proteins have been also localized at the NPC, such as Sec13p (and the related, Seh1p) (13Siniossoglou S. Wimmer C. Rieger M. Doye V. Tekotte H. Weise C. Emig S. Segref A. Hurt E.C.

The vectorial nature of the nuclear transport is based on a proposed nuclear-to-cytoplasm Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP asymmetric distribution of Ran-GTPase.

The nucleocytoplasmic movement of substrates has been proposed to occur via a stochastic process through reiterated steps of docking-undocking reactions between degenerate FXFG, and GLFG, repeats of nucleoporins and subunits of nuclear transport factors (43Rexach M.

To understand better the role of RanBP2 in nucleocytoplasmic transport and retinal function, we have taken a novel systematic approach in isolating and identifying components that interact specifically with selective and well defined domains of RanBP2 (2Ferreira P.

Here, we report that the zinc finger cluster domain of bovine RanBP2 associates with high specificity to the conserved chromosome region maintenance protein 1, CRM1 (45Adachi Y. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This protein was found to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm mediating the export of substrates containing nuclear export signals (NES) (46Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Thus, the zinc finger cluster domain of RanBP2 likely constitutes a cytoplasmic docking domain for the delivery of nuclear cargo transported by exportin-1 to the cytoplasmic machinery. We discuss the implications of these findings on RanBP2 function in nucleocytoplasmic export and protein kinesis and biogenesis. The ∼1.5- and 1.9-kb bovine and human zinc finger domain cDNAs, respectively, were isolated at least four times by RT-PCR of bovine and human tissues and mRNA of cells as indicated. Poly(A+) RNA was extracted directly from bovine retinas using the Poly(A) Tract System 1000 (Promega) as directed by the manufacturer. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with 1 μg of mRNA using the antisense-specific primer against the 5′-end of bovine Ran-binding domain-2 (RBD2), 5′-GTCCTCAGTCTTATAGGCATCATC. This reverse primer and the forward primer, 5′-GAATTTCAGGTTGCAAAGAAAGAAG, against the 3′-sequence of Ran-binding domain-1 (RBD1) were derived from cDNA clones comprising RBD2 and RBD1 domains of bovine RanBP2 that were isolated from the screening of a randomly primed bovine retinal cDNA library using two-hybrid and standard library screening procedures. 2P. A. Ferreira et al., manuscript in preparation. These primers were also 100% identical to the RanBP2 sequence isolated from HeLa and lymphocyte cells. RT-PCR was performed using SuperScript reverse transcriptase II (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. PCR reactions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm concentration of dNTP, 20 pmol of each amplification primer, first strand cDNA, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. Thirty five cycles of PCR were performed at the following conditions: 94 °C denaturation for 30 s, 55 °C annealing for 45 s, and 68 °C extension for 3 min. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel. The ∼1.5-kb bovine retinal cDNA product was eluted and subcloned into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The EcoRI fragment having ∼1.5-kb gene product was double-strand sequenced and subcloned in-frame into the pGEX-KG (77Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) vector digested with EcoRI. At least 10 clones were analyzed for the right orientation of the insert. Similarly, the ∼1.9-kb cDNA products from mRNA of human retinas and HeLa cells were isolated by the same exact methods, conditions, and primers. At least two bovine cDNA clones were double-strand sequenced using standard sequencing methods to overcome nucleotide mis-incorporation occurred by PCR. Radiation hybrid mapping was performed with the Stanford G3 Radiation Hybrid Panel (Research Genetics). PCR reactions were performed in a volume of 10 μl using 25 ng of DNA of each hamster/human hybrid cell line, 4 pmol of primer 2740 (gtgcttagtaagaaatgaagc, specific for zinc fingers 5–7) and primer 2741 (cttagtgaacattccctcaaa, reverse primer, specific for zinc fingers 4–6), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, and 0.4 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Amplification was performed for 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min in an ABI 9600 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer). The localization of the cDNA fragments in the Stanford G3 Radiation Hybrid Map was determined at the Stanford Human Genome Center. The highest LOD scores were obtained for the markers SHGC-1639 (LOD score 7.82, DIST. 24 cRs) and SHGC-37095 (LOD score 5.71, DIST. 36 cRs) on chromosome 2 (51Krebber H. Bastians H. Hoheisel J.

RanBP2 was previously linked to SHGC-36406, in reference interval D2S293-D2S121 (122.4–127.9 centimorgans), which correlates to chromosome 2 map position 252–265, thus confirming the mapping results of the zinc finger domain. Expression of GST fusion and GST-cleaved proteins was carried out as described previously (4Ferreira P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 455-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 77Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Escherichia coli-expressing cultures were supplemented with 60 μm ZnSO4 at the time of induction. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBST buffer (4Ferreira P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 455-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without EDTA and supplemented with 100 μm ZnSO4 and 2 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed by passing the cell suspension through a French press at 1200 pounds/square inch. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was loaded on a glutathione S-agarose affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and protein purification was carried out on an AKTA explorer FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All buffers were supplemented with 60 μm ZnSO4. Incubation reactions of GST-fused constructs (2.2 μm) with CHAPS-solubilized bovine retinal extracts (∼2.5 mg of total protein) were carried out exactly as described previously (2Ferreira P. Yunfei C. Schick D. Roepman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24676-24682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Ferreira P. Nakayama T. Pak W. Travis G.

The other tissue extracts (liver, brain, and spleen) were prepared similarly to that of retina, and GST pull-down assays were performed similarly using ∼2.5 mg of total protein. Chicken retinal extracts reactions contained about 1.2 mg of total protein extract and 2.2 μm GST-fused construct. When applicable, nonhydrolyzable nucleotides (Sigma) were added at a concentration of 400 μm. Unfused construct (competitor) was used at 5-fold molar excess, except with RBD4, where a 10-fold molar of unfused protein was used. For exportin-1 elution assays, EDTA, DTT, and/or TPEN were added to the washed pellets of incubation reactions at a concentration of 50, 10, and 5 mm, respectively, for 10 min at 4 °C. Zn2+-ZnF reconstitution assays were carried out by incubating GST-ZnF with retinal extracts, washing of the coprecipitates, elution of exportin-1 with 1 mm TPEN for 10 min at 4 °C followed by the addition of Zn2+(ZnSO4) at different concentrations for 30 min at 24 °C and SDS-PAGE analysis of the pellets and supernatants of the incubation reactions. Leptomycin B was dissolved in Me2SO and used at 250 nm concentration. All coprecipitates were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE after boiling in SDS sample buffer with exception of those reactions shown in Fig. 6 that were analyzed in a 12% SDS-PAGE. When applicable, the proteasome inhibitors, lactacystine and MG132 (Biomol), were used at 20 nm and 20 μm, respectively. For purification of retinal 110-kDa ZnF-binding protein, analytical reactions were scaled up to ∼500-fold between 18 15-ml conical tubes. The washings of coprecipitates were scaled up accordingly, and the divalent cations, Ca2+ and Mg2+, were omitted in the regular washing buffer (2Ferreira P. Yunfei C. Schick D. Roepman R. J. Biol.

After subsequent washing the samples were supplemented with 50 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, and 1 mm TPEN and were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. The reactions were subjected to rapid centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 1 min) and the supernatant was collected. To avoid contamination of GST beads along with GST-fused protein, CytoSignal-spin filters (CytoSignal, CA) were used to filtrate the supernatant through a mesh that retains the contaminating glutathioneS-agarose beads. The remaining beads were again incubated with EDTA, DTT, and TPEN, and the supernatant was collected similarly as described. Eluted protein was concentrated in Centricon-50 and boiled in SDS sample buffer for 3 min and loaded on 6% SDS-PAGE. This was stained with Fast Stain followed by electroelution of P110 bands and mock (blank) neighboring gel bands into Centricons. Eluted samples were concentrated and buffer exchanged twice in 100 mmammonium bicarbonate and then lyophilized. 5% (v/v) of the total concentrated and purified protein was resolved in SDS-PAGE in parallel with coprecipitates of analytical retinal binding reactions and analyzed by silver stain as described (2Ferreira P. Yunfei C. Schick D. Roepman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24676-24682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4Ferreira P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 455-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin digestion of the remaining protein and mock sample (1:50 of trypsin:substrate) was carried out overnight in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, at 27 °C. A small aliquot of the trypsin digest mixture was first screened by peptide mass mapping in a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF, Perkin-Elmer Voyager DE-Pro) and compared against protein data bases. The remaining trypsin digest mixture and mock sample were resolved by HPLC on a C18 reverse-phase column. All collected fractions were analyzed by MALDI for identification of purified peptides. Two fractions, numbers 37 and 53, were subjected to Edman degradation. GST-ZnF retinal coprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and Western blot analysis was carried out exactly as described previously (2Ferreira P. Yunfei C. Schick D. Roepman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24676-24682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4Ferreira P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 455-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRM1/exportin-1 (gift from Dr. G. Grosveld) and Ran (Santa Cruz Laboratories) antiserum were used at 1:200 and 1:5,000 dilutions, respectively. Blots were developed in the presence of a chemiluminescent substrate (Super Signal, Pierce) for 5 min. To generate a GST-fused construct containing the Zinc finger cluster domain of bovine RanBP2, RT-PCR was carried out on bovine retinal mRNA with primers against the flanking and conserved domains of bovine Ran-binding domains 1 and 2 (RBD1 andRBD2, Fig. 1, a andb). Analysis of the size of PCR products (Fig. 1 b) and nucleic acid sequence comparison of the bovine ZnF domain with the HeLa counterpart sequence showed that it contained only five out of the eight ZnF motifs previously reported in human RANBP2. (Fig. 2). The 5th and 6th and either the 4th or 7th fingers were absent in bovine retinal RanBP2 (Fig. 2). Moreover, the bovine 4th zinc finger is missing the 2nd cysteine. To investigate whether the lack of these fingers was due to species- or tissue-specific differences in RanBP2, RT-PCR was also performed with the same primers on bovine liver, human, retinal, and HeLa cell mRNAs (Fig. 1 b). These results confirmed that the bovineranBP2 gene encodes a protein with only five zinc fingers in contrast to eight and six present in its human and mouse orthologues, respectively (5Yokoyama N.

https://openalex.org/W1967639969,"Cardiac chamber morphogenesis requires the coordinated growth of both cardiac muscle and endocardial cell lineages. Paracrine growth factors may modulate the coordinated cellular specification and differentiation during cardiac chamber morphogenesis, as suggested by the essential role of endothelial-derived growth factors, neuregulin-1, and insulin-like growth factor-I. Using the whole mouse embryo culture system for delivery of diffusible factors into the cardiac chamber, neuregulin-1 was shown to promote trabeculation of the ventricular wall. Another factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, had no apparent effect by itself. Combined treatment with neuregulin-1 and insulin-like growth factor-I strongly induced DNA synthesis of cardiomyocytes and expansion of both the ventricular compact zone and the atrioventricular cushions leading to chamber growth and maturation. In cultured cardiomyocytes, combined neuregulin-1 and insulin-like growth factor-I also had a synergistic effect to promote DNA synthesis and cellular growth, which were prevented by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Adenoviral delivery of dominant negative Rac1, which acts downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, blocked the effect of combined neuregulin-1/insulin-like growth factor-I treatment. These studies support the concept that the interaction of neuregulin-1 and insulin-like growth factor-I pathways plays an important role in coordinating cardiac chamber morphogenesis and may occur through convergent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase."

Furthermore, primary thymocytes from DFF45 mutant mice are also more resistant to apoptosis than wild-type control cells on exposure to several apoptotic stimuli. Dying DFF45-deficient thymocytes exhibit different morphology than wild-type control cells in that they show reduced degree of chromatin condensation, absent nuclear fragmentation, intranuclear cytoplasmic invagination, and striking nuclear chromatin conglutination after release from disintegrating cells.

Although DFF40 contains an intrinsic DNase activity, both DFF40 and DFF45 are required to generate this activity. DFF45 has been postulated to stabilize the synthesis of DFF40 (38Liu X. Zou H.

Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). On activation of apoptosis, DFF45 is cleaved by caspase-3 at amino acids 117 and 224 and dissociates from DFF40, resulting in the induction of DFF40 nuclease activity (38Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 39Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S.

Activated DFF40 oligomerizes to form a large functional complex that cleaves DNA by introducing double-strand breaks (42Liu X. Zou H. Widlak P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Despite this knowledge, however, whether DFF45 is important for induction of DNA fragmentation in vivo and how DNA fragmentation plays a role in execution and regulation of apoptosis remain unclear. We have used the previously generated DFF45 mutant mice to address these issues (43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 44Cory S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12077-12079Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We found that DFF45 is ubiquitously expressed throughout mouse development. Moreover, DFF45-deficient thymocytes are resistant to DNA fragmentation after in vivo dexamethasone treatment. Furthermore, primary thymocytes from DFF45 mutant mice exhibit more resistance to apoptosis than wild-type control cells after exposure to several apoptotic stimuli. Dying DFF45-deficient thymocytes also show different dying morphology than wild-type control cells in that they show a reduced degree of chromatin condensation, absent nuclear fragmentation, intranuclear cytoplasmic invagination, and conglutination of liberated chromatin. These results indicate that DFF45 is essential during normal apoptosis, and its mutation could have adverse effects in vivo. Mice homozygous for the DFF45 gene mutation were produced by crossing heterozygous mutant animals in our mouse colony and were identified by Southern blotting as described (43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DFF45 mutant and wild-type control littermates 8–12 weeks of age were used for all subsequent analyses. Mouse poly(A) RNA blots representing embryonic and adult stages of development were purchased fromCLONTECH. Northern hybridization was performed as described using a DFF45 gene-specific probe that contains DNA sequences from the first three exons (43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 45Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the in vivo DNA fragmentation analysis, thymocytes were prepared from dexamethasone-treated (12.5 μg/kg body weight) DFF45 mutant and wild-type mice at different time points as described (43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Untreated thymocytes from mutant and control mice were used as 0-h controls. For the in vitro DNA fragmentation analysis, primary thymocytes from both DFF45 mutant and wild-type mice were isolated and resuspended at 2 × 106/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum and were cultured in the absence or presence of dexamethasone (1 μm), etoposide (50 μm), or staurosporine (2 μm), respectively, for different lengths of time at 37 °C (43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DNA samples were then extracted by overnight incubation at 56 °C in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml freshly made proteinase K). These DNA samples were recovered by isopropanol precipitation, resuspended in Tris-EDTA-RNase, analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining as described (43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cell viability on activation of apoptosis was determined using two different methods. Thymocytes were collected, and viable cells were counted using the trypan blue exclusion method after dexamethasone or etoposide treatment at different time points. Viability of thymocytes after dexamethasone, etoposide, or staurosporine treatment was also determined by flow cytometric analysis counting 20,000 events using a FACSCalibur system (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) at the Children's Hospital Research Foundation. Viable cells are negative populations for both FITC-annexin V and propidium iodide staining (Immunotech; Refs. 43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 46Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Cell viability determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay was analyzed by Tukey's multiple comparison for the pairwise comparison between wild-type and DFF45-deficient thymocytes at different time points. In addition, Bartlet's test was also performed to ensure that the underlying assumption about the homogeneity of the variance for Tukey's multiple comparison was appropriate. Cell viability determined by the FACS analysis was analyzed by pairwise t test between wild-type and DFF45 deficient thymocytes for different drug treatments. Primary DFF45-deficient and wild-type control thymocytes were isolated and were treated with 1 μm dexamethasone for 6 or 16 h, respectively. Treated thymocytes were harvested and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm. The cell pellets were fixed in cacodylate-buffered 2% glutaraldehyde and prepared for electron microscopy by standard methods (6Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar, 46Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Thymocytes were classified as normal or degenerate using the following grading system: stage 1, early nuclear chromatin condensation with nuclear clefts in otherwise intact cells; stage 2, moderate nuclear chromatin condensation with intact cytoplasm and cell membrane; and stage 3, advanced nuclear chromatin condensation with disintegrating cytoplasm. Comparable stages of degeneration of DFF45-deficient thymocytes were judged by their cytoplasmic changes. Also recorded were preservation or absence of nuclear fragmentation, intranuclear cytoplasmic invagination, and fusion of chromatin from disintegrated cells. To assess the function of DFF45 in vivo, we first performed a Northern blot analysis of poly(A) RNA isolated from different stages of mouse development using a DFF45 gene-specific probe (43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, 2J. Zhang and M. Xu, unpublished results. two species of DFF45 mRNA ∼2.4 and 3.8 kilobases in sizes are detected, and they are detectable as early as embryonic days 7–17 (left) or as late as 18 months of age (right). Moreover, DFF45 is expressed in multiple tissues including the brain, spleen, thymus, and liver in adult mice. Thus, DFF45 is ubiquitously expressed throughout mouse development, suggesting it may also function during the entire period. We previously demonstrated that cultured primary DFF45-deficient thymocytes, splenocytes, and neutrophils exhibit resistance to DNA fragmentation in response to various apoptotic stimuli (43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To determine whether the lack of DFF40 nuclease activity results in changes in DNA fragmentation in vivo, we treated both DFF45 mutant and wild-type mice with dexamethasone for different periods. Genomic DNA samples were then isolated from thymi from all treated mice and resolved by gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2, wild-type thymocytes start to exhibit typical nucleosomal DNA fragmentation after 4 h of in vivo dexamethasone treatment. Moreover, the degree of DNA fragmentation in wild-type thymocytes increases with longer periods of treatment. In sharp contrast, DFF45-deficient thymocytes are resistant to DNA fragmentation in response to the same treatment. Thus, DFF45 is required for DNA fragmentation in vivo on apoptotic stimulation. It has been shown that cell nucleus and DNA fragmentation are not required for apoptosis under certain conditions (47Schulze-Osthoff K. Walczak H. Droge W. Krammer P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). We also observed caspase 3 activation and degradation of caspase substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (48Cuvillier O. Rosenthal D.S. Smulson M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2910-2916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and nuclear lamin B (48Cuvillier O. Rosenthal D.S. Smulson M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2910-2916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 49Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufman S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) in DFF45-deficient cells with exposure to various apoptotic stimuli.2These observations suggest that apoptosis in DFF45-deficient cells could occur despite the resistance to DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. However, it is not known whether apoptosis occurs at a reduced level in DFF45-deficient cells, which could have adverse effects in vivo. To address this issue, we compared the extent of cell death in DFF45-deficient and wild-type cells in response to several apoptotic stimuli. Specifically, we isolated primary thymocytes from DFF45 mutant and wild-type mice and exposed these cells to dexamethasone, etoposide, or staurosporine for different periods. We then measured the viability of these treated thymocytes using both the trypan blue exclusion and FITC-annexin V/propidium iodide staining method. When the percentage of viable thymocytes was determined by trypan blue exclusion, a decrease in cell viability for both DFF45-deficient and wild-type control thymocytes was observed with increasing length of apoptotic exposure. However, viability of thymocytes from the DFF45 mutant mice is significantly higher than that of the wild-type mice after 24 h of dexamethasone (Fig. 3 A; p < 0.01) or etoposide treatment (p < 0.01; data not shown). These results suggest that DFF45-deficient cells are more resistant to cell death than the wild-type cells after exposure to apoptotic stimulation. To confirm further this finding, we assayed for cell viability by staining a fraction of the treated thymocytes using FITC-annexin V/propidium iodide and FACS analyses (43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 46Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, DFF45-deficient thymocytes exhibit a significantly higher percent viability than that of the wild-type control thymocytes after 16 and 24 h of dexamethasone treatment (p < 0.01). The difference in viability between DFF45-deficient and wild-type control thymocytes after 16 h of dexamethasone treatment may be attributable to a difference in detection methods. Further analyses showed also that viability of thymocytes from the DFF45 mutant mice is significantly higher than that from the wild-type mice after 24 h of exposure to etoposide (Fig. 3 C;p < 0.01) or staurosporine (Fig. 3 C;p < 0.05). Therefore, DFF45-deficient cells are more resistant to cell death than normal control cells on activation of apoptosis. Moreover, the appearance of FITC-annexin V+/propidium iodide− cells from both DFF45 mutant and wild-type mice suggests that the early plasma membrane changes of apoptosis can still happen in the absence of DFF45. To be certain that the exposure to various apoptotic stimuli were effective in inducing apoptosis, we isolated DNA samples from the above-treated thymocytes and analyzed them on agarose gels. As shown in Fig. 4, the DNA samples from dexamethasone-treated thymocytes from DFF45 mutant mice were devoid of DNA fragmentation, similar to those from the untreated cells. In contrast, the DNA samples from wild-type cells exhibited increasing amount of DNA laddering after longer dexamethasone treatment. Similar results were obtained with etoposide- or staurosporine-treated cells (data not shown). Thus, treatments from these three drugs produced expected DNA fragmentation patterns in the wild-type thymocytes. It has been shown that DFF45 and DFF40 are involved in inducing chromatin condensation on exposure to apoptotic stimulation (40Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To detect possible morphological consequences of DFF45 mutation in apoptosis, we performed electron microscopy using primary thymocytes that had been treated with dexamethasone. We found that wild-type thymocytes exhibit highly condensed chromatin (Fig. 5, stages2 and 3) and cytoplasmic disintegration (Fig. 5, stage 3) on exposure to dexamethasone. In sharp contrast, DFF45-deficient thymocytes exhibit disaggregated and poorly condensed chromatin and prominent intranuclear cytoplasmic invagination (Fig. 5, stages 2 and 3). Moreover, whereas wild-type thymocytes exhibit nuclear fragmentation or apoptotic body formation, DFF45-deficient thymocytes do not (Fig. 5, stage 2) after dexamethasone treatment. A quantitative survey of one electron microscopic field each for wild-type and DFF45 deficient thymocytes indicates that 15 of 165 (9%) dying wild-type thymocytes showed nuclear fragmentation compared with 0 of 160 (0%) DFF45-deficient thymocytes. Finally, dying DFF45 deficient thymocytes exhibit a remarkable tendency to fusion of nuclear chromatin liberated from disintegrated cells, whereas dying wild-type thymocytes do not (Fig. 5, stage 3, lower panel). A semiquantitative survey of 500 thymocytes from the electron micrographs indicates that a higher percentage of treated wild-type cells are in the more advanced stages of apoptosis than DFF45-deficient cells. This is consistent with our previous observation that DFF45-deficient cells are more resistant to apoptosis than wild-type control cells. We found that DFF45 is ubiquitously expressed during early embryonic development and in adult tissues, suggesting an important role of DFF45 throughout mouse development. Interestingly, two forms of mRNA for DFF45 were detected, and they presumably encode the long and short forms of DFF45 (inhibitor of caspase-activated nuclease-L and -S, respectively; Ref. 50Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Whereas the long form of DFF45 likely acts as both a chaperone and an inhibitor for DFF40 function, the role of the short form of DFF45 remains unknown (38Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 39Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar, 40Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 41Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 43Zhang J. Liu X.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Using the previously generated DFF45 mutant mice, we found that DFF45-deficient thymocytes exhibit more resistance to cell death than wild-type control thymocytes on activation of apoptosis. This is the first experimental demonstration that DNA fragmentation factor(s) could modulate the overall apoptotic process in response to various apoptotic stimuli. This may not be surprising, because double-stranded DNA breaks that are generated by DFF40 could themselves be apoptotic signals (42Liu X. Zou H. Widlak P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of DNA double-stranded breaks in DFF45-deficient thymocytes results in a deficiency of signaling, leading to more resistance to apoptosis than wild-type cells. Moreover, DNA fragmentation may be the true point of no return in cell death in some cases. It could be argued that degraded proteins or even cell organelles can all be repaired; such is not true for nucleosomal degradation of DNA. Thus, it is important that DNA fragmentation serves as a final modulation step in apoptosis. Recent work showed that factors downstream of activated caspases can be critical for active apoptosis (51Samejima K. Tone S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Whether DFF is part of the downstream factors remains to be examined. Rather than a complete blockade of programmed cell death in the absence of DFF45 and DNA fragmentation, we observed that DFF45-deficient cells are quantitatively more resistant to apoptosis than wild-type cells. Whether this reflects a slower rate of cell death or a higher percentage of cell survival in the DFF45-deficient cells than in the wild-type cells remains to be determined. Regardless, the more resistance to apoptosis may have adverse functional consequencesin vivo when timely apoptosis is needed. Future detailed analysis of physiological function in the DFF45 mutant mice and how DFF45 mutant mice respond to adverse conditions that demand appropriate apoptosis in wild-type mice will provide useful clues. What might be the underlying mechanisms for the observed resistance to programmed cell death in DFF45-deficient cells? One possibility is that activation of DFF45 feedback regulates one or more steps in the apoptosis process. A thorough comparison of the time course of cytochrome c release, activation of various caspases, and cleavage of various caspase substrates, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, nuclear lamins, and various plasma membrane or cytosolic structural proteins that contribute to morphological changes of apoptosis process in response to apoptotic stimuli, will provide initial answers. Alternatively, the responses to double-stranded DNA breaks are absent in DFF45-deficient cells, thus contributing to the apparent resistance to apoptosis in these cells. We have made DFF45-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and these cells will permit us to address these and other mechanistic questions directly in a more homogenous cell population. We found that DFF45-deficient thymocytes are resistant to DNA fragmentation, whereas wild-type thymocytes exhibit standard DNA laddering on exposure to dexamethasone. These in vivoresults substantiate and extend our previous finding that DFF45 is essential for DNA fragmentation in vitro (43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 44Cory S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12077-12079Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Together, these results establish that DFF45 plays a critical role in vivo in internucleosomal cleavage of DNA on exposure to apoptotic stimulation. Moreover, these findings argue that there are unlikely additional mechanisms, such as the existence of DFF45 homologs or other nuclease systems, responsible for degrading DNA to nucleosomal sizes in thymocytes in vivo. Whether the DFF45 mutation affects chromatin degradation into 30–50-kilobase pair fragments remains to be seen (52Montague J.W. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6677-6684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 53Sakahira H. Enari M. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our electron microscopic studies demonstrate that DFF45-deficient thymocytes exhibit strikingly different dying morphology than wild-type cells on induction of apoptosis. Features observed only in DFF45-deficient cells include poor chromatin condensation, intranuclear cytoplasmic invagination, fusion of nuclear chromatin released from disintegrating cells, and the absence of normal nuclear fragmentation or apoptotic body formation. These findings support and extend previous reports that DFF45 is essential for chromatin condensation during apoptosis (40Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 43Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is likely that because of conglutination of liberated chromatin and the absence of nuclear fragmentation, phagocytosis would be altered. The consequence of the possible abnormal phagocytosis is under investigation. Nagata and colleagues (53Sakahira H. Enari M. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) recently reported that chromatin condensation could still occur on activation of apoptosis when DFF45 activity is inhibited in a dominant negative transfection system. One possible explanation of this finding is that different cell systems may contain a different set of factors for inducing chromatin condensation. Sahara et al. (54Sahara S. Aoto M. Eguchi Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 401: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) reported recently that in addition to DFF, other proteins could also serve as chromatin condensation factors on activation of apoptosis. Thus, DFF45 and DFF40 may be important in chromatin condensation in mouse thymocytes but may not be in human Jurkat cells. Another possible explanation is that the caspase-resistant DFF45 inhibits the nuclease activity of DFF40 but not the chromatin condensation activity of DFF40 because of conformational and stoichiometric differences between the caspase-resistant DFF45-DFF40 complex and the wild-type DFF45-DFF40 complex. The continuous use of DFF45 mutant mice as a model system will help answer these and other questions regarding how DFF45 might function in vivo in the near future.

https://openalex.org/W2150206039,"The Gab1-docking protein has been shown to regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PI3K activity and potentiate nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced survival in PC12 cells. Here, we investigated the potential of Gab1 to induce neurite outgrowth and DNA synthesis, two other important aspects of NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells and NGF-independent survival. We generated a recombinant adenovirus encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope-tagged Gab1 and expressed this protein in PC12 cells. HA-Gab1 was constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in PC12 cells and induced the phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase. HA-Gab1-stimulated a 10-fold increase in neurite outgrowth in the absence of NGF and a 5-fold increase in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. HA-Gab1 also stimulated DNA synthesis and caused NGF-independent survival in PC12 cells. Finally, we found that HA-Gab1-induced neuritogenesis was completely suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) activity and 50% suppressed by inhibition of PI3K activity. In contrast, HA-Gab1-stimulated cell survival was efficiently suppressed only by inhibition of both PI3K and MEK activities. These results indicate that Gab1 is capable of mediating differentiation, DNA synthesis, and cell survival and uses both PI3K and MEK signaling pathways to achieve its effects.

HA-Gab1 also stimulated DNA synthesis and caused NGF-independent survival in PC12 cells. Finally, we found that HA-Gab1-induced neuritogenesis was completely suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) activity and 50% suppressed by inhibition of PI3K activity. In contrast, HA-Gab1-stimulated cell survival was efficiently suppressed only by inhibition of both PI3K and MEK activities. These results indicate that Gab1 is capable of mediating differentiation, DNA synthesis, and cell survival and uses both PI3K and MEK signaling pathways to achieve its effects. nerve growth factor growth-associated binder-1 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase phospholipase C-γ1 growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 insulin receptor substrate Src homology 2 Src homology 3 SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide β-galactosidase hemagglutinin multiplicity of infection protein kinase B Nerve growth factor (NGF)1 is a potent inducer of cell survival and differentiation in neurons and neural tumor cells (1Kaplan D.R.

NGF mediates its effects by binding to and stimulating the activity of the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase (5Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F.

The activated TrkA receptor then recruits a series of cytoplasmic proteins to docking sites consisting of phosphorylated tyrosines in specific sequence contexts. These proteins include Shc, PLC-γ1, SHP-1, APS-1, SH2-B, and FRS-2 (1Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 7Qian X. Riccio A.

The major function of substrate recruitment to TrkA is to couple this receptor to a number of intracellular signaling pathways. For example, the Shc binding site on TrkA is required for NGF-induced activation of Ras and PI3K (9Baxter R.M. Cohen P. Obermeier A. Ullrich A. Downes C.P. Doza Y.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Hallberg B. Ashcroft M. Loeb D.M. Kaplan D.R. Downward J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas both the Shc and PLC-γ1 binding sites on TrkA are required for maximal activation of MAPK (11Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been found that the Gab1-docking protein, which can bind both GRB2, a regulator of Ras activity, and PI3K, associates with the majority of the activated PI3K activity in NGF-treated PC12 cells (12Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich R. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although Gab1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to TrkA activation, Gab1 does not associate directly with TrkA (13Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Thus, both Ras and PI3K signaling pathways, which are required for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and survival, respectively, are regulated by direct receptor-substrate interactions through Shc, APS-1, SH2-B, and FRS-2 and by indirect receptor-Gab1 mechanisms.Gab1 (growth-associated binder-1) was originally cloned as a GRB2-associated protein from a human glial tumor expression library and also through yeast two-hybrid screens using the Met receptor tyrosine kinase as bait (13Weidner K.M.

Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Gab1 belongs to family of docking proteins consisting of Gab2, IRS-1, IRS-2, and DOS that share sequence homology between their single pleckstrin homology domains and that have been shown to link cell surface receptors to intracellular signaling proteins (14Holgado-Madruga M.

Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Gab1 has multiple SH2 and SH3 binding sites for PI3K and SHP-2 and for the adapter proteins GRB2, NCK, and CRK (13Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W.

Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Gab1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by a variety of cell surface receptors, including the insulin, epidermal growth factor, c-Met, and c-erbB2 receptors, B-cell antigen, and the gp130 subunit of cytokine receptors (16Rocchi S.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 then associates with downstream signaling proteins such as GRB2, the p85 subunit of PI3K and SHP-2 in various cell systems (12Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K.

For example, Gab1 mediates branching and alveolar morphogenesis of Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial and EpH4 mammary epithelial cells (13Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J.

Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In addition, Gab1 reduces the concentration of NGF required for cell survival via the three PI3K binding sites found in the protein (12Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich R. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).The observation that Gab1, through binding of GRB2 and PI3K, links TrkA to both MAPK- and PI3K-signaling pathways led us to ask whether Gab1 has the potential to induce other neurotrophic factor responses, including neurite outgrowth, survival, and the stimulation of DNA synthesis in PC12 cells. We find that Gab1 overexpression in PC12 cells via recombinant adenovirus mimics neuritogenesis and survival effects of NGF and stimulates one round of DNA synthesis. Gab1 induces neuritogenesis and survival of PC12 cells by activating both MEK/MAPK and PI3K pathways. Thus, Gab1 is a multipotential signaling protein that is capable of mimicking several of the most evident biological and biochemical responses of cells to NGF.DISCUSSIONGab1, an IRS-1 family member, has previously been shown to be phosphorylated on tyrosine in NGF-treated cells and to bind the majority of NGF-activated PI3K (12Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich R. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of Gab1 reduced the concentration of NGF required for PC12 cell survival in a manner dependent upon the integrity of the PI3K binding sites (12Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich R. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Holgado-Madruga et al. (12Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich R. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) propose that Gab1 plays a major role in linking TrkA to PI3K activation and cell survival responses. In this report, we demonstrate that Gab1 overexpression in PC12 cells not only enhances NGF-dependent survival but on its own, induces cell survival, neurite outgrowth, and DNA synthesis. Thus Gab1 has the potential to regulate these three most evident phenotypic effects of NGF. The differences between the effects of Gab1 reported here and the previous report from Holgado-Madruga et al. (12Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich R. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) are most likely due to the higher levels of Gab1 expression that we achieve using recombinant adenovirus, which we estimate as approximately 10-fold more than endogenous Gab1 expression (at an m.o.i. of 100). Our study therefore assesses the potential of Gab1 to induce NGF-like responses in PC12 cells. Our results suggest that Gab1 can play major roles in cell survival, neuritogenesis, and DNA synthesis responses.Gab1, expressed using recombinant adenovirus, was tyrosine-phosphorylated in the absence of NGF addition to cells. Furthermore, adenovirus-expressed Gab1 was capable of inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation or activation of signaling proteins, cell survival, and neurite outgrowth in untreated PC12 cells. This may be due to tyrosine phosphorylation of exogenously expressed Gab1 by factors in serum such as insulin-like growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor (14Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) or to limiting amounts of a tyrosine phosphatase that may function to keep Gab1 in an “off” position. We have recently observed that the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase may play such a role for the TrkA. 2N. Marsh, C. Dubrevill, and D. R. Kaplan, unpublished data. Constitutive, ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and its association with signaling proteins such as PI3K has been previously observed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells overexpressing Gab1 (13Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and in PC12 cells (14Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar).How does Gab1 induce effects as diverse as cell survival, neuritogenesis, and DNA synthesis? Gab1 has been shown to bind a series of signaling proteins in vitro and in vivo, including GRB2, PLC-γ1, PI3K, and SHP-2. We and others have shown that these proteins can mediate cell survival, neurite outgrowth, and DNA synthesis in PC12 cells and other cell types (1Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 33Klippel A. Escobedo M-A. Wachowicz M.S. Apell G. Brown T.W. Giedlin M.A. Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the ability of Gab1 to enhance NGF-induced survival is dependent upon Gab1 association with PI3K. The phosphorylated YMXM motifs in Gab1 presumably bind and activate PI3K, analogous to PI3K association and activation by insulin-activated IRS-1 (37Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We show that cell survival by Gab1 requires, in part, PI3K activity and that Gab1 causes the phosphorylation of two of the major targets of NGF-induced PI3K activity, the serine/threonine kinases Akt/PKB and p70 S6K. In sympathetic and cerebellar neurons and in a hippocampal cell line, PI3K mediates neurotrophic factor-induced cell survival by activating Akt/PKB (38Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J.

Akt/PKB may in turn promote cell survival by suppressing GSK-3 activity (41Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) or by inducing the phosphorylation and inactivation of the BAD, procaspase, or forkhead apoptotic proteins (42Downward J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our unpublished results indicate that Akt/PKB activity is required for NGF and serum-induced survival of PC12 cells and that Akt/PKB promotes survival by inhibiting the activity of an MEKK-JNK cell death pathway. 3M. Boudreau and D. R. Kaplan, unpublished data. The survival pathway regulated by MEK/MAPK is not yet defined in PC12 cells.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Gab1 may stimulate MEK/MAPK activity by binding to GRB2, an event that stimulates the activity of the SOS/Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway (11Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Overexpressed Gab1 binds GRB2 in PC12 cells (Ref. 12Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K.

Gab1-induced neuritogenesis was completely suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of MEK activity, suggesting that MEK/MAPK activity is responsible for transmitting Gab1-mediated neurite outgrowth signals. However, Gab1-induced neurite outgrowth also was suppressed 50% by inhibition of PI3K activity. Several groups, including ours, have observed that PI3K may play a role in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (31Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S.

The later study showed that overexpression of Gab1 in NIH-3T3 cells inhibited the activity of the MAPK pathway, possibly due to Gab1 competing with SOS for binding to GRB2, and thus preventing GRB2/SOS/Ras/Raf-1-induced activation of MEK/MAPK. Three other reports, however, show that the MAPK pathway is stimulated by Gab1 overexpression, including those of Weidner et al. (13Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, Nishida et al. (Nishida) in 293T cells, and Takahashi-Tezukaet al.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4109-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) in lymphoid cells. The ability of Gab1 to activate or suppress MAPK activity may be a function of whether GRB2 is present in sufficient quantities to allow GRB2 coupling to both Gab1 and SOS.Gab1 appeared to induce a single round of DNA synthesis without stimulating cell proliferation in serum-free medium, an observation similar to that of NGF treatment of PC12 cells (32Rudkin B.B.

We therefore suggest that Gab1-stimulated PI3K activity regulates the induction of DNA synthesis and that a Gab1/PI3K pathway may be responsible for the mitogenic effects of NGF that are observed immediately after NGF treatment of PC12 cells (48Burstein D.E. Greene L.A. Dev. Biol. 1982; 94: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Our results indicate that Gab1 is capable of mediating neurite outgrowth, DNA synthesis, and cell survival responses and uses both PI3K- and MEK-signaling pathways to achieve its effects. Gab1 could either function as a primary Trk effector or provide an additional mechanism for activating PI3K and MEK/MAPK that normally occurs through the Shc and PLC-γ1 binding sites on Trk. The binding of GRB2 to the Shc site is thought to be a primary means used by Trk to activate PI3K and Ras (9Baxter R.M. Cohen P. Obermeier A. Ullrich A. Downes C.P. Doza Y.N. Eur. J.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas the PLC-γ1 binding site, together with the Shc binding site, participates in the activation of MAPK (11Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 by NGF-activated Trk and the subsequent activation by Gab1 of PI3K and MEK/MAPK-signaling pathways may be a major alternative mechanism used by NGF to stimulate cell survival and neuritogenesis. Nerve growth factor (NGF)1 is a potent inducer of cell survival and differentiation in neurons and neural tumor cells (1Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar,2Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). For example, NGF treatment of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, a model system for sympathetic neuron differentiation, results in the elaboration of neurites, induction of a single round of DNA synthesis, and cell survival (3Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 4Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar). NGF mediates its effects by binding to and stimulating the activity of the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase (5Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F.

Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The activated TrkA receptor then recruits a series of cytoplasmic proteins to docking sites consisting of phosphorylated tyrosines in specific sequence contexts. These proteins include Shc, PLC-γ1, SHP-1, APS-1, SH2-B, and FRS-2 (1Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 7Qian X. Riccio A.

The major function of substrate recruitment to TrkA is to couple this receptor to a number of intracellular signaling pathways. For example, the Shc binding site on TrkA is required for NGF-induced activation of Ras and PI3K (9Baxter R.M. Cohen P. Obermeier A. Ullrich A. Downes C.P. Doza Y.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Hallberg B. Ashcroft M. Loeb D.M. Kaplan D.R. Downward J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas both the Shc and PLC-γ1 binding sites on TrkA are required for maximal activation of MAPK (11Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been found that the Gab1-docking protein, which can bind both GRB2, a regulator of Ras activity, and PI3K, associates with the majority of the activated PI3K activity in NGF-treated PC12 cells (12Holgado-Madruga M.

Although Gab1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to TrkA activation, Gab1 does not associate directly with TrkA (13Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W.

https://openalex.org/W2025755419,"Nurr1, a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, was recently demonstrated to be of critical importance in the developing central nervous system, where it is required for the generation of midbrain dopamine cells. Nuclear receptors encompass a transcriptional activation function (activation function 2; AF2) within their carboxyl-terminal domains important for ligand-induced transcriptional activation. Since a Nurr1 ligand remains to be identified, the role of the Nurr1 AF2 region in transcriptional activation is unclear. However, here we show that the Nurr1 AF2 contributes to constitutive activation independent of exogenously added ligands in human embryo kidney 293 cells and in neural cell lines. Extensive mutagenesis indicated a crucial role of the AF2 core region for transactivation but also identified unique features differing from previously characterized receptors. In addition, Nurr1 did not appear to interact with, and was not stimulated by, several previously identified coactivators such as the steroid receptor coactivator 1. In contrast, adenovirus protein E1A, stably expressed in 293 cells, was shown to contribute to AF2-dependent activation. Finally, while the AF2 core of RXR is required for ligand-induced transcriptional activation by Nurr1-RXR heterodimers, the functional integrity of Nurr1 AF2 core is not critical. These results establish that the ligand binding domain of Nurr1 has intrinsic capacity for transcriptional activation depending on cell type and mode of DNA binding. Furthermore, these results are consistent with the possibility that gene expression in the central nervous system can be modulated by an as yet unidentified ligand interacting with the ligand binding domain of Nurr1.

Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar, 2Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G.

In addition, a large number of structurally related proteins, referred to as orphan receptors, belong to the same superfamily of transcription factors but lack identified ligands. NRs bind to DNA sequences termed hormone response elements (HREs) in the vicinity of genes that they regulate. Such HREs are often composed of repeats of a common half-site sequence recognized by receptor dimers. While, for example, steroid hormone receptors bind repeats as homodimers, several other NRs, including receptors for retinoic acid (RAR), thyroid hormone (TR), and vitamin D, bind to DNA as heterodimers with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor, RXR (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). Yet an additional category of receptors bind their cognate response elements as monomers, recognizing additional nucleotides upstream of the minimal consensus half-site sequence. NRs encompass several functional domains including a well conserved DNA binding domain and a somewhat less conserved carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD). Two major regions essential for transcriptional activation, situated in the amino-terminal (AF1) and carboxyl-terminal (AF2) regions, respectively, have been identified by using mutated receptor derivatives in transcription assays in vivo andin vitro. The AF2 region plays a key role in the ligand-induced conformational transition of the LBD, which, upon ligand binding, results in activation of transcription. A region close to the carboxyl terminus contains an amphipathic α-helix, which has proven to be of critical importance for ligand-induced transcriptional activation and is referred to as the AF2 core. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies have yielded a relatively clear understanding of the ligand-induced structural transition occurring within NRs. Notably, these analyses have demonstrated that ligand binding results in a conformational change involving repositioning of the AF2 core α-helix (4Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 5Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The AF2 region interacts with auxiliary proteins termed coactivators, which mediate the transcriptional activation of liganded receptors (7Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar,8Freedman L.P. Cell. 1999; 97: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). An important group of coactivators is the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) and closely related proteins referred to as the p160 family of coactivators. These proteins are components of a multiprotein complex including cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP)/p300 and the histone acetylase p300/CBP-associated factor (9Montminy M. Nature. 1997; 387: 654-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Thus, the activities of these proteins result in localized modulation of chromatin structure as a consequence of increased histone acetylation in the vicinity of hormone-regulated target genes. An additional and distinct coactivator multiprotein complex, which apparently lacks histone acetylase activity, was recently identified and found to enhance transcription by liganded thyroid hormone and vitamin D receptors in in vitrotranscription assays (10Yua C.

A specific motif composed of the amino acid sequence LXXLL in NR coactivators has been demonstrated to interact directly with the LBDs of liganded receptors (12Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M.

Reciprocally, mutations introduced in the carboxyl-terminal domain of NRs, in particular in the AF2 core, which abolish interactions with coactivators, have defined complementary surfaces in NR LBDs (6Darimont B.D.

Nurr1 (NR4A2) belongs to the family of NRs but lacks a known ligand and is therefore referred to as an orphan receptor (22Law S.W. Conneely O.M. DeMayo F.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Nurr1 and its close relatives NGFI-B (NR4A1) and Nor1 (NR4A3) are unique by being encoded by immediate early genes that are rapidly induced when cells are stimulated by, for example, growth factors (23Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 24Ohkura N. Hijikuro M. Yamamoto A. Miki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Since these cells degenerate in patients with Parkinson's disease, Nurr1 is a potentially important drug target in this as well as in other disorders involving dopamine neurotransmission. Nurr1 and its close relatives NGFI-B and Nor1 bind as monomers to a consensus binding site preceded by two additional adenines (AAAGGTCA; NGFI-B binding response element (NBRE)) and function as constitutively active transcription factors in various cell lines (29Wilson T.E.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In addition, Nurr1 and NGFI-B, but not Nor1, form heterodimers with RXR that bind to direct repeats of the consensus half-site sequence AGGTCA spaced by 5 nucleotides (31Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 32Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M.

For example, such heterodimers efficiently recognize a retinoic acid response element in the RARβ2 gene promoter (βRE), which is composed of a direct repeat spaced by 5 nucleotides. In these heterodimers, RXR is permissive to ligand-induced activation, whereas several other heterodimerization partners, including RAR, have been shown to inhibit the inducibility of RXR (31Perlmann T.

Moreover, only limited information is available on the structural requirements for transcriptional activation. In particular, it is important to understand whether the AF2 region of Nurr1 plays a role in transcriptional activation, since such information could give clues regarding the potential for ligand-induced regulation of Nurr1 in the developing and adult central nervous system. The results presented here provide evidence demonstrating unique properties for the AF2 region in transcriptional activation depending both on cell type specificity and mode of DNA binding. Together, these data suggest the involvement of unique coactivators and/or Nurr1 ligands in the developing and mature central nervous system. The luciferase reporters used in transfection experiments contain three copies of the human RARβ2 gene promoter retinoic acid response element (31Perlmann T. Jansson L.

The plasmid PML005, used for expressing E1A in transfections, contains nucleotides 1–1773 of genomic adenovirus type2. Detailed cloning information can be obtained upon request. Human chorion carcinoma JEG-3 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed in quadruplicate in 24-well plates by the calcium phosphate method, as described previously (42Botling J. Castro D.S. Öberg F. Nilsson K. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Each well was transfected with 100 ng of reporter plasmid, 100 ng of receptor expression vector, and 200 ng of pCMX-βgal reference plasmid containing a bacterial β-galactosidase gene. Additions to each well were adjusted to contain constant amounts of DNA and of pCMX expression vector. After 6–8 h, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium was added containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum and RXR ligand (SR11237 at 1 μm or other concentration where indicated) when necessary. The cells were harvested after a 36-h incubation and lysed, and extracts were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity in a microplate luminometer/photometer reader (Lucy-1; Anthos, Salzburg, Austria). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed as for JEG-3 cells, except that the cells were incubated with the calcium phosphate precipitate overnight. Mouse c17.2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum. Transfections were performed in quadruplicate in 12-well plates by the calcium phosphate method. Two days prior to transfection, cells were seeded at a density of 200 × 103 cells/well. Each well was treated with 400 ng of the indicated expression vector, 200 ng of reporter plasmid, and 200 ng of pRSV-AP reference plasmid containing the alkaline phosphatase gene. Cells were exposed to calcium phosphate precipitate for 8–10 h, and then fresh medium was added. The cells were harvested after a 24-h incubation and lysed, and medium was saved for AP activity measurement. Extracts were assayed for luciferase activity, and values were normalized to alkaline phosphatase activity. Proteins were made by coupled in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TNT, Promega). For gel mobility retardation assays (31Perlmann T. Jansson L.

The buffer contained 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sollentuna, Sweden). Probe (0.2–0.5 ng), 32P-labeled by a fill-in reaction with the Klenow fragment, with a specific activity of about 3–5 × 108 cpm/μg, was added to the reaction and incubated on ice for 20 min. The mixtures were then loaded onto 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE running buffer (0.045 m Tris borate, 0.002 m EDTA). After electrophoreses, gels were dried for autoradiography. The following HREs and their complements were32P-labeled and used as probes: βRE, agcttaaggGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCActcgcat and NBRE, agcttgagttttaAAAGGTCAtgctcaattt. Members of the NGFI-B/Nurr1/Nor1 subfamily of orphan NRs have been shown to constitutively activate transcription as monomers. When assessing transcriptional activation, we noted a significant difference in transactivation efficiency between Nurr1, NGFI-B, and Nor1 monomers in different cell lines. In human embryo kidney 293 cells, Nurr1 activated a reporter gene containing three NBREs upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter several times more efficiently than both NGFI-B and Nor1 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, Nurr1 was much less active in human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells, whereas NGFI-B and Nor1 showed similar levels of activity as in 293 cells. The efficient transactivation by Nurr1 monomers in 293 cells was also apparent when expressing a derivative of Nurr1 (Gal4-Nurr1) containing the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 fused in frame to the LBD of Nurr1 (Fig. 1 B). This is interesting to note, since previous studies have demonstrated that in NGFI-B monomers, activation depends on AF1 within the amino-terminal domain of the receptor, while the carboxyl-terminal AF2 domain is dispensable for transcriptional activation (43Paulsen R.E. Weaver C.A. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16491-16496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Rey-Hei C. Blenis J. Lau L.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast, GAL4-NGFI-B and Gal4-Nor1 were significantly less active in 293 cells, and in JEG-3 cells none of the Gal4-fused LBDs were active (Fig. 1 B). These results demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of Nurr1 contains a region that contributes to activation in a cell type-dependent fashion. Consistent with this conclusion, a deleted version of Nurr1 (Nurr1-(1–583)), lacking the carboxyl-terminal AF2 core, activated the NBRE reporter gene with diminished efficiency (Fig. 1 C). Additional experiments demonstrated that the residual activity (approximately 40–50% of wild type; Fig. 1 C) was mediated by the amino-terminal activation domain (data not shown). An alignment of the carboxyl-terminal AF2 core regions of RXRα, RARα, Nurr1, NGFI-B, and Nor1 is shown in Fig. 2 A. The hydrophobic amino acids (asterisks in Fig. 2 A) present in the AF2 core in the canonical NR structure are conserved in Nurr1, NGFI-B, and Nor1, indicating that this subgroup of receptors contains the corresponding amphipathic α-helical structure (45Wurtz J.-M. Bourquet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In contrast, the AF2 core regions in Nurr1, NGFI-B, and Nor1 contain a conserved lysine (boldface type in Fig. 2 A) at a position that in ligand-dependent receptors is a highly conserved glutamic acid. This glutamic acid is important for association with coactivators and transcriptional activation by several NRs (15Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G.

To more carefully analyze the structural requirements of the AF2 core region of Nurr1 for transactivation in 293 cells, we substituted each AF2 core amino acid with alanine in a series of mutated Nurr1 derivatives (Fig. 2 A). These mutations were introduced into full-length Nurr1 and into hybrid receptor derivatives containing the mutated carboxyl-terminal domains fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. As shown in Fig. 2 B, several of the residues are of importance for full activation by Nurr1. Notably, two mutations (D589A and F592A) reduced activation to the same extent as when the entire AF2 core is deleted (compare with Nurr1-(1–583)). Consistent with this result, analysis of Gal4 hybrid mutants demonstrated that alanine substitutions of Asp589 and Phe592resulted in almost complete abolishment of transactivation by the carboxyl-terminal domain (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, three of the Gal4 derivatives (I588A, L591A, and L593A) showed decreased but not completely abolished activity (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, two of the mutants (I587A and K590A) consistently showed a slightly increased activity both in the context of the full-length Nurr1 and in Gal4 fused receptor derivatives. Together these results define specific structural requirements of the Nurr1 AF2 core region and further emphasize its critical role for transcriptional activation in 293 cells. We next wished to analyze if the functional integrity of the AF2 core region is essential for ligand-induced activation by Nurr1-RXR heterodimers. When Nurr1 is expressed in, for example, JEG-3 or 293 cells, heterodimerization with endogenous RXR leads to efficient RXR ligand-dependent activation of reporter plasmids containing DR-5 response elements such as the retinoic acid response element, βRE (31Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent RXR activation is promoted equally well by wild-type Nurr1 as by all of the generated AF2 core mutants including D589A and F592A, which abolished AF2-dependent transactivation by Nurr1 monomers in 293 cells (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, a mutation introduced into the AF2 core of RXR diminished ligand-induced reporter gene activation of Nurr1-RXR heterodimers (data not shown). Thus, unlike several other heterodimers that require the intact AF2 core regions of both dimerization partners, a functionally intact Nurr1 AF2 core is not required for efficient activation by Nurr1-RXR heterodimers. Surprisingly, we found that the truncated Nurr1 derivative (Nurr1-(1–583)) lacking the AF2 core region showed diminished activation in parallel experiments (Fig. 3 B). As demonstrated by a gel shift analysis, GST-RXR pull-down of35S-labeled Nurr1 derivatives and a mammalian two-hybrid experiment using the truncated Gal4-Nurr1 derivative as a bait, dimerization between Nurr1 and RXR is abolished in the absence of the Nurr1 AF2 core region (Fig. 3, C and D, and data not shown). This indicates an unusual amino acid requirement for heterodimerization between Nurr1 and RXR compared with other RXR heterodimers. In contrast, the amino acid substitutions in the AF2 core mutants D589A and F592A, which perturbed constitutive Nurr1 transactivation, did not affect dimerization (Fig. 3 C). Since Nurr1 AF2 has a clear activation potential, we wished to analyze how co-expression of NR coactivators influence activation by Nurr1. SRC-1 has previously been shown to interact with several NRs (41Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). However, SRC-1 expression did not influence NBRE-specific reporter gene induction by Nurr1 in 293 cells, whereas activation by RXR of a βRE reporter gene in response to the RXR ligand SR11237 was significantly enhanced in the presence of SRC-1 (Fig. 4, A andB). In addition, a VP16 fused derivative of SRC-1 did not interact with Gal4-Nurr1 as revealed by a two-hybrid experiment, while efficient interaction with Gal4-RXR was detected in control experiments (Fig"

To identify proteins that participate in the cGMP/cGK signaling pathway, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system with cGK Iα as bait. cDNAs encoding slow skeletal troponin T (skTnT) were isolated from both mouse embryo and human skeletal muscle cDNA libraries. The skTnT protein interacted with cGK Iβ but not with cGK II nor cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays revealed that the N-terminal region of cGK Iα, containing the leucine zipper motif, is sufficient for the association with skTnT. In vivoanalysis, mutations in cGK Iα, which disrupted the leucine zipper motif, were shown to completely abolish the binding to skTnT. Furthermore, cGK I also interacted with cardiac TnT (cTnT) but not with cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Together with the observations that cTnI is a good substrate for cGK I and is effectively phosphorylated in the presence of cTnT in vitro, these findings suggest that TnT functions as an anchoring protein for cGK I and that cGK I may participate in the regulation of muscle contraction through phosphorylation of TnI. cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) is a major intracellular receptor of cGMP and is implicated in several signal transduction pathways.

The increase in intracellular cGMP levels is consistent with the increased stimulation of guanylate cyclases that are acceptors for nitric oxide (NO) and natriuretic peptides. However, the physiological effects of cGMP through the activation of cGKs have been little studied because the identification of the physiological significance of cGKs is further complicated by the existence of two forms of cGK, cGK I and cGK II, which are encoded by distinct genes, and of two different isoforms of cGK I (designated Iα and Iβ), produced by alternative splicing (8Wernet W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). cGK Iα and cGK Iβ were shown to be dimeric enzymes that contain several domains with well defined functions. The regulatory compartment located in the N-terminal region contains the leucine zipper motif and autoinhibitory domain, followed by two cGMP binding and catalytic domains. Within the protein kinase superfamily, cGK is most closely related to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK). cGK and cAK share similar structural properties (9Takio K. Wade R.D. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), showing that cGK and cAK have many similar and overlapping consensus phosphorylation motifs and that substrates identified for cGK are often efficiently phosphorylated by cAK in vitro. In addition to that cGKs are localized to few tissues relative to the ubiquitous cAKs, the relatively low cytosolic concentration of cGK in most cells (10Lincoln T.M. Hall C.L. Park C.R. Corbin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) suggests that mechanisms other than recognition of consensus phosphorylation motifs contribute to the selective cGMP-mediated protein phosphorylation in cells. Recent studies indicate that specific anchoring proteins located at various sites in the cell compartmentalize the kinase to sites of action and that the location of anchoring proteins provides some of the specificity of the responses mediated by each kinase (11Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 12Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Indeed, cAK binds to specific anchoring proteins, which are termed AKAPs (for A kinase anchoring proteins), through the regulatory subunits (13Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 14Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Hastings C.A.S. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24245-24251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of cAMP to cAK holoenzyme releases the catalytic subunits, enabling them to phosphorylate their substrates. Therefore, the localization of cAK near its substrates may ensure the rapid phosphorylation of specific substrates in response to increases in the intracellular concentration of cAMP. Other proteins reported to be localized in the cell with substrates include protein kinase C (PKC) (15Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and Raf (16Fu H. Xia K. Pallas D.C. Cui C. Conroy K. Narsimhan R.P. Mamon H. Collier R.J. Roberts T.M. Science. 1994; 266: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To assess the potential functions of cGK Is and to determine the mechanism by which these functions are carried out, we isolated components of the cGMP/cGK signaling pathway such as substrates and regulatory proteins of cGK using the yeast two-hybrid system. We report evidence that cGK Is directly interact with skeletal and cardiac troponin Ts (TnT) and phosphorylate cardiac troponin I (TnI) in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that the interaction of cGK I with TnT is important for regulating the muscle contraction through the phosphorylation of TnI.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out using random hexamers at 42 °C for 1 h according to the instructions provided with the GeneAmp RNA PCR Core kit (PE Biosystems). PCR amplification was carried out through 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. All PCR products were cloned into TA-cloning vector pGEM-T easy (Promega), and then the sequences of DNA fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In brief, the yeast strain CG1945 was cotransformed with pAS2–1 cGK Iα and the mouse 17-day embryo and human skeletal muscle cDNA libraries in pGAD10 using the lithium acetate method. Transformants were selected on synthetic dropout agar plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine but containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Yeast colonies were transferred onto a nylon membrane and processed by the β-galactosidase filter assay. Plasmid DNAs were isolated from positive colonies and re-transformed into the yeast strain Y190 with either pAS2–1 empty vector or pAS2–1 cGK Iα. The β-galactosidase assay was again conducted to ensure that the activity was cGK Iα-dependent. The cDNA inserts from true positive clones were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination methods using an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated sequencer and a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Biosystems). The glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression vector pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and GST fusion protein construct pGEX-cGK Iα-(1–66) carrying cDNA encoding the bovine cGK Iα-(1–66) were introduced into the bacterial strain JM109 cells (TOYOBO). An overnight culture in LB medium was diluted 1:100 into 100 ml of fresh LB and incubated at 37 °C in a shaking incubator for 2 h. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the whole was incubated for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed once with ice-cold soluble buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 and 1 mm EDTA) and resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold soluble buffer containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After freezing and thawing, suspended cells were sonicated on ice in short bursts. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were settled by centrifugation at 700 × g, washed five times with ice-cold soluble buffer, and incubated with 10 mm reduced glutathione for 10 min at 4 °C to elute the GST or GST-cGK Iα-(1–66) fusion protein from the beads. After centrifugation at 700 × g, the supernatant was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and used for in vitro binding analysis. Similarly, skeletal TnT (skTnT) was expressed as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fused protein inEscherichia coli and purified by maltose affinity chromatography (NEB). GST or GST-cGK Iα-(1–66) was incubated with MBP or MBP-skTnT immobilized on amylose resin in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After 1 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed five times with TNE buffer. The bound proteins were eluted from the resin with maltose in TNE buffer. For immunoblotting, the proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). GST-cGK Iα-(1–66) fusion protein was detected with goat anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After being blocked with Block Ace (Snow Brand Milk Products) overnight, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-GST antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Bound primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Jackson) and visualized by the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The full-length bovine cGK Iα or human cGK Iβ cDNA in the expression vector pFLAG-CMV-2 (Kodak) and the full-length mouse skeletal TnT or human cardiac TnT cDNA in pcDNA3.1/His C (Invitrogen) were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS regents according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after transfection and scraped in an ice-cold TNE buffer. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with either anti-Xpress polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen) or anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody (Kodak) with protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C by rotation. The beads were washed five times with TNE buffer, and immune complexes were eluted by heating at 95 °C in 2 × SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. For the analysis of cGK activity, the immunoprecipitated samples were used.

The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g and 4 °C. The beads were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and the denatured proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pFLAG-cGK Iα and pFLAG-cTnI as described above. For [32P]phosphate labeling, transiently transfected COS-7 cells were washed and preincubated with phosphate-free medium containing 1 mCi/ml [32P]phosphate (500 μCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products) for 3 h and either left untreated or treated with 8-CPT-cGMP (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells were scraped in an ice-cold cell extract buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 5 mmglycerophosphoric acid, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The cell extracts were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody with protein G-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C by rotation. The beads were washed twice with cell extract buffer, and immune complexes were eluted by heating at 95 °C in 2 × SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed at −80 °C. To determine the molecular mechanism of cGMP/cGK signaling, and identify proteins that interact with cGK, the yeast two-hybrid system was used. The full-length bovine cGK Iα was used as bait to screen mouse 17-day embryo and human skeletal muscle cDNA libraries. Of the 2 × 106 transformants from the mouse library screened, three colonies were positive for the β-galactosidase assay. Sequence analysis revealed that all of the isolated cDNAs encode mouse slow skTnT (24Jin J.-P. Chen A. Huang Q.-Q. Gene ( Amst. ). 1998; 214: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we isolated several independent cDNAs encoding human skTnT from the human skeletal muscle cDNA library as true positive clones. Experiments using the yeast two-hybrid system were conducted to confirm that the interaction of cGK Iα with skTnT is specific. As shown in Fig. 1, neither GAL4-BD alone nor the GAL4-BD p53 fusion protein interacted with skTnT. Only when the cGK Iα cDNA was co-transformed with skTnT cDNA was expression of the lacZ reporter gene observed. To identify the region of cGK Iα responsible for the interaction with skTnT, we constructed a series of cGK Iα deletion mutants and tested then for their ability to associate with skTnT in the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 2, we found that the cGK Iα domain required for interaction with skTnT is restricted to the N-terminal sequence between amino acids 1–66. Expression of the GAL4-BD cGK Iα deletion mutants in yeast was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis with an antibody against GAL4-BD (data not shown). Importantly, other cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, including cGK Iβ, cGK II, and cAK regulatory subunit IIα (cAK RIIα), are known to contain the dimerization domain and autoinhibitory region in their N terminus, respectively. To determine whether skTnT associates with these kinase isozymes, the full-length cGK Iβ, cGK II, cAK RIIα, and cAK catalytic subunit α (cAK Cα) were fused with GAL4-BD and co-transformed with skTnT. The yeast two-hybrid system demonstrated that only cGK Iβ can associate with skTnT (Fig. 3). To be sure that the interaction with skTnT is cGK I-specific, expression of the GAL4-BD cAK RIIα fusion protein in yeast was confirmed as demonstrated by the interaction of GAL4-BD cAK RIIα with GAL4-AD microtubular-associated protein 2 (25, 26; and data not shown). Expression of the other GAL4-BD fused proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis using anti-GAL4-BD antibody (data not shown). To test whether the interaction between cGK Iα and skTnT is direct or is mediated by a third unidentified yeast protein, we performed in vitro binding assay. Bovine cGK Iα-(1–66) and mouse full-length skTnT were expressed as a fusion protein with GST and MBP, respectively. GST-cGK Iα-(1–66) bound specifically to MBP-skTnT immobilized on amylose resin but not to MBP alone (Fig. 4). To confirm this interaction between cGK Iα and skTnT in intact cells, we co-expressed a FLAG-epitope-tagged cGK Iα with Xpress-epitope-tagged skTnT in COS-7 cells. The ability of an antibody against either the FLAG or Xpress-epitope to precipitate a complex of cGK Iα and skTnT suggests that these two proteins strongly interactin vivo (Fig. 5). When cGMP binds to cGMP-binding domains of cGK I, the kinase undergoes a conformational change which results in activation of its catalytic function (27Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Zhao J. Trewhella J. Corbin J. Francis S. Mitchell R. Brushia R. Walsh D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of the conformational change produced by cGMP on the interaction between cGK Iα and skTnT. The COS-7 cells, which were co-transfected with cGK Iα and skTnT, were treated with 8-bromo-cGMP, a cell-permeable analogue of cGMP. However, exposure of the cells to 8-bromo-cGMP caused no change in the amount of the cGK Iα-skTnT complex. The cGK Iα-(1–66) contains the leucine zipper, a sequence of heptad repeats of leucines and isoleucines forming an α-helical structure, identified as the domain responsible for the dimerization of cGK I. To define whether cGK Iα interacts with skTnT via the leucine zipper motif, we prepared a mutant (I19A/L40A) of cGK Iα in which both isoleucine 19 and leucine 40 are changed to alanines. As shown in Fig. 6, cGK Iα (I19A/L40A), which disrupted the leucine zipper motif, was shown to completely abolish the binding to skTnT. Identical results were obtained using the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown). These observations indicate that this leucine zipper motif in the N-terminal region of cGK I plays a critical role in the association with skTnT. Furthermore, to directly determine whether cGK activity is required for the interaction between cGK Iα and skTnT, a kinase-deficient version of cGK Iα, cGK Iα (D502A), in which aspartate 502 is changed to alanine (29Gudi T.

We demonstrate that incubation of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoid cells with an anti-CD40 antibody acting as an agonist results in the stimulation of a neutral sphingomyelinase, hydrolysis of cellular SM, and concomitant ceramide generation. In addition, SM degradation was observed in acid sphingomyelinase-deficient cells, as well as after ligation by soluble CD40 ligand. The anti-CD40 antibody, as well as the soluble CD40 ligand induced a decrease in thymidine incorporation and morphological features of apoptosis, which were mimicked by cell-permeant or bacterial sphingomyelinase-produced ceramides. Stable expression of a dominant-negative form of the FAN protein (factor associated with neutral sphingomyelinase activation), which has been reported to mediate tumor necrosis factor-induced activation of neutral sphingomyelinase, significantly inhibited CD40 ligand-induced sphingomyelinase stimulation and apoptosis of transformed human fibroblasts. Transformed fibroblasts from FAN knockout mice were also protected from CD40-mediated cell death. Finally, anti-CD40 antibodies were able to co-immunoprecipitate FAN in control fibroblasts but not in cells expressing the dominant-negative form of FAN, indicating interaction between CD40 and FAN. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that CD40 ligation can activate via FAN a neutral sphingomyelinase-mediated ceramide pathway that is involved in the cell growth inhibitory effects of CD40.

For instance, TNFα has been reported to activate an acid sphingomyelinase through proteins that bind the 55-kDa receptor death domain and a neutral sphingomyelinase through the adapter protein FAN (factor associated with neutral sphingomyelinase activation) that specifically binds to a distinct cytoplasmic domain of the TNF receptor called the neutral sphingomyelinase activation domain (24Kolesnick R.N.

Although activation of the former enzyme by TNFα has been associated with apoptotic signaling, stimulation of the latter via FAN has been linked to noncytotoxic effects of TNF (24Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SM-ceramide signal transduction pathway has been shown to be activated by triggering of three members of the TNF receptor superfamily, i.e. the TNF receptor 1 (28Kim M.-Y.

Because CD40 belongs to this family, sharing some homology both in the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions with the above-mentioned receptors, because of the recruitment of common TRAF molecules, and because of the activation of intracellular targets also described to be stimulated by ceramide, we examined whether CD40 is able to activate the SM-ceramide pathway. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of CD40 engagement on SM and ceramide levels in EBV-transformed lymphoid B cells or in transformed fibroblasts. Evidence is presented for the first time that in these cells triggering of CD40 results in early neutral sphingomyelinase activation, SM hydrolysis, and ceramide generation and that these events, which precede apoptosis, are regulated, at least partially, by interaction with the FAN adapter protein. Monoclonal mouse anti-human CD40 (IgG1, clone M3) and anti-human CD40L were purchased from Genzyme (Cergy, France), rabbit anti-human CD40 (clone C-20) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and murine anti-CD40 (clone 1C10) was from R & D Systems (Abingdon, United Kingdom); human IgG1 isotype control was from Sigma. Rabbit anti-human TNFR1 (clone H-271) was purchased from Santa Cruz, and anti-human α-actin was from Sigma. Soluble trimeric human CD40L/leucine zipper fusion protein was a gift of Immunex (Seattle, WA). [methyl- 3H]Choline chloride (81 Ci/mmol), [methyl- 3H]thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol), and [choline-methyl- 14C]SM (54 mCi/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products, and [γ-32P]ATP (3500 Ci/mmol) from ICN (Orsay, France). Sphingomyelinase (Bacillus cereus), bovine brain type III ceramide, N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), N-hexanoyl-sphingosine (C6-ceramide), and ExtrAvidin-peroxidase were supplied from Sigma; phospholipase C (B. cereus, grade I), biotin-16-dUTP and terminal transferase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.d,l-threo-1-Phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol was from Alexis-Coger (Paris, France). All solvents and other reagents obtained from Merck or SDS (Peypin, France) were of analytical grade. Long-term lymphoid cell lines were established by EBV transformation of human peripheral blood B lymphocytes as reported (36Levade T. Gatt S. Maret A. Salvayre R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13519-13529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Line Tre was derived from a patient affected with Niemann-Pick disease Type A. More than 90% of the lymphoid cells were positive for CD40 as determined by flow cytometry. Cells were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with Glutamax (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy, France), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Boehringer Ingelheim, Gagny, France). Human SV40-transformed skin fibroblasts were derived from a normal individual (line Mav) or from a patient affected with Niemann-Pick disease Type A (line Ber). These cells were routinely grown in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Glutamax (2 mmol/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (10%) as previously reported (37Chatelut M.

The normal fibroblast cell line was transfected by electroporation (960 μF, 250 V) with the empty pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands), or with pcDNA3 carrying the full-length (encoding amino acids 3–917) or a truncated version (encoding amino acids 703–917) of the FAN cDNA (27Adam-Klages S.

For SM quantitation, lymphoid cells and transformed fibroblasts were incubated in their respective medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and [methyl-3H]choline (0.7 μCi/ml). After 48–72 h incubation, cells were chased for 2 h in fresh medium. Then, cells (5 × 106/ml) were incubated at 37 °C with or without 1–5 μg/ml of anti-CD40, control IgG, or 1–3 μg/ml of soluble CD40L. At the indicated times, cells were collected and sedimented at 4 °C by low-speed centrifugation, and cell pellets were immediately frozen at −20 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in 0.6 ml of distilled water, and cells were disrupted at 4 °C by brief sonication. Lipids were extracted, and [3H]choline-labeled SM was quantified as previously reported (31Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cellular SM levels were quantified by measuring the lipid phosphorus content (39Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). Ceramide mass was measured essentially as described (40van Veldhoven P. Matthews T. Bolognesi D. Bell R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), using recombinant Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase (Calbiochem, Meudon, France) and [γ-32P]ATP. Radioactive ceramide-1-phosphate was isolated by TLC using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:20:15:10:5, by volume) as developing solvent. Cellular sphingomyelinase activities were assayed as described previously (41Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 42Levade T. Salvayre R. Lenoir G. Douste-Blazy L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 793: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using [choline-methyl- 14C]SM (100,000 dpm/assay) as substrate. Lymphoid cells were suspended in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and distributed in 24-well flat-bottomed plates (250 000 cells/well). Cells were treated with the indicated stimuli (exogenous ceramides were delivered as ethanolic solutions) and further incubated at 37 °C for 24, 48, or 72 h. [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was added to the cells during the last 16 h of incubation, and incorporation into DNA was measured as reported (31Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fibroblast viability was estimated directly on six-well culture plates by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay or by coincubation with propidium iodide (4 μm) and Syto-13 (1 μm) (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). The percentage of apoptotic cells (having a condensed and fragmented nucleus), including postapoptotic cells (characterized by nuclear fragmentation, cell condensation, and propidium iodide staining), was evaluated by counting cells (100 cells in at least three different fields for each well) under a Leica fluorescence-equipped inverted microscope. Cells were also examined under the light microscope after fixation with 4% formaldehyde and May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining. DNA fragmentation was assessed in situ by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling procedure of Gavrieli et al. (43Gravrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9133) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treating the formaldehyde-fixed cells with terminal transferase and biotinylated dUTP, they were covered with ExtrAvidin-peroxidase and stained with diaminobenzidine. For ultrastructural analysis, cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon before staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were examined under a Hitachi 300 transmission electron microscope. To measure annexin V binding, cells (5 × 106/ml) were sedimented, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.8 mm CaCl2. These were then incubated at 4 °C for 15 min in the presence of 1 μg/ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (Bender Medsystems, Vienna, Austria) and 10 μg/ml of propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACScan). Total cellular RNA was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate-derived method RNABle (Eurobio, les Ulis, France), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was subjected to 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde, and transferred to Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out using anEcoRI/NotI digest of the truncated FAN cDNA as a probe, which was radiolabeled by random priming with α-[32P]dCTP using the Oligolabeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA was also probed with a similarly labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe. The membrane then was exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. Cells were washed and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaVO4, and 5 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, for 30 min on ice. Equal amounts of proteins were separated in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were detected using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). FAN was detected using a rabbit antibody (obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). CD40 and TNFR1 were immunoprecipitated by incubating cell lysates (about 1.5 mg of protein) with the corresponding antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were recovered on protein G- or protein A-Sepharose, eluted, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as indicated above. Engagement of CD40 on EBV-transformed lymphoid cells was studied by using either a monoclonal anti-human CD40 antibody (acting as an agonist) or a soluble recombinant CD40L. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, CD40 ligation on [3H]choline-labeled lymphoid cells (but not an irrelevant IgG) induced a time-dependent SM hydrolysis, which was detectable after 5 min and represented about 20% of total cellular SM. The SM levels then returned to baseline values by 90–120 min. Similar results were obtained when the SM levels were monitored by a mass quantitative assay (see Fig. 4) or after metabolic labeling with32P-orthophosphate (data not shown).FIG. 4Activation of SM hydrolysis and growth inhibition by CD40 ligation in Niemann-Pick cells. Lymphoid cells (5 × 106/ml) from a control subject or a patient affected with Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) were incubated in the absence or presence of 5 μg/ml of anti-CD40 mAb (αCD40) or isotype-matched murine (IgG1 m) antibody (A and B). A, intracellular SM levels were determined after 30 min incubation by mass assay (mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments). B,[3H]thymidine incorporation after 72 h of incubation. Results are expressed as percentage of the values in untreated cells; the data correspond to the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. C, induction of apoptosis by CD40 ligation in SV40-transformed skin fibroblasts. Fibroblasts derived from a normal individual and from a patient with Niemann-Pick disease Type A were treated for 24 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml of cycloheximide and 5 μg/ml of soluble CD40L. Apoptotic cells were counted using Syto13/propidium iodide staining (mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The degradation of SM in the SM signaling pathway has been shown to be mediated by the stimulation of a sphingomyelinase, which hydrolyzes SM to ceramide and phosphocholine (20Hannun Y.A.

Because different sphingomyelinases have been reported to be activated in this signal transduction pathway, we characterized the sphingomyelinase involved in CD40 signaling. Fig. 1 C shows that CD40 stimulated the activity of a neutral sphingomyelinase. This activation was detectable as early as 2 min and peaked at about 30 min. There was no detectable activation of an acidic sphingomyelinase (Fig. 1 C). Activation of SM breakdown in the SM signaling pathway should be accompanied by an increase in cellular ceramide levels. As illustrated in Fig. 1 D, CD40 triggering by anti-CD40 induced a significant elevation of ceramide levels. This increase was apparent by 5 min and maximal at 30–60 min, i.e. concomitantly to the peak of SM hydrolysis (see Fig. 1 A). Previous studies have demonstrated that CD40 stimulation inhibits either in vitro or in vivothe growth of human or murine B-cell lymphoma (6Heath A.W. Chang R. Harada N. Santos-Argumedo L. Gordon J.

It was of interest to examine the effect of CD40 ligation on the EBV-transformed lymphoid cells we used. As shown in Fig. 2, addition of the anti-CD40 antibody to lymphoid cells (but not an irrelevant IgG) resulted in growth inhibition (20% growth inhibitory effect after 72 h incubation), as determined either by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2, A and D) or cell counting (Fig. 2 C). Very similar results were obtained using 1–5 μg/ml soluble CD40L (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of cells with cell-permeant analogs of ceramide or indirect manipulation of endogenous ceramide levels have been shown to mimic the biological effects of inducers of the SM pathway (20Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). To determine whether the SM-ceramide pathway could mediate the observed growth inhibitory effect of CD40, we tested the effects of exogenous or endogenous ceramide. Treatment of lymphoid cells with exogenous sphingomyelinase (which hydrolyzed at least 20% of SM; Fig. 2,B and E), with low concentrations of cell-permeant C2-ceramide (data not shown) or C6-ceramide (Fig. 2, C and F), or even with bovine brain ceramide (Fig. 2 B) resulted in about 20–40% decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation, with kinetics close to that observed with anti-CD40. A similar effect was also obtained withd,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (Fig. 2 B), which inhibits the utilization of ceramide for glucosylceramide biosynthesis (45Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 565-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, incubation of the cells with bacterial phospholipase C, which degraded 20–30% cellular phosphatidyl-choline to diacylglycerol, and which, as sphingomyelinase, liberates phosphocholine, was devoid of any growth inhibitory effect (Fig. 2 B).

Neutral sphingomyelinase from human urine and cultured human kidney proximal tubular cell membranes has an apparent molecular mass of 92 kDa and neutral pH optima and is heat-unstable.

In cultured mammalian cells, the addition of diverse agonists,i.e. vitamin D3, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),1 interferon-γ, and nerve growth factor, results in the activation of N-SMase and the consequent production of ceramide. Ceramide and its higher homologs have been shown to serve as lipid second messengers that lead to diverse cell regulatory phenomena, such as differentiation, proliferation, and programmed cell death or apoptosis (1Chatterjee S.

Activation of N-SMase by TNF-α in human skin fibroblasts results in not only the hydrolytic cleavage of sphingomyelin, residing on the cell surface, but also the mobilization of cholesterol to the interior of the cell. Such cholesterol is esterified by the action of fatty-acyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase to form cholesteryl esters (1Chatterjee S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 25-48PubMed Google Scholar,7Chatterjee S. J.

In a human hepatocyte cell line, TNF-α-induced N-SMase activation and ceramide production led to the maturation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and a subsequent increase in LDL receptor mRNA expression (8Lawler Jr., J.F.

Interestingly, this phenomenon is not accompanied by apoptosis and occurs in a sterol-independent fashion. Thus, LDL receptors may be up-regulated via this cascade of reactions involving N-SMase independent of the presence of sterols in the culture medium. These studies suggest that N-SMase may be involved in the regulation of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and sterol influx (7Chatterjee S. J. Biol.

These are the classical 92-kDa Mg2+-dependent N-SMase and a Mg2+-independent 53-kDa protein. The localization of N-SMase in skeletal muscle transferase tubule membrane is in agreement with the production of the sphingomyelin-derived second messenger, sphingosine, in such tubules. Since sphingosine has been shown to modulate calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, these studies imply that N-SMase/sphingosine signaling systems may be a physiologically relevant mechanism of regulation of Ca2+ levels in skeletal muscle and may well be involved in muscle contraction (9Ghosh N. Sabbadini R. Chatterjee S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 189: 161-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In additional studies, we have shown that Sindbis virus entry into cells triggers apoptosis by activating sphingomyelinase and the release of ceramide. 2J. T. Jan, S. Chatterjee, and D. F. Griffin, submitted for publication. Collectively, these studies imply that N-SMase may play a central role in diverse cell regulatory phenomena. Nevertheless, the evidence accumulated so far in support of this view has been largely indirect and has recently been the subject of rigorous debate (11Hofman K. Dixit V.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 227-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), particularly in regard to the controversial role of ceramide in apoptosis (12Kolesick R. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 224-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We rationalized that to unambiguously demonstrate the functional role of N-SMase in the various cell regulatory phenomena discussed above, it was essential to first clone this protein. Therefore, we employed a monospecific polyclonal antibody against human N-SMase and a human kidney cDNA library to pursue expression cloning. In this work, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of recombinant N-SMase (r-N-SMase) expressed in Escherichia coli as well as in cultured COS-7 cells. In work to be published elsewhere, we will show that overexpression of N-SMase results in spontaneous apoptosis in human aortic smooth muscle cells independent of the presence of agonists. 3S.

[α-32P]dATP (specific activity of 0.25 Bq/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity of 9.25 Bq/mmol), andN-methyl[14C]sphingomyelin (specific activity of 1.85 Bq/mmol were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. E. coli strain 1090r was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. COS-7 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, Utah), penicillin, streptomycin, and nonessential amino acids. The multiple tissue Northern blot and human kidney library were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The transient expression vector pSV-SPOT-1, LipofectAMINETM, and cell culture medium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Bacterial cells and COS-7 cells transfected with N-SMase cDNA were homogenized in Tris/glycine buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% cutscum. The samples were mixed vigorously and sonicated for 10 s. Next, the samples were transferred to a 4 °C incubator and shaken for ∼2 h. Every hour, the samples were sonicated again on ice and further shaken. Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected, and the protein content was measured using bovine serum albumin as a standard and subjected to N-SMase assay using [14C]sphingomyelin as a substrate (2Chatterjee S. Ghosh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12554-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transfected with pSV-SPOT-1 and pHH1 were subjected to detergent extraction as described above. The supernatants were subjected to sodium lauryl sarcosine-polyacrylamide (7.5%) gel electrophoresis at 4 °C as described previously (13Taki T. Chatterjee S. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The gel was calibrated with prestained proteins of known molecular mass (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, the gel was sliced, and pieces were transferred to a glass test tube and subjected to N-SMase assay at pH 7.4 using [14C]sphingomyelin as a substrate. The human kidney library was screened using the anti-N-SMase antibody available in our laboratory according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, λgt11 phage was plated at 3 × 104 plaque-forming units/150-mm plate on a lawn ofE. coli strain y1090r. Incubation was carried out at 42 °C for 3.5 h to allow lytic phage growth. Then, a filter saturated with 10 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was placed on top of the plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Next, the filter was blocked with a solution of 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the filter was incubated with antibody against N-SMase at 1:200 dilution at room temperature overnight, and signal was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sixty-three clones were obtained by screening 1 × 106 λgt11 phage clones. The most intense clones of cells were subjected to secondary and tertiary screening. All positive clones were subjected to PCR to identify their insert size. Finally, a clone containing the longest insert called λ32-1 was used for further analysis by subcloning, sequencing, and expression. We followed the protocol as described by the manufacturer. In this experiment, the host growing in the logarithmic phase was infected with phage and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. Next, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (10 mm) was added, and incubation was continued at 37 °C. The cell cultures were removed at 0, 15, 30, and 45 min and 1, 2, 4, and 24 h. The cells were centrifuged, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored frozen for further biochemical experimentation. To prepare GST-N-SMase fusion protein, a pJK2 expression plasmid, pBC32-2, was digested with BssHII and EcoRI. A 2793-bp insert representing the N-SMase open reading frame that is missing 18 bp of N-terminal sequence was ligated with a phosphorylatedBamHI-BssHII linker containing 18 bp of N-terminal sequence (synthesized at the Core facility at The Johns Hopkins University) and a pGEX4T-1 vector double-digested withBamHI and EcoRI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To express and purify GST-N-SMase fusion protein, plasmid pJK2 was transformed into E. coli HB101 cells. A single colony of HB101[pJK2] was grown in 2× yeast extract/tryptone agarose medium at 30 °C until appropriate cell density (A 600 = 1.5) was achieved. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 m) was added to induce fusion protein expression for 2 h. Cells were harvested, and the fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). N-SMase was released from the fusion protein by thrombin digestion. Such preparations were subjected to activity measurements and Western immunoblot assays. To put N-SMase cDNA into a transient expression vector, pBC32-2 was double-digested with restriction endonucleases NotI andSalI. The 3.6-kb insert containing N-SMase was gel-purified and inserted into the transient expression vector pSV-SPOT-1. A plasmid called pHH1 was thus constructed. To transfect COS-7 cells with pHH1 and mock vector, we seeded 3 × 105 COS-7 cells/plate in a p100 plate in 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated in a 10% CO2 37 °C incubator until they were 80% confluent. The cells were then transfected with 1.0 μg/ml purified pHH1 using LipofectAMINETM in medium. The medium was changed after overnight incubation. Finally, the cells were harvested at various time points (16, 24, 36, and 48 h post-transfection) by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored frozen at −20 °C. r-N-SMase derived from COS-7 cells was purified as described previously (2Chatterjee S. Ghosh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12554-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was employed for detailed characterization studies with regard to pH optima, substrate specificity, requirement for metal ions for activation, and other previously described agonists/antagonists of N-SMase as well as immunoprecipitation with anti-N-SMase antibody and preimmune rabbit serum IgG. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western immunoblot assays, and the activity of N-SMase was measured in the supernatants. We selected one set of sequence primers from pBC32-2 (T3-2/4T3R5) as the reverse transcription-PCR primer to carry out reverse transcription-PCR as described above. A 465-bp specific product was obtained and gel-purified; 50 ng of this product was labeled with 25 μCi of [α-32P]dATP and 25 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP using random hexamer primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). The specific activity of this probe was 1.88 × 109 cpm/μg. Next, the multiple tissue Northern blot was prehybridized in 7 ml of hybridization-prehybridization solution at 42 °C for 5 h with continuous agitation. Then, 10 μg of fresh denatured salmon sperm was added. Next, 10 ml of hybridization solution was added and agitated continuously at 50 °C. The blots were washed twice in 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 30–40 min and then in 0.1× SSC and 0.05% SDS for 40 min at 50 °C. Finally, the blot was exposed overnight to a x-ray film at −70 °C using two intensifying screens. A plasmid containing a β-actin insert was used as a control in these experiments. Our strategy for the molecular cloning of cDNA for N-SMase involved the use of monospecific antibodies against human urinary N-SMase (2Chatterjee S. Ghosh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12554-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This rationale stemmed from our previous findings: (i) in human leukemic cells (HL-60), TNF-α-induced activation of N-SMase was abrogated by such antibodies; (ii) in HL-60 cells and aortic smooth muscle cells, TNF-α- and oxidized LDL-induced apoptosis, respectively, was abrogated by anti-N-SMase antibody; and (iii) both TNF-α-induced maturation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 in human liver cells and TNF-α-induced cholesteryl ester synthesis in human skin fibroblasts were abrogated by preincubation of cells with such antibodies (7Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 879-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used this antibody to screen the human kidney λgt11 cDNA library. Sixty-three positive clones were obtained by screening 1 × 106 clones. The most intense clones were subjected to secondary and tertiary screening. All positive clones were subjected to PCR to identify their insert size. Finally, a clone containing the longest insert (3.7 kb) called λ32-1 was subjected to subcloning into pBluescript II SK to prepare plasmid pBC32-2. The insert was sequenced with Sequenase using T7 and T3 primers by automatic sequencing. The 3.7-kb nucleotide sequence of cDNA revealed an open reading frame size of 1197 base pairs, which predicts a 397-amino acid polypeptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of N-SMase is shown in Fig. 1. There are several potential modification sites in this protein. OneN-glycosylation site at position 353, one tyrosine phosphorylation site at position 238, and two cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites at positions 218 and 357 were found. This protein also has four casein kinase II phosphorylation sites at positions 3, 33, 65, and 101; five myristoylation sites at positions 28, 44, 205, 206, and 220 were found. There are 10 protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at positions 38, 48, 164, 216, 217, 236, 251, 260, 323, and 355 (Fig. 1). Hydropathy plot analysis of N-SMase indicated that there are a few hydrophobic stretches, i.e. residues 75–100, indicating the presence of a transmembrane domain. The N-glycosylation site at position 353, the tyrosine phosphorylation site at position 238, and several other phosphorylation sites are presumably located on the exterior. Such sites may be subject to further glycosylation and phosphorylation. The alignment of the death domain of N-SMase with the death domains of TNF-α 55-kDa receptor-1 (TNF-α-R1) and Fas/Apo-I is shown in Fig. 2. N-SMase shows closer homology to the TNF-α-R1 death domain (∼25%) than to the Fas/Apo-I (∼19%) death domain (14Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, N-SMase and TNF-α-R1 have complete conservation of the ATL peptide at the C terminus of the death domain. Moreover, we found that over a 52-amino acid overlap, N-SMase had 26.9% identity and 71% similarity to acid sphingomyelinase (15Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Since there is no cysteine residue in our deduced amino acid sequence, this may suggest multiple post-translational modifications of N-SMase. To assess this hypothesis, we expressed N-SMase in both E. coli and COS-7 cells. To confirm that the cDNA does encode N-SMase with an apparent molecular mass of 45.4 kDa, we made constructs of the cDNA-coding region fused with glutathione S-transferase. We then transfected this plasmid into E. coli HB101 to express and to purify GST-N-SMase fusion protein. The expression of the fusion protein was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1m) for 2 h. The crude fusion protein (Fig. 3, lane 2) was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography. After N-SMase was released from the fusion protein by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography, it resolved as a single band with a molecular mass of 46 kDa (Fig. 3,lane 3), and the estimated pI is 4.93. The urinary N-SMase reported by us previously has an apparent molecular mass of ∼92 kDa and a pI of ∼6.55 (2Chatterjee S. Ghosh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12554-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference may be due to multiple post-transcriptional modifications of the mammalian N-SMase compared with the bacterial N-SMase (see below). The bacterial N-SMase was recognized by antibody against human N-SMase (Fig. 3, lane 4). Affinity-purified r-N-SMase expressed in E. colihad an activity of 3.9 μmol/mg of protein/h. The deduced amino acid sequence of N-SMase indicates the lack of cysteine residues. To further confirm the cDNA encoding N-SMase, we inserted it into a mammalian cell transient expression vector and transfected it into COS-7 cells. Fig. 4 A shows that cells transfected with N-SMase cDNA (pHH1) exhibited a 10-fold increase in N-SMase activity compared with cells transfected with mock vector (pSV-SPOT-1) 24 h post-transfection. Measurement of N-SMase activity following sodium lauryl sarcosine gel electrophoretic separation of r-N-SMase showed optimal activity corresponding to an ∼90–100-kDa protein (Fig. 4 B). This observation was confirmed further by Western immunoblot assay of r-N-SMase, which revealed that the apparent molecular mass of r-N-SMase is ∼90 kDa, and this was similar to the native N-SMase derived from human urine (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 A, r-N-SMase derived from cells overexpressing the enzyme had a pH optimum of ∼7.4. r-N-SMase did not have substantial enzyme activity in the acidic or alkaline range. Substrate specificity studies revealed that, of several phospholipids investigated, sphingomyelin appeared to be the most preferred substrate (data not shown). Studies on metal ion requirement revealed that r-N-SMase was activable with Mg2+ (2.5 mm) (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, Cu2+ (5 μm) markedly inhibited the activity of the enzyme. Additional studies revealed that r-N-SMase was insensitive to pretreatment with dithiothreitol, but the activity was inhibited significantly by glutathione (2.5 mm) (Fig. 5 B). Additional characterization studies using antibody against N-SMase and rabbit preimmune serum IgG as a control revealed the following. When the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western immunoblot assays, an anti-N-SMase antibody concentration-dependent increase in the mass of N-SMase protein was revealed (Fig. 6 A). On the other hand, measurement of N-SMase activity in the supernatants obtained following immunoprecipitation with anti-N-SMase antibody revealed a progressive decrease (Fig. 6 B). Collectively, these data indicate that anti-N-SMase antibody could quantitatively immunoprecipitate r-N-SMase. In contrast, preimmune serum IgG did not immunoprecipitate the Mg2+-dependent N-SMase activity, and most of the N-SMase activity was associated with the supernatant. The 465-bp reverse transcription-PCR fragment amplified at the 5′-end of the N-SMase cDNA-coding region was used to probe N-SMase mRNA in various human tissues. N-SMase was expressed in all the human tissues investigated; the transcript size and copy numbers varied from one tissue to another (Fig. 7). For example, the size of N-SMase transcripts in human pancreas, liver, lung, and placenta ranged from 2.4 to 9.5 kb in an ascending order. However, Northern blot analysis revealed that the major transcript size of N-SMase expressed in all of the eight human tissues investigated is 1.7 kb. The 1.7-kb transcript may be derived either from different genes or from alternative splicing. A β-actin Northern blot shown at the bottom of Fig. 7 was run to serve as a positive control. Using a human N-SMase monospecific polyclonal antibody, we have screened a human kidney cDNA library and have identified a 3.7-kb cDNA transcript. The open reading frame of the cDNA predicts a 397-amino acid polypeptide. When expressed in E. coli, it encodes a protein of ∼45 kDa based upon SDS gel electrophoretic analysis. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the cDNA conferred to r-N-SMase a 10-fold higher activity relative to mock cDNA-transfected cells and had an apparent molecular mass of ∼90 kDa, suggesting multiple post-transcriptional modifications. The presence of numerous phosphorylation sites via the action of protein kinase C, casein kinase II, cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, and tyrosine kinase is predictive of the sensitivity of this enzyme to inhibitors of protein kinase C and serine, tyrosine, and casein II kinases (4Lui B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 311-322Google Scholar, 16Mansat V. Beltaieb A. Levade T. Laurent G. Jaffrezou J.P. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Chimua S.J. Nodzenski E. Weichsalbaum Q.R. Quintase J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2711-2714PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of N-SMase indicates the lack of cysteine residues. This may explain its insensitivity to reducing agents, i.e. dithiothreitol (Fig. 5 B) and β-mercaptoethanol (18Chatterjee S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Lui B. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of enzyme activity by glutathione is consistent with previous studies implicating a potential regulatory mechanism for this enzyme (19Lui B. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Physical-chemical characterization of r-N-SMase revealed properties similar to those of the human urinary/kidney N-SMase described by us previously (1Chatterjee S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 25-48PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chatterjee S. Ghosh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12554-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chatterjee S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These were a pH optimum of 7.4, requirement for Mg2+, heat stability (control activity of 3223 cpm/h; activity after heat treatment at 60 °C for 30 min of 330 cpm/h), and detergent for activation and inhibition by Cu2+. The amino acid sequence and hydropathy curve analysis collectively suggest this enzyme to be a membrane-bound Mg2+-sensitive N-SMase. Collectively, the physical-chemical properties of r-N-SMase derived from COS-7 cells, including molecular mass, are identical to those of the native enzyme derived from human urine (2Chatterjee S. Ghosh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12554-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although nucleotide sequence alignment of N-SMase revealed some similarity to acid SMase (15Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was insensitive to treatment with 5′-adenosine monophosphate (data not shown), a compound that has been shown to inhibit acid SMase activity (2Chatterjee S. Ghosh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12554-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although r-N-SMase was recognized (immunoprecipitated) by antibody against N-SMase, but not by preimmune serum IgG, the activity of the enzyme in the immunoprecipitate could not be recovered. Similar observations have been made previously using β-galactosidase and the corresponding antibody. 4D. Usher, personal communication. This may be explained on the basis that the polyclonal antibody bound to the active site in N-SMase, rendering it inactive. Application of conditions or procedures such as high salt concentration (4 m KCl), heating, and lowering the pH to 4 to dissociate the enzyme from the immunoprecipitate did not facilitate the recovery of activity, as the enzyme itself was highly sensitive to such treatments. Nevertheless, we demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in the immunoprecipitation of the antigen by anti-N-SMase antibody and a decrease in the activity of N-SMase in the supernatant. In the future, the availability of a monoclonal antibody directed against N-SMase (exclusive of the active site) to immunoprecipitate the enzyme may help retain the activity of the enzyme. The physiological effects of r-N-SMase (data not shown) were also similar to those of human urinary/kidney N-SMase, such as a dose-dependent increase in cholesteryl ester synthesis and stimulation of the maturation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and LDL receptor mRNA expression in a continuous line of human hepatocytes (8Lawler Jr., J.F. Yin M. Diehl A.M. Roberts E. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5053-5059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of r-N-SMase in human aortic smooth muscle cells resulted in apoptosis and augmented oxidized LDL-induced apoptosis in these cells, 3S. Chatterjee, K. Gakenheimer, H. Han, S. Dey, G. Hutchins, I. Dobromilskaya, and A. Snowden, submitted for publication. and antibody against N-SMase abrogated this phenomenon. 5H. Han, T. C. Wan, and S. Chatterjee, submitted for publication. The cytoplasmic domain of two cell-surface receptors (Fas/Apo-I/CD95 and TNF-α-R) that share significant homology has been termed the “death domain.” These two proteins contain cysteine-rich repeats that are also found in the nerve growth factor family of proteins such as TNF-α-R2, CD30, CD26, CD40, Ox-4, and H-1BB. The ligands for Fas and TNF-α-R are FasL and TNF-α, respectively, and they can induce apoptosis in certain target cells (22Nagata S. Goldstein P. Science. 1993; 267: 1449-1456Crossref Scopus (3980) Google Scholar, 23Wiley S.R. Schooley U. Smolek P.J. Dim W.S. Huang C.P. Nickoll J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C. Smith C.S. Goodman R.G. Immunity. 1995; 3: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2664) Google Scholar). The death domains of TNF-α-R and Fas have been found to interact with several interactive and adaptive proteins that have homology to the death domain and that provide a link to caspase activation and apoptosis (14Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that overexpression of Fas/Apo-I or TNF-α-R1 can lead to apoptosis in the absence of ligands due to multi-oligomerization of the death domain (10Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camouis J.H. Walleck D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was not surprising to find spontaneous apoptosis in cells overexpressing N-SMase5 that was ligand-independent. This tenet is further supported by the alignment of the death domain of N-SMase with the death domains of Fas/Apo-I and TNF-α-R1, which showed close homology (Fig. 2). Indeed, N-SMase and TNF-α-R1 have complete conservation of the ATL peptide at the C terminus of the death domain. Further studies will be necessary to explain the relevance of these preliminary observations. Our cDNA consists of 3670 bp and contains polyadenylation signals at positions 351 (ATTATT), 805 (ATTAAA), 2562 (AATTAA), and 2835 (ATTAAA). These polyadenylation signals vary from the AATAAA consensus sequence, but they were found in 12% (ATTAAA) and 2% (AATTAA and ATTATT) of the mRNAs in vertebrates. Such smaller transcripts exist due to their termination at different locations. RNAs derived from placenta, lung, liver, and pancreas showed strong signals (Fig. 7). Kidney, brain, and heart RNAs showed medium level signals, and skeletal muscle RNA showed the weakest signal. There is apparently no correlation between N-SMase activity and N-SMase mRNA levels in a given tissue. For example, among ∼40 human tissues surveyed, brain had the highest enzyme activity for N-SMase. Skeletal muscle and kidney had 3- and 10-fold lower N-SMase activities, respectively, as compared with brain, yet the N-SMase mRNA levels in brain and kidney are similar. This may be due to tissue-specific translational regulation at multiple sites (Fig. 1). While this manuscript was in preparation, another publication appeared in the literature claiming the cloning of a mammalian neutral sphingomyelinase (20Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) using distal sequence homology with a bacterial sphingomyelinase. The role of this N-SMase in sphingolipid signaling was also assessed. Upon comparison, we noted several physical, chemical, and functional differences between the two cloned neutral sphingomyelinases. First, there is no amino acid sequence homology between the two N-SMases. Second, our N-SMase has multiple sites for protein post-transcriptional modification, and its physical-chemical characteristics are different. Third, overexpression of our N-SMase in human aortic smooth muscle cells stimulated apoptosis without the presence of an agonist such as oxidized LDL. However, oxidized LDL had an additive effect on apoptosis in cells overexpressing N-SMase. In comparison, the overexpression of N-SMase in HEK and U937 cells did not induce apoptosis independent of the presence and/or absence of TNF-α (20Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). There may be several reasons for the discrepancies in these two studies. One may be related to strategies used in the molecular cloning of these enzymes. It is quite likely that spontaneous apoptosis observed in cells overexpressing N-SMase in our study could be due to the presence of novel death domains absent in other reported N-SMases (20Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, given the complexity of the N-SMase molecule and its vital role in regulating diverse cell signaling pathways, we are not surprised to find different molecular isoforms of N-SMase (a). We predict that, in the future, many additional novel N-SMases will be found that will cleave sphingomyelin but may have diverse biological functions relevant to human health and disease. If so, then such proteins may represent ortholog products of the superfamily of N-SMase genes. Orthologs are defined as genes evolving from a common ancestral gene showing common function (21Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Science. 1995; 278 (Lipman, D. (1997)): 631-637Crossref Scopus (2772) Google Scholar).

The constructs were stably expressed in baby hamster kidney cells and purified, and binding affinities were determined for insulin, IGFI, and a single chain insulin/IGFI hybrid. The C-terminal domain of IRRR was found to abolish binding in IR and IGFIR context, whereas other constructs bound ligands. The two constructs with first three domains of the IR demonstrated low specificity for ligands, all affinities ranging from 3.0 to 15 nm. In contrast, the constructs with the first three domains of the IGFIR had high specificity, the affinity of the novel minimized IGFIR for IGFI was 1.5 nm,whereas the affinity for insulin was more than 3000 nm. When swapping the C-terminal domains in either receptor context only minor changes were observed in affinities (<3-fold), demonstrating that the carboxyl-terminal of IR and IGFIR α-subunits are interchangeable and suggesting that this domain is part of the common binding site.

The insulin receptor and IGFI receptors are membrane-bound glycoproteins with intracellular ligand stimulated tyrosine kinase domains, and they display similar overall structural organization (1Ullrich A.

A third member of this receptor family, the insulin receptor related receptor (IRRR) was identified at the genomic level by Shier and Watt in 1989 (4Shier P. Watt V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14605-14608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but so far no ligand for this receptor has been identified. The amino acid sequences of these receptors are approximately 50% identical (1Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.C. Tsubokawa M. Mason A.

The structure of the insulin receptor has been investigated extensively and reviewed (5Lee J. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C319-C334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tavaré J.M. Siddle K.

Predictions of the tertiary structure of the IR ectodomain based on alignment with epidermal growth factor receptor sequences (9Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T.

Genet. 1995; 22: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) produced the consensus that the first 468 amino acids of IR α-subunit comprise two large homologous domains, L1 and L2, separated by a cysteine-rich region. Recently, a crystal structure of the first three domains of the IGFI receptor (residues 1–462) has been solved confirming this domain structure (11Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M.Z. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); however, this IGFIR fragment does not bind ligand. In the IR we have shown that, in addition to the first three domains (residues 1–468), only a small peptide from the C-terminal of the α-subunit (704–719) is needed to obtain binding of insulin with the same affinity as the intact IR ectodomain (12Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but a similarly minimized IGFIR has not been described. The insulin and IGFI systems share common binding epitopes on ligands as well as receptors. The two ligands, insulin and IGFI, have similar amino acid sequences, but one binds weakly to the receptor for the other. However, we have demonstrated that it is possible to make a single chain hybrid between insulin and IGFI that binds with high affinity to both receptors (13Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Hach M. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Kjeldsen T. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This single-chain insulin/IGFI hybrid (ICP) consists of insulin A and B chains connected by the C-domain from IGFI. The similarity of the binding sites of the receptors have been demonstrated with chimeric receptors in which discrete domains of one receptor replaced the corresponding domain of the other receptor. The chimeric receptor studies have produced a consensus that N-terminal sequences of the insulin receptor are critical for high-affinity insulin binding, whereas the cysteine-rich domain of IGFIR is essential for high-affinity IGFI binding (14Andersen A.S.

Schlessinger J. Brandenburg D. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19288-19295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the N terminus of the insulin receptor has also been demonstrated by cross-linking (16Wedekind F. Baer-Pontzen K. Bala-Mohan S. Choli D. Zahn H. Brandenburg D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and by alanine scanning mutagenesis (17Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) In addition to N-terminal regions, the C-terminal of the IR α-subunit containing residues 704–719 has in particular been suggested to be important for ligand binding. This has been suggested by cross-linking (18Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Carroll R. Schwartz G.P. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29190-29197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by alanine scanning mutagenesis (19Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, alanine scanning has demonstrated that Phe-701 of IGFIR (corresponds to Phe-714 in IR) is important for the binding of IGFI to IGFIR (20Mynarcik D.C. Williams P.F. Schäffer L. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Also strongly stressing the importance of this C-terminal region are our findings with the minimized IR as mentioned above (12Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of the C-terminal α-subunit for ligand binding specificity in the insulin receptor family, we decided to investigate minimized IR, IGFIR, as well as chimera between these receptors also including constructs with the C-terminal region of IRRR. Insulin, IGFI, and Tyr-A14-125I-insulin and Tyr-31-125I-IGFI were from Novo Nordisk. The ICP consists of insulin with the C-domain of IGFI, and a detailed description of this construct including purification is found elsewhere (13Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Hach M. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Kjeldsen T. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DNA restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were from New England Biolabs, Pwo polymerase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Preparation of plasmid DNA and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed according to standard methods. For DNA minipreps, QIAprep 8 kit was used (QIAGEN). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was from Pierce Chemical Co. An overview of the receptor constructs and the abbreviations used is shown in Fig. 1 and Table I. The receptor constructs comprise the first three domains of one receptor (IR or IGFIR) combined with a short C-terminal sequence from either of the three receptors IR, IGFIR, or IRRR. The receptor sequences were fused to a C-terminal sequence encoding the Flag epitope (SDYKDDDDK), and inserted into the Zem expression vector (14Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M.

The minimized insulin receptor IRΔ703, which has previously been described (12Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was used as template for constructing mIR which was made by extending the IRΔ703 sequence with a Flag sequence using PCR. The antisense oligonucleotide used was 5′-TTTTTCTAGACTACTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAGATGGCCTAGGGACGAAAACC-3′ (XbaI site underlined) and a sense primer upstream from NheI site (amino acids 466–467).

Open table in a new tab The mIGFIR that consists of IGFIR residues 1–458 and 691–706 fused to a C-terminal Flag epitope was made by PCR amplifying an IGFIR deletion construct (similar to IRΔ703 described above) with the antisense primer: 5′-TTTTTCTAGACTACTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTTCAGGTCTGGGCACGAAGATGG-3′ (XbaI site underlined) and a sense primer upstream from NheI site (amino acids 456–457). The PCR fragment was digested with NheI and XbaI and ligated into the corresponding site of plasmid encoding an IGFIR deletion construct. The mIR.IGFIR construct was obtained by replacing a 60-base pairNheI/XbaI fragment of IRΔ703 with the corresponding fragment from mIGFIR, and conversely IGFIR.IR was obtained by replacing a NheI/XbaI fragment of mIGFIR with the corresponding fragment from mIR. For making chimeric receptors with IRRR sequence in the C terminus, the IRRR sequence 685–699 was first fused to amino acid 468 of IR. This was obtained by amplifying the IRΔ703 DNA sequence using a sense primer upstream from Bsu36I site (amino acids 417–419) and the antisense primer 5′-TGGCCTAGGGATGGTGATCGCGTTGTGTAGAAAGTTTTCAAACTTCAGCTAGCCTTGTCCCC (AvrII site is underlined). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with Bsu36I and AvrII and ligated into the corresponding site of the plasmid encoding IRΔ703. From this plasmid, the BamHI/AvrII sequence was inserted into mIR resulting in the plasmid encoding mIR.IRRR, and finally the IR sequence of this plasmid was replaced with the IGFIR sequence by taking the BamHI/NheI fragment from mIGFIR plasmid, resulting in the plasmid encoding mIGFIR.IRRR. For expression of receptors in cultured BHK cells, the expression vectors were transfected into cells by the LipofectAMINETM procedure for stable transfection of adherent cells (Life Technologies Inc.). Prior to transfection, BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded to 20–40% confluency 16–24 h prior to transfection, and the medium was replaced 1 h prior to transfection. Plasmid DNA (2 μg) was mixed with 7 μl of LipofectAMINETM in a total volume of 200 μl of serum-free medium, this mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature before adding 0.8 ml of serum-free medium and overlaying onto the rinsed cells. After incubation for 5 h, 1 ml of DMEM containing 20% fetal calf serum was added, and then cells were incubated for 16 h before removing DNA by replacing medium with DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. After an additional 48 h, cells were passaged to selection medium containing 1 μmmethotrexate. After 10–14 days, individual colonies were isolated and expression was tested by insulin binding assay or by immunoblotting using Flag antibody. Selected BHK clones were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 μmmethotrexate. Receptors with C-terminal Flag epitope were purified by affinity chromatography using immobilized M2 Flag antibody from Sigma. Flag affinity gel was mixed with BHK culture supernatant and incubated at 4 °C overnight before washing with TBS (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl), and the bound receptor proteins were eluted with 0.1 mg/ml Flag peptide in TBS, 0.02% (w/v) sodium-azide. Purified receptors were stored in elution buffer at 4 °C. The IRΔ703 receptor was purified as described previously (12Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The expressed receptors were detected by immunoblotting using three antibodies. Flag-tagged proteins were detected using an antibody against the M2 Flag epitope. For detecting insulin receptors, the monoclonal antibody mAb-F26 was used. This antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 39–75, mapping at the N terminus of the insulin receptor α-subunit. The antibody was kindly donated by Jes Thorn Clausen, Novo-Nordisk. For detecting IGFIR, the IGFIRα (N-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology was used, this is an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 31–50, mapping at the N terminus of IGFIR. For blotting, samples were mixed with 0.33 volumes of loading buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min before loading on a 4–12% polyacrylamide Bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE, Novex). After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked by incubating with blocking buffer (2% defatted skim milk, 2% BSA in TBS) for 16 h at 4 °C. The receptor antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA in TBS, and immunoreactive protein was detected using ECL reagent from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. For displacement binding analysis, a suitable dilution of purified receptor was incubated in a total volume of 200 μl with 15 pm of 125I-insulin or125I-IGFI and various concentrations of unlabeled ligand (insulin, IGFI, or ICP) in binding buffer (100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (w/v) BSA, 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100) for 16 h at 4 °C. Subsequently bound counts were recovered by precipitation with 0.2% γ-globulin and 500 μl of 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. Bound125I-labeled hormone was counted in a γ-counter. The concentration of receptor was adjusted to yield 10–15% binding when no competing ligand was added in the competition assay. The binding data were fitted using nonlinear regression algorithm in GraphPad Prism 2.01 (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA). For chemical cross-linking, 125I-insulin or125I-IGFI was used, and cross-linking was performed essentially as described (14Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2722-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Affinity purified receptor constructs were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with labeled ligand (0.2–0.3 nm) in the presence or absence of unlabeled ligand (1 μm). DSS in dimethyl sulfoxide was added from a 10 mm stock solution to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 15 min on ice, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.33 volume of loading buffer containing 100 mmdithiothreitol. Samples were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min before running on a 4–12% polyacrylamide Bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE, Novex). The gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid, 20% ethanol, and a PhosphorImager screen was exposed with the dried gel. The minimized IGFI receptor (mIGFIR) was mixed with 125I-IGFI (∼200,000 cpm), allowed to equilibrate, and analyzed with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system, using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, HCl buffer, pH 7.5, with 100 mmNaCl. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. Radioactivity in fractions was counted on a γ-counter. Aldolase (M r 158,000), BSA (M r 67,000), ovalbumin (M r 43,000), and ribonuclease A (M r 13,700) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech were used for calibration of the column. We previously expressed a minimized insulin receptor (IRΔ703) consisting of the first three domains of the insulin receptor fused directly to 16 amino acids of the C-terminal of the α-subunit (residues 704–719) (12Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study the Flag epitope was added to the C-terminal of the IRΔ703, resulting in the mIR construct, and in addition similar constructs were made from the IGFIR sequence and various chimera based on these receptors (Fig. 1, Table I). In all constructs, a NheI restriction site was introduced corresponding to amino acids 466–467 of IR (Fig. 1), and this site allowed shuffling the C-terminal domain from one receptor to the other as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1 and Table I). All constructs were stably expressed in BHK cells, and the C-terminal Flag epitope facilitated purification and detection of receptors using Flag antibody. Receptors with Flag epitope were purified by absorbing on anti-Flag M2 affinity column and eluting with 0.1 mg/ml of Flag peptide. This procedure enabled purification of all receptors using the same protocol. Efficient purification is required especially when investigating IGFI binding to avoid interference from IGFI and IGFI binding proteins present in serum and secreted by BHK cells (23Blum W.F. Jenne E.W. Reppin F. Kietzmann K. Ranke M.B. Bierich J.R. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2is shown purification of two of the IGFIR-based receptors (mIGFIR and mIGFIR.IR). In both BHK supernatants (lanes 1 and6), the dominating protein that cross-links IGFI has mobility corresponding to approximately 38 kDa which is the size expected for IGFI binding protein (30 kDa) cross-linked to IGFI (8 kDa), whereas the receptor/IGFI complex with an apparent mass of approximately 80 kDa is seen as a faint band in the BHK supernatant of mIGFIR (Fig. 2, lane 1) and is not visible at all in mIGFIR.IR (lane 6). After absorption to the anti-Flag column, the binding protein is found in the flow-through (lanes 2 and 7), whereas no bands smaller than the 80-kDa receptor/IGFI band in the eluates is apparent, demonstrating efficient elimination of binding protein using this affinity purification. In addition to the 80-kDa band comprising receptor, there seems to be a fainter band of higher molecular mass that could be a dimeric mini-receptor. To investigate the stoichiometry further, we mixed the mIGFIR with 125I-IGFI and then separated this complex on a Superose 12 gel filtration column. The elution profile is shown in Fig. 3. Clearly the majority of receptor bound IGFI elutes near the BSA (67 kDa) marker which is consistent with a monomeric receptor, and a smaller fraction elutes earlier corresponding toM r higher than 158,000. The purified receptor constructs were confirmed by immunoblotting. The antibody that recognizes the Flag epitope should detect all constructs except IRΔ703 (Fig. 1), whereas the antibodies specific for the N terminus of IR or IGFIR should verify that the N terminus of the constructs are correct. The immunoblots are shown in Fig. 4. In panel A is shown the proteins detected with the antibody specific for the Flag peptide sequence. The Flag sequence is detected in all the new receptor constructs (lanes 2–7). The size of the immunoreactive proteins is about 80 kDa for the IR constructs (lanes 2–4) and is somewhat lower (72 kDa) for the IGFIR constructs (lanes 5–7). This difference in part reflects that mIR is longer than mIGFIR (492 versus 482 amino acids). In addition, mIGFIR is probably less glycosylated than mIR because the mIGFIR have only seven potential N-glycosylation sites, whereas mIR has ten sites. Immunoblotting using the receptor-specific antibodies, shown in Fig. 4 B, reveals bands similar to what was detected with the Flag antibody (lanes 2–7). In addition, the IRΔ703 is now detected using the IR antibody (panel B, lane 1). We have not investigated how efficient the purification procedure is, but the immunoblots indicate that the amounts of chimeric receptors with the C-terminal IRRR domain (lanes 4 and 7) are not dramatically lower than what is found for the other mini-receptors, indicating that the IRRR domain is well tolerated in mIR as well as mIGFIR context. As demonstrated by cross-linking (Fig. 2) and gel filtration (Fig. 3), there is a small receptor fraction that dimerizes or aggregates to molecular mass higher than 158 kDa, and this probably accounts for the faint higher molecular mass band observed on the blots (Fig. 4,panels A and B). The purified receptors were analyzed in a competition binding assay. For the three receptors that contain the N terminus of the insulin receptor (mIR, mIR.IGFIR, and mIR.IRRR), labeled insulin was used as tracer, and for the constructs based on IGFIR (mIGFIR, mIGFIR.IR, and mIGFIR.IRRR), labeled IGFI was used. Binding curves are shown in Fig. 5, and an overview of the affinities is presented in Table I. To evaluate the Flag tag approach, we compared mIR with the untagged IRΔ703 receptor (12Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The binding affinities found for these two receptors are similar for insulin and ICP, whereas for IGFI, the mIR has slightly increased affinity (2.5-fold) compared with IRΔ703. As the Flag epitope only has minor effects on ligand binding, we decided that this system was useful for investigating members of the insulin receptor family. The second conclusion from the binding studies is that the IRRR domain in the C-terminal abolishes binding of insulin in mIR context and abolishes binding of IGFI in mIGFIR context. As described above, the mIR.IRRR and mIGFIR.IRRR proteins are expressed and purified as judged by immunoblotting (Fig. 4), and therefore we conclude that replacing the cognate C-terminal sequence with that of IRRR directly affects the epitope that interacts with ligand. For the constructs that contain the first three domains of IR (mIR, IRΔ703, and mIR.IGFIR), the binding affinities for either of the three ligands was comparable from one receptor to the other (less than 5-fold differences), and in addition these receptors displayed poor specificity, all affinities ranging from 3.6 to 35 nm. The affinities for insulin and ICP were 4–6 nm, which is similar to the affinity of the soluble IR ectodomain (sIR) for insulin (14Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S. Norris K. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7363-7366Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Kjeldsen T. Andersen A.S. Wiberg F.C. Rasmussen J.S. Schäffer L. Balschmidt P. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4404-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contast to sIR that has approximately 100-fold specificity for binding insulin compared with IGFI (14Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S. Norris K. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7363-7366Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), these minimized IR constructs only have 3–6-fold lower affinity for IGFI compared with insulin. As the affinity for insulin is unchanged, the loss in specificity must be ascribed to higher affinity for IGFI (15–35 nm) in mIR and IRΔ703 as compared with sIR, 500–800 nm (14Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S. Norris K. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7363-7366Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Kjeldsen T. Andersen A.S.

For the constructs with the first three domains of IGFIR, the binding affinities of the three ligands were conserved when swapping to the C-terminal of IR (less than two-fold differences), but in clear contrast to mIR, the mIGFIR-based receptors retain high specificity (>1000-fold). The affinity of the mIGFIR for IGFI is 1.5 nm, whereas insulin has an EC50 of more than 3000 nm (<0.05%), and ICP is close to IGFI with 9.8 nm (16%). The affinities for IGFI and ICP (1.5 and 9.8 nm) are approximately 4-fold lower than has been reported for the soluble IGFIR ectodomain (0.4 and 1.9 nm) (13Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Hach M. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Kjeldsen T. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S. Norris K.

Møller N.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4404-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but the relative affinities are unchanged. The binding data for chimeric receptors based on both IR and IGFIR demonstrate that inserting the C-terminal domain from the non-cognate receptor does not change ligand binding characteristics. In other words, the C-terminal domains are interchangeable with respect to ligand binding, and accordingly this domain appears to be part of the common binding site in these receptors. Labeled ligands were chemically cross-linked to receptor constructs with DSS, and the gels are shown in Fig. 6. The cross-linking pattern shows specific binding of tracers to the constructs with IR or IGFIR sequence in the C terminus, all yielding bands with apparent mass between 66 and 97 kDa (lanes 1, 3, 5, 9, and 11), whereas the two constructs with the C-terminal domain from IRRR (lanes 7 and 13) do not present any bands, in accordance with our findings that mIR.IRRR and mIGFIR.IRRR do not bind ligand in the soluble binding assay. To standardize and simplify the purification of multiple receptors with varying domains and binding characteristics, we constructed the minimized receptors with a C-terminal 8- amino acid Flag epitope. The presence of this epitope permits a mild single-step purification of the receptors, and more importantly this procedure efficiently eliminates the IGFI binding proteins present in the BHK cell culture medium (23Blum W.F. Jenne E.W. Reppin F. Kietzmann K. Ranke M.B. Bierich J.R. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The Flag epitope is close to the ligand binding domain that we wanted to study, and thus it could interfere with binding as has been demonstrated in IR with exon 11 (24Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32639-32648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that ligand binding of the minimized IR (IRΔ703) is not influenced by the exon11 region (12Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and here we observe no difference in affinity for insulin between IRΔ703 and mIR which has the Flag epitope. We thus concluded that the Flag epitope does not affect ligand binding in the mini-receptors. We have previously reported that the ligand binding domain of IR can be minimized by expressing the first three IR domains (468 amino acids) fused to the C-terminal 16 amino acids of the α-subunit (residues 704–719) (12Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This minimized receptor (IRΔ703) binds insulin with affinity similar to the full-length IR ectodomain (soluble IR). In the present study, we have expressed a similar minimized IGFIR construct and four chimeric mini-receptors. The minimized IGFIR construct is particularly interesting because the x-ray structure of the first three domains of IGFIR was solved recently (11Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M.Z. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and this structure led to suggestions of a putative central site that could accommodate IGFI. In the x-ray structure, the C-terminal of the L2 domain does not face the putative ligand binding lobe, whereas our data show that only 16 amino acids fused to this C terminus induces binding of IGFI. The binding affinity of mIGFIR for IGFI (1.5 nm) was approximately 4-fold lower than that found for the soluble ectodomain of IGFIR (sIGFIR) (0.3–0.4 nm) (14Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S. Norris K. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7363-7366Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Vissing H. Schäffer L. Rasmussen J.S. De Meyts P. Møller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13681-13686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in terms of specificity, it remains highly specific for IGFI compared with insulin (>1000-fold). In terms of binding cognate ligand, the minimized IR more faithfully reflected the binding characteristics of the ectodomain; mIR and IRΔ703 have retained the full binding activity of the IR ectodomain (sIR), all having affinities of 5–6 nm for insulin. Although mIR (and IRΔ703) have unchanged affinity for insulin, they have increased affinity for IGFI compared with sIR, resulting in the mini-IRs having almost the same affinities for insulin and IGFI, with the affinity for IGFI being only 3–6-fold lower than affinity for insulin (Table I). The low specificity of the minimized insulin receptors is puzzling, we speculate that because the sIR have all the epitopes required for binding IGFI with 20 nm affinity (like mIR and IRΔ703), there must be something inhibiting receptor-IGFI interaction in sIR. Possibly some of the regions deleted in the minimized IRs interfere with IGFI binding in sIR, or maybe the dimeric conformation of sIR interferes with IGFI attaining the higher affinity. Despite that the primary sequence of IRRR is as similar to IR and IGFIR as the IR and IGFIR are to each other (4Shier P. Watt V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14605-14608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no binding of insulin, IGFI, or any other ligand has been observed with the IRRR. In the present setup we have investigated the role of the short C-terminal domain of the IRRR α-subunit in mIR and mIGFIR context. The clear conclusion from these chimeric receptors is that the C terminus of IRRR abolishes binding of insulin and IGFI. This is somewhat surprising because only four of the residues in the C-terminal region (IR residues 704–719) are different from corresponding positions of both IR and IGFIR (Fig. 1 C). One of these four residues, alanine 694, has been shown by alanine scanning mutagenesis to be acceptable at corresponding position 712 in IR (19Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Chimeric receptors between IR and IRRR have been described previously, Zhang and Roth (26Zhang B. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18320-18328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that a chimeric receptor with the extracellular domain of IR and the kinase domain of IRRR exhibited high affinity insulin binding and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity. They also made a chimeric receptor with the cysteine-rich region of IR (exon 3) replaced with the homologous region of IRRR that was shown to bind insulin with affinity similar to that of wild type IR; however, when replacing both exon 2 and exon 3 of IR with IRRR domains, no binding of insulin was detected (27Zhang B. Roth R.A. Biochem. 1991; 30: 5113-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The chimeric mini-receptors show that replacing the C-terminal domain of IR with the corresponding domain of IGFIR only has minor effect on ligand binding. This is also true for mIGFIR with the C terminus of IR. So within IR and IGFIR, the C-terminal domains are interchangeable in terms of ligand binding, suggesting that this domain is part of the common binding site of these receptors. We have previously characterized ICP, which consists of insulin with IGFI C-domain, against various IR and IGFIR. The conclusion was that ICP binds with high affinity to IR (55–113% of insulin) and with 19–28% of IGFI affinity to IGFIR (13Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Hach M. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Kjeldsen T. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we get similar results for relative binding affinities for mini-receptors. The affinity of ICP for mIR and IRΔ703 was not different from the affinity of insulin. For mIGFIR, the affinity of ICP was 16% of IGFI, and thus previous conclusions that the C-domain of IGFI is a major determinant of IGFIR specificity for IGFI is true also for the minimized IGFIR. Based on the chimeric mini-receptors, we conclude that the C-terminal domain of IRRR abolishes binding of ligand and that swapping of C-terminal sequences from IR to IGFIR or vice versa does not influence ligand binding dramatically, indicating that this region is part of the common binding site in these receptors. Finally we have demonstrated that it is possible to make a minimized IGFIR that binds IGFI, this mIGFIR receptor consists of the first three domains of IGFIR fused to 16 amino acids from the C terminus of the α-subunit. The short C-terminal domain is essential for binding ligand, whereas the crystal structure for the remaining 462 amino acids has been solved (11Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M.Z. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and, therefore, the minimized IGFIR is a good candidate for crystallizing an IGFIR fragment with bound ligand. We thank Jannie Ovesen, Else Jost Jensen, and Lene Drube for excellent technical assistance."

We here show that the dimerization region in GAD65 is distinct from the NH2-terminal membrane-anchoring region and that a membrane anchoring GAD65 subunit can indeed target a soluble subunit to membrane compartments by dimerization. However, only a fraction of membrane-bound GAD67 is engaged in a heterodimer with GAD65 in rat brain. Furthermore, in GAD65−/− mouse brain, GAD67, which no longer partitions into the Triton X-114 detergent phase, still anchors to membranes at similar levels as in wild-type mice. Similarly, in primary cultures of neurons derived from GAD65−/− mice, GAD67 is targeted to nerve terminals, where it co-localizes with the synaptic vesicle marker SV2. Thus, axonal targeting and membrane anchoring is an intrinsic property of GAD67 and does not require GAD65. The results suggest that three distinct moieties of glutamate decarboxylase localize to membrane compartments, an amphiphilic GAD65 homodimer, an amphiphilic GAD65/67 heterodimer, tethered to membranes via the GAD65 subunit, and a hydrophilic GAD67 homodimer, which associates with membranes by a distinct mechanism.

GAD is expressed at comparable levels in GABA-ergic neurons in the central nervous system and in the insulin-producing β cells in the islets of Langerhans (2Okada Y. Taniguchi H. Shimada C.

GABA has been established as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, whereas its role in islet cell function remains elusive (4Michalik M. Nelson J. Erecinska M. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1506-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mammalian species express two isoforms of GAD designated GAD65 and GAD67 in accordance with their relative molecular masses in kDa (3Erlander M.G. Tillakaratne N.J.K. Feldblum S. Pate N. Tobin A.J.

Although the two proteins differ substantially in the first 95 NH2-terminal amino acids, they share a significant homology in the remaining part of the molecule, which contains the catalytic portion of the enzyme (∼78% identity, ∼95% similarity). GAD65 and GAD67 show significant differences in their levels of expression in different brain regions and steady state saturation with the co-enzyme pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) (1Martin D.L. Rimvall K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). More than half of GAD in rat brain is present as the PLP-free apoenzyme (7Miller L.P. Walters J.R. Eng N.

GAD67 constitutes a small fraction of the apo-GAD reservoir in the brain (11Kash S.F. Johnson R.S. Tecott L.H. Noebels J.L. Mayfield R.D. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GAD65, but not GAD67, is a major target of autoimmune responses directed against pancreatic β cells in type 1 diabetes (12Baekkeskov S. Aanstoot H.J. Christgau S. Reetz A. Solimena M. Cascalho M.

Aparisi R. Pozza G. De Camilli P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Most biochemical studies on the quaternary structure of purified GAD are consistent with the idea that the basic subunit structure is dimeric (1Martin D.L. Rimvall K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 15Erlander M.G. Tobin A.J. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). High resolution mapping of conformational epitopes in GAD65, together with two- and three-dimensional structure prediction and alignment of structural folds with decarboxylases of known structure, resulted in a model of the GAD65 dimer (16Schwartz H. Chandonia J-M. Kash S.F. Kanaani J. Tunnel E. Domingo A. Cohen F.E. Banga J.P. Madec A-M. Richter W. Baekkeskov S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 983-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this model, the two GAD65 subunits are joined in the middle region (amino acids 201–461) and related by a P21 symmetry. In a separate analysis, several residues in the middle domain were predicted to reach into the cofactor-binding site of the other subunit and interact directly with the phosphate group of PLP and with residues in the other subunit of the enzyme (17Qu K. Martin D.L. Lawrence C.E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1092-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the middle domains of GAD65 and GAD67 seem to be responsible for the basic homodimeric structure of the enzyme. GAD65 and GAD67 can also associate with each other to form heterodimers (9Kaufman D.L. Houser C.R. Tobin A.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 18Dirkx R.

Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2082-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and this association has been attributed to the NH2-terminal domain of GAD65 (18Dirkx R. Thomas A. Li L. Lernmark Å. Sherwin R.S. De Camilli P. Solimena M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2241-2246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is estimated that GAD65/GAD67 heterodimers constitute ∼28% of the total GAD activity in cerebellar membranes (19Sheikh S.N. Martin D.L. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2082-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both GAD65 and GAD67 are synthesized in the cytosol as hydrophilic and soluble molecules (20Christgau S.H. Schierbeck H.

GAD65 undergoes a stepwise post-translational modification in the NH2-terminal domain to become hydrophobic and then reversibly membrane-anchored to synaptic-like microvesicles in β cells and synaptic vesicles in neurons (21Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 22Christgau S. Aanstoot H.J. Schierbeck H. Begley K. Tullin S. Hejnaes K. Baekkeskov S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A pool of GAD65 is also detected in the Golgi complex region of neurons, pancreatic β cells, and transfected CHO and COS-7 cells (23Solimena M. Aggujaro D. Muntzel C. Dirkx R. Butler M. De Camilli P.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The nature and significance of the association of GAD65 with membranes is not well understood. The NH2-terminal domain in GAD65 is required for membrane anchoring and is the site of two hydrophobic modifications. One of them involves the thiopalmitoylation of cysteines 30 and 45 (22Christgau S. Aanstoot H.J. Schierbeck H. Begley K. Tullin S. Hejnaes K. Baekkeskov S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), whereas the other modification (20Christgau S.H. Schierbeck H. Aanstoot H.J. Aagard L. Begley K. Kofod H. Hejnaes K. Baekkeskov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21257-21264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has remained undefined. GAD65 also undergoes phosphorylation of serines 3, 6, 10, and 13 (25Namchuk M. Lindsay L. Turk C.W. Kanaani J. Baekkeskov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1548-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although both palmitoylation and phosphorylation distinguish the membrane-associated from the soluble forms of GAD65, neither modification is required for membrane anchoring of GAD65 in COS-7 cells (25Namchuk M.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It was also shown that targeting of GAD65 to the Golgi complex region in transfected CHO cells requires a signal located in the NH2-terminal region, which is different from palmitoylation (24Solimena M. Dirkx R. Radzynski M. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). GAD67 has both distinct and similar subcellular localizations. In rat β cells and in transfected rat fibroblasts, GAD67 was found to remain distributed homogeneously throughout the cell cytosol and was recovered only in soluble fractions (20Christgau S.H.

In the present study, we have addressed the role of GAD65-GAD67 heterodimerization in the subcellular targeting and membrane anchoring of GAD67. We demonstrate that formation of GAD65/67 heterodimers is specific and does not involve nonspecific formation of disulfide-linked bridges between any domains of the proteins. Furthermore, a soluble mutant of GAD65 can be targeted to membranes by dimerization with wild-type protein, suggesting that membrane anchoring of one GAD65 subunit is sufficient for membrane localization of the GAD65 dimer and supporting the notion that membrane anchoring of soluble GAD67 can be mediated by its association with GAD65. Analyses of GAD65−/− mice, however, reveal that membrane anchoring and targeting of GAD67 to nerve terminals is not affected by loss of GAD65 and therefore can also be effected independently of the GAD65 isoform.

The following antibodies were used in immunofluorescence experiments: (i) the GAD65-specific human monoclonal antibodies MICA 2, 3, and 6, derived from islet cell antibody positive patients, were a gift from Dr. Wiltrud Richter (29Richter W.

Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) was kindly donated by Drs. Peter Sargent and Regis Kelly (University of California, San Francisco). All secondary antibodies used in immunofluorescence experiments were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Wild-type rat GAD65, a deletion mutant of rGAD65 lacking amino acids 1–38 and having the palmitoylation site, Cys45, mutated to Ala (rGAD65/45AΔ1–38), and a deletion mutant of rGAD65 lacking amino acids 1–101 (rGAD65Δ1–101) in the COS expression vector pSV-SPORT were described previously (26Shi Y. Veit B. Baekkeskov S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A 2.0-kb cDNA for mouse GAD67 (a gift from Dr. Roland Tisch, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) containing the entire coding region and 93 and 181 bp of 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences, respectively, was excised from Bluescript II SK± (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as anXhoI–XhoI fragment and subcloned into theSalI site of the pSV-SPORT vector. COS-7 cells were cultured and transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (25Namchuk M. Lindsay L. Turk C.W. Kanaani J. Baekkeskov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1548-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transfected COS-7 cells from an 80–90% confluent 10-cm plate were washed twice in ice-cold cell harvesting buffer (20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmbenzamidine/HCl) and extracted by incubation on a shaker for 1 h at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of hypotonic Hepes buffer (HMAP buffer) (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide, 0.2 mmPLP, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmbenzamidine, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)) containing 1% Triton X-114. The lysate was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble debris. Subcellular fractionation of cells was carried out using a modification of methods described previously (26Shi Y. Veit B. Baekkeskov S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Transfected COS-7 cells, grown to 80–90% confluency in a 10-cm plate, were washed twice in ice-cold cell harvesting buffer and homogenized on ice using a glass homogenizer with 0.5 ml of HMAP buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cellular debris. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × gfor 1 h in a TLA 100.3 rotor using a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) to separate cytosol and crude membrane fractions. Sedimented membranes were resuspended in 0.5 ml of membrane washing buffer (HMAP buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl) and incubated for 1 h, followed by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h to pellet the washed membranes. Washed membranes were extracted for 1 h with 0.5 ml of extraction buffer (HMAP buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-114) followed by centrifugation for 1 h at 150,000 × g to separate particulate extract from insoluble debris. For the subcellular fractionation of rat and mouse brain, Harlan Sprague Dawley male rats (250–300 g) were anesthetized with metofane, and the cerebral cortex and cerebellum were dissected quickly. A 15% (w/v) portion of tissue in HMAP buffer was homogenized with the use of a Tissumizer polytron (Tekmar, Cincinnati, OH). The rest of the procedure was carried out as described above for COS-7 cells. Triton X-114 partitioning assays were performed on the subcellular fractions of mouse brain using a modification of the procedure of Bordier (31Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 256: 1604-1607Google Scholar). For comparative analyses of the amphiphilic properties of GAD65 and GAD67 in subcellular fractions, buffer compositions were adjusted to achieve identical conditions in each fraction. Aliquots of each fraction were subjected to three rounds of temperature-induced phase transitions using 1% Triton X-114. Following the incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the detergent and aqueous phases were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min at room temperature. The detergent phase from the first and second rounds of phase separations was washed carefully with HMAP buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and resuspended with the same buffer to the original volume. Triton X-114 was added to the aqueous phase obtained after the third round of phase separation to a final concentration of 1%. For the immunoprecipitation of GAD65 from cell-free extracts of transfected COS-7 cells, an aliquot of 250 μl from each extract was incubated with 30 μl of the GAD65-specific monoclonal antibody, FL-17, for 2 h at 4 °C with constant shaking. Immunocomplexes were isolated by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of 50% solution of protein G-Sepharose (PGS; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in immunoprecipitation buffer (IP buffer, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 10 mm benzamidine, and 0.5% Triton X-114). For the immunoprecipitation of GAD65 from rat brain subcellular fractions, 100-μl aliquots from each of the cytosol and membrane extracts were diluted 5-fold in HMAP buffer containing 1% Triton X-114 and 150 mm NaCl and precleared by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with 100 μl of preswollen protein A-Sepharose (PAS; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in IP buffer. Samples were then centrifuged at 750 × g for 1 min, and the resulting supernatants were incubated with 5 μl of GAD6 ascites. After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C with constant shaking, immunocomplexes were isolated by incubation with 100 μl of preswollen PAS for 1 h at 4 °C. The PGS- or PAS-bound immunocomplexes were washed five times with IP buffer, and proteins were eluted from PGS or PAS by boiling for 5 min in SDS-sample buffer followed by centrifugation to remove PAS or PGS. To estimate the subunit composition of native GAD65 transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, samples from the cell lysate obtained after removing the cell debris were pretreated in nondenaturing and nonreducing sample buffer (0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.003% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) and then analyzed by electrophoresis on a native precast 10 or 4–20% linear gradient of polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Standard molecular mass proteins for native gels were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and consisted of thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa). For the analysis under nonreducing conditions to test the presence of disulfide-linked multimers of GAD65, samples were boiled for 3 min in sample buffer containing 2% SDS without reducing agent and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels. For quantitative analyses of the ratio of GAD65 and GAD67 in immunoprecipitates and in cytosol and membrane fractions of brain, serial dilutions of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred from gels by Western blotting to Protran BA nitrocellulose transfer membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). All procedures were carried out at room temperature. The blots were blocked for 1 h in 10% nonfat dry milk, TBST buffer (20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). After two 5-min washes with TBST, the blots were probed for 1 h with the 1701 antibody (1:5000 dilution in 5% milk, TBST), followed by three 5-min washes with TBST. The blots were then incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a 1:8000 dilution in TBST. After three 5-min washes with TBS, 0.3% Tween 20 and three 5-min washes with TBST, bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For quantitative analyses, images made on Kodak X-Omat film were obtained at various times of exposure, and the percentages of GAD65 and GAD67 were determined from the linear range of the standard curve. Scanning of autoradiograms was performed using the DeskScan II program on a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIcx. Densitometric analysis was performed using NIH Image software. Primary cultures of dissociated cerebral cortical neurons were prepared from the brains of 18-day-old mouse fetuses, which were recovered by caesarean section under metofane anesthetic. Heterozygous (GAD65+/−) and homozygous mutant (GAD65−/−) mouse fetuses were obtained by breeding homozygous male (GAD65−/−) and heterozygous female (GAD65+/−) mice on the 129 × NOD background as described previously (11Kash S.F. Johnson R.S. Tecott L.H. Noebels J.L. Mayfield R.D. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The cortex was dissected from the brains of five fetuses out of seven, and the cultures were prepared from each cortex separately. In parallel, DNA was extracted from tail biopsies of the five fetuses and was used later for genotyping (see below). The cortex was dissected on ice in 2 ml of dissection buffer (160 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgSO4, 2.9 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Hepes, 5.5 mm glucose, 2 mg/liter phenol red, pH 7.4). Tissue fragments were added to 5 ml of dissection buffer containing papain (100 units; Worthington), l-cysteine (1 mg), CaCl2 (1 mm), and EDTA (0.5 mm) and incubated for 30 min with constant shaking at 37 °C. Papain digestion was terminated by resuspension of the tissue fragments in 5 ml of B27/Neurobasal culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1 mm GlutaMAX I, a 50 units/ml concentration of both streptomycin and penicillin (32Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar), 12.5 mg of bovine serum albumin, and 12.5 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor. After the tissue had settled, the supernatant was replaced with 1 ml of culture medium. Individual cells were generated by trituration of the tissue seven times, each time in 1 ml of culture medium. After the nondispersed tissue had settled, the supernatants were transferred to a 15-ml tube and centrifuged at 200 × g for 3 min. The pellet was gently resuspended in culture medium containing 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum to reach a density of 1.7 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were plated on sterile glass coverslips (2 × 105 cells/coverslip) precoated with poly-d-lysine (M r >300,000; Sigma) and collagen (Vitrogen 100, Collagen Corp., Fremont, CA) in 24-well plastic culture dishes (32Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. One-half of the growth medium was exchanged 1 day after plating and every 3 days thereafter. Hippocampi of P0 Harlan Sprague Dawley rat pups were removed, and the dentate gyri were grossly dissected. Cells derived from the remaining tissue were plated as described by Lester et al. (33Lester R.A.J. Quarum M.L. Parker J.D. Weber E. Jahr C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 565-570PubMed Google Scholar) except that papain was not used. B27-supplemented primary hippocampal cultures were prepared as described by Brewer et al. (32Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar), and a 50 units/ml concentration of both streptomycin and penicillin were added. One-half of the growth medium was exchanged 1 day after plating and weekly thereafter. After 2 weeks of growth, cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. All of the subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. Permeabilization of the cells and blocking of nonspecific binding were performed by incubation for 20 min with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (blocking buffer). For co-localization of both GAD65 and GAD67 in rat hippocampal neurons, the human monoclonal antibodies to GAD65 (MICA 2, 3, and 6, diluted 1:250) along with rabbit antibodies to GAD67 (K2, diluted 1:250) were applied in blocking buffer. After 1 h of incubation, immunoreactivity was visualized by secondary antibody staining using donkey anti-human IgG conjugated to Cy3 and goat"
https://openalex.org/W2009556869,"The biological effects of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation may differ between epidermal suprabasal and basal keratinocytes, since growth factors are mitogenic in adherent cells only in the presence of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction. To investigate biological effects of EGFR activation on keratinocytes without cell-ECM interaction, we cultured normal human keratinocytes on polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate-coated plates, which disrupt cell-ECM but not cell-cell interaction. The cells initially expressed keratin 10 (K10) and then profilaggrin, mimicking sequential differentiation of epidermal suprabasal keratinocytes. The addition of EGF or transforming growth factor-α promoted late terminal differentiation (profilaggrin expression, type 1 transglutaminase expression and activity, and cornified envelope formation) of the suspended keratinocytes, while suppressing K10 expression, an early differentiation marker. These effects were attenuated by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035 or an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, whereas protein kinase C inhibitors H7 and bisindolylmaleimide I or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 abolished profilaggrin up-regulation but not K10 suppression. Since the antidifferentiative role of EGFR on cell-ECM interaction-conserved keratinocytes has been well documented, our results indicate that the biological effects of EGFR on keratinocytes are influenced by cell-ECM interaction and suggest that EGFR activation promotes rather than inhibits the terminal differentiation of suprabasal epidermal keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1990713423,"We investigated the gene expression and intracellular activity of processing protease furin and its involvement in the process of membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) activation in rabbit dermal fibroblasts. When the rabbit fibroblasts were treated with concanavalin A (ConA), pro-MMP-2 was converted to an active 62-kDa MMP-2 through the appearance of a 64-kDa intermediate MMP-2. The ConA-induced pro-MMP-2 activation resulted from increasing the gene expression and production of MT1-MMP in the rabbit fibroblasts. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that in rabbit dermal fibroblasts furin mRNA was detected and, unlike MT1-MMP, was not increased by ConA. These findings are further supported by the fact that the intracellular furin activity also was constitutively detected and was unchanged by the ConA treatment. Very similar phenomena were also observed in human uterine cervical fibroblasts, which are known to produce MT1-MMP by ConA stimulation. These results suggest that the expression of the furin gene and the intracellular activity are not regulated by ConA. On the other hand, neither a synthetic furin inhibitor, decanoyl-RVKR-CH2Cl (25–100 μm) nor a furin antisense oligonucleotide (40 μm) inhibited the MT1-MMP-mediated pro-MMP-2 activation in ConA-treated rabbit dermal fibroblasts, whereas these compounds interfered with pro-MMP-2 activation in ConA-treated human uterine cervical fibroblasts.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that an autoproteolytic cleavage by furin may be programmed in eliciting MT1-MMP functions such as pro-MMP-2 activation and ECM breakdown by itself (27Ohuchi E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported that MT1-MMP processing by furin is not a prerequisite for pro-MMP-2 activation in a transfection study using COS-1 cells. Therefore, it is not fully understood whether furin would substantially participate in MT1-MMP processing to activate pro-MMP-2. Furthermore, it is of interest whether furin activity and its production could be regulated together with MT1-MMP production. Recently, rabbit MT1-MMP cDNA has been isolated from rabbit osteoclasts (30Sato T. Ovejero M.C. Hou P. Heegaard A.-M. Kumegawa M. Foged N.T. Delaisse J.-M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 589-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and arterial smooth muscle cells (31Wang H. Keiser J.A. J. Vasc. Res. 1998; 35: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence has the furin recognition sequence in the propeptide, presuming that rabbit pro-MT1-MMP activation may be furin-dependent. However, there is no evidence of the regulatory mechanism of rabbit MT1-MMP activation and production to augment the processing of pro-MMP-2. In the present study we demonstrated that concanavalin A (ConA) induced the gene expression and production of MT1-MMP, and thereby pro-MMP-2 activation was augmented. Furin mRNA and its enzymic activity were constitutively expressed but not influenced by ConA in rabbit dermal fibroblasts. On the other hand, neither a furin synthetic inhibitor nor a furin antisense oligonucleotide (F-AS) inhibits the MT1-MMP-mediated pro-MMP-2 activation in the rabbit fibroblasts, suggesting that rabbit MT1-MMP activation is furin-independent. Rabbit dermal fibroblasts were prepared from the back of male Japanese White rabbits by the explant culture method with some modifications (32Vater C.A. Nagase H. Harris Jr., E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9374-9382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Human uterine cervical fibroblasts were cultured in 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum/minimum essential medium (33Ojima Y. Ito A. Nagase H. Mori Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1011: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,34Ito A. Sato T. Ojima Y. Chen L.-C. Nagase H. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13598-13601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The confluent cells were washed once with 0.2% (w/v) lactalbumin hydrolysate/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or minimum essential medium and then treated with or without ConA (10 μg/ml) (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) in the same medium for 24 h. In the experiment with synthetic furin inhibitors, the cells were pretreated with a specific furin inhibitor, decanoyl (Dec)-RVKR-CH2Cl, or a poor furin inhibitor, Dec-RAIR-CH2Cl (35Angliker H. Wikstrom P. Shaw E. Brenner C. Fuller R.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), for 6 h and then treated with these inhibitors together with ConA (10 μg/ml) for 18 h. In the experiment with furin antisense and sense oligonucleotides, a similar treatment was performed with a phosphorothioate-linkage human furin antisense (F-AS) or sense (F-S) oligonucleotide (−8 to 8 bp) (5′-AGC TCC ATG GGG GGG A-3′ and 5′-TCC CCC CCA TGG AGC T-3′, respectively) (36Van den Ouweland A.M.W. Van Duijnhoven H.L.P. Keizer G.D. Dorssers C.J. Van de Ven W.J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 664Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The harvested culture medium was stored at −20 °C until use. The cells were subjected to the preparation of cell lysate and RNA isolation. In this series of experiments, rabbit dermal fibroblasts and human uterine cervical fibroblasts were used at the 1st to the 6th passage level and the 1st to the 11th, respectively. Gelatinolytic activity in the harvested culture media was detected by gelatin zymography with 10% (w/v) acrylamide gel containing gelatin (0.6 mg/ml; Difco) as described previously (37Sato T. Ito A. Ogata Y. Nagase H. Mori Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To monitor the production of MT1-MMP, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (−) once and then scraped into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.05% (w/v) Briji 35 with a rubber policeman. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the cells were resuspended in the same buffer, sonicated 6 times at 4 °C for 10 s, and then centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to Western blot analysis for detection of MT1-MMP. The protein concentration in the samples was determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot (100 μg) of the precipitate was mixed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and then run on 10% (w/v) acrylamide gel. The proteins separated in the gel were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was reacted with human MT1-MMP monoclonal antibody (mAb), which was then complexed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Immunoreactive MT1-MMP was visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as described previously (33Ojima Y. Ito A. Nagase H. Mori Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1011: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,34Ito A. Sato T. Ojima Y. Chen L.-C. Nagase H. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13598-13601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membranes (10 μg of protein) prepared from the ConA (10 μg/ml)-treated rabbit fibroblasts were incubated with or without 50 μg of human MT1-MMP mAb in a total volume of 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min and then reacted with purified human pro-MMP-2 (30 ng) at 37 °C for 24 h as described previously (40Ito A. Yamada M. Sato T. Sanekata K. Sato H. Seiki M. Nagase H. Mori Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To monitor pro-MMP-2 processing, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the resultant supernatant (10 μl) was subjected to gelatin zymography as described above. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene Co., Toyama, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated RNA (15 μg) was denatured and electrophoresed on 1.0% (w/v) formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel and then transferred onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen; NEN Life Science Products). The membrane was hybridized with a32P-labeled MT1-MMP or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (40Ito A. Yamada M. Sato T. Sanekata K. Sato H. Seiki M. Nagase H. Mori Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A total of 3 μg of isolated RNA was subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis with Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, RNase inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. One-tenth of the cDNA generated from the reverse transcriptase reaction was used for PCR amplification in the presence of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and oligonucleotide primers, 5′-CAG ATC TTC GGG GAC TAT TAC CAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCT GTT GTC ATT CAT CTG TGT GTA CC-3′ (antisense). The sense and antisense primers were designed corresponding to human furin cDNA (391–414 and 770–795 bp, respectively), since furin is substantially conserved among mammalian tissues and cell lines (21Hatsuzawa K. Hosaka M. Nakagawa T. Nagase M. Shoda A. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Van den Ouweland A.M.W. Van Duijnhoven H.L.P. Keizer G.D. Dorssers C.J. Van de Ven W.J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 664Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The amplification was performed at 92 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s after initial denaturation at 92 °C for 2 min. We also confirmed that the PCR product was lineally produced between 35 and 40 cycles. The amplified PCR product (405 bp) was analyzed with 1% (w/v) agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The 405-bp PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and then the cDNA sequence was confirmed with a Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Intracellular furin activity was measured with a furin-specific substrate,t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-RVKR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (MCA) (41Hatsuzawa K. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell lysate (20 μg of protein) prepared as described above was incubated with 1.5 μm Boc-RVKR-MCA in a 96-well plate for 6 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 mm ZnCl2, and then the fluorescence was measured by excitation at 365 nm and emission at 450 nm. The intracellular furin activity was calculated from a standard curve made with authentic MCA (0.125–2 μm). The specificity of the furin activity measured was estimated by comparing it with that of a poor furin substrate, Boc-LKR-MCA (42Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by Student'st test; p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. When rabbit dermal fibroblasts were treated with ConA (10 μg/ml), a spontaneously produced 72-kDa pro-MMP-2 was converted to a 62-kDa active MMP-2 with the appearance of a 64-kDa intermediate form (Fig. 1 A). The production of MT1-MMP was also augmented by ConA, whereas the enzyme was not detected in untreated rabbit fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B). The molecular weight of MT1-MMP detected in rabbit dermal fibroblasts was the same as that of human MT1-MMP expressed in ConA-treated human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells and normal human fibroblasts (data not shown). In addition, the augmented MT1-MMP production resulted from increasing its steady-state mRNA expression in ConA-treated rabbit fibroblasts (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that ConA increases pro-MMP-2 activation by augmenting the production of MT1-MMP in rabbit dermal fibroblasts and further that rabbit MT1-MMP may be expressed as an active form on the cell surface. To clarify whether the immunoreactive rabbit MT1-MMP was able to activate pro-MMP-2, an in vitro pro-MMP-2 activation experiment was performed with the membrane fraction prepared from the ConA-treated rabbit dermal fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 2, when the purified human pro-MMP-2 was incubated with plasma membranes from rabbit fibroblasts, pro-MMP-2 activation was increased with the appearance of 64-kDa intermediate and 62-kDa active forms (lanes 1 and 2). In addition, the plasma membrane-induced pro-MMP-2 activation was almost completely inhibited in the presence of human MT1-MMP mAb, and the level of 72-kDa pro-MMP-2 increased (lanes 2 and 3), indicating that the rabbit MT1-MMP functions as an activator of pro-MMP-2. Since MT1-MMP contains a furin recognition sequence RRKR in the propeptide (9Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar, 19Sato H. Kinoshita T. Takino T. Nakayama K. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the gene expression of furin was modified by ConA together with MT1-MMP production. The semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that furin mRNA was constitutively expressed in rabbit dermal fibroblasts, and the transcript level was barely changed by ConA (10 μg/ml) (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were observed in human uterine cervical fibroblasts, which are characterized as MT1-MMP-producing cells when treated with ConA (40Ito A. Yamada M. Sato T. Sanekata K. Sato H. Seiki M. Nagase H. Mori Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, sequence analysis revealed that the amplified 405-bp cDNA in both cells was exactly the same as the human furin sequence (36Van den Ouweland A.M.W. Van Duijnhoven H.L.P. Keizer G.D. Dorssers C.J. Van de Ven W.J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 664Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results suggest that rabbit furin is at least partially identical to human furin and that the gene expression is not influenced by ConA. To support further the fact that furin expression is not influenced by ConA in rabbit or human fibroblasts, we measured intracellular furin activity with a furin-specific synthetic substrate, Boc-RVRR-MCA (41Hatsuzawa K. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,42Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, furin activity was constitutively detected in both rabbit dermal and human uterine cervical fibroblasts, and the enzymic activity in the rabbit fibroblasts was relatively weaker than that in the human fibroblasts. In addition, like furin gene expression, the intracellular furin activity was almost unchanged by ConA (10 μg/ml) in both types of fibroblasts, and furin activity could no longer be detected with a nonspecific furin substrate, Boc-LKR-MCA (42Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Furthermore, we confirmed that the furin activities in both rabbit and human fibroblasts were inhibited by high concentrations of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (10–20 mm), EDTA (5 mm), and dithiothreitol (1 mm) as described previously (41Hatsuzawa K. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (data not shown), indicating that the enzymic activity detected was substantially that of furin. These results therefore suggest that furin is constitutively produced in MT1-MMP-producing cell lines, and its production is not regulated by ConA. We demonstrated that the activation of pro-MMP-2 was augmented by MT1-MMP in ConA-treated rabbit dermal fibroblasts (see Fig. 2) and human uterine cervical fibroblasts (40Ito A. Yamada M. Sato T. Sanekata K. Sato H. Seiki M. Nagase H. Mori Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, since pro-MMP-2 is one of the substrates for MT1-MMP, the monitoring of pro-MMP-2 activation is adequate to interpret whether MT1-MMP is intracellularly activated and expressed as an active form in the cultured cells. Therefore, to clarify the involvement of furin in rabbit pro-MT1-MMP activation, we investigated the effect of a furin inhibitor and an antisense oligonucleotide on the activation of pro-MMP-2. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the ConA-induced pro-MMP-2 activation was not inhibited, even when rabbit dermal fibroblasts were pretreated with a furin synthetic inhibitor, Dec-RVKR-CH2Cl, followed by the ConA (10 μg/ml) stimulation (lanes 3–5). In contrast, Dec-RVKR-CH2Cl inhibited the augmentation of pro-MMP-2 activation in the ConA-treated human uterine cervical fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner (25–100 μm) (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3–5). Similar experiments were performed with a poor furin inhibitor, Dec-RAIR-CH2Cl (100 μm), the inhibitory activity of which is 100-fold less than the specific inhibitor (35Angliker H. Wikstrom P. Shaw E. Brenner C. Fuller R.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and there was no change in the ConA-induced pro-MMP-2 activation in the human fibroblasts (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). Furthermore, another inhibitory experiment with F-AS and F-S showed that the ConA-induced pro-MMP-2 activation in rabbit dermal fibroblasts was not inhibited by F-AS (40 μm) or F-S (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4). In human uterine cervical fibroblasts, however, F-AS (40 μm) but not F-S (40 μm) interfered with the ConA-induced pro-MMP-2 activation (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and 4). To confirm further whether F-AS could specifically suppress the production of furin, we monitored the level of furin mRNA in the F-AS- and F-S-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the furin mRNA expression was completely abolished in both rabbit and human F-AS-treated fibroblasts (lane 1), but F-S did not influence the gene expression (lane 2). In addition, there was no difference in the level of rRNA stained with ethidium bromide in either F-AS- or F-S-treated cells (Fig. 6 B), indicating that F-AS specifically suppressed the expression of furin mRNA in both types of fibroblasts. These results therefore suggest that furin is substantially involved in MT1-MMP processing to activate pro-MMP-2 in human uterine cervical fibroblasts but not in rabbit dermal fibroblasts.FIG. 5Effect of furin antisense and sense oligonucleotides on MT1-MMP-mediated pro-MMP-2 activation in rabbit dermal fibroblasts and human uterine cervical fibroblasts.Confluent rabbit dermal fibroblasts (A) at the 5th passage and human uterine cervical fibroblasts (B) at the 6th passage were pretreated with the F-AS (40 μm) or the F-S (40 μm) for 6 h and then treated with ConA (10 μg/ml) in the presence of the oligonucleotides for a further 18 h.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) also reported that ConA stimulates rat fibroblasts to augment the production of MT1-MMP and the activation of pro-MMP-2. In the present study, we confirmed that ConA augmented the gene expression and production of MT1-MMP and the subsequent pro-MMP-2 activation in rabbit dermal fibroblasts (Fig. 1). It is therefore likely that MT1-MMP production and pro-MMP-2 activation increased by ConA are commonly observed in various cell species and origins. Human MT1-MMP mAb and cDNA recognized rabbit MT1-MMP protein and mRNA, respectively (Fig. 1). It is therefore of interest whether the rabbit MT1-MMP recognized by human MT1-MMP mAb would functionally participate in pro-MMP-2 activation. From this point of view, we demonstrated that in vitro pro-MMP-2 activation induced by plasma membranes from ConA-treated rabbit dermal fibroblasts was effectively inhibited by exogenously adding human MT1-MMP mAb (Fig. 2). A similar inhibitory effect of MT1-MMP mAb was observed in the case of the membrane fraction from the ConA-treated human uterine cervical fibroblasts (40Ito A. Yamada M. Sato T. Sanekata K. Sato H. Seiki M. Nagase H. Mori Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, rabbit MT1-MMP cDNA was recently characterized in rabbit osteoclasts (30Sato T. Ovejero M.C. Hou P. Heegaard A.-M. Kumegawa M. Foged N.T. Delaisse J.-M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 589-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and arterial smooth muscle cells (31Wang H. Keiser J.A. J. Vasc. Res. 1998; 35: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the deduced amino acid sequence shows 96% identity to human MT1-MMP, but only 57, 52, and 38% identity to human MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, and MT4-MMP, respectively. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that rabbit MT1-MMP is functionally identical to human MT1-MMP in its pro-MMP-2 activation. Since the propeptide of pro-MT1-MMP contains RRKR which is a recognition sequence of the intracellular processing enzyme furin, it is considered that the activation of proMT1-MMP by furin is automatically accomplished in the trans-Golgi network (9Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar, 19Sato H. Kinoshita T. Takino T. Nakayama K. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Our results showed that furin mRNA and its enzymic activity were detected in both rabbit dermal and human uterine cervical fibroblasts (Fig. 3). Furthermore, neither furin mRNA expression nor its intracellular activity was altered by ConA in both fibroblast types (Fig. 3). Santavicca et al. (47Santavicca M. Noel A. Angliker H. Stoll I. Segain J.-P. Anglard P. Chretien M. Seidah N. Basset P. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) reported that the gene expression of furin in human diploid HFL1 fibroblasts is not regulated by phorbol ester, which is an inducer of MT1-MMP production in human fibroblasts and human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells (48Strongin A.Y.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that, unlike MT1-MMP production, the furin gene expression and intracellular activity cannot be substantially regulated by stimuli such as ConA and phorbol ester. Mouse and human furin cDNAs have been cloned, and the homologies of their cDNA and amino acid sequences are 96 and 94%, respectively (21Hatsuzawa K. Hosaka M. Nakagawa T. Nagase M. Shoda A.

We demonstrated that furin cDNA (405 bp) amplified in rabbit dermal fibroblasts was the same as the cDNA sequence of human furin (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the furin gene might be conserved over cell species. Furthermore, this is the first evidence that rabbit furin cDNA is identical to human furin, at least partially. It has been reported that a specific furin inhibitor, Dec-RVKR-CH2Cl, inhibits the activation of human pro-MMP-11 (47Santavicca M. Noel A. Angliker H. Stoll I. Segain J.-P. Anglard P. Chretien M. Seidah N. Basset P. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and pro-MT1-MMP (50Maquoi E. Noël A. Frankenne F. Angliker H. Murphy G. Foidart J.-M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the ConA-induced pro-MMP-2 activation in human uterine cervical fibroblasts was inhibited by Dec-RVKR-CH2Cl but not by the nonspecific furin inhibitor Dec-RAIR-CH2Cl (Fig. 4 B). In addition, F-AS but not F-S inhibited the ConA-induced pro-MMP-2 activation in the human fibroblasts (Fig. 5 B). Our results coincided with previous reports indicating that human MT1-MMP processing is mediated by furin. In contrast, neither the specific furin inhibitor nor F-AS inhibited the MT1-MMP-mediated pro-MMP-2 activation in ConA-treated rabbit dermal fibroblasts (Figs. 4 A and 5 A) regardless of whether a furin recognition sequence RRKR was contained in the propeptide of rabbit MT1-MMP (30Sato T.

Res. 1998; 35: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that F-AS specifically and completely suppressed the expression of furin mRNA in both rabbit and human fibroblasts (Fig. 6). These results strongly suggest that furin is not required for the intracellular processing of MT1-MMP in rabbit dermal fibroblasts, and therefore the involvement of furin in MT1-MMP activation may be dependent on the animal species. Furin belongs to the family of subtilisin/Kex 2p-like proprotein convertases, and six distinct convertases (PC2, PC1/PC3, PACE4, PC4, PC5/PC6, and LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7) in this family have been identified in mammalian species. It has also been reported that furin, PACE4, PC/5PC6, and LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7 are expressed in a broad range of tissues and cell lines (for review, see Ref. 51Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression patterns of these convertases are different in some physiological conditions such as embryogenesis and gestation (52Marcinkiewicz M. Day R. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4922-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 53Marcinkiewicz M. Ramla D. Seidah N.G. Chretien M.

In the present study, our finding that furin is not required for MT1-MMP activation in rabbit dermal fibroblasts regardless of the detectable enzymic activity suggests that other subtilisin/Kex 2p-like convertases may be involved in rabbit MT1-MMP activation. This hypothesis can be supported by previous studies. Other convertases such as PACE4, PC5/PC6, and LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7 have been shown to possess enzymic properties similar to those of furin (51Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Santavicca et al. (47Santavicca M. Noel A. Angliker H. Stoll I. Segain J.-P. Anglard P. Chretien M. Seidah N. Basset P. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) also reported that the activation of human pro-MMP-11 is mediated specifically by furin, but mouse pro-MMP-11 activation is accomplished by both furin and PACE4. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that in both rabbit and human fibroblasts ConA increased MT1-MMP production and thereby augmented pro-MMP-2 activation, whereas the furin gene and its enzymic activity was constitutively expressed and not influenced by ConA. Furthermore, the increased pro-MMP-2 activation was specifically inhibited by the synthetic furin inhibitor and F-AS in the ConA-treated human fibroblasts but not in rabbit fibroblasts. These results suggest a cell type-specific involvement of furin in the process of MT1-MMP activation."

To determine whether these two Ras-activating mechanisms modulate distinct biological effects, a NO-nonresponsive Ras mutant (RasC118S) was stably expressed in the PC12 cells, a cell line that generates NO upon nerve growth factor treatment. We report here that RasC118S functions indistinguishably from wild type Ras in activating and maintaining the mSOS1- and Raf-1-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade necessary for neuronal differentiation. However, continuous (>5 days) exposure to nerve growth factor reveals that, in contrast to parental or wild-type Ras-overexpressing PC12 cells, RasC118S-expressing PC12 cells cannot sustain the basal interaction between Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. This results in spontaneous apoptosis of these cells despite the presence of nerve growth factor and serum. Thus unique downstream effector interactions and biological outcomes can be differentially modulated by distinct modes of Ras activation. p21c-Ha-Ras (Ras) can be activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor mSOS1 or byS-nitrosylation of cysteine 118 via nitric oxide (NO).

Its primary function is to relay extracellular inputs from various growth factors to distinct intracellular signaling pathways, leading to long term biological outcomes unique to each stimulus and cell type. In the nerve growth factor (NGF)1-responsive cell line PC12, the molecular cascade of Ras activation via the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) mSOS1 and the downstream biological effects have been described in some detail (3Lewin G.R. Barde Y.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar, 4Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Opin.

Specifically, NGF maintains the survival of serum-deprived PC12 cells (6Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and induces the progressive differentiation of these cells into a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype (7Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar) via activation of the NGF receptor Trk A (8Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Activated Trk A recruits several signal-transducing molecules that include components of the mSOS1-Ras-MAP kinase cascade and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (4Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 5Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Although an indispensable role for Ras in mediating NGF-promoted neuronal differentiation and survival has been convincingly demonstrated using function blocking anti-Ras antibodies as well as by dominant negative or constitutively active Ras mutants (9Noda M. Ko M. Ogura A. Liu D.G. Amano T. Takano T. Ikawa Y. Nature. 1985; 318: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 10Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the time course of mSOS1-dependent Ras activation in fact exhibits a profile of activation lasting 4–5 h followed by a gradual decline in activity to near-basal level within 24 h (13Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The latter observation contrasts with the finding that NGF is required at all times to provide long term trophic support and to maintain neuronal PC12 cells in a differentiated state (6Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The temporal dichotomy between the transient initial signaling events and chronic NGF dependence raises the possibility that alternative mechanisms might exist to maintain Ras activation necessary for long term NGF responsiveness. Initially identified as an endothelial cell relaxing factor, nitric oxide (NO) has since been demonstrated to mediate a variety of cellular functions in the nervous system as well as in non-neuronal tissues (14Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar,15Nelson R.J. Kriegsfeld L.J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Front Neuroendocrinol. 1997; 18: 463-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Protein targets whose activities are altered by NO, including the NMDA receptor (16Lipton S.A. Choi Y.B. Pan Z.H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.S. Sucher N.J. Loscalzo J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar), JAK2 (17Duhe R.J. Evans G.A. Erwin R.A. Kirken R.A. Cox G.W. Farrar W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and caspase-3 (18Kim Y.M. Kim T.H. Seol D.W. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31437-31441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), are diverse regulators of cellular homeostasis. Using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry, we have previously shown that NO directly interacts with and activates Ras via S-nitrosylation on a single cysteine (Cys-118) residue (19Lander H.M. Milbank A.J. Tauras J.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Schwartz G.D. Kraemer R.T. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Burk S.C. Quilliam L.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Additional findings suggest that NO-activated Ras can recruit the downstream effectors Raf-1 and PI 3-kinase, independent of mSOS1-Ras binding (20Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because the interaction between mSOS1 and Ras can be rapidly down-regulated by an ERK-dependent negative feedback (21Buday L. Warne P.H. Downward J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1327-1331PubMed Google Scholar, 22Corbalan-Garcia S. Yang S.S. Degenhardt K.R. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), NO-mediated Ras activation might be a physiological mechanism for maintaining Ras function in specific cell types that synthesize NO in response to growth factor treatment. Of particular relevance to the present work, neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells is accompanied by up-regulation of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), leading to sustained NO release (23Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar,24Poluha W. Schonhoff C.M. Harrington K.S. Lachyankar M.B. Crosbie N.E. Bulseco D.A. Ross A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24002-24007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Using this NGF-responsive cellular paradigm, we show here that long term neuronal survival, but not differentiation, requires the activation of Ras by NO. RasWtPC12 or RasC118SPC12 cells were generated from parental PC12 cells by transfection with either the c-Ha-Ras or RasC118Sencoding cDNA subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 as described previously (25Teng K.K. Lander H. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20677-20685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). G418-resistant PC12 subclones expressing RasWt or RasC118S protein were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 400 μg of G418/ml/5% horse serum/10% calf serum. For neuronal differentiation and cell death measurements, cells were plated at low densities (e.g. 5 × 105 cells/35-mm collagen-coated dish) in 2% calf serum and 1% horse serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse 2.5 S NGF (Harlan Bioproducts for Science). For other experiments, cells were plated at higher densities (e.g. 1 × 106 cells per 35-mm collagen-coated dish), providing adequate material for biochemical analysis. Higher serum concentrations in the culture medium or 2–3-fold variation in plating density did not significantly affect the death of NGF-treated RasC118SPC12 cells. 2K. K. Teng, unpublished observation. Equal amounts of protein (2.0 mg) from detergent lysates were immunoprecipitated with either agarose-conjugated anti-Ras antibody Y13–238 or Y13–259 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, used at 15 μl/sample), followed by Western immunoblotting analysis using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (20Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The Y13–238 antibody was utilized for demonstrating mSOS1 and Raf-1 co-immunoprecipitation with Ras. Although the Y13–259 antibody has been reported to prevent complex formation between activated Ras and PI 3-kinase (26Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar), this antibody does not appear to disrupt preformed Ras-PI 3-kinase complexes (20Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Control experiments, however, confirmed that Y13–259 does disrupt pre-formed Ras-Raf-1 complexes.2 For Western blotting analysis, the following commerically available antibodies were used: polyclonal anti-Raf-1, anti-mSOS1, and anti-p110β antisera were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-Ras monoclonal antibody AB-2 was from Oncogene Research Products, and the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies PY20 and 4G10 were from Transduction Laboratory and UBI, respectively. All antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution except PY20 and 4G10, which were used at 1:5000 dilution. For PI 3-kinase assay, equal amounts (1.5 mg) of detergent lysates were immunoprecipitated with either the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (used at 4 μl/sample) or the agarose-conjugated anti-Ras antibody Y13–259 as described (27Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer (27Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), once with 0.5 mLiCl, 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, once with 0.5% Triton X-100, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and once with distilled water before the kinase assay. MAP kinase assays were performed from detergent lysates immunoprecipitated with a mixture of anti-ERK1 and ERK2 antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, both used at 2 μl/sample) as described (25Teng K.K. Lander H. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20677-20685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using [γ-32P] ATP and myelin basic protein as a substrate. The results for both MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase assays were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Additional standard biochemical procedures were followed as referenced. We generated PC12 cell lines that stably express a Ras mutant protein in which the cysteine at position 118 has been mutated to serine (RasC118S, Fig. 1 A), a point mutation that renders this molecule nonresponsive to NO (19Lander H.M. Milbank A.J. Tauras J.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Schwartz G.D. Kraemer R.T. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Burk S.C. Quilliam L.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). As a control, PC12 cells that stably express the wild type c-Ha-Ras (RasWt) at comparable levels were also generated. Expression of RasC118S and RasWt at significant levels (7–10-fold more than endogenous Ras) in each of the PC12 transfectants (referred to as RasC118SPC12 and RasWtPC12 cells, respectively) per se did not affect proliferation or overall viability. Because the mSOS1-dependent pathway for Ras activation is a critical early event in NGF signaling (4Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 5Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), we first examined whether RasC118S expression might perturb such an interaction. Western blot analysis of anti-Ras immunoprecipitates revealed that overexpression of either RasWt and RasC118Sleads to enhanced co-immunoprecipitation with endogenous mSOS1 (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, using GTP loading assay as a measurement of Ras activation (Fig. 1 C), RasC118S was found to be activated by NGF to an extent comparable with RasWt. These data indicate that, in contrast to other Ras mutants that interfere with guanine nucleotide exchange (28Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the C118S mutation in Ras does not affect the interaction with upstream GEFs necessary for its activation. Consistent with this interpretation, a prior in vitro study has concluded that Cys-118 is not a critical residue for basal GDP-GTP exchange (28Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 29Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3640-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Next, the integrity of early NGF-induced signaling cascade in RasC118S-expressing PC12 cells was examined. As anticipated, signaling components that lie upstream of Ras are not altered by RasWt or RasC118S expression whereas the NGF induced activation of the downstream MAP kinase cascade is enhanced in both RasWtPC12 and RasC118SPC12 cells. Time course comparison of NGF-triggered signaling events by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting analysis revealed comparable kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc (30Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) (e.g.52-kDa Shc) with augmented activation of the MAP kinases in both the RasWt-and RasC118S-expressing PC12 cells (Fig. 1 D). Immunoprecipitation-MAP kinase assay also confirmed a 2-fold enhancement of NGF-activated MAP kinase activity in both the RasWtPC12 and RasC118SPC12 cells when compared with that in the parental PC12 cells (data not shown). However, the observation that mutation of Cys-118 to Ser in Ras abrogates NO responsiveness in vitro (19Lander H.M. Milbank A.J. Tauras J.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Schwartz G.D. Kraemer R.T. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Burk S.C. Quilliam L.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) suggests that RasC118S might be a null mutant specific for NO-induced activation in intact cells (20Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To address this hypothesis, we measured total cellular Ras activity in RasWtPC12 and RasC118SPC12 cells treated with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The analysis was performed in cells that have been pretreated with NGF for 7 days because (i) PC12 cells synthesize NO only upon long term NGF-induced neuronal differentiation (23Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 24Poluha W. Schonhoff C.M. Harrington K.S. Lachyankar M.B. Crosbie N.E. Bulseco D.A. Ross A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24002-24007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and (ii) nitrosylation of protein targets can be modulated by intracellular redox status (31Aleryani S. Milo E. Rose Y. Kostka P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6041-6045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which is altered after NGF treatment (32Pan Z. Perez-Polo R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 E, 15 min of SNP treatment leads to an approximately 40% increase in basal Ras activity in PC12 cells that overexpressed RasWt. In contrast, RasC118SPC12 cells are not responsive to exogenous NO, even though comparable NGF-induced Ras activation (>4-fold over basal level) can be achieved via the mSOS1-dependent mechanism (Fig. 1, B andC). In the absence of NGF, both RasWt- and RasC118S-expressing PC12 cells display an undifferentiated phenotype with occasional short cytoplasmic extensions of less than one cell body diameter in length. Upon NGF treatment, RasC118SPC12 cells undergo morphological differentiation with neurite extension that is characteristic of parental PC12 cells (7Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). However, in support of a role for the Ras-MAP kinase pathway in mediating the differentiative action of NGF, both RasWtPC12 and RasC118SPC12 cells exhibit enhanced neuritogenic responsiveness to NGF (Fig. 2 C). Together these results and those obtained from additional independently generated Ras-expressing cell lines establish that RasC118S functions indistinguishably from RasWt in augmenting the well characterized signaling events that are pertinent to neuronal differentiation (4Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 5Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). When treated for prolonged periods with NGF (>5 days), however, the RasC118S-expressing PC12 cells begin to degenerate and exhibit morphological signs of cell death where phase-dark cell bodies and pyknotic nuclei are frequently observed and pre-existing neurites have degenerated (Fig. 2 A). In addition, chromatin condensation (Fig. 2 B; Hoechst 33258 staining) and DNA strand breaks (Fig. 2 D; TdT-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) analysis) are apparent in dying RasC118SPC12 cells, indicating that this form of cell death is apoptotic (33Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). At all time points examined, comparably treated parental PC12 or RasWtPC12 cells appeared healthy with intact nuclei and extensive neurite networks. A comparison between the time course of neurite initiation (Fig. 2 C) with the onset of cell death (Fig. 2 D) further suggests that neuronal differentiation precedes RasC118SPC12 cell apoptosis. Consistent with this interpretation, long term treatment (>7 days) of RasC118SPC12 cells with basic fibroblast growth factor, which induces neuronal differentiation (34Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3639-3653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but not the mitogenic epidermal growth factor (35Mutoh T. Rudkin B.B. Koizumi S. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15853-15856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also results in apoptotic cell death (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that long term NGF treatment of PC12 cells leads to the up-regulation of NOS activity with kinetics that are tightly coupled to the onset of neuronal differentiation (23Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Using cellular diaphorase staining, which is a histochemical marker for NOS-positive neurons (36Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Fotuhi M. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7797-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar), and PC12 cells (23Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 24Poluha W. Schonhoff C.M. Harrington K.S. Lachyankar M.B. Crosbie N.E. Bulseco D.A. Ross A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24002-24007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we confirmed this observation in PC12 cells and found that NOS activity is not inhibited by RasWt or RasC118S expression (data not shown). Because the only detectable difference between RasWt and RasC118S is that the latter cannot be activated by NO, we postulated that high levels of RasC118Sexpression may interfere with endogenous NO-responsive Ras to modulate downstream signaling pathways that are critical for survival (26Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 33Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J.

Apoptosis of a variety of cell types, including PC12 cells, has been causally linked to the down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic MAP kinase ERK (33Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar) and PI 3-kinase (38Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both kinases are downstream targets of Ras (26Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 37Warne P.H. Viciana P.R. Downward J. Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). To assess whether the coupling of either effector to Ras is impaired by RasC118S expression, we first compared the Ras-Raf-1 interaction and activity of MAP kinases in long term (≥7 days) NGF-treated RasC118SPC12 and RasWtPC12 cells. However, no detectable differences were observed between these two cell types as both display comparable Ras-Raf-1 interaction (Fig. 3 A) and MAP kinase activation (Fig. 3 B). Significantly, dying RasC118SPC12 cells continue to exhibit enhanced Raf-1-mediated MAP kinase activation when compared with parental PC12 cells (Fig. 3, A andB). Although PI 3-kinase can be activated by binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences and by direct interaction with Ras (39Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), the relative contribution of these two activation pathways on PI 3-kinase in long term NGF-treated PC12 cells has not been examined. We found that, in contrast to the Ras-Raf-1 interaction (Fig. 3 A), RasWt overexpression does not result in increased p110β binding or PI 3-kinase activation (when compared with the parental PC12 cells; Fig. 3, C and D). This suggests that additional mechanism(s) might limit the extent of Ras-dependent PI 3-kinase activation in neuronal PC12 cells (see “Discussion” below). Most importantly, however, immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis reveals that although comparable PI 3-kinase p110β subunit expression was present in all three cell types and in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates, RasC118S fails to interact with PI 3-kinase in long term NGF-treated RasC118SPC12 cells (Fig. 3 C). Consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation results, we also found a significant decline (>50%) in Ras-associated PI 3-kinase activity in long term NGF-treated RasC118SPC12 cells whereas the kinase activity in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates remains unaffected (Fig. 3 D). Together the above findings establish that expression of the RasC118S mutant protein may cause apoptosis of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells by affecting the Ras-PI 3-kinase pathway critical for cell survival (26Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 38Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 40Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RasC118S does not interfere with, and in fact enhances, the cascade of differentiative signaling events and is “pro-apoptotic” only after PC12 cells have acquired a neuronal phenotype. The observation that expression of either RasWt or the RasC118S leads to augmented MAP kinase activation suggests that maintaining MAP kinase activity in neuronal PC12 cells is a GEF-dependent, but NO-independent, process. In contrast, the specific decrease in Ras-mediated PI 3-kinase activation and RasC118SPC12 cell death is particularly significant and implicates a causal relationship (20Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 38Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a model in which NGF evokes at least two distinct mechanisms for Ras activation culminating in unique biochemical and biological outputs: the well characterized mSOS1-Ras-Raf-1 pathway required for differentiative signaling (4Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 5Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) and the latent NO-mediated Ras-PI 3-kinase cascade regulating cell survival. It has been reported that optimal PI 3-kinase activation by Ras occurs when the p85α subunit-binding phosphotyrosine peptide is present at suboptimal concentrations (39Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Therefore, at a time when most early NGF-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation events have returned to near basal levels (i.e. in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells), the NO-Ras interaction may be the predominant activating mechanism for PI 3-kinase. Currently we do not fully understand how NO synthesis is coupled to endogenous Ras-PI 3-kinase activation, or conversely, how ectopic expression of RasC118S interferes with this process. However, several potential models merit consideration. First, RasC118S might behave as an effector site mutant specifically impaired in PI 3-kinase binding (41Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), but available information on Ras-effector interaction, which emphasizes residues flanking the switch I region of Ras (41Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 42Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), argues against this possibility. Second, because NO (or other higher reactive nitrogen species) exists as short-lived free radical (43Stamler J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 196: 19-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), a scaffolding molecule, such as caveolin (44Garcia-Cardena G. Martasek P. Masters B.S. Skidd P.M. Couet J. Li S. Lisanti M.P. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25437-25440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 45Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), might sequester NOS and Ras within physical proximity for efficient signal transduction. Recently, a multidomain Ras-binding protein SUR-8/SOC-2 has been identified inCaenorhabditis elegans that serves to modulate the Raf-1 signaling (46Therrien M. Wong A.M. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although speculative at present, it is conceivable that SUR-8/SOC-2 or other similar Ras-binding proteins might also enhance PI 3-kinase activity. High levels of RasC118S expression would terminate NO signaling by displacing endogenous Ras from either the “scaffold” or the “enhancer,” thereby conferring the observed dominant inhibitory phenotype on PI 3-kinase activation. Limited expression of such a molecule(s) would also explain why RasWt overexpression does not further activate PI 3-kinase (Fig. 3, C andD). Experiments are in progress to specifically address these possibilities. In summary we have identified a novel mechanism for maintaining distinct cellular responses via a common signaling intermediate. It has been proposed that, similar to phosphorylation, protein nitrosylation is a sequence-specific, reversible, covalent modification event (47Stamler J.S. Tooner E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Although nitrosothiol formation is suggested here to play a critical role in sustaining neuronal PC12 cell survival via PI 3-kinase, NO-dependent modulation of Ras functions can be extended to non-neuronal paradigms (48Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and might activate the Raf-1-MAP kinase pathway instead (20Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 49Yun H.Y. Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our prior study has demonstrated that Ras can also be activated by reactive oxygen species (48Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ras activation might be modulated by a stimulus (e.g.platelet-derived growth factor) or pathway (e.g. activated Rac) that generates reactive oxygen intermediates (50Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar, 51Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the Cys-118 on Ras, although dispensable for GEF binding (28Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (this study), is conserved within subfamily members of the Ras GTPase superfamily. Thus molecules such as Rap1 and Rab3 might be subjected to analogous modification with unique downstream consequences. A future research challenge will be to assign the pleiotropic effects of free radical signaling to individual small GTPases. We thank Sharon Campbell for the RasWt and RasC118S cDNA and Moses Chao and Patrizia Casaccia-Bonnefil for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2139203950,"Designing altered peptide ligands to generate specific immunological reactivity when bound to class I major histocompatibility complexes is important for both therapeutic and prophylactic reasons. We have previously shown that two altered peptides, derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-reverse transcriptase (RT) residues 309–317, are more immunogenic in vitro than the wild-type peptide. One peptide variant, I1Y, was able to stimulate RT-specific cytotoxic T cells from the blood of three HIV-infected individuals better than the wild-type RT peptide. Both I1Y and I1F peptide variants increase the cell surface half-life of the peptide-class I complex approximately 3-fold over that of the RT peptide but have different immunological activities. These peptides are candidates for the design of vaccines for HIV due to their increased immunogenicity. To understand the basis for the increased cell surface stability compared with wild-type peptide and to understand the differences in T cell recognition between I1Y and I1F, we determined the x-ray crystal structures of the two class I MHC-peptide complexes. These structures indicate that the increased cell surface half-life is due to π-π stacking interactions between Trp-167 of HLA-A2.1 and the aromatic P1 residues of I1F and I1Y. Comparison of the structures and modeling potential T cell receptor (TCR) interactions suggests that T cell interactions and immunogenicity are different between I1Y and I1F for two reasons. First, subtle changes in the steric and polar properties of the I1Y peptide affect TCR engagement.

T cell receptor reverse transcriptase major histocompatibility complex human immunodeficiency virus cytotoxic T lymphocytes peripheral blood lymphocytes 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid non-crystallographic-symmetry root mean square The cytolytic immune response is a major component of the body's defense against viral infection (1Doherty P.C. Allan W. Eichelberger M. Carding S.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 123-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This response is mediated by the interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR)1 on CD8+cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (2Zinkernagel R.M. Doherty P.C. Nature. 1974; 248: 701-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Control of viral infections such as HIV requires a vigorous CTL response (3Schmitz J.E. Kuroda M.J. Santra S. Sasseville V.G. Simon M.A. Lifton M.A. Racz P. Tenner-Racz K. Dalesandro M. Scallon B.J. Ghrayeb J. Forman M.A. Montefiori D.C. Rieber E.P. Letvin N.L. Reimann K.A. Science. 1999; 283: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Class I MHC molecules are trimolecular complexes consisting of an allotype-specific heavy chain, a light chain β2-microglobulin, and an endogenously processed peptide. The antigenic peptide typically binds with the termini buried in the peptide-binding cleft. The middle of the peptide frequently bulges out of the peptide-binding cleft. Bulging in the center makes these residues more accessible to the TCR and as such these residues are usually critical for TCR recognition (see Ref. 4Batalia M.A. Collins E.J. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 281-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). Class I MHC molecules are capable of binding a diverse set of peptides with long half-lives. A major component of the binding energy is derived from interactions between conserved residues in the peptide-binding cleft and the invariant peptidic termini (5Madden D.R. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 693-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Additionally, peptides that bind with high affinity typically have two or more relatively invariant residues, termed anchors, that bind in specificity pockets primarily composed of class I heavy chain polymorphic residues (6Jardetzky T.S. Lane W.S. Robinson R.A. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 7Hunt D.F. Henderson R.A. Shabanowitz J. Sakaguchi K. Michel H. Sevilir N.

Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). Other positions in the peptide can also make significant contributions to peptide-MHC affinity (9Ruppert J. Sidney J. Celis E. Kubo R.T. Grey H.M. Sette A. Cell. 1993; 74: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Previously, we identified two aromatic single amino acid substitutions at the amino-terminal end (P1 position, normally isoleucine) of the HLA-A2.1 (A2)-restricted HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) peptide-(309–317) (ILKEPVHGV) that increase the cell surface half-lives of complexes 3-fold over the A2/RT-peptide complex. These two peptides, designated I1F and I1Y, also show increased immunogenicity compared with the wild-type RT. In vitroexperiments with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from three different HIV-positive patients show that in vitro expansion of CTL using I1Y-pulsed antigen-presenting cells stimulates a higher CTL response against wild-type RT-pulsed target cells than in vitro expansion with the RT peptide itself. In contrast, I1F-pulsed cells stimulate a higher response against RT-pulsed cells in only one of the two sets of donor PBLs that were tested. The I1F and I1Y peptides also differ in their ability to be recognized by RT-specific CTL lines (10Pogue R.R. Eron J. Frelinger J.A. Matsui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8166-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To understand better why the I1Y, I1F, and RT peptides have differing immunological properties, we determined the x-ray crystal structures of A2 complexed with I1Y and I1F peptides to 2.2 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively. Comparison of these structures with the previously determined RT structure (5Madden D.R. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 693-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), along with modeling the interactions of the A6 and B7 TCRs (11Garboczi D.N. Ghosh P. Utz U. Fan Q.R. Biddison W.E.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) with the three A2 structures, has given us insight into the differing immunological properties. The crystallographic structures suggest that the increases in cell surface half-life are due to interactions between the aromatic P1 residues (Tyr and Phe) and tryptophan-167 of A2. Pseudo homology models of TCR and these class I MHC complexes suggest that the differences in T cell recognition between the I1Y and I1F complexes may be attributed to two subtle structural differences due specifically to the hydroxyl group of P1-tyrosine. All peptides were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Facility at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The sequences of the peptides are ILKEPVHGV (wild-type RT), YLKEPVHGV (I1Y), and FLKEPVHGV (I1F). All peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography to greater than 95% purity, and the sequences were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight spectrometry. A2/I1Y and A2/I1F complexes were folded by rapid dilution in vitro as described previously (13Garboczi D.N. Hung D.T. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3233-3429Crossref Scopus (567) Google Scholar). After incubation for 36–48 h at 10 °C, the folding solutions were concentrated in an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon; Beverly, MA) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography-gel filtration chromatography (Phenomenex, BioSep-SEC-S2000) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Purified complexes were then concentrated using Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon) and exchanged into buffers consisting of either 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, for crystallization, or 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, for circular dichroism experiments. The relative stabilities of the peptide/A2 complexes were measured by circular dichroism (CD) thermal denaturation experiments. The experiments were performed on an AVIV 62-DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. The protein concentration was approximately 10 μm in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The thermal denaturation of purified A2/RT, A2/I1Y, and A2/I1F complexes was monitored as the change in circular dichroic signal at 218 nm from 4 to 95 °C. The T m values (50% denatured) were determined by modeling the denaturation as a two-state process (14Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 265: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) from a normalized plot of the denaturation. The reportedT m is the average of three separate thermal denaturation experiments. The error associated with the reportedT m is the sum of the machine error (0.5 °C) and the error in the curve fit (∼0.5 °C). Both A2/I1Y and A2/I1F complexes were crystallized by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method. The well solution for A2/I1Y contained 18% PEG-8000 in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, and the hanging drop was a 1:1 mixture of the well solution and 10 mg/ml protein in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5. The well solution for A2/I1F contained 20% PEG-8000 in 25 mm MES, pH 6., and the hanging drop was a 1:1 mixture of the well solution and 10 mg/ml protein in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5. Microseeding was performed for both complexes to obtain large single crystals suitable for crystallographic studies. Crystals were transferred directly into cryoprotectant buffer containing 20% PEG-8000 supplemented with 25–30% glycerol in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, and placed directly into a 100 K nitrogen stream generated by an Oxford Cryo System. The A2/I1Y diffraction data were collected on beamline X-12B at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratories (Upton, NY). The A2/I1F diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku R-Axis IIC using CuKα radiation. All diffraction data were processed using the programs Denzo and Scalepack (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

As there are two molecules per asymmetric unit of each crystal, 2-fold non-crystallographic averaging coupled with solvent flattening and histogram matching (DM) (17Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) greatly improved the quality of the electron density maps. Manual model building into the electron density maps was performed using the program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Struct. Crystallogr. Cryst. Chem. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Computational refinement was performed using the programs X-PLOR version 3.851 (19Brunger A. X-PLOR, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and Refmac (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The structure was first refined in X-PLOR using 8–2.2-Å resolution data. Two-fold non-crystallographic-symmetry (NCS) restraints were applied to the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of A2/I1Y crystals with a weight of 300 kcal mol−1Å−2. Overall isotropic B factor refinement was first performed, followed by rigid body refinement using three structural domains as follows: α1/α2 (the peptide-binding superdomain), α3, and β2-microglobulin. Cycles of computational refinement were performed using positional refinement. Later cycles of refinement were performed using Refmac with “strict” NCS restraints (see Refmac manual), a bulk solvent correction, overall anisotropic B factor correction, and individual B factor refinement. 192 water molecules were added to the structure using program ARP (22Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) in CCP4 with Refmac as the refinement tool. The final R free (23Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) andR work factors (F >0) between 30 and 2.2 Å are 28.9 and 24.4%, respectively. The refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The conformations of the peptides were confirmed by the following “averaged” omit map procedure. The peptide was omitted from the refined model before calculation of the phases and structure factors used to generate the electron density map input into DM. Model masks were made using peptide to be sure that all averaging included peptide regions. Finally, model phase bias was reduced from the initial map in DM by 2-fold non-crystallographic averaging, solvent flattening, and histogram matching. Refinement of A2/I1F was performed as was A2/I1Y except Refmac was used throughout the refinement. Rigid body refinement was used to optimize the domain positions. Cycles of positional refinement were performed with strict NCS restraints (see Refmac manual), a bulk solvent correction, overall anisotropic B factor correction, and overall temperature factor refinement. Final cycles included individual temperature factor refinement. This was justified by the observation of a drop in the R free. The final R free and R workfactors (F >0) between 15 and 2.8 Å are 31.5 and 27.4%, respectively. The refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The thermal stability of class I MHC molecules, as measured by circular dichroism (CD), is proportional to the free energy of peptide binding (24Morgan C.S. Holton J.M. Olafson B.D. Bjorkman P.J. Mayo S.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1771-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We used CD thermal denaturation experiments to compare the relative thermal stability of purified A2 folded in vitro with I1Y, I1F, and RT peptides. A2/I1F and A2/I1Y complexes generated significantly higher melting temperatures (temperature at which 50% of the complexes have denatured) at 55 and 56 °C, respectively, compared with 48 °C for A2/RT (Fig. 1). Therefore, both I1F and I1Y peptides bind to A2 with higher affinity than RT. These results are consistent with the increased cell surface half-lives we have previously reported (10Pogue R.R. Eron J. Frelinger J.A. Matsui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8166-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In order to understand why they bind with higher affinity, we determined their crystal structures bound to A2. The x-ray crystal structures of the A2/I1Y and A2/I1F complexes were determined to a resolution of 2.2 and 2.8 Å, respectively. Both structures show clear, unambiguous density throughout the model. Overall, the A2/I1Y and A2/I1F structures are very similar to the RT structure (5Madden D.R. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 693-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) (r.m.s. deviations of 0.33 Å each when superpositioning the α-carbons of the peptide-binding super domains). The peptide positions are unambiguous in the density. The averaged omit maps for the I1Y and I1F peptides (see under “Materials and Methods”) are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Both the I1Y and I1F peptides bind in the cleft in a conformation similar to that of the RT peptide, as shown in Fig. 2, C andD. The I1Y and I1F peptides have r.m.s. deviations of 0.33 Å and 0.25 Å for the α-carbon backbone of the peptides alone, respectively, based on the above superimposition of the α1/α2 domains onto the A2/RT α1/α2 domains. Upon completion of the crystal structure determinations, we looked for a reason for the increased affinity of the I1F and I1Y peptides as compared with RT. As the overall structures of the complexes are identical, we examined the peptides. In general, the paths of the main chain atoms of the peptides are identical. The side chain orientations of the P1 residues of the three peptides are similar, with the side chain pointing out of the binding cleft toward the TCR (Fig. 2,C and D). The aromatic rings of phenylalanine and tyrosine of I1F and I1Y are both oriented parallel to tryptophan-167 of the A2 binding cleft at a distance of 3.5 Å, suggesting these P1 substitutions allow stabilizing π-π orbital interactions with tryptophan-167. These π-π stabilizing interactions are not possible with the isoleucine in the wild-type peptide. The interaction of the P1 residue of I1Y peptide with tryptophan-167 is shown in Fig. 3 B. Next, we asked why T cell recognition is increased for the A2/I1F and A2/I1Y complexes compared with A2/RT. Examination of the structures shows one significant topological change to the surface of the TCR contact region when compared with the A2/RT complex. The P1 side chains I1Y and I1F protrude farther out of the peptide-binding cleft. The increased size of these amino acids increases the distance that the P1 side chain protrudes from the binding cleft by 2.9 and 1.6 Å, respectively. The only other difference between the structures of the I1Y peptide and the RT peptide, besides the substitution at the first position, is at the P4 glutamate. In the A2/I1Y structure, the P4 glutamate moves 0.6 Å from the RT position toward the P1 tyrosine. The distance between the tyrosine hydroxyl and the carboxylate of the glutamate is 5.7 Å and is too long for a direct hydrogen bond. The averaged omit map shows an elongated stretch of electron density perpendicular to the peptide backbone between the P1 and P4 residues, as shown in Fig. 4. This region of density is large enough to accommodate up to three waters at various occupancies. A water molecule within this stretch of electron density would be sufficient to bridge a hydrogen bond interaction between the tyrosine and the glutamate. However, the relatively low peak heights in the electron density maps suggest that these waters are not highly occupied. The side chain nitrogen of lysine-66 in the A2 binding cleft is sufficiently close to participate in a hydrogen bond with a water molecule that lies between the P1 and P4 residue as well. Conversely, in the I1F structure the glutamate at position 4 moves 1.1 Å (relative to the RT position) toward the carboxyl-terminal end of the peptide. Thus, the overall effect is to either move the glutamate side chain toward the potential hydrogen-bonding partner at P1 (in I1Y) or away from P1 (in I1F). In order to understand the potential effects that the P1 substitutions would have on TCR recognition, we modeled the P1 residues at the TCR/class I interface. There is close similarity at P1-P2 of the Tax peptide (leucine-leucine) in the TCR-MHC co-crystal structure (11Garboczi D.N. Ghosh P. Utz U. Fan Q.R. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), both co-crystallized with A2/Tax peptide (LLFGYPVYV), provide a good model for comparing the TCR-MHC interactions between RT and I1Y/I1F. Both TCRs were modeled onto the A2/I1Y, A2/I1F, and A2/RT structures by superimposing the α1/α2 domains of our structures onto the α1/α2 domains of A2/Tax complex in each of the co-crystal structures. The r.m.s. deviations for the superimposition of the A2/TOX molecules in the A6 and B7 TCR co-crystal structures onto A2/RT were 0.50 and 0.42 Å. A model of the B7 TCR docked with A2/I1Y is shown in Fig. 3 A. Interatomic distances were calculated between the P1 peptide residue and the nearest residue of the TCR and are summarized in Table II.Table IIDistances between atoms in residues of TCR models and peptide P1 residuesAtom of Met-28RT [C(δ)]I1F [C(ζ)]I1Y [OH]A.

Distances (Å) that are below the optimal van der Waals contact distance (after factoring in coordinate error) are underlined. Open table in a new tab There are no unfavorable van der Waals contacts between the P1 isoleucine of RT and the two TCRs. However, the phenylalanine of A2/I1F, makes one significantly bad van der Waals contact with methionine 28 of the B7-TCR (2.11 Å as compared with the optimal value of 3.4 Å). All of the potential bad contacts of I1F with the A6 TCR are within experimental error. The additional hydroxyl of the tyrosine side chain (I1Y), as compared with I1F, increases the number of unfavorable van der Waals contacts to five for the B7-TCR and three for the A6-TCR. Collectively, these data suggest that the B7 and A6 TCR would not bind to these complexes because of the unfavorable van der Waals contacts brought by the larger phenylalanine and tryrosine side chains. This is not unexpected because the A6 and B7 TCR are not known to recognize A2/RT or RT-variant peptide complexes. But, these data do suggest that RT-specific TCRs could take advantage of these larger (and for I1Y, more polar) P1 side chains to increase the TCR binding affinity for the A2/I1Y and A2/I1F complexes. The design of peptides with high affinity for class I MHC to use in peptide-based vaccines requires a process of molecular “fine-tuning.” In this process, the peptide must be altered in a manner significant enough to increase the affinity of peptide for MHC, but these changes must be also be subtle enough so that the peptide-MHC complex is still recognized by the repertoire of TCRs that recognize wild-type peptide. Increases in immunogenicity may be accounted for by the following three non-exclusive mechanisms. 1) Changes to the peptide that increase the stability of the peptide-MHC complex increase the cell surface half-life of the complex. This would increase the relative concentration of the peptide-MHC complex at the cell surface and by standard equilibrium processes increase the number of engaged MHC/TCR. 2) The increased concentration of the complexes at the cell surface and association with the membrane increases the avidity of the MHC-TCR interaction. 3) Changes in the peptide directly increase the affinity (or duration of contact) of the peptide-MHC complex for TCR. In this study, we have seen examples of all of these mechanisms. We previously screened 11 different P1 substitutions of the HIV-RT peptide for the ability to increase the A2/peptide complex stability at the cell surface (10Pogue R.R. Eron J. Frelinger J.A. Matsui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8166-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). P1 substitutions were chosen in an effort to minimize alterations in T cell interactions, given that structural data suggest the majority of the P1 residue is typically buried in the binding cleft (5Madden D.R. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 693-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Two P1 substitutions, I1F and I1Y, increased the cell surface half-life of the A2/peptide complex from 10 to 30 h (10Pogue R.R. Eron J. Frelinger J.A. Matsui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8166-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). I1Y stimulated a higher CTL response against wild-type RT-pulsed target cells than the RT peptide itself. These investigations raise several structural questions regarding the differing immunological properties between A2/RT, A2/I1Y, and A2/I1F complexes. First of all, what features of the A2/I1Y and A2/I1F complexes account for the drastic increase in cell surface half-life? Second, how do we account for the difference in immunogenicity of the two peptides, given that the cell surface half-lives of the A2/I1Y and A2/I1F complexes are nearly identical? Finally, how do we account for the differences in RT-specific CTL line recognition between I1Y and I1F? To understand better the structural basis for the differing immunological properties between A2/RT, A2/I1Y, and A2/I1F complexes, we determined the x-ray crystal structures of the A2/I1Y and A2/I1F complexes at 2.2- and 2.8-Å crystallographic resolution, respectively. The 2.5-Å structure of A2/RT was described previously by Maddenet al. (5Madden D.R. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 693-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and is used for comparison with our models. Biochemically, one of the striking differences between the A2/RT and both the A2/I1Y and A2/I1F complexes is the dramatic increase in cell surface half-life. A significant feature revealed in the A2/I1Y and A2/I1F crystal structures is the parallel orientation of the aromatic P1 residues and Trp-167 at a distance of 3.5 Å, which defines the peptide amino-terminal end of the binding cleft (Fig. 3). Aromatic-aromatic interactions are a common mechanism in protein stabilization and are estimated to contribute −1 to −2 kcal/mol binding energy (25Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Science. 1985; 229: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). It is likely that this feature of the A2/I1F and A2/I1Y complexes accounts for the increased cell surface half-lives of the peptide-MHC complexes. This is consistent with the 7–8 °C increase in thermal stability observed in the CD thermal denaturation experiments with the A2/I1F and A2/I1Y complexes. The increase in cell surface half-life of the A2/I1Y complex is probably an important determinant with respect to the increased immunogenicity of A2/I1Y. The primary mechanism could be postulated to be that the increase in the concentration of the complex at the cell surface increases the potential number of class I complexes that interact with the TCR by thermodynamic mechanisms. But it cannot be the entire story. Both A2/I1Y and A2/I1F complexes have identical cell surface half-lives of 30 h (compared with 10 h for the RT complex). However, in in vitro experiments using PBLs from HIV-positive donors, the I1Y peptide was able to stimulate a higher CTL response against RT-specific target cells than RT peptide stimulation itself in three of three PBL sets tested. On the other hand, I1F stimulated a higher CTL response in the PBLs of only one of the two donors tested. Changes to the affinity and/or duration of contact between MHC-peptide and TCR must be involved. There are two potential explanations for this phenomenon. The first explanation is that all the TCRs of the T cells that respond to A2/RT have increased affinity for (or prolong contact with) A2/I1Y. It could also be that only a subset of T cells actually respond to A2/I1Y, but the TCR have higher affinity for (or prolonged contact with) A2/I1Y, and that interaction makes the subset of T cells respond better then the full set of T cells to A2/RT. Unfortunately, we cannot resolve these two possibilities because the cell lines are extinct, and the donors are deceased. Our crystallographic studies reveal that the A2/I1Y complex has two significant structural differences from the RT and I1F complexes that could affect TCR interactions. From our modeling studies with the A6 and B7 TCRs onto the A2/RT, A2/I1F, and A2/I1Y complexes, it is evident that the P1-Tyr of the bound I1Y peptide protrudes far enough out of the binding cleft to make significant unfavorable contacts with residues of the TCR (Fig. 3). However, in the T cell repertoire that reacts to RT-based peptides, it is a distinct possibility that the hydroxyl group of P1-Tyr could make additional favorable hydrogen bond interactions with the TCR that would not be permitted with a phenylalanine or isoleucine at P1. Such interactions could potentially increase the affinity or time of engagement of the TCR-MHC interaction, which could in turn enhance the T cell-mediated immune response. A second feature of the A2/I1Y complex that differentiates it from the I1F and RT complexes and may be involved in TCR interactions is the interaction between the P1-Tyr and P4-Glu. Comparison of the crystallographic structures of the A6 TCR/Tax peptide/A2 complexversus the Tax/A2 complex alone demonstrates that the middle of the Tax peptide undergoes a significant conformational change upon TCR binding (11Garboczi D.N. Ghosh P. Utz U. Fan Q.R. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). This suggests that some degree of conformational flexibility in the bound peptide may be required for engagement of the TCR by the MHC complex. The additional hydrogen bond interaction of the P4-glutamate of the I1Y peptide with the P1-Tyr should make the bound peptide more rigid than the I1F and RT peptides, a factor that could easily alter T cell recognition. For example, in the co-crystal structure of the TCR 2C and H-2Kb-dEV8, there are six contacts between four residues on the CDR3α loop with the P4 residue (26Garcia K.C. Degano M. Pease L.R. Huang M. Peterson P.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Science. 1998; 279: 1166-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In summary, our data suggest that some of the increased immunogenicity of the A2/I1Y complex is due to the increased peptide-MHC affinity afforded by the aromatic substitution at P1. At least part of the mechanism is due to increases in the concentration of cell surface peptide-MHC and involves the avidity of the MHC-peptide-TCR interaction. The modeling of the TCR contacts and the differing biological reactivity between A2/I1F and A2/I1Y suggests that the interactions between the MHC and TCR are also affected. Thus, some part of the increased immunogenicity must be due to increased affinity (or duration of contact) between the peptide-MHC and the TCR. The increases in immunological reactivity of I1Y and I1F peptides are most likely due to a combination of equilibrium mechanisms due to the increase in the density of complexes at the cell surface and thermodynamic (or kinetic) mechanisms due to the changes in the interface of MHC-peptide and TCR. As these types of changes cannot easily be anticipated, altered peptide ligands designed for immunotherapy must be carefully examined biologically to test the effects of the changes made to the peptide.

Substitution of the more basic residues resulted in enhanced thermal stability, decreased rate of nucleotide exchange, and decreased susceptibility to controlled proteolysis relative to wild-type actin. The opposite effects are observed with the neutral and anionic substitutions. All mutations reduced the rate of polymerization. Molecular dynamics simulations predict a new conformation for the His73 imidazole in the absence of a methyl group. It also predicts that Arg73 tightens and stabilizes the actin and that Glu73 causes a rearrangement of the bottom of actin's interdomain cleft leading possibly to our observed destabilization of actin. Considering the exterior location of His73, this work indicates a surprisingly important role for the residue as a major structural determinant of actin and provides a clue to the impact caused by methylation of His73.

The only exception to this rule had been the actin from Naegleria gruberii (1Sussman D.J. Sellers J.R. Flicker P. Lai E.Y. Cannon L.E. Szent-Gyorgi A.G. Fulton C. J. Biol.

The conservation of a positively charged residue at this position suggests it might be necessary to offset the high negative charge density in the vicinity which otherwise might disrupt actin structure. Previously, we demonstrated that mutation of His73 in muscle actin would not prevent the incorporation of radiolabeled mutant monomers into wild-type actin filaments in vitro (6Solomon L.R. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11382-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this case, it was entirely possible that the constraints imposed upon the mutant monomer by the WT1 monomers in the filament masked any effects that the mutation would have caused in a pure mutant filament. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, Wriggers and Schulten (7Wriggers W. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 624-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have proposed that the imidazole moiety of this histidine residue blocks the opening of a channel by which water can gain access into the interior of the actin molecule where the bound nucleotide resides (7Wriggers W. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 624-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This imidazole is over 6.5 Å away from the γ-phosphate of the bound ATP and is thus too far away to directly interact with the phosphate. However, these investigators subsequently proposed that following scission of the βγ-phosphate bond during polymerization, movement of the Pi away from the ADP toward the outside of the channel would allow it to interact with a positively charged imidazole thereby stabilizing the phosphate's negative charge. The interaction between the two moieties, promoted by protonation of the imidazole, would retard the release of the phosphate from the actin (8Wriggers W. Schulten K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since the state of the nucleotide in the filament determines filament stability (9Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7789-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7349-7354PubMed Google Scholar), this phosphate retention hypothesis, if correct, suggests that His73 might be an important factor in controlling cytoskeletal dynamics. To investigate the effect of His73 on actin function, we have mutated this residue in S. cerevisiae actin. Substitution with Arg and Lys maintains a positive charge at this position, substitution with Ala neutralizes the charge. Replacement with Glu introduces a negative charge in place of the original positive charge, and finally substitution of Gln gives a neutral substitution isosteric with Glu. We have isolated yeast cells expressing each of these as the only actin in the cell and have assessed the effects of these mutations in vivo. Prior to assessing the mutations' effects on ATP hydrolysis and Pi release in terms of the phosphate-release model, it was necessary to determine the effects of the mutations on actin monomer integrity and polymerizability. We have thus isolated the actins and characterized the effects of the mutations on monomer stability, tertiary structure, nucleotide exchange, and the ability to form filaments at different temperatures. The results of these studies are reported here. The site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene Corp. Oligodeoxynucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized in the DNA Core Facility at the University of Iowa. The Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit was purchased from Sigma. DNase I was obtained from Worthington. Affi-Gel 10 was obtained from Bio-Rad. Etheno-ATP, α-chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin were purchased from Sigma. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct a mutant actin sequence carried in a centromeric vector pRS314 (12Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) marked with the TRP1 gene. The oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-GGTTACCCAATTGAAC(G/A)A(C/G)A(T)GGTATTGTCACCAACTGG-3′ was used to generate the mutant actins in which the codon for His(CAC) was mutated to that for Ala(GCT), Gln(CAA), Glu(GAA), Lys(AAA), and Arg(CGT). The underlined sequences are the mutated codons. The DNA was sequenced in each case to verify the desired mutation. pRS314 plasmids containing the mutant coding sequences were introduced into atrp1,ura3-52 haploid cell in which the chromosomal ACT1 gene had been disrupted by replacement of the coding sequence with the LEU2 gene. Wild-type actin was expressed in these recipient cells from another centromeric plasmid containing the URA3 gene. Following transformation with the mutant plasmid and selection on tryptophan-deficient medium, surviving cells were subjected to plasmid shuffling to eliminate the plasmid carrying the WT actin gene. The mutant plasmid was rescued from surviving trp+,ura− cells and sequenced to ensure that the mutation was still intact. Viable cells were readily obtained for all mutants. Wild-type and His73 mutant actins were purified using a combination of DNase I affinity chromatography, DEAE cellulose chromatography, and subsequent polymerization-depolymerization cycling as described previously (13Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. Carraway K. Carraway C.C. Practical Approaches in Cell Biology. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 99-122Google Scholar). Calcium/G-actin was stored in calcium/G-buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Calcium/actin was converted to the magnesium form by treatment with 0.2 mm EGTA in the presence of 0.1 mmMgCl2 at 25 °C for 10 min as described by Chen and Rubenstein (14Chen X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11406-11414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Pollard (15Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Magnesium/G-actin was used immediately after the conversion from calcium/G-actin. Actins were stored at 4 °C following purification and used within 4 days. Actin polymerization was assessed by the increase in light scattering that occurred following the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl to a G-actin solution in the thermostatted cuvette chamber of a Spex Fluorolog 3 fluorescence spectrometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 360 nm. For all experiments, wild-type actin was run as a control, and experiments were repeated with at least three different batches of actins. To assess cold sensitivity, actin was polymerized at 25 °C until a plateau was reached. The temperature was then lowered to 4 °C over a 15–30-min period of time and subsequently maintained at this temperature during which the change in light scattering was monitored. The apparent melting temperatures of G-actins were determined by circular dichroism according to Chen and Rubenstein (14Chen X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11406-11414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 1.4 μm G-actin was heated at a constant rate of 1 °C/min over a range from 20 to 80 °C with constant stirring of the samples over the entire range tested. Changes in the ellipticity of actin samples were monitored at 222 nm in an AVIV 62 DS spectropolarimeter. Data were fitted to a two-state model with a single transition between a native and a denatured form of the protein and the T m value was defined as the temperature when 50% of the G-actin was in the denatured form. Unbound ATP was removed from a 5 μm G-actin solution by gel filtration, and the actin was incubated with 0.3 mm etheno-ATP at 4 °C for 2 h. Excess nucleotide was removed by gel filtration. The subsequent actin solution was mixed with 0.1 mm ATP and the decay in fluorescence that accompanied release of the etheno nucleotide from the actin was monitored as a function of time with excitation and emission wavelengths at 340 and 410 nm, respectively. For rapid reactions, a stopped-flow fluorescence spectrometer was employed. Nucleotide exchange rates were derived by fitting the data to a single exponential expression. Actin (5 μm) polymerized at 25 °C was applied to carbon-coated Formvar grids and visualized following negaitve staining with 1.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate using a Hitachi 7000 electron microscope (University of Iowa Electron Microscope Facility). Alterations in the tertiary structure of G-actins were monitored by the susceptibility of the actins (9 μm) to limited digestion by the following three enzymes at the indicated actin/protease ratios (w/w): trypsin (80:1), subtilisin (400:1), and chymotrypsin (16:1) essentially as described previously (16Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out at room temperature for the desired time. The digestion with trypsin was stopped with 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and the digestion with the other two proteases was stopped with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were then separated by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Molecular dynamics simulations of actin were carried out using the program X-PLOR (17Brunger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) with the CHARMM-22 all-hydrogen force field (18Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13939) Google Scholar). The structure of ATP-actin taken as the initial model was from the actin-gelsolin segment-1 complex (5McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), prepared with magnesium as divalent cation and solvated with 1,159 explicit water molecules as described in Ref. 8Wriggers W. Schulten K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar. The originally methylated MeHis73 (5McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) was replaced by unmethylated histidine in three different protonation states (proton on the δ1 nitrogen or on the ε2 nitrogen or on both) for the control simulations, and by charged arginine and glutamate for the H73R and H73E mutants, respectively. The systems were subsequently refined by simulated annealing protocols. Simulated annealing is a conformational search technique that allows biomolecules to pass barriers between local minima in the complex energy landscape of proteins, faster than would be realized by simulations at room temperature. The method, thereby, accelerates the relaxation of the system from any less favorable interactions created by the mutation of His73. Simulated annealing protocols were successfully employed in earlier computational studies of kinesin (19Wriggers W. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 646-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and apolipoprotein A-1 (20Phillips J.C. Wriggers W. Li Z. Jonas A. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2337-2346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here we chose protocols of 170-ps length with a maximum temperature of 500 K. We wished to address the question of how His73 affects the stability, tertiary structure, nucleotide exchange, and polymerization of actin. For this purpose, we used site-directed mutagenesis to substitute His73 with Arg, Lys, Ala, Gln, and Glu and replaced the WT actin gene with the mutant actin genes in S. cerevisiae as described under “Materials and Methods.” Viable haploid yeast cells producing only the desired mutant actins were readily obtained for each of the substitutions, and the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by rescuing the plasmid from yeast and resequencing the DNA. To determine any defects caused by His73mutations in vivo, we first determined the growth rates of cells expressing each of the mutant actins. In liquid YPD medium at 10, 30, and 37 °C no appreciable difference was found between the generation times of each of the mutant cells and wild-type cells at the temperature tested (data not shown). Phase-contrast microscopy revealed no overt difference in either the size or morphology of the mutant cells compared with their wild-type counterpart. Calcofluor staining (21Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 193: 732-734Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar) showed that all the mutant cells displayed well formed chitin rings at the sites of previous budding events and the axial budding polarity typical of yeast (data not shown). To visualize the actin cytoskeleton directly, we stained wild-type and mutant cells with rhodamine/phalloidin (22Adams A.E. Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Again, there appeared to be no distinct difference in the phalloidin/staining patterns exhibited by mutant and WT cells in terms of the presence and distribution of cables and cortical patches. In order to interpret results obtained from phosphate release assays, we first had to assess the effects of these mutations on actin monomer structure and polymerizability. Fig. 2 shows the polymerization of the calcium form of each of the mutant and WT actins induced by the addition of salt to the appropriate G-actin solutions as described under “Materials and Methods.” At 25 °C, each of the mutations had a noticeable effect on the rate of polymerization. The cationic substitutions, Lys and Arg, produced the mildest retardation in rates followed by Ala and Gln. The Glu mutation appeared to cause the most extensive retardation in polymerization. Despite the slower polymerization of the mutant actins compared with WT actin, the extent of polymerization for all the actins except for H73E was essentially the same, suggesting that the critical concentrations of the mutant and wild-type actins are roughly identical. H73E might either have a higher critical concentration than wild-type or is less stable since the extent of polymerization of this mutant varies on a preparation to preparation basis between about 60 and 100%. Results with the magnesium form of the mutants showed the same relative order of effects, although in each case, the magnesium form of these actins polymerized faster than the corresponding calcium form. This has long been known to occur with WT actin. Finally, negatively stained polymerized samples of the Arg, Ala, Gln, and Glu mutations yielded filaments under the electron microscope with a morphology similar to that observed with WT actin. Subdomain 2 of G-actin, containing the DNase I loop, is a rather mobile structure, and the conformation of subdomain 2 and its transitions are important for actin function (23Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 25Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 582-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Conformational changes in subdomain 2 can be probed by limited proteolysis with trypsin, subtilisin, and α-chymotrypsin. Trypsin cleaves subdomain 2 of calcium/G-actin at Arg62-Gly63 and Lys68-Tyr69, yielding 33-kDa C-terminal fragments. Subtilisin cleaves subdomain 2 of calcium/G-actin at Met47-Gly48 and yields a 35-kDa fragment. α-Chymotrypsin cleaves subdomain 2 of calcium/G-actin at Met44-Val45 and Leu67-Lys68, producing 35- and 33-kDa fragments. To determine the effects of the His73 mutations on the conformation of subdomain 2 of G-actin, we carried out limited proteolysis of WT and His73 mutant actins as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 3shows that although controlled digestion of G-WT and G-His73 mutant actins by trypsin, subtilisin, and α-chymotrypsin produced the same digestion patterns, the extent of digestion of H73K actin was less than that of its WT counterpart. In contrast, under the same conditions, the proteolysis of H73E actin appeared to be more extensive than that of its WT counterpart. These results indicate that the digestion sites of these proteases in subdomain 2 of H73K mutant actin are more protected and those of H73E mutant actin are more accessible than those of WT actin. H73R showed an even more protected pattern than H73K (data not shown). Thus, cationic substitutions appeared to confer greater resistance to proteolysis than that observed with WT actin and substitution of Glu for His73 greatly increased susceptibility. Substitution of the neutral residue Ala produced a susceptibility roughly equivalent to that of WT actin. These results were observed with both the magnesium and calcium forms of actin although in all cases, the magnesium/G form is less susceptible than the calcium/G form, consistent with previous results. His73 is located deep in the central cleft of the actin molecule, and the protease digestion sites of subdomain 2 are close to the top of the central cleft. If the His73mutations altered the conformation of the cleft around the nucleotide-binding site as suggested by the protease susceptibility studies, the changes might be manifested by altered rates of exchange of bound nucleotide from the actin. To address this hypothesis, we determined the ATP exchange rates of WT and His73 mutant actins. The Ala, Arg, Lys, and Gln mutations were assessed for their ability to exchange bound etheno-ATP for unbound ATP by monitoring the fluorescence of the bound etheno nucleotide as a function of time as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results, shown in Fig. 4 A, were obtained with all actins in the calcium form. The inset shows the H73R mutation on an extended time scale due to the extremely slow rate of exchange for this mutant actin. Initial attempts to measure the exchange of H73E were unsuccessful due to the rapid rate of exchange of this mutant. Its measurement was ultimately made on a stopped-flow fluorescence spectrometer (Fig. 4 B). Exchange data for the mutants were fit to a first-order decay plot, and thet 12 values were calculated. Our results, shown in Table I, reveal that there is a hierarchy of effects of the different mutations on nucleotide exchange that correlates with the differences seen in protease susceptibility. The Arg substitution produces the longest delay compared with WT actin (almost ×20). Lys slows the exchange but to a much lesser extent than does Arg. Ala is slightly faster than WT as is Gln. Glu greatly accelerates the rate of exchange by about 14 times compared with WT actin. Thus, mutations which seem to produce a tighter, more compact monomeric structure also result in a retarded rate of nucleotide exchange while those which appear to open the structure accelerate the rate of exchange.Table It 1/2 values of ATP exchange of His 73 mutantsWTH73AH73QH73KH73Rt 1/2(s)39342777693 Open table in a new tab Our results so far have suggested that the basic residues result in a tighter, more compact monomer while the neutral and acid residues lead to a looser structure with greater conformational flexibility. To assess this situation further, we carried out circular dichroism experiments to determine the overall thermal stability of the His73 mutant actins. The molar ellipticity at 222 nm, which reflects the content of α-helical structure in G-actin, was monitored as a function of temperature. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Based on the total change in dichroism, the degree of denaturation at each temperature was calculated and the data replotted as the fraction nativeversus temperature. The relative 50% denaturation value is defined as the apparent melting temperature (T m) for the protein, and this value for each of the mutants is shown in Table II. The altered T m value of all the mutants suggest that the nature of the substitution has a direct effect on the thermal stability of the actin monomer, even though residue 73 is on the exterior of the protein. Strongly cationic substitutions increase the stability of the protein over that of the WT protein whereas neutral substitutions cause slightly decreased stability. Substitution of glutamate greatly destabilizes the protein. This gradient of results is consistent with our results from previous experiments.Table IIT m values of His 73 mutant actins (°C)WTH73AH73QH73EH73KH73RMagnesium actin524949435460Calcium actin595856536166 Open table in a new tab One major interstrand force stabilizing the actin filament might be a “plug pocket” arrangement in which a hydrophobic plug at the tip of a loop between subdomain 3 and 4 interacts with a hydrophobic pocket formed by the interface of two subunits on the opposing strand of the helix (27Holmes K.C. Pop D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 28Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Our previous work has shown that mutations in the hydrophobic plug produce effects consistent with a weakening of this proposed plug-pocket interaction and lead to disassembly of filaments at 4 °C (12Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although residue 73 is not directly involved in the proposed interaction, it is on a strand of the polypeptide directly attached to the part of subdomain 2 hypothesized to be part of the “pocket.” If alteration of the conformation around His73 led to an altered conformation in these hypothetical pocket residues, the His73 mutations might produce a “cold sensitivity” like that observed with the hydrophobic plug mutations. Wild-type and mutant actins were polymerized at 25 °C. The temperature was then lowered to 4 °C, and the light scattering was monitored over time. Wild-type actin filaments were stable at 4 °C, as well as were the H73R and Lys filaments (data not shown). In contrast, the three other mutations H73A, Gln, and Glu resulted in actins that depolymerized at 4 °C (Fig. 6 A). Glu always depolymerized completely while the Ala and Gln mutants showed about 80–90% depolymerization depending on the experiment. To determine the reversibility of this cold sensitivity, the temperature was returned to 25 °C in each of the cases, and polymerization was restored to almost the original level (Fig. 6 B). Thus, cold-induced depolymerization did not result in irreversible changes in actin structure. We next performed molecular modeling simulations on WT, H73R, and H73E mutant actins to determine if the absence of a methyl group on His73 of yeast actin caused a realignment of residues at the bottom of actin's interdomain cleft. Also, we wished to better understand the molecular basis for the changes in actin behavior caused by these two His73 mutations. The methyl group on the ε2 nitrogen of MeHis73, present in the crystal structure of muscle actin, was removed to simulate the WT state of yeast actin. The nonionized form of the imidazole ring can exist as two tautomers, with the proton on either the δ1 or ε2 nitrogens (30Creighton T.E. Proteins. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993: 13-14Google Scholar). The hydrogen is usually found on the ε2 nitrogen, but the pK a of the δ1 atom is only about 0.6 pH unit lower than that of ε2. Thus, the position of the proton depends on the conditions of the local environment in the protein, and both forms may exist. Furthermore, histidine is readily protonated with a pK a near 7, in which case the positive charge is shared by the two nitrogens by resonance. We have simulated all three charge states (proton on either atom or on both) starting with the crystal structure of the imidazole for a realistic modeling of the WT yeast actin. Fig. 7, A-D, compares the three charge states of His73 to the position of MeHis73 in the crystal structure (5McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In the cases where the δ1 nitrogen is protonated, the conformation of His73is close to that of MeHis73 in the crystal structure regardless of the protonation state of ε2. The imidazole heavy atoms exhibit a root mean square deviation of only 0.7 and 0.9 Å from corresponding atoms in MeHis73, for protonated and unprotonated ε2, respectively. The relative stability of these two cases is due to a δ1-proton-stabilizing hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen of Gly158 (hydrogen acceptor distances: 1.8 and 1.9 Å, donor hydrogen acceptor angles: 25 and 8°, for protonated and unprotonated ε2, respectively). In contrast, if ε2 alone is protonated, the stabilizing hydrogen bond no longer exists, and the side chain flips about its long axis so that the proton on ε2 is oriented toward the carboxylate of nearby Asp184across the cleft separating the two domains of the protein. In this case, the imidazole exhibits a large root mean square deviation from MeHis73 (1.8 Å), and a salt bridge is formed with Asp184 (hydrogen acceptor distance: 1.9 Å, donor hydrogen acceptor angle: 11°). The conformation of residue 73 in the two simulated mutants, Arg73 and Glu73, are depicted in Fig. 7,E and F, respectively. The positively charged side chain of Arg73 coordinates both carboxylate oxygens of Asp184 (hydrogen acceptor distances: 2.4 and 3.1 Å). On the other hand, Glu73 does not form a salt bridge with Asp184 but with Arg183 (hydrogen acceptor distance: 1.7 Å, donor hydrogen acceptor angle: 16°). Residues 73, 183, and 184 are exposed to adjacent actin monomers in the WT filament (28Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), and their rearrangement in the Glu73 mutant frees the negatively charged Asp184 while neutralizing the positive charge on Arg183. Our results strongly suggest a role for this residue that is much more complex than simply controlling the rate of Pi release from actin as had been originally proposed. His73 appears to be a major determinant of stability and conformational flexibility of the actin monomer despite the fact that it is located on the protein exterior where it can interact with solvent molecules. First, our simulations of actin with His73, as occurs in yeast, instead of the more common MeHis73,predicted the possibility of a second conformational state for this residue and provide a potential clue as to the function of the methyl group found on His73 in the vast majority of actins. This new state, expected to be pH and environment dependent, is stabilized by a salt bridge of the ε2 proton with Asp184. In contrast, the MeHis73-like state involves a weaker hydrogen bond between the δ1 proton and the Gly158 oxygen. The salt bridge with Asp184 would significantly stabilize the protonation of the ε2 and even that of the δ1 nitrogen. In T4 lysozyme, a similar salt bridge between residues Asp70 and His31 altered the pK a values of these two residues from the normal values of 3.5 and 7 to 0.5 and 9, respectively (31Anderson D.E. Becktel W.J. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) contributing 3–5 kcal/mol to the free energy of folding of the protein. Since we started with the crystal conformation that is stabilized by the weaker hydrogen bond, a transition to the salt bridge with Asp184 was not observed in this work for doubly protonated His73. However, a tunneling through the singly ε2 protonated state would lower the barrier for the transition from the MeHis73-like conformation to the salt bridge conformation also for doubly protonated His73. This scenario is likely because ε2 protonation, that is, the state leading to salt bridge formation, is favored over δ1 protonation by the pK a difference of the two nitrogens. We have demonstrated that substitution at this residue with amino acids ranging from more basic to neutral and finally to an acidic residue produces a gradient of effects on actin structure and function. The magnitude and direction of these effects are consistent with the hypothesis that the imidazole of His73 may interact electrostatically with nearby acidic residues, in particular Asp184, on the opposite side of the interdomain cleft in actin to determine the range of movement of the two domains of actin relative to one another. Substitution of His73 with strong cationic residues Arg and Lys seemed to result in a monomer with a tighter conformation as evidenced by a decreased nucleotide exchange rate, decreased rate of proteolysis of subdomain 2, and increased thermal stabilization. A plausible hypothesis is that the stronger positive charge allowed a more stable interaction with Asp184 leading to a less flexible more protected interior of the monomer. The marked difference in effects of the Argversus the Lys substitution might be due to the higher pK a of Arg coupled with the lower flexibility of the protein's side chain allow a stronger interaction to occur with Asp184. The opposite effects were observed with H73E. These results suggest that charge repulsion with one of the acidic residues and subsequent rearrangement of amino acids at the base of the cleft results in a more open and flexible conformation responsible for the greatly enhanced rate of nucleotide exchange, greater protease susceptibility, and lower thermal stability. The results of molecular modeling studies with the Arg and Glu mutants were consistent with the idea of an altered interaction involving Asp184. Substitution of Arg produced a structure with a much stronger level of interaction predicted between the guanidinium group and Asp184 in the second state than would occur with His73. This would lead to the hyperstabilization of the protein we observed experimentally. Substitution of Glu at residue 73 resulted in formation of a predicted salt-bridge between Glu73 and Arg183 with the concomitant breaking of a number of hydrogen bonds due to the resulting distortion of the tertiary structure of the protein. Interactions between residue 73 and 183 or 184 are likely to affect the stability of the actin fold since they link actin subdomains across the nucleotide binding cleft (3Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 4Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C.W. Lindberg U.

In this context, the salt bridges formed by the Arg73 and Glu73 mutants are remarkable. The stronger bond formed by Arg73 would hyperstabilize contacts around the nucleotide leading to the effects we observed experimentally. Conversely, the Glu73-Arg183 salt bridge would lead to a shift of the electrostatic charge on the surface of actin and alter the binding face and binding affinity to the adjacent monomer in the filament (28Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Such a movement might easily alter the ATP-binding site leading to the enhanced nucleotide exchange kinetics, thermal instability, and the altered protease susceptibility we observed. The observed polymerization kinetic effects with little if any change in critical concentration are consistent with our proposal of an electrostatic clamp near the base of the interdomain cleft. G-actin must undergo a conformational change to the F-monomer conformation before it can become incorporated into a growing filament (32Rich S.A. Estes J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 777-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). An increased interaction of residue 73 with Asp184 might result in the retardation of the rate at which this change occurs leading to slower polymerization. Elimination of the positive charge might impart enough increased conformational flexibility to make it easier for the protein to sample additional conformational states thereby retarding attainment of the F-monomer conformation. The rearrangement at the base of the cleft predicted with the Glu mutation might alter the rate at which the protein enters the F-monomer state resulting in even slower polymerization. However, the numerous inter-monomer contacts that develop during filament assembly might compensate for these altered monomer conformations with little net effect on critical concentration. The cold-sensitive polymerization of the Ala, Glu, and Gln mutations but not the Arg and Lys species is intriguing. According to the hydrophobic plug-pocket proposal for filament stabilization, residues 63 and 64 along with residues 40–45 would constitute part of the hydrophobic surface that comprises the pocket in this interaction. Hydrophobic interactions are cold-sensitive, and we had previously demonstrated that mutations in plug residues resulted in cold-sensitive polymerization behavior. Neutralization of the positive charge at residue 73 produced an increased protease susceptibility in this region and moderate cold-sensitive behavior which was accentuated by substitution of an anionic residue. Altering the geometry of residues at the bottom of the interdomain cleft in actin likely results in a change of the surface at the top of subdomain 2. Such an alteration would cause a distortion in the pocket proposed by Holmes et al. (33Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), thereby decreasing the energy of the proposed hydrophobic interaction resulting in cold sensitivity. The smaller effect observed with the His73 mutations as opposed to that seen with the plug mutants may simply reflect the change in total hydrophobic surface that a single mutation in the plug makes relative to one in the larger pocket. A second possible explanation is that His73 mutations alter the conformation of the plug in the same monomer by conformational changes propagated through the nucleotide bridge or interdomain cleft. However, the relatively large distance of the His73imidazole from the ATP γ-phosphate coupled with the cold sensitivity of the neutral mutations despite their relatively small effect on monomer structure argues against this second possibility. In either case, the lack of a clear defective phenotype in vivo most probably reflects the fact that the conformational alterations produced by the mutations are at least in part cancelled by monomer-monomer interactions and the association of actin with different actin-binding proteins in the cell. We originally wished to test the hypothesis that His73regulates the rate of Pi release from F-actin following actin-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP. However, from this study, His73 clearly plays an important role as a structural determinant of the actin monomer with concomitant effects on actin function. Therefore, one will have to be cautious in the interpretation of assays that may indicate a difference in the rate of Pirelease from WT versus the His73 mutant species."

The autosomal recessive disorder known as mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS-IIIA) is caused by a deficiency of sulfamidase, leading to patients developing a clinical phenotype of Sanfilippo syndrome. This disorder is one of four MPS-III subtypes (A, B, C, and D) that are a subset of a group of disorders known as the mucopolysaccharidoses, caused by a deficiency in one of 10 exoenzymes necessary for the lysosomal degradation of keratan, heparan, and dermatan sulfates. The incidence of the combined MPS-III subtypes has been estimated at 1 in 24,000 births (1van de Kamp J.J.P. Niermeijer M.F. von Figura K. Giesberts M.A.H. Clin. Genet. 1981; 20: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and 1 in 66,000 in Australia (2Meikle P.J. Hopwood J.J. Clague A.E. Carey W.F. JAMA. 1999; 281: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), with MPS-IIIA the most common subtype in Northern Europe and Australia. Unlike other sulfatases, which catalyze the hydrolysis ofO-linked sulfate groups, NS catalyzes the hydrolysis of theN-linked sulfate group from the nonreducing terminal glucosamine residues of HS (the only N-sulfated glycosaminoglycan). Two other enzymes are involved exclusively in the degradation of HS, with functional deficiencies of these causing two other MPS-III subtypes: MPS-IIIB (α-N-acetylglucosaminidase deficiency) and MPS-IIIC (acetyl-CoA-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase deficiency). The last MPS-III subtype, MPS-IIID, is defined by a deficiency ofN-acetylglucosaminide-6-sulfatase, which degrades both HS and keratan sulfate. In patients with this disorder, HS is the only glycosaminoglycan stored, since an alternative pathway exists for the degradation of keratan sulfate (3Hopwood J.J. Elliott H. Biochem. Int. 1983; 6: 831-836PubMed Google Scholar). Since a common enzymatic link between the MPS-III subtypes is present, a common biochemical disease phenotype (elevated levels of excreted HS in urine and HS storage) and clinical presentation results. This is normally characterized by severe and progressive mental deterioration (4Neufeld E.F. Muenzer J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2465-2494Google Scholar). The similarity in presentation means that diagnostic analysis of the combined MPS-III subtypes depends on enzymatic analysis, which is further complicated by minimal skeletal involvement and false negative tests, by some methods, for heparan sulfaturia, leading to a delayed diagnosis (4Neufeld E.F. Muenzer J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2465-2494Google Scholar). Symptoms that typify MPS-IIIA syndrome may begin after a short period of apparently normal development. Subsequent patterns of neurodegeneration develop that include rapid loss of social skills with aggressive behavior and hyperactivity, disturbed sleep patterns, hirsutism, coarse facies, and diarrhea. In profoundly affected patients, delayed speech development is often noticed at 2 years of age. As in other MPS conditions, considerable variation in the onset and severity of the clinical phenotype are observed. NS has been purified from a number of human tissues as a 56-kDa polypeptide (5Freeman C. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass of NS is 54,679 Da, and the sequence contains five potential N-glycosylation sites at positions 41, 142, 151, 264, and 413, with the first known to be functional through N-terminal amino acid sequencing (6Scott H.S. Blanch L. Guo X.-H. Freeman C. Osborn A. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Morris C.P. Hopwood J.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 465-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The recombinant human precursor (62-kDa) and mature (56-kDa) forms expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have molecular masses within this range (7Bielicki J. Hopwood J.J. Melville E.L. Anson D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the glycosylation and phosphorylation properties of NS have not been previously investigated, uptake and correction studies of rhNS on MPS-IIIA fibroblasts (7Bielicki J. Hopwood J.J. Melville E.L. Anson D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have indicated that this process is dependent on the presence of phosphorylated mannose residues. Both the genomic and cDNA sequences encoding NS have been cloned and characterized (6Scott H.S. Blanch L. Guo X.-H. Freeman C. Osborn A. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Morris C.P. Hopwood J.J. Nat.

Mutat. 1998; 12: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) has identified a large number of genetic defects present in MPS-IIIA patients, with considerable genotypical heterogeneity. However, certain mutations show a definite prevalence in different geographical regions. For example, R245H accounts for 56% of mutant alleles in MPS-IIIA patients in The Netherlands (13Weber B. Van De Kamp J.J.P. Kleijer W.J. Guo X-H. Blanch L. Van Diggelen O.P. Wevers R. Poorthuis B.J.H.M. Hopwood J.J. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with S66W showing prevalence in Italy with 33% of alleles (11Di Natale P. Balzano N. Esposito S. Villani G.R. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); R74C alone accounts for more than 50% of alleles in MPS-IIIA patients in Poland (10Bunge S. Ince H. Steglich C. Kleijer W.J. Beck M. Zaremba J. Van Diggelen O.P. Weber B. Hopwood J.J. Gal A. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 10: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); and delC1091 accounts for almost half of the mutations in Spanish MPS-IIIA patients (12Montfort M. Vilageliu L. Garciagiralt N. Guidi S. Coll M.J. Chabas A. Grinberg D. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 12: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite an increased effort to identify mutations in the NS gene, interpretation of clinical phenotype remains difficult, with identical genotypes often manifesting within a broad clinical spectrum (11Di Natale P. Balzano N. Esposito S. Villani G.R. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These previous studies have relied on clinical analysis of patient data in order to determine the effect of identified mutations on the activity of the wild type enzyme. Thus far, no studies have directly investigated the effect of MPS-IIIA mutations through direct expression of mutated rhNS. In this study, we have been able to provide a more detailed study of the maturation process of rhNS through the isolation of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Further, the introduction of the three most common clinically severe mutations, S66W, R74C, and R245H, into the wild type rhNS expression vector has been used to determine their effect on the synthesis of NS, specific activity, and presence of carbohydrate moieties. This study aims to provide a more complete understanding of the previously described properties of rhNS (7Bielicki J. Hopwood J.J. Melville E.L. Anson D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in order to understand the effect of severe mutations present in MPS-IIIA patients. Structural data, together with the functional data obtained from the mutational analysis, will contribute greatly toward understanding of the enzymatic mechanism of the sulfatase family in general and the specificities of sulfamidase. The effect of mutations on rhNS will have implications for patient diagnosis and prognosis and provide a valuable insight for the eventual development of a therapy. Preparations of rhNS from a high expressing CHO system (7Bielicki J. Hopwood J.J. Melville E.L. Anson D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were column-purified and used to raise monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. A standard immunization and fusion protocol was used to generate monoclonal antibodies (14Clements P.R. Brooks D.A. Saccone G.T.P. Hopwood J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with products screened for antibody activity against purified rhNS through enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay with a peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody detection system (Bio-Rad). Briefly, 1 μg of rhNS was added to 10 mm PBS, pH 7, in a total volume of 150 μl, added to individual wells of a polyvinyl chloride plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA), and incubated at 37° C for 1 h. Each well was aspirated, and the remaining reactive sites were blocked by adding buffer A (150 μl of 10 mm PBS, pH 7, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for an additional 1 h at 37° C. The wells were aspirated, washed three times with wash buffer (10 mm PBS, pH 7), and incubated with 150 μl of the hybridoma supernatant to be tested for 1 h at 37° C. The wells were aspirated, washed, and incubated with an affinity-purified horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin second antibody (1:1000 dilution (v/v) in buffer A) (Silenus Laboratories) for 1 h at 37° C. The antibody was removed, and the wells were washed three times with 150 μl of wash buffer. This was aspirated, and 100 μl of peroxidase substrate (ABTS substrate kit; Bio-Rad) was added to each well. After 5–10 min, color development was quantified by measuring absorbance at 414 nm on an automated enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) reader (Titertek Multiscan; Flow Laboratories). Three hybridoma cell lines were chosen for further characterization. These were αrhNS-22.D5, αrhNS-13.C, and αrhNS-23.B2. Large scale preparations of the antibody αrhNS-22.D5 were obtained using the Immunopure IgM Purification Kit (Pierce) using the column and instructions provided. For the αrhNS polyclonal and the IgG1 monoclonal αrhNS-13.C1, octanoic acid precipitation was used. Hybridoma serum obtained from the IgG2a monoclonal αrhNS-23.B2 was used without being concentrated. A polyclonal antibody was prepared in a rabbit against rhNS using 200 μg of prepared protein/injection. The polyclonal antiserum had a titer of 1:1,500,000 as shown by ELISA, as described below. An IgG fraction was prepared by precipitation with octanoic acid and concentrated to 12 μg/μl. Through immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments, the αrhNS polyclonal was shown to recognize both mature and precursor forms of rhNS in addition to NS obtained from normal and mutant fibroblast cell lines. rhNS and CHO cell extracts obtained from normal and mutant cell lines pcDNA3ns2, pcDNA3ns2.66W, and pcDNA3ns2.74C were electrophoresed in a 12.5% polyacrylamide, 4% stacking gel (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membrane was presoaked in transfer solution (10 mm CAPS, 10% (v/v) MeOH) and then placed in direct contact with the polyacrylamide gel. The gel and nitrocellulose were prepared for protein transfer as described previously (16Brooks D.A. McCourt P.A.G. Gibson G.J. Hopwood J.J. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1990; 13: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and then placed in transfer solution, and electrophoretic transfer was carried out toward the anode at 250-mA constant current for 1.5 h. After transfer, the membrane was removed and washed three times in 10 mm PBS before being placed in blocking solution (10 mm PBS, 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose membrane was then washed three times with 10 mm PBS and placed in blocking solution containing 15 μg/ml αrhNS polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C, after which it was washed three times with 10 mm PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking solution containing a 1:500 dilution (v/v) of a peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody (Silenus Laboratories). The membrane was then washed with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7, 0.25 m NaCl) and developed in 20 ml of 4-chloro-1-napthol color development reagent as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad) or, alternatively, using an ECL development kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the supplied protocol. A sandwich ELISA was developed to quantitate wild type and mutant NS levels in CHO cell constructs and cultured skin fibroblasts. Ten μg of total IgG isolated from rabbit αrhNS serum was added to 10 mm PBS, pH 7, in a total volume of 150 μl and added to individual wells of a polyvinyl chloride plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Each well was aspirated, and the remaining reactive sites were blocked by adding buffer A (150 μl of 10 mm PBS, pH 7, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were then aspirated, washed three times with wash buffer (10 mm PBS, pH 7), and incubated with 150 μl of the NS sample to be quantified. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the wells were aspirated, washed, and incubated with one of a panel of murine αrhNS monoclonal antibodies at a concentration of 1 μg/well diluted in buffer A and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were aspirated, washed, and incubated with an affinity-purified horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin second antibody (1:1000 dilution (v/v) in buffer A) (Silenus Laboratories) for 1 h at 37 °C. The antibody was removed, and the wells were washed three times with 150 μl of wash buffer. This was aspirated, and 100 μl of peroxidase substrate (ABTS substrate kit; Bio-Rad) was added to each well. After 5–10 min, color development was quantified by measuring absorbance at 414 nm on an automated ELISA reader (Titertek Multiscan; Flow Laboratories). All results were extrapolated through a standard curve and were expressed as ng of NS/mg of cell protein (Fig. 1). Sulfamidase mutants S66W, R74C, and R245H were introduced, using single-stranded oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar), into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing the full-length sulfamidase cDNA (pcDNA3ns2; previously identified (6Scott H.S. Blanch L. Guo X.-H. Freeman C. Osborn A. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Morris C.P. Hopwood J.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 465-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) as pcDNASFL8). The antisense oligonucleotides 5′-GCTGCTTGCTGACCCAGGTGAAGG-3′ (66W) and 5′-GAGGCTGGCGCAGCTGGGAGA-3′ (74C) were used to construct the appropriate vector. Positive clones were identified by autoradiography. The missense mutation R245H was introduced into the wild type vector using a polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis approach (QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) with the mutant forward (5′-CCACCGTCGGCCACATGGACCAAGG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCTTGGTCCATGTGGCCACGGTGG-3′) cDNA sequence. All mutants were confirmed through automated polymerase chain reaction sequencing using methods outlined in the Taq Dye DeoxyTM Terminator Cycle FS Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). Large scale preparations of mutant and wild type plasmids were column-purified using a commercially available kit (Qiagen), using the instructions provided. Large scale plasmid preparations of pcDNA3ns2 (wild type), pcDNA3ns2.66W, pcDNA3ns2.74C, and pcDNA3ns2.245H (25 μg) were electroporated into CHO cells as described previously (18Anson D.S. Taylor J.A. Bielicki J. Harper G.S. Peters C. Gibson G.J. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected with 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (G418) and maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (CSL Ltd.). G418-resistant mass cultures of CHO-K1 cells expressing wild type rhNS (pcDNA3.ns2), S66W-ns, R74C-ns, and R245H-ns were grown to confluency in two 75-cm2 flasks. The sulfamidase activity of the normal and mutant expression constructs was measured in mass cultures of G418-resistant cells. The three cell lines were subcultured and grown synchronously before assay when the cells had reached a quiescent stage of growth, 4 days postconfluence. The expression of the mutant cell lines was calculated as a percentage of normal in three separate experiments using the tritiated tetrasaccharide substrate (19Hopwood J.J. Elliott H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1982; 123: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and immunoquantification of sulfamidase (in pg/mg or ng/mg of rhNS/cell protein). G418-resistant mass cultures of CHO cell lines expressing normal, S66W, and R74C sulfamidase were grown to confluency in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks. The cells were preincubated for 1 h in 2 ml of Eagle's modified minimal essential deficient media containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed FCS (methionine- and cysteine-free, supplemented with 100 mmglutamine), and then metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix for 30 min. Labeling medium was removed, and cells were rinsed in serum-free medium and then chased in 3 ml of Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS. After 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h, the chased medium was collected and clarified by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). At each time point, cells from one flask in each group were harvested with trypsin-versene (Life Technologies, Inc.), washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (PBS containing 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and used for immunoprecipitation. Overnight labeling of CHO cells for the purpose of glycosylation studies was performed as above, except 0.020 mCi/ml EXPRE35S35S was used for labeling purposes. Growth media and solubilized cell lysates were immunoabsorbed using the rabbit polyclonal raised against rhNS (1:1; 500,000 titer) and Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem; 50 μl) and analyzed via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (20Yogalingam G.

Cells were grown to confluency in a T25 tissue culture flask, washed three times with PBS, and then starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium PO4−-free medium without FCS. These cells were labeled with 2 mCi of labeled phosphate ([33P]orthophosphate (>3000 Ci/mmol) in dilute hydrochloric acid, pH 2–3, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without PO4− and with 10% (v/v) FCS for 1 h at 37 °C. The medium used in the labeling phase was removed and replaced with chase medium (F-12 plus 10% (v/v) FCS) for 4 h. The medium was collected, and the cells were harvested with 10% (w/v) trypsin. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (PBS containing 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and used for immunoprecipitation and glycosylation studies. Pansorbin pellets of immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended and boiled for 5 min in 40 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, containing 1% (w/v) SDS and 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation, 20 μl was used in both Endo H and PNGase F (New England Biolabs) digestions. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm sodium citrate (with 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 for PNGase F) with 1000 units of Endo H or PNGase F. Incubations were overnight at 37 °C. Eleven clones containing antibodies against column-purified rhNS were detected by ELISA, selected, and isotyped. Western blot analysis of the characterized panel of monoclonal antibodies indicated that none bound denatured rhNS. However, all of the monoclonal antibodies recognize structural epitopes, since they bind seminative sulfamidase in ELISA, which renders them useful in immunoprecipitation experiments and, in the case of the IgG2a αrhNS-23.B2, to couple to a matrix in an affinity column to improve purification yields of rhNS. ELISA-based experiments, in combination with the polyclonal antibody raised against rhNS, were utilized to determine an antibody that could be used to quantify rhNS. The three most suitable candidates, αrhNS-13.C1, αrhNS-22.D5, and αrhNS-23.B2 (an IgG1, a column-purified IgM, and an IgG2a, respectively), were identified using quantification studies through a developed sandwich ELISA protocol with the polyclonal antibody raised against rhNS. The αrhNS polyclonal antibody was raised and characterized through immunoblotting experiments to be specific to both mature and precursor forms of rhNS (Fig. 2) and was deemed suitable for use in immunoprecipitation and quantification experiments. To enable the quantification of normal and mutant rhNS and native NS from skin fibroblasts, a sandwich ELISA was developed using the polyclonal antibody and the three monoclonal antibodies (αrhNS-13.C1, αrhNS-23.B2, and αrhNS-22.D5). All recognized wild type NS (Table I). Interestingly, in the analysis of the sulfamidase mutants, two of the antibodies (αrhNS-13.C1 and αrhNS-22.D5) were able to detect significantly more of the rhNS expressed with S66W and R74C than the IgG2a antibody. It is postulated that this result is due to the decreased ability of the αrhNS-23.B2 antibody to bind to the mutant protein, probably through a structural alteration in the protein close to the epitope-binding site. The proximity of the two mutants in amino acid sequence, and presumably structurally, would lend support to this proposal, especially since protein levels of the C-terminally located mutant R245H, which is thought to lie at the end of an α-helix near the surface of the protein away from the active site when compared with the structure of N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase, was similar for all three antibodies. Results (Table I) strongly indicate that there is a significant decrease in the protein level for R245H and not a significant structural alteration in which the epitopes to which all three antibodies bind are destroyed.Table ITotal protein and specific activity of wild type rhNS and expression constructs S66W, R74C, and R245HExpression construct and antibodyrhNS proteinrhNS activitySpecific activityaValues in the separate experiments are similar to the specific activity for rhNS (822 nmol/min/mg (Bielicki et al.(1998)).ng/mg cell proteinnmol/min/mg cell proteinnmol/min/mg rhNSWild type (pcDNA3ns2)αrhNS-22.D57305 ± 119.56.6668 ± 0.89895.88αrhNS-23.B26306 ± 477.9, 8,234 ± 236.25.50367 ± 0.85, 7.78736 ± 0.41862.63, 940.68S66W (pcDNA3ns2.66W)αrhNS-22.D5130 ± 13.810.01370 ± 0.29 (0.21%)105.38 (12%)αrhNS-23.B234.85 ± 9.270.0165225 ± 0.00025 (0.3%)474.10 (52%)αrhNS-13.C1124 ± 32.920.0165225 ± 0.00025 (0.3%)126.19 (15%) Overnight incubation124 ± 32.920.011508 ± 0.00081 (0.21%)92.74 (13%)αrhNS-23.B2 from S66W (+/+) fibroblastbTaken from the fibroblast experiments (K.

Open table in a new tab In an attempt to understand the processing pathway of rhNS, pulse-chase experiments were performed in stably expressing CHO cell lines containing the normal rhNS expression construct, pcDNA3ns2. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the intracellular form of35S-labeled rhNS remains stable over a 1-day chase period, encompassing processing of precursor to mature form between 8 and 24 h postlabeling. The secretion of precursor rhNS into the medium was detected 30 min after labeling, where the amount increases for up to 8 h. A slight degradation was observed 1 day after labeling (Fig. 3). In addition, G418-resistant mass cultures of rhNS-S66W and rhNS-R74C were metabolically pulse-labeled with EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix. Cells were then chased for varying time periods of up to 24 h. Immunoprecipitation of the mutant cell homogenates indicated faint bands of mature enzyme produced from S66W and R74C. Since the resolution of mutant sulfamidase expressed from the CHO cell system was difficult to determine from these studies (being at least 100-fold less than normal rhNS), cell extract samples containing the normal expression vector and those containing mutant sequences were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, with purified rhNS from the CHO expression system as a control. The samples were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, the extra sites were blocked, the αrhNS polyclonal antibody was added, and then the samples were washed, and the membrane was developed using ECL. Banding patterns corresponding to rhNS for both mutants were present that were not observed in the CHO control. The amount of protein produced from R245H was insufficient to enable clear vie"
https://openalex.org/W2007252914,"The sterile α motif (SAM) domain is a protein module found in many diverse signaling proteins. SAM domains in some systems have been shown to self-associate. Previous crystal structures of an EphA4-SAM domain dimer (Stapleton, D., Balan, I., Pawson, T., and Sicheri, F. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6, 44–49) and a possible EphB2-SAM oligomer (Thanos, C.

Within the arm, a conserved hydrophobic residue (Tyr-8 in the EphB2-SAM structure or Phe-910 in the EphA4-SAM structure) is anchored into a hydrophobic cleft on a neighboring molecule. Here we have solved a new crystal form of the human EphB2-SAM domain that has the same overall SAM domain fold yet has no substantial intermolecular contacts. In the new structure, the N-terminal peptide arm of the EphB2-SAM domain protrudes out from the core of the molecule, leaving both the arm (including Tyr-8) and the hydrophobic cleft solvent-exposed. To verify that Tyr-8 is solvent-exposed in solution, we made a Tyr-8 to Ala-8 mutation and found that the EphB2-SAM domain structure and stability were only slightly altered. These results suggest that Tyr-8 is not part of the hydrophobic core of the EphB2-SAM domain and is conserved for functional reasons.

This family of receptors has been implicated in many developmental processes including axon guidance and bundling (3Drescher U. Kremoser C. Handwerker C. Loschinger J. Noda M. Bonhoeffer F.

Science. 1995; 268: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). SAM domains are found at the C terminus of the Eph receptors, adjacent to the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase catalytic domain (2Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although the role of SAM domains in Eph receptor signaling remains unclear, isolated SAM domains from numerous systems are known to self-associate. First, SAM domains from various polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which regulate homeotic gene transcription, form specific homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers (12Kyba M. Brock H. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Second, the SAM domains of Byr2 and Ste4, proteins that regulate sporulation in the yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe, form a hetero-oligomer (13Barr M.M. Tu H. Van Aelst L. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5597-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,14Tu H. Barr M. Dong D.L. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5876-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Third, the SAM domain from the TEL transcription factor has been shown to self-associate (15Jousset C. Carron C. Boureux A. Quang C. Oury C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Charon M. Levin J. Bernard O. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Finally, Stapleton et al. (16Stapleton D. Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) show that the EphA4 receptor SAM domain dimerizes weakly (16Stapleton D. Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus the Eph-SAM domains might play a role in receptor oligomerization. Eph-SAM domains have also been implicated in binding downstream signaling components to the receptor. First, many Eph-SAMs contain PDZ domain recognition motifs at their C termini. This motif is recognized by the PDZ domains in the proteins AF-6, GRIP-1, and PICK1 (17Bruckner K. Pablo Labrador J. Scheiffele P. Herb A. Seeburg P.H. Klein R.

It has been suggested that PDZ domain-containing proteins participate in organization and clustering of the Eph receptor during activation (22Torres R. Firestein B.L. Dong H. Staudinger J. Olson E.N.

Second, Eph-SAMs have been implicated in protein-tyrosine phosphatase binding. Stein et al. (23Stein E. Cerretti D. Schoekcklmann H. Schroff A. Van Etten R. Daniel T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) reported that the binding of low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase to the EphB1 receptor tyrosine kinase is abrogated by a Y929F mutation in the SAM domain (23Stein E. Cerretti D. Schoekcklmann H. Schroff A. Van Etten R. Daniel T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). A role for SAM domains in protein-tyrosine phosphatase binding is also supported by results of Serra-Pages et al. (24Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), who showed that the LAR (leukocyte common antigen related) protein-tyrosine phosphatase binds to a region of LIP (LAR-interacting protein) that consists of three tandem SAM domains. Third, the same Y929F mutation in EphB1 also abolished binding of the SH2-containing adapter protein Grb10, suggesting that SAMs may also bind SH2 domains (25Stein E. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23588-23593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Four SAM domain structures have now been reported, including the SAM domain from the Ets-1 transcription factor, the SAM domains from two Eph receptors, EphA4 and EphB2, and a C-terminal SAM domain from the p53 homolog, p73 (16Stapleton D. Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 26Slupsky C.M. Gentile L.N. Donaldson L.W. Mackereth C.D. Seidel J.J. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12129-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Thanos C.D. Goodwill K.E. Bowie J.U. Science. 1999; 283: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 28Chi S.W. Ayed A. Arrowsmith C.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4438-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although the Ets-1-SAM and p73-SAM solution structures are monomeric, both the EphA4-SAM and EphB2-SAM structures revealed substantial intermolecular contacts in the crystals, providing possible models for SAM domain quaternary structure. In both models, N-terminal peptide arms on adjacent subunits are swapped into a hydophobic cleft on the surface of a neighbor, burying approximately 2000 Å2 of surface area. Although the intermolecular SAM domain interactions seen in the Eph receptor SAM domain crystal structures are much larger than expected for crystal contacts, the associations in solution are very weak. Stapleton et al. (16Stapleton D. Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) were able to detect dimerization of the EphA4-SAM domain, but the dissociation constant was in the range of 0.5–5 mm. In the case of EphB2-SAM and several other SAM domains described here, the interactions are even weaker. Certainly, a large dissociation constant in solution does not preclude productive association when the domains are tethered to the bilayer, their natural state (29Remy I. Wilson I.A. Michnick S.W. Science. 1999; 283: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the biological importance of the observed oligomeric structures remains unknown. Here we have solved the structure of a new crystal form of the human EphB2-SAM domain, in which no substantial intermolecular interfaces are formed. All reagents were supplied by Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise noted. The genes encoding the SAM domains from the EphB1 receptor (residues 909–986), EphA2 receptor (residues 901–976), and the EphB2 receptor (residues 905–981) were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from a human renal microvascular endothelial cell cDNA library obtained as a gift from Tom Daniel. Each polymerase chain reaction fragment was subcloned into a modified version of the vector pET-3a, pMEKTR. This vector adds the amino acid leader sequence MEKTR to the beginning of the protein. Each pMEKTR-Eph-SAM construct was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL-21. To express the protein, a saturated 500-ml overnight culture of pMEKTR-EphSAM/BL21 grown in LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LB-A) was added to 10 liters of LB-A. The culture was incubated with shaking at 37 °C until theA 600 reached 1.0. At this point, expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 200 μm, and incubation was continued for 5 h. Approximately 30–40 g of wet cells were collected/10 liters of culture used and stored at −80 °C. The Eph-B1 SAM domain was purified from inclusion bodies. To prevent oxidation of cysteine residues, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to all buffers. For a typical preparation, 30 g of cells were suspended in 300 ml of 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and lysed by sonication. Cell debris and inclusion bodies were pelleted by centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The inclusion bodies were washed twice by resuspending the pellet in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 2m urea, and 5% Triton X-100 using a Wheaton tissue homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The inclusion bodies were then solubilized in 6m guanidine-HCl, 100 mm phosphate (pH 8.0) and diluted to an A 280 of 0.25. The protein was refolded by dialysis into 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% sodium azide. At this point, the sample was passed through two disposable Waters Sep-Pak QMA and two Waters Sep-Pak CM columns. The flow-through was pooled and dialyzed into 50 mm phosphate (pH 9.0). The sample was then passed through another disposable Sep-Pak QMA column, and the flow-through was collected. The sample was then dialyzed into 50 mmphosphate (pH 6.0) and loaded onto a Pharmacia XK-26/20 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) packed with Waters CM resin. The protein was eluted from the column using a gradient ranging from 0 to 0.7m NaCl over 70 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and peak fractions were collected. The protein was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris (pH 9.0), concentrated to 12.5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration, and snap-frozen at −80 °C in 100-μl aliquots. The protein was greater than 99% pure at this point. Approximately 20 grams of wet cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mm EDTA). Cells were lysed by sonication and spun down at 17,000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The supernatant was loaded onto a Pharmacia XK-26/20 column packed with Waters CM resin and equilibrated in buffer A. The protein was eluted from the column using an increasing NaCl gradient ranging from 0 to 0.7 m NaCl in buffer A over 70 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed into buffer B (50 mm Tris (pH 9.0), 5 mm EDTA). The sample was then loaded onto a Pharmacia XK-26/20 column packed with Waters QMA resin equilibrated in buffer B. The protein was eluted using a gradient ranging from 0 to 0.7m NaCl in buffer B over 70 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed into buffer C (100 mm phosphate (pH 6.0), 5 mm EDTA) and loaded onto a Pharmacia XK-26/20 column packed with Waters CM resin equilibrated in buffer C. The protein was eluted using a gradient ranging from 0 to 0.7 m NaCl in buffer B over 70 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peak fractions were pooled and snap-frozen at −80 °C. For a typical preparation, 35 g of thawed cells were suspended in 350 ml of 50 mm phosphate (pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors 200 μm EDTA, 0.5 mg/liter leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protease inhibitors were added to all buffers. The cells were lysed by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. Ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 40% (w/v). The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 20 min. The ammonium sulfate concentration of the supernatant was then raised to 60% (w/v), and the precipitate was recovered by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.0) and dialyzed into 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.0). The sample was then passed through two disposable Waters Sep-Pak QMA and two Waters Sep-Pak CM columns, and the flow-through was retained. The sample was then dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and loaded onto a Pharmacia XK-26/20 column packed with Waters QMA resin. The protein was eluted from the column using a gradient ranging from 0 to 0.7m NaCl over 70 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated by 75% ammonium sulfate precipitation, and redissolved in 2 ml of 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.5). The sample was then loaded onto a Pharmacia XK-26/100 column packed with Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration media equlibrated in 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.5) and developed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Peak fractions were collected and pooled. At this point, the protein was greater than 95% pure. To remove a residual contaminant, the protein was dialyzed into 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.5), loaded onto a Pharmacia XK-26/20 column packed with Waters QMA resin, and eluted with a gradient from 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.5) to 50 mm phosphate (pH 6) over 30 min at 1 ml/min. The pure protein was dialyzed into 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), concentrated to 20 mg/ml by ultrafiltration, and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed at 4 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using absorption optics at 280 nm. A 12-mm path length, six-sector cell was used for protein concentrations of 0.77 mg/ml, and a 3-mm path length double sector cell was used for protein concentrations of 3.0 mg/ml. All samples were in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0). Sedimentation equilibrium profiles were measured at 18,000 and 24,000 rpm for EphB2-SAM at 3.0 mg/ml and at 24,000 and 30,000 rpm for EphB2-SAM at 0.77 mg/ml. The data were fitted with a nonlinear least squares exponential fit for a single ideal species using the Beckman Origin-based software (Version 3.01). To calculate an apparent monomer-dimer association constant for EphB2-SAM, Beckman global analysis software was used to analyze four scans simultaneously: 0.77 mg/ml protein at 24,000 and 30,000 rpm and 3.00 mg/ml protein at 18,000 and 24,000 rpm. Partial specific volumes of 0.714 for EphB2-SAM and 0.722 for EphB1-SAM and EphA2-SAM were calculated from the amino acid composition and corrected to 4 °C (30Cohn E. Edsall J.

Crystals of EphB2-SAM were grown by the hanging drop method. The drop contained 20 mg/ml EphB2-SAM in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 87.5 mm LiSO4, 15% polyethylene glycol-6000. The reservoir contained 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 175 mm LiSO4, and 30% polyethylene glycol-6000. The crystals grew reliably after a 1–2-day incubation at room temperature to dimensions of approximately 0.4 × 0.4 × 5 mm. The x-ray data were collected at Brookhaven National Laboratory on beamline X12C using a Brandeis CCD area detector at 100 K. The data were reduced using Denzo and Scalepack (32Otwinowski Z.

The R-factor of the initial solution was 44.4 with a correlation coefficient of 60.6 for data from 40–3.0 Å. The model was refined with cystallography and NMR system (CNS) using the maximum likelihood target function (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Open table in a new tab The mutant was constructed using polymerase chain reaction primer-encoded mutagenesis and subcloned into the glutathione S-transferase fusion vector pGEX-3X. The presence of the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing, and the construct was transformed into BL-21 cells. To express the protein, a saturated 20-ml overnight culture was added to 1 liter of LB media in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and cells were grown to anA 600 of 1.0. Expression was induced by adding 200 μm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside to the cells for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were spun down and divided into 6 pellets and stored at −80 °C. For purification, 1 pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1.8 mm potassium phosphate, 140 mm sodium chloride, and 2.7 mmpotassium chloride (pH 7.3)). The cells were lysed by sonication at 4 °C, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The supernatant was 0.22-μm-filtered and loaded onto 1-ml column of glutathione-Sepharose equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. The column was washed with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and the protein was eluted with 10 ml of 20 mm glutathione in phosphate-buffered saline. The sample was then dialyzed into 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm sodium chloride, and 100 mm ammonium sulfate. To separate the EphB2-SAM-Y8A mutant from glutathioneS-transferase, 19 mg of protein in 1.5 ml was incubated with 100 μg of Factor Xa (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 25 °C for 12 h. The protein was passed through the glutathione-Sepharose column a second time to remove glutathioneS-transferase. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra and thermal melting curves were collected on an AVIV 62DS spectrapolarimeter. Spectra were collected at 4 °C in 0.1-mm path length quartz cuvettes with 1.5 mg/ml protein in 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.0). A set of 20 scans was averaged for each spectrum. The scans were collected at 1.0-nm intervals with a 1.0-nm bandwidth and a 1-s time constant. Thermal melts were performed in 1.0-cm path length cells at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.0). The ellipticity at 222 nm was measured every 2.5 °C, equilibrating for 1 min at each temperature and recording for 30 s. SAM domains from the human EphB1, EphB2, and EphA2 receptors were cloned, expressed in E. coli, and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Circular dichroism spectra of all the Eph receptor SAM domains are quite similar (Fig. 1). The estimated helical content, based on the ellipticity at 208 nm (36Copeland R.A. Methods for Protein Analysis: A Practical Guide to Laboratory Protocols. Chapman & Hall, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar), ranges from 55% for EphA2-SAM to 65% for EphB2-SAM. The helical content observed in solution is in reasonable agreement with the 60% helical content seen in the EphB2 crystal structure. These results indicate that each of the Eph receptor SAM domains can fold, independent of the intact receptor. Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to evaluate the oligomeric state of the three isolated Eph receptor SAM domains (Table I). At concentrations up to 300 μm, each Eph-SAM is a monomer in solution. At higher concentrations, EphB2-SAM showed a small concentration-dependent increase in its average molecular weight, e.g. at 24,000 rpm the molecular weight increased from 9220 at 0.77 mg/ml to 9760 at 3.0 mg/ml. There was also a small decrease in molecular weight on increasing rotor speed, as would be expected if some molecular weight heterogeneity were present. If this increase arose from a monomer-dimer equilibrium, it would correspond to a dissociation constant of approximately 6 mm. This is comparable to the results of Stapleton et al. (16Stapleton D. Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), who estimated the dissociation constant for the EphA4-SAM dimer to be 0.5–5 mm. Thus, none of the Eph receptor SAM domains show a strong tendency to self-associate in solution.Table IEquilibrium sedimentation of EphA2-SAM, EphB1-SAM, and EphB2-SAMSAMM rcalcCM r24KM r30Kmg/mlEphA292330.66816080201.9080807860EphB189640.90933091002.8090808840EphB293940.77922088803.009760NM Open table in a new tab Although we had previously solved the structure of the human EphB2-SAM domain with seleno-methionine incorporated (27Thanos C.D. Goodwill K.E. Bowie J.U. Science. 1999; 283: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we also obtained crystals of the natural protein in a different space group. Given the large structural differences in the subunit interactions observed so far, we were interested in comparing the structures in alternate crystal forms. The new crystals belong to the space group P43212 with unit cell parametersa = b = 54.837 Å, c = 65.545 Å. There was one molecule in the asymmetric unit. An initial structure was obtained by molecular replacement, using the previously determined human EphB2-SAM structure as a search model, and refined using the CNS software package to a final R freeof 26.4 (Table II) (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

The new EphB2-SAM structure, shown in Fig. 2, is quite similar to the previously determined structure. The polypeptide chain starts with a stretch of irregular structure, the N-terminal peptide arm (residues 8–13), and enters the core of the domain beginning with helix 1 (residues 14–20). The chain then reverses direction into helix 2 (residues 27–32). A long loop then wraps around the domain and contains a single turn of helix 3 (residues 38–41). After the loop region, the chain enters helix 4 (residues 46–52) and then takes a sharp turn into the long C-terminal helix 5 (residues 57–78). In contrast to the previously solved structures of Eph receptor SAM domains, no extensive interfaces were made between molecules in the crystal. Thus, we believe the new structure represents the monomeric form of the EphB2-SAM domain. To distinguish the current structure and the earlier EphB2-SAM structure, we will refer to the current structure as mEphB2-SAM (monomeric) and the previously determined structure as oEphB2-SAM (oligomeric). To compare the mEphB2-SAM structure with the previously determined SAM domain structures, the coordinates were superimposed (Fig. 3) (37Satow Y. Cohen G. Padlan E. Davies D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The mEphB2-SAM matches the structure of the previously determined Eph-SAM and p73-SAM structures quite closely for most of the residues. The mEphB2-SAM can be aligned with the oEphB2-SAM with an overall root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.)1 on Cα positions of 0.65 Å to the EphA4-SAM with an r.m.s.d. of 1.1 Å and to the p73-SAM with an r.m.s.d. of 1.47 Å. The close correspondence of the monomeric and oligomeric Eph receptor SAM domain structures indicates that no large global conformational changes in the core of the SAM domains are found upon oligomerization in the crystal environment. As shown in Fig. 4, however, there are significant deviations at the N- and C-terminal ends, which are involved in intermolecular contacts in previously determined structures.FIG. 4Cα coordinate deviations in the superimposed SAM structures. The Cα coordinates of the mEphB2-SAM structure were optimally aligned with the oEphB2-SAM, EphA4-SAM, and Ets-1-SAM structures. The distance between Cα coordinates after superposition is plotted as a function of residue number. The three comparisons shown are: a, mEphB2-SAM and oEphB2-SAM; b, mEphB2-SAM and EphA4-SAM; andc, mEphB2-SAM and Ets-1-SAM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The mEphB2-SAM structure shows a much larger overall deviation of 2.6-Å r.m.s.d. from the more distantly related Ets-1-SAM structure. Three substantial structural differences occur between the Eph receptor SAMs and the Ets-1-SAM (16Stapleton D. Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 26Slupsky C.M. Gentile L.N. Donaldson L.W. Mackereth C.D. Seidel J.J. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12129-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Thanos C.D. Goodwill K.E. Bowie J.U. Science. 1999; 283: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). First, as diagrammed in Fig. 5, helix 1 is much longer in the Ets-1-SAM. This helix is 7 residues long in EphB2-SAM (residues 14–20) and 14 residues long in Ets-1 (residues 46–59). Second, helix 2 in EphB2-SAM is replaced by a long loop in the Ets-1 SAM structure (Fig. 5). This loop in EphB2-SAM is 12 residues long (residues 62–73). Finally, the N-terminal peptide that extends out in the Eph receptor SAM structures instead folds back into the core of the domain in the Ets-1-SAM structure. Thus the N-terminal region may play a structural role in the Ets-1-SAM domain. Although the overall folds of all five SAM structures are similar, the structural comparison displayed in Fig. 3 highlights the presence of large conformational differences in N-terminal peptide arms (residues 6–13 in the EphB2-SAM structure). In the mEphB2-SAM structure, the arm is completely solvent-exposed and has relatively high temperature factors (average B = 84.14 Å2). The N-terminal arm in p73-SAM is also solvent-exposed (28Chi S.W. Ayed A. Arrowsmith C.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4438-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, one of the conserved hydrophobic residues in the SAM domain family is in the N-terminal peptide arm (1Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This position corresponds to Tyr-8 in the mEphB2-SAM structure. Usually, conservation of hydrophobicity at a position indicates that the residue is part of the hydrophobic core (39Bowie J.U. Reidhaar-Olson J.F. Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 247: 1306-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The fact that conserved residue Tyr-8 is not part of the hydrophobic core in EphB2-SAM suggests that it may be conserved for functional reasons. To examine whether Tyr-8 is involved in the folding and stability of the monomeric protein, we prepared a Y8A-mutant EphB2-SAM domain. The CD spectrum of the Y8A mutant is shown in Fig. 1. The ellipticity of Y8A mutant spectrum at 208 nm corresponds to a helical content of about 56%. Although the helical content of the Y8A mutant is slightly lower than the wild-type EphB2-SAM domain, it clearly must be substantially folded. Thermal melting of both EphB2-SAM variants was fully reversible, and the melting curves are shown in Fig. 6. For the wild-type EphB2-SAM we found aT m of 69 °C, whereas the Y8A mutant had aT m of 68 °C. At 68 °C, the difference in unfolding free energy is only 0.2 kcal/mol. The reduced helical content in the CD spectrum of Y8A and the slight reduction in stability indicate that Tyr-8 may partially fold back into the SAM domain as seen in the Ets-1-SAM structure. Nevertheless, the contribution to stability is much less than would be expected for such a large alteration in hydrophobic core residue (40Eriksson A.E. Baase W.A. Zhang X.J. Heinz D.W. Blaber M. Baldwin E.P. Matthews B.W. Science. 1992; 255: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that the SAM domain from the EphB2 receptor contains a flexible N-terminal arm that does not play a role in the tertiary structure of the protein. The conserved residue Tyr-8 is not an important structural residue. The presence of a conserved hydrophobic position in this part of the protein that does not contribute to protein stability (Tyr-8) implies that the N-terminal arm may have a functional role. This role remains to be determined. In the previously solved Eph receptor SAM domain structures, the N-terminal arm is involved in intersubunit contacts. The conserved hydrophobic position (Tyr-8 in EphB2-SAM and Phe-910 in EphA4-SAM) is anchored in a conserved hydrophobic cleft on the surface of a neighboring subunit. In these structures, Tyr-8 and Phe-910 bury the most surface area in the arm-exchange interfaces (not shown). Interestingly, the position analogous to Tyr-8 and Phe-910 in the PcG protein ph is a Trp, and when mutated to Ala, binding to other PcG-SAMs is abolished (12Kyba M. Brock H. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Together these results suggest a functional role of the N-terminal peptide arm in SAM domain oligomerization. Enthusiasm for the previously described models of SAM domain quaternary structure must be tempered in view of the weak associations of SAM domains seen in solution. It remains possible that Eph-SAM oligomerization is entropically favored by association with the bilayer (29Remy I. Wilson I.A. Michnick S.W. Science. 1999; 283: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Alternatively, receptor clustering imparted by the binding of ephrin (23Stein E. Cerretti D. Schoekcklmann H. Schroff A. Van Etten R. Daniel T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) or other proteins (22Torres R. Firestein B.L. Dong H. Staudinger J. Olson E.N. Huganir R.L. Bredt D.S. Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1453-1463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) could provide the driving force for oligomerization. Nevertheless, in the absence of further experiments, the functional role of the N-terminal arm in Eph receptor signaling cannot be assigned. While this paper was in press, the solution structure of another EphB2-SAM domain was reported (Smalla, M., Schmieder, P., Kelly, M., Ter Laak, A., Krause, G., Ball, L., Wahl, M., Bork, P., and Oschkinat, H. (1999) Protein Sci. 8,1954–1961). Concentration-dependent resonance shifts are consistent with an arm-exchange type dimer interface."

This residue is an in vivo and in vitro substrate for PKA, but another kinase is likely to be responsible for its phosphorylation in response to carbachol stimulation. Phosphorylation of serine 916 is necessary but not sufficient for maximal activation of Ras-GRF1.DISCUSSIONThis study identifies serine 916 of the Ras-GRF1 exchange factor as a target for phosphorylation in vivo in COS-7 cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts in response to both the activation of co-expressed muscarinic receptors and the activation of PKA. Mutation of serine 916 to alanine prevents full activation of the exchange activity of Ras-GRF1 toward Ras. Clearly, however, phosphorylation at serine 916 does not provide a complete explanation of the activation of Ras-GRF1 by G-protein-coupled receptors because it is not, by itself, sufficient to replicate this activation. It is likely that there are additional sites at which phosphorylation occurs in response to agonist stimulation and these events are also required for activation. The absence of these further phosphorylation events would explain the absence of activation in response to forskolin, which may be only able to induce phosphorylation at serine 916. Evidence that there are indeed increases in phosphorylation in response to carbachol at sites that are not so stimulated by forskolin is shown in Fig. 6. Whether phosphorylation at serine 916 in response to a cAMP/PKA signal may contribute to the overall regulation of Ras-GRF1 activity in the cell is unknown, but it is possible that this could provide an additional point of cross-talk between the cAMP and Ras signaling systems (36Bourne H.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Ras-GRF1 is expressed exclusively in the neurons of the postnatal central nervous system in rodents (10Zippel R. Gnesutta N.

It is reasonable to question, therefore, whether the results from the COS-7 and NIH-3T3 model systems reflect a mechanism that is relevant to physiological events in neuronal signaling. We have previously shown that Ras-GRF1 in neonatal rat brains is a phosphoprotein, the phosphorylation state of which is increased in response to the muscarinic agonist carbachol, and that carbachol increases the exchange activity toward Ras that is present in lysates of rat brains (18Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Whether serine 916 of Ras-GRF1 is also a site for phosphorylation in neurons remains, however, to be determined. It should also be noted that Ras-GRF1 may be expressed more widely in human tissues than in rodents (39Guerrero C. Rojas J.M. Chedid M. Esteban L.M. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Font de Mora J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) is highly homologous to Ras-GRF1, with much of the difference being short insertion sequences that are present only in Ras-GRF1. These insertions produce the larger size of 140 kDa for Ras-GRF1 rather than 135 kDa for Ras-GRF2. Both Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 bind calmodulin through their ilimaquinone domains and can couple ionomycin-induced increases in cytosolic calcium into increased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (20Farnsworth C.L.

It is striking, therefore, that serine 916 of Ras-GRF1 occurs within one of the insert regions and so has no homologous residue in Ras-GRF2. Serine 916 and the adjacent residues are, however, fully conserved between Ras-GRF1 from rodents and humans (5Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A.

Because I have found that phosphorylation of serine 916 plays a functional role in the activation of Ras-GRF1 by muscarinic receptors, it will be interesting to test whether Ras-GRF2 is regulated in a similar manner.Serine 916 lies N-terminal to the CDC25 domain in Ras-GRF1 that has the exchange factor activity for Ras (42Coccetti P. Mauri I. Alberghina L. Martegani E. Parmeggiani A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 206: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and is just C-terminal to PEST sequences that confer sensitivity, at least in vitro, to proteolysis (43Baouz S. Jacquet E.

This region of Ras-GRF2 contains a cyclin destruction box (40Fam N.P. Fan W.T. Wang Z. Zhang L.J. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation may be a signal for protein turnover (44Wulczyn F.G. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1724-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and because this region of Ras-GRF1 may be concerned with regulation of protein stability, it is possible that phosphorylation of serine 916 also plays a role in the termination of signaling through induced down-regulation of Ras-GRF1.Another distinction between Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 had been that I 2R.

Koch C.A. deHoog C.L. Fam N.P. Moran M.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 935-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, however, Kiyono et al. (48Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Rac exchange factor activity can be induced in Ras-GRF1 by the co-expression of G-protein βγ subunits. The DBL and plekstrin homology domains that mediate Rac exchange factor activity (48Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) are also required for the regulation of the Ras exchange activity of Ras-GRF1 in response to ionomycin (45Freshney N.W. Goonesekera S.D. Feig L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This result suggests that control of these two activities may be closely linked. Further, the induction of Rac exchange activity by Gβγ is also associated with an increase in the phosphorylation state of Ras-GRF1, although in this case the event is likely to be phosphotyrosine (48Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We previously showed that Gβγ induced an increase in the Ras exchange activity of Ras-GRF1 (18Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and this led to the identification of the serine 916 phosphorylation site in this study. In view of the close parallels between the control of the Ras and Rac exchange activities of Ras-GRF1, it is possible that phosphorylation at serine 916 may also participate in the control of Rac exchange activity.An overall picture of the regulation of Ras-GRF1 is still, therefore, incomplete. Indeed, many GEFs for Ras superfamily GTPases are subject to complex regulation through phosphorylation (49Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Buchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). GEFs may also play a role in the selection of targets for their substrate GTPases (53Giglione C. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34737-34744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the case of Ras-GRF1 and its activation by ionomycin, there is now evidence that it can participate in the activation of Raf, the Ras effector, through a mechanism that may be independent of further activation of Ras (46Anborgh P.H. Qian X. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. DeClue J.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4611-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is likely that these complexities reflect the underlying function of Ras-GRF1 and other GEFs to serve as key integrators and controllers of signaling pathways with activities beyond the simple control of GTP binding to their substrates. The Ras GTPases are known to play central roles in pathways of cellular growth and differentiation (1Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar). Their function in terminally differentiated cells such as neurons is less clear, but they have been suggested to participate in learning and memory (2Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). As timed, molecular switches they cycle between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) conformations under the control of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 and GTPase-activating proteins (3Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). The balance of the effective GEF and GTPase-activating protein activities determines the activation state of Ras proteins. Regulation of the activity or subcellular localization of a specific GEF is now recognized as the major control for Ras activity in many instances (4Downward J. Nature. 1998; 396: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Ras-GRF1 exchange factor (5Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which was also previously known as CDC25Mm (6Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell.

Denis-Donini S. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mice that lack the expression of Ras-GRF1 have defects in the consolidation of memory (12Brambilla R.

The latter may be due to a decrease in circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 levels that is secondary to changes in the hypothalamus (13Itier J.-M. Tremp G.L. Leonard J.-F. Multon M.-C. Ret G.

Further, regulation through Sos occurs by translocation of the GEF from the cytosol to its substrate, Ras, at the plasma membrane (21Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), whereas Ras-GRF1 has not been found to undergo obvious subcellular redistribution (22Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.-B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, for example, stimulate an increase in the phosphorylation state of Ras-GRF1 that is closely associated with an increase in its exchange activity toward Ras (18Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).

Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We previously showed that Gβγ induced an increase in the Ras exchange activity of Ras-GRF1 (18Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and this led to the identification of the serine 916 phosphorylation site in this study. In view of the close parallels between the control of the Ras and Rac exchange activities of Ras-GRF1, it is possible that phosphorylation at serine 916 may also participate in the control of Rac exchange activity.An overall picture of the regulation of Ras-GRF1 is still, therefore, incomplete. Indeed, many GEFs for Ras superfamily GTPases are subject to complex regulation through phosphorylation (49Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Buchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). GEFs may also play a role in the selection of targets for their substrate GTPases (53Giglione C. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34737-34744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the case of Ras-GRF1 and its activation by ionomycin, there is now evidence that it can participate in the activation of Raf, the Ras effector, through a mechanism that may be independent of further activation of Ras (46Anborgh P.H. Qian X. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. DeClue J.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4611-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is likely that these complexities reflect the underlying function of Ras-GRF1 and other GEFs to serve as key integrators and controllers of signaling pathways with activities beyond the simple control of GTP binding to their substrates. This study identifies serine 916 of the Ras-GRF1 exchange factor as a target for phosphorylation in vivo in COS-7 cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts in response to both the activation of co-expressed muscarinic receptors and the activation of PKA. Mutation of serine 916 to alanine prevents full activation of the exchange activity of Ras-GRF1 toward Ras. Clearly, however, phosphorylation at serine 916 does not provide a complete explanation of the activation of Ras-GRF1 by G-protein-coupled receptors because it is not, by itself, sufficient to replicate this activation. It is likely that there are additional sites at which phosphorylation occurs in response to agonist stimulation and these events are also required for activation. The absence of these further phosphorylation events would explain the absence of activation in response to forskolin, which may be only able to induce phosphorylation at serine 916. Evidence that there are indeed increases in phosphorylation in response to carbachol at sites that are not so stimulated by forskolin is shown in Fig. 6. Whether phosphorylation at serine 916 in response to a cAMP/PKA signal may contribute to the overall regulation of Ras-GRF1 activity in the cell is unknown, but it is possible that this could provide an additional point of cross-talk between the cAMP and Ras signaling systems (36Bourne H.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ras-GRF1 is expressed exclusively in the neurons of the postnatal central nervous system in rodents (10Zippel R. Gnesutta N. Matus-Leibovitch N. Mancinelli E. Saya D. Vogel Z. Sturani E. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 48: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), where, based on the phenotypes of knockout mice that apparently lack expression of Ras-GRF1 (12Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herron C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Grant S.G.N. Chapman P.F. Lipp H.-P. Sturani E. Klein R.

BioEssays. 1998; 20: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 38Orban P.C. Chapman P.F. Brambilla R. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 38-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to question, therefore, whether the results from the COS-7 and NIH-3T3 model systems reflect a mechanism that is relevant to physiological events in neuronal signaling. We have previously shown that Ras-GRF1 in neonatal rat brains is a phosphoprotein, the phosphorylation state of which is increased in response to the muscarinic agonist carbachol, and that carbachol increases the exchange activity toward Ras that is present in lysates of rat brains (18Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Whether serine 916 of Ras-GRF1 is also a site for phosphorylation in neurons remains, however, to be determined. It should also be noted that Ras-GRF1 may be expressed more widely in human tissues than in rodents (39Guerrero C. Rojas J.M. Chedid M. Esteban L.M. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Font de Mora J. Santos E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1097-1107PubMed Google Scholar). The Ras-GRF2 exchange factor (40Fam N.P. Fan W.T. Wang Z. Zhang L.J. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) is highly homologous to Ras-GRF1, with much of the difference being short insertion sequences that are present only in Ras-GRF1. These insertions produce the larger size of 140 kDa for Ras-GRF1 rather than 135 kDa for Ras-GRF2. Both Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 bind calmodulin through their ilimaquinone domains and can couple ionomycin-induced increases in cytosolic calcium into increased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (20Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 40Fam N.P. Fan W.T. Wang Z. Zhang L.J. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is striking, therefore, that serine 916 of Ras-GRF1 occurs within one of the insert regions and so has no homologous residue in Ras-GRF2. Serine 916 and the adjacent residues are, however, fully conserved between Ras-GRF1 from rodents and humans (5Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell.

Because I have found that phosphorylation of serine 916 plays a functional role in the activation of Ras-GRF1 by muscarinic receptors, it will be interesting to test whether Ras-GRF2 is regulated in a similar manner. Serine 916 lies N-terminal to the CDC25 domain in Ras-GRF1 that has the exchange factor activity for Ras (42Coccetti P. Mauri I. Alberghina L. Martegani E. Parmeggiani A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 206: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and is just C-terminal to PEST sequences that confer sensitivity, at least in vitro, to proteolysis (43Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This region of Ras-GRF2 contains a cyclin destruction box (40Fam N.P. Fan W.T. Wang Z. Zhang L.J. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation may be a signal for protein turnover (44Wulczyn F.G. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1724-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and because this region of Ras-GRF1 may be concerned with regulation of protein stability, it is possible that phosphorylation of serine 916 also plays a role in the termination of signaling through induced down-regulation of Ras-GRF1. Another distinction between Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 had been that I 2R. R. Mattingly, unpublished results. and others (45Freshney N.W. Goonesekera S.D. Feig L.A.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4611-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) had not found any exchange activity toward GTPases of the Rho family in Ras-GRF1, whereas Ras-GRF2 has clear exchange activity for Rac (47Fan W.T. Koch C.A. deHoog C.L. Fam N.P. Moran M.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 935-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, however, Kiyono et al. (48Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Rac exchange factor activity can be induced in Ras-GRF1 by the co-expression of G-protein βγ subunits. The DBL and plekstrin homology domains that mediate Rac exchange factor activity (48Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) are also required for the regulation of the Ras exchange activity of Ras-GRF1 in response to ionomycin (45Freshney N.W. Goonesekera S.D. Feig L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This result suggests that control of these two activities may be closely linked. Further, the induction of Rac exchange activity by Gβγ is also associated with an increase in the phosphorylation state of Ras-GRF1, although in this case the event is likely to be phosphotyrosine (48Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We previously showed that Gβγ induced an increase in the Ras exchange activity of Ras-GRF1 (18Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G.

In view of the close parallels between the control of the Ras and Rac exchange activities of Ras-GRF1, it is possible that phosphorylation at serine 916 may also participate in the control of Rac exchange activity. An overall picture of the regulation of Ras-GRF1 is still, therefore, incomplete.

In particular, heme may regulate the expression of a number of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins that participate in regulatory mechanisms involving the orchestration of changes in mitochondrial biogenesis in response to different metabolic conditions (5Grivell L.A.

ALAS is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that exists as homodimer in the mitochondrial matrix, where it catalyzes the formation of δ-aminolevulinic acid by condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA (9Kappas A.

In vertebrates, ALAS is encoded by two different genes (10Riddle R.D. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One gene (alas2 or alas-E) encodes two isoforms generated by alternative splicing that are expressed exclusively in erythroid cells, where they are required for the synthesis of hemoglobin (12Conboy J.G.

Heme also inhibits the transport of ALAS1 to mitochondria (19Hayashi N. Watanabe N. Kikuchi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), probably through the heme response motif located in the amino-terminal region of the protein (4Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Transcription of thealas2 gene does not respond to changes in heme concentration, but it is developmentally regulated (both isoforms in parallel) during erythroid differentiation, probably by erythroid-specific transcription factors such as GATA-1 or NFE-2 (20Cox T.C. Bawden M.J. Martin A. May B.K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). At the post-transcriptional level, the translation of thealas2 mRNA is controlled by the iron content of the cell through the iron response element located in the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA (21Gray N.K.

Similar to ALAS1, heme also regulates the transport to mitochondria of the ALAS2 isoforms via the heme response motif.Because the majority of the studies on the alas genes have been carried out in liver and erythroid cells of vertebrates, very little is known about the mechanisms controlling the expression of the housekeeping gene in order to supply the necessary heme for the respiratory complexes (1Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and coordinate the synthesis of hemocytochromes with the respiratory demand of the different tissues (24Moyes C.D. Battersby B.J. Leary S.C. J.

In yeast, heme functions as a sensor of oxygen tension, and its level regulates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function, modulating the activity of the transcription factor HAP1, the only regulatory protein responding to heme that is well characterized in eukaryotic cells (32Zhang L.

As a first step to study the mechanisms controlling heme synthesis and its coordination with mitochondrial biogenesis, we have cloned a Drosophila melanogaster alas gene. In this paper, we describe the structure of this single copy gene, its spatio-temporal pattern of expression during development and the characterization of its proximal promoter region.DISCUSSIONWe have cloned and studied a Drosophila gene encoding the mitochondrial matrix enzyme δ-aminolevulinate synthase, which catalyzes the major regulatory step in the heme biosynthetic pathway. In animals, the enzyme has been characterized in vertebrates, mainly in mammals, which contain three ALAS isoforms encoded by two distinct genes. alas1 is expressed ubiquitously, and alas2is expressed exclusively in erythroid cells. This is the first report of an invertebrate alas gene.The D. melanogaster alas gene is located on the right arm of the second chromosome, spans a region of approximately 3 kb, and contains two exons interrupted by a single intron of 144 bp that is located at a position 375 bp from the 3′-end. In contrast to the situation in vertebrates, several experiments suggest thatDrosophila ALAS is encoded by a single gene: repetitive screenings of several cDNA and genomic libraries recovered phages harboring DNAs corresponding to the same genomic region; Southern analyses under low stringency conditions detected only fragments from this DNA region; and Northern analyses revealed the presence of a single mRNA in embryos and adults. More importantly, immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal antibody raised against the complete ALAS protein detected a single band corresponding to the predicted mature protein. The logical interpretation of these results is that theDrosophila alas gene encodes the constitutive form of the enzyme. Accordingly, the 5′-UTR of the mRNA does not contain the iron response element, a characteristic feature of the erythroid ALAS isoform in vertebrates, that is absent in the housekeeping isoform. Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with the respiratory mechanism of the fly, since oxygen reaches the cells directly through the tracheolar network without the need of respiratory pigments (53Wigglesworth V.B. The Principles of Insect Physiology. Chapman and Hall, London1970: 411-475Google Scholar). In this regard, it would be interesting to determine if other invertebrates that transport oxygen by hemoproteins contain one or twoalas genes.The D. melanogaster alas gene has a TATA-less promoter with two major transcriptional start sites located at positions −60 and −84. During embryogenesis, the −84 initiation site is used preferentially, while adult mRNAs start predominantly at the −60-position. This raises the interesting possibility that the expression of the gene is regulated differentially in embryos and adults. In addition, the Drosophila alas promoter contains a DPE located in the 5′-UTR. DPEs substitute for the TATA-box to provide a binding site for TFIID and have been found recently to interact with TAFII60 (54Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). They are conserved betweenDrosophila and humans and are critical for the function of a subset of TATA-less promoters (55Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 56Arkhipova I.R. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Using transient transfection analysis in Schneider cells, we have characterized the 5′ upstream region of the Drosophila alasgene. We have delimited the region responsible to direct maximal activity in Schneider cells to the proximal 238 nucleotides. In particular, the nucleotides encompassing the −238 to −117 region are necessary to recover full promoter activity. Within this region, we have identified several putative transcription factor binding sites and in particular one located at position −140 potentially recognized by P3A2. Notably, P3A2 is a regulatory protein identified in sea urchin that is itself developmentally regulated (51Calzone F.J. Hoog C. Teplow D.B. Cutting A.E. Zeller R.W. Britten R.J. Davidson E.H. Development. 1991; 112: 335-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Hoog C. Calzone F.J. Cutting A.E. Britten R.J. Davidson E.H. Development. 1991; 112: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar) and contains a DNA-binding domain that shares high identity with theDrosophila ERECT WING and the mammalian NRF-1 factors (29Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). NRF1 is probably involved in a coordinated response of genes encoding key components of energy metabolism (29Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 57Scarpulla R.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), including ALAS (28Braidotti G. Borthwick I.A. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1109-1117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic and molecular analyses in Drosophila have demonstrated that erect wing plays an important role in the development of muscle and the nervous system (58DeSimone S.M. White K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 59DeSimone S. Coelho C. Roy S. VijayRaghavan K. White K. Development. 1996; 122: 31-39PubMed Google Scholar), two tissues with a very high energetic requirement that demand high mitochondrial activity and therefore require elevated synthesis of respiratory pigments.ALAS activity is subject to a variety of heme-mediated negative control mechanisms including the inhibition of mRNA synthesis (11May B.K. Dogra S.C. Sadlon T.J. Bhasker C.R. Cox T.C. Bottomley S.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which is one of the few examples of a feedback mechanism by end product at the level of transcription (2Padmanaban G. Venkateswar V. Rangarajan P.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 492-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, this mechanism has been detected only in the gene encoding the alas housekeeping isoform, although these data are controversial (1Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have detected a substantial decrease in the activity of the Drosophila alaspromoter in Schneider cells treated with 30 μm hemin. Furthermore, we have delimited the sequence elements responsible for the heme-mediated inhibitory effect to a DNA fragment of 117 bp that includes 60 bp of the proximal core promoter and the 5′-UTR. Although we cannot rule out formally the possibility that the 5′-UTR mediates a decrease in mRNA stability of the luciferase transcript, the most likely interpretation is that the heme effect is exerted at the level of transcription and is mediated by the proximal 5′ upstream sequences and/or the UTR. Remarkably, the 117-bp fragment confers a heme response on heterologous promoters. Moreover, heme exerts a negative effect on the interaction of regulatory proteins and/or factors of the basal transcriptional machinery with the alas gene, blocking the binding of these proteins to the proximal 5′ upstream region of the gene.This inhibitory mechanism is different from that described for other genes that are transcriptionally regulated by heme. For example, in yeast, heme also acts as an important regulator of gene expression (60Forsburg S.L. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated, at least in some genes, by the zinc finger transcription factor HAP-1, which binds DNA in the presence of heme (61Haldi M.L. Guarente L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 62Zhang L. Guarente L. Genetics. 1994; 136: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of DNA regulatory proteins that bind the promoter of the mammalian ferritin gene in a heme-dependent manner has also been described recently, and in this case the effect is mediated by the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y (47Marziali G. Perrotti E. Ilari R. Testa U. Coccia E.M. Battistini A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 63Coccia E.M. Profita V. Fiorucci G. Romeo G. Affabris E. Testa U. Hentze M.W. Battistini A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3015-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 64Coccia E.M. Stellacci E. Orsatti R. Testa U. Battistini A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1570-1579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another example of a gene regulated at the transcriptional level by heme is the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. This effect is mediated by the interaction of a heterogeneous complex composed of Ku antigen, the redox factor protein Ref1 and a 133-kDa protein with a GAGGC tandem repeated motif (65Reddy S.V. Alcantara O. Roodman G.D. Boldt D.H. Blood. 1996; 88: 2288-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 66Reddy S.V. Alcantara O. Boldt D.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the heat shock factor 1 mediates the transcription of the gene hsp70 mediated by heme; in this case, the mechanism could be indirect, involving the inhibition by heme of intracellular proteolysis (67Yoshima T. Yura T. Yanagi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25466-25471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Vertebrate alas genes have been studied mainly in liver and cell culture. The characterization of the Drosophila alasgene has allowed us to study the spatio-temporal pattern of expression of an alas gene during development. alas mRNA of maternal origin is homogeneously distributed in the syncytial blastoderm at relatively high levels, and, consistent with Northern analyses, its concentration decreases rapidly and it is almost absent in cellular blastoderm. Interestingly, in later stages of embryogenesis after retraction of the germ band, the mRNA is expressed highly in oenocytes and in two symmetrical groups of cells located in the anterior part of the embryo. Oenocytes are a small group of cells of ectodermal origin, located in each of the abdominal segments that contain histoblasts (68Martinez-Arias A. Bate M. Martinez Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 517-608Google Scholar). Their development is associated with the differentiation of fat cells, and some of the oenocytes invade the larval fat body and are found in its inner surface. Adult oenocytes are smaller than the larval ones and are clearly recognizable and distinct from the fat body cells (69Demerec M. Biology of Drosophila. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Some observations have suggested a potential role in secretion, although their function remains largely unknown. The specific pattern of expression of alas in oenocytes suggests that these cells are highly active in the synthesis of hemoproteins, perhaps cytochrome P450, and may be involved in detoxification mechanisms in Drosophila. Heme serves as the redox prosthetic group of respiratory cytochromes and other hemoproteins including oxygen carrier proteins. It also plays an important role in cellular homeostasis, participating in the regulation of many biological processes, such as transcription, translation, and protein translocation (1Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Padmanaban G. Venkateswar V. Rangarajan P.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 492-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 4Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In particular, heme may regulate the expression of a number of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins that participate in regulatory mechanisms involving the orchestration of changes in mitochondrial biogenesis in response to different metabolic conditions (5Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 477-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 6Lenka N. Vijayasarathy C. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 309-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). δ-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS1; succinyl-CoA:glycineC-succinyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.37) is the first enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway in animals (1Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7May B.K. Borthwick I.A. Srivastava G. Pirola B.A. Elliott W.H. Curr. Top.

ALAS is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that exists as homodimer in the mitochondrial matrix, where it catalyzes the formation of δ-aminolevulinic acid by condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA (9Kappas A. Sassa S. Galbraith R.A. Nordmann Y. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2.103-2.160Google Scholar). In vertebrates, ALAS is encoded by two different genes (10Riddle R.D. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) that have been isolated and characterized in several organisms, including humans (11May B.K. Dogra S.C. Sadlon T.J. Bhasker C.R. Cox T.C. Bottomley S.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). One gene (alas2 or alas-E) encodes two isoforms generated by alternative splicing that are expressed exclusively in erythroid cells, where they are required for the synthesis of hemoglobin (12Conboy J.G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7013-7028Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The second gene (alas1 oralas-N) encodes the nonspecific or housekeeping isoform and is expressed in all cell types (including erythroid) with the highest level found in liver (7May B.K. Borthwick I.A. Srivastava G. Pirola B.A. Elliott W.H. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1986; 28: 233-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Ferreira G.C. Gong J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), where it is required for the synthesis of cytochromes P450. The expression of ALAS is regulated in vertebrates by a variety of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that are different for each gene (1Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of alas1 is elevated in liver after treatment with porphyrogenic drugs (7May B.K. Borthwick I.A. Srivastava G.

Heme also inhibits the transport of ALAS1 to mitochondria (19Hayashi N. Watanabe N. Kikuchi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), probably through the heme response motif located in the amino-terminal region of the protein (4Lathrop J.T. Timko M.P. Science. 1993; 259: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Transcription of thealas2 gene does not respond to changes in heme concentration, but it is developmentally regulated (both isoforms in parallel) during erythroid differentiation, probably by erythroid-specific transcription factors such as GATA-1 or NFE-2 (20Cox T.C. Bawden M.J. Martin A. May B.K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). At the post-transcriptional level, the translation of thealas2 mRNA is controlled by the iron content of the cell through the iron response element located in the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA (21Gray N.K. Pantopoulous K. Dandekar T. Ackrell B.A. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Science. 1988; 240: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), a regulatory mechanism that is not present in the housekeeping gene. Similar to ALAS1, heme also regulates the transport to mitochondria of the ALAS2 isoforms via the heme response motif. Because the majority of the studies on the alas genes have been carried out in liver and erythroid cells of vertebrates, very little is known about the mechanisms controlling the expression of the housekeeping gene in order to supply the necessary heme for the respiratory complexes (1Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and coordinate the synthesis of hemocytochromes with the respiratory demand of the different tissues (24Moyes C.D. Battersby B.J. Leary S.C. J.

Localization of the endogenous GLUT4 and expressed GLUT4-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein in intact 3T3L1 adipocytes demonstrated that at 23 °C there was a time-dependent accumulation of discrete GLUT4-containing vesicles adjacent to the inner face of the cell surface membrane but that was not contiguous and/or physically incorporated into the plasma membrane. Together, these data demonstrate that the temperature-dependent decrease in the rate of GLUT4 and IRAP translocation results from a reduction in GLUT4/IRAP-containing vesicle fusion and not trafficking or docking to the plasma membrane.

This primarily results from an insulin-dependent translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter isoform (GLUT4) from an intracellular vesicular storage site(s) to the plasma membrane (1Martin S.

In addition, these GLUT4-containing vesicular compartments are also enriched for another cargo protein termed IRAP (insulin-responsiveamino peptidase) (3Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.Y.

Although the molecular mechanism and signaling cascade(s) regulating the intracellular trafficking of GLUT4/IRAP-containing vesicles have not been completely elucidated, these events have several features in common with the regulated exocytotic pathway for neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles (8Rea S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In this process, protein complexes in the vesicle compartment (vesicle SNAREs) pair with their cognate receptor complexes at the target membrane (target SNAREs), resulting in the formation of a stable core complex capable of inducing membrane fusion (10Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 11Bennett M.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Goda Y.

It is generally thought that the function of various SNARE-associated accessory proteins provide for the necessary trafficking and regulated fusion specificity. In the case of GLUT4/IRAP-containing vesicles, the syntaxin4-SNAP23 complex appears to function as the required target SNARE, whereas VAMP2 is the predominant vesicle SNARE for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 vesicle docking and fusion (13Araki S.

Based upon this paradigm, the insulin-stimulated translocation of the GLUT4/IRAP-containing compartments must necessarily require the trafficking of these vesicles to the cell surface, subsequent to docking to and ultimate fusion with the plasma membrane. Therefore, to visualize these discrete steps in the GLUT4/IRAP translocation process, we compared the temporal relationship between GLUT4/IRAP translocation in isolated plasma membranes sheets with intact cell subcellular localization at 23 °C versus 37 °C. The data presented in this manuscript demonstrate that insulin stimulation of 3T3L1 adipocytes at 23 °C results in an accumulation of these vesicular compartments beneath the plasma membrane, which subsequently fuses slowly with the plasma membrane. Murine 3T3L1 preadipocytes were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture repository and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose and 10% calf serum at 37 °C in an 8% CO2 atmosphere. Confluent cultures were induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described previously (21Elmendorf J.S. Chen D. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13289-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All studies were performed on adipocytes 8–12 days after differentiation. The fully differentiated adipocytes were electroporated (0.16 kV and 950 microfarad) with 50 μg of the EGFP-tagged plasmids as described previously (20Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S.

Following electroporation, the adipocytes were replated on glass coverslips and allowed to recover for 30–36 h before use. Prior to insulin stimulation the differentiated adipocytes were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose for 2 h at either 23 °C or 37 °C. Preparation of plasma membrane sheets from the adipocytes was performed essentially by the method of Robinson et al. (22Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13289-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Following the isolation of plasma membrane sheets, these purified membranes were either used for immunoblotting or indirect immunofluorescence. For immunoblotting, the sheets were directly scraped into 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and an aliquot was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis, the amount of protein in each sample was assessed by silver staining (Silver Stain Plus Kit; Bio-Rad) and quantitated by NIH Image Analysis. The normalized samples were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with a polyclonal rabbit Clathrin heavy chain antibody (Transduction Laboratories), polyclonal rabbit IRAP/VP165 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Steven Waters, Metabolex, Inc.), and polyclonal rabbit GLUT4 antibody. For confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, the plasma membrane sheets were fixed for 20 min at 4 °C in a solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 70 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm EGTA as described previously (21Elmendorf J.S. Chen D. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13289-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The membrane sheets were then incubated for 60 min at 25 °C with a 1:100 dilution of polyclonal rabbit GLUT4 antibody followed by incubation with a 1:50 dilution of lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Jackson Immunoresearch Inc.) for 60 min at 25 °C. Control and insulin-stimulated 3T3L1 adipocytes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),1 pH 7.45, and were fixed and permeabilized for 10 min in ice-cold PBS containing 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 0.18% Triton X-100. After three rinses with room temperature PBS, the cells were blocked for 60 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 5% donkey serum (Sigma). The blocked cells were incubated for 60 min with 1:250–1:500 dilutions of affinity-purified rabbit GLUT4 antibody. The cells were then washed for 30 min with PBS (six changes of PBS) and incubated for 60 min with a 1:250 dilution of lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Inc.). Following incubation with the secondary antibodies, the cells were washed for 30 min with PBS (six changes of PBS) and mounted for microscopic analysis with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Cells intended for examination of EGFP-tagged proteins were fixed and mounted as described above. To delineate the plasma membrane, the cell surface was labeled as essentially described by Oatey et al. (23Oatey P.B. Van Weering D.H. Dobson S.P. Gould G.W. Tavare J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-6-[biotinamido] hexanoate (Pierce) in ice-cold PBS for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. This and all subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. The cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min and then incubated in a 1:100 dilution of Texas Red-avidin (Vector Laboratories Inc.) in bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. After extensive washing in PBS, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Confocal images were obtained on a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser confocal microscope and a Zeiss LSM 510 laser confocal microscope (University of Iowa Central Microscopy Research Facility). It has been well documented that the transfer of protein cargo from one membrane compartment to another requires the trafficking, docking, and fusion of carrier vesicles with the appropriate target membrane (10Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 11Bennett M.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Goda Y.

The rate of these transport steps are highly temperature sensitive and can be either reduced or fully inhibited depending upon specific incubation conditions (24Babia T. Kok J.W. van der Haar M.

In particular, incubation of adipocytes below 19 °C has been shown to completely prevent insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (29Robinson L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E383-E393PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially evaluated various conditions that would substantially reduce the rates of these processes to potentially resolve the distinct trafficking steps in GLUT4 translocation. Consistent with previous studies, we observed that at temperatures below 23 °C, there was a complete inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (data not shown). However, as observed in Fig. 1, the time-dependent increase in GLUT4 plasma membrane appearance following insulin stimulation at 23 °C (Fig. 1 A,panels 1, 3, 5, 7,9, and 11) was markedly slowed compared with that at 37 °C (Fig. 1 A, panels 2, 4,6, 8, 10, and 12). Similarly, the rate of insulin-stimulated IRAP translocation was also reduced at 23 °C (Fig. 2 A,panels 1, 3, 5, 7,9, and 11) in comparison to 3T3L1 adipocytes maintained at 37 °C (Fig. 2 B, panels 2,4, 6, 8, 10, and12). Although the rate of insulin-stimulated translocation appeared to be reduced, the total extent of GLUT4 and IRAP protein incorporated into the plasma membrane sheets appeared to be similar as visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. To better quantify these findings, the isolated plasma membrane fraction was subjected to GLUT4 and IRAP immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B and2 B). In excellent agreement with the immunofluorescence analysis, the rate but not the extent of GLUT4 and IRAP protein translocation to the plasma membrane was decreased at 23 °C compared with 37 °C. Quantitation of these data indicated that thet 12 for GLUT4/IRAP translocation was ∼4 min at 37 °C and increased to a t 12 of ∼30 min at 23 °C.FIG. 2Reduced temperature decreases the rate but not extent of insulin-stimulated IRAP translocation. 3T3L1 adipocytes were pre-equilibrated at 23 °C or 37 °C for 2 h in serum-free medium. The cells were then treated in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for the times indicated. Plasma membrane sheets were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subjected to IRAP immunofluorescence microscopy (A). The plasma membrane sheets were also detergent solubilized and subjected to Western blot analysis for IRAP (B). These are representative experiments independently performed three to six times. IF, immunofluorescence;IB, immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) There are several possible mechanisms that could account for the decreased rate of insulin-stimulated GLUT4/IRAP translocation at reduced temperatures. However, examination of the known proximal insulin signal transduction events including insulin receptor autophosphorylation, insulin receptor substrate protein tyrosine phosphorylation, stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, and in vivo formation of phosphaditylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate was not significantly different between 3T3L1 adipocytes maintained at 23 °Cversus 37 °C (data not shown). Because the insulin receptor signaling cascades appeared to be fully functional, we next examined the basal and insulin-stimulated cellular distribution of GLUT4 in intact cells (Fig. 3). In the basal state, GLUT4 was predominantly localized to the perinuclear region and in small vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm in cells maintained at both 23 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 3, panels 1 and 2). As expected, treatment of cells at 37 °C with insulin for 15 min resulted in a clear redistribution of GLUT4 from the intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane as depicted by the appearance of a continuous rim of cell surface immunofluorescence (Fig. 3, panel 4). In the continuous presence of insulin, the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane was persistent up 90 min (Fig. 3,panels 4, 6, and 8). In marked contrast, at 23 °C insulin stimulation for 15–30 min resulted in an accumulation of GLUT4 at the inner surface of the plasma membrane but was apparently not contiguous with the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, panels 3 and 5). This redistribution occurred concomitant with a decrease in the amount of GLUT4 localized in the perinuclear region. However, at longer times of insulin stimulation at 23 °C (90 min), the plasma membrane juxtaposed GLUT4-containing vesicles appeared to decrease concomitant with the formation of a continuous rim of cell surface immunofluorescence (Fig. 3, panel 7). This occurred without any further decrease in the amount of GLUT4 localized in the small vesicular structures scattered throughout the cell cytoplasm or in the perinuclear region. In addition to GLUT4, identical results were also observed for the insulin stimulation of IRAP at 23 °C and 37 °C (data not shown). From these data, we conclude that the insulin-stimulated trafficking (movement) of the GLUT4/IRAP-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane was not significantly affected at 23 °C compared with 37 °C but that either the docking (plasma membrane binding) or fusion (physical integration into the plasma membrane) was impaired at the lower temperature. To further examine the plasma membrane association of the GLUT4/IRAP-containing vesicles, we prepared GLUT4-EGFP and EGFP-IRAP fusion proteins to increase the resolution of these structures by confocal fluorescence microscopy. However, to ensure that the expression of these fusion proteins was localized to the appropriate intracellular compartments and underwent the same degree of insulin-stimulated translocation, we first compared the subcellular localization of the expressed GLUT4-EGFP protein with endogenous IRAP (Fig. 4 A). In the basal state, both the expressed GLUT4-EGFP and endogenous IRAP proteins were localized in small vesicular compartments and in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4 A, panels 1 and3). As expected, there was a substantial degree of co-localization as observed by the appearance of yellow in the merged image (Fig. 4 A, panel 5). Insulin stimulation resulted in the formation of cell surface GLUT4-EGFP and endogenous IRAP, again with substantial co-localization (Fig. 4 A,panels 2, 4, and 6). Similarly, expression of EGFP-IRAP resulted in an identical basal state distribution as the endogenous GLUT4 protein (Fig. 4 B,panels 1, 3, and 5). Furthermore, following insulin stimulation both the expressed EGFP-IRAP and endogenous GLUT4 displayed the identical degree of plasma membrane translocation (Fig. 4 B, panels 2, 4, and 6). Thus, these data demonstrate that both our GLUT4-EGFP and EGFP-IRAP fusion constructs are correctly localized and display the appropriate insulin-stimulated trafficking when expressed in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Having demonstrated the fidelity of these fusion proteins, we next examined the effect of temperature on the translocation of GLUT4-EGFP (Fig. 5). To more closely compare the relative distribution of the GLUT4/IRAP-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane, the cell surface was also subjected to biotinylation followed by strepavidin-Texas Red labeling. As previously observed for endogenous GLUT4 (Fig. 3), insulin stimulation for 30 min at 23 °C resulted in an accumulation of a discontinuous punctate distribution of GLUT4-EGFP beneath the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 A, panel 1). This is more clearly visualized when a segment of the plasma membrane is magnified (Fig. 5 A, panel 1,inset). In contrast, insulin stimulation for 30 min at 37 °C resulted in a continuous plasma membrane distribution of GLUT4-EGFP that was clearly incorporated into the plasma membrane as depicted by the overlap between the GLUT4-EGFP and strepavidin-Texas Red signals (Fig. 5 A, panel 2). Quantitation of the number of cells displaying these two phenotypes demonstrated that at 37 °C, there was a rapid formation of cells displaying a continuous surface labeling (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, insulin stimulation at 23 °C resulted in a large increase in the number of cells with a subplasma membrane punctate distribution that slowly converted to a smooth continuous cell surface rim fluorescence. Essentially identical results were also obtained when we examined the temperature and time dependence of insulin-stimulated EGFP-IRAP subcellular localization (data not shown). Thus, the accumulation of GLUT4/IRAP-containing vesicles beneath the cell surface at 23 °C strongly suggests that the plasma membrane fusion of these vesicles was decreased with relatively little effect on plasma membrane docking. In conclusion, we have taken advantage of reduced temperature to decrease the overall rate of insulin-stimulated GLUT4/IRAP vesicle translocation to the plasma membrane. Incubation of 3T3L1 adipocytes at 23 °C resulted in an approximate 7-fold increase in thet 12 for insulin-stimulated appearance of GLUT4/IRAP in the plasma membrane without any major effect on the extent of translocation. Importantly, reduced temperature did not have any significant effect on the activation of the insulin receptor kinase, insulin receptor substrate tyrosine phosphorylation, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation or generation and/or localization of phosphaditylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in intact 3T3L1 adipocytes. Instead, rather than a rapid insulin-stimulated plasma membrane fusion of the GLUT4/IRAP-containing vesicles, they were observed to accumulate adjacent to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Based upon the resolution limit of the confocal microscope, the average center of the GLUT4-EGFP signal appeared localized within 140 nm of the average center of the biotin-strepavidin-Texas Red signal. Although this separation should only be considered as a rough estimate, this dimension is consistent with the GLUT4/IRAP vesicles trapped in a docked state that can only then slowly integrate into the plasma membrane lipid bilayer. Thus, the simplest and most direct model accounting for these data is that insulin stimulation resulted in a normal trafficking and docking of the GLUT4/IRAP-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane at 23 °C. However, at this temperature the rate of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane was decreased accounting for the overall reduction in the time course of GLUT4/IRAP translocation and appearance of the abutting GLUT4/IRAP-containing vesicles. Although less likely, there are several alternative explanations for these observed data. For example, the apparent punctate pattern of GLUT4 accumulation beneath the cell surface may represent a clustering of vesicles in discrete plasma membrane subdomains that are inaccessible to biotin-strepavidin-Texas Red cell surface labeling. At 23 °C the fluidity of the plasma membrane or vesicle lipid bilayer may also be substantially reduced, thereby lowering the rate of protein mixing. Under such conditions, it remains possible that the GLUT4 vesicles are actually fused with the plasma membrane but have not yet undergone lateral protein diffusion. On the other hand, the accumulation of these vesicles may not actually be juxtaposed to the plasma membrane and could represent a nexus point for progression to the plasma membrane. Additional studies at the electron microscopic level are now required to provide the necessary resolution to address these issues. In any case, the ability to distinguish between GLUT4/IRAP vesicle trafficking, docking, and fusion will provide an important experimental tool to further our understanding of the mechanisms regulating GLUT4 translocation.

https://openalex.org/W2331538118,"Although USF-1 and -2 are the major proteins that bind to Myc-regulated E-box (CACGTG) elements in many cells, there is no clear role for USF during Myc-dependent gene regulation. Using dominant negative alleles of USF-1 we now show that DNA binding by USF at a Myc-regulated E-box limits the ability of another E-box binding factor, TFE-3, to activate a target gene of Myc in vivo and to stimulate S phase entry in resting fibroblasts. Similarly, dominant negative alleles of USF-1 relieve the restriction that prevents activation of the IgH enhancer by TFE-3 in non B-cells. DNA binding activity of USF complexes is abundant in primary human B-cells and is significantly downregulated during B-cell immortalization. Re-expression of USF-1 in immortalized B-cells retards proliferation. Our data establish an essential role for USF in restricting E-box dependent gene activation in vivo and suggest that this control is relaxed during cellular immortalization."

For most α subunits of the Gi family, including αi, αo, and αz, two distinct acylation events occur. N-Myristoylation takes place at the amino terminus and represents the attachment of a myristate through an amide bond to Gly2 following cleavage of the initiator methionine (5Jones T.L.Z.

The palmitoylation of G protein α subunits has drawn much attention recently, as this modification, unlike N-myristoylation, is reversible and subject to regulation. Several groups have demonstrated that the activation of Gs is accompanied by an increased rate of palmitate exchange on αs, probably reflecting depalmitoylation and repalmitoylation of the subunit released from βγ (19Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 20Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whether the exchange coincides with a release of αs from membrane is subject to debate (22Huang C. Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Agonist-promoted palmitate exchange has also been reported for αq (24Stanislaus D. Janovick J.A. Brothers S. Conn P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 738-746PubMed Google Scholar) and αi (25Bhamre S. Wang H.-Y. Friedman E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 1482-1489PubMed Google Scholar). The nature and reversibility of palmitoylation raise the expectation that it serves to regulate not only subunit location, but also activation/deactivation cycles and interactions of subunits with other proteins. The basic requirements for palmitoylation remain obscure. For α subunits of the Gi family, three interrelated phenomena appear relevant: N-myristoylation, interaction with βγ, and proximity to membrane. A widely held hypothesis is thatN-myristoylation imparts a small amount of hydrophobicity to the α subunit and/or facilitates interaction of the subunit with independently anchored βγ, therefore supporting a reversible interaction of the subunit with the plasma membrane (2Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar); at the plasma membrane, the subunit is palmitoylated either enzymatically,i.e. by a membrane-localized palmitoyltransferase (26Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), or nonenzymatically (27Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The relevance of the membrane is consistent with the observation that only membrane-associated subunits are found to be palmitoylated and that a mutant of αi that is notN-myristoylated can nevertheless be palmitoylated when apparently brought to the membrane by overexpressed βγ (28Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have not, however, addressed whether membrane association, carried out through N-myristoylation, interaction with βγ, or other events, is sufficient for palmitoylation. It is quite possible, for example, thatN-myristoylation and/or βγ is required not only prior to, but following interaction of the subunit with membrane to support additional events culminating in palmitoylation. We report here, using αo, that this is in fact the case. We found that mutants of αo that lack an N-myristoyl group but are still targeted to membrane are not palmitoylated. We also found that interactions with βγ are not normally required for palmitoylation, but, in the absence of N-myristoylation, become necessary. The requirement for βγ in lieu of N-myristoylation is not related to anchorage. We propose that N-myristoylation and βγ, while no doubt relevant to reversible interactions of subunits with membrane, also play redundant, post-anchorage roles in palmitoylation.

The mutations G2A, S6N, G204A, and Q205L and the deletion of residues 8–11 for αo were accomplished by the polymerase chain reaction using mismatched primers. The proteins αoK10, αoG2A/K10, 5-HT1AR/αo, and 5-HT1AR/αoG2A were also constructed by polymerase chain reaction techniques in which overlapping ends were subsequently combined in a second round of polymerase chain reaction. The final constructs were subcloned into the HindIII andXbaI restriction sites of pcDNA3. Sequences were verified directly. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Transfections were carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (33Lounsbury K.M. Schlegel B. Poncz M. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3494-3498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), usually with 10 μg of DNA/10-cm plate of just subconfluent cells. Cells were harvested 40–48 h thereafter. Biosynthetic labeling of proteins prior to harvesting was carried out as follows: (i) with Tran35S-label (ICN), nominally referred to as [35S]methionine, in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (50 μCi/ml), usually initiated 8 h before harvesting; (ii) with [3H]myristic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (250 μCi/ml; Sigma), usually initiated 2 h before harvesting; or (iii) with [3H]palmitic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (250 μCi/ml), usually initiated 1 h before harvesting. Cells to be fractionated into membrane and cytosolic fractions were harvested in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 ml/10-cm plate) and lysed at 0 °C by repeated passage through a 27-gauge needle. Subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 660 × g for 5 min, and the cytosolic and membrane fractions were resolved subsequently by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The cytosolic fraction was used directly for immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting. The membrane fraction was extracted in the lysis buffer described above, but containing 1% sodium cholate, followed by clarification at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. Immunoprecipitation of αo and the various mutants from the cytosolic or extracted membrane fractions was accomplished by adding an equal volume of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2% deoxycholic acid, 2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 300 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then, following pre-clearance with nonimmune rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose, adding antiserum 9072 (1:50 to 1:100 final dilution) (34Chen C.A. Manning D.R. Manning D.R. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1999: 99-121Google Scholar); antiserum 9072 was generated against the C-terminal 10 residues of αo1. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation; washed three times in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA; and resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). When fractionation was not required, cells were harvested directly in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 ml/10-cm plate). After 30 min on ice, the lysate was processed for immunoprecipitation as described above. The detergent-free approach of Song et al. (13Song K.S. Sargiacomo M. Galbiati F. Parenti M. Lisanti M.P. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 292-303Google Scholar) was used to prepare caveolin-enriched membrane fractions. HEK293 cells in 10-cm dishes were harvested in 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11; passed through a 27-gauge needle 25 times; and then processed in a Polytron tissue grinder with three 10-s bursts and a sonicator (550 Sonic Dismembraner, Fisher) with three 20-s bursts. The homogenate was adjusted to 45% sucrose by addition of 2 ml of 90% sucrose in 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, and 150 mm NaCl and placed in a 14 × 95-mm Ultra ClearTM centrifuge tube (Beckman Instruments). Four ml of 35% sucrose in the same buffer were layered above the sample, followed by 4 ml of 5% sucrose also in the same buffer. Centrifugation was performed at 39,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C in an SW 41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). One-ml fractions were collected, and the protein within each fraction was precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10% at 4 °C. The precipitates were collected, washed, and dissolved in sample buffer for analysis by Western blotting. Antiserum 9072 was used for detection of αo, and caveolin was detected with an antiserum raised to the N terminus (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Discontinuous SDS-PAGE (11% acrylamide) was carried out as described (34Chen C.A. Manning D.R. Manning D.R. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1999: 99-121Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, destained, and dried. For fluorography, the gels were soaked in AmplifyTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min prior to drying. Dried gels were exposed to HyperfilmTM MP film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −80 °C for 20–40 days (fluorography) or at room temperature for 4–10 days (autoradiography). Western blotting using chemiluminescence was accomplished following the directions provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. GTPγS protection of the α subunit from tryptic digestion was performed according to Berlot and Bourne (35Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin (PTX)-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was conducted by the method of Carty (36Carty D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The [35S]GTPγS-binding assay was carried out according to Windh et al. (37Windh R.T. Lee M.-J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J.

The observation that mutation of Gly2 (a residue that composes part of a consensus sequence for N-myristoylation) in αi subunits abolishes palmitoylation as well as N-myristoylation (20Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2800-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,38Hallak H. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 303: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) has led to the hypothesis that N-myristoylation, as a cotranslational modification, is a prerequisite to palmitoylation, a post-translational modification. To more firmly establish the relationship between N-myristoylation and palmitoylation, we initiated studies with another mutation, S6N, using αoexpressed in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells lack αo and therefore provide a suitable setting for the analysis of heterologously expressed αo and mutants of αo. Ser6, like Gly2, is a consensus element forN-myristoylation (40Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knnoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 41Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding αo, αoG2A, and αoS6N and then incubated with [35S]methionine, [3H]myristate, or [3H]palmitate. The cells were subsequently fractionated into membrane and cytosol, and the subunits were immunoprecipitated from each fraction with an αo-directed antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel), αo cofractionated mostly with membrane, whereas αoG2A and αoS6N were found mostly in cytosol. As expected, αo incorporated both [3H]myristate (middle panel) and [3H]palmitate (lower panel), whereas αoG2A incorporated neither; incorporation of [3H]palmitate by αo was evident only in the membrane fraction. αoS6N, like αoG2A, did not incorporate either [3H]myristate or [3H]palmitate. Mutational approaches are subject to the criticism that a mutation, while inhibiting N-myristoylation, might also have a direct bearing on nonenzymatic palmitoylation or substrate recognition by a palmitoyltransferase apart from N-myristoylation. We therefore studied the effects of a chemical inhibitor ofN-myristoyltransferase, 2-hydroxymyristic acid (2-HMA) (42Paige L.A. Zheng G. DeFrees S.A. Cassady J.M. Geahlen R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,43Nadler M.J.S. Harrison M.L. Ashendel C.L. Cassady J.M. Geahlen R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9250-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Treatment of αo-transfected cells with 1 mm 2-HMA for 16 h caused a redistribution of about half of αo to cytosol (data not shown); correlated with this effect was an ∼70% decrease in incorporation of [3H]myristate and [3H]palmitate. Although the suppression was not complete, the effects were consistent with the translocation data. In separate experiments, we began to address the role of βγ and conformational states of αo in palmitoylation. We first evaluated [3H]palmitate labeling of αoG204A and αoQ205L. αoG204A corresponds to αsG226A and αi1G203A, which are refractory to activation and bind βγ with an especially high affinity (44Lee E. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1212-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ueda N. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). αoQ205L, like other Gln-to-Leu mutants, assumes a predominantly active conformation. The levels of expression of αo, αoG204A, and αoQ205L in transfected HEK293 cells were similar (Fig. 2, upper and lowermost panels), and fractionation revealed little difference among these subunits in partitioning between membrane and cytosol (upper panel). Experiments with [3H]palmitate were performed at several times of incubation to confirm that steady-state levels of labeling had been attained. The labeling of αoG204A with [3H]palmitate, regardless of incubation time, was considerably stronger than that of αo, whereas that of αoQ205L was almost undetectable (middle panel). Because the G204A and Q205L mutants associate with membrane nearly equivalently, these data suggest that labeling with [3H]palmitate is sensitive to events beyond overt changes in interactions of subunit with membrane. Labeling with [3H]myristate, as a control, was the same for the three subunits (data not shown). A small proportion of αoG2A and αoS6N usually cofractionates with membrane (see Fig. 1, for example). This can be the result of nonspecific association due to subunit denaturation; however, we found that GTPγS protects this population of subunit from degradation by trypsin, allowing only the 2-kDa (N-terminal) clip characteristic of a conformationally sound subunit (data not shown). Because αoG2A and αoS6N that cofractionate with the membrane do not incorporate [3H]palmitate, as noted previously, we hypothesized that the absence of an N-myristoyl group and possibly a consequent decrease in affinity of the subunits for βγ might be the underlying defect. We therefore determined whether the G204A mutation, which would increase the affinity of the α subunit for βγ, would confer to the G2A and S6N forms of αothe capacity to be palmitoylated. We found that introduction of the G204A mutation did not change the distribution of αoG2A and αoS6N between membrane and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3, upper panel). However, although αoG2A and αoS6N did not incorporate [3H]palmitate, αoG2A/G204A and αoS6N/G204A did (lower panel). The results lend support to the concept that events in addition to membrane attachment are required for [3H]palmitate labeling, and they specifically demonstrate that a non-myristoylated form of subunit can be palmitoylated if made to assume a conformation more refractory to activation and/or more conducive to interaction with βγ. The extent of labeling in the case of αoG2A/G204A and αoS6N/G204A was severalfold less than that achieved with wild-type αo (data not shown), due probably to the relatively greater amount of the latter associated with membrane. We evaluated the capacity of αo and the various mutants to be [32P]ADP-ribosylated by PTX, a reaction that requires at least a transient interaction of the α subunit with βγ (46Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Kanaho Y. Hewlett E.L. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15320-15323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Neer E.J. Lok J.M. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). αoG204A, as expected based on its presumed high affinity for βγ, was a better substrate for ADP-ribosylation than αo (Fig. 4 A). αoQ205L was also a good substrate, which was surprising, as an active form of the subunit would not be expected to interact well with βγ. The ADP-ribosylation of Gln-to-Leu mutants expressed in mammalian cells has not been evaluated previously. αoG2A and αoS6N were not substrates for ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 4 B), a result consistent with the observation that theN-myristoyl group is relevant to interaction with βγ (14Linder M.E. Pang I.-H. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of the G204A mutation restored the capacity of αoG2A and αoS6N to be ADP-ribosylated, as it did the capacity of these subunits to be palmitoylated. The extent of ADP-ribosylation was less for αoS6N/G204A than for αoG2A/G204A, which might be explained by a greater impact of the S6N mutation on interactions with βγ. The results with the G2A and S6N mutants imply that the loss of [3H]palmitate labeling observed when the N-myristoyl group is absent can be reversed by G204A through an enhanced interaction with βγ. The above observations suggest a role for βγ in palmitoylation. To begin addressing this role in more detail, we constructed a mutant of αo previously noted to associate only poorly with βγ (48Denker B.M. Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6272-6277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant, αoΔ8–11 (lacking Glu8–Ala11), was, as expected, a poor substrate for PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 5 A). The mutant behaved nearly identically to αo in terms of membrane/cytosol distribution and [3H]myristate and [3H]palmitate labeling (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, whereas a mutation enhancing interaction of αo with βγ enhanced [3H]palmitate labeling (G204A; see above), a mutation attenuating interaction but maintainingN-myristoylation and membrane anchorage (αoΔ8–11) had no effect. This result indicates that [3H]palmitate labeling of αo does not require fully normal interactions of αo with βγ. We wished to corroborate this result and therefore devised a mutant in which 10 lysine residues were inserted between Ser6 and Ala7 (αoK10). We anticipated (and examined subsequently below) that the 10-lysine insertion, like αoΔ8–11, would disrupt interaction of the subunit with βγ. The 10-lysine insert was also chosen to permit a set of experiments with αoG2A to confirm the role ofN-myristoylation in palmitoylation for even the membrane-attached subunit, as suggested by the G2A and S6N mutants. Polylysine domains support the attachment of various proteins to membrane, probably by virtue of electrostatic interactions with phospholipids (49Sigal C.T. Zhou W. Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Resh M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12253-12257Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 50Kwong J. Lublin D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The 10-lysine insert did not affect the folding of αo or αoG2A as evaluated by GTPγS protection from tryptic digestion (data not shown). Consistent with previous experiments, ∼80% of αo cofractionated with membranes, whereas most but not all of αoG2A cofractionated with cytosol (Fig. 6 A). The 10-lysine insert increased the affinity of both αo and αoG2A for membrane, i.e. almost all of αoK10 and approximately one-half of αoG2A/K10 cofractionated with membrane. Radiolabeling with fatty acids revealed that αo and αoK10 incorporated [3H]myristate and [3H]palmitate (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, the 10-lysine insert, which is predicted to disrupt normal interactions of αo with βγ, was not deleterious to N-myristoylation or palmitoylation. This result suggests, again, that normal interactions with βγ are not required for αo to be palmitoylated. In the case of the G2A mutant, however, the 10-lysine insert did not restore the capacity of the subunit (αoG2A/K10) to be palmitoylated, despite the large fraction of subunit targeted to membrane. This result confirms a requirement forN-myristoylation in palmitoylation despite membrane attachment. The failure of the 10-lysine insert to rescue palmitoylation of αoG2A might have resulted from incorrect targeting of the subunit. Caveolae are specialized plasma membrane domains that represent a major storage or reaction site for molecules involved in G protein-coupled signal transduction pathways, including G protein α and βγ subunits (13Song K.S.

The process of conjugal DNA transfer is cell-cell contact-dependent and resembles in this and other respects the type III and type IV toxin export systems of pathogenic bacteria (5Zechner E.L. de la Cruz F.

Harwood Academic Publishers, London1999: 87-173Google Scholar). The transfer of the plasmid DNA occurs via an initial strand and site-specific cleavage at the origin of transfer (oriT), specifically at a site termed nic, followed by unwinding and transfer of single-stranded DNA through a cell-envelope bound transport complex. The plasmid DNA is replicated within the donor as well as in the recipient cell. Finally, the cells actively separate from each other. One of the key steps in conjugation is the formation of a nucleo-protein complex in the donor cell prior to the actual DNA transfer process. This complex has been termed relaxosome (4Lanka E. Wilkins B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 141-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and comprises several proteins as well as the plasmid DNA region aroundoriT. The relaxosome is a specialized pre-replication complex in which all elements necessary for the initiation of DNA replication are present. Whereas the relaxosome is well characterized in several cases (4Lanka E. Wilkins B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 141-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the signals and/or processes that convert the pre-replication complex into an active replication and transfer machinery remain elusive. One plasmid-encoded protein that participates in the formation of the relaxosome of the F-like resistance plasmid R1 is the TraM protein (6Schwab M. Gruber H. Högenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,7Kupelwieser G. Schwab M. Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Zechner E.L. J. Mol.

Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The protein is encoded by the traM gene which maps next to the oriT region. Transcription of traM is initiated at two promoters that partially overlap oriT (9Koronakis V.E. Bauer E. Högenauer G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 3: 79-86Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By using translational traM′-′lacZgene fusions, it was shown that the expression of traM is negatively autoregulated (8Pölzleitner E. Zechner E.L. Renner W. Fratte R. Jauk B. Högenauer G.

Microbiol. 1993; 7: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Negative autoregulation is contributed by the TraM protein itself, which has been demonstrated to bind to two rather large DNA stretches within the oriTregion (approximately 60 and 100 base pairs, respectively) by DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting (6Schwab M.

Biol. 1998; 275: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence suggests that TraM has at least three functions in conjugation of F-like plasmids: i) it serves as a positive control element for transfer gene expression (8Pölzleitner E. Zechner E.L. Renner W. Fratte R. Jauk B. Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); ii) it participates in the formation of the R1 relaxosome where it stimulates TraI-catalyzed cleavage at the transfer origin in vivo (7Kupelwieser G. Schwab M. Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Zechner E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); iii) TraM couples the relaxosome to the envelope-bound transport complex via its interaction with the inner membrane protein TraD (13Disque-Kochem C. Dreiseikelmann B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6133-6137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The multifunctionality of the small 14-kDa TraM protein and its essential role in conjugation prompted us to further characterize the biophysical and biochemical properties of the TraM protein. We used the purified protein and two mutant variants of TraM which have been characterized previously in vivo (7Kupelwieser G. Schwab M. Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Zechner E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Pölzleitner E. Zechner E.L. Renner W. Fratte R. Jauk B. Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In in vitro analyses, we mainly focused on the questions of which oligomerization state TraM acquires in solution or when bound to its DNA target site and which domains of the protein are responsible for dimer and tetramer formation. Since recent NMR data on the structure of a synthetic peptide consisting of 22 N-terminal amino acids of TraM (amino acids 1–22) showed a high degree of flexibility in aqueous solution (12Plugariu C. Stockner T. Moskau D. Koraimann G. Sterk H. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 51: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we also wished to determine a possible conformational change in TraM upon DNA binding. The TraM proteins were overexpressed from Escherichia coli cells harboring the plasmids pExtraM, pExtraMM13, or pExtraMM26. In these constructs thetraM and traM mutant genes are under the control of the λ PR promoter. The plasmids also contain the gene for the temperature-sensitive λ repressor (cI857) which allows temperature-controlled protein expression. The expression plasmids were constructed by cloning a EcoRI -PstI fragment with the λ repressor and traMgenes from plasmid pKL5 (6Schwab M. Gruber H. Högenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI -PstI cut pUC119 (14Balbas P. Soberon X. Merino E. Zurita M. Lomeli H. Valle F. Flores N. Bolivar F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1986; 50: 3-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) vector plasmid. The resulting plasmid was designated pExtraM. For pExtraMM13 and pExtraMM26, the XbaI -PstI fragment from pExtraM containing only traMwas exchanged against the corresponding mutated fragments from plasmids pBR111M13 and pBR111M26 (8Pölzleitner E. Zechner E.L. Renner W. Fratte R. Jauk B. Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), respectively. The correct sequence of thetraM cassettes in the resulting expression constructs was verified by DNA-sequencing. As an expression host strain, the Lon-protease-deficient E. coli strain UG10 (lon::Tn10, hsdR,hsdM+, tre, thi, lac,rpsL) was used. Best expression of TraM and TraM mutants was obtained by growing 5-ml precultures overnight at 30 °C, followed by inoculation of 500 ml of 2× TY medium (16 g of Tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl per liter). The cultures were then grown at 37.4–38.2 °C for 18 to 20 h. The given temperature range was essential for successful expression of the proteins. Selective antibiotics were present at the following concentrations: 100 μg/ml epicillin (dihydroampicillin); 15 μg/ml tetracycline. After incubation, the cells were harvested and broken using a French pressure cell. The cytoplasmic fractions were obtained by centrifugation and the TraM proteins further purified in consecutive chromatography steps. TraM wild-type (WT)1 protein and mutant TraMM13 were purified using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in three steps (6Schwab M. Gruber H. Högenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The cytoplasmic extract was loaded onto a 10-ml fast flow S-Sepharose cation ion-exchanger column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 50 mm Trisphosphate, pH 6.8, as loading buffer. The fractions containing TraM or TraMM13 were loaded onto a Mono-Q HR 5/5 anion ion-exchanger column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for equilibration. The last purification step was carried out on a Mono-S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under the same conditions as in step 1. The proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient and concentrated between each chromatography step by ultrafiltration (Amicon). TraM was eluted from the S-Sepharose column with 130–200 mm NaCl, from the Mono-Q with 260–450 mm and from the Mono-S with 100–200 mm NaCl. TraMM13 was eluted with similar NaCl concentrations. TraMM26 was purified in a two-step purification scheme. TraMM26 was enriched from the soluble fraction of a crude cell lysate by loading the extract onto a 10-ml S-Sepharose fast flow cation ion-exchanger column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 50 mmTrisphosphate, pH 6.8, as starting buffer. TraMM26 was eluted between 70 mm and 110 mm NaCl. The second step was a gel filtration step on a 125-ml Superose 12 prep grade column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 50 mmNaH2PO4/H3PO4 buffer, pH 4.0. Between the two steps, the fractions containing TraMM26 were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon). Samples of the soluble fractions of the crude extracts and the purified proteins were analyzed on a 20% homogenous Phast gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TraM WT concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy using a molar extinction coefficient of ε = 5180 m−1cm−1 for the denatured protein and ε = 5355m−1 cm−1 for the native protein, respectively (15Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Alternatively, protein concentrations were determined using protein determination dye kits (Sigma Diagnostics; Bio-Rad) (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used in this study represent a part of sbmA, one of the binding regions for TraM in the oriT region of plasmid R1(6). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer by the solid-phase phosphoramidite method. Dimethoxytrityl-bearing fragments were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Sephasil peptide C8 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the volatile buffer triethanolammonium acetate, pH 6.7, with an acetonitrile gradient. After evaporation, the oily residue was resolved in MilliQ water and the DNA precipitated using EtOH/NaCl. The oligonucleotides were dissolved in annealing buffer (5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), completely denatured (95 °C), and annealed by slowly cooling to room temperature. The concentrations were determined via UV-spectroscopy. SBM1a, 5′-tGTGAATCGCATATGATTCAC-3′; and SBM1aRev, 5′-tGTGAATCATATGCGATTCAC-3′. The annealed oligonucleotides consist of two pseudopalindromic binding motifs (half-sites; underlined) arranged as inverted repeats: The oligonucleotides represent one complete binding site (full-site) for TraM. SBM1loop, 5′-TGGTGAATCGCATATGATTCACGaacaaCGTGAATCATATGCGATTCACCA-3′, is able to form a double strand (ds) hairpin structure (single strand loop sequence in lowercase letters) containing a complete binding site (full-site). SBM1loop2, 5′-TTGGTGAATCa CATATGATTCACcGaacaaCgGTGAATCATATGtGATTCACCAA-3′, forms a ds hairpin. Some bases (bold lowercase letters) of the original binding sequence on the plasmid R1 were exchanged to create a binding site (full-site) which contains two consensus half-sites (TGA(A/T)TCA) for the TraM protein. Determination of the molecular weight of the purified TraM proteins in solution was carried out under physiological conditions (50 mm Na-phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) on a Superose-12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 130 μg of purified TraM protein, TraMM13 or TraMM26, with a concentration of 0.7 μg/μl were loaded onto the column and eluted with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. TraM protein was also loaded at a lower concentration (0.3 μg/μl). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), β-lactoglobulin, cytochrome c, aprotinin (150 μg each), and vitamin B12 (15 μg) were used for calibration. TraMM26 was analyzed in a 50 mm Na-phosphate, pH 4.0, buffer which was also used in the second purification step. Chemical cross-linking of the TraM monomers using glutaraldehyde was carried out as follows. Purified TraM protein samples (0.5 mg/ml) were preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm Bicine-NaOH, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. To this mixture, various concentrations of glutaraldehyde (freshly diluted from an aqueous 8% stock solution) were added, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 methanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 140 mm. After incubation at room temperature for another 5 min, the proteins were precipitated with 400 μl of cold acetone for 2 h at −20 °C. The samples were centrifuged, dissolved in loading buffer, and heated for 3 min at 95 °C prior to analysis on a 20% homogenous SDS-polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) run in the Phast system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 5′-[γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide SBM1loop was purified by reversed-phase chromatography, completely denatured, and re-annealed using the following incubation temperatures: 2 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 60 °C, 2 min at 58 °C, 2 min at 56 °C, 2 min at 54 °C, and 10 min at 50 °C. The sample was then loaded onto a 4% agarose gel (MetaPhor, FMC). DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide and UV trans-illumination. The band corresponding to the hairpin structure of the SBM1loop oligonucleotide was extracted from the gel by electroelution and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The purified and 5′-[γ-32P]ATP labeled oligonucleotide SBM1loop (0.85 nm) was incubated with various amounts of purified TraM, TraMM13, or TraMM26 for 15 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing 12 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 15 μl. 3 μg of BSA and 1 μg of salmon-sperm DNA as nonspecific competitor DNA were added to the reaction. After incubation, the samples were immediately loaded onto an 8% PAGE and electrophoresed in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer under nondenaturing conditions. The radioactive DNA and TraM-DNA complexes were visualized and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The processed data were fit using the Origin software (MicroCal, Inc.) and a one site binding model under the assumption that preformed tetramers of TraM bind to the labeled oligonucleotide. The K a values were determined according to Equation 1, fD=[P]Kd+[P](Eq. 1) where f D represents the fraction of the shifted DNA, [P] the total protein concentration, andK d the dissociation constant for the binding reaction. For the determination of the stoichiometry of the TraM-DNA interaction, the oligonucleotide SBM1loop was purified as described above except that extraction from the agarose gel was done by a freeze-squeeze method according to protocol of the manufacturer (FMC). The gel slice was frozen overnight at −70 °C and then thawed and subsequently centrifuged for 15 min. The supernatant was collected. To increase the yield, some microliters of 0.1× Tris-EDTA were added to the slurry, and the procedure was repeated. The supernatants containing the oligonucleotide were precipitated with 4 m LiCl. The concentrations of oligonucleotide and proteins were determined by UV spectroscopy. The oligonucleotide SBM1loop (340 nm) was incubated with various amounts of purified TraM in the same buffer as described for the EMSA with the labeled oligonucleotide. No competitor DNA was added to the reaction. After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, 1 μl of 0.12% xylencyanol was added, and the mixture was loaded onto a 3.5% agarose gel (MetaPhor, FMC). Subsequently, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. In a similar experiment, TraM protein (1680 nm) was incubated with various amounts of SBM1loop. A stock solution of TraM protein in 25 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, was incubated at 20 °C with various amounts of SDS or with the oligonucleotide SBM1a. The solutions were centrifuged and filtered through a 0.2-μm AnatopTM 25Plus filter (Merck). The final protein concentration was 2 mg/ml (1.4 × 10−4m) in buffer with 0.3% SDS, 0.05% SDS or with 3.5 × 10−5m dsDNA, respectively. The laboratory-built goniometer was equipped with an Argon+laser (Spectra Physics, model 2060–5S, P max = 5 watts, λ = 514.5 nm), single mode fiber detection and ALV-5000/E correlator with fast expansion (ALV Germany). Measurements were carried out at a scattering angle of 90° at a temperature of 20 °C and a laser power of 200 milliwatts. The time dependence of the scattering intensity, represented by its correlation function, provided information on diffusional motion of the scatterers. Correlation functions from repeated experiments (typically 10 per sample over 5 min) were averaged. The diffusion coefficient D, determined from the correlation function, is related to the apparent hydrodynamic radius RH by the Stokes-Einstein equation,i.e. an equivalent sphere with the radiusRH shows the same diffusion behavior as the particle under investigation and serves as a size parameter. A polydisperse system gives rise to a correlation function with a spectrum of different decay constants. Laplace inversion of the correlation function results in the intensity-weighted size distribution D(RH) (17Schnablegger H. Glatter O. Appl. Optics. 1991; 30: 4889-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The extrinsic fluorescence probe 1,8-ANS was purchased from Sigma. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorimeter, and measurements were obtained with both excitation and emission slit width set at 10 nm. A 1 × 1 cm quartz cuvette with a sample volume of 1 ml was used for all experiments. The sample was equilibrated at 20 °C and stirred during measurement to reduce photobleaching. Preliminary experiments proved that ANS binds to the TraM protein, giving an increase in intensity and a blue shift in the fluorescence spectrum. In further investigations, the displacement of ANS from the protein because of the addition of DNA could be shown. Preliminary experiments yielded optimized measurement conditions for the competition assay. The ANS stock solution was chosen to be 1 mm (ε = 5500m−1 cm−1) in 10 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (the effective concentration in the cell for the competition assay was 100 μm). The DNA concentrations were chosen to be 1 × 10−7 to 5 × 10−8m, the protein concentration varied in the range from 10−5 to 10−6m. The optimal excitation and emission wavelengths were determined to be 370 and 483 nm, respectively. DNA/ANS competition assays were conducted by titrating 5-μl aliquots of TraM stock solution to 1 ml of ANS or ANS/DNA solution. The protein concentration was chosen to reach a stoichiometry of 10:1 of TraM monomer to DNA. Because pairs of titrations (with and without DNA) were conducted under identical conditions, no corrections for buffer base line or dilution were necessary. Data from the two corresponding titration experiments were subtracted and the DNA binding curves analyzed by assuming a bimolecular reaction. The stoichiometry of binding was determined from the observed data as the point of intersection of the initial linear range of the titration with the horizontal line defined by the maximal signal. Then the binding constant KA is determined according to Equation 2, KA=fD(1−fD)2Dtot(Eq. 2) where fD is the fraction of bound DNA at the stoichiometric point, and D tot is the total DNA concentration used in the titration experiment (18Carpenter M.L. Kneale G.G. Kneale G.G. Methods in Molecular Biology. 30. Humana Press Inc., Totawa, NJ1994: 313-325Google Scholar, 19Kelly R.C. Jensen D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7240-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DSC measurements were performed using a MicroCal VP calorimeter. Protein solutions were extensively dialyzed against a 10 mmKH2PO4/KOH, pH 7.5, buffer. The same dialysis buffer was used in the reference cell. The concentration of the TraM protein was 0.5 mg/ml (3.5 × 10−5m) and 0.75 mg/ml for the experiments with a heating rate of 1 °C/min and 0.5 °C/min, respectively. All scans were conducted in a series of measurements to reduce artifacts because of thermal history of the instrument. Samples were degassed prior to measurements, and scans were performed from 20–85 °C. For each of the samples (buffer, protein) repeated scans were performed to check reversibility of the denaturation. Data analysis was performed with the Origin software (MicroCal, Inc.), involving subtraction of buffer base line and defining a progress-base line for the native and heat-denatured state. The processed data were fit to a model for a non-two-state transition (Equations 3 and 4), Cp(T)=K(T)ΔHvΔH(1+K(T))2RT2(Eq. 3) K(T)=expΔHvRT1−TTm(Eq. 4) to determine the transition temperatureTm, the calorimetric heat change ΔHand the Van't Hoff heat change ΔHv . CD measurements were performed in 10 mm KH2PO4/KOH, pH 7.5, buffer with a protein concentration of 3.5 × 10−5m and a DNA concentration of 8.7×10−6m SBM1loop in the complex solution. The investigations were carried out on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter using a 0.05-cm pathlength cell equilibrated at 20 °C. Protein and complex spectra were base line-corrected by subtracting buffer and DNA spectra, respectively. For the heat-denaturation experiment, the sample cell was heated to 66 °C with a heat rate of 2 °C/min, and the thermal equilibration was awaited. Because of a temperature lag between the cell and the thermostatting device, the actual sample temperatures were determined directly in the cell using a miniature thermocouple probe from Newport Electronics. Mean residue ellipticity [Θ] was calculated as specified in the data analysis program provided by Jasco (mean residue weight 113.6 g/mol). For the in vitro analyses, three forms of the TraM protein were chosen: the TraM WT protein, TraMM13, and TraMM26. TraMM13 is a mutant TraM protein with amino acid exchanges SIST(37–40) to ATAS(37–40). The mutant protein neither affects the autoregulatory ability nor stimulation of transfer origin cleavage by TraI (7Kupelwieser G. Schwab M. Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Zechner E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Pölzleitner E. Zechner E.L. Renner W. Fratte R. Jauk B. Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the mutant protein does affect transfer gene expression, which is dramatically reduced, as well as the conjugation frequency, which is reduced by three orders of magnitude (8Pölzleitner E. Zechner E.L. Renner W. Fratte R. Jauk B. Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, only the function of TraM in controlling transfer gene expression but not the function of TraM as a relaxosomal component is impaired in the case of TraMM13. TraMM26 is a C-terminal deletion variant of TraM retaining only the first 56 amino acids. Despite the presence of the N-terminal DNA binding and recognition domain, TraMM26 is a loss-of-function mutant in all testable TraM features (7Kupelwieser G. Schwab M. Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Zechner E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Pölzleitner E. Zechner E.L. Renner W. Fratte R. Jauk B. Högenauer G. Koraimann G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The TraM proteins described above were overexpressed fromE. coli cells harboring the traM expression plasmids pExtraM, pExtraMM13, or pExtraMM26. In these constructs thetraM and traM mutant genes are under the control of the bacteriophage λ PR promoter. The cytoplasmic fractions were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” yielding >98% pure protein as estimated by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The identities of the expressed and purified TraM proteins were verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The analysis revealed that the first methionine is not present in the mature TraM WT protein. The same situation was encountered with the TraMM13 and TraMM26 proteins. Thus the mature TraM and TraMM13 protein species consist of 126 amino acids (amino acids 2–127), the TraMM26 mutant form is 55 amino acids in length (amino acids 2–56). The calculated molecular masses of the purified proteins correspond well to the values measured by the MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. The measured values were 14,314 Da for TraM (14,315 calculated), 14,253 Da for TraMM13 (14,257 calculated), and 6,280 Da for TraMM26 (6,280 calculated). The quarternary structures of the purified TraM proteins were investigated in a first approach by size-exclusion chromatography. The resulting chromatogram and a calibration curve, which was used to determine the approximate mol"

After initial phosphorylation of GCV by HSV-1 TK, cellular kinases generate the toxic GCV-triphosphate metabolite that is incorporated into DNA and eventually leads to tumor cell death. The cellular and pharmacological mechanisms by which metabolites of GCV lead to cell death are still poorly defined. To begin to address these mechanisms, different mutated forms of HSV-1 TK at residue Gln-125 that have distinct substrate properties were expressed in mammalian cell lines.

The major difference between the two enzymes was the lack of deoxypyrimidine metabolism in the Asn-125 TK-expressing cells. In HCT-116 cells expressing the Glu-125 TK mutant, GCV metabolism was greatly attenuated, yet at higher GCV concentrations, cell sensitivity to the drug and bystander effect killing were diminished but still effective.

In response to GCV phosphorylation and/or metabolite transfer, most cell types have been reported to undergo apoptosis, which appears to be the cellular mechanism by which both the HSV-1 TK-expressing cells and bystander cells ultimately die (5Rubsam L.Z.

In vivo, it is clear that initial HSV-1 TK/GCV tumor cell killing results in a complex inflammatory stimulation of the immune system that affects all tumor cells (1Freeman S.M. Whartenby K.A.

Regression of tumors distant from the primary HSV-1 TK-expressing site and establishment of anti-tumor immunity has also been demonstrated, and this has been termed the distant bystander effect (22Bi W.

All of the effects of GCV metabolites must somehow be linked to their incorporation into DNA and the disruption of the cell cycle, which in many cell systems results in induction of apoptosis, yet these links are still not clear. It is apparent, however, that phosphorylation of GCV by HSV-1 TK leads to a broad range of diverse pharmacological, cellular, and physiological effects in vitro and in vivo. Optimizing these effects and understanding the biochemical mechanism by which GCV acts could lead to improved therapeutic and clinical outcomes for genetic therapies of cancer utilizing HSV-1 TK. A separate study has described the characterization of the enzymatic properties and cell killing properties of three site-specific mutations of Gln-125 in HSV-1 TK to Asp, Asn, or Glu. 2T. A. Hinds, C. Compadre, B. K. Hurlburt, and R. R. Drake, submitted for publication. 2T. A. Hinds, C. Compadre, B. K. Hurlburt, and R. R. Drake, submitted for publication. It was observed that when expressed in the human colon tumor cell line HCT-116 and treated with GCV, the Glu-125 mutant was equally effective at cell killing as the wild-type (Gln-125) or Asn-125 HSV-1 TKs. This was despite the diminished enzymatic properties of Glu-125 HSV-1 TK compared with wild-type Gln-125 TK, which included a 7-fold higherK m for GCV and a 83-fold decrease ink cat/K m .2 In this current report, further characterization of cell lines expressing these mutant HSV-1 TKs and analysis of the differences in cellular responses to GCV are evaluated. Besides determining that the Asn-125 TK enzyme acts just as efficiently as wild-type enzyme in these cell lines, we report differences in the cell cycle progression, apoptosis induction, bystander killing, and GCV dose effects of the Glu-125 TK enzyme. These studies demonstrate how cellular expression of different HSV-1 TK mutants with distinct enzymatic properties can be used to evaluate the unique pharmacological properties of GCV. A Moloney murine leukemia virus derived plasmid for the expression of HSV-1 TK, termed pLENTK, has been previously constructed (12McMasters R. Jones K.E. Saylors R.L. Hendrix E.M. Moyer M.P. Drake R.R. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A unique BspEI-MluI restriction fragment within the HSV-1 TK sequence of pLENTK contains the Gln-125 mutation site. This fragment was removed from wild-type plasmid and replaced with the analogous fragments encoding each mutant. The new pLEN-mutant TK constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation. Along with wild-type HSV-1 TK plasmid, each mutant TK plasmid was transfected individually into the murine fibroblast cell line, NIH3T3, and the human colon tumor cell line, HCT-116, using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) (2 μg of plasmid, 14 μl of lipid/1 × 106 cells). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium and selected with G418 (200 μg/ml for 2 weeks) as described previously (12McMasters R. Jones K.E. Saylors R.L. Hendrix E.M. Moyer M.P. Drake R.R. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At least eight individual G418-resistant cell clones were picked and grown up for further characterization. Each clone was screened initially for growth inhibition by 25 μm GCV. Those clones that were sensitive were further analyzed for HSV-1 TK protein expression by Western blot analysis with a polyclonal, rabbit anti-HSV-1 TK antibody (a gift from Dr. Margaret Black, Washington State University). For each clone, cell numbers were normalized to 1 × 106, and equal protein loading was confirmed for each sample by gel staining. Blotted HSV-1 TK protein bands were visualized on film using ECL chromophore reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each HSV-1 TK cell line set used was characterized for comparatively equal protein expression levels of HSV-1 TK to one another as determined by the Western blot analyses. For metabolic labeling, cells (1–2 × 106) were labeled in triplicate with 2 μCi of [3H]GCV (8 μm) for 18 h, and then nucleotides were extracted from pelleted cells in 0.2 ml of 70% methanol at 4 °C for 15 min as described previously (12McMasters R.

Saylors R.L. Chiang Y. Govindarajan R. Munshi N.C. Antiviral Res. 1997; 35: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). An aliquot of each methanol-soluble supernatant was analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. The methanol insoluble pellets, representative of a crude DNA fraction, were resuspended in 0.15 ml of water and also counted for radioactivity. For deoxypyrimidines, cells were grown to confluency in 60-cm2 plates, and either 2 μCi of [3H]thymidine (2 μm final) or 2 μCi of [3H]dC (10 μm final) were added for 1 or 2 h, respectively, prior to extraction in 70% methanol. Methanol-soluble extracts were concentrated by evaporation under nitrogen and separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates developed in 0.8 m LiCl for GCV or 0.35 m LiCl for thymidine/dC as described previously (25Drake R.R. McMasters R. Krisa S. Hume S.D. Rechtin T.M. Saylors R.L. Chiang Y. Govindarajan R. Munshi N.C. Antiviral Res. 1997; 35: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For determination of GCV sensitivity, parental HCT-116 and each HSV-1 TK-expressing cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2 × 105/well) in 1 ml of medium. The next day, 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 μm GCV was added to each cell line in triplicate. After 24 h, for each well the medium was removed, cells were rinsed twice in fresh medium and trypsinized, and then medium was added to 1 ml/well. Each well of cells was then sequentially diluted from 1:10 to 1:10,000 in 1 ml of fresh medium on a separate 24-well plate. After 7 days, surviving cell colonies were fixed in 100% methanol, stained with 0.1% methylene blue, and counted. For bystander effect assays, each of the three HSV-1 TK-expressing cell lines were plated with parental HCT-116 cells (total 2 × 105/well) in the following proportions: (parental:HSV-1 TK cells) 100%:0%, 95%:5%, 90%:10%, 75%:25%, 50%:50%, and 0%:100%. After 2 days, 25 μm GCV was added in 1 ml of fresh medium. After 24 h, the medium was removed, and cells from each well were diluted from 1:10 to 1:10,000 as described above. After 7 days, surviving cell colonies were fixed and stained for counting. Parental HCT-116 cells and each HSV-1 TK-expressing cell line were plated (5 × 104 cells/well) in 8-well plastic chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and left untreated or treated with 25 μm GCV for 36 or 84 h. At either time point, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by staining in 1 μg/ml DAPI in 100% methanol at 37 °C for 10 min (26Adam L. Crepin M. Savin C. Israel L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5156-5160PubMed Google Scholar). After rinsing, the stained cells were visualized with a DAPI-specific filter on a Zeiss fluorescent microscope at 40× magnification. Caspase 3-like activity was determined in parental HCT-116, and each HSV-1 TK-expressing cell line was treated for 50 h plus or minus 25 μm GCV using an Apo-Alert CPP32/Caspase 3 Colorimetric Assay kit with the peptide substrate, DEVD-pNA, as per manufacturers instructions (CLONTECH). GCV-treated and untreated cells were grown in 25-cm2 flasks, and cell numbers were determined using a hemocytometer prior to analysis. Assays were done in triplicate with protein extracts derived from 2 × 106 cells. The amount of Caspase 3-like activities were quantitated using a Shimadzu UV/VIS spectophotometer set at 405 nm. Parental HCT-116 cells and each HSV-1 TK-expressing cell line were grown to 60% confluency in 25-cm2 flasks and treated for 24 h plus or minus 25 μm GCV. Following drug incubation, cells were removed by trypsin, and total cell numbers were determined. The cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 1 ml of 70% ethanol at 4 °C for at least 1 day. Just prior to cell cycle analysis, the ethanol was removed and cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1% bovine serum albumin plus RNase (0.1%) and propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature to stain DNA. DNA content was measured using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and data were analyzed using MODFIT LT (Verity Software House) computer software. In a separate study, three site-specific mutations of Asp, Asn, and Gln were substituted for amino acid Gln-125 in HSV-1 TK.2 In contrast to wild-type HSV-1 TK, these mutant enzymes all displayed increased K m values for thymidine and minimal phosphorylation activities for TMP, dC, and AZT. TheK m values for GCV varied from wild-type HSV-1 TK (69 μm), with the Asn-125 mutant decreasing (50 μm), the Glu-125 mutant increasing (473 μm), and the Asp-125 mutant having minimal activity.2 For this study, the cDNAs for these three mutants and the wild-type HSV-1 TK were incorporated into a retroviral plasmid (12McMasters R. Jones K.E. Saylors R.L. Hendrix E.M. Moyer M.P. Drake R.R. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and used to stably transfect NIH3T3 fibroblasts and the human colon tumor cell line HCT-116 as described under “Materials and Methods.” From a panel of multiple HSV-1 TK-expressing clones, a subset of clones from each cell line expressing wild-type HSV-1 TK, the Asn-125 HSV-1 TK mutant (Asn-125 TK), the Glu-125 HSV-1 TK mutant (Glu-125 TK), and the Asp-125 HSV-1 TK mutant (Asp-125 TK) were selected for comparatively equivalent levels of HSV-1 TK protein expression based on Western blot determinations. Initially, these two sets of HSV-1 TK-expressing NIH3T3 and HCT-116 cell lines were evaluated for intracellular metabolism of [3H]GCV, [3H]thymidine, or [3H]dC. Cells were labeled with [3H]GCV for 18 h, and then nucleotides were extracted in ice-cold 70% methanol as described previously (12McMasters R. Jones K.E. Saylors R.L. Hendrix E.M. Moyer M.P.

The data in Table I summarize the amount of total nucleotide metabolites isolated in the methanol-soluble extracts (pmol/106 cells) as well as the total amount of methanol-insoluble metabolites representative of incorporation into DNA. The Asn-125 TK metabolizes GCV at (or near) equal levels to the wild-type HSV-1 TK in both cell lines. The methanol-insoluble data, although only a crude indicator of [3H]GCV incorporation into DNA, reflects the numbers obtained with the soluble extracts. As compared with the non-HSV-1 TK-expressing HCT-116 cells and consistent with minimal enzymatic activity,2 minimal [3H]GCV metabolism was detected in the Asp-125 TK cells, and these cells were not further evaluated.Table ITotal methanol soluble and insoluble 3 H-labeled metabolitesCell LineTotal extracted metabolitesNIH3T3HCT-116[3H]GCV[3H]GvDNA[3H]GCV[3H]GvDNA[3H]T[3H]dCpmol/10 6 cellsParent2.82.81.11.22.41.1Gln-125 TK49848121614152.04.5Asn-125 TK5854210851338.01.2Glu-125 TK3.62.633273.30.9Asp-125 TKNDND1.01.6NDND Open table in a new tab The methanol-soluble metabolites were further separated into their constituent phosphorylated GCV metabolites by thin layer chromatography (25Drake R.R.

As presented in Table II, the predominant metabolite in each HSV-1 TK-expressing cell line was GCVTP. In both HCT-116 and NIH3T3 cell lines, the Asn-125 TK cells indicated slightly higher levels of GCVTP as compared with wild-type HSV-1 TK cell lines. The Glu125-TK in HCT-116 cells resulted in a 23-fold or greater decrease in GCVTP levels, whereas levels of GCVTP in the NIH3T3 cells was only weakly detected. This difference in the levels of GCVTP in the two Glu-125 TK-expressing cell lines could explain the lack of sensitivity to GCV killing observed for the NIH3T3 Glu-125 TK cell lines.Table IIPhosphorylated metabolites of [3 H]GCV and [3 H]thymidine from HCT-116 and NIH3T3 cell clonesPhosphorylated metabolitesNIH3T3HCT-116GCVMPGCVDPGCVTPGCVMPGCVDPGCVTPTMPTTPpmol/10 6 cellsParent0.2000.400.40.10.2Gln-125TK WT1222232 (48)96101415 (30)1.29.5Asn-125TK1121272 (71)95104533 (44)0.20.9Glu-125TK001.6 (0.4)3.02.518 (5)0.20.4 Open table in a new tab Because previous enzymatic data indicated that the Asn-125 and Glu-125 mutations had altered deoxypyrimidine substrate utilization, the metabolism of thymidine and dC in the HCT-116 cell set were examined. Cells were grown to confluency and labeled with either [3H]thymidine or [3H]dC for 1 or 2 h, respectively, prior to methanol extraction. If labeling was done in subconfluent, dividing cultures, we found that the metabolite numbers reflected cell growth rates and therefore cellular kinase activities rather than that of HSV-1 TK activity (data not shown). As presented in the last two columns of Table I, the levels of deoxypyrimidine metabolites extracted from the mutant HSV-1 TK cells were analogous to those isolated from parental HCT-116 cells rather than the wild-type HSV-1 TK cells. As shown in Table II, the levels of TMP and TTP separated from the methanol-soluble fractions of the [3H]thymidine-labeled HCT-116 Asn-125 TK and Glu-125 TK cells were similar to parental HCT116 cells rather than the wild-type HSV-1 TK-expressing 116 cell line. These metabolite levels reflect the enzymatic properties and altered substrate specificities of the Glu-125 and Asn-125 HSV-1 TKs. Thus when expressed in cell lines, these mutant forms of HSV-1 TK appear to function more as GCV kinases rather than thymidine kinases. During characterization of the different HSV-1 TK-expressing cell lines, it was observed using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell viability assay that HCT-116 cells expressing the poor GCV metabolizing Glu-125 TK were just as sensitive to GCV killing as the high GCV metabolizing wild-type or Asn-125 TK enzyme.2 Therefore, the HCT-116 cell panel was further evaluated for sensitivity to GCV using a more sensitive clonal dilution assay. Because the Glu-125 TK expressed in NIH3T3 cells had little effect on their GCV sensitivities, only the HCT-116 cell panel was evaluated in the rest of the study. Cells previously plated in 24-well plates were treated with GCV (0–10 μm) in triplicate for 24 h. Following drug removal, cells were diluted and replated in fresh medium from dilutions of 1:10 to 1:10,000. Surviving cell colonies were counted 6–7 days later. As shown in Fig. 1, 0.1 μm GCV treatment led to a 2-log decrease in the wild-type and Asn-125 TK-expressing cell colony numbers. In the same cell lines treated with 10 μm GCV, a 4-log decrease in colony numbers were determined. In contrast, the Glu-125 TK-expressing cells treated with 0.1 GCV μm caused no reduction in cell colony numbers, whereas 1 or 10 μm GCV led to 0.7-log and 2.5-log decreases in colony numbers, respectively. At higher concentrations of GCV (20–110 μm), the the expressed Glu-125 TK led to over 3-log reductions in colony numbers (data not shown) It has been previously established that HCT-116 cells expressing HSV-1 TK are sensitive to bystander effect cell death via a connexin-43 gap junction-mediated transfer of GCV metabolites (12McMasters R. Jones K.E. Saylors R.L. Hendrix E.M. Moyer M.P. Drake R.R. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To evaluate this effect in the HSV-1 TK 116 cell panel, clonal dilution assays were performed with different proportions of HSV-1 TK-expressing cells (5–50%) mixed with HCT-116 parental cells. Cell populations were treated with 25 μm GCV for 24 h and then diluted from 1:10 to 1:10,000. As shown in Fig. 2, only 5% wild-type or Asn-125 TK-expressing cells were required to cause a greater than 1-log decrease in cell colony numbers. In these same cell lines, a greater than 4-log reduction in cell colony numbers was detected with 25 and 50% proportions of HSV-1 TK-expressing cells. For the Glu-125 TK-expressing cells, a 1-log GCV-mediated bystander effect was observed at 10% proportions, and a near 3-log decrease was detected with the 50% proportions. Even though the bystander effect with the Glu-125 TK-expressing cells was clearly attenuated relative to the other two cell lines, the Glu-125 mutant was still able to generate significant bystander effect cell killing. GCV has also been previously reported to induce S and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in HSV-1 TK-expressing glioma and melanoma cell lines (5Rubsam L.Z. Davidson B.L. Shewach D.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3873-3882PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wei S. Chao Y. Hung Y. Lin W. Yang D. Shih Y. Ch'ang L. Whang-Peng J. Yang W.K. Exp.

Cancer Lett. 1995; 96: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of 24 h of GCV treatment on the cell cycling of parental and the three HSV-1 TK-expressing cell lines was examined by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B) and Table III, GCV treatment of HCT-116 parental, non-HSV-1 TK-expressing cells had little effect on the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle as compared with untreated cells. In the wild-type and Asn-125 TK-expressing cell lines, GCV treatment (Fig. 3, Dand F) led to an increase in the proportion of cells in the S phase and undetectable percentages in G2/M phase when compared with untreated cultures (Fig. 3, C andE). For the Glu-125 TK-expressing cells, over 60% of the GCV treated cells were in S phase, and 0% were in G2/M (Fig. 3 H). The doubling rate of growth for each HCT-116 cell line was in the 15–18-h range (data not shown), thus these results are consistent with a previous study that found that HSV-1 TK-expressing glioma cells treated with GCV underwent one replication cycle prior to an S phase arrest (5Rubsam L.Z. Davidson B.L. Shewach D.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3873-3882PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIICell cycle profiles of GCV-treated cell linesCell lineCell cycle phaseG0/G1SG2/M%HCT-116 (−GCV)43.335.021.7HCT-116 (+GCV)39.044.017.1WTGln-125TK (−GCV)65.818.415.8WTGln-125TK (+GCV)60.139.90Asn-125TK (−GCV)63.418.018.6Asn-125TK (+GCV)70.030.00Glu-125TK (−GCV)62.48.529.1Glu-125TK (+GCV)39.061.00 Open table in a new tab The differential dose responses, morphological features, and cell cycle patterns associated with the Glu-125 HSV-1 TK-expressing cells treated with GCV suggested induction of a distinct cell death response different from that observed in wild-type HSV-1 TK-expressing cells. It has been previously established that GCV treatment of wild-type HSV-1 TK-expressing cell lines results in induction of apoptosis (5Rubsam L.Z. Davidson B.L. Shewach D.S.

Cell Res. 1998; 241: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, two late stage apoptosis assays, nuclear DAPI staining and caspase-3 activation, were done for GCV treatments of the three HSV-1 TK-expressing HCT-116 cell lines. As shown in Fig. 4, DAPI-stained nuclei of wild-type and Asn-125 TK-expressing cells treated with GCV for 36 or 84 h indicated progressive increases in condensed and fragmented nuclei characteristic of apoptosis. Also, the DAPI staining of these cell lines indicates a GCV-specific nuclear swelling of preapoptotic cells and enhanced staining of nucleoli. This nuclear swelling in response to GCV has been observed within 12 h of GCV administration in wild-type HSV-1 TK HCT-116 cells (data not shown) and has also been reported for other GCV treated HSV-1 TK cell lines (16Halloran P.J.

Evidence of relatively slow motion indicative of exchange between two or more local conformations on a microsecond to millisecond time scale was also found in the free protein, including two other regions of the MMP binding site (the CD and EF loops). On formation of a tight N-TIMP-2. N-MMP-3 complex, the rapid internal motion of the AB beta-hairpin was largely abolished, a change consistent with tight binding of this region to the MMP-3 catalytic domain. The extended AB beta-hairpin is not a feature of all members of the TIMP family; therefore, the binding of this highly mobile region to a site distant from the catalytic cleft of the MMPs suggests a key role in TIMP-2 binding specificity."

At a time when rat placental lactogens (rPLs) are required to support progesterone production by the corpus luteum and when relaxin expression is initiated, expression of a specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoform, PKC δ, is dramatically increased. We therefore assessed whether prolactin (PRL) receptor activation promotes activation of PKC δ in a luteinized granulosa cell model. We also assessed the activation status of PKC δ in corpora lutea obtained when the corpus luteum is exposed to chronically high concentrations of rPLs. The activity of PKC δ was assessed by two means: an immune complex (IC) assay and Western blotting with a phospho-epitope-specific antibody that detects PKC δ phosphorylated on serine 662. PKC δ activation in the IC kinase assay was determined by the ability of immunoprecipitated PKC δ to phosphorylate the PKC δ-preferential substrate small heat shock protein (HSP-27). Treatment of luteinized rat granulosa cells with phorbol myristate acetate, a known activator of PKC, promoted a 7-fold increase in HSP-27 phosphorylation by PKC δ. Similarly, immunoreactivity with the phospho-epitope-specific PKC δ antibody was increased in extracts prepared from luteinized granulosa cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate or followingin vitro activation of recombinant PKC δ. Using these assays, we assessed whether PRL receptor agonists were capable of activating PKC δ in luteinized granulosa cells. PRL receptor agonists induced translocation PKC δ from the cytosolic to the Triton-soluble membrane fraction and increased PKC δ activity assessed by both IC kinase assay and Western blotting with phospho-epitope-specific PKC δ antibody. Analysis of PKC δ activity in corpora lutea obtained during pregnancy by both the IC kinase assay and Western blotting with the phospho-epitope-specific PKC δ antibody revealed that PKC δ activity was increased throughout the second half of pregnancy. These results demonstrate that PRL receptor activation promotes the acute activation of PKC δ in luteinized rat granulosa cells. At a time when the rat is exposed to chronically high concentrations of rPLs, PKC δ is increasingly expressed and active. Maintenance of pregnancy in the rat requires the corpus luteum.

Khan I. Warshaw M.L. McLean M.P. Puryear T.K. Nelson S. Durkee T.J. Azhar S. Steinschneider A. Rao M.C. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1988; 44: 377-424PubMed Google Scholar). In the rat, the corpus luteum is the sole source of the progesterone that is necessary to maintain pregnancy to term and is thus necessary throughout pregnancy (1Gibori G. Khan I. Warshaw M.L. McLean M.P. Puryear T.K. Nelson S. Durkee T.J. Azhar S. Steinschneider A. Rao M.C. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1988; 44: 377-424PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore of great interest to assess the signal transduction pathways employed within the corpus luteum that are involved in the regulation of its function. PKC1 is a family of serine/threonine kinases that has been implicated in the regulation of numerous signaling pathways (2Mochly-Roesn D. Kauvar L.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 91-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Buckley A.R. Crowe P.D. Russell D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8649-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The PKC family consists of 10 different isoforms that have been grouped into three categories based on the structural and functional differences among family members (4Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Conventional isoforms α, βI, βII, and γ isoforms are activated by PS, DAG, and Ca2+. Novel isoforms do not require Ca2+ for kinase activity and are represented by the δ, ε, η, and θ isoforms. The atypical isoforms ζ and ι require only PS for activation. As the number of PKC isoforms has increased, so has the expectation that distinct PKC isoforms will have distinct functions within a cell. This has been, to some extent, borne out by the specific roles of PKC isoforms in mitogenesis (5Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Acs P.

The ability of a distinct PKC isoform to regulate discrete biological functions is likely due to three factors: (a) the requirements for activation of a PKC isoform as determined by that isoform's structure (4Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar); (b) the localization of different PKC isoforms to distinct subcellular locales, thus limiting access of a particular PKC isoform to relevant substrates (2Mochly-Roesn D.

The ovary of the rat has been found to express the same subset of PKC isoforms throughout all the stages of development that have been analyzed (18Cutler R.E. Maizels E.T. Brooks E.J. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These are the conventional isoforms α, βI, and βII, the novel isoforms δ and ε, and the atypical isoform ζ. The δ isoform can be distinguished from the other isoforms by the striking increase of both PKC δ mRNA and protein levels in corpora lutea in the second half of pregnancy (19Cutler R.E. Maizels E.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The rat corpus luteum is maintained in the second half of pregnancy by the combined actions of intraluteal E2 and PRL-like hormones such as the placenta-derived rPL-1 (1Gibori G. Khan I. Warshaw M.L.

We have found that rPL-1 treatment of luteinized granulosa cells induces phosphorylation of Stat 3 on both tyrosine 705 and serine 727 and induction of relaxin mRNA expression, 2C. A. Peters, E. T.

Downing S.J. Guico-Lamm M.L. O'Day-Bowman M.B. Fields P.A. Oxf. Rev. Reprod. Biol. 1993; 15: 143-189PubMed Google Scholar). Both Stat 3 serine phosphorylation and induction of relaxin expression by rPL-1 were abrogated by the PKC δ inhibitor rottlerin.2 Based on the ability of the PKC δ inhibitor rottlerin to block rPL-1-induced Stat 3 serine phosphorylation and relaxin mRNA expression, we now seek direct evidence (a) that PRL receptor activation by rPL-1 activates PKC δ in a luteinized granulosa cell model and (b) that PKC δ is active in anin vivo setting in the corpus luteum of pregnancy, coincident with high rPLs in serum of rats. Our results show that signaling through the PRL receptor promotes acute activation of PKC δ in rat luteinized granulosa cells and that the PKC δ in corpora lutea obtained when rPLs are elevated is active. These results thus implicate the PRL signaling pathway in the activation of PKC δ in corpora lutea of pregnancy.

Rats were obtained at 21 days of age from Charles River Laboratories (Portage, MI) and were maintained in accordance with “Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals” by protocols approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee. Follicles were collected from 30-day-old rats that had been administered a low dose of human chorionic gonadotrophin (0.15 IU) given subcutaneously twice daily for 2 days. On the following day, a high dose of human chorionic gonadotrophin (10 IU) was given to rats via tail vein injection, and ovaries were isolated 7 h later (22Richards J.S. Hedin L. Caston L.

(24Bley M.A. Simon J.C. Saragueta P.E. Baranao J.L. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as described by Carr et al. (25Carr D.W. DeManno D.A. Atwood A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Scott J.D. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 20729-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The medium used for all procedures was DMEM/F-12 without phenol red and with 15 mmHEPES, 3.15 g/liter glucose, 1% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, 100 IU penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Following sequential incubations at 37 °C in 6 mm EGTA in DMEM/F-12 and 0.5m sucrose in DMEM/F-12, ovaries were returned to DMEM/F-12. Granulosa cells were released into the medium from all follicles using 30-gauge needles and gentle pressure. Cells were pelleted at 100 × g for 15 min, counted using trypan blue, and plated at a density of approximately 1 × 106 cells/ml on plastic dishes. Cells were cultured in humidified atmosphere at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with 10 nm estradiol-17β (in ethanol, final concentration 0.5%). The medium was changed every 3 days. Pregnant rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. On the appropriate day of pregnancy rats were sacrificed, ovaries were dissected, corpora lutea were removed, and protein was collected from the corpora lutea as specified within. Subcellular fractions of cell or tissue extracts were prepared by homogenization in protease/phosphatase inhibitor-enriched homogenization buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by centrifugation at 105,000 × gfor 70 min. The soluble fraction was removed and the pellet resuspended in the same buffer adjusted to 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with stirring for 60 min followed by centrifugation at 105,000 ×g for 30 min. Alternatively, clarified cell lysates were prepared by homogenization in a lysis buffer (10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholic acid) followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Samples were denatured by adding 3× stop (3% SDS, 150 mm Tris-HCl, 2.4 mm EDTA, 3% β-mercaptoethanol, 30% glycerol, and 0.5% bromphenol blue) followed by heating for 5 min at 100 °C. Protein concentrations in both fractions were determined (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to membranes for Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Where appropriate, membranes were stripped of antibodies according to the protocol provided with the ECL detection system. Densitometric quantitation was performed by image analysis using a Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst or BioImage Intelligent Quantifier software. Cells were cultured for 9 days with E2 and subsequently treated with 10 nm PMA or ethanol vehicle for 10 min or with 5 μg/ml rPL-1 for 5 min. Clarified cell lysates or subcellular fractions of cell extracts were prepared, and PKC δ or control immunoprecipitations were performed on samples containing 500 μg of total protein. Antibody-antigen complexes were precipitated by further incubation with an anti-mouse Ig antibody, where applicable, and protein A-conjugated Sepharose or with protein A/G-conjugated agarose alone. Pelleted proteins were washed with low salt (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and high salt (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet-P40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA). Precipitated proteins were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay in a final volume of 110 μl (containing 45 μmα-glycerophosphate (pH 7.0), 9 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μg of exogenous substrate). Where indicated, the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm. Incubations were typically for 5 or 10 min (unless otherwise indicated) at 37 °C, and reactions were terminated by adding 50 μl of 3× stop and heat denaturation. Proteins in the samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the top half of the gel, containing PKC δ, was transferred to a membrane and subjected to Western blotting while the bottom half of the gel, containing exogenous substrate, was dried and exposed to film to detect incorporation of labeled phosphate. Alternatively, the entire gel was transferred, and phosphorylation was detected by exposure to film followed by Western blotting. A similar procedure was employed to analyze PKC δ activation during pregnancy. Pregnant rats were sacrificed on the indicated day of pregnancy, and ovaries were isolated. Corpora lutea were isolated and homogenized as described above for use in the IC kinase assay. Where indicated, kinase assay included lipids (PS (45 μg/ml) and 1,2-diolein (1.6 μg/ml)). Reactions were conducted as described above with 3.5 nm recombinant PKC δ replacing immunoprecipitated PKC δ. To begin to assess the activation of PKC isoforms during pregnancy, we employed the fact that translocation to a membrane fraction is widely recognized as an index of activation of PKC for many isoforms (2Mochly-Roesn D. Kauvar L.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 91-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions of corpora lutea from days 11, 18, and 21 of pregnancy were prepared and the cytosol and T.S. (membrane) fractions analyzed by Western blot analysis. Results depicted in Fig. 1 show that all PKC isoforms expressed are partially active at some time during the second half of pregnancy based on their presence in the T.S. fraction. PKCs α and ε are both detected in the T.S. fraction on days 11 and 21 of pregnancy and to a reduced extent on day 18 of pregnancy. In contrast, PKC βII is detected in the T.S. fraction predominately on day 18. PKC ζ is detected in the T.S. fraction only on day 21 of pregnancy. PKC δ exhibits the previously described increase in expression (19Cutler R.E. Maizels E.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and increased amounts of PKC δ are detected in the T.S. fraction as pregnancy progresses to term. Because luteal PKC δ exhibits an increase in expression during pregnancy (19Cutler R.E. Maizels E.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and appears to be partly activated throughout the second half of pregnancy, we sought to analyze PKC δ activity more closely. To this end we employed an assay that involves the immunoprecipitation of PKC δ. The kinase activity of the precipitated PKC δ is then assessed by its ability to phosphorylatein vitro HSP-27, a PKC δ preferential substrate (17Maizels E.T. Peters C.A. Kline M. Cutler R.E. Shanmugam M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This assay is conducted in the absence of exogenous activators so that the kinase activity that is measured reflects that which was attained in the cell or tissue. Fig. 2 A shows the results of an IC kinase assay performed on samples from luteinized granulosa cells. Cells were treated with either vehicle or 10 nm PMA for 10 min. The results of PKC δ immune precipitations from cytosol and T.S. fractions reveal that PMA promotes both the translocation of PKC δ from the cytosol to the T.S. fraction and the partial down-regulation of PKC δ (Fig. 2 A, top panel; compare amount of PKC δ in lane 1 with that in lanes 3and 4). PMA also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PKC δ translocated into the T.S. fraction (Fig. 2 A, second panel). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ has been observed by several groups to be a consequence of PKC δ activation, especially in response to PMA, but the function of PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation is not yet fully understood (5Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation of PKC δ on serine/threonine residues during the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2 A, third panel) mirrors the amount of PKC δ immunoprecipitated in each lane. Phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate HSP-27 by immunoprecipitated PKC δ from vehicle and PMA-treated cells is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2 A. Although PKC δ exhibits activity in the cytosolic fraction of control cells (lane 1), phosphorylation of HSP-27 by PKC δ is clearly enhanced in the T.S. fraction of PMA-treated cells consistent with PKC δ translocation to this fraction (lane 4). PMA-stimulated activation of PKC δ is most clearly appreciated when the amount of phosphorylated HSP-27 is assessed relative to the amount of PKC δ that is immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2 B). Results of this analysis show that PMA-dependent PKC δ activation is readily detected by this IC kinase assay. We further evaluated the characteristics of the in vitro PKC δ IC kinase assay. Cells were treated with 10 nm PMA for 10 min and then homogenized in a membrane extracting buffer. PKC δ was immunoprecipitated, and the IC kinase assay reaction was performed for 1–10 min. The upper panel of Fig. 3 A is a PKC δ Western blot that shows that equivalent amounts of PKC δ were immunoprecipitated. The lower panel shows that HSP-27 phosphorylation increases with time of incubation. When PKC δ antibody is omitted, PKC δ is not immunoprecipitated and HSP-27 is not phosphorylated (Fig. 3 B). HSP-27 phosphorylation by immunoprecipitated PKC δ is nearly undetectable when the in vitro reaction is performed in the presence of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (27Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudett V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 294: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these results show that the PKC δ IC kinase assay detects authentic activation of PKC δ attained in PMA-treated luteinized granulosa cells. Based on our evidence that the IC kinase assay readily detects active PKC δ and utilizing this assay, we sought to analyze the activity of PKC δ in corpora lutea obtained during the second half of pregnancy. PKC δ was immunoprecipitated from corpora lutea collected from days 11, 18, and 21 of pregnancy and homogenized in a membrane extracting buffer. The amount of PKC δ immunoprecipitated from these days of pregnancy (Fig. 4 A, top panel) correlates with the increase in PKC δ expression previously observed (19Cutler R.E. Maizels E.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ is also observed, particularly on day 21 of pregnancy. Consistent with the translocation analysis shown in Fig. 1, HSP-27 phosphorylation in the IC kinase assay is detected in each of the luteal samples and increases as pregnancy progresses (Fig. 4 A, bottom panel). These results suggest that PKC δ is indeed active throughout the second half of pregnancy, as predicted from the results presented in Fig. 1. PKC δ exhibits similar activity in corpora lutea obtained on days 18 and 21. To determine whether this level of PKC δ activity reflects maximal activation of PKC δ, we assessed the activity of PKC δ in an IC kinase assay upon addition of the PKC activators PS and DAG. Results show that PKC δ immunoprecipitated from corpora lutea on day 18 of pregnancy can be further activated in vitro when PS and DAG are added to thein vitro reaction (Fig. 4 B). Autophosphorylation of PKC δ on serine 643 is reported to be important for the regulation of PKC δ activity (29Li W. Zhang J. Bottaro D.P. Li W. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24550-24555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, mutation of this serine to an alanine did not abolish PKC δ autophosphorylation or activity (29Li W. Zhang J. Bottaro D.P. Li W. Pierce J.H. J. Biol.

Serine 662 of PKC δ has also been hypothesized as a site of autophosphorylation because of corresponding autophosphorylation sites on PKC α (serine 657) and PKC βII (serine 660). Using an epitope-specific antibody that reacts with PKC δ phosphorylated on serine 662, we sought to assess whether serine 662 autophosphorylation occurs coincident with activation of PKC δ. The time-dependent activation in vitro of recombinant PKC δ by PS and DAG is shown (Fig. 5 A). PKC δ exhibits increased histone phosphorylation and autophosphorlyation with time of incubation, as shown in the lower two panels of Fig. 5 A, and a corresponding increase in immunoreactivity as detected with the PKC δ serine 662 phospho-epitope-specific antibody (Fig. 5 A, top panel). A PKC δ Western blot confirms that equivalent amounts of PKC δ are present in each lane (Fig. 5 A, top panel). We also evaluated the ability of the PKC δ serine 662 phospho-epitope-specific antibody to detect PMA-dependent PKC δ activation in luteinized granulosa cells. Luteinized granulosa cells were stimulated with 10 nm PMA or vehicle for 10 min. Results show that the phosphorylation of PKC δ on serine 662 is also increased following PMA-dependent activation of PKC δ in luteinized granulosa cells (Fig. 5 B). PKC δ exhibits some basal activity, based on phospho-epitope-specific antibody immunoreactivity in the absence of PMA treatment, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2. To further confirm the activation of PKC δ in rat corpora lutea during pregnancy, Western blotting with the serine 662 phospho-epitope-specific antibody was performed on extracts prepared from corpora lutea obtained on day 11, 18, or 21 of pregnancy. The increase in PKC δ expression is again apparent (Fig. 6 , lower panel). Immunoreactivity with the serine 662 phospho-epitope-specific antibody is equivalent on day 18 and 21 of pregnancy, and both are clearly increased compared with the reactivity seen on day 11 of pregnancy (Fig. 6 , upper panel). Thus, the relative activity of PKC δ detected in the corpora lutea of pregnancy by both membrane translocation (Fig. 1) and IC kinase assay (Fig. 4) is mirrored by reactivity with the serine 662 phospho-epitope-specific antibody. During the second half of pregnancy, when we detect activated PKC δ, the rat corpus luteum is maintained exclusively by the combined actions of intraluteal E2, aromatized from androgens provided by the placenta (1Gibori G.

https://openalex.org/W2034610478,"Several constitutively active mutant forms of the common beta subunit of the human IL-3, IL-5 and GM-CSF receptors (hbetac), which enable it to signal in the absence of ligand, have recently been described. Two of these, V449E and I374N, are amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane and extracellular regions of hbetac, respectively. A third, FIDelta, contains a 37 amino acid duplication in the extracellular domain. We have shown previously that when expressed in primary murine haemopoietic cells, the extracellular mutants confer factor-independence on cells of the neutrophil and monocyte lineages only, whereas V449E does so on all cell types of the myeloid and erythroid compartments. To study the in vivo effects and leukaemic potential of these mutants, we have expressed all three in mice by bone marrow reconstitution using retrovirally infected donor cells. Expression of the extracellular mutants leads to an early onset, chronic myeloproliferative disorder marked by elevations in the neutrophil, monocyte, erythrocyte and platelet lineages. In contrast, expression of V449E leads to an acute leukaemia-like syndrome of anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and blast cell expansion. These data support the possibility that activating mutations in hbetac are involved in haemopoietic disorders in man."

In the present study, model peptides containing the consensus repeating units PEQQEGQLEL and LEQQEGQLEH, found in the central region of human involucrin, were studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy, molecular modeling, and energy minimization. These peptides have intrinsic α-helix-forming properties as indicated by their circular dichroic spectra obtained in the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. Peptide (LEQQEGQLEH)3 had an α-helix content of 100% in 100% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol at 0 °C. The energy-minimized α-helix showed that only 50% of the glutamate side chains may be available for the attachment of lipids. However, when a 310-helix was assumed for the GQL or GQLE residues in LEQQEGQLEH, all of the glutamate side chains were arrayed on one face of the helix, and all of the glutamine side chains were arrayed on the opposite face. A similar result was obtained when the nonhelical part of PEQQEGQLEL was assumed to contain a β-turn III, which is equivalent to a short portion of 310-helix. The results of this study suggest that when the central segment of human involucrin is predominantly α-helical, accompanied by short 310-helical segments, the protein can function as a scaffold for the attachment of both lipids and proteins.

These proteins are cross-linked together byN ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isodipeptide bonds formed by the action of transglutaminases and also by disulfide bonds. Studies of the structure and assembly of the protein envelope indicate that involucrin is one of the proteins that is deposited first and that it forms a scaffold for the subsequent deposition of the other proteins (3Eckert R.L.

Covalently attached to the exterior of the corneocyte protein envelope is a lipid envelope composed mainly of ω-hydroxyceramides (19Wertz P.W. Downing D.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Swartzendruber D.C. Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 88: 709-713Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Chemical evidence indicates that these lipid molecules are attached to proteins through ester bonds, since they are easily released by treatment with mild alkali (19Wertz P.W. Downing D.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Swartzendruber D.C. Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 88: 709-713Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The availability of sufficient ester bonds requires a protein that is rich in free carboxyl side chains (21Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 109-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, involucrin, which has a high glutamate content (≈20% of the amino acids), has been proposed to act as a scaffold for the attachment of the lipid layer to the protein envelope (22Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This idea was confirmed by biochemical and mass spectrometric characterization of lipopeptide fragments obtained from human corneocyte envelopes by proteolysis, which indicated that approximately 35% of the peptides were derived from involucrin (23Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17763-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, from studies of protein and lipid envelopes, it is generally accepted that involucrin is covalently attached to both proteins and lipids. Biophysical characterization of human involucrin using secondary structure prediction, CD1 and electron microscopy indicated that involucrin is a rod-shaped molecule that possesses 50–75% α-helical content (4Yaffe M.B. Beegen H. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12233-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the glutamine residues are circumferentially distributed along the length of the α-helix and that this arrangement maximizes intermolecular cross-linking between involucrin and other proteins (4Yaffe M.B. Beegen H. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12233-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of glutamate residues and its role in the attachment of lipids were not addressed in that study. Initially, we predicted that human involucrin might adopt a β-sheet structure, since this could provide the required surface density of glutamate residues for the attachment of lipids (22Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This prediction seemed to be supported by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance studies of corneocyte envelopes isolated from pig epidermis, which suggested that the cross-linked proteins are predominantly in the β-sheet conformation (24Lazo N.D. Meine J.G. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 296-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction studies of murine corneocyte envelopes also indicated the dominant presence of β-sheets (25White S.H. Mirejovsky D. King G.I. Biochemistry. 1992; 27: 3725-3732Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, human involucrin is a distinctly different protein than that of lower mammals (26Tseng H. Green H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1990; 7: 293-302PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, care must be taken in extrapolating results with lower mammals to humans. In the present study, we used model peptides to show that the α-helical character that has been demonstrated for the involucrin molecule as a whole (4Yaffe M.B. Beegen H. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12233-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can be adopted by the specific regions that are rich in glutamate residues. Also, using computer modeling, we investigated whether an α-helical conformation would array the glutamate residues of these regions appropriately for attachment of the lipid envelope. Our results suggest that a mixture of α-helical and 310-helical conformations in the central segment of involucrin provides sufficient surface density of glutamate side chains for the attachment of lipids. Peptides were synthesized in the Protein Structure Facility of the University of Iowa using an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer. A stepwise solid-phase procedure using rink amide MBHA resin and fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-protected amino acids was employed. The crude peptides were purified by preparative C18 reverse-phase HPLC. The purity of all peptides used in this study was confirmed to be >95% by analytical C18 reverse-phase HPLC. Peptide identity was confirmed by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry and by amino acid analysis. CD spectra were acquired using an Aviv Associates model 62DS spectrometer. Stoppered optical cells with a path length of 1 mm were used in all acquisitions. Spectra were obtained by taking readings every 0.5 nm with an averaging time of 4 s and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Ellipticity measurements were expressed as mean residue ellipticity, θ, in units of deg cm2dmol−1 and calculated from the equation, θ=θobs(MRW)/10l[C](Eq. 1) in which θ is the observed ellipticity in degrees, MRW is the mean residue weight of the peptide (molecular weight divided by the number of residues), [C] is the peptide concentration in g/liter, andl is the optical path length in centimeters. Peptide concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid amino acid analysis. The helix content of each peptide was determined from the values of their mean residue ellipticities at 222 nm (θ222). Based on CD studies of model peptides that mimic the α-helical regions of intermediate-filament proteins, the θ222 for a 100% helix was taken as −43,000 deg cm2 dmol−1 (27Lazo N.D. Downing D.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2559-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Energy minimization of possible structures for (PEQQEGQLEL)1–3 and (LEQQEGQLEH)1–3 was performed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation in the Image Analysis Facility of the University of Iowa using Sybyl 6.4 software. The conformational energies were minimized using the Kollman all-atom force field and Kollman charges using 1,000 iterations or until convergence was reached. Energies for the 10-residue repeating units were calculated by subtracting the energy of the 20-residue peptide from that of the 30-residue peptide. These are reported here in units of kcal/mol-residue. An important feature of human involucrin is the presence of a central segment of high homology whose consensus repeat sequence is (P/L)EQQEGQL(E/K)H (2Eckert R.L. Green H. Cell. 1986; 46: 583-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). From CD, molecular modeling, and electron microscopy, it has been shown that the central segment contains a large proportion of α-helices (4Yaffe M.B. Beegen H. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12233-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial molecular modeling of this segment, using a graphical method developed for the expression of local spatial relationships between amino acid residues (28Downing D.T. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), is shown in Fig. 1. A predominantly α-helical conformation for the central segment is indicated, with most of the glutamate side chains arrayed on one face of the α-helices, and most of the glutamine side chains arrayed on the opposite face. To check the validity of this model, peptides containing the consensus 10-residue repeating units LEQQEGQLEH and PEQQEGQLEL were synthesized and investigated by CD spectroscopy, revealing random coil conformation in water (Fig. 2) but α-helical structures in TFE (Fig. 3). In addition, (PEQQEGQLEL)3 and (LEQQEGQLEH)3 sequences were subjected to energy minimization by computer, confirming their predominantly α-helix-forming properties in conformations that would maximize the attachment of both lipids and proteins.FIG. 2CD spectra of the 20- and 30-residue model peptides of the central segment of human involucrin in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7. solid line, (PEQQEGQLEL)3; dashed line, (PEQQEGQLEL)2; dashed-dotted line, (LEQQEGQLEH)3; and dotted line, (LEQQEGQLEH)2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 3CD spectra of model peptides of the central segment of human involucrin in the presence of TFE . a, (PEQQEGQLEL)1; b, (PEQQEGQLEL)2;c, (PEQQEGQLEL)3; d, (LEQQEGQLEH)1; e, (LEQQEGQLEH)2; andf, (LEQQEGQLEH)3.

Similar spectra were obtained after the addition of 2 molal sodium sulfate, a salt that is known to promote structure formation in peptides that contain hydrophobic residues. 2N. D. Lazo and D. T. Downing, unpublished observations. At pH 2.7, below the pK a of the glutamate side chains, the peptides remained predominantly random coil. α-Helices were formed by all of the synthetic peptides in the presence of TFE, a nonpolar solvent that has been shown to promote native-like α-helical structures in peptides with intrinsic α-helix forming properties (29Sönnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8790-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 30Cammers-Goodwin A. Allen T.J. Oslick S.L. McClure K.F. Lee J.H. Kemp D.S. J. Am.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14613-14622Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). TFE has a dialectric constant that closely approximates that of the interior of proteins and has recently been shown to promote structure formation by minimizing the exposure of the peptide backbone to water (30Cammers-Goodwin A. Allen T.J. Oslick S.L. McClure K.F. Lee J.H. Kemp D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3082-3090Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 32Kentsis A. Sosnick T.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14613-14622Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, solvents with high concentrations of TFE may mimic the hydrophobic environment of involucrin found in the corneocyte envelope. Fig. 3 presents CD spectra of (PEQQEGQLEL)1–3 and (LEQQEGQLEH)1–3. Peptide (PEQQEGQLEL)1 was insoluble in 100% TFE but was soluble in 25–75% TFE. The spectra of (LEQQEGQLEH)2and (LEQQEGQLEH)3 in 75–100% TFE were characteristic of the dominant presence of an α-helix (33Holzwarth G. Doty P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, e andf); each showed a minimum at 222 nm (n-π* transition), a second minimum at 208 nm (π-π* transition polarized along the helix axis), and a maximum at 193 nm (π-π* transition polarized perpendicular to the helix axis). On the other hand, the spectra of (LEQQEGQLEH)1 (Fig. 3 d) and (PEQQEGQLEL)1–3 (Fig. 3, a–c) had minima at approximately 220 nm and at 202–203 nm, indicating a lower proportion of α-helix. Table I shows the θ222 and corresponding α-helix contents of the peptides in 100% TFE at 0 °C. Peptides (PEQQEGQLEL)2 and (PEQQEGQLEL)3 had similar helix contents, which suggests that α-helix formation in these peptides is independent of chain length. In 25–75% TFE, the series of (PEQQEGQLEL)1–3peptides exhibited similar spectra, indicating similar helix contents (Fig. 3, a–c), perhaps because the α-helix formed by the PEQQEGQLEL repeating unit is interrupted by the proline of the next repeating unit. Proline lacks a peptide NH group that can participate in backbone hydrogen bonding, and because of its cyclic ring structure, it is energetically unfavorable for the preceding residue to form an α-helix (34Piela L. Némethy G. Scheraga H.A. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the helix content of peptides containing the LEQQEGQLEH repeating unit was dependent on the length of the chain (Fig. 3, d–f, Table I); peptide (LEQQEGQLEH)3 had the highest helicity, with a θ222 of −41,900 deg cm2 dmol−1, corresponding to an α-helix content of almost 100%.Table Iα-Helix contents of involucrin model peptides in 100% TFE at 0 °CPeptide−θ222% α-helix10 3 deg cm 2 dmol −1(PEQQEGQLEL)225.258.6(PEQQEGQLEL)324.857.7(LEQQEGQLEH)125.358.8(LEQQEGQLEH)236.584.9(LEQQEGQLEH)341.997.4 Open table in a new tab An isodichroic point at 201.5 nm was observed for the (LEQQEGQLEH)1–3 peptides (Fig. 3, d–f), which suggests that, under all conditions of TFE concentration and temperature used, each amino acid residue in the peptides existed as either random coil or α-helix (35Scholtz J.M. Qian H. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no isodichroic point was observed in the spectra of the (PEQQEGQLEL)2 and (PEQQEGQLEL)3 (Fig. 3, b–c), indicating the presence of more than two conformations. All residues of (LEQQEGQLEH)3 were assigned backbone torsion angles corresponding to an α-helix (φ = −57°, ψ = −47°), and then the minimum conformational energy of the peptide was computed. Fig. 4 a shows the α-helix after energy minimization. The conformational energy of the LEQQEGQLEH repeating unit was −16.3 kcal/mol-residue, which is lower than the energy of a corresponding β-strand (−14.0 kcal/mol-residue). However, in the pure α-helix, as shown in Fig. 4 a, only 50% of the glutamate side chains may be available for the attachment of lipid. Therefore, possible modifications of the α-helical conformation of (LEQQEGQLEH)3 that would maximize its potential for the attachment of both lipids and proteins were investigated. These modifications began with the glycine residue, which, primarily because of the conformational flexibility of its backbone (36Blaber M. Zhang X.-J. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 260: 1637-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), is a known α-helix breaker. It is also known that facile transitions between α-helix and 310-helix occur in proteins and that these transitions play an important role in protein recognition and function (37Millhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3873-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 38Gerstein M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 39McPhalen C.A.

Most 310-helices in proteins are short (3–4 residues long) compared with α-helices, which have a mean length of 10 residues (40Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 601-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 b shows the energy-minimized structure of (LEQQEGQLEH)3 in which the segment GQL was modeled as a 310-helix, i.e.the backbone torsion angles of GQL were initially set to φ = −50° and ψ = −28°. In the resulting conformation, all of the glutamate side chains were arrayed on one face of the helix, and all of the glutamine side chains were arrayed on the opposite face. The computed conformational energy of the structure in Fig. 4 bwas −15.3 kcal/mol-residue. Structures similar to Fig. 4 bwere obtained when four-residue segments of (LEQQEGQLEH)3(including GQLE, EHLE, HLEQ, LEHL, QQEG, QEGQ, and EGQL) were modeled as 310-helices. The structure in which the segment GQLE was modeled as 310-helix (Fig. 4 c) had the lowest conformational energy (−15.6 kcal/mol-residue). The conformational energies of the structures containing 310-helices were slightly higher (by ≤1 kcal/mol-residue) than the 100% α-helix. In modeling (PEQQEGQLEL)3, it was initially assumed that the non-α-helical part included proline and the preceding residue (34Piela L. Némethy G. Scheraga H.A. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To account for the 40% non-α-helical content, two other residues next to LP were included as part of the non-α-helical segment, i.e. LPEQ, ELPE, and LELP were modeled as random coil. The resulting structures were energy-minimized, and their energies were compared. The lowest energy (−15 kcal/mol-residue) was obtained from the structure in which the LPEQ segment was assumed to be random coil. The energy-minimized structure of (PEQQEGQLEL)3, composed of three α-helices separated from each other by the LPEQ random coil segments, was not linear. When the LPEQ segment was modeled as a type III β-turn, a structure showing all of the glutamate side chains on one face of the helix and all of the glutamine side chains on the opposite face, similar to Fig. 4,b and c, was obtained. The conformational energy of the structure was −15.9 kcal/mol-residue, which was lower than the energy of the structure in which LPEQ was modeled as random coil. From independent studies of the lipid and the protein envelopes, it has been suggested that involucrin acts as a scaffold for the attachment of both proteins and lipids (3Eckert R.L. Yaffe M.B.

For the protein to perform this function, it must present a surface that is rich in carboxylic acid groups opposite a surface that is rich in glutamines. In the present study we have shown that specific sequences constituting the central region of involucrin can adopt thermodynamically feasible α-helical plus 310-helical conformations that fulfill the putative function of the protein, presenting all of the glutamate residues in a surface density adequate for attachment of the corneocyte lipid envelope. The model peptides that we have investigated in this study represent two parts of the central segment of human involucrin. Residues 176–225 of the protein are made up of five repeats of PEQQEGQLEL. Our studies of the peptides containing PEQQEGQLEL indicate that this segment of the protein may contain five α-helical regions separated from each other by four LPEQ segments. Energy calculations indicate that the LPEQ segments may form a β-turn III, equivalent to a segment of a 310-helix (43Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., NY1993Google Scholar), resulting in a linear structure in which all of the glutamate side chains are sequestered on one face, and all of the glutamine side chains are on the opposite face. The model peptides that contain the consensus repeat sequence LEQQEGQLEH possess intrinsic α-helix-forming properties that are dependent on chain length. This suggests that the sections that join the repeating units form part of the α-helix. Previous molecular modeling of α-helices from the repeating unit LEQQEGQLKH by Yaffe and co-workers (4Yaffe M.B. Beegen H. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12233-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that when an extra amino acid is inserted between the consensus repeating units, a clustering of the glutamine residues on one face of the helix results. Here, we have shown that when an α-helix and a 310-helix are present in the 10-residue repeating units, helical structures are obtained in which all of the glutamate side chains are sequestered on one face of the helix, and all of the glutamine side chains are clustered on the opposite face. The CD spectrum of human involucrin in phosphate buffer at neutral pH indicated a θ222 of −18,000 deg cm2 dmol−1 (4Yaffe M.B. Beegen H. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12233-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since a 310-helix possesses an α-helix-like CD spectrum (41Sudha T.S. Vijayakumar E.K.S. Balaram P. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983; 22: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and 310-helices have been proposed as intermediates along the α-helix unfolding pathway (37Millhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3873-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 42Soman K.V. Karimi A. Case D.A. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1351-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that a value between −15,000 and −30,000 deg cm2 dmol−1for the θ222 of helical peptides or proteins suggests the presence of a mixture of nascent helix, 310-helix, and α-helix (37Millhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3873-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our energy calculations on the helical structures that contain the repeating unit LEQQEGQLEH indicate a slightly higher energy for the structures that contain 310-helices than for the pure α-helix. The 310-helix is more tightly wound and is less stable than the α-helix due to several close contacts and less optimal hydrogen bond geometry (44Toniolo C. Benedetti E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 350-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). However, there is no disallowed region between the α-helical and the 310-helical conformations in the Ramachandran plot, and therefore α-helix to 310-helix transformations can easily occur (44Toniolo C. Benedetti E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 350-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Furthermore, calculations indicate that the low dielectric of proteins and the presence of lipid membranes could provide conditions that may stabilize the 310-helix (45Smythe M. Huston S.E. Marshall G.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11594-11595Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the corneocyte envelopes, the orienting effect of the bound lipids on one side of involucrin and the cross-linked proteins on the other side could also stabilize the 310-helices. It also may be significant that esterification of the envelope lipids to the involucrin glutamates would remove the carboxylate electrostatic charges that might oppose α-helix formation. Furthermore, lateral hydrophobic interactions would tightly pack the attached envelope lipids, stabilizing and condensing the involucrin conformation. There are two important reasons for having most if not all of the glutamate side chains sequestered on one face of involucrin in the human epidermal corneocyte envelope. First, it provides the high density of glutamate side chains required for attachment of the lipids in the interface between the protein and lipid compound envelopes of the corneocyte (19Wertz P.W. Downing D.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Swartzendruber D.C. Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17763-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For this, every molecule in a tightly packed monolayer of hydroxyceramides is required to be attached through ester bonds to an underlying planar surface of protein (20Swartzendruber D.C. Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 88: 709-713Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 21Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Invest.

Second, isolating the glutamate side chains on one face of involucrin may increase the activity of transglutaminase for the formation of isodipeptide cross links, since it has been shown that in addition to being exposed on the surface of the protein, there should be no charged residues on either side of the target glutamine (46Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that involucrin existing predominantly as α-helices and 310-helices can function as a scaffold not only for the attachment of proteins but also for the attachment of lipids."

In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which high levels of ST3 expression can be induced. In contrast to the early and transient induction of interstitial collagenase by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the fibroblastic induction of ST3 was found to be delayed and to require protein neosynthesis. We demonstrated that this induction is transcriptional and does not result from changes in RNA stability. By looking next to promoter regions accessible to DNase I upon gene induction, we have identified two distal elements and have characterized their role in the transcriptional regulation of ST3. The first one is a TPA-responsive element that controls the base-line ST3 promoter activity but is not required for its activation. We demonstrate that ST3 gene induction is actually mediated by the second element, a C/EBP-binding site, by showing: (i) that this element becomes accessible in cells induced to express ST3, (ii) that endogenous C/EBPβ binds to the ST3 promoter, and (iii) that this binding leads to ST3 transcriptional activation. Our study provides new insights into the regulation of ST3 and suggests an additional role for C/EBP transcription factors in tissue remodeling processes associated with this MMP.

Remodeling of the extracellular matrix occurs during the growth and differentiation of normal tissues as well as in pathological conditions involving abnormal growth and tissue destruction. Various members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1family have been shown to play an active role in these processes by degrading most of the extracellular matrix components (1Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Stromelysin-3 (ST3) is a member of this MMP family, and its expression in vivo has been associated with physiological situations such as development (2Lefebvre O. Regnier C. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Chambon P. Basset P. Rio M.C. Development. 1995; 121: 947-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mammary gland involution (3Lefebvre O. Wolf C. Limacher J.M. Hutin P. Wendling C. Le Meur M. Basset P.

Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Bellocq J.P. Basset P. Invasion Metastasis. 1994; 14: 269-275PubMed Google Scholar, 7Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Lefebvre O. Noël A. Chenard M.P. Wolf C. Anglard P.

Rubens R. Anglard P. Hart I. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the contribution of ST3 to tumor progression has been reported in experimental models of tumorigenesis (11Noël A.C. Lefebvre O. Maquoi E. Van Hoorde L. Chenard M.P. Mareel M.

Therefore, this MMP might represent a potential target for therapeutic approaches directed against the stromal compartment of human carcinomas. At the cellular level, ST3 has been essentially observed in cells of mesodermal origin such as fibroblastic cells both in vivoand in culture where it can be induced by growth factors (13Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 14Delany A.M. Canalis E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent studies using “tumor/stroma” coculture assays have shown that the fibroblastic expression of ST3 can be induced when fibroblasts are exposed to epithelial cancer cells (16Mari B.P. Anderson I.C. Mari S.E. Ning Y.Y. Lutz Y. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 618-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Ahmad A. Marshall J.F. Basset P. Anglard P. Hart I.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), as initially suggested by in situ hybridization studies of breast carcinomas indicating a predominant expression of ST3 in fibroblastic cells located in close vicinity to epithelial cancer cells (13Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). However, although a number of in vivo studies have emphasized the possible contribution of this enzyme in physiological and pathological processes, the molecular factors and mechanisms controlling its expression are still poorly understood. Most MMP genes are characterized by the presence of an AP-1-binding site in their proximal promoter that mediates transcriptional activation by growth factors, phorbol esters, and oncogenes (18Borden P. Heller R.A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1997; 7: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In addition, this AP-1-binding site also mediates their transcriptional repression by retinoic acid and glucocorticoids (19Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 20Schroen D.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar), which have been associated with antitumoral (21Lotan R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and anti-inflammatory (22Vayssiere B.M. Dupont S. Choquart A. Petit F. Garcia T. Marchandeau C. Gronemeyer H. Resche-Rigon M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) activity, respectively. In contrast, despite the fact that ST3 can also be induced by phorbol esters, its proximal promoter is characterized by the absence of an AP-1 consensus-binding site and the presence of a retinoic acid-responsive element (23Anglard P. Melot T. Guérin E. Thomas G. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Accordingly, ST3 expression is induced by retinoic acid through this retinoic acid-responsive element interacting with retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor heterodimers (15Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, basic fibroblast growth factor was shown more recently to modulate ST3 expression in osteoblastic cells by controlling the stability of its mRNA as well as its transcriptional rate (14Delany A.M. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16595-16600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, no regulatory element that could account for basic fibroblast growth factor- or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-mediated ST3 induction has been identified, and to our knowledge, the proximal retinoic acid-responsive element remains the only regulatory element that has so far been functionally characterized in the ST3 promoter. In the present study, we have further investigated the mechanism by which high levels of ST3 gene expression can be induced. The tumor promoter TPA was used to compare the strong fibroblastic induction of ST3 to that of interstitial collagenase to determine the respective contribution of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. By looking to DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHS) associated with open chromatin in TPA-differentiated cells, we have identified a distal AP-1-binding site and a C/EBP element and determined their respective roles in the ST3 promoter activation. Our data demonstrate that ST3 induction by TPA is associated with a strong increase in C/EBP DNA binding activity and that the isolated C/EBP element and the native ST3 promoter are similarly activated by C/EBPβ in a dose response manner. HFL1 embryonic human fibroblasts (CCL 153) and the rhabdomyosarcoma tumor cell line RD (CCL 136) were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum, unless indicated for specific experiments. HeLa cells were cultured in the same medium in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum. TPA was purchased from Sigma, whereas 9-cis-retinoic acid was provided by P. F. Sorter, J. F. Grippo, and A. A. Levin (Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ). The requirement of newly synthesized protein was addressed by using 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, a concentration that has been previously shown to efficiently inhibit translation in human fibroblasts without apparent toxicity for a period of 24 h (24Overall C.M. Wrana J.L. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14064-14071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and RNA extraction was carried out by the guanidinium thiocyanate phenol/chloroform procedure (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). 10–30 μg of total RNA was denatured at 65 °C for 5 min and electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel prior to be transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization conditions and cDNA probes were previously described (15Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). mRNA stability was evaluated by the RNA synthesis inhibitor-chase method (26Nanbu R. Menoud P.A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4920-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB, Sigma) was used to inhibit transcription (27Yankulov K. Yamashita K. Roy R. Egly J.M. Bentley D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23922-23925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in fibroblasts, and total RNA was isolated at several time points. The amount of ST3 mRNA and the time course for its decay following DRB addition was measured by Northern blot hybridization. ST3 mRNA half-life was determined after signal quantification using a bio-imaging analyzer (BAS 2000; Fuji Ltd.). Nuclei isolation and in vitro elongation reaction were essentially performed as described previously (15Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were prepared from control cells or cells treated with TPA in serum-free medium using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Nascent RNA transcripts from 2 × 107 nuclei were allowed to elongate in the presence of [α-32P]UTP and were subsequently purified using phenol/chloroform extraction followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Labeled RNA transcripts were hybridized for 3 days to denatured and immobilized cDNAs, and signal quantification was carried out as described above. Nuclei preparation for DNase I-hypersensitive site mapping was performed essentially as described (28Bellard M. Dretzen G. Giangrande A. Ramain P. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 317-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, control and TPA (50 ng/ml)-treated cells were harvested and washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of Buffer D (5 mmPIPES, pH 7.5, 85 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 5% sucrose) containing 14 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and placed on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were then washed twice by centrifugation in Buffer D, and aliquots were taken for estimating DNA concentration. Finally, purified nuclei were analyzed under phase contrast microscope and were resuspended at a concentration of 0.5 μg DNA/μl in DNase I digestion buffer (Buffer D). Digestion with DNase I (grade I, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was performed by adding 1, 3, or 6 μl of diluted enzyme (1 U/μl) to 200 μl (100 μg) of nuclei suspension for 20 min at 20 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of stop extraction solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, 0.3% SDS, 1 mg/ml Proteinase K). After an overnight incubation at 50 °C, DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform and chloroform and precipitated by adding 13 volume of 10 m ammonium acetate and 2.5 volume of ethanol. DNase I digests were then resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 μg were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes. Southern blot was performed as described previously (23Anglard P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with a polymerase chain reaction generated probe (nucleotides −2708 to −2564) using the 5′-primer 5′-ACAGAGTCTCACTCTGTTGCC-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-TTAGCTGGGCATGGTGGCACGTG-3′. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described elsewhere (29Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Cells (107) that had been either unstimulated or stimulated with TPA for 40 h or with 9-cis-retinoic acid for 3 days were collected, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 0.8 ml of ice-cold low salt buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) including pepstatin, antipain, aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin at 2.5 mg/ml each). After 10 min on ice, the nuclei were centrifuged 10,000 rpm for 2 min, and the pellet was resuspended in high salt buffer C containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 26% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and proteinase inhibitors as in buffer A. Nuclei were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min to remove cell debris. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined, and small aliquots were frozen at −80 °C until required. Conditioned media from RD cells cultured in serum free conditions were centrifuged to eliminate cell debris before a 100-fold concentration by 80% ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2and 0.005% Brij-35. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Equivalent amounts of secreted or nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, secreted ST3 was revealed with a monoclonal antibody 5ST-4A9 (30Santavicca M. Noël A. Chenard M.P. Lutz Y. Stoll I. Segain J.P. Rouyer N. Rio M.C.

Cancer. 1995; 64: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) by using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG (Jackson). For nuclear extracts, the C/EBPβ specific antibody (C-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used together with a peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson). A polymerase chain reaction generated fragment containing 635 bp of the 5′ flanking region (spanning −2502 to −1868) was subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) and then released by EcoRI and EagI. The resulting fragment was isolated and purified to label the coding and noncoding strands by incorporating either [α-32P]dCTP or [α-32P]dATP with the Klenow enzyme. The purified probes (10,000 cpm) were mixed with 1 μg of poly d(IC), 40 μg of nuclear extract and 50 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 60 mm KCl in a final volume of 100 μl. Binding was performed for 15 min at room temperature, after which 5 μl of increasing DNase I concentrations (1, 3, and 5 milliunits/μl for naked DNA and 50, 100, and 200 milliunits/μl in the presence of protein extract) was added for 2 min. 100 μl of stop solution containing 1% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8, 40 μg/ml tRNA, 100 μg/ml proteinase K was added for 15 min at 37 °C. DNA was extracted, precipitated, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 5 μl of loading buffer. Digested DNA was then resolved by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide denaturating sequencing gel. Double-stranded oligonucleotides with 5′-overhangs were generated and labeled by incorporating [α-32P]dATP and/or [α-32P]dCTP with the Klenow enzyme. Labeled probes (20,000 cpm) were added to a 20-μl binding reaction containing 10 μl of 2× binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol), 0.8 μg of poly d(IC), and 60 mm KCl and incubated with nuclear extracts (8 μg) for 15 min at room temperature. Competition assays were performed by adding a 10, 50, or 100 molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides. In supershift experiments, the pan-C/EBP (Δ198) and C/EBP-β (C-19) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the binding reaction for an additional incubation of 30 min. The protein-DNA complexes were separated from the free probes by electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel of a low ionic strength (0.5× TBE (50 mm Tris borate, 50 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA)) and dried gels were exposed for autoradiography. The oligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay were as follows, with the core binding site underlined: C/EBP, 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTG-3′ and 3′-GTCTAACGCGTTAGACG-5′; ST3-C/EBP, 5′-CTAGACCATTGAGCAAGACCCT-3′ and 3′-TGGTAACTCGTTCTGGGAGATC-5′; ST3-C/EBPm, 5′-CTAGACCATTGGCAAGACCCT-3′ and 3′-TGGTAACCGTTCTGGGAGATC-5′; and AP-1, 5′-AGCTTATGAGTCACA-3′ and 3′-ATACTCAGTGTGATC-5′. Luciferase constructs containing various lengths of ST3 promoter were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification from a 5.5-kb XhoI/NotI genomic template (23Anglard P. Melot T. Guérin E. Thomas G. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and insertion into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-Basic, Promega Corp.). Sequences of the three 5′-primers used are as follows (with restriction sites underlined): 5′-CGGGGTACCTGGCCTGAAATGCCTAC-3′ for 2.5-ST3-LUC (−2447 to +15), 5′-CGGGGTACCAAGATCACACCATTGAGCAAG-3′ for 2.5-ΔAP1-LUC (−2179 to +15) and 5′-CGGGGTACCGGGCCGCGGCTGCTAGGAGAGTTC-3′ for 0.1-ST3-LUC (−110 to +15). The 3′-primer 5′-CCATCCGCCTCGAGGCTGCTGGGCTTGCTGG-3′ was used for the amplification of all three ST3 promoter fragments, which were digested with KpnI and XhoI and ligated into pGL3-Basic plasmid digested with the same restriction enzymes. Isolated ST3-C/EBP and ST3-C/EBPm sequences were cloned into the NheI restriction site of the luciferase pGL3-Promoter (Promega Corp.) containing the SV40 promoter and were designated ST3-C/EBP-SV40-LUC and ST3-C/EBPm-SV40-LUC. The double-stranded oligonucleotides with 5′XbaI overhangs used for both constructs are indicated above. RD cells were transiently transfected in 6-well plates by the calcium phosphate procedure, as described previously (23Anglard P. Melot T. Guérin E. Thomas G. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using 2.5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmids and 0.25 μg of pCH110 plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA transfected in each culture well was made up to 5 μg with pBluescribe plasmid DNA. 6 h after transfection, the DNA precipitate was eliminated, and the cells were further incubated for 24 or 48 h and lysed in 150 μl of Passive Lysis buffer (Promega), whereas cell debris were removed by centrifugation. Cell extracts (50 μl) were assayed for Luciferase activity using the luciferin reagent (Promega). Light intensity was measured in a EG&G Berthold luminometer. All transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated three or four times. Results were normalized for protein content (light units/μg of protein). To determine the mechanism by which high levels of ST3 can be induced, we first examined the induction kinetics of ST3 mRNA in human fibroblasts exposed to TPA. As a variety of MMPs are expressed in this cellular type in vivo and in vitro, this kinetics was compared with that of interstitial collagenase whose AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation has been well documented (31Vincenti M.P. White L.A. Schroen D.J. Benbow U. Brinckerhoff C.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 391-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the induction pattern of both genes is clearly different. The interstitial collagenase gene is rapidly and highly induced within the first hours following fibroblast exposure to TPA, with a 40-fold increase measured after 21 h of incubation. This induction is transient, and maximal levels of interstitial collagenase mRNA levels fall off after 24 h. In contrast, ST3 gene induction by TPA is delayed, leading to maximal mRNA levels after 35 h where a 20-fold increase was observed. This stimulatory effect is sustained, and the levels of ST3 transcripts remain stable at least until 60 h. The prolonged lag period of about 10 h during which low levels of ST3 transcripts were detected following exposure to TPA suggested the requirement ofde novo protein synthesis. To test this hypothesis, HFL1 fibroblasts were cultured in the presence or absence of TPA for a period of 32 h, and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was added either during the whole incubation time (32 h) or during the last 18 or 8 h. As shown in Fig. 2, the induction of ST3 mRNA expression by TPA (lane 2) was not observed when cycloheximide was added together with TPA for 32 h (lane 6). Consistent with this observation, the levels of ST3 mRNA observed after 14 h exposure to TPA (Fig. 1,right panel) were not further induced when cycloheximide was added for an extra period of 18 h (lane 7). In marked contrast, we found by hybridizing the same Northern blot that the stimulation of interstitial collagenase mRNA was not affected by the addition of cycloheximide (compare lane 2 withlanes 6–8). These results demonstrate that protein synthesis is required for ST3 but not for interstitial collagenase mRNA induction by TPA, indicating that these genes are regulated by different mechanisms. The maintenance of high levels of ST3 transcripts after a long exposure of HFL1 fibroblasts to TPA (Fig. 1) prompted us to evaluate ST3 mRNA stability in transcriptionally arrested cells. The transcription elongation inhibitor DRB was first tested on the fibroblastic expression of ST3 to establish the optimal concentration required to arrest transcription. The time interval between 15 and 30 h of fibroblast exposure to TPA was chosen for this analysis, because it corresponds to a maximal increase in ST3 mRNA levels (Fig. 1). DRB was found to completely block ST3 mRNA induction at concentrations over 25 μm(Fig. 3). Interestingly, the degradation of interstitial collagenase mRNA occurring normally after its induction by TPA was not observed in the presence of DRB concentration over 25 μm, indicating that it was also under the control of a transcriptional mechanism. We next used 75 μm DRB to arrest transcription to determine whether the stability of ST3 mRNA was modified in HFL1 fibroblasts exposed to TPA. Fibroblasts were cultured for 32 h in the presence or absence of TPA, and DRB was then added for up to an additional 40 h. The decay of ST3 mRNA was monitored by Northern blot analysis. Because of the low constitutive levels of ST3 mRNA in control cells, 30 μg of total RNA was analyzed for each evaluation performed in the absence of TPA. We found that the slow decay of ST3 mRNA observed in control cells (Fig. 4 A) was very similar to that observed in cells stimulated with TPA (Fig. 4 B). Indeed, the half-life of ST3 mRNA estimated during the first 28 h following DRB addition was approximately 18 h in both conditions. We therefore concluded that ST3 mRNA induction by TPA could not be attributed to a mechanism involving mRNA stabilization. The lack of TPA effect on ST3 mRNA stability suggested that TPA was inducing ST3 gene expression by a transcriptional mechanism. We therefore performed nuclear run-on assays to directly assess the rate of ST3 gene transcription and compared it to that of the interstitial collagenase gene. HFL1 fibroblasts were exposed to TPA for 0–48 h. Nuclei were isolated, and radiolabeled RNAs resulting from the in vitro elongation of nascent nuclear RNA transcripts were hybridized to blotted denatured cDNAs cloned into the pBluescript II vector and corresponding to interstitial collagenase, ST3, the housekeeping gene 36B4 (32Masiakowski P. Breathnach R. Bloch J. Gannon F. Krust A. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7895-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), and the plasmid alone as a control for nonspecific hybridization. As shown in Fig. 5 A, TPA was found to increase the transcription rate of both ST3 and interstitial collagenase genes with kinetics consistent with those observed for their mRNA levels evaluated simultaneously (Fig. 5 B). The transcriptional rate of the interstitial collagenase gene was transiently increased and peaked at 16 h of TPA treatment. In contrast, whereas the basal transcription rate of the ST3 gene was similar to that of the 36B4 gene, its transcription rate was higher at all incubation times in the presence of TPA. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the induction of both ST3 and interstitial collagenase genes by TPA occurs through a transcriptional mechanism in HFL1 fibroblasts. Having established that the mechanism by which TPA induces ST3 gene expression was transcriptional, we were interested in the identification of regulatory sequences that could account for this induction. However, because HFL1 fibroblasts are resistant to transient transfection, we looked for alternative cells expressing ST3 that could be transfected for promoter studies. As the transcriptional activation of ST3 by retinoic acid in HFL1 has been recently shown to be similar in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells (15Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we first tested whether TPA could also induce expression"

Cysteine mutagenesis in combination with homology modeling has been used to study the determinants of kainate binding in a glutamate receptor subtype, a low molecular weight goldfish kainate-binding protein, GFKARβ. A construct of GFKARβ with no cysteines in the extracellular domain was produced, and single cysteine residues were introduced at selected positions. N-Ethylmaleimide or derivatized methanethiosulfonate reagents (neutral or charged) were used to modify the introduced cysteines covalently, and the effect on [3H]kainate binding was determined. In addition, cysteine mutants of GFKARβ transiently expressed in HEK293 cells were labeled with a membrane-impermeable biotinylating reagent followed by precipitation with streptavidin beads and specific detection of GFKARβ by Western blot analysis. The results are consistent with the proposal that the energy driving kainate binding is contributed both from residues within the binding site and from interactions between two regions (i.e. two lobes) of the protein that are brought into contact upon ligand binding in a manner analogous to that seen in bacterial amino acid-binding proteins.

Bridges R.J. Cotman C.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1989; 29: 365-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). GluRs consist of two large superfamilies of membrane-bound receptors: (i) metabotropic receptors, which are linked by G proteins to second messengers such as phospholipase C, and (ii) ionotropic receptors (iGluRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels. The iGluRs have been subdivided based upon agonist sensitivity and sequence homology into three subfamilies (2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol.

For all these subtypes, some uncertainty exists over the subunit stoichiometry; each receptor is thought to be composed of either four (4Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F.

From homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, six regions (R1–R6; Fig. 1 B) were suggested to contribute to the binding site. The three-dimensional structure of the S1S2 domain of GluR2 has been solved recently by x-ray crystallography (27Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Although differences exist between the crystal structure and previous homology models, the overall structure and many of the contributions to the binding site were predicted correctly. With the availability of a three-dimensional structure of GluR2, mutagenesis studies are particularly interesting for comparing different subtypes and for testing the importance of specific interactions. In particular, the static crystal structure of the agonist-bound form suggests that the two lobes comprising the S1S2 domain may close to surround the ligand upon binding, but further evidence is required to demonstrate this experimentally.Cysteine mutagenesis is an extremely useful tool for probing structural features of proteins (28Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 29Kuner T. Wollmuth L.P. Karlin A. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B.

Postexpression modifications of the protein can then be made by treatment with a sulfhydryl reagent, and the accessibility of the introduced thio-group can be tested by labeling with a biotinylating reagent. We have been using the kainate-binding proteins (GFKARα and GFKARβ; Ref. 30Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7154-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) from goldfish brain as model systems for understanding the ligand-binding site of iGluRs (31Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 770-780PubMed Google Scholar). As described here, a construct of GFKARβ with high affinity kainate binding can be produced with no cysteines in the extracellular portion of the protein. Thus, a single cysteine can be introduced without the possibility of forming disulfide bonds, which could in turn lead to a misfolded protein. Cysteine mutations were designed to probe protein-ligand interactions and sites of interaction between the S1 and S2 lobes. The results are interpreted in terms of a model of GFKARβ, which is based on homology with GluR2.DISCUSSIONThe model of GFKARβ built based on the GluR2 S1S2 domain template can guide the interpretation of mutagenesis studies, help to demonstrate differences in subtypes, and provide information on conformational changes upon binding. Both mutagenesis studies and the GluR2 structure suggest that agonist affinity is controlled by two classes of residues: (i) those that are found in the binding site interacting with ligand and (ii) those that are involved in interlobe contacts, which in turn can affect the energetics of lobe closure and therefore indirectly affect ligand binding. Homology modeling of glutamate receptors based on bacterial amino acid-binding proteins identified six regions (R1–R6) thought to form the binding site (18Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Methods Enzymology. 1998; 293: 589-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,19Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Of those regions, R2, R3, R4, and R6 are found in the binding site. Amino acids in R1, R2, R4, and R5 are involved in interlobe contacts.Binding SiteConsidering first the residues that line the binding pocket (Fig. 5 B), most determinants of binding seem to be well conserved across iGluR subtypes. In R2, Tyr52 interacts with the pyrrolidine ring and isopropenyl groups of kainate (27Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and mutation to serine (but not phenylalanine) completely eliminates binding activity (31Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 770-780PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid at this position is tyrosine or phenylalanine in all iGluRs. In R3, a highly conserved arginine residue (Arg86) forms a salt bridge to the α-carboxyl group of kainate. In an AMPA receptor, the modification of the homologous Arg (Arg507) to Lys was sufficient to abolish binding (37Uchino S. Sakimura K. Nagahari K. Mishina M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38Lampinen M. Pentikainen O. Johnson M.S. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4704-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The homologous mutation in the chick kainate-binding protein also completely abolished binding, although this residue was excluded from the binding site in the model of that protein (20Paas Y. Eisenstein M. Medevielle F. Teichberg V.I. Devillers-Thiery A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 979-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).In R4, T247 interacts with the carboxymethyl group of kainate, and mutation of this residue to cysteine, as described above, completely abolishes binding but not expression of the protein. In the model, Ser245 is also in a position to form a hydrogen bond with the carboxymethyl group of kainate. The equivalent position in GluR2 is Gly653. Mutation of Ser245 to cysteine decreases binding affinity by 4–5-fold relative to βΔC5, suggesting that this hydrogen bond could form but that its contribution to the binding energy is less than Thr247. Modification of βS245C with NEM and the MTS reagents reveals an interesting pattern (Fig. 3 B). MMTS, MTSEA, and MTSET significantly reduce binding, but negatively charged MTSES has no effect. This is a bit surprising because the MTSES-modified S245C would be in a position to interact with Arg86 (the residue in R3 that forms the salt bridge with the 2-carboxyl group of kainate) and the amide of Gly53. The negative charge could interfere with binding both because of its proximity to the kainate carboxyl and its putative interaction with R86. However, as shown in Fig. 5 C, MTSES can be positioned so as to allow kainate to bind. In contrast, the positively charged MTSET can lie in the same position as the amide of kainate (Fig. 5 D), thereby blocking the binding site. Interestingly, βS245C can be labeled with biotin-HPDP both in the presence and absence of kainate. This would suggest that at least in the cysteine mutant, position 245 is solvent exposed in the bound complex. Thus, Ser245 is likely to contribute only a small amount of binding energy and, because the equivalent position is glycine in AMPA receptors as well as GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7, its role may be unique to kainate-binding proteins.The highly conserved Glu293 in R6 coordinates the amino group of kainate. βS296C has no effect on kainate affinity, but modification by sulfhydryl reagents significantly affects binding. As shown in Fig. 3 B, NEM and the MTS reagents (with the exception of MMTS) dramatically decrease kainate binding. Presumably, this is a steric effect because MMTS is the smallest reagent used, and both positively and negatively charged reagents have the same effect. The side chain is predicted to point directly into the binding site and could easily block the binding of kainate (Fig. 5 E). As indicated by inhibition of biotin-HPDP labeling by kainate, glutamate, and CNQX, this site is no longer solvent exposed in the presence of agonist or antagonist.Interlobe InterfaceThe interlobe interface consists of several points of contact that can affect the ligand specificity allosterically (21Swanson G.T. Gereau R.W. Green T. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1997; 19: 913-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 27Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Two points of contact have been identified in the crystal structure of GluR2 (27Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and consist of contacts between R1 and R5 and between R2 and R4. In GluR2, the corresponding contacts are Glu402-Thr686 and Lys449-Asp651-Ser652. The fact that GFKARβ has a Gln (Gln12) corresponding to Glu402 and an Ala (Ala51) corresponding to Lys449 could provide additional insight into this interface. Q12E results in an increase in kainate affinity (31Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 770-780PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that, as with the equivalent residue Glu402 in GluR2, this residue could be involved in interlobe interactions. Inspection of the model suggests that a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Met276 (the position equivalent to Thr686 of GluR2, Fig. 1 B) is the most likely interaction and that interaction with Ser275 is unlikely. The latter is consistent with other experiments; with Gln in position 12, βS275C does not affect kainate affinity, nor does modification of βS275C by NEM. Both βD13C and βS275C are occluded upon agonist binding in that they are no longer available for biotin-HPDP labeling in the presence of either agonist or antagonist. This is consistent with the positioning of these residues outside of the binding site but at the domain interface. The fact that the sites are exposed in the absence but not the presence of agonist and antagonist is suggestive of a domain closure similar to that seen in bacterial amino acid-binding proteins. Because Ser275 is analogous to the position in GluR6 that controls AMPA affinity (21Swanson G.T. Gereau R.W. Green T. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1997; 19: 913-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the differences in agonist affinity between AMPA and kainate receptors maybe be at least partially because of allosteric interactions at the interlobe interface rather than to direct contact with ligand.βA51K decreases the binding affinity for kainate by 2.5-fold (31Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 770-780PubMed Google Scholar). NEM treatment of βA51C decreases kainate affinity by approximately 3-fold (Fig. 2 B). Perhaps surprisingly, however, MTSEA and MTSET have no effect on βA51C (Fig. 5 B). This suggests that the aliphatic chain of these two reagents could produce a hydrophobic interaction that cannot be produced by the shorter aliphatic chain of lysine. Linked to this hypothesis, the model also suggests the possibility that the charged groups on the longer MTSEA and MTSET could interact with Asp56, whereas a lysine could not reach this far. Thus, at least in the case of kainate binding, the putative interaction between the lobes at this site does not extensively affect ligand affinity. This is supported by the finding that βA51C was accessible to biotin-HPDP in the presence and absence of kainate, suggesting that, at least in its unmodified form, conformational changes resulting from ligand binding do not affect the solvent accessibility of this residue.βS271CPosition 271 is predicted to be neither in the binding site nor at the interdomain interface. Nevertheless, the βS271C mutation decreased binding affinity by more than 4-fold. Likewise, the labeling by biotin-HPDP is decreased in the presence of kainate and glutamate and consistently less so with CNQX. Similar results have been observed in GluR6 (34Basiry S.S. Mendoza P. Lee P.D. Raymond L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 644-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this position is at the end of a stretch of relatively low homology between GFKARβ and GluR2, it is almost certainly located in the loop between the G and H helices and is outside of the cleft that defines both the binding site and the interface between the two lobes. The postulated conformational change, which accompanies binding and which is based on homology with bacterial amino acid-binding proteins, is assumed to be a closure of the two lobes. Because the conformational change decreases the solvent accessibility of Ser271, which is neither at the binding site nor the interlobe interface, a modification of the structure of at least lobe 2 is likely to take place in addition to the lobe closure. Thus, conformational changes accompanying binding likely involve more than a rigid body movement of the two lobes relative to each other and may differ for agonists and antagonists. This position is of particular interest because in GluR6, a mutation to alanine abolishes the effects of cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation (39Raymond L.A. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,40Wang L.Y. Taverna F.A. Huang X.P. MacDonald J.F. Hampson D.R.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 374-380PubMed Google Scholar). The results of these studies have provided valuable information that was an indispensable component in the development of homology models (17Sutcliffe M.J. Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1575-1589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E.

Trans. 1998; 26: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the interpretation of mutagenesis results are complicated by two factors: (i) In some cases, differential effects of mutations at homologous sites of different subtypes occurred. For example, E424Q and E424A of GluRD (GluR4; Ref. 38Lampinen M. Pentikainen O. Johnson M.S. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4704-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) did not affect kainate binding, but the homologous E33V mutation of chick kainate-binding protein decreased kainate binding by greater than 10-fold (20Paas Y. Eisenstein M. Medevielle F. Teichberg V.I. Devillers-Thiery A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 979-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the homologous Q12E mutant of GFKARβ increased affinity for kainate and glutamate (31Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 770-780PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) The loss of binding activity cannot be unambiguously interpreted as a loss of a specific interaction in the binding site because it could equally be because of a large structural disturbance. In the case of a model of the chick kainate-binding protein (20Paas Y. Eisenstein M. Medevielle F. Teichberg V.I. Devillers-Thiery A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 979-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), some key residues with dramatic effects on ligand binding (e.g. Arg107 and Glu316) were placed outside of the binding site, resulting in a model of the binding site with no positively charged residues and based on hydrogen bonding alone. Cysteine substitution mutagenesis can partially overcome some of the problems of standard mutagenesis. Assuming that the mutation to cysteine does not greatly affect binding and that the cysteine is accessible for modification, the effects of cysteine modification are less likely to result in misfolding of the protein. Furthermore, a single mutation can be modified by a variety of sulfhydryl reagents to test the effects of positive and negative charges. Thus, cysteine mutagenesis is a useful complement to standard mutagenesis, homology modeling, and direct structural analysis.SummaryWith the availability of an atomic resolution structure of GluR2, which has considerable sequence identity to GFKARβ, and the subsequent production of a model based on the GluR2 structure, the interpretation of the cysteine mutants and their modification by sulfhydryl reagents as well as site-directed mutagenesis can be made with a much higher level of confidence than has been previously possible. The results support the notion that the energy for binding kainate is contributed both by essential residues in the binding site as well as by allosteric interactions between two distinct regions of the protein. The use of biotin-HPDP to assess the solvent accessibility of each cysteine substitution provided additional information on the conformational changes associated with binding. The findings support previous suggestions that the closure of the two lobes accompanies binding (8Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 16Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar); however, the changes in the accessibility of position 271 suggest that the closure of the lobe likely involves more than a rigid body movement of the lobes. Furthermore, based on the inhibition of biotin labeling for residues 13 and 275, the lobe closure can occur both upon binding of agonist and antagonist, suggesting that a more subtle conformational change may be associated with gating. Glutamate receptors (GluRs)1 are the major excitatory receptors in the vertebrate central nervous system and have been implicated in a number of normal and pathologic processes including synaptic plasticity, epilepsy, and ischemic cell death (1Monaghan D.T. Bridges R.J. Cotman C.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1989; 29: 365-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). GluRs consist of two large superfamilies of membrane-bound receptors: (i) metabotropic receptors, which are linked by G proteins to second messengers such as phospholipase C, and (ii) ionotropic receptors (iGluRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels. The iGluRs have been subdivided based upon agonist sensitivity and sequence homology into three subfamilies (2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3649) Google Scholar): (i)N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (R1–3), (ii) α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (GluR1–4), and (iii) kainate receptors (GluR5–7, KA1–2, and kainate-binding proteins from nonmammalian vertebrates). For all these subtypes, some uncertainty exists over the subunit stoichiometry; each receptor is thought to be composed of either four (4Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 5Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2954-2961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mano I. Teichberg V.I.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) subunits that form functional ion channels in the cell membrane. iGluRs have a distinct modular structure (Fig. 1 A and Ref. 8Wo Z.G.
