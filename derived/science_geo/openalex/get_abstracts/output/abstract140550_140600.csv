https://openalex.org/W2161659751,"The discriminatory capacity of the mammalian olfactory system is such that thousands of volatile chemicals are perceived as having distinct odors. Here we used a combination of calcium imaging and single-cell RT–PCR to identify odorant receptors (ORs) for odorants with related structures but varied odors. We found that one OR recognizes multiple odorants and that one odorant is recognized by multiple ORs, but that different odorants are recognized by different combinations of ORs. Thus, the olfactory system uses a combinatorial receptor coding scheme to encode odor identities. Our studies also indicate that slight alterations in an odorant, or a change in its concentration, can change its “code,” potentially explaining how such changes can alter perceived odor quality."

https://openalex.org/W1970006170,"Quantum key distribution is widely thought to offer unconditional security in communication between two users. Unfortunately, a widely accepted proof of its security in the presence of source, device and channel noises has been missing. This long-standing problem is solved here by showing that, given fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum key distribution over an arbitrarily long distance of a realistic noisy channel can be made unconditionally secure. The proof is reduced from a noisy quantum scheme to a noiseless quantum scheme and then from a noiseless quantum scheme to a noiseless classical scheme, which can then be tackled by classical probability theory."
https://openalex.org/W1976273464,"Telomere maintenance is thought to play a role in signaling cellular senescence; however, a link with organismal aging processes has not been established. The telomerase null mouse provides an opportunity to understand the effects associated with critical telomere shortening at the organismal level. We studied a variety of physiological processes in an aging cohort of mTR-/- mice. Loss of telomere function did not elicit a full spectrum of classical pathophysiological symptoms of aging. However, age-dependent telomere shortening and accompanying genetic instability were associated with shortened life span as well as a reduced capacity to respond to stresses such as wound healing and hematopoietic ablation. In addition, we found an increased incidence of spontaneous malignancies. These findings demonstrate a critical role for telomere length in the overall fitness, reserve, and well being of the aging organism."
https://openalex.org/W2003616082,"Recent computational studies of models for manganese oxides have revealed a rich phase diagram, which was not anticipated in early calculations in this context performed in the 1950s and 1960s. In particular, the transition between the antiferromagnetic insulator state of the hole-undoped limit and the ferromagnetic metal at finite hole density was found to occur through a mixed-phase process. When extended Coulomb interactions are included, a microscopically charged inhomogeneous state should be stabilized. These phase separation tendencies, also present at low electronic densities, influence the properties of the ferromagnetic region by increasing charge fluctuations. Experimental data reviewed here by applying several techniques for manganites and other materials are consistent with this scenario. Similarities with results previously discussed in the context of cuprates are clear from this analysis, although the phase segregation tendencies in manganites appear stronger."
https://openalex.org/W2131575598,"Proteins modified by multiubiquitin chains are the preferred substrates of the proteasome. Ubiquitination involves a ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, E2, and often a substrate-specific ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3. Here we show that efficient multiubiquitination needed for proteasomal targeting of a model substrate requires an additional conjugation factor, named E4. This protein, previously known as UFD2 in yeast, binds to the ubiquitin moieties of preformed conjugates and catalyzes ubiquitin chain assembly in conjunction with E1, E2, and E3. Intriguingly, E4 defines a novel protein family that includes two human members and the regulatory protein NOSA from Dictyostelium required for fruiting body development. In yeast, E4 activity is linked to cell survival under stress conditions, indicating that eukaryotes utilize E4-dependent proteolysis pathways for multiple cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1988617344,"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant (UEV) proteins resemble ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) but lack the defining E2 active-site residue. The MMS2-encoded UEV protein has been genetically implicated in error-free postreplicative DNA repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that Mms2p forms a specific heteromeric complex with the UBC13-encoded E2 and is required for the Ubc13p-dependent assembly of polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 63. A ubc13 yeast strain is UV sensitive, and single, double, and triple mutants of the UBC13, MMS2, and ubiquitin (ubiK63R) genes display a comparable phenotype. These findings support a model in which an Mms2p/Ubc13p complex assembles novel polyubiquitin chains for signaling in DNA repair, and they suggest that UEV proteins may act to increase diversity and selectivity in ubiquitin conjugation."
https://openalex.org/W2013538305,"Multipotent and self-renewing neural stem cells have been isolated in culture, but equivalent cells have not yet been prospectively identified in neural tissue. Using cell surface markers and flow cytometry, we have isolated neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) from mammalian fetal peripheral nerve. These cells are phenotypically and functionally indistinguishable from NCSCs previously isolated by culturing embryonic neural tube explants. Moreover, in vivo BrdU labeling indicates that these stem cells self-renew in vivo. NCSCs freshly isolated from nerve tissue can be directly transplanted in vivo, where they generate both neurons and glia. These data indicate that neural stem cells persist in peripheral nerve into late gestation by undergoing self-renewal. Such persistence may explain the origins of some PNS tumors in humans."

The topology of the polyethylene varies from linear with moderate branching to “hyperbranched” structures. Although the overall branching number and the distribution of short-chain branching change very slightly, the architecture or topology of the polyethylene changes from linear polyethylene with moderate branches at high ethylene pressures to a hyperbranched polyethylene at low pressures."
https://openalex.org/W1986349419,"p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are implicated in the cytoskeletal changes induced by the Rho family of guanosine triphosphatases. Cytoskeletal dynamics are primarily modulated by interactions of actin and myosin II that are regulated by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)–mediated phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chain (MLC). p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) phosphorylates MLCK, resulting in decreased MLCK activity. MLCK activity and MLC phosphorylation were decreased, and cell spreading was inhibited in baby hamster kidney–21 and HeLa cells expressing constitutively active PAK1. These data indicate that MLCK is a target for PAKs and that PAKs may regulate cytoskeletal dynamics by decreasing MLCK activity and MLC phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1988504791,"Key species interactions that are sensitive to temperature may act as leverage points through which small changes in climate could generate large changes in natural communities. Field and laboratory experiments showed that a slight decrease in water temperature dramatically reduced the effects of a keystone predator, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, on its principal prey. Ongoing changes in patterns of cold water upwelling, associated with El Nino events and longer term geophysical changes, may thus have far-reaching impacts on the composition and diversity of these rocky intertidal communities."

https://openalex.org/W2082773871,"Sprouty was identified in a genetic screen as an inhibitor of Drosophila EGF receptor signaling. The Egfr triggers cell recruitment in the eye, and sprouty- eyes have excess photoreceptors, cone cells, and pigment cells. Sprouty's function is, however, more widespread. We show that it also interacts genetically with the receptor tyrosine kinases Torso and Sevenless, and it was first discovered through its effect on FGF receptor signaling. In contrast to an earlier proposal that Sprouty is extracellular, we show by biochemical analysis that Sprouty is an intracellular protein, associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Sprouty binds to two intracellular components of the Ras pathway, Drk and Gap1. Our results indicate that Sprouty is a widespread inhibitor of Ras pathway signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1964739066,"Dysregulation of Wnt–β-catenin signaling disrupts axis formation in vertebrate embryos and underlies multiple human malignancies. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, axin, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β form a Wnt-regulated signaling complex that mediates the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of β-catenin. A protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulatory subunit, B56, interacted with APC in the yeast two-hybrid system. Expression of B56 reduced the abundance of β-catenin and inhibited transcription of β-catenin target genes in mammalian cells and Xenopus embryo explants. The B56-dependent decrease in β-catenin was blocked by oncogenic mutations in β-catenin or APC, and by proteasome inhibitors. B56 may direct PP2A to dephosphorylate specific components of the APC-dependent signaling complex and thereby inhibit Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1971510126,"Transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling is mediated by a complex of type I (TBRI) and type II (TBRII) receptors. The type III receptor (TBRIII) lacks a recognizable signaling domain and has no clearly defined role in TGF-β signaling. Cardiac endothelial cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transformation express TBRIII, and here TBRIII-specific antisera were found to inhibit mesenchyme formation and migration in atrioventricular cushion explants. Misexpression of TBRIII in nontransforming ventricular endothelial cells conferred transformation in response to TGF-β2. These results support a model where TBRIII localizes transformation in the heart and plays an essential, nonredundant role in TGF-β signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2036254362,"Entry of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium into host cells requires membrane ruffling and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, it is shown that the bacterial protein SipA plays a critical role in this process. SipA binds directly to actin, decreases its critical concentration, and inhibits depolymerization of actin filaments. These activities result in the spatial localization and more pronounced outward extension of the Salmonella-induced membrane ruffles, thereby facilitating bacterial uptake."

https://openalex.org/W2021109304,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to its receptor causes rapid phosphorylation of the clathrin heavy chain at tyrosine 1477, which lies in a domain controlling clathrin assembly. EGF-mediated clathrin phosphorylation is followed by clathrin redistribution to the cell periphery and is the product of downstream activation of SRC kinase by EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling. In cells lacking SRC kinase, or cells treated with a specific SRC family kinase inhibitor, EGF stimulation of clathrin phosphorylation and redistribution does not occur, and EGF endocytosis is delayed. These observations demonstrate a role for SRC kinase in modification and recruitment of clathrin during ligand-induced EGFR endocytosis and thereby define a novel effector mechanism for regulation of endocytosis by receptor signaling."

Here, a dynamic marker of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) activation is identified and exploited. Activation of PKCα is detected through the binding of fluorescently tagged phosphorylation site–specific antibodies; the consequent FRET is measured through the donor fluorophore on PKCα by FLIM. This approach enabled the imaging of PKCα activation in live and fixed cultured cells and was also applied to pathological samples."

https://openalex.org/W2030329289,"Measurements from the winter of 1994–95 indicating removal of total reactive nitrogen from the Arctic stratosphere by particle sedimentation were used to constrain a microphysical model. The model suggests that denitrification is caused predominantly by nitric acid trihydrate particles in small number densities. The denitrification is shown to increase Arctic ozone loss substantially. Sensitivity studies indicate that the Arctic stratosphere is currently at a threshold of denitrification. This implies that future stratospheric cooling, induced by an increase in the anthropogenic carbon dioxide burden, is likely to enhance denitrification and to delay until late in the next century the return of Arctic stratospheric ozone to preindustrial values."
https://openalex.org/W2107813980,"We have cloned human protein kinase Bγ (PKBγ) and found that it contains two regulatory phosphorylation sites, Thr305 and Ser472, which correspond to Thr308 and Ser473 of PKBα. Thus it differs significantly from the previously published rat PKBγ. We have also isolated a similar clone from a mouse cDNA library. In human tissues, PKBγ is widely expressed as two transcripts. A mutational analysis of the two regulatory sites of human PKBγ showed that phosphorylation of both sites, occurring in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent manner, is required for full activity. Our results suggest that the two phosphorylation sites act in concert to produce full activation of PKBγ, similar to PKBα.

Only a few studies have been reported on the third member of the PKB family, PKBγ, and these all involved a clone originating from a rat brain cDNA library (4Konishi H. Kuroda S. Tanaka M.

Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A major feature distinguishing rat PKBγ from the otherwise very similar α and β isoforms is the C terminus, which is truncated by 23 amino acids and lacks Ser473/474, one of the two phosphorylation sites essential for activation of PKBα and β (15Alessi D.R.

Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30491-30497Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Consequently, it has been suggested that rat PKBγ activation depends solely on the upstream kinase PDK1. We now report the cloning and characterization of human PKBγ. This isoform differs significantly from the rat enzyme in that it contains a C-terminal domain similar to PKBα/β, with a putative second regulatory phosphorylation site at Ser472. A 525-bp PCR product corresponding to nucleotides 815–1340 of the rat PKBγ sequence (4Konishi H. Kuroda S. Tanaka M. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Twelve overlapping clones were isolated and assembled to a cDNA encoding amino acids 16–479 of human PKBγ. This cDNA was repaired by PCR-mediated addition of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag and the missing N-terminal amino acids deduced from the rat PKBγ sequence and ligated as aKpnI/XbaI fragment into the pCMV5 eucaryotic expression vector (27Andersson S. Davis D.N. Dahlback H. Jornwall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the 5′ end of PKBγ was amplified by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends from human brain cDNA. A mouse brain cDNA library screened with the same probe yielded 13 overlapping clones which could be assembled into a cDNA encoding the entire reading frame of mouse PKBγ. Mutations in HA-PKBγ (HA-PKBγT305A and HA-PKBγT305D) were done by Quikchange (Stratagene) or with mutagenizing 3′ primers (HA-PKBγS472A and HA-PKBγS472D). HA-ΔPHPKBγ was obtained by PCR with a primer encoding the HA-tag and amino acids 119–126. All PCR-cloned constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Human adult and fetal multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with a 825-bp fragment encoding amino acids 110–384 of PKBγ according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained and transfected by a modified calcium phosphate method as described previously (15Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N.

Pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (200 nm; gift of Dr. Markus Thelen, Theodor Kocher Institute, Bern, Switzerland) was for 15 min.

Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar) and developed with the polyclonal phospho-specific Ser473antibody (1:1000, New England Biolabs), an alkaline phosphatase (AP)-coupled goat-anti mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:2000, Sigma), and alkaline phosphatase color development reagents (Boehringer Mannheim). Screening of several human cDNA libraries led to the isolation of 12 clones encoding partial and overlapping sections of the open reading frame of human PKBγ, and the cDNA was assembled as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 479-residue amino acid sequence of human PKBγ is presented in Fig.1, as an alignment with human PKBα, PKBβ, mouse PKBγ (see below), and with the C-terminal domain of rat PKBγ. Human PKBγ is 83% identical to PKBα, 78% identical to PKBβ, and 99% identical to rat PKBγ (two changes in 451 amino acids and a different C terminus), indicating that we have isolated the authentic human PKBγ isoform and not a PKBα or PKBβ variant. Moreover, we cloned a similar PKBγ from a mouse brain cDNA library, demonstrating that this isoform is not restricted to one species. Human and mouse PKBγ were found to be more than 99% identical (2 amino acid changes in 479). The major characteristic distinguishing human and mouse PKBγ from the rat isoform is the presence of a C-terminal domain similar to PKBα and β, containing a second putative regulatory phosphorylation site at Ser472(marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1). To ascertain whether the human PKBγ cDNA corresponded to the major mRNA species, we performed 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and found that all 15 clones sequenced, which spanned the C terminus of the protein contained the Ser472 domain. However, human and rat PKBγ diverge in amino acid sequence precisely at a site where an exon boundary has been mapped for the mouse PKBα gene (29Bellacosa A. Franke T.F. Gonzalez-Portal M.E. Datta K. Taguchi T. Gardner J. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 745-754PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the published rat cDNA sequence constitutes a minor splice variant of PKBγ or a partially processed mRNA. To assess the tissue distribution of transcripts encoding PKBγ, we used an isoform-specific radiolabeled cDNA fragment to probe two human multiple tissue Northern blots. Two equally expressed transcripts of 8.5 and 6.5 kilobases were detected in all tissues tested, with highest levels found in adult brain, lung, and kidney and very low levels in heart and liver (Fig.2 A). Two transcripts of similar size were detected in fetal tissues (Fig. 2 B), with high levels found in heart, brain, and liver, but none in the kidney. This observation, and the size of the transcripts, which are much larger than the 3.2–3.4-kilobases transcripts of PKBα/β, 2B. A. Hemmings, unpublished results. indicated the presence of long untranslated regions, and thus the possibility of developmental regulation of expression or post-transcriptional modifications affecting mRNA stability. In contrast to the rat enzyme, human PKBγ contains two predicted regulatory phosphorylation sites, Thr305 in the activation loop, and Ser472 in the C-terminal domain, as does PKBα/β. To determine the importance of these two residues, we mutated them to alanine which cannot be phosphorylated, or to aspartate to mimic the phosphorylated state, and assayed HA-PKBγ kinase activity following transient transfection and stimulation with the insulin mimetic compound pervanadate (Fig.3). The results presented here show that wild type HA-PKBγ, which had a low basal activity, could be stimulated 67-fold by pervanadate treatment; furthermore, mutation of Thr305 to alanine completely ablated activation. No activity above basal levels was observed for HA-PKBγT305A, and the same was true for the double mutant HA-PKBγT305A,S472A. On the other hand, mutation of the C-terminal regulatory site (HA-PKBγS472A) reduced but did not abolish activation by pervanadate (10-fold). We also tested the effects of aspartate mutations, since in the case of PKBα, a double aspartate mutant was constitutively active (15Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). However, PKBγ was not active above basal levels upon mutation of the activation loop site to aspartate (HA-PKBγT305D and HA-PKBγT305D,S472D) and, furthermore, could not be stimulated by pervanadate treatment. Thus the aspartic acid moiety could not substitute for the phosphorylated threonine residue. Again, mutation of Ser472 to aspartate (HA-PKBγS472D) resulted in a protein that could still be activated by pervanadate (35-fold), albeit to a lesser extent than the wild type. These results establish that the phosphorylation site Thr305 in the activation loop is absolutely necessary for activation of PKBγ, with conformational constraints around the active site apparently so stringent that substitution by a negatively charged residue is not tolerated. To determine the role of the C-terminal Ser472 in regulation of human PKBγ, we tested whether activation of HA-PKBγ, HA-PKBγS472A, and HA-PKBγS472D by insulin was sensitive to inhibition of PI3K. Fig. 4 Adepicts the results of a representative experiment, which show that insulin activated HA-PKBγ, HA-PKBγS472D, and, to a lesser extent, HA-PKBγS472A. This stimulation was dependent on the activity of PI3K, since pretreatment of transfected cells with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin inhibited activation by insulin. Furthermore, we subjected the immunoprecipitated proteins to Western blot analysis with an antibody generated specifically against the phosphorylated Ser473 peptide of PKBα (Fig. 4 A, inset). The antibody cross-reacted with HA-PKBγ only upon stimulation with insulin, and phosphorylation of Ser472 was prevented by wortmannin. Since Ser472 was mutated in HA-PKBγS472A and HA-PKBγS472D and could not be phosphorylated, we concluded that the wortmannin-sensitive, insulin-stimulated activity of these proteins was entirely due to phosphorylation at Thr305, dependent on the presence of 3-phosphorylated phospholipids. In this analysis, we also included PKBγ constructs lacking the N-terminal PH domain. In the basal state, this domain is thought to restrict access to the phosphorylation site in the activation loop, thus leaving Thr305 more accessible to phosphorylation by upstream kinases when it is removed. The proteins lacking the PH domain now presented a different picture (Fig. 4 B): HA-ΔPHPKBγ was maximally activated under basal conditions and could not be stimulated further by insulin treatment. This contrasts with results obtained for ΔPHPKBα, shown to be activated by insulin (6Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin led to a reduction in activity of HA-ΔPHPKBγ, indicating that it was still a target for PI3K-dependent phosphorylation. HA-ΔPHPKBγS472A activity was comparable with that of wortmannin-treated HA-ΔPHPKBγ and was not responsive to insulin or wortmannin. In contrast, HA-ΔPHPKBγS472D was again fully active in the absence of stimulation but, unlike HA-ΔPHPKBγ, was not inhibited by wortmannin. The Western blot signals with the phospho-specific Ser473 antibody correlated with the activities observed (Fig. 4 B, inset); HA-ΔPHPKBγ was strongly phosphorylated in extracts of unstimulated and insulin-stimulated cells, but pretreatment with wortmannin reduced the signal. We found previously that transiently transfected PDK1, the upstream kinase phosphorylating Thr308 in PKBα, is active in serum-starved HEK-293 cells. 3M. Andjelkovic and D. Brodbeck, unpublished results. The present results seem to indicate that removal of the PH domain causes a conformational change of PKBγ favorable to phosphorylation at Thr305, so as to make it independent of PI3K activity. Basal activity of PI3K in unstimulated cells allowed phosphorylation of HA-ΔPHPKBγ by the Ser473 kinase, resulting in full activation. Conversely, inhibiting this basal PI3K activity by wortmannin treatment reduced HA-ΔPHPKBγ activity, probably due to the rapid action of phosphatases on phosphorylated Ser472. Thus, HA-ΔPHPKBγ is a model for studying phosphorylation of Ser472, the second regulatory site of human PKBγ, almost independent of Thr305. In summary, we report the cloning and characterization of human PKBγ, a PKB isoform distinct from its rat counterpart in having two regulatory phosphorylation sites, Thr305 and Ser472, both of which are required for full activation of the protein. Our results suggest markedly similar regulation mechanisms for PKBγ and the α and β isoforms, with both upstream kinases phosphorylating the regulatory sites being sensitive to PI3K-derived signals. Furthermore, we found a high abundance of PKBγ mRNAs encoding the C-terminal hydrophobic domain and have isolated a similar mouse PKBγ, showing that this isoform is not restricted to humans. Taken together, we conclude that the truncated rat PKBγ used in all studies so far (26Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) probably constitutes a minor splice variant of endogenous PKBγ protein. The crucial question now emerging is that of the specific roles of the three different PKB isoforms. We thank Drs. M. Andjelkovic, T. Millward, and P. King for comments on the manuscript; P. Mueller for oligonucleotide synthesis; and Dr. H. Angliker for DNA sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2116753046,"The neuroendocrine protein 7B2 has been implicated in activation of prohormone convertase 2 (PC2), an important neuroendocrine precursor processing endoprotease. To test this hypothesis, we created a null mutation in 7B2 employing a novel transposon-facilitated technique and compared the phenotypes of 7B2 and PC2 nulls. 7B2 null mice have no demonstrable PC2 activity, are deficient in processing islet hormones, and display hypoglycemia, hyperproinsulinemia, and hypoglucagonemia. In contrast to the PC2 null phenotype, these mice show markedly elevated circulating ACTH and corticosterone levels, with adrenocortical expansion. They die before 9 weeks of severe Cushing's syndrome arising from pituitary intermediate lobe ACTH hypersecretion. We conclude that 7B2 is indeed required for activation of PC2 in vivo but has additional important functions in regulating pituitary hormone secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2009117933,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an ubiquitous signaling molecule produced from L-arginine by NO synthase (NOS). In the vasculature, NO mediates parasympathetic endothelium-dependent vasodilation. NO may also mediate the parasympathetic control of myocardial function. This is supported by the observations that NOS3, the endothelial constitutive NOS, is expressed in normal cardiac myocytes from rodents and human, and NOS and/or guanylyl cyclase inhibitors antagonize the effect of muscarinic agonists on heart rate, atrio-ventricular conduction, contractility and L-type calcium current. Here we examine the autonomic regulation of the heart in genetically engineered mice deficient in NOS3 (NOS3-KO). We show that the chronotropic and inotropic responses to both beta-adrenergic and muscarinic agonists were unaltered in isolated cardiac tissue preparations from NOS3-KO mice, although these mice have a defective parasympathetic regulation of vascular tone. Similarly, beta-adrenergic stimulation and muscarinic inhibition of the calcium current did not differ in cardiac myocytes from NOS3-KO mice and those from wild-type mice. RT-PCR did not demonstrate upregulation of other NOS isoforms. Similarly, Gi/Go proteins and muscarinic receptor density were unaltered. These data refute the idea that NOS3 is obligatory for the normal autonomic control of cardiac muscle function."

The E5 carboxyl-terminal domain hydrolyzed these tRNAs just on the 3' side of this nucleotide. Tight correlation was observed between the toxicity of E5 and the cleavage of intracellular tRNAs of this group, implying that these tRNAs are the primary targets of colicin E5."

Iron is the only other transition metal that is more abundant in humans; however, if one subtracts the amount of iron in hemoglobin, zinc becomes the most abundant transition metal (1Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 897-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Zinc has been identified as a central component of over 300 enzymes and plays an essential structural function in an entire class of transcription factors. The biological essentiality of zinc implies the existence of homeostatic mechanisms that regulate its absorption, distribution, cellular uptake, and excretion (2Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Phys. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, until recently little was known about how these processes occur within the cell or about the molecules that mediate their action (3Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Metallothionein (MT)1 is an abundant zinc-binding protein and one of the few eukaryotic proteins identified as having an essential role in heavy metal detoxification. Copious levels of MT protein and mRNA are found in organisms and tissues exposed to high levels of zinc or cadmium (4Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the MT genes in response to high concentrations of these potentially toxic metals is mediated through trans-acting proteins that bind to DNA regulatory elements located upstream of the MT gene coding sequences (5Dalton T.D. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 6Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). These metal-responsive elements (MREs) are necessary and sufficient to confer zinc- and cadmium-responsive activation of MT genes (9Culotta V. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Each MT protein molecule may bind up to seven atoms of either zinc or cadmium, where each metal is tetrahedrally coordinated to cysteine residues. Because newly synthesized MT proteins sequester the inducing metals, elevated tissue concentrations of the ions are often detected upon metal exposure (10Richards M.P. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1976; 106: 1591-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11Menard M.P. McCormick C.C. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1981; 111: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Bremner I. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 111-124Google Scholar). Conversely, MT protein and mRNA levels generally decrease in a dose-dependent manner in tissues of animals fed zinc-restrictive diets (13Blalock T.L. Dunn M.A. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1988; 2: 222-228Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Cousins R.J. Lee-Ambrose L.M. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Cui L. Takagi Y. Wasa M.

Additional studies showed that moderate maternal zinc deficiency in rats during pregnancy and lactation results in the reduced expression of MT in the livers of their pups (12Bremner I. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 111-124Google Scholar, 16Gallant K.R. Cherian M.G. Biochem.

Nutr. 1987; 117: 1588-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Such results have led to suggestions that the MT protein may serve to buffer intracellular zinc levels (12Bremner I. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 111-124Google Scholar). We have described the methods used to generate a cell line derived from mouse fibroblasts (L-M(TK−)), herein designated as LTK−, which survives conditions of extreme zinc deprivation (19Suhy D.A. O'Halloran T.V. Sigel A. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 32. Marcel Dekker, Inc., Basel, Switzerland1996: 558-577Google Scholar). Previous attempts at establishing similar zinc-deficient cell lines by other laboratories were unsuccessful in producing a system that would survive beyond a few passages of growth in medium containing less than 0.1 μm zinc (20Minkel D.T. Dolhun P.J. Calhoun B.L. Saryan L.A. Petering D.H. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 2451-2456PubMed Google Scholar, 21Messer H.H. Murray E.J. Goebel N.K. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). This cell line, designated as low zinc-adapted (LZA-LTK−) survives continuous passage in media that contain less than 60 nm zinc and thus provides a useful system to study fundamental components of the cellular machinery responsible for zinc homeostasis. Furthermore, despite continuous culture in these conditions of extreme zinc deprivation, these cells remarkably maintained intracellular zinc at levels comparable with the parental LTK− cell line grown in normal media containing 1–5 μm zinc (19Suhy D.A. O'Halloran T.V. Sigel A. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 32. Marcel Dekker, Inc., Basel, Switzerland1996: 558-577Google Scholar). In this paper, we present evidence that MT plays a role in the maintenance of intracellular zinc at the standard 0.4 fmol zinc/cell level in the LZA-LTK− cells, thus identifying a zinc-scavenging role for the protein. Unlike the studies in which animals were fed zinc-restrictive diets (12Bremner I. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 111-124Google Scholar, 16Gallant K.R. Cherian M.G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Gallant K.R.

Nutr. 1987; 117: 1588-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), MT mRNA is not degraded in the LZA-LTK− cell line; instead, it is constitutively present at high levels. Our results suggest that the overexpression of MT is one step that enhances the survival of the LZA-LTK− cells in conditions of extreme zinc deprivation. BALB/c 3T3 and LTK− cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 5 mm glutamine, and 30,000 units/liter of penicillin/streptomycin (all manufactured by Life Technologies, Inc.). Batch treatments of Chelex (Bio-Rad) were used to strip the media and other solutions of divalent cations. The Chelex resin was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions with neutralization of the resin to physiological pH and multiple washings with 0.25m HEPES, pH 7.4, before its addition to media (at 40 g/liter) and other solutions (at 20 g/liter) with constant stirring at 4 °C for 20–24 h. Aliquots of the solutions were removed prior to and after Chelex treatment, and the concentrations of divalent cations in the samples were determined using an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP-AES) on an Atomscan 25 (Thermo Jarrell Ash) with Thermospec software (version 5.02). Divalent cations other than zinc were restored to their normal concentrations by the addition of appropriate metal chloride salts. Sterilization of the media following Chelex treatment was accomplished by filtering through a 0.2 μm Nylon Media Plus filter unit (Nalgene). LZA-LTK−cells were passaged into zinc-deficient medium supplemented with various concentrations of zinc chloride from a 5 mm stock solution. Following growth, the media were decanted and saved for zinc analysis by ICP-AES. The cells were washed three times with metal-stripped 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (136 mmNaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 10.14 mmNa2HPO4, 1.76 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) to remove the contaminating traces of zinc. The cells were scraped into metal-stripped 1× PBS and were pelleted at 14,000 × g for 1 min. The cell pellet was dried overnight in a 65 °C oven, digested with 150 μl of concentrated nitric acid at 80 °C for 15 min, and diluted to 1.5 ml with distilled H2O prior to analysis on the ICP-AES. RNA was isolated from cell cultures lysed with guanidinium thiocyanate by sedimentation through a cesium chloride cushion (25Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A.

Equivalent amounts of RNA were fractionated on formaldehyde-agarose gels (26Selden R.F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K.

Genomic DNA was purified from cells lysed with SDS/proteinase K solution by phenol/chloroform extraction (27Beach L.R. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). DNA digested with EcoRI was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with radiolabeled mouse MT-I or GAPDH cDNA. The nitrocellulose filters were washed and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. LZA-LTK− cells were grown in various concentrations of zinc ([Zn]media) and labeled with 10 μCi of [35S]cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 24 h. The radioactive media were decanted, and the cells were washed several times with metal-stripped 1× PBS. Cells were scraped into a lysis solution and were vigorously vortexed (27Beach L.R. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). After brief centrifugation to rid the extract of membranes, the soluble extract was carboxymethylated with 12.5 mm iodoacetate, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 50 °C for 15 min (28Lane L.C. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of protein per lane, as determined by the Bradford method, were electrophoresed utilizing Tricine-based PAGE (29Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the gels were fixed, treated with En3hance (DuPont), and dried prior to autoradiography. LZA-LTK− cells that had been grown in various [Zn]media were washed with metal-stripped 1× PBS. Cells were scraped into metal-stripped 1× PBS, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.25 msucrose buffered with 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. Whole cell zinc levels were measured by ICP-AES using an aliquot of the resuspended pellet that had been digested with nitric acid. Other cell aliquots were passed three times through a stainless steel syringe filter holder that was lined with two polycarbonate 16.0-μm filters (Osmonics). β-Hexosaminidase activity assays, which test for the integrity or latency of the organelles, were conducted on aliquots of each homogenate (30Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 203-225Google Scholar). Differential velocity sedimentation resulted in four fractions: 1) P1 (pellet from homogenate spun at 1,000 ×g, 10 min), which typically contains nuclei and unbroken cells; 2) P2 (pellet from the P1 supernatant spun at 10,000 ×g, 10 min) containing large intracellular membranes; 3) P3 (pellet from the P2 supernatant spun at 100,000 × g, 60 min), which typically contains smaller intracellular membranes and vesicles; and 4) the soluble fraction or cytosol (the supernatant from the 100,000 × g, 60-min spin) (31Graham J.M. Dealtry G.B. Rickwood D. Cell Biology LabFax. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992: 7-23Google Scholar). As with the total intracellular zinc measurements, the pellets from each of the fractions were dried overnight, dissolved in concentrated nitric acid, diluted in distilled H2O, and analyzed for zinc content by ICP-AES. Cytosols from subcellular fractionation experiments were chromatographed on a G-75 Sephadex superfine size exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) utilizing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, as the running buffer. In the cadmium saturation analyses, a portion of the cytosol or purified horse MT (Sigma) was incubated with a 5-fold molar excess of cadmium chloride, relative to zinc concentration of the sample, in the presence of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 1 h immediately prior to sample application to the column (32Minkel D.T. Poulsen K. Wielgus S. Shaw C.F. Petering D.H. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 33Pattanaik A. Shaw C.F. Petering D.H. Garvey J. Kraker A.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1994; 54: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Zinc and/or cadmium content of the resultant fractions was measured via ICP-AES. RSV-CAT and MRE-βGeo (a gift of Richard Palmiter) plasmids were transiently transfected into cells via the DEAE-dextran method (34Selden R.F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 9.2.1-9.2.6Google Scholar). After 3 days of growth, cells were harvested and split into samples for the reporter construct assays. The Hoechst 33258 staining assay was used to measure the amounts of DNA per plate of cells (7Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity from the MRE-βGeo was measured as cleavage of anO-nitrophenyl β-galactopyranoside substrate and expressed as A 405 per μg of DNA from the harvested cells. CAT activity from the RSV-CAT construct was measured as the percentage of acetylation of a radiolabeled chloramphenicol substrate (35Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

The ability of the LTK− and LZA-LTK− cell lines to accumulate Zn(II) was examined in response to the addition of a wide range of zinc concentrations in external media ([Zn]media). LTK− cells and LZA-LTK− cells were seeded into unmanipulated media and zinc-stripped media (19Suhy D.A. O'Halloran T.V. Sigel A. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 32. Marcel Dekker, Inc., Basel, Switzerland1996: 558-577Google Scholar), respectively, supplemented with various concentrations of ZnCl2. Following growth to near confluency, samples of the media were collected, and the cells were washed several times with PBS, which had been treated with Chelex to remove residual traces of zinc. Cells from each plate were harvested, counted, and then lysed in concentrated nitric acid. The amount of zinc per cell was determined at each [Zn]media by ICP-AES. Basal levels of intracellular zinc in the parental LTK− cells were measured to be 0.44 ± 0.09 fmol zinc/cell in n = 4 experiments (Fig.1 A). There was little increase in intracellular zinc levels in LTK− cells until [Zn]media exceeded 20 μm. A 3.5-fold increase of intracellular zinc concentration was observed in the presence of the maximum amount of zinc added into the medium (50 μm [Zn]media). Consistent with previous observations (19Suhy D.A. O'Halloran T.V. Sigel A. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 32. Marcel Dekker, Inc., Basel, Switzerland1996: 558-577Google Scholar), LZA-LTK− cells grown in unsupplemented zinc-deficient medium maintained basal intracellular zinc levels (0.54 ± 0.13 fmol zinc/cell n = 4 experiments) similar to those measured in the LTK− cells (Fig. 1 A). As [Zn]media was increased, however, the intracellular zinc levels within the LZA-LTK−cells increased substantially, reaching a maximal level of 8.68 ± 0.86 fmol zinc/cell when [Zn]media was 3.5 μm (a 16-fold increase). Additional zinc supplemented into the media, up to 50 μm, resulted in no further increase in intracellular zinc levels. The concentration of zinc remaining in the spent medium following growth was also measured by ICP-AES (Fig. 1 B). Thedashed line represents the concentration of zinc expected in spent media if the growth of the cells did not significantly perturb [Zn]media; this was the case with the LTK−cell line. Intriguingly, no measurable zinc was observed in the spent media from LZA-LTK− cells grown with [Zn]media < 3.5 μm. Furthermore, there was a striking relationship between the amount of intracellular zinc in LZA-LTK− cells and the concentration of extracellular zinc remaining in spent media (Fig. 1, A and B). Although measurable amounts of metal were added, zinc was undetectable in spent media until the intracellular zinc levels in the LZA-LTK− cells reached the “plateau” level of approximately 8.6 fmol zinc/cell. One interpretation of these data is that zinc-scavenging mechanisms are present in the LZA-LTK− cells that enhance uptake and intracellular sequestration of zinc from the extracellular medium and that this mechanism fills the zinc storage molecules with all available environmental zinc until these sites are saturated. Intracellular metal concentrations of zinc or cadmium are often directly proportional to the amount of MT protein present within cells (36Freedman J.H. Peisach J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 992: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 37Brouwer M. Hausinger R.P. Eichhorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Mechanisms of Metallocenter Assembly. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 235-260Google Scholar, 38Freedman J.H. Weiner R.J. Peisach J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11840-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the LTK− cells, the rate of increase in intracellular zinc levels as a function of [Zn]media is similar to previously published patterns for metal-induced MT gene transcription (39Schroeder J.J. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 844-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the LZA-LTK− cells exhibit a strikingly different intracellular zinc profile in response to increased extracellular zinc. MT mRNA levels were therefore examined in both cell lines to determine what role, if any, MT plays in assisting the cell to scavenge zinc from the media. As expected from previous studies, MT mRNA levels rise in LTK− cells in response to elevated [Zn]media (>20 μm) in a dose-dependent manner that is presumably mediated through transcriptional activation of the MREs (Fig.2 A). A 5-fold induction of MT mRNA was detected between LTK− cells grown in the lowest and highest [Zn]media (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, high, constitutive levels of MT mRNA were present in LZA-LTK− cells regardless of the external [Zn]media (Fig. 2 A). There were no significant [Zn]media-dependent changes in the high levels of MT mRNA in LZA-LTK− cells (Fig.2 B). To determine if the constitutively elevated MT mRNA levels in the LZA-LTK− cells result in correspondingly high steady-state MT protein levels, metabolic labeling studies were conducted. The high cysteine content of MT and relatively low molecular weight (∼10 kDa) make the protein readily detectable in [35S]cysteine labeling experiments. LTK− and LZA-LTK− cells were grown in [Zn]media similar to those used in the RNA and intracellular zinc measurements, and [35S]cysteine was added 24 h prior to harvesting to achieve steady-state labeling. Extracts were carboxymethylated to prevent oxidation of MT sulfhydryl groups (28Lane L.C. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and equivalent amounts of protein were loaded and resolved on Tricine-based SDS-PAGE gels (29Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). In the parental LTK−cell line (Fig. 3 A), increases in [Zn]media lead to increases in MT as well as increases in intracellular zinc and MT RNA levels (Figs. 1 A and2 B, respectively). Each of these parameters remained low until [Zn]media was 20 μm or greater. The increase in MT protein levels occured at lower [Zn]mediain the LZA-LTK− cell line and paralleled the rise in intracellular zinc in LZA-LTK− cells at each [Zn]media (Fig. 1 B). Grown at a wide range of [Zn]media, the amount of MT protein in cells grown in the lower zinc concentrations was relatively low. It is possible that differential translation rates of the MT mRNA might contribute to the differences in MT protein abundance in the LZA-LTK−cell line at the different [Zn]media conditions. However, it is more likely that differences in the rates of degradation of the apoprotein and the metal-bound protein account for the observed steady-state protein levels. Specifically, Klaassen et al.(40Klaassen C.D. Choudhuri S. McKim J.M. Lehman-McKeeman L.D. Kershaw W.C. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 207-224Google Scholar) have shown in proteolysis experiments performed in lysosomal extracts that apo-MT, MT complexed with Cd(II), or MT complexed with Zn(II) had rates of degradation of 50, 200, 35, and 20 pmol/mg of lysosomal protein/min, respectively. Thus, in the absence of enough saturating metal to stabilize the protein, it is expected that apo-MT will be rapidly proteolyzed in the LZA-LTK− cells. To test whether restriction of zinc availability leads to rapid proteolytic turnover of MT protein, LZA-LTK− cells grown in 20 μm [Zn]media and labeled for 24 h with [35S]cysteine were exposed to the intracellular metal-ion chelator TPEN or the extracellular agents EDTA and EGTA for various lengths of times. Dose-dependent and time-dependent degradation of MT protein occurred in cells treated with the intracellular chelator TPEN (Fig.4). The t 1/2 of MT in cells treated with TPEN was approximately 90 min, while thet 1/2 for MT in the untreated cells was greater than the 4-h experiment. Other labeled proteins were not affected by TPEN, suggesting that MT degradation is due to metal chelation and not general degradation of all proteins. EDTA and EGTA, unable to traverse the plasma membrane because of negatively charged moieties, had no effect on the labeled MT although both have high affinities for zinc. To determine if MT protein was directly involved in the increased zinc, the distribution of intracellular zinc accumulation in the LZA-LTK− cell line at various [Zn]media concentrations was examined. Cells grown in various [Zn]media were subjected to subcellular fractionation following disruption of the plasma membrane by extrusion through polycarbonate membranes with pore sizes slightly smaller than the diameters of the cells. Latency, a measurement of the structural integrity of cellular organelles, was examined by β-hexosaminidase enzyme activity measurements on aliquots from the postnuclear supernatants (30Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 203-225Google Scholar). Only samples with greater than 90% latency were used in subsequent procedures to ensure that the distribution of zinc among the fractions was not altered by contamination from disrupted organelles. Additionally, a wide variety of buffers were utilized to ensure that zinc was not being chelated from the organelle fractions (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation by differential velocity centrifugation was used to partition the homogenate into four fractions (31Graham J.M. Dealtry G.B. Rickwood D. Cell Biology LabFax. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992: 7-23Google Scholar). ICP-AES analyses (Fig. 5 A and TableI) demonstrated that the majority of the zinc taken up by the cells at increasing [Zn]media is found in the cytosol. Additionally, there were small, but measurable, increases in the other membranous compartments (Table I).Table IAll values listed are given as fmol of zinc/cell[Zn]mediumP1P2P3CytosolLZA-LTK−<60 nM0.0770.012NAaNot available; below detection limit of ICP.0.0441.0 μm0.0340.0110.0400.3572.5 μm0.0800.0390.0601.3085.0 μm0.1680.0450.0752.84910.0 μm0.2130.0820.1864.70825.0 μm0.2580.0570.1694.75150.0 μm0.5510.0880.2545.879LTK−1.0 μm0.0220.0100.0450.098a Not available; below detection limit of ICP. Open table in a new tab The cytosolic fraction was further resolved by gel filtration chromatography. The majority of zinc in the cytosolic fraction was associated with a single peak that increased in parallel with [Zn]media (Fig. 5B) and eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 10,000 daltons. This peak coincides with the elution profile of purified cadmium-saturated MT (data not shown). The problems associated with the detection of MT by Western blot analysis have been well documented, and specific modifications have been suggested to improve the performance of these assays (41Suzuki K.T. Aoki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Even employing these changes, we were still unable to detect MT by Western analysis in fractions obtained by gel filtration or from commercially available purified MT (data not shown). However, competitive displacement of MT-bound zinc by Cd(II), which relies upon a rapid exchange of Cd(II) into the protein, has frequently been used to quantify MT (42Jin N. Kimura M. Yokoi K. Itokawa Y. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1993; 36: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the cytosols were incubated with excess cadmium in the presence of thiols followed by gel filtration chromatography. Zinc was completely removed from each of the 10,000 molecular weight fractions and replaced with cadmium (Fig. 5 C). The zinc displaced from MT (data not shown), along with excess cadmium, could be detected in the flow-through fractions (peaks 28–33). These data indicate that the principle zinc-binding species in the 10,000 fraction is metallothionein. It is possible that the LZA-LTK− cell line results from the selection of a subset of cells that grow in conditions of low zinc by increasing MT expression. Alternatively, higher MT mRNA and protein levels may result in most or all LTK− cells as a rapid response to conditions of zinc deprivation. A rapid induction of MT in response to zinc deficiency would suggest that overexpression of MT is a primary response to deal with the s"
https://openalex.org/W1997274335,"A barley endosperm cDNA, encoding a DNA-binding protein of the bZIP class of transcription factors, BLZ2, has been characterized. The Blz2 mRNA expression is restricted to the endosperm, where it precedes that of the hordein genes. BLZ2, expressed in bacteria, binds specifically to the GCN4-like motif (GLM; 5′-GTGAGTCAT-3′) in a 43-base pair oligonucleotide derived from the promoter region of a Hor-2 gene (B1-hordein). This oligonucleotide also includes the prolamin box (PB; 5′-TGTAAAG-3′). Binding by BLZ2 is prevented when the GLM is mutated to 5′-GTGctTCtc-3′ but not when mutations affect the PB. The BLZ2 protein is a potent transcriptional activator in a yeast two-hybrid system where it dimerizes with BLZ1, a barley bZIP protein encoded by the ubiquitously expressed Blz1 gene. Transient expression experiments in co-bombarded developing barley endosperms demonstrate that BLZ2 transactivates transcription from the GLM of the Hor-2 gene promoter and that this activation is also partially dependent on the presence of an intact PB. A drastic decrease in GUS activity is observed in co-bombarded barley endosperms when using as effectors equimolar mixtures of Blz2 and Blz1 in antisense constructs. These results strongly implicate the endosperm-specific BLZ2 protein from barley, either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with BLZ1, as an important transcriptional activator of seed storage protein genes containing the GLM in their promoters.

All the hordeins are structurally related, and their genes presumably derive from a common ancestor by gene duplication and subsequent divergent evolution (1Kreis M. Shewry P.R. Shewry P.R. Barley: Genetics, Molecular Biology and Bio/Technology. CAB International, Wallingford, U.K.1992Google Scholar). The coordinate expression of all hordein genes suggests common regulatory mechanisms of transcription that should involve bothcis-acting motifs in their promoters andtrans-acting transcription factors (2Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Tatham A.S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). A conserved cis-acting motif that is found in most storage protein gene promoters of seeds is the endosperm box (EB; Refs. 3Sørensen M.B. Cameron-Mills V. Brandt A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 195-201Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar and4Bevan M. Colot V. Hammond-Kosack M. Holdworth M. Torres M. Smith C. Grierson C. Beggs K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Salamini F. Wettstein D. Thompson R.D. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 145: 606-613Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These two motifs are present in B- and C-hordein promoters, whereas only the PB is present in that of D-hordeins. Functional analysis of a native C-hordein promoter by particle bombardment of developing barley endosperms (7Müller M. Knudsen S. Plant J. 1993; 6: 343-355Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the GLM is the dominant cis-acting element and that the PB exerts a silencing effect. However, both GLM and PB from the promoter of a Hor-2 gene (B1-hordein) are essential positive elements conferring a high level of transcriptional activity to the minimal 35S CaMV promoter (Δ35S) in bombarded developing endosperms from barley (8Vicente-Carbajosa J. Oñate L. Lara P. Dı́az I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Much of what is known about the genetic and molecular mechanisms regulating cereal seed storage genes comes from work on maize, where a bZIP protein, OPAQUE 2 (O2; Refs. 9Hartings H. Maddaloni M. Lazzaroni N. Di Fonzo N. Motto M. Salamini F. Thompson R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2795-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar and 10Schmidt R.J. Burr F.A. Aukerman M.J. Burr B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), has been shown to bind to and activate transcription from an ACGT core motif adjacent to the PB in the promoter of the 22-kDa class of zein genes (11Lohmer S. Maddaloni M. Motto M. Di Fonzo N. Hartings H. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12Schmidt R.J. Ketudat M. Aukerman M.J. Hoschek G. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In wheat and barley, current knowledge about the transcription factors involved in the regulation of storage protein genes is not as complete as in maize although bZIP proteins, such as SPA from wheat and BLZ1 from barley, have been described in endosperm that are able to interact with the GLM binding site in prolamin genes. Whereas SPA is seed-specific, BLZ1 is also expressed in other tissues and both have been shown to transiently transactivate appropriate reporter genes in planta (8Vicente-Carbajosa J. Oñate L. Lara P. Dı́az I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Albani D. Hammond-Kosack M.C.U. Smith C. Conlan S. Colot V. Holdsworth M. Bevan M.W. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 171-184PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the O2 protein has been shown to interact in vitro with another maize endosperm-specific factor (PBF) of the Dof (DNA-binding with onefinger) class that recognizes the PB motif in the −300 region of the 22-kDa zein promoter (14Vicente-Carbajosa J. Moose S.P. Parsons R.L. Schmidt R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7685-7690Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Its barley orthologue (BPBF) transactivates transcription from the PB element of a nativeHor-2 promoter in co-bombarded barley developing endosperm (15Mena M. Vicente-Carbajosa J. Schmidt R.J. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 16: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the emerging picture of the EB as a refinedcis-regulatory element whereby several nuclear proteins interact, it is crucial the identification of the factors that can participate in this complex and coordinate gene regulation in seeds. BZIP factors are particularly interesting because these proteins bind DNA motifs via dimer formation, either as homo- or heterodimers besides interacting with other regulatory proteins (8Vicente-Carbajosa J. Oñate L. Lara P. Dı́az I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Foster R. Izawa T. Chua N.-H.

More than one bZIP factor can bind to the same target sequence. The final regulatory effect of a particular bZIP factor is exerted through the recognition of a particular cis-motif (G-box, C-box, GLM, etc.) in a promoter and through its interaction with other regulatory factors (bZIPs and other types) expressed in a given cell-type at the same time. We describe here the isolation and characterization of a barley cDNA encoding a novel endosperm-specific bZIP transcriptional activator, BLZ2 (gene Blz2, Barleyleucine zipper 2), that shows a high degree of sequence similarity to SPA from wheat (13Albani D. Hammond-Kosack M.C.U. Smith C. Conlan S. Colot V. Holdsworth M. Bevan M.W. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 171-184PubMed Google Scholar). The BLZ2 protein produced in bacteria binds in vitro to the GLM in the EB of a B-hordein promoter and transiently transactivates transcription from the GLM in the homologous system, the barley developing endosperm. For maximum transcriptional activation, BLZ2 requires also an intact PB in the proximity of the GLM site. In addition, BLZ2 activates transcription in the yeast two hybrid-system, where it can form heterodimers with BLZ1. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) cv.Bomi was germinated in the dark, vernalized at 4 °C for four weeks, and grown in the greenhouse at 18 °C under constant illumination. Developing endosperms (7, 12, 17 and 21 DAP) and 7-day-old leaves and roots were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –70 °C until used for RNA extraction. Developing endosperms for particle bombardment experiments were collected from greenhouse plants and used immediately. A λZAP-II cDNA library from immature barley (cv. Bomi) endosperms (15Mena M. Vicente-Carbajosa J. Schmidt R.J. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 16: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) representing 5 × 106 plaque forming units was plated after infection of the Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue MRF′. The plaques were transferred onto Magna nylon membranes (MSI) by standard procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.108-2.117Google Scholar) and screened using as a probe a 207-bp fragment from the barley Blz1 cDNA clone (GenBankTM/EBI accession number X80068; Ref. 8Vicente-Carbajosa J. Oñate L. Lara P. Dı́az I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) spanning most of its bZIP domain. This DNA fragment was 32P-labeled by the random primed method (Boehringer Mannheim). Prehybridization was at 55 °C for 2 h in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt′s solution, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was done for 16 h at the same conditions. The filters were then washed twice for 15 min at 50 °C in 2× SSC and twice for 30 min at 55 °C in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Using the in vivo excision properties of the Uni-ZAP-XR vector system (Stratagene), the selected clones were excised, according to manufacturer instructions, and recovered in the pBluescript SK plasmid. DNA sequences were obtained using the ABI PRISM 377 dye terminator sequencing system and the ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequence analyzer (Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems). Analyses of DNA and deduced protein sequences were done with the GeneBee-Net Ver.1.0 computer facilities. Total RNA from different barley tissues was isolated essentially as described (21Lagrimini L.M. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Rothstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7542-7546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were probed using the recommended protocols of the manufacturer for Magna nylon membranes (MSI). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C, following standard procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.108-2.117Google Scholar). A 407-bp fragment (nt 1050–1457, shown in Fig. 1) was used as a specific Blz2 probe. The Northern blots were subsequently hybridized with a specific probe for a Hor-2gene (encoding a B1-hordein; Ref. 22Forde B.G. Heyworth A. Pywell J. Kreis M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 7: 1869-1885Google Scholar) and with a barley 18 S rDNA-specific probe (23Azad A.A. Deacon N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4365-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as a control for sample charge. To produce the barley BLZ2 protein in E. coli cells, we used the pT7–7 plasmid (24Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). To obtain a transcriptional fusion of the Blz2full-length coding sequence in the ATG-containing NdeI site of the pT7–7 vector, a 1,230-bp Blz2 cDNA fragment (nt 1–1,230, shown in Fig. 1 B) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following oligonucleotides as primers: (i) LO2FLs (5′-CCGGGAATTCCATATGGAGCCCGTG TTC-3′), a forward primer that incorporates EcoRI (double underlined) and NdeI (single underlined) sites containing the translation initiation codon (bold) of the longest open reading frame of the Blz2 cDNA; and (ii) LO2FLas (5′-TCGGATCCAAGCTTCCTACTGCATCAC-3′), a reverse primer that added BamHI (single underlined) andHindIII (double underlined) sites at the 3′-end of the amplified fragment (stop codon in bold). This PCR fragment was directionally cloned into an NdeI-BamHI digested pT7–7 vector and, after sequencing confirmation, the resulting pT7–7-Blz2 expression plasmid was introduced into theE. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS strain. Induction of BLZ2 expression and preparation of E. coli protein extracts were performed as described previously (8Vicente-Carbajosa J. Oñate L. Lara P. Dı́az I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells carrying the pT7–7 vector with no insert were identically processed as negative controls. The 43-bp probe containing the EB from the Hor-2 promoter (HOR) and two mutated versions of it, respectively affecting the GLM (hor1) or the PB (hor2) described in the corresponding figure, were produced by annealing complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides that generate 5′-protruding ends. These probes were end-labeled with [32P]dATP by the fill-in reaction (Klenowexo-free DNA polymerase; United States Biochemical) and purified from an 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39:1 cross-linking). EMSA experiments were performed essentially as described previously (8Vicente-Carbajosa J. Oñate L. Lara P. Dı́az I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), using 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled probes. The effector plasmids pGBT9 and pGAD424 (CLONTECH), which contain the alcohol dehydrogenase I (AdhI) promoter fused to the Gal4DNA binding domain (Gal4DBD; pGBT9 vector) or to theGal4 DNA activation domain (Gal4AD; pGAD424 vector), respectively, were used to generate translational fusions withBlz2 or Blz1 cDNAs or with selected fragments derived from them. The haploid strain HF7c of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CLONTECH), carryingLacZ (β-galactosidase) and HIS3 (imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase) reporter genes under the control of a truncated Gal1 promoter that containsGal4-responsive elements (Gal1UAS), was used. To investigate if BLZ2 and BLZ1 were able to heterodimerize, the bZIP domain of Blz2 (nt 538–936, corresponding to amino acids 180–312, shown in Fig. 1 B), that was flanked withEcoRI and BamHI sites by a PCR strategy using as forward oligonucleotide LO2BZs (5′-AGAATTCAGCTCTT CCTCATG-3′; EcoRI site underlined) and as reverse primer LO2BZas (5′-GGGATCCACTGAAAT GGGTCC-3′; BamHI site underlined), was subcloned into theEcoRI-BamHI sites of the pGBT9 vector (“bait” construction). The resulting construct was introduced into S. cerevisiae HF7c cells containing the pGAD424 vector carrying each one of the following Blz1 inserts (“prey” constructions): (i) the full-length cDNA (amino acids 1–391); (ii) the cDNA region spanning amino acids 195–391; (iii) the region encoding the bZIP domain (amino acids 195–293); and (iv) that of the leucine zipper alone (amino acids 225–293). To test if BLZ2 were a transcriptional activator in yeast, the full-length Blz2 cDNA (nt 1–1,230, shown in Fig.1 B) was amplified with the LO2FLs and the LO2Flas primers (see above) and inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBT9 (pGBT9-Blz2) plasmid. The 5′-terminal coding region of Blz2 (nt 1–612, shown in Fig. 1 B), was obtained by digestion of the pGBT9-Blz2 withEcoRI and SspI and inserted into theEcoRI and SmaI sites of pGBT9. All constructs were checked by restriction digestion and sequencing. Yeast transformation was performed by the polyethylene glycol method (25Randolph E. BioFeedback. 1992; 13: 18-20Google Scholar) and transformants screened for β-galactosidase production (LacZ) by the colony filter lift assay (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 13.1-13.14Google Scholar) and for growth in a histidine-depleted agar medium (His−, BIO101). The reporter vector was a pUC19-derived plasmid containing the β-glucuronidase reporter gene (27Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (3992) Google Scholar) under the control of a Δ35S promoter and fused to the 3′-terminator of the nopaline synthase gene (3′-nos). In the EcoRI and BamHI sites upstream of this promoter, the following oligonucleotides were fused: (i) HOR, composed of the 43-bp sequence of the endosperm box from theHor-2 promoter (HOR-Δ35S); (ii) hor1, containing the HOR element mutated in the GLM (hor1-Δ35S); and (iii) hor2, containing the HOR element mutated in the PB (hor2-Δ35S). The Δ35S promoter alone was used as a control. The effector constructs corresponding toBlz2 were prepared by cloning its cDNA in the sense or antisense orientation under the control of the 35S CaMV promoter fused to the first intron of the maize AdhI gene and followed by the 3′-nos (35S-I; Ref. 28Vasil V. Brown S.M. Re D. Fromm M.E. Vasil I.K. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 743-746Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar): for the sense construct, theBlz2 cDNA, obtained by PCR with the LO2FLs and the LO2Flas primers, was digested with HindIII and blunted and then EcoRI-digested and cloned into the 35S-I plasmid; for the antisense construct, the PCR-amplified fragment was digested withEcoRI and BamHI and inserted into a 35S-I plasmid restricted with the same enzymes. The sense and antisense constructs for Blz1 were prepared as described previously (8Vicente-Carbajosa J. Oñate L. Lara P. Dı́az I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Particle bombardment was carried out with a biolistic helium gun device (DuPont PSD-1000) according to Kikkert (29Kikkert J.R. Plant Cell Tissue Org. Cult. 1993; 33: 221-226Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Gold particles (1.0 μm in size) were prepared essentially as described by Taylor and Vasil (30Taylor M.G. Vasil I.K. Plant Cell Rep. 1991; 10: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) by mixing 18 μl of gold suspension (60 mg ml−1) with 2 μl (2 μg) of Qiagen-prepared plasmid, 25 μl of 2.5m CaCl2, and 10 μl of 0.1 mspermidine. In all cases, 150 or 250 ng of the reporter plasmids were used and the appropriate concentrations of effector plasmids at the indicated molar ratio. After vortexing for 1 min, the mixture was incubated on ice for at least 2 min, washed twice with ethanol, and finally resuspended in 50 μl of ethanol. For bombardment, rupture disks of 1,100 pounds per square inch (psi) were used and 7 μl of particles, briefly sonicated, were spotted onto macrocarriers. At a distance of 7.5 cm from the macroprojectile stopper, developing barley endosperms (15 DAP) were placed on half-strength MS medium containing 15 g/liter of sucrose and 0.4% phytagel. After bombardment with 154 ng of gold particles, the endosperms were incubated at 25 °C for 24 h according to Jefferson (27Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (3992) Google Scholar). Blue spots were counted under a dissecting microscope, and the GUS activity in each assay was expressed as the mean value of blue spots per endosperm. The histochemical data were directly correlated with the fluorometrically quantified GUS activity per mg of protein with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 (data not shown). The presence in wheat and maize of endosperm-specific bZIP proteins, SPA and O2 (9Hartings H. Maddaloni M. Lazzaroni N. Di Fonzo N. Motto M. Salamini F. Thompson R.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 171-184PubMed Google Scholar), that activate transcription through interaction with the GLM or ACGT core, respectively, of the EB in storage protein gene promoters, led us to search for their barley counterpart. To isolate such a gene, we used the bZIP coding region of the ubiquitously expressed barley Blz1 cDNA (8Vicente-Carbajosa J. Oñate L. Lara P. Dı́az I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) as a probe to screen, at moderate stringency, a λZAPII cDNA library (15Mena M. Vicente-Carbajosa J. Schmidt R.J. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 16: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from early developing endosperm (10–15 DAP). Among ten positive clones purified, after screening 5 × 106 plaque forming units, seven were different fromBlz1, and one of them, hereafter Blz2, containing the longest insert, was selected for further characterization. The restriction map and the DNA sequence of the insert (1,647 nt) in this clone appear in Fig. 1, A andB, respectively. Blz2 is a single copy gene (data not shown) and encodes a bZIP protein (hereafter BLZ2) that contains 409 amino acid residues and a deduced molecular mass of 44,600 Da. Two short open reading frames are found upstream of the ATG start codon. This feature, shared by O2, Blz1, and some other transcription factor genes, may have a role in translation regulation (8Vicente-Carbajosa J. Oñate L. Lara P. Dı́az I. Carbonero P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Lohmer S. Maddaloni M. Motto M. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar). The BLZ2 protein has a typical bZIP domain (Fig. 1 B) with a basic region followed by leucine heptad repeats. A serine-rich motif putatively involved in phosphorylation (32Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), two short stretches rich in acidic residues that could be involved in transcription activation, and a putative nuclear localization signal that spans the complete basic region of the bZIP domain (33Varagona M.G. Schmidt R.J. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1213-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) are also found. The BLZ2 protein is probably the homeologue of wheat SPA (13Albani D. Hammond-Kosack M.C.U. Smith C. Conlan S. Colot V. Holdsworth M. Bevan M.W. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 171-184PubMed Google Scholar) because they share 77.5% identical residues along the whole protein, and 94.8% in their bZIP domains. BLZ2 is also related to the barley BLZ1 protein (34.3% identity over the whole protein; 70.1% in the bZIP domain), to O2 from maize, coix, and sorghum, to REB from rice, and to OHP1 from maize and has limited but significant homology with CPRF2 from parsley and RITA1 from rice (see TableI and references of Fig.2). The phylogenetic dendrogram based on the comparison of the whole proteins and the sequence alignments that appear in Fig. 2, clearly indicate that these proteins form a well defined subfamily of plant bZIPs.Table IComparison between related plant bZIPsTranscription factorsWhole proteinbZIP domainBLZ2 (barley)100100SPA (wheat)77.5 (81.8)94.8 (94.8)CLJO2 (Coix)36.4 (49.4)61.0 (77.9)O2 (maize)31.5 (42.7)59.7 (79.2)SBO2 (sorghum)33.5 (46.3)61.0 (79.2)REB (rice)35.2 (44.5)70.1 (85.7)BLZ1 (barley)34.3 (42.5)70.1 (84.4)OHP1 (maize)31.3 (41.0)67.5 (83.1)CPRF2 (parsley)27.7 (38.0)63.6 (79.2)RITA1 (rice)20.5 (27.4)51.9 (63.6)Percentage of identical (similar) amino acid residues between the BLZ2 protein and other related plant bZIP transcription factors.aCalculations were done using the Clustal W alignment program.a Calculations were done using the Clustal W alignment program. Open table in a new tab Percentage of identical (similar) amino acid residues between the BLZ2 protein and other related plant bZIP transcription factors.aCalculations were done using the Clustal W alignment program. The temporal and spatial pattern of expression of the Blz2 gene was examined by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated from endosperms at different developmental stages, ranging from 7 to 21 DAP, and from young leaves and roots (7 days after germination). After hybridization with a Blz2-specific probe, the mRNA was only detected in the endosperm (Fig. 3). If BLZ2 were a regulator of hordein gene expression, then one would expect the occurrence of Blz2 expression prior to and during the synthesis of the hordein message. To establish this correlation, the same blot was subsequently hybridized with a probe spanning the coding sequence of a Hor-2 gene. The Blz2transcript was already present at 7 DAP, peaking at 12 DAP and decreasing thereafter (Fig. 3). In contrast, the B-hordein transcripts were barely detectable at 7 DAP and were still expressed in late endosperm development (21 DAP). The patterns of Blz2 and hordein message accumulation are therefore consistent with the possibility that Blz2 was an activator of the hordein genes. To investigate the involvement of BLZ2 in the regulation of hordein gene expression, we tested if BLZ2 was capable of binding specifically to the GLM within the EB sequence from the promoter of theHor-2 gene (HOR in Fig.4 A). This DNA fragment was used because it represents a highly conserved sequence in the −300 promoter region of many genes that are exclusively expressed in the endosperm (34Hammond-Kosack M. Holdsworth M.J. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 2: 545-554Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Protein extracts of E. coli, expressing the BLZ2 protein, were incubated with the 32P-labeled HOR sequence, and its ability to bind to this probe was tested by EMSAs. As shown in Fig.4 A, two shifted bands appeared when BLZ2 was incubated with the HOR probe. To further define the motifs within this probe that were recognized by BLZ2, HOR derivatives containing mutations in the GLM (hor1) or in the PB (hor2) were tested in EMSAs. Although the BLZ2 was able to bind to the HOR oligonucleotide, the interaction was abolished when the GLM 5′-GTGAGTCAT-3′ was mutated to 5′-GTGctTCtc-3′, as occurs when using the hor1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 A). However, an intact PB, 5′-CATGTAAAGTG-3′, was not required for the in vitro binding because mutations in this motif, 5′-gAgGTAAAtTt-3′ (hor2), did not affect the retarded complex formation (Fig.4 B). Specificity of all interactions were assessed by competition experiments employing 50, 100, and 200-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide probes. In these experiments, HOR and hor2 were effective competitors, whereas hor1 was unable to compete the BLZ2 binding to HOR or hor2 (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that BLZ2 binds specifically to the GLM sequence within the EB of hordein promoters. The functional relevance of the interaction observed in vitro between BLZ2 and the GLM was further investigated in vivo by assessing the effect of BLZ2 on transient expression assays in co-bombarded barley endosperms. As shown in Fig. 5 A, GUS reporter constructs were generated containing in their promoters EB variants affected either in the GLM or in the PB, respectively. Developing endosperms (∼15 DAP) were transiently transformed by particle bombardment with these reporters alone or in combination with theBlz2 as effector at a 1:0.5 molar ratio. As represented in Fig. 5 B, co-transfection of HOR-Δ35S-GUS and theBlz2 effector resulted in an increase of about 3-fold in the GUS activity compar"

Nature. 1977; 269: 344-346Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and since then threonine phosphorylation has been linked to a number of regulatory cascades that modulate photosynthetic rates (2Allen J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the light harvesting complex has been implicated in the modulation of light energy that is transmitted to the photosynthetic reaction center (3Bennet J. Annu. Rev. Plant Phys. 1991; 42: 281-311Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar), either by separation of the macromolecular complexes (4Allen J.F. Bennet J.F. Steinbeck K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 21-25Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or controlled protein degradation (5Zer H. Ohad I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation is coupled to the association of the reduced plastoquinone and the cytochromeb 6 f complex (6Vener A.V. van Kan P.J. Gal A. Anderson B. Ohad I. J. Biol.

Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 869-885Crossref Google Scholar). The D1 protein of reaction center II is also phosphorylated in a regulated fashion such that its turnover is linked to light quality and intensity via reductants produced from the photosynthetic electron transport chain (7Gal A.

Protein kinase activities that can phosphorylate thylakoid proteins have been described (9Race H.L. Hind G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13006-13010Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Gal A.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 341-344Google Scholar), yet these proteins have not been purified or cloned. We report here on the isolation of a thylakoid protein kinase that is associated with the cytochrome b 6 fcomplex and photosystem II (PS II)1 and that can phosphorylate the LHCP complex.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo identify proteins that interact with the major light harvesting protein (LHCP), we developed a yeast assay that allowed selection of cDNAs encoding activities that bind a known target (12Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5159-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We used as target the LHCP amino terminus, which contains the site of threonine phosphorylation, and we reported on the isolation of anArabidopsis cDNA that encoded a 68-kDa protein kinase, WAK1, that could interact with LHCP in yeast (13Kohorn B.D. Lane S. Smith T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10989-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, WAK1 in plants is responsible for interaction between the plant cell wall and plasma membrane (14He Z.H. Fujiki M. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19789-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and we reasoned that its isolation was due to reduced substrate specificity when expressed in yeast. We expressed the kinase domain of WAK1 in Escherichia coli (14He Z.H. Fujiki M. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19789-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and used this purified protein as denatured antigen in rabbits or renatured antigen in mice. The rabbit serum recognized WAK1 protein inArabidopsis (14He Z.H. Fujiki M. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19789-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), but the mouse serum specifically identified a 55-kDa protein in leaf extracts (Fig.1 A, lane T). Leaves were separated into soluble, microsomal, nuclear, and chloroplast fractions, and the 55-kDa protein was found exclusively in the chloroplast. Further fractionation (11Auchincloss A. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10439-10446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the 55-kDa protein was on the thylakoid membrane (Fig. 1 A, lane Th) and not in the envelope (Fig. 1 A, lane E) or stroma (Fig. 1 A, lane S) of the chloroplast. We tentatively named the 55-kDa protein TAK forthylakoid-associated kinase. TAK can be extracted by NaOH into a low speed supernatant (Fig.1 A, lanes S versus lanes P) but not by NaHCO3 (lanes P versus lanes S), indicating that it is integral or internal to the thylakoid membrane (11Auchincloss A. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10439-10446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TAK is sensitive to proteinase K treatment of intact thylakoid membranes (Fig.1 A, lane PRTK). Because these levels of proteinase K do not disrupt thylakoid membranes (11Auchincloss A. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10439-10446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that TAK is integral to the membrane and has a large portion exposed to the chloroplast stroma. This stromal portion reacts with antiserum raised to the kinase, and so we predict that TAK contains a stromal kinase domain, a necessary location for a LHCP-specific kinase.TAK was first identified by an antiserum to a kinase domain, and we were interested to see whether TAK was indeed a protein kinase. We purified TAK from Arabidopsis leaves by first isolating chloroplasts and then fractionating the thylakoid complexes by sucrose gradient centrifugation (11Auchincloss A. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10439-10446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Keren N. van Kan P.J.M. Berg A. Gong H. Shochat S. Levanon H. Styring S. Anderson B. Ohad I. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. 4. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 299-302Google Scholar). TAK was enriched in a PS II particle containing the cytochrome b 6 f complex (6Vener A.V. van Kan P.J. Gal A. Anderson B. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25225-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The PS II-enriched membrane preparation was incubated with urea and centrifuged, and the dialyzed supernatant was separated on a Sephadex sizing column. The eluted fractions were tested for kinase activity, and a sample containing only a 55-kDa protein band that also reacted with the TAK antiserum was able to phosphorylate BSA in vitro (see “Experimental Procedures”). Silver staining of this active fraction reveals no other proteins in addition to the 55-kDA band.We next determined whether the purified TAK preparation would phosphorylate thylakoid membrane proteins. When thylakoid membranes are incubated in the light with [32P]ATP and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, the 28-kDa LHCP, 31-kDa D1, 43-kDa cp43, and a 9-kDa protein are the most abundant phosphorylated species (Fig. 1 B, lane 6) (16Vener A.V. Ohad I. Anderson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The thylakoid phosphorylation activity can be greatly diminished if thylakoids are first incubated in the dark in the presence of both a PS II (DCMU) and b 6 f electron acceptor (DBMIB), which leads to the oxidization of the PQ pool and thus inhibits kinase activity (as shown in Fig. 1 B, lane 1) (16Vener A.V. Ohad I. Anderson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Purified TAK was incubated with the inhibitor treated thylakoids along with [32P]ATP in the dark, and the reaction was separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. The results are shown in Fig. 1 B(lanes 4 and 5). TAK phosphorylated the 28-kDa LHCP in the presence (lane 5) but not the absence (lane 4) of the reductant DTT. Phosphorylation of other thylakoid proteins is also detected under these conditions, but these levels are significantly lower than the LHCP phosphorylation. This lower level of phosphorylation is also detected using BSA as a substrate (data not shown), indicating that it might represent nonspecific activity. Incubation of the TAK preparation with only [32P]ATP in the presence or absence of DTT did not lead to phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and3), indicating that TAK is not capable of phosphorylating itself under these conditions. Incubation of TAK with stromal proteins also does not lead to phosphorylation (data not shown), and thus we conclude that TAK preferentially phosphorylates LHCP.To obtain cDNAs for TAK we attempted to screen anArabidopsis cDNA expression library with TAK antiserum, but surprisingly we isolated only WAK1 clones. We therefore obtained peptide sequence from the TAK preparation. Four distinct sequences were obtained from a cyanogen bromide-degraded preparation, and these were each used in four separate searches of the Arabidopsis data base. One gene sequence was common to each of the four independent searches, and this was named Tak1. The predicted amino acid sequence of the encoded 55-kDa protein is shown in Fig.2 A where the four peptides are lightly underlined. The amino-terminal 26 residues are predicted to serve as a chloroplast targeting sequence (17Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), followed by a 20-amino acid hydrophobic region that could serve as a transmembrane domain (bold dashed line above sequence). No signal cleavage site is predicted (18Henrik N. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref Scopus (4920) Google Scholar). Amino acids 167–190 may form a distinct ATP binding P-loop (19Saraste M.P. Sibbald R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar), and the remaining sequence includes the 11 conserved domains (amino acids 200–450) characteristic of protein serine/threonine kinases (20Hanks S.K. Quinn A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis for membrane topology predicts that the amino-terminal regions would lie in the thylakoid lumen and the kinase would be stromal (21Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar). A search for related proteins identifies numerous protein kinases, including members of the metazoan TGFβ receptor family, and their identities are shown in Fig. 2 A where identical amino acids are inbold and similar sequences in gray. The sequence shown is ALK5, a subclass of human TGFβ-I receptors, but identities are also found with Caenorhabditis elegans andDrosophila receptors (22Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). These similarities lie both within and outside of the kinase domains, but the reason this receptor class is chosen above the other kinases families is the presence of the SGSGSG box (bold underline) in both TAK1 and the TGFβ-I receptor. This region is the TGFβ-I receptor family signature and acts as the recognition sequence for the partner receptor TGFβ-II, which phosphorylates the TGFβ-I receptor upon ligand binding (23Chen Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavelettich N. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).Figure 2Comparison between TGF βI receptor and TAK1.

Identical amino acids are shown inbold. The relevant TAK1 amino acid is indicated above the alignment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The similarity of TAK1 to the TGFβ receptor suggested that there might be a kinase cascade in the thylakoid. We also predicted that there could be multiple TAK proteins and that TAK1 would be phosphorylated by another TAK. A search of the ArabidopsisDNA data base indeed identifies two additional Taksequences, Tak2 and Tak3, and predictions of both encoded proteins show that they contain the four sequenced peptides. These genes were not identified in the initial search because they both contain introns. The TAKs are 90% identical except TAK3 lacks the carboxyl-terminal 41 amino acids of TAK1 and TAK2 (Fig. 2 B), but the significance of this is unknown. Tak1, but not TAK2 and TAK3, contains the SGSGSG motif (Fig. 2 C), and because the TGFβ-II receptor phosphorylates the TGFβ-I receptor by identifying the SGSGSG box, we draw a parallel between TGFβ-I receptor and TAK1 and the TGFβ-II receptor and TAK2 or TAK3. To explore this similarity we determined whether isolated TAK was indeed phosphorylated and whether the 55-kDa protein band represented multiple TAK proteins. Fig.3 A shows that the 55-kDa Coommassie Blue-stained purified TAK fraction can indeed be resolved into two bands of 55 and 56 kDa upon higher resolution gel electrophoresis (lane Coom), and both proteins react with the TAK serum (Fig. 3 A, TAK). The 56-kDa and to a much lesser degree the 55-kDa TAK react with anti-phosphothreonine and anti-phosphoserine antiserum (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the larger TAK is preferentially phosphorylated on threonine and serine residues. Anti-phosphotyrosine serum does not react with TAK (data not shown). These observations strengthen but do not confirm the parallel between TAKs and the TGFβ receptors, and additional analysis is required to explore these similarities. Although the TAK preparation does not phosphorylate itself (Fig. 1 B), TAK phosphorylation may be context-specific and require theb 6 f complex.Figure 3A, TAKs are phosphorylated in vivo. Purified Arabidopsis TAK protein samples (see text) were subjected to electrophoresis on large 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Coom) or transfer to nitrocellulose. The individual membranes were probed with antiserum against TAK (αTAK), phosphothreonine (αThr) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and phosphoserine (αSer) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) respectively, followed by chemi-illuminiscent detection of the antiserum. B, in vitro import of TAK1 intoArabidopsis thylakoid membranes. In vitrotranslated 35S-labeled TAK1 (lane Trl) was incubated with purified Arabidopsis chloroplasts and then treated with proteinase (lane Chl). The chloroplasts were then separated into a thylakoid (lane Thy) and stromal (lane Str) fraction and subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel, followed by autoradiography. Coom, Coommassie Brilliant Blue stain of TAK purified fromArabidopsis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm that the TAK genes indeed encode thylakoid proteins, we imported an in vitro translated TAK1 into isolated chloroplasts. The TAK1 gene does not contain any introns, and the transcribed region was amplified by PCR, cloned, and expressed in vitro as a 35S-labeled protein (Fig. 3 B,lane Trl) that migrates as a 55.5-kDa protein, between the TAK doublet isolated from tissue (Fig. 3 B, lane Coom). The in vivo phosphorylation of theArabidopsis TAK may alter the protein mobility relative to the in vitro translated protein. Southern analysis indicates that only three Tak genes are present inArabidopsis (data not shown). Thus at present we can not conclude which gene encodes which TAK band. The in vitrosynthesized TAK1 (Fig. 3 B, lane Trl) was incubated with isolated Arabidopsis chloroplasts (11Auchincloss A. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10439-10446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the intact organelles were treated with protease to remove material not imported. TAK1 appears as a protease-resistant 55.5-kDa protein (Fig.3 B, lane Chl) and thus is imported and as predicted is not cleaved by the stromal protease. The 55.5-kDa labeled protein is located in the thylakoid but not stromal fraction (Fig.3 B, lane Thy versus Str). Because TAK1 is imported into the thylakoid and the predicted amino acid sequence contains the four sequenced peptides, we conclude that TAK1 and probably the 90% identical TAK2 and 3 are indeed thylakoid membrane proteins and encode at least one of the proteins identified as TAK in plant tissue.The biochemical analysis of native TAKs, recombinant TAK1, and the predicted amino acid sequence all indicate that TAKs are anchored in the thylakoid membrane such that the protein kinase domain is stromal and can phosphorylate the amino terminus of LHCP. The data are consistent with a membrane topology where the 26 amino-terminal residues lie in the thylakoid lumen, and this raises the possibility that this domain not only serves as an uncleaved signal sequence but also as a sensor of the lumen. It has been demonstrated that kinase activation depends upon the binding of reduced plastoquinone to theb 6 f complex (16Vener A.V. Ohad I. Anderson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and it was predicted that the kinase is intimately associated with theb 6 f complex. TAK indeed co-purifies with both the b 6 f complex and PS II. Although we do observe reductant dependence of TAK activity in vitro, it is neither known how this is effected nor how the transmembrane domain or the lumenal tail may sense the reduced form of the b 6 f complex as models predict. Our experiments assayed the activity of an exogenously added TAK, and the analysis of a kinase activity that is correctly associated with theb 6 f complex and PS II awaits the generation of TAK null alleles. The confirmation of a TAK cascade requires the analysis of recombinant protein and mutant plant analysis, and the similarities with the TGFβ receptor cascade remain suggestive but predictive. TAK antiserum detects a 55/56-kDa protein band in the thylakoids of pea and Chlamydomonas (data not shown), indicating that TAK is of general significance to land plants and algae. Future analysis can now employ these novel organelle kinases to probe the mechanism of redox-controlled phosphorylation of membrane proteins. Protein phosphorylation in the photosynthetic membrane was first observed over 20 years ago (1Bennet J. Nature. 1977; 269: 344-346Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and since then threonine phosphorylation has been linked to a number of regulatory cascades that modulate photosynthetic rates (2Allen J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the light harvesting complex has been implicated in the modulation of light energy that is transmitted to the photosynthetic reaction center (3Bennet J. Annu. Rev. Plant Phys. 1991; 42: 281-311Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar), either by separation of the macromolecular complexes (4Allen J.F. Bennet J.F. Steinbeck K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 21-25Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or controlled protein degradation (5Zer H. Ohad I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation is coupled to the association of the reduced plastoquinone and the cytochromeb 6 f complex (6Vener A.V. van Kan P.J. Gal A. Anderson B. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25225-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and is influenced in different ways by both the quality and the amount of light (7Gal A. Zer H. Ohad I. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 869-885Crossref Google Scholar). The D1 protein of reaction center II is also phosphorylated in a regulated fashion such that its turnover is linked to light quality and intensity via reductants produced from the photosynthetic electron transport chain (7Gal A. Zer H. Ohad I. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 869-885Crossref Google Scholar, 8Keren N. van Kan P.J.M. Berg A. Levanon H. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 579-1584Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus phosphorylation of thylakoid membrane proteins is an important regulative process in land plants and algae. Protein kinase activities that can phosphorylate thylakoid proteins have been described (9Race H.L. Hind G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13006-13010Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Gal A. Zer H. Roobol-Boza M. Fulgozi H. Hermann R.G. Ohad I. Anderson B. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. 3. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 341-344Google Scholar), yet these proteins have not been purified or cloned. We report here on the isolation of a thylakoid protein kinase that is associated with the cytochrome b 6 fcomplex and photosystem II (PS II)1 and that can phosphorylate the LHCP complex. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo identify proteins that interact with the major light harvesting protein (LHCP), we developed a yeast assay that allowed selection of cDNAs encoding activities that bind a known target (12Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5159-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We used as target the LHCP amino terminus, which contains the site of threonine phosphorylation, and we reported on the isolation of anArabidopsis cDNA that encoded a 68-kDa protein kinase, WAK1, that could interact with LHCP in yeast (13Kohorn B.D. Lane S. Smith T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10989-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, WAK1 in plants is responsible for interaction between the plant cell wall and plasma membrane (14He Z.H. Fujiki M. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19789-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and we reasoned that its isolation was due to reduced substrate specificity when expressed in yeast. We expressed the kinase domain of WAK1 in Escherichia coli (14He Z.H. Fujiki M. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19789-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and used this purified protein as denatured antigen in rabbits or renatured antigen in mice. The rabbit serum recognized WAK1 protein inArabidopsis (14He Z.H. Fujiki M. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19789-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), but the mouse serum specifically identified a 55-kDa protein in leaf extracts (Fig.1 A, lane T). Leaves were separated into soluble, microsomal, nuclear, and chloroplast fractions, and the 55-kDa protein was found exclusively in the chloroplast. Further fractionation (11Auchincloss A. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10439-10446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the 55-kDa protein was on the thylakoid membrane (Fig. 1 A, lane Th) and not in the envelope (Fig. 1 A, lane E) or stroma (Fig. 1 A, lane S) of the chloroplast. We tentatively named the 55-kDa protein TAK forthylakoid-associated kinase. TAK can be extracted by NaOH into a low speed supernatant (Fig.1 A, lanes S versus lanes P) but not by NaHCO3 (lanes P versus lanes S), indicating that it is integral or internal to the thylakoid membrane (11Auchincloss A. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10439-10446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TAK is sensitive to proteinase K treatment of intact thylakoid membranes (Fig.1 A, lane PRTK). Because these levels of proteinase K do not disrupt thylakoid membranes (11Auchincloss A. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10439-10446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that TAK is integral to the membrane and has a large portion exposed to the chloroplast stroma. This stromal portion reacts with antiserum raised to the kinase, and so we predict that TAK contains a stromal kinase domain, a necessary location for a LHCP-specific kinase.TAK was first identified by an antiserum to a kinase domain, and we were interested to see whether TAK was indeed a protein kinase. We purified TAK from Arabidopsis leaves by first isolating chloroplasts and then fractionating the thylakoid complexes by sucrose gradient centrifugation (11Auchincloss A. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10439-10446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Keren N. van Kan P.J.M. Berg A. Gong H. Shochat S. Levanon H. Styring S. Anderson B. Ohad I. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. 4. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 299-302Google Scholar). TAK was enriched in a PS II particle containing the cytochrome b 6 f complex (6Vener A.V. van Kan P.J. Gal A. Anderson B. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25225-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The PS II-enriched membrane preparation was incubated with urea and centrifuged, and the dialyzed supernatant was separated on a Sephadex sizing column. The eluted fractions were tested for kinase activity, and a sample containing only a 55-kDa protein band that also reacted with the TAK antiserum was able to phosphorylate BSA in vitro (see “Experimental Procedures”). Silver staining of this active fraction reveals no other proteins in addition to the 55-kDA band.We next determined whether the purified TAK preparation would phosphorylate thylakoid membrane proteins. When thylakoid membranes are incubated in the light with [32P]ATP and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, the 28-kDa LHCP, 31-kDa D1, 43-kDa cp43, and a 9-kDa protein are the most abundant phosphorylated species (Fig. 1 B, lane 6) (16Vener A.V. Ohad I. Anderson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The thylakoid phosphorylation activity can be greatly diminished if thylakoids are first incubated in the dark in the presence of both a PS II (DCMU) and b 6 f electron acceptor (DBMIB), which leads to the oxidization of the PQ pool and thus inhibits kinase activity (as shown in Fig. 1 B, lane 1) (16Vener A.V. Ohad I. Anderson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Purified TAK was incubated with the inhibitor treated thylakoids along with [32P]ATP in the dark, and the reaction was separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. The results are shown in Fig. 1 B(lanes 4 and 5). TAK phosphorylated the 28-kDa LHCP in the presence (lane 5) but not the absence (lane 4) of the reductant DTT. Phosphorylation of other thylakoid proteins is also detected under these conditions, but these levels are significantly lower than the LHCP phosphorylation. This lower level of phosphorylation is also detected using BSA as a substrate (data not shown), indicating that it might represent nonspecific activity. Incubation of the TAK preparation with only [32P]ATP in the presence or absence of DTT did not lead to phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and3), indicating that TAK is not capable of phosphorylating itself under these"

The presence of PKCη in PKD immune complexes was initially detected by in vitro kinase assays which reveal the presence of an 80-kDa phosphorylated band in addition to the 110-kDa band corresponding to autophosphorylated PKD. The association between PKD and PKCη was further verified by Western blot analysis and peptide phosphorylation assays that exploited the distinct substrate specificity between PKCs and PKD. By the same criteria, PKD formed complexes only very weakly with PKCε, and did not bind PKCζ. When PKCη was coexpressed with PKD mutants containing either complete or partial deletions of the PH domain, both PKCη immunoreactivity and PKC activity in PKD immunoprecipitates were sharply reduced. In contrast, deletion of an amino-terminal portion of the molecule, either cysteine-rich region, or the entire cysteine-rich domain did not interfere with the association of PKD with PKCη. Furthermore, a glutathione S-transferase-PKDPH fusion protein bound preferentially to PKCη. These results indicate that the PKD PH domain can discriminate between closely related structures of a single enzyme family, e.g. novel PKCs ε and η, thereby revealing a previously undetected degree of specificity among protein-protein interactions mediated by PH domains.

At least 10 PKC isoforms, i.e. the classic (α, β1, β2, and γ), novel (δ, ε, η, and θ), and atypical PKCs (ζ, λ) have been identified by molecular cloning techniques (5Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar, 7Dekker L.V. Palmer R.H. Parker P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The different PKC isoforms exhibit distinct patterns of expression in different cell types and tissues as well as distinct subcellular distributions, leading to the view that they play distinct, rather than redundant roles in signal transduction (5Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar, 9Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar,10Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). However, since very few of their specific substrates and binding partners have been identified, it has not yet been possible to ascribe to each isoform a unique cellular function. The recently identified protein kinase D (PKD) is a mouse serine protein kinase with distinct structural and enzymological properties (11Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 12Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Trans. 1997; 25: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In particular, the catalytic domain of PKD, which is distantly related to Ca2+-regulated protein kinases (11Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), possesses only a low degree of sequence similarity to the highly conserved regions of the kinase subdomains of the PKC family (14Rozengurt E. Cancer Surveys. 1995; 24: 81-96PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, PKD does not phosphorylate a variety of substrates utilized by PKCs indicating that PKD is a protein kinase with distinct substrate specificity (11Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 12Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of PKD contains a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich regions that bind phorbol esters and diacylglycerol (11Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), similar to those found in classical and novel PKCs (16Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, unlike all PKCs, PKD does not possess a regulatory pseudosubstrate domain upstream of the first cysteine-rich motif. An additional structural feature that distinguishes PKD from the PKC family is the presence of a PH domain, interposed between the second cysteine-rich motif and the catalytic domain. PH domains are modular protein domains which mediate protein-protein and lipid-protein interactions and are found in many cytoskeletal and signal transducing proteins (17Gibson T.J. Hyvönen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Birney E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 18Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The PKD PH domain has been found to contribute to regulation of PKD catalytic activity (15Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recently we reported that exposure of intact cells to biologically active phorbol esters, membrane-permeant diacylglycerol or bryostatin-1 induces PKD activation via a PKC-dependent pathway (19Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,20Matthews S.A. Pettit G.R. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20245-20250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PKD activated within cells via PKC can be immunopurified from cell extracts in an active state that is independent of exogenously added cofactors (19Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Growth factors and mitogenic neuropeptides that promote phospholipid turnover and diacylglycerol generation also stimulate this pathway, indicating that PKD activation is an early event in cell stimulation (21Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23952-23960Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We further substantiated the role of PKCs in PKD activation by coexpression of PKD together with constitutively active mutant PKC isoforms. These studies revealed that novel PKCε and PKCη fully activated PKD within cells, whereas classical PKCβ1 or atypical PKCζ did not (19Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that PKD functions downstream of novel PKCs in a previously undescribed signal transduction pathway. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that coexpression of PKD with PKCη in COS-7 cells leads to the formation of a stable PKD·PKCη complex. Strikingly, we found very little evidence of complex formation between PKD and the PKCε isoform despite its close similarity to PKCη, and no evidence for a stable interaction between PKD and PKCζ. Our results also demonstrate that the PH domain is critical for stable PKD·PKCη complex formation, thus indicating that these domains can mediate highly selective protein-protein interactions. COS-7 cells were maintained by subculture in 10-cm tissue culture plates, every 3–4 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. For experimental dishes, confluent cells were subcultured at a density of 6 × 104 cells/ml in 6- or 10-cm dishes on the day prior to transfections. All transfections and co-transfections were carried out with equivalent amounts of DNA (6 μg/6-cm dish, 12 μg/10-cm dish), using vector pcDNA3 as the control DNA added to single transfections. Transfections were carried out in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 10 μl/6-cm dish or 20 μl/10-cm dish, added to cells in a final volume of 2.5 ml/6-cm dish or 5 ml/10-cm dish, following formation of DNA-Lipofectin complexes according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Cells were allowed to take up complexes in the absence of fetal bovine serum for 5–6 h or overnight, then fetal bovine serum (10% final concentration) in Opti-MEM was added to the dishes to yield a final volume of 5 ml/6-cm dish or 10 ml/10-cm dish. Cells were used for experiments after a further 48–72 h of incubation. The constructs pcDNA3-PKD encoding PKD (12Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the PH domain mutants pcDNA3-PKDΔPH lacking the entire PH domain, pcDNA3-PKDΔ1–4β lacking the first 4 β strands of the 7-stranded β-barrel portion, and pcDNA3-PKDΔα lacking the COOH-terminal α-helix have been described previously (15Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An additional PH domain mutant PKD construct, pcDNA3-PKDΔ1–7β, encoding PKD lacking all seven β-strands of the β-barrel (deletion of amino acids 429–532) was constructed using PCR, as follows: primers carrying the AscI site (forward primer, 5′-GTCAGGCGCGCCGATGTGGCCAGGATGTGGGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTCAGGCGCGCCAGCCAACAGAGGAGCCCTTG-3′) were used to amplify the COOH-terminal part of the PH domain (from Asp533 to Gly557). The generated PCR product wasAscI-digested and reinserted into the AscI site of pcDNA3-PKDΔPH, resulting in the plasmid pcDNA3-PKDΔ1-7β. The cDNAs encoding wild-type and active mutant PKC isoforms were kind gifts from Dr. Peter Parker, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, and have been described previously (23Schèonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence spanning the entire PKD PH domain (aa 418–567) was amplified by PCR from wild-type PKD using specific oligonucleotide primers (forward primer, 5′-GATGGATCCGTGAAGCACACGAAGCGGAGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCAGAAATATCTTTGTGTGAGTTGGA-3′) containing restriction sites for BamHI and EcoRI, respectively (underlined). The resulting PCR product was subcloned as aBamHI-EcoRI fragment into the vector pGEX4T3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to generate the bacterial expression construct pGEX-GST-PKDPH. The 42-kDa GST-PKD PH domain fusion protein (GST-PKDPH) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on glutathione-agarose beads, eluted with 25 mm reduced glutathione, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −20 °C in 40% glycerol. Purity and concentration of the recombinant protein were assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the different PKC isoforms were lysed 72 h after transfection by removal of growth medium from cells on ice and addition of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm AEBSF (Pefabloc), and 1% Triton X-100), and the resulting extracts were combined with either GST (control) or GST-PKDPH fusion proteins preadsorbed onto glutathione-agarose beads. After 2 h at 4 °C, the complexes were washed 8 times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis using isoform-specific antisera to detect associated PKC, as described in figure legends. COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant PKD or co-transfected together with different PKC isoforms were lysed as described above. Small amounts (typically 1/10) of these total lysates were saved and combined with equal volumes of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 0.5m EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) for Western blot analysis. PKD was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 3 h with either the PA-1 antiserum (1:100 dilution) raised against the synthetic peptide EEREMKALSERVSIL that corresponds to the predicted COOH-terminal region of PKD, as described previously (12Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), or a 1:200 dilution of a commercial antiserum (PKD C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), which also recognizes the COOH-terminal region of PKD. PKCs were immunoprecipitated using respective PKC antisera at 1:100 dilution. Immune complexes were recovered using protein A coupled to agarose. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, then twice with kinase buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Autophosphorylation reactions were initiated by combining 20 μl of immune complexes with 10 μl of a phosphorylation mixture containing [γ-32P]ATP (3 μCi/reaction diluted with cold ATP to give a final concentration of 100 μm) in kinase buffer. Reactions were transferred to a water bath at 30 °C for 10 min, then terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold kinase buffer and removed to an ice bucket. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation, and the proteins were extracted for SDS-PAGE analysis by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Dried SDS-PAGE gels were subjected to autoradiography to visualize radiolabeled protein bands. For assays of exogenous substrate phosphorylation, immune complexes were processed as for autophosphorylation reactions, then substrates (either syntide-2 or ε-peptide at final concentrations 2.5 or 1.75 mg/ml, respectively) were added in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi/reaction diluted with cold ATP to give a final concentration of 100 μm) in kinase buffer (final reaction volume, 30 μl), and transferred to a water bath at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 100 μl of 75 mm H3PO4, and 75 μl of the mixed supernatant was spotted to Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Papers were washed thoroughly in 75 mmH3PO4, dried, and radioactivity incorporated into peptides was determined by detection of Cerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter. For Western blot analysis, immune complexes and proteins associated with glutathione-agarose/GST fusion protein complexes were washed as for in vitro kinase reactions, then extracted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples of cell lysates were directly solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), as described previously (21Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23952-23960Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and blocked by overnight incubation with 5% non-fat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with antisera specifically recognizing either PKD or the different PKC isoforms, at a dilution of 1 μg/ml, in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% non-fat dried milk. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and subsequent enhanced chemiluminescence detection or 125I-labeled protein A followed by autoradiography. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham International (United Kingdom). Protein A-agarose and AEBSF (Pefabloc) were from Boehringer Mannheim (UK). Antisera (PKD C-20, PKCζ C-20, PKCε C-15, PKCη C-15, and PKCα C-15) used in Western blot analysis were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Palo Alto, CA. PKC standard proteins were from Calbiochem. Opti-MEM and Lipofectin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Glutathione-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech. Syntide-2 peptide and immunizing peptide EEREMKALSERVSIL corresponding to the PKD COOH terminus were synthesized at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. ε-Peptide was from Alexis Biochemicals. All other reagents were from standard suppliers or as described in the text and were the highest grade commercially available. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-PKD either alone or together with PKCε, PKCη, or PKCζ expression constructs encoding constitutively active PKC mutants were incubated with or without 200 nm PDBu for 10 min and lysed. PKD was immunoprecipitated from the extracts and the resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assays, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography to detect the prominent 110-kDa band corresponding to autophosphorylated PKD. In agreement with previous results (12Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Zugaza J.L.

Furthermore, PKD isolated from cells co-transfected with PKD together with active mutant PKCs ε or η was in persistently activated form in the absence of PDBu treatments of these cells (Fig.1 A). Strikingly, when PKD immunoprecipitates from PKD/PKCη co-transfected cells were assayed, an additional phosphorylated band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of approximately 80 kDa was also apparent in the autoradiograms (Fig. 1 A). This band did not appear when PKD was coexpressed with the active PKC ε or ζ mutant forms despite their level of overexpression shown by Western blot analysis (Fig.2), and despite the fact that the PKCε mutant induced PKD activation to essentially the same degree as did the PKCη mutant (Fig. 1 A). This latter result also indicates that the presence in PKD immunoprecipitates of the phosphoprotein giving rise to the 80-kDa band resulting from coexpression with PKCη is not uniquely required for the persistent activation of PKD. Expression of PKCη on its own followed by immunoprecipitation with the PA-1 antiserum and in vitro kinase assays did not result in the appearance of the 80-kDa band (Fig. 1 A). Thus, the immunoprecipitation and subsequent labeling of the 80-kDa band required PKD.Figure 2Determination of PKD binding specificity toward different PKC isoforms by Western blotting. Exponentially growing COS-7 cells were either transfected with empty vector pcDNA3 (−) or pcDNA3-PKD (A) or co-transfected with vectors containing the cDNAs encoding either wild-type (ε and η; C, D, and G) or constitutively active PKC isoforms (ζ*, ε*, and η*; B, E, and F) together with either pcDNA3-PKD (+) or empty vector pcDNA3 (−), as indicated. At 72 h post-transfection, the cultures were lysed and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with either PA-1 antiserum (A-F) or the PKCη antiserum (G). After washing, the immune complexes were either extracted with gel loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using the isoform-specific polyclonal antisera against either the different PKCs (A-F) or PKD (G, PKD W.Blot) or analyzed by in vitro kinase assays (G, IVK), as indicated. Arrows indicate the position of PKD in anti-PKCη immunoprecipitates (G) and PKCη in PKD immunoprecipitates (D and F). Similar results were obtained in at least three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Initially, we considered whether this band might be the result of either nonspecific immunoprecipitation by the PA-1 antiserum or long-term overexpression of the active mutant PKCη. To test this, we used a commercially available antiserum (rather than PA-1) to perform PKD immunoprecipitations from cells coexpressing PKD together with the wild-type PKCη, followed by in vitro kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 1 B, this assay also led to the isolation of immune complexes containing 110- and 80-kDa phosphoproteins. Thus, it was possible to substitute either the primary antibody used in the immunoprecipitation or the wild-type for the active mutant PKCη and still retain both bands. In addition, both autophosphorylated PKD and the coprecipitated 80-kDa phosphoprotein band were eliminated when the immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out in the presence of the immunizing peptide used to generate the PA-1 antiserum (Fig.1 B). To test whether the 80-kDa band represented a proteolytic fragment of autophosphorylated PKD, we co-transfected an expression construct, pcDNA3-PKD/K618M, which encodes a kinase-deficient mutant of PKD, together with PKCη, and performed immunoprecipitations with the PA-1 antiserum followed by in vitro kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 1 C, this assay again resulted in the appearance of the 80-kDa band. Importantly, whereas the intensity of this band was similar to that seen when the wild-type PKD was used for co-transfection, the intensity of the 110-kDa band was drastically reduced in comparison with that generated by the co-transfection with wild-type PKD 2In results from a large number of experiments, no increases in band intensity associated with in vitrokinase analysis of the kinase-deficient mutant PKD/K618M have been seen. As we do see slight increases in the intensity of this band only when PKCη is coexpressed, we consider likely the possibility that a small degree of transphosphorylation of the mutant by PKCη has occurred in vitro. (Fig.1 C, left). These data also indicate that the kinase activity of PKD is not required for the association with the 80-kDa phosphoprotein. Previous studies indicated that ε-peptide, a peptide based on the pseudosubstrate domain of PKCε, is a substrate for all PKCs (24Herget T. Oehrlein S.A. Pappin D.J. Rozengurt E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but is a poor substrate for PKD (11Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 12Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, anti-PKD immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells transfected with PKD (or the kinase-deficient mutant, PKD/K618M) did not phosphorylate ε-peptide, even when PKD was activated within cells by PDBu treatments (Fig. 1 C, right). Surprisingly, PKD immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells co-transfected with PKD (either wild-type or PKD/K618M) and PKCη (either constitutive active or wild-type) contained activity which strongly phosphorylated ε-peptide. Since this activity was associated with both catalytically active and inactive forms of PKD, and PKD does not phosphorylate the peptide, we conclude that the activity was due to an associated protein kinase (e.g. contributed by the 80-kDa phosphoprotein) whose activity did not require the catalytic activity of PKD. Since PKCη has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 80 kDa in SDS-PAGE, and since the 80-kDa phosphoprotein had appeared only when PKD was coexpressed together with mutant or wild-type PKCη, it seemed plausible that coexpression of PKD and PKCη resulted in the formation of a PKD·PKCη complex that persists during immunoprecipitation of PKD. To test this hypothesis directly, we used Western blot analysis to examine whether PKCη was present in PKD immunoprecipitates. In view of the results indicating that the 80-kDa band is not detected in PKD immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells co-transfected with PKD together with either PKCζ or PKCε (Fig. 1 A), we also performed Western blot analysis to assess whether these isoforms were present in PKD immunoprecipitates. Since PKCα is abundantly expressed in COS-7 cells, we also tested for the presence of this isoform in PKD immunoprecipitates. Lysates of cells either transfected with PKD or co-transfected with PKD and PKCs ε, η, or ζ were either examined directly by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize PKCs α, ζ, ε, or η or subjected to immunoprecipitation reactions with PA-1 antiserum followed by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, D and F, anti-PKCη immunoblotting of PKD immunoprecipitates indicated that both wild-type and mutant PKCη associated with PKD. Similar analysis did not detect the presence of PKCs α, ζ, or ε (either wild-type or constitutively active) in PKD immunoprecipitates from the corresponding cell lysates (Fig. 2, A-C and E). However, longer exposure of the autoradiograms did reveal a faint band of anti-PKCε immunoreactivity (not shown), indicating that PKCε may also associate with PKD but to a much lesser degree. Although the experiments in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that PKCη was present in PKD immunoprecipitates from cells co-transfected with these two proteins, these results were obtained using antibodies directed against PKD. To substantiate further the existence of a PKD-PKCη interaction, we also performed immunoprecipitations using an antibody directed against the opposite partner in the association,i.e. PKCη, followed by Western analysis to detect the interacting PKD protein. As illustrated in Fig. 2 G, in vitro kinase assays revealed the presence of an autophosphorylated band in the position corresponding to PKD (110 kDa) that depended on the presence of co-transfected PKD. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed the presence of immunoreactive PKD when both proteins were co-transfected. Thus, the results shown in Fig. 2 Gdemonstrate the presence of PKD in PKCη immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells co-transfected with"

When combined with other data, in particular from the Robotic Telescope and Transient Source Experiment (ROTSE) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), evidence emerges for a smoothly declining light curve, suggesting some color dependence that could be related to a cooling break passing the ultraviolet-optical band at about 1 day after the high-energy event. The steeper decline rate seen after 1.5 to 2 days may be evidence for a collimated jet pointing toward the observer."
https://openalex.org/W1979173881,"Acrolein is a highly electrophilic alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde to which humans are exposed in various situations. In the present study, the effects of sublethal doses of acrolein on nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells were investigated. Immediately following a 30-min exposure to 45 fmol of acrolein/cell, glutathione (GSH) and DNA synthesis and NF-kappaB binding were reduced by more than 80%. All parameters returned to normal or supranormal levels by 8 h post-treatment. Pretreatment with acrolein completely blocked 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced activation of NF-kappaB. Cells treated for 1 h with 1 mM diethyl maleate (DEM) showed a 34 and 53% decrease in GSH and DNA synthesis, respectively. DEM also reduced NF-kappaB activation by 64% at 2 h post-treatment, with recovery to within 22% of control at 8 h. Both acrolein and DEM decreased NF-kappaB function approximately 50% at 2 h after treatment with TPA, as shown by a secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter assay. GSH returned to control levels by 8 h after DEM treatment, but proliferation remained significantly depressed for 24 h. Interestingly, DEM caused a profound decrease in NF-kappaB binding, even at doses as low as 0.125 mM that had little effect on GSH. Neither acrolein nor DEM had any effect on the levels of phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated inhibitor kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha). Furthermore, acrolein decreased NF-kappaB activation in cells depleted of IkappaB-alpha by TPA stimulation in the presence of cycloheximide, demonstrating that the decrease in NF-kappaB activation was not the result of increased binding by the inhibitory protein. This conclusion was further supported by the finding that acrolein modified NF-kappaB in the cytosol prior to chemical dissociation from IkappaB with detergent. Together, these data support the conclusion that the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by acrolein and DEM is IkappaB-independent. The mechanism appears to be related to direct modification of thiol groups in the NF-kappaB subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2078421611,"Previous studies have shown that a single G protein-coupled receptor can regulate different effector systems by signaling through multiple subtypes of heterotrimeric G proteins. In LD2S fibroblast cells, the dopamine D2S receptor couples to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi/Goproteins to inhibit forskolin- or prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP production and to stimulate calcium mobilization. To analyze the role of distinct Gαi/oprotein subtypes, LD2S cells were stably transfected with a series of PTX-insensitive Gαi/o protein Cys → Ser point mutants and assayed for D2S receptor signaling after PTX treatment. The level of expression of the transfected Gα mutant subunits was similar to the endogenous level of the most abundant Gαi/o proteins (Gαo, Gαi3). D2S receptor-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production was retained only in clones expressing mutant Gαi2. In contrast, the D2S receptor utilized Gαi3 to inhibit PGE1-induced (Gs-coupled) enhancement of cAMP production. Following stable or transient transfection, no single or pair set of mutant Gαi/o subtypes rescued the D2S-mediated calcium response following PTX pretreatment. On the other hand, in LD2S cells stably transfected with GRK-CT, a receptor kinase fragment that specifically antagonizes Gβγ subunit activity, D2S receptor-mediated calcium mobilization was blocked. The observed specificity of Gαi2 and Gαi3 for different states of adenylyl cyclase activation suggests a higher level of specificity for interaction of Gαi subunits with forskolin- versus Gs-activated states of adenylyl cyclase than has been previously appreciated.

The family of Gα subunits is divided into structural and functional homologues, for example, Gαs proteins couple positively to AC to increase intracellular production of cAMP; Gαi/o proteins couple negatively to AC and are inactivated by PTX; and Gαq proteins couple to PLC-β subtypes to increase [Ca2+]i and are insensitive to PTX. The Gβγ subunits of G proteins couple to a variety of cell-specific effectors including AC types II and IV, PLC-β2 and PLC-β3, inwardly rectifying potassium channels, and N-type calcium channels (4Birnbaumer L.

To address the pathways that underlie cell-specific signaling we have studied the G protein specificity of D2S receptor coupling, based on the hypothesis that different G protein subunits mediate receptor coupling to inhibitory versus stimulatory signaling events. PTX acts to uncouple Gαi/o proteins by ADP-ribosylating these subunits at a conserved carboxyl-terminal domain cysteine (Cys) residue (24Yamane H.K. Fung B.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 201-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By mutating the conserved Cys residue in Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαo to a ribosylation-resistant serine (Ser) residue we have generated a series of PTX-insensitive mutants of Gαi/o protein (G-PTX). Because the Cys → Ser mutation is a structurally conservative change, the mutant G proteins remain functional following PTX pretreatment (25Taussig R. Sanchez S. RIfo M. Gilma A.G. Belardeti F.

We have assessed the contribution of individual or specific combinations of G protein subunits to D2S-mediated signaling. The D2S receptor utilizes distinct single Gα subunits to inhibit cAMP accumulation depending on the method of AC activation. In contrast, calcium mobilization induced by the D2S receptor is not reconstituted with single or combinations of Gα subunits, but is blocked by inhibiting Gβγ function. These results indicate a strong dependence on Gαi subtype for D2S-mediated inhibition of AC that is not observed for stimulation of calcium mobilization.

Anti-RGS-His6 was purchased from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, CA). Murine Ltk− cells stably transfected with rat dopamine D2S receptor (LD2S) (13Albert P.R. Neve K.A. Bunzow J.R. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2098-2104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium (MEM) with 10% FBS in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. The cells were routinely passaged using 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in HBBS. For PTX treatment, the cells were treated with 50 ng/ml PTX for 16 h prior to experimentation. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites IITM system (Promega). PTX-insensitive Gαi/o mutants were generated using rat cDNAs (29Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encoding Gαo, Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 subunits. The cysteine 351 codon (352 for Gαi2), i.e. TGT, was mutated to TCT in order to encode serine using the following oligonucleotides: Gαo-PTX, TCCGGGGCTCTGGCTTGTA; Gαi1-PTX, AACCTAAAAGACTCTGGTC; Gαi2-PTX, ACAACCTGAAGGACTCTGGC, and Gαi3-PTX, AAGGAATCTGGGCTTTACT. The mutation was confirmed by endonuclease restriction analysis and Sanger dide- oxynucleotide sequencing. The mutant cDNAs were then subcloned into theEcoRI site of the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The OK-GRK2 cDNA (30Lembo P.M.C. Ghahremani M.H. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 138-147PubMed Google Scholar) was partially digested with BbsI and EcoRI endonuclease and the 1506-bp fragment encoding the COOH-terminal domain starting from Thr493 was isolated and used for the construct (GRK-CT). The His-tag was incorporated using the following complementary oligonucleotides: 5′-CACCATGCGAGGTAGTCACCACCACCACCACCACAC-3′ and 5′-CTTTGTGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGACTACCTCGCATGGTGGTAC-3′. The two oligonucleotides were designed to encode Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His6 with a Kozak sequence (31Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 292-383Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3556) Google Scholar) in the NH2-terminal and cohesive KpnI site at the 5′ end and a BbsI site at the 3′ end. The oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated to GRK-CT fragment using BbsI-cohesive end (His-GRK-CT) and the His-GRK-CT fragment was cloned in pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector in KpnI/EcoRI site. The structure of the His-GRK-CT construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. LD2S cells plated at 50% confluence were co-transfected with 30 μg each of the mutant Gα subunit constructs (Go-PTX, Gi1-PTX, Gi2-PTX, and Gi3-PTX) and 2 μg of pY3 using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and cultured in MEM, 10% FBS containing 400 μg/ml hygromycin-B for 2–3 weeks. Antibiotic-resistant clones of each transfection were picked (24 clones/transfection) and tested for the expression of corresponding Gα proteins using Northern blot analysis. Ltk− cells were plated at 30–40% confluent on 15-cm plates with MEM + 10% FBS. The cells were co-transfected with D2S-pcDNA3 using individual Gα subunit (Go-PTX, Gi1-PTX, Gi2-PTX, and Gi3-PTX) mutant constructs (30 or 60 μg) or the combination of two G proteins (Go/Gi1, Go/Gi2, Go/Gi3, Gi1/Gi2, Gi1/Gi3, and Gi2/Gi3; 30 μg/construct) and pCMV-LacZII (2 μg) using DEAE-dextran (33Morris S.J. Kriz R. Albert P.R. Proceeding of the Society for Neuroscience. 22. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 volume (40 μl) of DNA in TBS was added dropwise to 2 volumes of DEAE-dextran (10 mg/ml) in TBS with agitation. The mixture was added dropwise to plates containing 12 ml of MEM + 1% FBS and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The medium was aspirated and the cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (136 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 0.01 mmNa2HPO4, 1.78 μmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide for 1 min. The plates were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in MEM + 10% FBS. After 36–48 h, the transfected cells were assayed for intracellular free calcium and β-galactosidase activity. A 100-μl portion (10%) of the transfected cells was resuspended in 100 μl of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), incubated for 15 min at room temperature, centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 20 s) and the supernatant recovered. Equal volumes (30 μl each) of cell extract and substrate (0.3 μm4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactoside, 15 mmTris, pH 8.8) were mixed and incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50 μl of Stop solution (300 mm glycine, 15 mm EDTA, pH 11.2). Samples were transferred to 2 ml of Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4) and fluorescence was measured at λEX = 350 nm, λEM = 450 nm in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 spectrofluorometer (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The transfection efficiencies differed by <10%. Cells (107/10-cm plate) were harvested and resuspended in 200 μl of RIPA-L buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium lauryl sulfate, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice. The cell lysate was then passed through a G-25 needle three times to shear genomic DNA and incubated on ice. After 30 min, the lysate was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant recovered and assayed for protein content by the bicinchonic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Lysates (100 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on sodium lauryl sulfate-containing 12% polyacrylamide gels at 100 V, 40 mA for 1 h, blotted on polyvinylpyrrolidone membranes for 1 h at 250 mA at 4 °C. Blots were incubated overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween 20) at 4 °C. The blots were then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody, followed by a 30-min incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature in TBS-T, and the peroxidase product was developed using the ECL for Western blot protocol. Total RNA was extracted from mouse brain tissue and LD2S cells using guanidium acetate and reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc., Burlington, ON) and random hexamer primers (50 ng). The cDNAs were subjected to PCR with the following primer pairs (2 pmol/μl) designed using Primer Select program (DNASTAR Inc.) to amplify specific fragments of different AC subtypes (AC I-VI) with the indicated sizes (bp): ACI (444), 5′-CTGCGGGCGTGCGATGAGGA-GTTC and 5′-GCGCACGGGCAGCAGGGCATAG; ACII (425), 5′-GCTGGCGTCATAGGGGCTCAAAA and 5′-GGCACGCGCAGACACCAAACAGTA; ACIII (418), 5′-GGACGCCCTTCACCCACAACCAA and 5′-AGACCACCGCGCACATCACTACCA; ACIV (454), 5′-CACGGCCGGGATTGCGAGTAGC and 5′-TGCCGAGCCAGGACGAGGAGTGT; ACV (412), 5′-GAGCCCCAATGACCCCAGCCACTA and 5′-CGGGAGCGGCGCAATGATGAACT; ACVI (362), 5′-CCTGGCGGAAGCTGTGTCGGTTAC and 5′-GCGGTCAGTGGCCTTGGGGTTTG. The PCR reaction was performed with different concentrations of cDNA (0.1, 0.5, and 1 μg/reaction) and repeated at least 2 times. The amplified DNA fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced by the Sanger dideoxynucleotide chain termination using modified T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Equivalent numbers of cells were plated in 6-well plates and grown to 70–80% confluence. After rinsing with HBBS buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) the cells were incubated with or without experimental compounds in 1 ml/well of HBBS + 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine at 37 °C. After 20 min the media were recovered and stored at −20 °C. Samples were analyzed by specific radioimmunoassay to detect cAMP (34Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23689-23697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Percent inhibition was calculated using the following formula: % inhibition = 100 − [100(D-C)/(S-C)], where D = cAMP in dopamine-treated cells; C = control or nontreated cells (basal cAMP); S = stimulated cAMP in forskolin- or PGE1-treated cells. Cells were grown to 80% confluence, harvested with trypsin/EDTA, resuspended in 1 ml of HBBS with 2 μm Fura-2 AM and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with shaking (100 rpm). The cells were washed twice with HBBS, resuspended in 2 ml of HBBS, and subjected to fluorometric measurement. The fluorescence ratio of Fura-2 was monitored in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 spectrofluorometer at λEX = 340/380 nm and λEM = 510 nm. Calibration was done using 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm Tris base to determineR max and 10 mm EGTA (pH > 8) to obtain R min (34Liu Y.F. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23689-23697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the fluorescence ratio was converted to [Ca2+]i based on aK d of 227 nm for the Fura 2-calcium complex. Experimental compounds were added directly to cuvette from 100-fold concentrated solutions at the times indicated in the figures. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. The data were analyzed by repeated measure using ANOVA for each set of experiments. The percent inhibition data was analyzed with repeated measure using ANOVA and the data from G-PTX expressing clones were compared with LD2S cell (wild type) using Bonferroni multiple comparison post-test. In order to investigate the importance of individual Gα subtypes in dopamine-mediated responses, PTX-insensitive mutants of Gαi/o were generated and stably transfected into LD2S cells (Ltk− cells stably transfected with the rat D2S receptor cDNA). Transfected clones expressing the highest levels of individual mutant Gαi/o RNA were identified by Northern blot analysis (data not shown) and were named RGo, RGi1, RGi2, and RGi3 for clones expressing Gαo-PTX, Gαi1-PTX, Gαi2-PTX, and Gαi3-PTX, respectively. Cell extracts from clones of interest were subjected to Western blot analysis to assess at the protein level the overexpression of Gα proteins (Fig. 1). Wild-type LD2S cells expressed all four Gαi/o subunits, although Gαo and Gαi3 appeared to be the most abundant based on densitometric analysis. Comparison of Gαo and Gαi3 expression in each transfectant to LD2S (wild type) indicates that transfectant cell lines expressed approximately 2-fold more than the corresponding endogenous Gα subunit. This indicates that approximately equal amounts of mutant and wild-type protein were produced in the transfected cell lines. In LD2S cells, dopamine did not alter the basal cAMP production (21Liu Y.F. Civelli O. Grandy D.K. Albert P.R. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Upon addition of forskolin (10 μm), cAMP levels were increased by 4.5-fold compared with basal (2.22 ± 0.17 versus 0.50 ± 0.04 pmol/ml) (Fig. 2 A). Dopamine (10 μm) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in these cells by 84.5 ± 12.2% (n = 5), an action that was mimicked by apomorphine (1 μm, not shown) and was largely reversed by pretreatment with PTX (Fig.2 A), indicating the involvement of Gi/oproteins. PGE1 has been shown to induce a concentration-dependent increase in cAMP production indicating the presence of endogenous Gs-coupled PGE1 receptors (30Lembo P.M.C. Ghahremani M.H. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 138-147PubMed Google Scholar). In LD2S cells, PGE1 (1 μm) increased cAMP accumulation by 7–8-fold basal cAMP (1.65 ± 0.25 versus 0.196 ± 0.002 pmol/ml) (Fig.2 B). The greater effect of PGE1 may be related to the specific isoforms of adenylyl cyclase present in LD2S cells. Activation of D2S receptors with apomorphine (1 μm) inhibited PGE1-induced cAMP production by 66.3 ± 7.3% (Fig. 2 B) and this action of apomorphine was largely reversed after PTX treatment, implicating Gαi/oproteins. The PTX sensitivity of dopamine-mediated inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production was examined in wild-type LD2S and stable clones expressing the mutant Gα subunits. Dopamine inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in all clones expressing mutant Gαi/o proteins, as observed in LD2S cells (wild type). However, PTX blocked dopamine action in all clones except for those clones which express the mutant Gi2-PTX. In multiple experiments, the percent inhibition by dopamine of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was unaltered by PTX in only RGi2–3 and RGi2–4 clones, whereas in other clones a significant attenuation of dopamine action by PTX was observed (Fig.3). These results indicate that the PTX-insensitive mutant of Gαi2 is functional and that Gαi2 is the only subunit required for D2S-mediated inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production in LD2S cells. The ability of D2S receptor activation to inhibit Gs-coupled stimulation of cAMP accumulation was tested in the LD2S clones expressing PTX-insensitive G proteins. In these clones PGE1 (1 μm) induced a 7–8-fold increase in basal cAMP and apomorphine inhibited PGE1-stimulated cAMP production by 60–70%, comparable to wild-type LD2S cells. Upon pretreatment with PTX, apomorphine-mediated inhibition was completely reversed in RGo, RGi1, and RGi2 clones. In contrast, PTX treatment of the RGi3-2 clone did not block apomorphine-mediated inhibition of the PGE1 response. In multiple experiments, clone RGi3-2 retained significantly higher dopamine inhibitory activity following PTX treatment than any of the other clones (Fig. 4). Thus, the inhibitory action of the D2S receptor on Gs-coupled enhancement of cAMP is mediated through the Gαi3 subunit, rather than the Gαi2 subunit as observed for forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. These results show that the D2S receptor utilizes distinct Gαi subtypes to inhibit forskolin- or Gs-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. To further investigate the role of AC expression in LD2S cells, we performed semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR to determine the relative expression of AC subtypes I-VI, since their regulation has been well characterized compare with other subtypes (VII-X) (21Liu Y.F. Civelli O. Grandy D.K. Albert P.R. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 35Nevo I. Avidorreiss T. Levy R. Bayewitch M. Heldman E. Vogel Z. Mol.

The PCR was performed with different concentrations of cDNA (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 μg/reaction) and repeated at least twice for each concentration. Each PCR reaction amplified a single, specific product with the predicted sized for each AC subtypes, and the sequence was confirmed by sequencing the subcloned fragment. The specificity of the primers used was not altered with change in cDNA concentration, but the intensity of the product increased with concentration (TableI). Mouse brain RNA was used as positive control and was found to express all the subtypes of AC (data not shown). In LD2S cells, RNA for AC I and VI was expressed more abundantly than AC III, AC IV, and AC II (ACI = ACVI > ACIII > ACIV > ACII) and AC V RNA was not detected in these cells (Table I). These results indicate that LD2S cells express AC subtypes at different levels, which may direct the specificity of signaling through AC in these cells.Table IExpression of different adenylyl cyclase subtypes in LD2S cellsAdenylyl cyclasecDNA concentration (μg/reaction)aThe reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed for ACI-VI with 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 μg of cDNA as indicated.

Open table in a new tab In LD2S cells, the D2S receptor couples to PI turnover to induce mobilization of calcium from ionomycin-sensitive intracellular stores (8Albert P.R. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 59-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In LD2S cells dopamine induced a 2–2.5-fold increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.5) which was blocked by the D2 receptor antagonist spiperone and was not observed in D2 receptor-negative Ltk− cells (data not shown), indicating that this effect is mediated by the D2S receptor. The increase in [Ca2+]i induced by dopamine was completely inhibited by PTX pretreatment, suggesting mediation via Gi/o proteins. Each of the clones expressing mutant G proteins responded to dopamine with a 2–2.5-fold increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.6). Following pretreatment with PTX, none of the mutant G protein transfectants exhibited a D2S-mediated calcium response (Fig. 6). In order to test whether more than one G protein could rescue the calcium response, Ltk− cells were transfected with different pairs of the four G-PTX mutant constructs along with D2S receptor and assayed for [Ca2+]i. In all sets dopamine increased [Ca2+]i by 1.6-fold (Fig. 6), similar to that in LD2S cells (33Morris S.J. Kriz R. Albert P.R. Proceeding of the Society for Neuroscience. 22.

Periodontol. 1992; 63: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). At least part of its pathogenic potential appears to be attributable to the production of a variety of proteolytic enzymes that facilitate, directly or indirectly, both local tissue damage and evasion of host defense mechanisms (for review, see Ref. 3Travis J. Pike R. Imamura T. Potempa J. J. Periodontal. Res. 1997; 32: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that this periodontopathogen produces at least seven different enzymes belonging to the cysteine and serine catalytic classes of peptidases, among which three cysteine proteinases (gingipains) are predominant (for review, see Ref. 4Potempa J. Pike R. Travis J. Prospect. Drug Discovery Design. 1995; 2: 445-458Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because their structure, function, enzymatic properties, and pathological significance are known, these endopeptidases are the best characterized group of P. gingivalis enzymes. From in vitro studies it is apparent that two gingipain Rs (HRgpA and RgpB), enzymes specific for cleavage at Arg-Xaa peptide bonds, have a significant potential to contribute to the development and/or maintenance of a pathological inflammatory state in infected periodontal pockets through (i) activation of the kallikrein-kinin cascade (5Hinode D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests participation of these enzymes in the binding of P. gingivalis to extracellular matrix proteins, which may facilitate tissue invasion by this pathogen. In comparison with the gingipains, relatively little is known about other cysteine proteinases produced by P. gingivalis. Two genes, referred to as tpr (12Bourgeau G. Lapointe H. Peloquin P. Mayrand D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3186-3192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and prtT (13Madden T.E. Clark V.L. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 238-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been cloned and sequenced, and although they encode putative papain- and streptopain-like cysteine proteinases, respectively, neither has been purified and characterized at the protein level. However, a gene homologous to prtT has now been identified in the partially sequenced P. gingivalis genome, and the proteinase encoded by this gene, referred to as periodontain, has been purified from culture media and characterized. 2D. Nelson, J. Potempa, T. Kordula, and J. Travis, submitted for publication.2D. Nelson, J. Potempa, T. Kordula, and J. Travis, submitted for publication. Despite the fact that the presence of serine proteinase activity in cultures of P. gingivalis has been known for several years (14Jun K.C. Barua P.K. Zambon J.J. Neiders M.E. J. Endod. 1989; 15: 463-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), only limited information is available about such enzymes. Indeed, a serine endopeptidase has been isolated from culture media, although it was only superficially characterized (15Curtis M.A. Ramakrishnan M. Slaney J.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an enzyme referred to as glycylprolyl peptidase (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) was found to be associated with bacterial surfaces (16Grenier D. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and two molecular mass forms of this peptidase have been described (17Grenier D. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 3131-3136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Barua P.K. Neider M.E. Topolnycky A. Zambon J.J. Birkedal-Hansel H. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2522-2528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme(s) has also been shown to possess the ability to hydrolyze partially degraded type I collagen, releasing the Gly-Pro dipeptide, and it was suggested that, in collaboration with collagenase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV may contribute to the destruction of the periodontal ligament (19Abiko Y. Hayakawa M. Murai S. Takiguchi H. J. Dent. Res. 1985; 64: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition to this potential pathological function, glycylprolyl peptidase may also play a vital role in providing P. gingivalis with dipeptides, which can be transported inside the cell and serve as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy for this asaccharolytic organism. Recently, a gene encoding glycylprolyl peptidase has been cloned and sequenced, and it is now apparent that this enzyme is homologous to dipeptidyl peptidase IV from other organisms (20Kiyama M. Hayakawa M. Shiroza T. Nakamura S. Takeuchi A. Masamoto Y. Abiko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the purification and characterization of another cell surface-associated serine proteinase of P. gingivalis with a novel prolyl tripeptidyl peptidase activity but with a surprising primary structure related to dipeptidyl peptidases. This enzyme liberates tripeptides from the free amino terminus and possesses the absolute requirement for the proline residue in the P1 position. Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP),3 leupeptin, and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin were purchased from Calbiochem. Antipain, iodoacetamide, substance P, bradykinin, and bradykinin-related peptides were obtained from Sigma. Other peptides used in this study were synthesized at the Molecular Genetic Instrumental Facility using an Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protocol with an advanced ChemTech MPS350 automated synthesizer. H-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA, H-Gly-Pro-pNA, Z-Gly-Pro-pNA, Z-Ala-Pro-pNA, and H-Pro-pNA were obtained from Bachem. Prolinal was kindly provided by Dr. James Powers (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA), and cystatin C was provided by Dr. Magnus Abrahamson (University of Lund, Lund, Sweden). P. gingivalisHG66 was a gift of Dr. Roland Arnold (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), and the strains W50 and ATCC 33277 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were grown as described previously (21Chen Z. Potempa J. Polanowski A. Wikstrom M. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18896-18901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Routinely, the tripeptidyl peptidase amidolytic activity was measured with H-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA (1 mm) in 0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.5, at 37 °C. The assay was performed in a total volume of 0.2 ml on microplates, and the initial turnover rate was recorded at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Spectramax, Molecular Devices). In inhibition studies, the enzyme was first preincubated with inhibitor for 15 min at 37 °C, substrate was added, and residual activity was recorded. H-Gly-Pro-pNA, Z-Ala-Pro-pNA, Z-Gly-Pro-pNA, and H-Pro-pNA (1 mm final concentration) were assayed in the same manner. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA reagent kit (Sigma), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cultures ofP. gingivalis HG66, W50, and ATCC 33277, at different phases of growth, were subjected to the following fractionation procedure. The cells were removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min), washed twice with 10 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.4, resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and disintegrated by ultrasonication in an ice bath at 1500 Hz for 5 cycles (5 min of sonication and 5 min of brake). Unbroken cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min), and the opalescent supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation (150,000 × g, 120 min), yielding a pellet containing bacterial membranes and a supernatant that was considered membrane-free cell extract. All fractions, as well as the full culture, culture medium, and full culture after sonication, were assayed for amidolytic activity against H-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C except for FPLC separations, which were carried out at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 ×g, 30 min), washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and resuspended in the same buffer (150 ml/50 g of cells, wet weight). Triton X-100 (10% v/v in H2O) was added slowly to the bacterial cell suspension to a final concentration of 0.05%. After 120 min of gentle stirring, unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (28,000 × g, 60 min). Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with cold acetone (−20 °C) added to a final concentration of 60%, collected by centrifugation, redissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and extensively dialyzed against 20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.02% sodium azide. The dialyzed fraction was clarified by centrifugation (28,000 ×g, 30 min) and applied to a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 20 ml/h, after which the column was washed until theA 280 fell to zero. Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient from 20 to 300 mm potassium phosphate, and fractions (7 ml) were analyzed for dipeptidyl- and tripeptidyl peptidase activity using H-Gly-Pro-pNA and H-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA, respectively. The activity against the latter substrate was pooled, saturated with 1 m ammonium sulfate, clarified by centrifugation, and directly loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose HP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with two volumes of equilibration buffer, followed by buffer containing 0.5 m ammonium sulfate, and developed with a descending gradient of ammonium sulfate from 0.5 to 0 m. Active fractions were pooled, extensively dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 FPLC column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 5 volumes of equilibration buffer at 1.0 ml/min, after which bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 25 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.3, and subjected to chromatofocusing on a MonoP FPLC column equilibrated with Bis-Tris buffer, using a pH gradient developed with 50 ml of 10 × diluted Polybuffer 74 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) adjusted to a pH of 4.0. The SDS-PAGE system of Schagger and von Jagow (22Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar) was used to monitor enzyme purification and estimate the enzyme molecular mass. For amino-terminal sequence analysis, proteins resolved in SDS-PAGE were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using 10 mm3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid, pH 11, 10% methanol (23Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was washed thoroughly with water and stained with Coomassie Blue G250. The blot was air dried, and protein bands were cut out and subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis with an Applied Biosystems 491 protein sequencer using the program designed by the manufacturers. The purified prolyl tripeptidyl peptidase (PTP-A) was partially denatured by incubation in 6m urea in 0.02 m Tris, pH 7.6, for 60 min. Low molecular mass gingipain R (RgpB) from P. gingivalis was then added to make an enzyme:substrate molar ratio of 1:100; the reaction mixture was made in 1 mm cysteine; and the sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Generated peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC using a μBondapak C-18 column (3.9 × 300 mm; Waters, Milford, MA). Peptides were eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid, using a gradient from 0 to 80% acetonitrile over 60 min. Peptides were monitored at 220 nm and collected manually. For determination of the active site serine residue and to confirm that the purified enzyme was, indeed, a serine proteinase, 100 μg of purified PTP-A was first incubated with 170 μCi of [1,3-3H]DFP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 25 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The reaction was quenched by addition of cold DFP to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the radiolabeled material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiographic analysis. The gel was dehydrated, soaked in 2,5-diphenyloxazole solution for 2 h, and dried, and the DFP-binding proteins were detected by fluorography after an exposure time of 96 h on x-ray film (XAR; Eastman Kodak). The bulk of radiolabeled protein was subjected to proteolytic fragmentation with RgpB, and peptides obtained were separated by reverse phase HPLC as described above. Radioactivity in each peptide fraction was measured using a β liquid scintillation counter, and the labeled peptide as well as other selected peptides were subjected to sequence analysis. The data base containing the unfinished P. gingivalis W83 genome, available from The Institute for Genomic Research, was searched for the presence of nucleotide sequences corresponding to the amino-terminal and the internal PTP-A amino acid sequences using the TBALSTN algorithm (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Moller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59753) Google Scholar). An identified clone, gnl‖TIGR‖P. gingivalis_126, was retrieved from The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) data base. The position of the PTP-A gene was localized using the National Center for Biotechnology Information open reading frame (ORF) finder, and the amino acid sequence, obtained by conceptual translation of the entire ORF, was further used for homology screening by use of the NCBI BLAST search tool. Peptides were incubated with 1 μg of PTP-A at an enzyme:substrate molar ratio of 1:100 for 3 or 24 h in 50 μl of 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid. The samples were then subjected to reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a μBondapak C-18 column (3.9 × 300 mm) (Waters, Milford, MA) and an acetonitrile gradient (0–80% in 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid in 50 min). Each peak, detected at 220 nm, was collected, lyophilized, redissolved in 50% (v/v) methanol, 0.1% acetic acid, and subjected to analysis by mass spectrometry. A Finnigan MAT 95S sector mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an electrospray source (ESI) was operated essentially as described previously (25Stenfors C. Hellman U. Silberring J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5747-5751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Peptides were identified by fitting of the obtained spectra to specific sequences using an Internet application program MsFit available at http://falcon.ludwig.ucl.ac.uk/msfit.html. Analysis of amidolytic activity against H-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA in several fractions of P. gingivalis, HG66, W50, and ATCC 33277, clearly indicated that an enzyme(s) with prolyl tripeptidyl peptidase activity is localized on the cell surface in all strains tested, with <5% of the total activity being found in the medium regardless of the growth phase of the bacterial culture. Cell-associated enzyme was easily detached from the bacterial surface by treatment with a low concentration (0.05%) of Triton X-100. This procedure released >85–90% of activity in a soluble form. Subsequent acetone precipitation of proteins in the Triton X-100 fraction successfully separated the activity from pigment that remained in solution. The redissolved protein fraction, after dialysis, was applied to hydroxyapatite chromatography, and at this step substantial separation of the PTP-A activity from both the dipeptidyl peptidase IV and bulk protein was achieved (Fig.1 A). Further purification performed by subsequent chromatography steps, including phenyl-Sepharose (Fig. 1 B), MonoQ (Fig. 1 C), and MonoP columns (Fig. 1 D), resulted in the isolation of purified enzyme. Significantly, the chromatography step on MonoP yielded an A 280 profile much sharper than the activity peak. Although this imperfect overlap of protein and activity profiles may suggest that the protein component does not represent active enzyme, the rest of data argue with such a contention. This apparent contradiction may be likely explained by the enzyme inhibition by the reaction product of H-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA hydrolysis, but this possibility has not been been explored. The yield of protein and activity recovery in a typical purification procedure is summarized in Table I.Table IPurification of the PTP-A from P. gingivalisStepVolumeProteinTotal activityaBased on the enzymatic activity using H-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA, where 1 unit = mOD/min/1 μl.Specific activityPurification foldYieldmlmgunits/mg%Triton X-100 extract after centrifugation2001200757,6736421100Acetone precipitate50600537,6228961.471Hydroxyapatite chromatography5022400,03918,1832853Phenyl-Sepharose4810312,50531,2504841MonoQ31.5244,828163,21825432MonoP40.7188,400269,14242025a Based on the enzymatic activity using H-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA, where 1 unit = mOD/min/1 μl. Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme revealed the presence of two protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 81.8 and 75.8 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2, lane f). Autoradiography of the enzyme sample radiolabeled with [1,3-3H]DFP (Fig. 2, lane g) clearly indicated that the bands represented either two distinct serine proteinases or different molecular mass forms of the same enzyme. In an attempt to distinguish between these two options, the electrophoretically resolved proteins were subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis, but, unfortunately, it was found that the 81.8-kDa form of PTP-A had a blocked amino terminus. In contrast, the sequence NH2-SAQTTRFSAADLNALMP- was found at the amino terminus of the lower molecular mass form of the enzyme. This result led us to the possibility that the 75.8-kDa form of PTP-A was derived from the 81.8-kDa form through proteolytic cleavage of a 6-kDa amino-terminal peptide. To confirm this hypothesis and, in addition, to localize the active site residue within P. gingivalis PTP-A, the mixture containing both radiolabeled enzymes was proteolytically fragmented, and peptides were resolved by reverse phase HPLC. This procedure yielded only one major radioactive peptide peak (data not shown), and the purified peptide was found to have a single amino acid sequence: IGVHGWXYGGFMTTNL, where X apparently represents the DFP-modified serine residue. These data convincingly indicate that the two protein bands of purified PTP-A represents different forms of the same enzyme. Using the amidolytic activity assay with H-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA, it was found that the enzyme has a broad pH optimum from pH 6.0 to 8.0, and in 0.2m HEPES, pH 7.6 was stable for at least 12 h at 25 or 37 °C. PTP-A activity was not affected by class-specific synthetic inhibitors of cysteine or metalloproteinases (TableII). In contrast, preincubation of the enzyme with DFP or Pefablock resulted in total loss of activity, supporting its classification as a serine proteinase. Surprisingly, however, 3,4-dichloroisocumarin was only a poor inhibitor, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, antipain, and prolinal had no effect at all. Interestingly, preincubation of PTP-A with iodoacetamide, but not with N-ethylmaleimide, stimulated enzyme amidolytic activity ∼2-fold. Human plasma inhibitors, such as α1-proteinase inhibitor, α1-antichymotrypsin, and α2-macroglobulin, did not affect the enzyme activity, nor were they cleaved by PTP-A (data not shown).Table IIEffect of inhibitors on the amidolytic activity of PTP-AInhibitorConcentrationResidual activity%Diisopropyl fluorophospate10 mm0Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride10 mm96Pefabloc SC1 mg/ml2010 mg/ml03,4-Dichloroisocoumarin1 mm56Iodoacetamide5 mm200N-Ethylmaleimide5 mm1001,10-Orthophenanthroline1 mm98EDTA5 mm93Leupeptin0.1 mm100Antipain0.1 mm100Prolinal0.1 mm100Results are for a 15-min incubation at 37 °C in 0.2 mm HEPES pH 7.6, with 1 mmH-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA as substrate. Open table in a new tab Results are for a 15-min incubation at 37 °C in 0.2 mm HEPES pH 7.6, with 1 mmH-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA as substrate. Among several chromogenic substrates tested, including H-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA, H-Gly-Pro-pNA, Z-Gly-Pro-pNA, Z-Ala-Pro-pNA, and H-Pro-pNA, only H-Ala-Phe-Pro-pNA was hydrolyzed by PTP-A, indicating a prolyl-specific tripeptidyl peptidase activity. To further confirm this specificity, several synthetic peptides composed of 5–34 amino acid residues and containing at least 1 proline residue were tested as substrates for PTP-A. Of 22 peptides tested only those with a proline residue in the third position from the amino-terminal end were cleaved (Table III), with the significant exception of peptides with adjacent proline residues (peptides 3, 4, and 16). In addition, a free α-amino group was absolutely required for cleavage after the third proline residue, as exemplified by resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis of peptide 9, which differs from peptide 8 only in acylation of the α-amino group of the amino-terminal valine residue. Except for these two limitations, the peptide bond -Pro-↓-Yaa- was cleaved at the same rate in all peptides with the general formula NH2-Xaa-Xaa-Pro-Yaa-(Xaa)n, where Xaa represents any amino acid residue, whereas Yaa could be any residue except proline, regardless of the chemical nature of the amino acids and the length of the peptide. In all cases the reaction was completed within 3 h, and prolonged incubation for 24 h did not affect the pattern of cleavage, confirming the absolute requirement for a proline residue at the third position from the unblocked amino terminus. In addition, these data indicate that the preparation of PTP-A was free of any contamination with aminopeptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase, or endopeptidase activities.Table IIICleavage specificity of tripeptidyl peptidase on synthetic peptidesSubstrateCleavage sitePeptide 1H-Arg-Pro-Pro-↓a↓, cleavage site.-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-ArgPeptide 2H-Arg-Pro-Pro-↓-Gly-PhePeptide 3H-Lys-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-ArgPeptide 4H-Tyr-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-ArgPeptide 5H-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-ArgPeptide 6H-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2Peptide 7H-Val-Pro-Pro-↓-Gly-Glu-Asp-Ser-Lys-Glu-Val-Ala-Ala-Pro-His-Arg-GlnPeptide 8H-Val-Pro-Pro-↓-Gly-Glu-Asp-Ser-LysPeptide 9Ac-Val-Pro-Pro-Gly-Glu-Asp-Ser-LysPeptide 10H-Val-Glu-Pro-↓-Ile-Pro-TyrPeptide 11H-Arg-Gly-Pro-↓-Phe-Pro-IlePeptide 12H-Ala-Arg-Pro-↓-Ala-D-Lys-amidePeptide 13H-Pro-Asn-Pro-↓-Asn-Gln-Gly-Asn-Phe-IlePeptide 14H-Arg-His-Pro-↓-Lys-Tyr-Lys-Thr-Glu-LeuPeptide 15H-Gly-Val-Pro-↓-Lys-Thr-His-Leu-Glu-LeuPeptide 16H-Lys-Gly-Pro-Pro-Ala-Ala-Leu-Thr-LeuPeptide 17H-Gln-Lys-Gln-Met-Ser-Asp-Arg-Arg-Glu-Asn-Asp-Met-Ser-Pro-Ser-Asn-Asn–Val-Val-Pro-Ile-His-Val-Pro-Pro-Thr-Thr-Glu-Asn-Lys-Pro-Lys-Val-GlnPeptide 18H-Phe-Leu-Arg-Glu-Pro-Val-Ile-Phe-LeuPeptide 19H-Gly-Ile-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Glu-Ile-Leu-AlaPeptide 20H-Leu-Pro-Asp-Leu-Asp-Ser-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Ile-Gln-Glu-Leu-Leu-Ser-Pro–Gln-Glu-Pro–Pro-Arg-Pro-Pro-Glu-AlaPeptide 21H-Cys-Leu-Ser-Ser-Gly-Thr-Leu-Pro-Gly-Pro-Gly-Asn-Asp-Ala-Ser-Arg-Glu–Leu-Glu-SerPeptide 22H-Lys-Ile-Ala-Gly-Tyr-His-Leu-Glu-Leua ↓, cleavage site. Open table in a new tab The lack of cleavage after internal proline residues in the synthetic peptides corresponds well with the absence of any proteolytic activity on several protein substrates, including IgA, IgG, albumin, azocasein, carboxymethylated ribonuclease, and gelatin. However, the size of the substrate, which is a limiting factor in the activity of oligopeptidases (26Walter R. Simmons W.H. Yoshimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 30: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), is not restricting in the case of PTP-A, because the enzyme is able to cleave a tripeptide (NH2-Xaa-Xaa-Pro) from the amino terminus of both human cystatin C and interleukin 6 (data not shown). Partial PTP-A amino acid sequence data allowed us to identify the P. gingivalis genomic clone gnl‖TIGR‖P. gingivalis_126 in the Unfinished Microbial Genomes data base, TIGR. An ORF corresponding to the PTP-A amino acid sequence was found, as indicated by the fact that all sequences of the PTP-A-derived peptides obtained by the enzyme polypeptide fragmentation with RgpB were present in the protein primary structure inferred from the nucleotide sequence of the ORF. The 732-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated mass of 82,266 Da was encoded in this ORF. The homology search performed using the NCBI TBLASTN tool against GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ, and PDB data bases, and subsequent multiple sequence alignments (Fig. 3) indicated that PTP-A is a new member of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteinases (27Rawlings N.D. Polgar L. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 907-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Within this large and diverse family of evolutionary and functionally related enzymes both from prokaryotes and eukaryotes, PTP-A was most closely related to bacterial dipeptidyl peptidase IV fromFlavobacterium meningosepticum, Xantomonas maltophilus, and P. gingivalis, sharing 31.6, 30.4, and 28.5% amino acid sequence identity, respectively. Remarkably, the carboxyl-terminal region of the PTP-A molecule (residues 502–732) shows a significant similarity to the eukaryotic prolyl oligopeptidases, with 34 and 33% identity to human dipeptidyl peptidase IV and mouse fibroblast activation protein (FAP), respectively (Fig. 3). This part of the molecule contains the amino acid residues that encompass the catalytic triad in all characterized prolyl oligopeptidases, and from the multiple alignments with dipeptidyl peptidase IV of confirmed active site residues (28Kabashima T. Yoshida T. Ito K. Yoshimoto T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) it is apparent that Ser-603, Asp-768, and His-710 represent the catalytic triad of PTP-A (Fig. 3). Such an inference is further supported by the direct labeling of Ser-603 by DFP. In addition, the computer-assisted search for sequential motifs characteristic for transmembrane domains revealed the presence of such a putative region within the amino-terminal sequences of PTP-A, with residues 5–25 most likely folded into a hydrophobic α-helix responsible for membrane anchoring of this enzyme. Because of their cyclic aliphatic character, proline residues bestow unique conformational constraints on polypeptide chain structure, significantly affecting the susceptibility of proximal peptide bonds to proteolytic cleavage (29Yaron A. Naider F. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). It is assumed, therefore, that those proline residues that often appear near the amino termini of many biologically active peptides protect them against proteolytic degradation by proteinases with general specificity. For the cleavage of peptide bonds adjacent to proline residues a specialized group of proteolytic enzymes has evolved, and their activity in vivomay have important physiological significance, because it may lead to inactivation of many biologically active peptides and/or transformation of the activity of others (30Cunningham D.F. O'Connor B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 160-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In addition, hydrolysis of prolyl-X bonds in conjunction with general catabolic pathways should allow the complete reutilization of amino acids by living organisms, including bacteria. However, prolyl peptidases from bacterial pathogens, if released into the host environment, may interfere with the physiological functions of biologically active peptides and proteins and, therefore, contribute to the pathogenecity of infectious disease. In this report we have described the purification, properties, and amino acid sequence of a novel prolyl-specific tripeptidyl peptidase from P. gingivalis. PTP-A releases tripeptides from small proteins such as interleukin 6 and cystatin C as well as from peptides. It works as an exopeptidase because those peptides with a blocked α-amino group are not processed. In addition, the enzyme has an absolute requirement for Pro in the P1 position because the substitution of proline by any other amino acid, including hydroxyproline, is not tolerated. PTP-A was classified as a serine protease based on its inhibition by DFP and its resistance to sulfydryl blocking and chelating agents, and this was also confirmed by sequencing of the peptide containing the DFP-labeled active site residue. The sequence GWSYGG is the signature for a recently identified group of serine proteinases, the prolyl oligopeptidase (S9) family, and indeed, sequence alignment clearly indicates that PTP-A is a new member of this family, most closely related to bacterial and eukaryotic dipeptidyl peptidases IV. In parallel with other members of the S9 family, P. gingivalisPTP-A contains the typical prolyl oligopeptidase catalytic triad topology of Ser-603-Asp-678-His-711 located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the amino acid sequence in a region now designated the protease domain. Despite structural similarities to proteinases from the prolyl oligopeptidase family, the tripeptidyl peptidase activity of PTP-A is unusual for this group of enzymes, and no other known similar activity has so far been attributed to any other member of the S9 family. In fact, all strict tripeptidyl peptidases belong only to the subtilisin family (S8) and the S33 family of serine proteinases; however, they neither share a structural relationship with PTP-A nor have activity limited to cleavage after proline residues (31Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998Google Scholar). In this respect, theP. gingivalis tripeptidyl peptidase is a unique enzyme, and it will be interesting to learn the structural basis for its narrow specificity. In P. gingivalis PTP-A, as well as in dipeptidyl peptidase IV (19Abiko Y. Hayakawa M. Murai S. Takiguchi H. J. Dent. Res. 1985; 64: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), all activities are cell surface associated, and it is conceivable that the enzymes are membrane anchored through putative signal sequences, which are not cleaved but remain as a membrane-spanning domain similar to other members of the prolyl oligopeptidase family (32Hong W.J. Doyle D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, a significant portion of the purified PTP-A has a truncated amino terminus, apparently attributable to cleavage by Lys-specific proteinase and likely to be an artifact that has occurred during the purification procedure. Nevertheless, the proteolytic shedding of membrane-bound PTP-A and dipeptidyl peptidase IV also occurs during cultivation of the bacteria, as indicated by variable amount of soluble activities found in cell-free culture media. The cell surface localization of dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl peptidases also supports a putative physiological function in providing nutrients for growing bacterial cells. Here, the inability of asaccharolyticP. gingivalis to utilize free amino acids (34Dashper S.G. Kandasamy S. O'Brien-Simpson N. Reynolds E.C. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77 (abstr.): 1133Google Scholar) makes the bacterium entirely dependent on an external peptide supply. In this regard, dipeptidyl peptidase IV and PTP-A activities are probably very important, if not indispensable, for bacterial growth. This suggestion is strongly corroborated by the fact that the P. gingivalisgenome contains three additional genes encoding proteinases homologous with dipeptidyl peptidase IV and PTP-A and one related to aminopeptidase B. If expressed, each gene product would probably have enzymatic activity, because each has a well preserved catalytic triad (Fig. 4). In addition, all of these genes encode a putative signal peptide, which may act in providing membrane anchorage motifs. Whether each of these enzymes is constitutively expressed or forms a backup system to provide nutrients in a specific environment is presently unknown, but our preliminary data indicate that at least one aminopeptidase B homologue, also having tripeptidyl peptidase activity, is produced during P. gingivalis growth. 4A. Banbula, M. Bugno, J. Travis, and J. Potempa, unpublished results. Although there is a little doubt that P. gingivalishomologues of prolyl peptidases can be considered important housekeeping enzymes, their external localization and uncontrolled activity may contribute significantly to runaway inflammation in the human host and the pathological degradation of connective tissue during periodontitis. Working in concert, the bacterial PTP-A and dipeptidyl peptidase IV have the ability to completely degrade collagen fragments locally generated be endogenous or bacterial collagenases. Because type I collagen is the major component of periodontal ligament, its enhanced degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV and PTP-A, as well as by functionally related enzymes released by other periodontopathogens (33Gazi M.I. Cox S.W. Clark D.T. Eley B.M. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 12: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), may contribute to tooth attachment loss and periodontal pocket formation; thus these enzymes must be considered important pathogenic factors of these bacteria.

YJR019C directed green fluorescence protein to peroxisomes, and biochemical studies revealed that YJR019C is an abundant component of purified yeast peroxisomes.

We report here that hTE is also a peroxisomal protein, demonstrating that thioesterase activity is a conserved feature of peroxisomes. We propose that YJR019Cand hTE be renamed as yeast and human PTE1 to reflect the fact that they encode peroxisomal thioesterases. The physical segregation of yeast and human PTE1 from the cytosolic fatty acid synthase suggests that these enzymes are unlikely to play a role in formation of fatty acids.

This enzymatic activity is an intrinsic component of animal fatty acid synthetase and in this context serves to terminate chain elongation (1Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Additional thioesterases may associate noncovalently with fatty acid synthetase to modify the length of fatty acids produced by fatty acid synthetase in certain tissues. For instance, a mammary gland-specific thioesterase has been shown to direct the production of medium chain fatty acids during lactation (2Libertini L.J. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1393-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these fatty acid synthetase-associated thioesterases perform a relatively well understood role in cellular metabolism, eukaryotic cells contain a number of additional thioesterase activities with less well defined functions. The most notable of these are the intraorganellar thioesterases of peroxisomes and mitochondria. Both peroxisomal and mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterases have been reported in mammalian cells (3Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12177-12183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Svensson L.T. Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J.

Peroxisomes and mitochondria do not contain fatty acid synthetase, and their thioesterases would not be expected to participate in the synthesis of fatty acids. In fact, the mere presence of thioesterases in these organelles seems counterproductive, because the oxidation of acyl-CoAs is a main function of both peroxisomes and mitochondria. Although the molecular cloning of mitochondrial fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase has been reported recently (5Svensson L.T. Engberg S.T. Toshifumi A. Usada N. Alexson S.E.H. Hashimoto T. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the structural genes for peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterases remain to be identified. Here we report thatYJR019C is a novel fatty acid-induced gene of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. This gene encodes a peroxisomal protein, and both genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrate that theYJR019C product is an acyl-CoA thioesterase. Loss ofYJR019C interferes with the ability of yeast to grow on fatty acids, suggesting that this thioesterase plays an ancillary role in fatty acid oxidation rather than fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, we report that this gene is conserved in humans and that the human form of this gene also encodes a peroxisomal thioesterase. The implications of these results for the role of peroxisomal thioesterases are discussed. The YJR019C open reading frame (ORF)1 was amplified fromS. cerevisiae genomic DNA using the primers 5′-GGGAGATCTATGAGTGCTTCCAAAATGGCG-3′ and 5′-CCCGAGCTCAGGCTCCTCCCATTGCGAG-3′. The PCR product was digested with BglII and SacI (sites underlined) and cloned into the BglII and SacI sites of the yeast GFP fusion vector pGFP-X 2M. T. Geraghty, D. Bassett, J. C. Morrell, G. J.

The YJR019C ORF was reamplified by PCR from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA using the primers 5′-CCCGTCGACCATGAGTGCTTCCAAAATGGCCATG-3′ and 5′-CCCGCGGCCGCTCAGAACTTGGCTCGAATGTCTCG-3′. This PCR product was digested with SalI and NotI (sites underlined) and cloned into the SalI and NotI sites of pMBP, a modified form of the pMALc2 expression vector (New England Biolabs) to make pJMJ19. The entire hTE ORF was amplified by PCR from human muscle cDNA using the primers 5′-CCCGGATCCGGCTCGAGCATGTCGTCCCCGCAGGCCCCAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CCCTCTAGAGCGGCCGCCTCTGGCTAAAGCTTGCTCTCTG-3′. A form of hTE lacking the final two codons of the ORF (hTEΔKL) was amplified using the oligonucleotide 5′-CCCTCTAGAGCGGCCGCCTCTGGCTAAAGCTAGCTCTCTG-3′ in conjunction with the first hTE primer above. These oligonucleotides append BamHI and XhoI sites to the 5′ end and XbaI and NotI sites to the 3′ end of the ORF. The PCR product was digested with BamHI andXbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites in pMALc2. The resulting plasmids were denoted pMBP-hTE for the completehTE ORF and pMBP-hTEΔKL for the truncated form. The sequences of all ORFs in pMBP and pMALc2 were confirmed by automated fluorescent sequencing. The BamHI-XbaI fragment from pMBP-hTE was excised and transferred to the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-Nmyc, a modified version of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). This plasmid contains the sequence 5′-AAGCTTACCATGGCGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCCGAGGAGGACCTGCTGGGATCC-3′ between the HindIII and BamHI sites of pcDNA3 and is designed to express proteins in fusion with an amino-terminal myc epitope. All bacterial manipulations were performed in the Escherichia coli strain DH10B (8Grant S.G. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Hanahan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4645-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The yeast strains FY86 (9Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), BY4733 (10Baker-Brachmann C. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D.

The yeast strain BY4733,yjr019cΔ::HIS3 was generated by PCR-mediated, one-step gene replacement as described by Baker-Brachmannet al. (10Baker-Brachmann C. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotides YJR019Cko.5 (5′-AGTATCCACCATGAGCAAGACAAGATAAGACAAGATTGCATAAAAAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC-3′) and YJR019Cko.3 (5′-ATAAGAATATATATGTATGTGTTTATACGTGGGAGGGAATTGTCCCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG-3′). Disruption of YJR019C was confirmed by PCR analysis of HIS3+ clones. For routine culture, yeast strains were grown on either rich medium (YPD: 1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose) or synthetic medium (SC: 0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 2% dextrose, supplemented with amino acids and nucleotides appropriate for each experiment). For analysis of RNA levels, growth on ethanol was in YPE (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, and 2% ethanol) and growth on oleic acid was in YPOLT (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 0.02% Tween 40, and 0.2% oleic acid). For growth curves, growth on oleic acid was in SYOLT (0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.02% Tween 40, and 0.2% oleic acid). BY4733 cells were maintained in midlog phase growth for 24–48 h in YPOLT or YPE medium. Two-liter cultures of cells were then harvested at an A 600of 1.0 and RNA was extracted using standard procedures (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using Dynabeads according to the manufacturer's directions (Dynal, Inc.). 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was loaded per lane, separated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membranes. Filters were prepared for hybridization and hybridized with radiolabeled DNA fragments using standard protocols (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmid pGFP-YJR019C was used to transform the strain FY86 and its pex3 derivative to uracil prototrophy. The resulting strains were grown for 24 h in minimal medium lacking uracil. Cells were washed once in minimal medium and then transferred to YPOLT and grown for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested and attached to cover glasses coated with poly-l-lysine. The subcellular distribution of GFP-YJR019C was determined by confocal fluorescence and phase contrast microscopy. Preparation of high salt-extracted peroxisomal proteins from oleic acid-induced SKQ2N cells and their further separation by reverse phase HPLC was performed as described by Erdmann and Blobel (11Erdmann R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). HPLC fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE. Fractions 26–28 were pooled, separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Protein bands were visualized with 0.1% Amido Black in 10% acetic acid and subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis (13Fernandez J. Demott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 569-573Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal 12 amino acids of a 40-kDa protein in these fractions corresponded precisely to the amino-terminal 12 amino acids of the deduced YJR019C sequence. Wild-type BY4733 cells, pex8 cells (BY4733, pex8Δ::HIS3), andyjr019c cells (BY4733,yjr019cΔ::HIS3) were maintained in midlog phase for 2 days in YPD or selective medium. Cells were washed with water and used to inoculate 30 ml of SYOLT medium at an initialA 600 of 0.001. Growth was assessed by removing 1-ml aliquots, washing the cells twice with water, and measuring theA 600. Aliquots were removed at 24-h intervals for 168 h. 50-ml cultures of DH10B cells containing either the pMBP-hTEΔKL or the pMBP-YJR019C plasmid were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. 40 ml of this culture were diluted into 1 liter of 2YT media (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This culture was grown at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 0.4, at which time isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm to induce protein expression. The induced culture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h for cells containing pMBP-hTEΔKL or 30 °C for 15 h for cells containing pMBP-YJR019C. Cells were harvested, washed with Luria broth, and resuspended in 25 ml of amylose column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The cell suspension was incubated on ice with 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme for 20 min. After this incubation the cells were frozen in liquid N2, thawed at 37 °C, and sonicated briefly at high intensity. This cycle of freezing, thawing, and sonication was repeated twice for a total of three cycles. A cleared lysate was generated by centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 20 min. Proteins were purified by one-step affinity chromatography using a 10-ml amylose-agarose (New England Biolabs) column according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing highly purified (>90% purity) MBP-YJR019C (M r ≃ 83,000) or MBP-hTEΔKL (M r ≃ 79,000) were pooled and precipitated with 0.4 g/ml (NH4)2SO4. Aliquots of the purified fusion proteins were stored at −70 C until needed. For preparations of whole cell lysates, BY4733 cells or their yjr019c derivative were grown for 24 h in YPD, washed once with water, and transferred to YPOLT for an additional 24 h. Cells were incubated in reducing buffer (50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 20 min at 20 °C. The cells were then converted to spheroplasts in KPi-sorbitol buffer (50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, and 1.2 m sorbitol) using 0.1 unit of Zymolase (ICN Biomedical) per A 600 equivalent of cells for 30 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted and resuspended in 40 ml of Dounce buffer (5 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.0, 0.6 m sorbitol, 1 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% ethanol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin). The spheroplasts were then homogenized by 10 passes in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton) followed by brief high intensity sonication. A cleared lysate was generated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total protein concentration in each lysate was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (New England Biolabs). 18.1 μg of total protein from each lysate were added to the assay mixture (100 μm n-decanoyl-CoA, 0.1 mm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 50 mm KPi, pH 8.0) and the absorbance at 412 nm (A 412) was read at 5-s second intervals for 5 min. For assays of purified proteins, 0.75 μg of the two recombinant MBP fusion proteins were added to 50 mm KPi, pH 8.0, containing a mixture of 0.1 mm5,5′dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and five different concentrations (2, 5, 20, 50, and 100 μm) of n-decanoyl-CoA. TheA 412 was monitored at 5-s intervals for 2 min. Recombinant MBP-YJR019C was assayed at 30 °C, whereas recombinant MBP-hTE was assayed at 37 °C. One unit of thioesterase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 μmol of substrate/min. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were done in transformed human skin fibroblasts (GM5756-T) or the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2. The cell line PBD100 was derived from a Zellweger syndrome patient, has inactivating mutations inPEX10, and has been described previously (14Warren D.S. Morrell J.C. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell lines were cultured and transfected as described (15Slawecki M. Dodt G. Steinberg S. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Gould S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1817-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After electroporation, cells were resuspended in complete medium, transferred onto cover glasses, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described (15Slawecki M. Dodt G. Steinberg S. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Gould S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1817-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Permeabilization was normally performed for 5 min with 1% Triton X-100, which permeabilizes both plasma and peroxisome membranes. For selective permeabilization of only the plasma membrane, the cells were incubated for 5 min in 25 μg/ml digitonin instead of Triton X-100. Rabbit antibodies to hTE were generated against purified MBP-hTEΔKL. Immune serum was used directly for immunofluorescence experiments. Rabbit anti-PMP70 antibodies were obtained from Dave Valle and Gerardo Jimenez-Sanchez. The anti-myc mouse monoclonal antibody, anti-catalase sheep monoclonal antibody, and fluorescent secondary antibodies were obtained from commercial sources. For immunoblot experiments, anti-hTE antibodies were affinity purified using MBP-hTEΔKL covalently linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein-coupled column was prepared and used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Immune serum was diluted 1:15 in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and passed over the column. The column was washed with 30 bed volumes of TBST, and the purified anti-hTE antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, and precipitated with 0.4 g/ml (NH4)2SO4 for storage. Anti-myc polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Expression of proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) was according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the pcDNA3-Nmyc plasmid containing either the hTEopen reading frame or that of an unrelated peroxisomal enzyme. Subcellular fractionation of rat liver was as described by Mihalik (16Mihalik S.J. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1992; 357: 239-244Google Scholar). Immunoblots were performed as described by Crane et al. (17Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21835-21844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A screen for potential fatty acid-regulated genes in yeast identified a consensus oleate response element (CGGN3TNAN(6–13)(C/G)CG) in the YJR019C promoter region (Fig.1).2 To test whetherYJR019C is regulated by fatty acids, we determined the relative abundance of YJR019C mRNA in yeast grown in medium containing either oleic acid or ethanol. Both oleic acid and ethanol are converted to acetyl-CoA before use in further metabolic or biosynthetic pathways. Therefore, any increases in mRNA levels in yeast grown on oleic acid versus those grown on ethanol should reflect changes specific to fatty acid metabolism. Polyadenylated RNA was extracted from log phase yeast grown in either oleic acid medium (YPOLT) or ethanol medium (YPE) and analyzed by Northern blot with the YJR019C gene as probe (Fig.2). Although a significant amount ofYJR019C mRNA was present in ethanol-grown cells, the level of YJR019C mRNA was increased greatly in oleate-grown cells. The promoter region of YEL020C lacks ORE-like elements, and its mRNA was present at similar levels in cells grown in either oleic acid or ethanol medium.Figure 2YJR019C is an oleate-induced gene.Northern blots containing 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane were probed with radiolabeled fragments of the YJR019C(upper panel) and YEL020C (lower panel) genes.

Because YJR019C was induced by fatty acids and encodes a protein with a PTS1-like sequence at its carboxyl terminus (alanine-lysine-phenylalanineCOOH), we tested whether theYJR019C gene product might be located in peroxisomes. Previous studies have established that GFP can be targeted to peroxisomes by fusion to peroxisomal proteins (18Kalish J.E. Keller G.A. Morrell J.C. Mihalik S.J. Smith B. Cregg J.M. Gould S.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3275-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We therefore fused the GFP ORF to the amino-terminal end of the YJR019C ORF in an oleate-inducible expression vector and introduced this vector into the wild-type yeast strain FY86. The distribution of the GFP-YJR019C fusion protein was assessed by confocal and phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 3 A). GFP fluorescence was present in discrete punctate structures typical of S. cerevisiae peroxisomes. To determine whether these structures were in fact peroxisomes, we next examined the distribution of this fusion protein in a pex3Δ derivative of FY86 (PEX3 is required for peroxisomal matrix protein import; Ref. 19Höhfeld J. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1167-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In thepex3 strain, GFP fluorescence was found throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 B), a distribution that is expected for a peroxisomal matrix protein. The identification of YJR019C as a peroxisomal protein was also accomplished by a direct biochemical approach. In an independent attempt to identify the constituents of peroxisomes, highly purified peroxisomes were isolated from yeast grown in oleic acid medium. Soluble matrix proteins were removed by hypotonic lysis of the peroxisomes, and membrane-associated proteins were released by high salt wash of the peroxisomal membrane. The proteins released by high salt extraction were then separated by reverse phase HPLC as described previously (11Erdmann R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). HPLC fractions were separated further by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and visualized by Amido Black staining. Individual bands were then subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis. The amino-terminal sequence of an ∼40-kDa protein, which eluted in fractions 26–28, corresponded to the deduced amino terminus of YJR019C (Fig. 4). These results demonstrated that YJR019C is an abundant membrane-associated component of yeast peroxisomes. Because YJR019C mRNA was highly induced by oleic acid and encoded a peroxisomal protein, we next tested whether YJR019C might have a role in growth on fatty acids. A yjr019cΔ derivative of BY4733 was created, and its growth on oleic acid medium was compared with that of the wild-type BY4733 strain and a pex8 derivative of BY4733. Theyjr019c cells exhibited a partial growth defect, growing to 53% of the final wild-type density, whereas the pex8 strain showed the typical pex phenotype, growing to ∼20% of wild-type density (Fig. 5 A). Thus, YJR019C appears to play an ancillary role in growth on fatty acids. The deduced product of YJR019C shared significant amino acid similarity with tesB, a bacterial acyl-CoA thioesterase (20Naggert J. Narasimhan M.L. DeVeaux L. Cho H. Randhawa Z.I. Cronan Jr., J.E. Green B.N. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11044-11050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of YJR019C resulted in a loss of ∼80% of the total n-decanoyl-CoA esterase activity in yeast cells (Fig.5 B). To test directly whether YJR019C is an acyl-CoA thioesterase, we expressed and purified YJR019C in fusion with maltose-binding protein. MBP-YJR019C had significant acyl-CoA thioesterase activity using n-decanoyl-CoA as substrate, exhibiting a specific activity of 6.1 units/mg at 30 °C. The amino acid sequence of YJR019C was used to scan the data base of expressed sequence tags for any human homologues of this yeast thioesterase. Multiple human expressed sequence tags were identified, all of which corresponded to a single, previously characterized gene, hTE (21Liu L.X. Margottin F. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13779-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Watanabe H. Shiratori T. Shoji H. Miyatake S. Okazaki Y. Ikuta K. Sato T. Saito T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of hTE shows 26.3% identity to YJR019C and, like its yeast counterpart, contains a PTS1 motif (serine-lysine-leucineCOOH) at its carboxyl terminus (Fig. 6). Although hTE has been shown previously to have acyl-CoA thioesterase activity, we tested its activity as an MBP fusion for direct comparison with YJR019C. MBP-hTE displayed a specific activity of 12 units/mg hTE at 37 °C, an activity similar to that of MBP-YJR019C. Given that thehTE gene product is similar to YJR019C and has a canonical PTS1 sequence, we tested whether hTE encoded a peroxisomal protein. To address this issue, we first modified the hTEORF to include a 10-amino acid myc tag at its 5′ end. A plasmid designed to express this myc-hTE fusion, pcDNA3-Nmyc-hTE, was introduced into human skin fibroblasts. Indirect immunofluorescence experiments revealed that Nmyc-hTE was localized to peroxisomes (Fig.7 A), as determined by colocalization with the peroxisomal marker protein PMP70 (Fig.7 B). To assess whether Nmyc-hTE was imported into the peroxisome lumen, we repeated these experiments under differential permeabilization conditions. Skin fibroblasts expressing pcDNA3-Nmyc-hTE were permeabilized with a limiting amount of digitonin, which permeabilizes the plasma membrane but does not permeabilize the peroxisomal membrane. Indirect immunofluorescent labeling of Nmyc-hTE in digitonin-permeabilized cells showed only background cytosolic staining, even though PMP70-containing peroxisomes were readily detected (Fig. 7, C andD). The PMP70 antibodies that were used in these experiments recognize the cytosolic domain of this peroxisomal membrane protein. These results demonstrate that Nmyc-hTE is translocated into the peroxisome lumen. Zellweger syndrome is caused by defects in genes that are required for peroxisome biogenesis, and cells from Zellweger syndrome patients display defects in peroxisomal matrix protein import (23Lazarow P.B. Moser H.W. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2287-2324Google Scholar). As an independent test of whether hTE is a peroxisomal protein, we expressed Nmyc-hTE in the Zellweger syndrome cell line PBD100. This cell line is homozygous for an inactivating mutation in PEX10 and is unable to import peroxisomal matrix proteins, although it does contain numerous peroxisomes and imports peroxisomal membrane proteins normally (14Warren D.S. Morrell J.C. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Nmyc-hTE accumulated in the cytosol of PBD100 cells, as would be expected for a peroxisomal matrix protein, although intact peroxisomes were detected using antibodies to PMP70 (Fig. 7, E andF). Previous studies identified hTE as a protein that interacts with HIV-Nef (21Liu L.X. Margottin F. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13779-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Watanabe H. Shiratori T. Shoji H. Miyatake S. Okazaki Y. Ikuta K. Sato T. Saito T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Given that there is no evidence that HIV-Nef is peroxisomal, we tested whether endogenously synthesized hTE was located in peroxisomes using antibodies raised against a bacterially synthesized version of hTE. The immune sera recognize peroxisomes, as evident from their colocalization with the peroxisomal marker protein catalase (Fig. 8, A andB). In contrast, the preimmune sera do not recognize peroxisomes (Fig. 8, C and D). The distribution of this mammalian thioesterase was also assessed by subcellular fractionation experiments. We first generated affinity-purified anti-hTE antibodies and tested whether they recognized the product of the hTE gene. Rabbit reticulocyte lysates were used to synthesize either Nmyc-hTE or an unrelated myc-tagged protein, and the two lysates were then examined by immunoblot. Affinity purified anti-hTE antibodies recognized a protein of the correct molecular mass only in the lysate in which Nmyc-hTE was synthesized (Fig. 9 A). Anti-myc polyclonal antibodies confirmed expression of both proteins (data not shown). Next, a postnuclear supernatant was prepared from rat liver and separated by Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation. Fractions across the gradient were assayed for peroxisomal and mitochondrial markers as well as by immunoblot with the affinity purified anti-hTE antibodies (Fig. 9 B). These antibodies detected a 36-kDa protein in rat liver peroxisomes, as well as in cytosolic fractions at the top of the gradient. Peroxisomes will rupture during homogenization and centrifugation, releasing peroxisomal matrix proteins to the cytosol. Peroxisome rupture in this experiment is confirmed by the presence of significant catalase activity in the fractions at the top of the gradient. Although the amount of cytoplasmic thioesterase may be partly explained by peroxisome rupture, we cannot rule out the possibility that a small pool of thioesterase exists in the cytoplasm at steady state. These results support the hypothesis that hTE is a peroxisomal protein but do not rule out the possibility that some hTE may be cytosolic and available to interact with HIV-Nef. In this report we have demonstrated that YJR019C is an oleate-regulated gene that encodes a novel peroxisomal protein. Furthermore, we find that YJR019C is required for the majority of acyl-CoA thioesterase activity in yeast cells and show that recombinant YJR019C displays significant acyl-CoA thioesterase activity in vitro. The physical segregation of peroxisomal YJR019C from cytosolic fatty acid synthetase, the enzyme required for fatty acid synthesis, provides compelling evidence that the peroxisomal thioesterase is not involved in fatty acid synthesis. Our finding that loss of YJR019C results in impaired growth on fatty acids implicates this gene in fatty acid oxidation, a process that is exclusively peroxisomal in yeast. The fact that the human homologue ofYJR019C, the previously identified hTE gene, also encodes a peroxisomal thioesterase suggests that there may be a conserved role for this enzyme in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. We propose that YJR019C and human hTE both be renamed PTE1 to reflect the peroxisomal distribution and acyl-CoA thioesterase activity of their gene products. Fatty acids must be esterified with CoA before their β oxidation. Thus, it is somewhat paradoxical that a peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase is required for normal growth of yeast on fatty acids. In fact, our current understanding of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in yeast provides no direct role for thioesterase activity in fatty acid β oxidation or growth on fatty acids. Therefore, it is important to consider possible indirect roles for PTE1 in fatty acid oxidation. Previous studies have established that the peroxisome membrane is impermeable to small molecules such as NAD and NADP (24van Roermund C.W. Hettema E.H. Kal A.J. van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25van Roermund C.W. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As a result, loss of enzymes involved in NAD regeneration lead to loss of NAD-dependent activities within the peroxisome, including fatty acid oxidation. If the peroxisome membrane is also impermeable to CoASH, then the intraperoxisomal free CoASH pool may also be dependent on constant regeneration. Previous studies in yeast have established that CoASH regeneration would occur via complete oxidation of acyl-CoAs to acetyl-CoA, followed by transfer of acetate to carnitine and release of CoASH in a reaction catalyzed by CAT1 (26Elgersma Y. van Roermund C.W. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3472-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, if CoA were appended to poorly metabolized or nonmetabolizable fatty acids, CoASH levels would be expected to fall as more and more CoA was incorporated into these metabolic sinks. In this scenario, a peroxisomal thioesterase that acted primarily at high acyl-CoA and/or CoASH levels might serve a stimulatory role in fatty acid oxidation by providing an alternative mechanism for generating the free CoASH that is necessary for fatty acid β oxidation. As for the fate of the fatty acids that may be released, these would be free to equilibrate with cellular and extracellular pools, reducing their concentration in the peroxisome. This indirect model for PTE function has the potential to explain the fact that loss of PTE1 impairs growth of yeast on fatty acids, but we readily admit that there is not yet any independent corroborating evidence in its favor. As such, it should be viewed with skepticism. At the same time, it is worthwhile to consider this model as a possible explanation for the role of mammalian PTE1. If CoASH depletion does serve to inhibit peroxisomal fatty acid β oxidation in yeast, we might also expect CoASH depletion to pose problems for fatty acid oxidation in mammalian peroxisomes and mitochondria. In fact, a similar hypothesis has been proposed to explain the function of rat mitochondrial thioesterase (6Lee K.Y. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4516-4523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative role for mammalian peroxisomal thioesterases has also been suggested (7Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal β oxidation in mammalian cells differs from the yeast system in that it does not oxidize fatty acids completely. Instead, it transfers medium chain fatty acids out of the peroxisome as acyl-carnitine (27Mannaerts G. van Veldhoven P. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These are then exported to mitochondria where their oxidation is completed. This facet of mammalian peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation led to the hypothesis that peroxisomal thioesterases may serve to regulate the chain length at which fatty acids are exported (7Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, there are three flaws with this model. First, mammalian peroxisomal carnitine acyltransferase accepts fatty acids in the form of CoA esters, not as free acids (28Farrell S.O. Fiol C.J. Reddy J.K. Bieber L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13089-13095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear how a thioesterase would contribute to acyl-carnitine export. Second, the chain length specificities of mammalian peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes are thought to be sufficient to control the extent to which fatty acyl-CoAs are shortened in peroxisomes (7Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Mannaerts G. van Veldhoven P. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Third, this model cannot explain the presence of a thioesterase in yeast peroxisomes, because they oxidize fatty acids to completion (29Kunau W.-H. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1992; 375: 9-18PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of PTE1 in both yeast and human cells raises the question of whether they correspond to previously described peroxisomal enzymes. This is clearly not the case for yeast PTE1, because this report is the first description of this enzyme activity in yeast peroxisomes. However, there have been several reports of peroxisomal thioesterases in mammalian cells (4Svensson L.T. Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A purification of rat liver peroxisomal thioesterases revealed that myristoyl-CoA thioesterase activity eluted in two peaks, one of ∼35 kDa and one of larger size (4Svensson L.T. Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The product of human PTE1 has a deduced M rof 36 kDa and may represent the human homologue of the smaller rat peroxisomal thioesterase. A second study found peroxisomal thioesterase activity to be present in a broad peak of ∼40 kDa (7Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, subsequent fractionation of this sample led to the purification of a single thioesterase of ∼46 kDa. Interestingly, the putative cytosolic thioesterase 1 contains a PTS1-like sequence at its carboxyl terminus, proline-lysine-isoleucineCOOH, and has a deducedM r of 46 kDa (30Lindquist P.J.G. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A further analysis of cytosolic thioesterase 1 distribution may resolve the question of whether it actually represents a second, 46-kDa thioesterase of peroxisomes. The localization of human PTE1 (hTE) to the peroxisome lumen was observed for an overexpressed, epitope-tagged version ofHsPTE1 as well as for the endogenously synthesized, wild-type HsPTE1 of human fibroblasts. Thus, there is little doubt that this protein is predominantly peroxisomal. However, it is also true that human PTE1 (hTE) was first identified because of its interaction with HIV-Nef in the yeast two-hybrid system (21Liu L.X. Margottin F. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13779-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Watanabe H. Shiratori T. Shoji H. Miyatake S. Okazaki Y. Ikuta K. Sato T. Saito T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There is no indication that Nef is associated with peroxisomes, nor is there any known role for peroxisomes in the life cycle of HIV. Nevertheless, the interaction between PTE1 (hTE) and HIV-Nef was also detected in lysates of CEM cells that stably expressed HIV-Nef. Although the PTE1-Nef interaction might have occurred after the formation of the cell-free lysate in these experiments, it is also quite possible that small amounts of PTE1 are present in the cytosol. Our fractionation data cannot rule out the possibility that some PTE1 may be cytoplasmic at steady state and available for interaction with HIV-Nef. Also, it is possible that HIV-Nef may bind PTE1 before its import into peroxisomes.

PAR-1 is expressed by primary myoblast cultures, and expression is repressed once myoblasts fuse to form myotubes. The current study was undertaken to investigate the hypothesis that thrombin inhibits myoblast fusion. Primary rodent myoblast cultures were deprived of serum to promote myoblast fusion and then cultured in the presence or absence of thrombin. Thrombin inhibited myoblast fusion, but another notable effect was observed; 50% of control cells were apoptotic within 24 h of serum deprivation, whereas less than 15% of thrombin-treated cells showed signs of apoptosis. Proteolysis was required for the effect of thrombin, but no other serine protease tested mimicked the action of thrombin. Neither a PAR-1- nor a PAR-4-activating peptide inhibited apoptosis or fusion, and myoblast cultures were negative for PAR-3 expression. Myoblasts exposed to thrombin for 1 h and then changed to medium without thrombin accumulated apoptosis inhibitory activity in their medium over the subsequent 20 h. Thus the protective action of thrombin appears to be effected through cleavage of an unidentified thrombin receptor, leading to secretion of a downstream apoptosis inhibitory factor. These results demonstrate that thrombin functions as a survival factor for myoblasts and is likely to play an important role in muscle development and repair.

The role of thrombin in these processes is not only dependent on its cleavage of fibrinogen but also on its ability to regulate the activity of cells such as leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells (1Liu L.

Many of the cellular actions of thrombin are known to be mediated by a seven-transmembrane domain, G-protein-coupled receptor PAR-11 that is activated by a thrombin cleavage event in its extracellular domain. Proteolysis generates a new N terminus that acts as a tethered ligand, binding to another site in the receptor and activating a signal transduction cascade (5Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I.

Results with mice genetically incapable of expressing PAR-1, however, have shown that not all of the effects of thrombin are mediated by this receptor, leading to the recent discovery of two additional thrombin receptors, PAR-3 and PAR-4, which are closely related to PAR-1 (7Ishihara H.

A knowledge of the factors that determine whether myoblasts will undergo proliferation or differentiation is essential for an understanding of postnatal growth and repair in skeletal muscle. A number of growth factors have been shown to influence these processes in cultured myoblasts. For example, fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor stimulate myoblast proliferation and inhibit differentiation (10Lim R.W. Hauschka S.L. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Linkhart T. Clegg C. Hauschka S. Dev.

Thrombin has been proposed to play a role in synapse elimination occurring at the neuromuscular junction during development, because the specific thrombin inhibitor hirudin blocks synapse elimination both in vitro andin vivo (12Liu Y.

Res. 1997; 87: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and in muscle cultures transcript levels and thrombin activity in the medium are increased by cholinergic stimulation (15Glazner G.W. Yadav K. Fitzgerald S. Coven E. Brenneman D.E. Nelson P.G. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PAR-1 is expressed by cultured myoblasts, but expression is repressed once myoblasts fuse to form myotubes (16Suidan H.S. Niclou S.P. Dreessen J. Beltraminelli N. Monard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29162-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, recent immunohistochemical studies in developing muscle indicate that loss of PAR-1 expression by myoblasts soon after fusion also occurs in vivo (17Abraham L.A. Jenkins A.L. Stone S.R. Mackie E.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thrombin was found to cause an increase in the number of cultured myoblasts, possibly through an increase in proliferation (16Suidan H.S. Niclou S.P. Dreessen J. Beltraminelli N. Monard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29162-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The aim of the current study was to investigate the ability of thrombin to influence myoblast differentiation. Expression patterns of PAR-1 in cultured myoblasts led to the hypothesis that thrombin inhibits myoblast fusion. Initial experiments were designed to test this hypothesis, but during the course of these studies it was observed that thrombin exerted a potent inhibitory effect on myoblast apoptosis. The results presented here document the effects of thrombin on fusion and apoptosis in primary myoblast cultures.DISCUSSIONExpression patterns of PAR-1 in primary cultures of myoblasts undergoing differentiation (16Suidan H.S. Niclou S.P. Dreessen J. Beltraminelli N. Monard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29162-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), as well as in developing muscle (17Abraham L.A. Jenkins A.L. Stone S.R. Mackie E.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), led us to predict that thrombin inhibits myoblast fusion. At the time that our experiments were being undertaken, a description of the inhibition of fusion by thrombin in the C2C12 myoblast cell line was published (25Guttridge D.C. Lau A. Tran L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24117-24120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The demonstration in the present study that this also occurs in primary myoblast cultures suggests that this is a reproducible and potentially important role for thrombin in myoblast function. Contrary to expectations, the effect of thrombin on fusion does not appear to be mediated by PAR-1, because TRAP-1 was not able to mimic it. It seemed possible that the TRAP-1 failed to elicit an effect because it was degraded during the course of the experiments; it has previously been demonstrated that an aminopeptidase is able to degrade TRAP-1 (27Coller B.S. Springer K.T. Scudder L.E. Kutok J.L. Ceruso M. Prestwich G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20741-20743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This possibility is, however, unlikely for the following reasons: 1) in the experiments presented here, fresh TRAP-1 was added to cultures every 4 h to ensure that adequate concentrations were maintained throughout the culture period; 2) addition of the aminopeptidase inhibitor, amastatin, to culture medium did not alter the failure of cells to respond to TRAP-1; and 3) a 1-h treatment with thrombin was sufficient to elicit a significant effect, indicating that prolonged activity of the peptide was unnecessary.In the above-mentioned study of the effect of thrombin on C2C12 cell fusion, thrombin was also shown to inhibit myogenin expression, an effect that could be mimicked by TRAP-1 (25Guttridge D.C.

These results, in combination with our own showing that thrombin causes a PAR-1-independent inhibition of fusion, suggest that thrombin regulates myoblast differentiation through multiple pathways.Our observation that thrombin inhibits myoblast apoptosis is novel and of considerable interest. Vaughan et al. (28Vaughan P.J. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5389-5401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that thrombin protects rat primary astrocytes and hippocampal neurons from cell death induced by hypoglycaemia and oxidative stress but did not describe the cell death inhibited by thrombin as apoptosis. In the current study the myoblast death inhibited by thrombin has been characterized as an apoptotic process not only on the basis of nuclear morphology and the presence of DNA strand breaks but also because of its requirement for protein synthesis demonstrated by the experiments with cycloheximide. The thrombin-induced protection from cell death observed by Vaughan et al. (28Vaughan P.J. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5389-5401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) appears to be mediated by PAR-1, because it can be reproduced using TRAP-1. The protective effect of thrombin in the current study uses a different pathway, because it is not mimicked by TRAP-1.The failure of primary myoblast cultures to express PAR-3 and their failure to respond to TRAP-4 in terms of apoptosis, fusion, or [Ca2+]i indicate that neither PAR-3 nor PAR-4 mediates the observed responses to thrombin. If none of the known thrombin receptors mediates inhibition of fusion and apoptosis in myoblasts, how does thrombin exert these effects? Both effects appear to be dependent on the proteolytic activity of thrombin, because PPACK thrombin was inactive in both assays. The effect is specific for thrombin, because no other serine protease tested was able to mimic the activity. Fig. 6 illustrates schematically the possible pathways of thrombin activity that have been considered in the current study. The possibility that thrombin exerts effects on myoblasts through cleavage of proteins secreted into the medium (Fig. 6, pathway 1) was ruled out by the demonstration that thrombin treatment of myoblast-conditioned medium did not generate inhibitory activity. Further information about the mechanism of the action of thrombin was obtained by experiments demonstrating that conditioned medium from thrombin-treated cells (in which the thrombin had been inactivated) could substitute for thrombin in apoptosis and fusion assays. The question arose of whether thrombin was acting on a cellular receptor to induce secretion of an inhibitor of apoptosis (Fig. 6, pathway 2) or simply releasing an inhibitor of apoptosis from the cell surface or extracellular matrix (Fig. 6, pathway 3). The fact that activity capable of inhibiting apoptosis and fusion continues to accumulate in medium up to 20 h after the removal of thrombin indicates that thrombin is not simply releasing activity from the cell surface or matrix. Thus we are left to conclude that the substrate of thrombin is an unidentified thrombin receptor (pathway 2).The results presented here suggest that thrombin plays an important role in muscle development by affecting the functional state of myoblasts in several different ways. Thrombin has previously been shown to increase myoblast number (16Suidan H.S. Niclou S.P. Dreessen J. Beltraminelli N. Monard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29162-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and our results indicate that thrombin inhibits both myoblast fusion and apoptosis. It is likely that during normal muscle development and growth an equilibrium between thrombin and other growth and/or differentiation factors determines the number of cells that progress through the full sequence of differentiation culminating in myotube formation. The question arises of whether thrombin is present in developing muscle in the absence of vascular disruption. Recent studies investigating the expression of prothrombin in developing muscle confirm that the protein is present in this tissue (14Citron B.A. Smirnova I.V. Zoubine M.N. Festoff B.W. Thromb. Res. 1997; 87: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, thrombin activity is increased in myotube cultures after cholinergic stimulation, in part by increasing prothrombin transcription (15Glazner G.W. Yadav K. Fitzgerald S. Coven E. Brenneman D.E. Nelson P.G. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that thrombin produced by myotubes during muscle development would take part in a negative feedback loop, limiting the number of myoblasts that fuse, and ensuring that some cells capable of proliferation remain to meet future needs.In normal adult muscle apoptosis appears to be a rare event (29Sandri M. Carraro U. Podhorska-Okolov M. Rizzi C. Arslan P. Monti D. Franceschi C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and our results suggest that thrombin may be important in maintaining this situation. It is also likely that thrombin plays a role in the recovery from muscle damage involving vascular disruption, partly through its effect on myoblast survival. Indeed, a thrombin concentration of 360 nm has been measured in the fluid phase of clotted blood (30Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), well above the levels required for maximal responses in our culture system. In a number of pathological situations, including exercise-induced muscle damage and muscular dystrophy, the proportion of muscle cells undergoing apoptosis increases (29Sandri M. Carraro U. Podhorska-Okolov M. Rizzi C. Arslan P. Monti D. Franceschi C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31Matsuda R. Nishikawa A. Tanaka H. J. Biochem.

It is of considerable interest to note that the incidence of apoptosis is elevated in skeletal muscle subjected to disuse or denervation, as compared with normal muscle (33Allen D.L. Linderman J.K. Roy R.R. Bigbee A.J. Grindeland R.E. Mukku V. Edgerton V.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C579-C587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Tews D.S. Goebel H.H. Schneider I. Gunkel A. Stennert E. Neiss W.F. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1997; 23: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because cholinergic stimulation of muscle fibers results in an increase in thrombin activity (15Glazner G.W. Yadav K. Fitzgerald S. Coven E. Brenneman D.E. Nelson P.G. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that a decrease in thrombin activity in denervated muscle allows the resultant apoptosis to occur. Thrombin is a trypsin-like serine proteinase that has a central role in hemostasis and thrombosis. The role of thrombin in these processes is not only dependent on its cleavage of fibrinogen but also on its ability to regulate the activity of cells such as leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells (1Liu L. Freedman J. Hornstein A. Fenton II., J.W. Ofosu F.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 88: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Piccardoni P. Evangelista V. Piccoli A. de Gaetano G. Walz A.

Many of the cellular actions of thrombin are known to be mediated by a seven-transmembrane domain, G-protein-coupled receptor PAR-11 that is activated by a thrombin cleavage event in its extracellular domain. Proteolysis generates a new N terminus that acts as a tethered ligand, binding to another site in the receptor and activating a signal transduction cascade (5Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar, 6Brass L.F. Hoxie J.A. Manning D.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Results with mice genetically incapable of expressing PAR-1, however, have shown that not all of the effects of thrombin are mediated by this receptor, leading to the recent discovery of two additional thrombin receptors, PAR-3 and PAR-4, which are closely related to PAR-1 (7Ishihara H.

Synthetic peptides corresponding to the tethered ligand sequence of PAR-1 and PAR-4 (but not PAR-3) have been shown to activate their respective receptor in the absence of proteolysis (5Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar, 8Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S. Farese Jr., R.V.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). During the process of muscle development, myoblasts proliferate and then undergo differentiation, fusing to form multinucleated myotubes. A knowledge of the factors that determine whether myoblasts will undergo proliferation or differentiation is essential for an understanding of postnatal growth and repair in skeletal muscle. A number of growth factors have been shown to influence these processes in cultured myoblasts. For example, fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor stimulate myoblast proliferation and inhibit differentiation (10Lim R.W. Hauschka S.L. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Linkhart T. Clegg C. Hauschka S. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have recently indicated that thrombin is an important regulator of muscle development. Thrombin has been proposed to play a role in synapse elimination occurring at the neuromuscular junction during development, because the specific thrombin inhibitor hirudin blocks synapse elimination both in vitro andin vivo (12Liu Y. Fields R.D. Festoff B.W. Nelson P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Zoubine M.N. Ma J.Y. Smirnova I.V. Citron B.A. Festoff B.W. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Prothrombin is expressed in developing muscle (14Citron B.A. Smirnova I.V. Zoubine M.N. Festoff B.W. Thromb. Res. 1997; 87: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and in muscle cultures transcript levels and thrombin activity in the medium are increased by cholinergic stimulation (15Glazner G.W. Yadav K. Fitzgerald S. Coven E. Brenneman D.E. Nelson P.G. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PAR-1 is expressed by cultured myoblasts, but expression is repressed once myoblasts fuse to form myotubes (16Suidan H.S. Niclou S.P. Dreessen J. Beltraminelli N. Monard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29162-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, recent immunohistochemical studies in developing muscle indicate that loss of PAR-1 expression by myoblasts soon after fusion also occurs in vivo (17Abraham L.A. Jenkins A.L. Stone S.R. Mackie E.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thrombin was found to cause an increase in the number of cultured myoblasts, possibly through an increase in proliferation (16Suidan H.S. Niclou S.P. Dreessen J. Beltraminelli N. Monard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29162-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The aim of the current study was to investigate the ability of thrombin to influence myoblast differentiation. Expression patterns of PAR-1 in cultured myoblasts led to the hypothesis that thrombin inhibits myoblast fusion. Initial experiments were designed to test this hypothesis, but during the course of these studies it was observed that thrombin exerted a potent inhibitory effect on myoblast apoptosis. The results presented here document the effects of thrombin on fusion and apoptosis in primary myoblast cultures. DISCUSSIONExpression patterns of PAR-1 in primary cultures of myoblasts undergoing differentiation (16Suidan H.S. Niclou S.P. Dreessen J. Beltraminelli N. Monard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29162-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), as well as in developing muscle (17Abraham L.A. Jenkins A.L. Stone S.R. Mackie E.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), led us to predict that thrombin inhibits myoblast fusion. At the time that our experiments were being undertaken, a description of the inhibition of fusion by thrombin in the C2C12 myoblast cell line was published (25Guttridge D.C. Lau A. Tran L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24117-24120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The demonstration in the present study that this also occurs in primary myoblast cultures suggests that this is a reproducible and potentially important role for thrombin in myoblast function. Contrary to expectations, the effect of thrombin on fusion does not appear to be mediated by PAR-1, because TRAP-1 was not able to mimic it. It seemed possible that the TRAP-1 failed to elicit an effect because it was degraded during the course of the experiments; it has previously been demonstrated that an aminopeptidase is able to degrade TRAP-1 (27Coller B.S.

This possibility is, however, unlikely for the following reasons: 1) in the experiments presented here, fresh TRAP-1 was added to cultures every 4 h to ensure that adequate concentrations were maintained throughout the culture period; 2) addition of the aminopeptidase inhibitor, amastatin, to culture medium did not alter the failure of cells to respond to TRAP-1; and 3) a 1-h treatment with thrombin was sufficient to elicit a significant effect, indicating that prolonged activity of the peptide was unnecessary.In the above-mentioned study of the effect of thrombin on C2C12 cell fusion, thrombin was also shown to inhibit myogenin expression, an effect that could be mimicked by TRAP-1 (25Guttridge D.C. Lau A. Tran L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24117-24120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results, in combination with our own showing that thrombin causes a PAR-1-independent inhibition of fusion, suggest that thrombin regulates myoblast differentiation through multiple pathways.Our observation that thrombin inhibits myoblast apoptosis is novel and of considerable interest. Vaughan et al. (28Vaughan P.J. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J.

In addition, thrombin activity is increased in myotube cultures after cholinergic stimulation, in part by increasing prothrombin transcription (15Glazner G.W. Yadav K. Fitzgerald S. Coven E. Brenneman D.E. Nelson P.G. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that thrombin produced by myotubes during muscle development would take part in a negative feedback loop, limiting the number of myoblasts that fuse, and ensuring that some cells capable of proliferation remain to meet future needs. In normal adult muscle apoptosis appears to be a rare event (29Sandri M. Carraro U. Podhorska-Okolov M. Rizzi C. Arslan P. Monti D. Franceschi C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and our results suggest that thrombin may be important in maintaining this situation. It is also likely that thrombin plays a role in the recovery from muscle damage involving vascular disruption, partly through its effect on myoblast survival. Indeed, a thrombin concentration of 360 nm has been measured in the fluid phase of clotted blood (30Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), well above the levels required for maximal responses in our culture system. In a number of pathological situations, including exercise-induced muscle damage and muscular dystrophy, the proportion of muscle cells undergoing apoptosis increases (29Sandri M. Carraro U. Podhorska-Okolov M. Rizzi C. Arslan P. Monti D. Franceschi C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31Matsuda R. Nishikawa A. Tanaka H. J. Biochem.

It is of considerable interest to note that the incidence of apoptosis is elevated in skeletal muscle subjected to disuse or denervation, as compared with normal muscle (33Allen D.L. Linderman J.K.

Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1997; 23: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because cholinergic stimulation of muscle fibers results in an increase in thrombin activity (15Glazner G.W. Yadav K. Fitzgerald S. Coven E. Brenneman D.E. Nelson P.G. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that a decrease in thrombin activity in denervated muscle allows the resultant apoptosis to occur.

https://openalex.org/W1983749281,"Prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS) is a self-activating and self-inactivating enzyme. Both the peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities have a limited number of catalytic turnovers. Sequential stopped-flow measurements were used to analyze the kinetics of PGHS-1 peroxidase self-inactivation during reaction with several different hydroperoxides. The inactivation followed single exponential kinetics, with a first-order rate constant of 0.2–0.5 s−1 at 24 °C. This rate was independent of the peroxide species and concentration used, strongly suggesting that the self-inactivation process originates after formation of Compound I and probably with Intermediate II, which contains an oxyferryl heme and a tyrosyl radical. Kinetic scan and rapid scan experiments were used to monitor the heme changes during the inactivation process. The results from both experiments converged to a simple, linear, two-step mechanism in which Intermediate II is first converted in a faster step (0.5–2 s−1) to a new compound, Intermediate III, which undergoes a subsequent slower (0.01–0.05 s−1) transition to a terminal species. Rapid-quench and high pressure liquid chromatography analysis indicated that Intermediate III likely retains an intact heme group that is not covalently linked with the PGHS-1 protein.

PGHS exhibits two enzymatic activities as follows: a cyclooxygenase activity that converts arachidonic acid to PGG2 and a peroxidase activity that transforms PGG2 to PGH2. Several oxidized reaction intermediates have been identified (1Lambeir A.M. Markey C.M. Dunford H.B. Marnett L.J. J. Biol.

PGHS first interacts with a peroxide substrate to generate Intermediate I, equivalent to Compound I of horseradish peroxidase. Intermediate I then converts to Intermediate II, equivalent to Complex ES of cytochrome cperoxidase, through an intramolecular electron transfer from a tyrosine residue to the oxidized porphyrin. The transiently formed tyrosyl radical present in Intermediate II has been demonstrated to be capable of oxidizing arachidonic acid to generate an arachidonic acid radical and beginning cyclooxygenase catalysis in both PGHS isoforms (5Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Tsai A. Palmer G. Xiao G. Swinney D.C. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol.

X-ray crystallographic data revealed that the presumed site of the tyrosyl radical, Tyr-385 in PGHS-1 (Tyr-371 in PGHS-2), is located between the heme- and arachidonate-binding sites, well positioned to serve a role in coupling the two enzyme activities (7Picot D.

These recent crystallographic findings substantiate the original branched-chain mechanism (2Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) which proposed that a tyrosyl radical generated in the peroxidase cycle leads to production of PGG2 as long as arachidonate is present. One important fundamental limit on prostaglandin synthesis is the characteristic self-inactivation of PGHS (10Smith W.L. Lands W.E.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3276-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A typical reaction kinetics profile for PGHS with arachidonate, monitored by oxygen uptake, shows an initial burst, reaches a maximum velocity, and gradually decreases to zero (10Smith W.L. Lands W.E.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3276-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This fall in cyclooxygenase activity is not due to exhaustion of substrate or product inhibition but is rather a consequence of suicide inactivation (10Smith W.L. Lands W.E.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3276-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 11Ohki S. Ogino N. Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

Each PGHS molecule thus exhibits only a limited number of turnovers before the cyclooxygenase activity disappears. With purified PGHS, this number of turnovers can be as high as 1300 and as low as 10 depending on the concentration of reductants and other factors (14Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. J. Biol.

Degradation of both peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities have been observed during the self-inactivation process, as evidenced by decay of enzyme activities (15Markey C.M. Alward A. Weller P.E.

Based on the protective effect of various reducing cosubstrates against self-inactivation in both enzyme activities (15Markey C.M. Alward A. Weller P.E. Marnett L.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17649-17657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a consensus has emerged that certain active radical intermediates generated in peroxidase or cyclooxygenase catalysis lead to irreversible loss of enzyme activity. However, a direct linkage between a particular radical species and self-inactivation has yet to be established. The present study concentrates on peroxidase self-inactivation in the absence of exogenous reducing substrate to simplify the interpretations. The results provide convincing evidence that the self-inactivation step occurs subsequent to formation of Intermediate II and is thus independent of peroxide structure and concentration. Hydrogen peroxide, guaiacol, and hemin were purchased from Sigma. Arachidonic acid was from Nu Chek Prep (Elysian, MN). EtOOH was purchased as a 5% aqueous solution from Polysciences Inc. (Warrington, PA) or from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp. (Westbury, NY) as a 10% solution. PPHP was the product of Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Chloroperbenzoic acid was from Aldrich and was recrystallized in water. 15-HPETE was prepared according to Graff et al. (23Graff G. Anderson L.A. Jaques L.W. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) using arachidonate and soybean lipoxygenase. The purity of 15-HPETE was assessed chromatographically and its concentration quantified from the oxidation of TMPD catalyzed by excess PGHS-1 as described previously (17Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was purchased from Calbiochem or Amresco (Solon, OH). Tween 20 was purchased from Pierce or Bio-Rad. PGHS was prepared as the apoenzyme from ram seminal vesicles as described previously, with 5 mm glutathione included in the isoelectric focusing step (4Tsai A. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8885-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Benedetto C. McDonald-Gibson R.G. Nigam S. Slater T.F. Prostaglandins and Related Substances: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 209-227Google Scholar). PGHS holoenzyme was formed by adding heme to the apoenzyme. Unbound heme was removed by treatment with DE52 cellulose gel (Whatman, UK). The concentration of PGHS holoenzyme was based on the concentration of incorporated heme determined from the absorbance at 411 nm (165 mm−1cm−1). Cyclooxygenase activity was assayed polarographically at 30 °C as described previously (24Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Benedetto C. McDonald-Gibson R.G. Nigam S. Slater T.F. Prostaglandins and Related Substances: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 209-227Google Scholar). These experiments were conducted as two-stage reactions using a Bio-SEQUENTIAL DX-18MV stopped-flow instrument (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). PGHS holoenzyme was first mixed with a specific level of peroxide and aged for a defined length of time (100 ms to 10 s). This enzyme/peroxide reaction mixture was then mixed in the second stage with a solution containing guaiacol and hydrogen peroxide. Oxidation of guaiacol (monitored from absorbance changes at 436 nm) in the second stage was used to quantify the surviving peroxidase activity, with the peroxidase velocity calculated from the slope of the initial linear region of the ΔA 436 versus time traces. We chose to use the initial velocity and not the final extent of the guaiacol oxidation to quantify the residual peroxidase activity because secondary processes, including heme bleaching, complicate the later part of the reaction. In control experiments, carryover of peroxide from the first stage reaction was evaluated by including EtOOH or 15-HPETE in the guaiacol/H2O2 solution used in the second stage reaction and found to have negligible effect on the observed peroxidase velocity (data not shown). Measurements were performed on the Bio-Sequential stopped-flow instrument in the kinetic scan-spectral reconstruction mode or on an Olis RSM-1000 rapid-scan stopped-flow instrument (On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA). The former approach was used to acquire data over shorter wavelength ranges (typically, 390–430 nm in 2-nm increments) and at lower enzyme concentrations. Kinetic scan mode data obtained at serial wavelengths were first processed by the singular value decomposition (SVD) method (4Tsai A. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8885-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and then fitted to kinetic models using the Glint analysis package to deconvolute spectral intermediates. The Olis rapid-scan instrument was used principally to obtain spectral data in the visible region, where a more concentrated sample is required. Similar SVD analysis and global fitting routines were used to analyze data obtained with the Olis instrument to resolve dominant spectral intermediates and to determine the associated reaction rate constants. A set of published kinetic data and a mechanistic model for the PGHS peroxide reaction containing three spectral species (4Tsai A. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8885-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was used to validate the reliability of the SVD/global fitting software supplied with the Applied Photophysics and Olis instruments and achieved an excellent agreement. Covalent changes in the heme during the peroxide-induced self-inactivation were examined by a combination of rapid quench and HPLC analysis. PGHS (5–10 μm) was reacted with 10 eq of EtOOH for a defined period and then quenched with solvent (60% acetonitrile and 1.2% trifluoroacetic acid) at 24 °C in an Update Instrument System 1000 Chemical/Freeze Quench Apparatus (Madison, WI). The final concentrations of the reactants and quenching solvent after the two-stage mixing procedure were one-third the originals. Chemical-quenched samples were stored on Dry Ice until HPLC analysis. HPLC was performed with a Waters Model 600S controller and model 996 photodiode array detector and a Vydac C4 column (5 μm; 0.21 × 15 cm) equilibrated with Solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. A gradient was run to 75% Solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over 30 min and then to 100% Solvent B over the next 5 min. The absorbance was monitored at 220 and 400 nm to detect protein and heme species, respectively. Control experiments with sperm whale myoglobin and hydrogen peroxide confirmed efficient trapping of the reaction with this solvent quenching system (data not shown). The SCoP program (Simulation Resources Inc., Redlands, CA) was also used for kinetic simulations and for fitting of single wavelength kinetic data to the mechanistic model described below (4Tsai A. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8885-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The SCoP program allows testing of more complicated mechanistic models and direct evaluation of each dependent variable, providing information regarding the sensitivity of the overall kinetics to the value of each parameter. The equations in the SCoP program were derived from the mechanism in Scheme FS1 and are shown in Table I. The values ofk 1 and k 2 were from Ref.4Tsai A. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E.

Values for the floating parameters k 7 andk 8 were obtained from spectral deconvolution of kinetic scan and global fitting which will be detailed under “Results.” The rates of the reduction steps (k 3, k 4,k 5, and k 6) fall in the range commonly observed with PGHS peroxidase (19Hsuanyu Y.

No spectral distinction was made between Fe(IV) and Fe(IV)Tyr⋅ intermediates or between Fe(III)Tyr⋅ and Fe(III) species.

The initial velocity in the second stage reactions (with H2O2/guaiacol) is plotted as a function of the duration of the first stage reaction (with EtOOH) in Fig.1 B, along with corresponding data involving first stage reactions with other EtOOH levels. The surviving peroxidase activity (measured in the second stage reaction) followed essentially the same single exponential decay kinetics for all EtOOH levels between 7.8 to 250 μm (Fig. 1 B), with a first-order rate constant of ∼0.4 s−1 at 24 °C. Kinetic measurements of the peroxidase self-inactivation were extended to other peroxide substrates, including H2O2, 15-HPETE, and PPHP, at PGHS levels of 0.2–1.3 μm (Fig. 2). In each instance, the surviving peroxidase activity was determined by a second stage reaction with H2O2 and guaiacol, as described above for the experiments in Fig. 1 A. In each case, the decay in peroxidase activity was found to follow first-order kinetics as the first stage reaction time was increased (data not shown). The rates of self-inactivation were calculated by fitting the data to single-exponential equations, as in Fig. 1 B. From the data in Fig. 2 it is clear that the rate of peroxidase self-inactivation was essentially independent of peroxide structure and peroxide concentration for the four peroxides examined, with rates of 0.20–0.44 s−1 for H2O2, 0.22–0.54 s−1 for EtOOH, 0.22–0.46 s−1 for PPHP, and 0.1–0.5 s−1 for 15-HPETE. The overall average self-inactivation rate for the data in Fig. 2 was 0.40 s−1. It is also apparent from the data in Fig. 2that the rate of peroxidase self-inactivation was insensitive to the PGHS level over the 0.15–1.5 μm range. Optical spectral changes in the PGHS heme center were monitored during self-inactivation (Fig.3). Reconstructed spectra after SVD analysis from 390 to 430 nm for reaction between 1 μmPGHS-1 and 30 μm EtOOH are shown in Fig. 3 A. Resting enzyme had a Soret peak near 410 nm (spectrum a). Early in the reaction with EtOOH (0–0.5 s), the intensity of the Soret peak decreased and shifted to longer wavelengths, consistent with rapid sequential formation of Intermediates I and II. Subsequent spectra obtained after 0.5 s of reaction (thin lines in Fig.3 A) were consistent with a single transition. Spectral changes in this reaction period were highlighted by a maximal increase near 392 nm and a maximal decrease near 420 nm, with an isosbestic point at 405–406 nm. An additional, slower transition (dashed lines in Fig. 3 A) followed, finally yielding a spectrum characterized by a peak at 405 nm with a low absorption coefficient (lower heavy line in Fig. 3 A). These spectral data after the first 50 ms of reaction were further analyzed by the global fitting package, Glint, to obtain the spectra of the major components present in this part of the reaction. A simple mechanism, represented by Reaction 1, was used for the fitting, because the SVD analysis indicated three dominant species were present in that time range.A→B→CReaction 1 The three prominent spectral intermediates resulting from this fit are shown in Fig. 3 B, together with the spectrum of the resting enzyme. The first intermediate considered here (A in Reaction 1), with a peak at 413–414 nm (spectrum b), is very similar to published spectra of PGHS-1 Intermediate II, containing an oxyferryl heme and a tyrosyl radical (1Lambeir A.M.

The second intermediate observed (B in Reaction 1), called Intermediate III, exhibited a peak at 403–404 nm (spectrum c in Fig.3 B). The last spectroscopic intermediate observed (C in Reaction 1) had a peak at 412–413 nm (spectrum d in Fig. 3 B) and appears similar to the overall spectrum at the terminal stage of the reaction (spectrum bin Fig. 3 A). Accordingly, the mechanism in Reaction 1 can be refined as shown in Reaction 2.Intermediate II→Intermediate III→terminal speciesReaction 2 The rates of the two steps in Reaction 2 determined by global fit were 1.98 and 0.02 s−1, respectively. The inactivation rate determined for peroxidase activity, 0.4 s−1 (Figs. 1and 2), was much closer to that for the first spectroscopic transition, implying that irreversible loss of peroxidase activity accompanies formation of Intermediate III. The spectral changes observed during reaction of PGHS with PPHP and 15-HPETE were very similar to those shown in Fig. 3 A for EtOOH (data not shown). As was described for the EtOOH reactions, spectra for two intermediates were resolved by fitting the data to a two-step process (Reaction 2). The spectrum resolved for the earlier intermediate (Intermediate III in Reaction 2) had its peak at 415–416 nm for the reactions with PPHP and 15-HPETE, slightly longer than 413–414 nm found for the same intermediate during reaction with EtOOH. There were no obvious differences observed for the terminal species with different hydroperoxides. The double-monochromator Olis rapid scan instrument was used to obtain spectral data extending to the visible region for inactivation intermediates. Due to the weak absorbance of the intermediates in the visible region, a higher enzyme concentration (2.5 μm) was employed. Rapid scan spectral data obtained during reaction of PGHS with EtOOH were consistent with the two-step inactivation process in Reaction 2 and were fitted to the same mechanism (Fig.4). The spectral changes observed in the Soret region with the rapid scan instrument were very similar to those obtained by kinetic scan at incremental wavelengths using a lower level of PGHS (0.5 μm), thus confirming that the increased enzyme concentration did not change the self-inactivation mechanism. The resolved spectrum for Intermediate III obtained by SVD analysis and global-fitting of the rapid scan data to Reaction 2 (spectrum b in Fig. 4) was very similar to that obtained by the kinetic scan approach (spectrum c in Fig. 3 B) both in its absorption peak position and its intensity. In the visible region, Intermediate III displayed a single broad peak centered at 560 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 22.7 mm−1cm−1. This feature is absent from the spectra of resting enzyme and the terminal species (Fig. 4), indicating that the heme electronic configuration in Intermediate III is distinct from those of other recognized peroxidase intermediates. The rates obtained for the two steps in Reaction 2 from the rapid scan data were 0.46 and 0.032 s−1, respectively. The value for the fast spectral change here is essentially the same as that for peroxidase inactivation (Fig.2), supporting the contention that peroxidase inactivation accompanies Intermediate III formation. Rapid-quench experiments were conducted to look for covalent changes of the PGHS heme group. For this, PGHS was reacted with 10 eq of EtOOH, and aliquots were removed at various times for solvent quenching and HPLC analysis. As shown in Fig.5 A, the chromatographic profiles for the control sample (EtOOH was replaced by buffer) and the sample obtained at 5 s of reaction were very similar. The main heme peak, monitored by absorbance at 400 nm, eluted at 20.5 min and was clearly separated from the PGHS apoprotein peak registered by 220 nm absorbance, which elutes near 26 min. A time-dependent increase of a 400-nm absorbing species with a 21.7-min retention time was noticed at expanded scales, but it accounted for only a very small percentage the total heme. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the integrated area of the main A 400 peak changed little with reaction time. Thus, most of the PGHS heme remained chemically intact during the time the peroxidase was inactivated. Early kinetic events in the reaction of PGHS with peroxide, including formation and degradation of Intermediate I, were not considered in the SVD and global fitting to Reaction 2. In addition, minor spectral species and reactions involving recycling of higher oxidation states of heme were ignored to simplify data analysis. To validate these data manipulations, further analysis of PGHS self-inactivation by peroxide was conducted by simulation and fitting to the more complete mechanism shown in Scheme FS1 (Steps 1–8 listed in Table I) using the SCoP numerical integration program. In this mechanism, the reaction pathway divides at Intermediate II, with one route leading to Intermediate III and irreversible inactivation (viak 7) and the other route recycling the enzyme sequentially back to Compound II (or Fe(III) Tyr⋅) and resting PGHS (via k 3 or k 5). The rate constants for Steps 1 and 2 were taken from published data (4Tsai A. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8885-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The rate constants for the recycling steps, Steps 3–6, were set at 103 to 105m−1s−1, in line with literature values for various PGHS peroxidase cosubstrates (19Hsuanyu Y. Dunford H.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20MacDonald I.D. Graff G. Anderson L.A. Dunford H.B. Arch. Biochem.

Five equivalents of endogenous reductant were assumed in the simulations based on earlier estimates (25Tsai A.-L. Wu G. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13085-13094Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The simulations indicated that the flux through the recycling steps is minimal unless exogenous cosubstrate is added. The main determining factors for the speed of transitions in the 0.5–5-s period were the values of k 7 andk 8. To fit the simulations to the observed absorbance change kinetics, molar absorbance coefficients for individual wavelengths were based on the resolved spectra for Intermediates II and III and terminal species obtained in this study, and on previously published spectra corresponding to resting PGHS and Intermediate I (4Tsai A. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8885-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The floating parameters in the computer fitting included k 7 and k 8. Fittings that floated the k 3tok 6 parameters always converged with rate constant values of less than 105m−1 s−1. Floating the amount of endogenous reductant usually converged to values close to 0. These results indicate a minimal contribution of the reductive recycling steps (k 3 tok 6) to the overall kinetics. Typical kinetic data and fittings for three different wavelengths are shown in Fig.6. The initial rapid changes before 0.5 s reflect the formation of Intermediates I and II. The increase in A 392 and decrease inA 428, accompanied by a relatively staticA 404, in the 0.1–5-s period coincide with the conversion of Intermediate II to Intermediate III. The optimal values for k 7 and k 8 obtained in this fitting were 1.87 and 0.01 s−1, respectively. These values match nicely with those obtained by global fitting to th"

It has been suggested that opioid receptor phosphorylation is the mechanism by which this desensitization and down-regulation occurs. When MOR1TAG was stably expressed in both neuroblastoma neuro2A and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells, the opioid agonist [d-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) induced a time- and concentration-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor, in both cell lines, that could be reversed by the antagonist naloxone. Protein kinase C can phosphorylate the receptor, but is not involved in DAMGO-induced MOR1TAG phosphorylation. The rapid rate of receptor phosphorylation, occurring within minutes, did not correlate with the rate of the loss of agonist-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which occurs in hours. This lack of correlation between receptor phosphorylation and the loss of response was further demonstrated when receptor phosphorylation was increased by either calyculin A or overexpression of the G-protein receptor kinases. Calyculin A increased the magnitude of MOR1TAG phosphorylation without altering the DAMGO-induced loss of the adenylyl cyclase response. Similarly, when μ- and δ-opioid (DOR1TAG) receptors were expressed in the same system, overexpression of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 2 elevated agonist-induced phosphorylation for both receptors. However, in the same cell lines under the same conditions, overexpression of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 2 and β-arrestin 2 accelerated the rate of DPDPE- but not DAMGO-induced receptor desensitization. Thus, these data show that phosphorylation of MOR1TAG is not an obligatory event for the DAMGO-induced loss in the adenylyl cyclase regulation by the receptor.

Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). While autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase receptors by the associated kinases results in the initiation of the signal cascades, agonist-induced phosphorylation of the GPCRs by protein kinases, recruited to the vicinity of the receptors, blunts the signal cascades. Rapid phosphorylation of these GPCRs, by specific protein kinases, i.e. G-protein-coupled receptor kinases, GRKs, and the subsequent binding of arrestins, has been considered to be a mechanism for the agonist-induced homologous desensitization of these receptors (2Chuang T.T. Iacovelli L. Sallese M. De Blasi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 416-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 3Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). From the cloning of the receptors, it is clear that μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors belong to the superfamily of GPCRs (4Minami M. Satoh M. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 23: 121-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 5Knapp R.J. Malatynska E. Collins N. Fang L. Wang J.Y. Hruby V.J. Roeske W.R. Yamamura H.I. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As with other GPCRs, prolonged agonist treatment results in an attenuation of effector responses and down-regulation of the receptor, both in clonal cell lines that express the opioid receptor endogenously (6Law P.Y.

Chronic exposure to opioid agonist results in a reduced receptor affinity for the agonist, as well as diminished ability of the agonist to either inhibit cAMP accumulation (10Law P.Y. Hom D.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This reduction in the opioid agonist activity has been suggested to involve receptor phosphorylation. Pei and colleagues (15Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated phosphorylation of the δ-opioid receptor that appeared to parallel the loss in agonist inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in HEK293 cells. Transient transfection of the dominant negative mutant of βARK1 into these cells reduced the degree of receptor phosphorylation which suggested the involvement of GRKs in DOR1TAG phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the μ-opioid receptor in the presence of agonist has been demonstrated both in HEK293 (16Arden J.R. Segredo V. Wang Z. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and in Chinese hamster ovary cells (13Zhang L. Yu Y. Mackin S. Weight F.F. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11449-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Yu Y. Zhang L. Yin X. Sun H. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28869-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a parallel time course was reported between μ-opioid receptor phosphorylation in Chinese hamster ovary cells and the loss in μ-opioid receptor regulation of GIRK-1 inXenopus oocytes (13Zhang L. Yu Y. Mackin S. Weight F.F. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11449-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Co-injection of the cDNAs of DOR1TAG, β-arrestin 2, βARK2, and GIRKs has been shown to result in an increase in the rate of agonist-induced homologous desensitization of the δ-opioid receptor (14Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These data would tend to support the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the opioid receptor is the probable mechanism for the observed receptor desensitization. There are some inconsistencies, however, within the reported data on opioid receptor desensitization and phosphorylation. Although the phosphorylation of the opioid receptor has been reported to be very rapid, the agonist-induced loss of receptor activity as measured by either adenylyl cyclase activity or GIRK-1 channel activity, especially in the case of μ-opioid receptor, occurs rather slowly (6Law P.Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 413-423PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Comparing the rates of desensitization of the two splice variants of the μ-opioid receptor, MOR-1 and the shorter isoform MOR-1B receptors, Zimprich and colleagues (18Zimprich A. Simon T. Hollt V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) showed that MOR-1B desensitized more slowly than MOR-1. The authors attributed this difference to the absence of Thr394 in the splice variant MOR-1B. Subsequently, Pak et al. (19Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), reported that the mutation of Thr394 in the wild-type MOR-1 to Ala resulted in the complete blockade of the agonist-induced receptor desensitization. These data are in contrast with those reported in which the agonist could induce receptor desensitization in a μ-opioid receptor mutant in which all the Ser/Thr residues of the third intracellular loop and the carboxyl tail are mutated to alanine (20Capeyrou R. Riond J. Corbani M. Lepage J.F. Bertin B. Emorine L.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that in neither of these studies was receptor phosphorylation determined and therefore, it is uncertain whether the reported mutations have affected the overall phosphorylation of the receptor. Furthermore, the observed μ-opioid receptor phosphorylation in Chinese hamster ovary cells was not blocked by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, thus suggesting the involvement of GRKs (21Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, opioid receptor regulation of phospholipase C in Xenopusoocytes appeared to involve PKC (13Zhang L. Yu Y. Mackin S. Weight F.F. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11449-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and μ-opioid receptor desensitization in Xenopus oocytes, as measured with GIRK-1 regulation, was potentiated by PKC activation (13Zhang L. Yu Y. Mackin S. Weight F.F. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11449-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Consequently, the manner by which these data contribute to the role of receptor phosphorylation in the loss of opioid receptor activity remains to be demonstrated. In light of these discrepancies, we chose to investigate both receptor phosphorylation and desensitization in the same system. Exposure of HEK293 or neuro2A cells stably expressing the μ-opioid receptor to the opioid agonist DAMGO resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of the receptor protein, which is time- and agonist concentration-dependent. However, the phosphorylation of the receptor does not correlate directly to the loss of the μ-opioid receptor mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. Furthermore, alteration in the phosphorylation state of the δ- and μ-opioid receptors, expressed in the same system, induced differential regulation of these two receptor subtypes. These data suggest a pathway in which μ-opioid receptor phosphorylation may not be the major determinant in the eventual loss of agonist response.

Lefkowitz (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Durham, NC). cDNAs for the bovine βARK2 (GRK3) and βARK1K220R (GRK2K220R) were generous gifts from Dr. J. Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University Medical School, Philadephia, PA) and were subcloned into the expression vector pCDNA3. cDNA encoding the β-arrestin 2 was the generous gift of Dr. S. G. Ferguson (Dept. of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). Forskolin was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). DAMGO and other opioid ligands were supplied by NIDA, National Institutes of Health. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells and neuroblastoma neuro2A cells were stably transfected with the rat μ-opioid receptor cDNA, MOR-1, subcloned into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of the expression vector pCDNA3 by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (22Chen Y. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). In order to facilitate the identification of the μ-opioid receptor with both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA), recognized by the 12CA5 or 3F10 monoclonal antibodies (Boehringer Mannheim), was spliced into the NH2-terminal immediately after the initial methionine codon as described earlier (23Arvidsson U. Riedl M. Chakrabarti S. Lee J.H. Nakano A.H. Dado R.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Wessendorf M.W. Elde R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3328-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell colonies stably expressing the μ-opioid receptor were isolated by selection in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geniticin (G418) for 10 to 14 days, and confirmation of μ-opioid receptor expression was determined by whole cell binding using [3H]diprenorphine (specific activity 39.0 Ci/mmol) in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6. Specific binding is defined as the difference between the radioactivity bound to the cells in the presence and absence of 100 μm naloxone. The selected clones, identified as MOR1TAGID2 (for neuroblastoma neuro2A cells) or HEKMT (for HEK293 cells), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 250 μg/ml G418 under humidified atmosphere with 10% CO2. For transient transfection, the cDNA was introduced into the cells also by the calcium phosphate method and the assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Two separate methods were used in the determination of the opioid agonist effect on the intracellular cAMP. The experiments in which neuro2A MOR1TAGID2 cells were used, the effect of DAMGO on cAMP levels was determined by measuring the conversion of the [3H]adenine-labeled ATP pools to [3H]cAMP as described (6Law P.Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 413-423PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments when HEKMT were used, the intracellular cAMP level was determined by radioimmunoassay using 125I-acetylated cAMP and rabbit polyclonal antibodies which recognize the acetylated cAMP. In either method, cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2 × 105cells/well) 48 h prior to experiments. In the [3H]adenine assay, the cells were prelabeled for 2 h in 0.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 29.3 mmNaHCO3, 15.3 mm glucose, 15.4 mmNaCl, 2.5 μCi of [3H]adenine, and 0.25 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Immediately before challenging the cells, in both methods, the plates were placed on ice, the radioactive or growth media was removed and replaced by 0.5 ml of ice-cold Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer (KRHB: 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 25 mm glucose, 55 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.25 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 5 μmforskolin (or no forskolin in case of basal determination) with the indicated concentrations of DAMGO. The plates were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and the reaction terminated by addition of 50 μl of 3.3 n perchloric acid. In the case of the [3H]adenine assay, [32P]cAMP was added as an internal standard and the amount of [3H]cAMP synthesized was then separated from the other 3H-labeled nucleotides by double column chromatography as described by White and Karr (24White A.A. Karr D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the case of radioimmunoassay, the perchloric acid in each well was neutralized with 120 μl containing 2 m KOH, 1m Tris, and 60 mm EGTA. The amount of cAMP in each well was determined by comparing the ability of the diluted samples to compete for 125I-acetylated cAMP binding to the antibodies with that of standard concentrations of acetylated cAMP. In the experiments in which the rate and extent of desensitization were determined, cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of DAMGO for various time intervals (30 min to 4 h). The same concentration of DAMGO was included during the 2-h labeling of the ATP pools with [3H]adenine. After the incubation period, the media was removed and replaced with 0.5 ml of KRHB containing forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and DAMGO. The level of inhibition using 1 μm or 20 nm DAMGO in these chronic agonist-treated cells was determined by averaging the results from at least 3 passages of cells. Neuro2A (MOR1TAGID2) or HEK293 (HEKMT) cells were seeded at 70–80% confluence in 100-mm plates 24 h prior to receptor phosphorylation assay. On the day of the assay (90–100% confluence), cells were washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM and incubated in 4 ml of the same medium for 1 h at 37 °C and 10% CO2. Then, the cells were incubated with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h at 37 °C and 10% CO2. Agonists and other compounds were added as indicated. The reaction was stopped by putting the plates on ice, at which point the labeling medium was rapidly removed, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1%, v/v, Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, with 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20 μg/ml benzamidine as protease inhibitors and 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium vanadate as phosphatase inhibitors) in microcentrifuge tubes. The receptor was solubilized by rotating the samples for 1 h at 4 °C and the insoluble cellular debris was then removed by centrifuging the samples at 14,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted to twice the volume with lysis buffer (without Triton X-100) before loading onto 1-ml wheat germ lectin affinity columns pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The columns were then washed with 10 ml of Buffer A to remove non-bound radioactive proteins and the μ-opioid receptor-containing fraction was eluted with 3 ml of Buffer A containing 0.5 m N-acetylglucosamine, and the protease/phosphatase inhibitors as indicated above. The samples were incubated in the presence of either 2.5 μg of HA-monoclonal antibody or 5 μl of polyclonal antisera (552G) developed against the COOH-terminal of the receptor (23Arvidsson U. Riedl M. Chakrabarti S. Lee J.H. Nakano A.H. Dado R.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Wessendorf M.W. Elde R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3328-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 60 μl of slurry (50%) of prewashed immunopure protein A-agarose (or protein G-agarose) beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed twice with Buffer A and three times with Buffer A without NaCl. Afterward, receptor protein was dissociated from the beads by adding 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 3 m urea, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue). The samples were heated at 42 °C for 1 h and then separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and the phosphorylated proteins were visualized and quantified by using the PhosphorImager Storm 840 system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Saturation binding data were analyzed using the computer program Ligand, providing estimates of receptor density (B max) and agonist affinity (K d). Mean values from individual treatment groups were statistically analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with subsequent comparisons among treatment groups and from their control by the Student's t test. In cell lines stably expressing the μ-opioid receptors, prolonged treatment with agonists resulted in a gradual loss in the receptor activities (7Prather P.L. Tsai A.W. Loh H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). This loss in agonist activity has been attributed to the desensitization and down-regulation of the μ-opioid receptor. In order to investigate the role of receptor phosphorylation in such cellular adaptation processes, a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was introduced at the NH2terminus of μ-opioid receptor so as to facilitate the immunoprecipitation of the receptor with antibodies other than the polyclonal antibodies developed against the last 15 amino acids of the carboxyl tail sequence (23Arvidsson U. Riedl M. Chakrabarti S. Lee J.H. Nakano A.H. Dado R.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Wessendorf M.W. Elde R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3328-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chakrabarti S. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For HEK 293 clone (HEKMT), theK d and B max values for [3H]diprenorphine were determined to be 1.3 ± 0.16 nm (n = 2) and 13.1 ± 0.54 pmol/mg of protein (n = 2), respectively. 2A. Burd, L. Erickson, L. Dicker, C. Sheen, R. El Kouhen, E. Miller, H. Loh, and P. Law, manuscript in preparation. In previous studies, the K d and B maxvalues with the neuro2A clone (MOR1TAGID2) were determined to be 0.33 ± 0.02 nm (n = 3) and 1.9 pmol/mg of protein (n = 3), respectively (26Afify E.A. Law P.Y. Riedl M. Elde R. Loh H.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). There was no observable difference between epitope-tagged (MOR1TAG) or wild-type (MOR1 WT) receptor in the DAMGO affinity for the receptor and the potency of DAMGO to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in the neuro2A cells (25Chakrabarti S. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The EC50 to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity and K d of DAMGO in HEKMT cells have a value of 7.5 ± 1.6 nm (n = 3) and 4.2 ± 0.51 nm (n = 3), respectively,2 and compare favorably with those obtained with the MOR1TAGID2 cells. In the HEK 293 cells expressing the wild-type μ-opioid receptor, prolonged exposure to DAMGO resulted in the loss of the agonist ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The kinetics of the loss in agonist activity were monophasic and the rates were relatively slow. The receptor was completely desensitized after 24 h of DAMGO pretreatment (Fig. 1 A). Similar loss in the μ-opioid receptor activity in the neuro2A MOR1TAGID2 cells was observed (25Chakrabarti S. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For our studies, we tested the ability of 20 nm and 1 μm DAMGO to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. These concentrations correspond to the sigmoidal and the asymptotic region of the log dose-response curve, respectively (25Chakrabarti S. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, there was a time-dependent decrease in the ability of DAMGO to inhibit the intracellular cAMP production after 5 μm DAMGO pretreatment in both the MOR1TAGID2 and the HEKMT cells. The desensitization rate was very slow in both cell lines. It is not surprising that the loss of 1 μm DAMGO response was significantly slower than that in the loss of 20 nm DAMGO response, after 4 h of DAMGO pretreatment. However, it is surprising, that even the decrease in the activity of 20 nmDAMGO took a relatively long period of time (Fig. 1 B). In order to investigate the phosphorylation of the μ-opioid receptor in either the MOR1TAGID2 or HEKMT cells, immunoprecipitation of the receptor proteins with either the polyclonal antisera (552G), which recognize the TAPLP epitope of the carboxyl terminus of the μ-opioid receptor (23Arvidsson U. Riedl M. Chakrabarti S. Lee J.H. Nakano A.H. Dado R.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Wessendorf M.W. Elde R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3328-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or the monoclonal antibody (12CA5 or 3F10), which recognizes the HA epitope, was carried out. The problem of nonspecific phosphorylated proteins being immunoprecipitated by these antibodies was overcome by partial purification of the μ-opioid receptor. This partial purification was carried out by the adsorption of the receptor and other glycoproteins onto a wheat germ agglutinin column, followed by subsequent elution of the receptor from the columns with N-acetylglucosamine. Thus, in all our receptor phosphorylation studies, the Triton X-100 extracts of the total cellular proteins were partially purified with the wheat germ agglutinin columns as described under “Experimental Procedures” prior to immunoprecipitation. When the MOR1TAGID2 cells were radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with 5 μmDAMGO, purified receptor was resolved on SDS-PAGE and revealed a diffused phosphoprotein band migrating at approximately 65–75 kDa (Fig. 2, second lane). The migration of this phosphoprotein band in the SDS-PAGE corresponded to that of the HA epitope-tagged μ-opioid receptor when Western blot analysis was carried out with either polyclonal antiserum 552G or monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (23Arvidsson U. Riedl M. Chakrabarti S. Lee J.H. Nakano A.H. Dado R.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Wessendorf M.W. Elde R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3328-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The incorporation of [32Pi] into the immunoprecipitated epitope-tagged μ-opioid receptor in the presence of DAMGO was dramatically increased compared with the basal control level. This increase in the phosphorylation can be demonstrated to be associated with the μ-opioid receptor from the following observations: (a) the antagonist naloxone can completely block the DAMGO-induced increase in phosphorylation (Fig. 2,third lane), and (b) in the untransfected neuro2A control cells, no phosphoprotein with these molecular weights was immunoprecipitated from cells treated with DAMGO for the same period of time (Fig. 2, fourth lane). DAMGO-induced μ-opioid receptor phosphorylation was rapid, occurring within the first few minutes of agonist addition and reaching a maximum within 20 min of DAMGO exposure (Fig. 3,A and B). The low levels of basal receptor phosphorylation in the control (without agonist treatment) were dramatically increased when the cells were treated with 5 μm DAMGO for 20 min. A similar level of increase was observed when the HEKMT cells were treated with DAMGO for 30 min (Fig.3 C). The amount of phosphorylated receptor stayed at the maximum level during the first hour of DAMGO treatment. During this time period, the DAMGO-induced phosphorylation was concentration-dependent (Fig.4). After 30 min of cell exposure to 100 nm DAMGO, there was a detectable increase in phosphorylation. This increase reached a plateau at 3 μm, giving an EC50 of 450 ± 120 nm (Fig.4 B). The EC50 value for DAMGO to induce 50% of maximal phosphorylated μ-opioid receptor was markedly higher than the 3.1 ± 0.9 nm required to elicit 50% of maximal adenylyl cyclase inhibition, under identical conditions.Figure 4MOR1TAG phosphorylation is agonist concentration dependent, reaching a plateau at 3 μm with an EC50 of 450 nm. A, MOR1TAGID2 cells were radiolabeled and treated for 30 min with increasing concentrations of DAMGO.Lanes 1–8 correspond to 1, 10, 100, 300, 1,000, 3,000, 10,000, and 30,000 nm, DAMGO, respectively.

At sediment sites, observed weak-motion amplifications from magnitude 3 to 4 aftershocks of the 1994 Northridge earthquake were twice as large as magnitude 6.7 mainshock amplifications. Amplitude-dependent (nonlinear) amplification by sediment is one explanation. However, earthquake simulations with empirical impulse responses and elastic finite-difference calculations with weakly heterogeneous, random three-dimensional (3D) crustal velocity variations show that linear wave propagation can explain observed (apparently nonlinear) sediment responses. Random 3D velocity variations also reproduce the observed log-normal dispersion of peak ground motions. Deterministic wave propagation models are not adequate to quantify the scaling and dispersion of near-source ground motions."
https://openalex.org/W2062665198,Polarization of the optical emission from GRB 990123 was measured on 24.17 January 1999 universal time with the Nordic Optical Telescope. An upper limit of 2.3% on the linear polarization was found. Accurate polarization measurements provide important clues to the blast wave geometry and magnetic field structure of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The lack of detectable polarization for GRB 990123 indicates that the optical afterglow was produced by a blast wave of unknown geometry with an insignificant coherent magnetic field or by a beamed outflow at high Lorentz factor seen at a small viewing angle. Such a collimated jet would help solve the problem of energy release in this exceptionally luminous cosmological burst.
https://openalex.org/W2126299814,"An optical spectrum of the afterglow from the unusually bright gamma-ray burst GRB 990123 obtained on 24.25 January 1999 universal time showed an absorption system at a redshift of z = 1.600. The absence of a hydrogen Lyman α forest sets an upper limit of z &lt; 2.17, whereas ultraviolet photometry indicates an upper limit of z &lt; 2.05. The probability of intersecting an absorption system as strong as the one observed along a random line of sight out to this z is at most a few percent, implying that GRB 990123 was probably at z = 1.600. Currently favored cosmological parameters imply that an isotropic energy release equivalent to the rest mass of 1.8 neutron stars (4.5 × 10 54 erg) was emitted in gamma rays. Nonisotropic emission, such as intrinsic beaming, may resolve this energy problem."

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). Type 1B topoisomerases act (Fig.1) by first binding double-stranded DNA and then cleaving substrate DNA using a conserved enzyme tyrosine residue, forming a 3′-O-phosphotyrosine linkage. The DNA strands then isomerize, either by passing one strand through the break in the other or by rotation of the covalent complex, relaxing the DNA. The broken strand is then resealed by nucleophillic attack of the 5′-hydroxyl on the phosphotyrosine bond.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–80) contacts the 5′-(T/C)CCTT-3′ element on the major groove side of the DNA (15Sharma A.

Chemical footprinting and interference studies indicate that the enzyme contacts several phosphates, including the scissile phosphate, on both strands and the minor groove side as well. Recently, the crystal structure of the C-terminal catalytic domain of vaccinia topoisomerase (amino acids 81–314) was determined and found to be a member of the λ-integrase family (18Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The topoisomerase of MCV1 is 54% identical to that of vaccinia and presumably resembles the vaccinia enzyme closely in structure and mechanism.Here we present a study of the role of DNA sequence in the function of MCV topoisomerase. Poxvirus topoisomerases are experimentally tractable due to their small size (33 kDa) and function as monomers (19Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The high degree of sequence specificity allows the enzyme to be placed precisely on test DNA substrates for analysis. In addition, MCV causes medically important opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients (20Petersen C.S. Gerstoft J. Dermatology. 1992; 184: 19-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Gottlieb S.L. Myskowski P.L. Int. J. Dermatol. 1994; 33: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Schwartz J.J.

Dermatol. 1992; 27: 583-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), adding interest to understanding the mechanism in the hope of aiding the development of antiviral agents. We investigated DNA contacts important in different parts of the topoisomerase catalytic cycle. We found that previously unidentified DNA contacts increase the rate of a limiting step between initial binding and covalent bond formation.DISCUSSIONOur studies indicated that MCV topoisomerase recognizes a larger site than the previously described 5′-(C/T)CCTT-3′ motif. Sequence contacts to the major groove outside the conserved pentamer were found to be selectively important for catalysis in the noncovalent protein-DNA complex. These data emphasize the importance of a reaction step between initial binding and covalent complex formation, a point also raised in structural studies of type 1B topoisomerases and related enzymes (26Stewart L.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1796-1803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the enzyme bound to a recognition site spanning roughly 20 base pairs centered on the 5′-(C/T)CCTT-3′ motif. The additional base pairs identified as important here, at +10, −2, and −3, are within the region bound on the cleaved strand, but the +10-position may not be contacted on the uncleaved strand. This differed slightly from results with vaccinia, in which the footprint was larger on the uncleaved strand for the same substrate, indicating possible subtle differences in the complexes. Previously, vaccinia topoisomerase substrates were found to have differential impairments in catalysis and binding, but the locations of base pairs important for each were not clarified. Data presented here for MCV represent the first elucidation of important sequences outside of the 5′-(C/T)CCTT-3′ motif and their role in postbinding activation of catalysis.The vaccinia virus topoisomerase catalytic domain (residues 81–314) has been visualized by x-ray crystallography, and a model of the DNA complex has been built that satisfies several biochemical and structural constraints (18Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In this model, the catalytic domain spans positions +10 to −9 with respect to the scissile phosphate, with varying degrees of engagement of the DNA in this region. The amino-terminal domain binds the conserved 5′-(C/T)CCTT-3′ motif in the major groove. The catalytic domain lies on the other side of the DNA near the scissile phosphate (Fig. 5). Although the structure of the MCV topoisomerase has not been studied by x-ray crystallography, the high degree of sequence identity between the enzymes (54%) and functional similarity described here suggests that the vaccinia model probably describes MCV in some detail.Figure 5Model of DNA contacts inferred to be important for covalent complex formation following initial binding.

In the structure of the catalytic domain of vaccinia virus topoisomerase, solved in the absence of DNA substrate, the tyrosine residue that acts as the nucleophile in forming the covalent intermediate was not correctly positioned to attack the scissile phosphate. A conformational change is thus necessary to activate the enzyme for covalent complex formation (18Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Mutational studies have also supported a model in which a postbinding isomerization takes place prior to covalent complex formation (31Cheng C. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11589-11595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Structural studies and sequence alignments indicate that the eukaryotic type 1B topoisomerases are members of the larger family of λ-integrase-related proteins. Several λ-integrase family protein structures, solved in the absence of DNA, also contain active site tyrosines in what appear to be inactive conformations. In XerD, the active site residues are apparently buried in the protein interior (28Subramanya H.S. Arciszewska L.K. Baker R.A. Bird L.E. Sherratt D.J. Wigley D.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), while in the λ-integrase catalytic domain, the active site tyrosine is part of a disordered loop (30Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R. Landy A. Ellenberger T. Science. 1997; 276: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For human type 1B topoisomerase, comparison of structures of catalytic domain fragments in both covalent and noncovalent complexes reveal clear although modest rearrangements of active site residues (26Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 179: 1534-1541Crossref Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 27Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar).In the case of the phage P1 Cre protein, a site-specific recombinase of the λ-integrase family, an x-ray structure is available of a recombination intermediate in which two of four Cre monomers have formed covalent complexes (29Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 398: 40-46Crossref Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In these structures, the positions of the active site tyrosines differ substantially, with the tyrosine in the two noncovalently bound complexes moved away from the scissile phosphate by a conformational change. Evidently, conformational transitions following the first pair of strand exchanges bring the second pair of active site tyrosines into alignment at the proper time for catalysis. These findings taken together emphasize the ubiquity of postbinding conformational changes and the potential of this step as a regulatory input.DNA Binding and Catalysis by Poxvirus TopoisomerasesIn our study of catalysis by MCV topoisomerase, an intermediate step between DNA binding and covalent complex formation appears to be rate-limiting, at least for some substrates. Correct DNA contacts may increase the rate of this intermediate step, potentially involving changes that bring the active site tyrosine into proper position. We hypothesize that the noncovalent complexes formed by MCV topoisomerase on poor substrates such as substrate y mimic the normal noncovalent intermediate. According to this view, the suboptimal base pairs at +10, −2, and −3 obstruct the postbinding conformational change. Conversely, correct engagement of the key flanking sequences may help the catalytic domain to adopt the active conformation. In support of this model, we demonstrated using 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate substrates that the step activated by optimal flanking sequences was initial cleavage after DNA binding.The activating contacts are probably made at least in part by the catalytic domain. Studies of inosine substitutions specify the side of the helix toward the catalytic domain as the probable region contacted (Fig. 5). Furthermore, a catalytic domain fragment of MCV topoisomerase is sensitive to base sequence +10, −2, and −3, supporting this aspect of the model. 3Y. Hwang, A. Burgin Jr., and F. Bushman, unpublished data. In the model of the vaccinia catalytic domain structure docked on straight B-DNA (18Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), these flanking sequences may not be extensively engaged, indicating that the protein or DNA may need to bend to make these contacts (Fig. 5). A previous study of the vaccinia topoisomerase emphasized the role of the amino-terminal and linker domains in activating catalysis (18Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, in any model, conformational changes must ultimately position the active site tyrosine for cleavage, implying that changes must propagate to the catalytic domain as suggested here. Topoisomerases play important roles in DNA replication, recombination, and transcription (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). Type 1B topoisomerases act (Fig.1) by first binding double-stranded DNA and then cleaving substrate DNA using a conserved enzyme tyrosine residue, forming a 3′-O-phosphotyrosine linkage. The DNA strands then isomerize, either by passing one strand through the break in the other or by rotation of the covalent complex, relaxing the DNA. The broken strand is then resealed by nucleophillic attack of the 5′-hydroxyl on the phosphotyrosine bond. Last, the topoisomerase dissociates from substrate. All the poxviruses studied to date encode a type 1B topoisomerase (2Klemperer N. Lyttle D.J. Tauzin D. Traktman P. Robinson A.J.

Poxvirus topoisomerases bind to the sequence 5′-(T/C)CCTT-3′ and cleave just 3′ of the last T (designated position +1), to form the covalent intermediate (7Hwang Y. Wang B. Bushman F.D. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 10110-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the high degree of specificity seen with the poxvirus topoisomerases is unique. In the case of vaccinia virus, the most thoroughly studied model, the topoisomerase enzyme consists of two domains linked through a trypsin-sensitive bridge (15Sharma A. Hanai R. Mondragon A. Structure. 1994; 2: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–80) contacts the 5′-(T/C)CCTT-3′ element on the major groove side of the DNA (15Sharma A. Hanai R. Mondragon A. Structure. 1994; 2: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Sekiguchi J. Shuman S.

Chemical footprinting and interference studies indicate that the enzyme contacts several phosphates, including the scissile phosphate, on both strands and the minor groove side as well. Recently, the crystal structure of the C-terminal catalytic domain of vaccinia topoisomerase (amino acids 81–314) was determined and found to be a member of the λ-integrase family (18Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The topoisomerase of MCV1 is 54% identical to that of vaccinia and presumably resembles the vaccinia enzyme closely in structure and mechanism. Here we present a study of the role of DNA sequence in the function of MCV topoisomerase. Poxvirus topoisomerases are experimentally tractable due to their small size (33 kDa) and function as monomers (19Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The high degree of sequence specificity allows the enzyme to be placed precisely on test DNA substrates for analysis. In addition, MCV causes medically important opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients (20Petersen C.S. Gerstoft J. Dermatology. 1992; 184: 19-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Gottlieb S.L. Myskowski P.L. Int. J. Dermatol. 1994; 33: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Schwartz J.J. Myskowski P.L. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1992; 27: 583-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), adding interest to understanding the mechanism in the hope of aiding the development of antiviral agents. We investigated DNA contacts important in different parts of the topoisomerase catalytic cycle. We found that previously unidentified DNA contacts increase the rate of a limiting step between initial binding and covalent bond formation. DISCUSSIONOur studies indicated that MCV topoisomerase recognizes a larger site than the previously described 5′-(C/T)CCTT-3′ motif. Sequence contacts to the major groove outside the conserved pentamer were found to be selectively important for catalysis in the noncovalent protein-DNA complex. These data emphasize the importance of a reaction step between initial binding and covalent complex formation, a point also raised in structural studies of type 1B topoisomerases and related enzymes (26Stewart L.

Science. 1997; 276: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).DNA Binding by Poxvirus TopoisomerasesDNase I footprinting studies of MCV topoisomerase and vaccinia topoisomerase (9Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1796-1803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the enzyme bound to a recognition site spanning roughly 20 base pairs centered on the 5′-(C/T)CCTT-3′ motif. The additional base pairs identified as important here, at +10, −2, and −3, are within the region bound on the cleaved strand, but the +10-position may not be contacted on the uncleaved strand. This differed slightly from results with vaccinia, in which the footprint was larger on the uncleaved strand for the same substrate, indicating possible subtle differences in the complexes. Previously, vaccinia topoisomerase substrates were found to have differential impairments in catalysis and binding, but the locations of base pairs important for each were not clarified. Data presented here for MCV represent the first elucidation of important sequences outside of the 5′-(C/T)CCTT-3′ motif and their role in postbinding activation of catalysis.The vaccinia virus topoisomerase catalytic domain (residues 81–314) has been visualized by x-ray crystallography, and a model of the DNA complex has been built that satisfies several biochemical and structural constraints (18Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In this model, the catalytic domain spans positions +10 to −9 with respect to the scissile phosphate, with varying degrees of engagement of the DNA in this region. The amino-terminal domain binds the conserved 5′-(C/T)CCTT-3′ motif in the major groove. The catalytic domain lies on the other side of the DNA near the scissile phosphate (Fig. 5). Although the structure of the MCV topoisomerase has not been studied by x-ray crystallography, the high degree of sequence identity between the enzymes (54%) and functional similarity described here suggests that the vaccinia model probably describes MCV in some detail.Postbinding Steps Potentiating Catalysis by Type 1B Topoisomerases and Related EnzymesVaccinia virus topoisomerase and several related proteins have been proposed to require a protein conformational change to potentiate covalent complex formation. In the structure of the catalytic domain of vaccinia virus topoisomerase, solved in the absence of DNA substrate, the tyrosine residue that acts as the nucleophile in forming the covalent intermediate was not correctly positioned to attack the scissile phosphate. A conformational change is thus necessary to activate the enzyme for covalent complex formation (18Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Mutational studies have also supported a model in which a postbinding isomerization takes place prior to covalent complex formation (31Cheng C. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11589-11595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Structural studies and sequence alignments indicate that the eukaryotic type 1B topoisomerases are members of the larger family of λ-integrase-related proteins. Several λ-integrase family protein structures, solved in the absence of DNA, also contain active site tyrosines in what appear to be inactive conformations. In XerD, the active site residues are apparently buried in the protein interior (28Subramanya H.S. Arciszewska L.K. Baker R.A. Bird L.E. Sherratt D.J. Wigley D.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), while in the λ-integrase catalytic domain, the active site tyrosine is part of a disordered loop (30Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R. Landy A. Ellenberger T. Science. 1997; 276: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For human type 1B topoisomerase, comparison of structures of catalytic domain fragments in both covalent and noncovalent complexes reveal clear although modest rearrangements of active site residues (26Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 179: 1534-1541Crossref Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 27Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar).In the case of the phage P1 Cre protein, a site-specific recombinase of the λ-integrase family, an x-ray structure is available of a recombination intermediate in which two of four Cre monomers have formed covalent complexes (29Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 398: 40-46Crossref Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In these structures, the positions of the active site tyrosines differ substantially, with the tyrosine in the two noncovalently bound complexes moved away from the scissile phosphate by a conformational change. Evidently, conformational transitions following the first pair of strand exchanges bring the second pair of active site tyrosines into alignment at the proper time for catalysis. These findings taken together emphasize the ubiquity of postbinding conformational changes and the potential of this step as a regulatory input.DNA Binding and Catalysis by Poxvirus TopoisomerasesIn our study of catalysis by MCV topoisomerase, an intermediate step between DNA binding and covalent complex formation appears to be rate-limiting, at least for some substrates. Correct DNA contacts may increase the rate of this intermediate step, potentially involving changes that bring the active site tyrosine into proper position. We hypothesize that the noncovalent complexes formed by MCV topoisomerase on poor substrates such as substrate y mimic the normal noncovale"
https://openalex.org/W2010181831,"The physical state of two model mutants of α-hemolysin (αHL), αHL(1–289), a carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant (CDM), and αHL(1–331), a carboxyl-terminal extension mutant (CEM), were examined in detail to identify the role of the carboxyl terminus in the folding and function of native αHL. Denatured αHL can be refolded efficiently with nearly total recovery of its activity upon restoration of nondenaturing conditions. Various biophysical and biochemical studies on the three proteins have revealed the importance of an intact carboxyl terminus in the folding of αHL. The CDM exhibits a marked increase in susceptibility to proteases as compared with αHL. αHL and CEM exhibit similar fluorescence emission maxima, and that of the CDM is red-shifted by 9 nm, which indicates a greater solvent exposure of the tryptophan residues of the CDM. In addition, the CDM binds 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) and increases its fluorescence intensity significantly unlike αHL and CEM, which show marginal binding. The circular dichroism studies point that the CDM possesses significant secondary structure, but its tertiary structure is greatly diminished as compared with αHL. These data show that the CDM has several of the features that characterize a molten globule state. Experiments with freshly translated mutants, using coupled in vitro transcription and translation, have further supported our observations that deletion at the carboxyl terminus leads to major structural perturbations in the water-soluble form of αHL.

Walker B. Cheley S. Kasianowicz J.J. Song L. Gouaux J.E. Bayley H. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). It is a 293-amino acid polypeptide that binds target cells as a monomer, and the cell-bound monomers undergo lateral diffusion to form a transmembrane heptameric pore. The heptamer is a rigid mushroom-like structure, resistant to SDS and temperatures up to 80 °C (2Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). The water-soluble monomer undergoes a series of conformational changes to form the heptameric pore on the membrane. The amino acid residues 110–148, termed the stem domain, penetrate the membrane bilayer to access the interior of a target cell for the functional pore formation. The activity of αHL was earlier shown to be critically dependent on an intact amino and carboxyl termini (3Walker B.J. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that deletion of four amino acids at the amino terminus of αHL leads to delayed pore opening. Although this mutant (αHL(5–293)) could undergo the oligomerization process as fast as native αHL, the conformational changes that lead to the opening of the pore were retarded (4Vandana S. Manoj R. Krishnasastry M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopic studies carried out by Valeva et al. (5Valeva A. Pongs J. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have also arrived at similar conclusions regarding the role of the amino terminus. Previous studies have shown that deletion of three, five, or eight amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal end of αHL impairs its oligomerization and pore formation abilities. The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants, however, have been shown to bind to rabbit red blood cells (rRBCs), where they remain in a cell-bound monomer form (3Walker B.J. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants are very inefficient in forming hetrooligomers with full-length αHL. All of the studies conducted so far have attributed the role of the amino terminus for pore opening and the carboxyl terminus for the initial oligomerization process of αHL. However, the reasons for the inefficient oligomerization of the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants are not yet clear. It has been observed that the carboxyl-terminal end of αHL becomes more exposed to the solvent in the oligomeric state than in the monomer form in solution, as revealed by IASD modification of single cysteine mutants (IASD is a membrane-impermeant reagent that covalently modifies surface-accessible cysteine residues in proteins (6Krishnasastry M.V. Walker B. Braha O. Bayley H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Walker B. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23065-23071Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). This observation was supported by the crystal structure of the fully assembled αHL pore, which shows that the carboxyl terminus is well exposed to solvent. Thus, the carboxyl terminus does not appear to be critically involved in interprotomer interactions (3Walker B.J. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, a deletion of as few as three carboxyl-terminal residues ought not to have any drastic effect on the oligomerization process. Another possibility is that the carboxyl-terminal deletion is hampering a process prior to the oligomerization step, which might occur in the water-soluble monomer or at the membrane-bound monomer stage. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding of the role of the carboxyl terminus in the structure and function of αHL, we have aimed to examine the properties of a carboxyl-terminal deletion and an extension mutant. The extension mutant was constructed with an aim to see whether or not αHL can accept a polypeptide at the carboxyl terminus and still carry out its folding and function. For this purpose, we have added a nearly neutral, nonaromatic amino acid-rich sequence to the carboxyl terminus of αHL. In this paper, the results from biochemical and biophysical studies on the above proteins have revealed that the carboxyl terminus of αHL stabilizes the native structure of αHL. In the absence of the carboxyl terminus, αHL is unable to acquire its water-soluble, fully folded, native form. This defective folding caused by truncation is responsible for the loss of function of αHL. All bacterial strains employed in this study were obtained from commercial sources. Ultrapure bovine serum albumin, S-Sepharose, and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonate (ANS) were obtained from Sigma. Protein estimations were carried out with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) using ultrapure lipid-free bovine serum albumin as the standard. Hemolysis assays were carried out with freshly drawn blood from New Zealand White rabbits of the local animal facility. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. The cloning of αHL was described in detail by Vandana et al. (4Vandana S. Manoj R. Krishnasastry M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The PCR amplification of CDM was achieved by advancing the stop codon present in αHL at 294 to Glu290 by a downstream primer that contains a HindIII site. (The upstream primer is the same as that used for αHL.) The resultant PCR product was digested withNcoI and HindIII and ligated to the pT7 vector described earlier (4Vandana S. Manoj R. Krishnasastry M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The CEM was constructed in two stages by PCR amplification of the αHL gene using an upstream primer that contains an EcoRI site at Asn293 and the downstream primer (with HindIII site) of αHL reported earlier (4Vandana S. Manoj R. Krishnasastry M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The upstream primer eliminates the stop codon present in the αHL gene. The primers containing the EcoRI andHindIII sites were first joined by PCR using αHL template. The CEM in final form was obtained by re-PCR of αHL template using a T7 promoter primer and the EcoRI and HindIII joined product obtained in the first stage. The resultant PCR product was digested with NcoI and EcoRI to remove the 3′-untranslated region of αHL. This double-digested PCR product was ligated to the parent pT7 vector between NcoI andEcoRI. As a result of removal of the stop codon of αHL, the translation proceeds beyond the EcoRI site and incorporates the following 38-amino acid stretch from the vector backbone:294SSSVDKLEYSIVSPKSELDPAANKARKEAELAAATAEQ331. αHL was purified from S. aureus wood 46 (ATCC 10832) as reported earlier (8Lind I. Ahnert-Hilger G. Fuchs G. Gratzl M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2% mid-log phase inoculum of S. aureus was added to 1 liter of tryptic soy broth, and the culture was grown for 18 h at 37 °C. The cells were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was brought to 80% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The mixture was left overnight at 4 °C with mild stirring. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dialyzed against 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.2, buffer at 4 °C for 48 h with at least eight changes. The dialysate was clarified and loaded on an S-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2. The bound αHL was eluted with a step gradient, and the yield of αHL was typically 3–4 mg/liter. The protein was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (9Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the CDM plasmid were grown at 37 °C and induced at 0.4A 600 with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4 h of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 ×g for 20 min, resuspended in buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA), and treated with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme at 20 °C for 25 min. The cells were passed once at 1000 p.s.i. through a French press followed by 5-min sonication. The resultant cell lysate was centrifuged at 6000 ×g for 10 min. The inclusion body pellet was washed three times with 1 m urea and 0.5% Triton X-100 in buffer A, rinsed with buffer A, and stored at −4 °C until further use. The inclusion bodies were suspended in 8 m urea in buffer B (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2), diluted 2-fold with buffer B, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g. The supernatant was passed through an S-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with 4m urea in buffer B. The mutant protein eluted with 200 mm NaCl and 4 m urea in buffer B. The protein was renatured either by dialysis against buffer B at 4 °C or by simple dilution as desired for specific experiments, and hereafter this protein is referred to as renatured. The renatured protein was found to be >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. Purification of the soluble protein was carried out employing similar protocol reported by us earlier for αHL(5–293) (4Vandana S. Manoj R. Krishnasastry M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The proteins (native and refolded as applicable) were subjected to digestion with Proteinase K at 25 °C by keeping the substrate:enzyme ratio at 50:1. At appropriate time points, the enzyme was inactivated by the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by 14% SDS-PAGE. The lysis of rRBCs was measured by adding 100 μl (7 μg/ml) of protein to 100 μl of K-PBSA (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in well number 1, and a 100-μl aliquot was taken for 2-fold serial dilution to 12 wells. An equal volume of 2% rRBCs was added to the wells and left at 25 °C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation period, the well number exhibiting 50% lysis was recorded visually. For CDM, the lysis was recorded after 24 h. Unless specifically mentioned, all hemolytic assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. The toxins (2 μg) were added to 1 ml of K-PBSA and a 500-μl aliquot was subjected to 2-fold serial dilutions with the same buffer. To the serially diluted samples an equal volume (500 μl) of 1% rRBCs was added and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The samples were then centrifuged, and the absorbance at 545 nm (due to hemoglobin release) was plotted against toxin concentration. For the mixed hemolysis assays with αHL and CEM, known quantities of toxins were mixed, and the assay was carried out as outlined above. A stock solution of αHL (1.75 mg/ml) was diluted with freshly prepared 10 m urea or 8 m guanidine HCl to a final concentration of 0.350 mg/ml αHL in 8 m urea and 6 m guanidine HCl, respectively. For acid denaturation studies, αHL was incubated in 50 mm citrate-phosphate buffer at pH 2.5, 3.5, and 7.0 at a concentration of 350 μg/ml. After incubation at 25 °C for different periods of time in the above described conditions, samples were withdrawn and diluted 50 times with various buffers (given in Tables I and II), and a hemolysis assay was performed immediately.Table IRecovery of hemolytic activity of αHL after its denaturation and renaturationDenaturing agentBuffer used for renaturationaBuffers are as follows: A, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2; B, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; and C, 50 mm citrate-phosphate, pH 7.0.Time period of incubation in denaturant before renaturationbThe numbers shown are the well number exhibiting 50% lysis of rRBCs in a 96-well plate.2 min15 min30 min60 minNative control (no denaturant)A, B, C66668m ureaA, B66666 mguanidine HClA, B6666Low pH50 mm citrate-phosphate, pH 3.5C653250 mm citrate-phosphate, pH 2.5C6665The data were obtained from an average of 10 independent assays.a Buffers are as follows: A, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2; B, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; and C, 50 mm citrate-phosphate, pH 7.0.b The numbers shown are the well number exhibiting 50% lysis of rRBCs in a 96-well plate.

Fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorometer. The protein samples (30 μg/ml in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) were excited at 295 nm, and the slit widths were 5 nm for both excitation and emission. All fluorescence spectra are corrected for buffer contribution and are an average of at least eight scans. For the pH-induced unfolding studies, αHL and CDM were incubated in 50 mm citric acid/Na2HPO4 buffer of pH values ranging from 2.5 to 7.0 for 20 min before measuring the emission spectrum. The buffer solutions were prepared by suitably mixing solutions of 50 mm citric acid and 50 mmNa2HPO4 in order to obtain the desired pH. For ANS binding studies, a stock solution of ANS (5 mm) was prepared in methanol. Binding of ANS to αHL, CDM, and CEM was carried out in cuvettes containing 30 μg/ml protein in 10 mmMOPS, pH 7.00, and 50 μm ANS. ANS fluorescence was obtained in the range of 410–580 nm with the excitation wavelength fixed at 390 nm using the same slit widths mentioned above. CD spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon spectropolarimeter, which was calibrated withd-10-camphorsulfonic acid. The proteins were diluted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, buffer. The far (190–250 nm) and near (250–320 nm) UV spectra were recorded in 1-mm and 5-cm path length quartz cuvettes, respectively. The spectra are an average of four scans, with subtraction of appropriate blanks. Supercoiled plasmid DNA was used for in vitro transcription and translation in an Escherichia coli T7-S30 extract in the presence of rifampicin and complete amino acid mix as reported earlier (4Vandana S. Manoj R. Krishnasastry M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A 5-μl aliquot was withdrawn at various time intervals from the initiation of translation. The 5-μl aliquot was added to a 96-well plate containing 200 μl of 0.5% rRBCs. The decrease in absorbance at 595 nm due to hemolysis was monitored at regular time intervals. All of the toxins employed for the present study were constructed under the control of the T7 promoter. The relative sizes of the polypeptides are in agreement with the cloning strategy (Fig.1 A). Unlike recombinant αHL and CEM, the soluble form of CDM could not be obtained due to extensive inclusion body formation (>95%). Since inclusion body formation is often due to temperature-sensitive denaturation of the protein and can be avoided at lower culture growth temperatures (10Schein C.H. Noteborn M.H.M. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 291-294Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar), the CDM culture was grown at 30 °C. However, this had no effect on the extent of inclusion body formation. Hence, we have purified CDM by solubilizing its inclusion bodies as described under “Materials and Methods.” The purity of all three proteins was routinely assessed by SDS-PAGE and was found to be >98% as shown in Fig. 1 A. We have carried out limited proteolysis of the three proteins in solution with Proteinase K. Limited proteolysis is a sensitive probe for analyzing the conformation of proteins (11Fontana A. de Laureto P.P. De Filippis V. Scaramella E. Zambonin M. Folding Design. 1997; 2: R17-R26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Polypeptides that are devoid of tertiary structure have been observed to be very sensitive to proteolysis (12Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Cell. 1986; 46: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 13Merrill A.R. Cohen F.S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5829-5836Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Proteinase K cleaves αHL monomer in solution between residues 131 and 136 of the polypeptide chain, yielding an approximate two halves of αHL. Such a cleavage does not occur for the membrane-bound forms of monomer and oligomer because these residues get occluded in the membrane (14Tobkes N. Wallace B.A. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1 B, the refolded CDM was completely digested by Proteinase K in minutes, whereas αHL gave the expected two halves, which were resistant toward further protease attack. This enhanced susceptibility of CDM towards protease suggests that its structure is not as rigid as that of αHL. The hemolytic activity of the three proteins was compared by a quantitative assay. As seen from Fig.2, the CDM exhibited no lysis at all in the time course of the experiment, whereas the CEM showed efficient lysis. However, it is about 5-fold weaker than αHL and increasing the amount of CEM 5 times in the assay gave an identical curve like that of αHL. The denaturation and renaturation of αHL were carried out by employing a wide spectrum of denaturing conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” It is clear from Table I that >95% of hemolytic activity of αHL can be recovered upon restoration of nondenaturing conditions. However, when αHL was incubated at pH 3.5 at room temperature, the recovery of hemolytic activity decreases with longer incubation times. At pH 3.5, the carboxyl-terminal portion of αHL is said to undergo a transition to a molten globule-like state with exposed hydrophobic regions (15Semjen B.V. Mollby R. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8655-8660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The apparent reason for the loss of activity at pH 3.5 could be due to aggregation of the partially unfolded intermediate. However, total recovery of activity was achieved when the incubation was carried out at 4 °C, which could be either due to slow denaturation or due to a significant decrease in hydrophobic interactions at the lower temperature. The normalized fluorescence emission spectra of native and denatured states of αHL, CDM, and CEM are shown in Fig. 3, and the emission maxima obtained are 336, 345, and 336 nm, respectively. It is interesting to note that the emission maximum of CDM exhibited a 9-nm red shift with respect to native αHL, indicating a change in the polarity of environment of tryptophans due to solvent exposure (16Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 251-286Google Scholar). The emission maxima for all three toxins were further red-shifted in presence of 8m urea to 352.5 nm. In contrast to CDM, the fluorescence spectrum of CEM was identical to that of αHL, indicating that the extra 38 residues at the C-terminal end of αHL did not have any influence on its folding and function. The residues that were deleted in the case of CDM are Glu290-Met291-Thr292-Asn293, and the residues extended in the case of CEM do not contain any tryptophans. Hence, αHL, CDM, and CEM contain an equal number of aromatic residues in their primary sequence, and the differences in their fluorescence spectra clearly reflect the degree of compactness of the individual toxins. The fluorescence emission maximum as a function of pH for αHL and CDM is depicted in Fig. 4. The curve obtained for αHL is in agreement with previous results (15Semjen B.V. Mollby R. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8655-8660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The CDM in 8m urea was either 1) diluted with an appropriate buffer to the desired pH (final urea concentration was kept at about 80 mm) or 2) renatured by dialysis, and the pH of the dialysate was adjusted to the desired value. The curves obtained by both of the approaches do not overlap (as one would expect) even after incubation for 48 h, in that the case 2 CDM appears to be more resistant to acid denaturation compared with the case 1 CDM. This hysteresis could be due to formation of soluble aggregates among the renatured CDM molecules, because it has been observed that aggregation commonly interferes with the correct equilibrium, giving rise to such hysteresis (17Jaenicke R. Seckler R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 1-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This possibility was examined by glutaraldehyde cross-linking of the renatured CDM, and high molecular weight forms of CDM were observed in contrast to αHL (data not shown). ANS has been extensively used to characterize the hydrophobic pockets of proteins and enzymes for understanding their folding and function (18Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission of ANS is known to increase when the dye binds to hydrophobic regions of proteins that are normally absent in totally unfolded states and rarely present in native states (19Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). While the fluorescence of ANS marginally increased in the presence of αHL and CEM, the increase in case of CDM was rather dramatic, as shown in Fig. 5. In addition, the emission maximum of ANS had blue-shifted from 513 nm in buffer to 483.5 nm upon binding to CDM. On the other hand, the denatured states of the three proteins did not bind any ANS (data not shown). This result indicates that CDM has hydrophobic regions exposed to the solvent, unlike αHL and CEM. It is interesting to note that the CEM did not show any concomitant increase in fluorescence intensity of ANS. These observations reflect the compactness of native αHL and the role of the carboxyl terminus in maintaining such a compact structure. The secondary structure of αHL and CDM was examined by far UV-CD spectroscopy. The CD spectrum of CDM shows a significant content of secondary structure and is characteristic of a predominantly β-sheet protein, as is the case for αHL. However, comparison with the αHL spectrum suggests some minor conformational differences between the two species (Fig.6 A). The spectrum of αHL shows a minimum at 214.5 nm and is consistent with earlier reports (14Tobkes N. Wallace B.A. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,15Semjen B.V. Mollby R. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8655-8660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Igikai H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In case of CDM, the minimum was red-shifted to 218.5 nm. This might result from a change in the polarity of the environment of β-sheets, since it is well known that the β-sheet is very sensitive to a change in environment conditions (21Wallace B.A. Kohl N. Teeter M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The near UV-CD spectra of αHL and CDM are shown in Fig.6 B. The αHL spectrum is consistent with the previously published reports. Comparison of the two spectra shows a drastic difference in the tertiary structure of the two proteins. In case of CDM, the negative peaks at 265 and 295 nm, which correspond to the vibrionic regions of phenylalanine and tryptophan, respectively (22Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 161-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), are totally absent. This indicates that most of the phenylalanine and tryptophan are in a more mobile environment. However, CDM still possesses the positive peak at 280 nm, whose ellipticity is about 30% of the corresponding peak in the αHL spectrum. This reveals that some rigid tertiary contacts are present in CDM, particularly around a fraction of the tyrosine residues, but the overall spectrum reflects a significant disorder in the tertiary structure of CDM. In the present study, we have designed a carboxyl-terminal deletion and a carboxyl-terminal extension mutant of αHL in order to investigate the contribution of the carboxyl-terminal residues of the protein to its structural organization and function. Our efforts to isolate the CDM have met with partial success, since it appears to be unstable. The protein is almost exclusively found in inclusion bodies, unlike recombinant αHL and CEM, which can be isolated in soluble, active form. A variety of attempts to purify the CDM by ion exchange and gel filtration techniques have led to precipitation of the protein in the column. Hence, a wide spectrum of conditions was employed in an attempt to stabilize the CDM, and the conditions suitable for spectroscopic studies are low ionic strength and pH 5.0–7.0. The CEM, on the other hand, can be purified like αHL. The hemolytic data presented in Table I show that αHL can be unfolded and refolded to its native form in a variety of conditions. Refolding is extremely efficient, with almost total recovery of activity. Hemolysis studies carried out with the mutants showed that the CDM is very weakly lytic, which is in agreement with prior studies with other C-terminal deletion mutants (3Walker B.J. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the CEM, which has 38 extra amino acids, was able to lyse the rRBCs efficiently (Fig. 2). The CDM has a tendency to aggregate both in vitro andin vivo (as seen by the extensive inclusion body formation). Studies have shown that inclusion bodies form due to aggregation of partially folded intermediates (23Oberg K. Chrunyk B.A. Wetzel R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2628-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Hence, the occurrence of CDM in inclusion bodies suggests that the mutant protein was unable to achieve the final folded conformation in vivo. Limited proteolysis experiments have revealed that the CDM gets completely digested unlike αHL, which exhibited its typical “two halves” pattern. This pronounced susceptibility of CDM to proteolytic digestion suggests a more relaxed structure in which many proteolytic sites that are otherwise hidden in αHL are getting exposed. All these observations suggest that the CDM possesses a non-αHL like structure. The fluorescence emission of the CDM lies in between the native and denatured states of αHL. This red shift observed for the CDM indicates that its tryptophan residues are more exposed to the solvent as compared with αHL. This was further corroborated with binding studies with ANS, a dye widely used to probe the molten globule states of proteins. The fluorescence intensity of ANS increased by about 10-fold upon binding to CDM but showed negligible increase in the presence of αHL and the denatured states of the two proteins. The increase is accompanied by a blue shift of the emission maximum by 29.5 nm, which is an indication of specific binding. These results indicate the presence of exposed hydrophobic regions in CDM, which are sequestered in native αHL. The far UV-CD spectrum of CDM shows that it possesses nearly native-like secondary structure. However, its tertiary structure as analyzed by near UV-CD is greatly diminished. The near UV-CD spectrum indicates that most of the phenylalanine and tryptophan of CDM are in a mobile, symmetric environment but some tertiary contacts are present in the environment of some of the tyrosines. A cursory glance at the distribution of the aromatic residues along the αHL polypeptide chain shows that seven of the eight tryptophan residues are in the carboxyl-terminal half of αHL, and eight of the 14 tyrosine residues are located on the N-terminal half. This gives rise to the possibility that the tertiary contacts may be localized on the first half of the polypeptide chain. All of these observations strongly suggest that significant perturbations to the αHL structure had occurred in the absence of the carboxyl terminus. Interestingly, the additional amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (as in CEM) did not have any influence either on the structure or the function of native αHL. The CEM exhibited all of the characteristics of αHL. Proteolytic digestion revealed an αHL-like pattern, and the protein was able to oligomerize and cause the lysis of rRBCs. It has the same fluorescence emission maximum as αHL, which suggests that the tryptophans of both of the proteins are in a similar environment. Like αHL, it does not have any of its hydrophobic regions exposed to the solvent, as demonstrated by the negligible ANS binding. All of these points illustrate that it is possible to build residues at the carboxyl terminus of αHL without inhibiting its folding or function. The non-αHL like structure of the CDM can be interpreted as its being unable to “attain/maintain” the native, αHL-like conformation, and for that the carboxyl terminus is very crucial. We have tested for such a possibility by in vitro transcription and translation, whereby the activity of the CDM was assessed as it emerged from the ribosome during in vitro translation. The hemolytic activity of αHL, CDM, and CEM was examined as a function of initiation of translation. It is clear from Fig.7 that at constant rate of transcription and translation, αHL begins to show lysis within minutes after initiation of translation, whereas the CDM fails to show any lysis. On the other hand, the CEM lyses rRBCs efficiently but marginally slower when compared with αHL. This shows that freshly synthesized αHL folds rapidly to attain its native, active structure, but the CDM is unable to do so although it lacks just four amino acids. This suggests that the CDM is probably stuck in a partly folded inactive state. The physical state of the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of αHL is intriguing, since these mutants cannot participate in interprotomer interactions to form oligomers on rRBCs. They can however, bind the rRBCs and remain in the form of a cell-bound monomer (3Walker B.J. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is not surprising, because partially folded states of proteins are shown to bind membranes with high affinity (24Bychkova V.E. Pain R.H. Ptitysn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of αHL reveals that the N-terminal latch makes extensive contacts with the inner β-sheet of an adjacent protomer. Yet, when as many as 22 residues are deleted from the N terminus, αHL is still able to form oligomers (although yet to be fully characterized). This is because in a heptamer, each protomer participates in about 120 salt bridges and hydrogen bonds and 850 van der Waals contacts (2Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). In the absence of a few of these interactions, as in the case of an N-terminal deletion mutant, the net force of the remaining interactions is enough to drive the process to the oligomeric state. However, this does not seem to happen in the case of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants, and they are unable to carry out such fruitful interactions either among themselves (i.e. formation of homooligomer) or with αHL (i.e. formation of hetrooligomer). Our data are clearly able to reveal the reason behind the inefficient oligomerization of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants. The present data unequivocally prove that the CDM possess a partially folded nonnative conformation with greatly diminished tertiary structure. Such a species could still bind rRBCs through nonspecific hydrophobic interactions but does not possess the requisite motifs for carrying out interprotomer interactions. As a result, it cannot form either homooligomers with itself or hetrooligomers with αHL. We have also examined the lysis efficiency of the hetrooligomers of αHL and CEM by mixing a fixed amount of αHL with increasing amounts of CEM. As seen in TableII, the percentage of lysis increases with increasing amounts of the CEM, which shows that the extended carboxyl terminus does not interfere with the assembly of αHL (i.e. during formation of functional pore). This is in contrast to the amino-terminal deletion mutant αHL(5–293), which retards the lysis of αHL as reported by us earlier (4Vandana S. Manoj R. Krishnasastry M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This again supports our conclusion that the carboxyl terminus is not very critical for the oligomerization process but instead is involved in the folding of the monomer form. The molten globule states of proteins have been attributed with four distinct features, viz. compactness, a near native secondary structure, loss of tertiary structure, and exposure of hydrophobic regions (25Fink A.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 40: 343-358PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity of CDM for ANS reveals that it has hydrophobic regions exposed to the solvent. In addition, the CDM exhibited the presence of substantial secondary structure accompanied by a significant loss of tertiary structure. We could not, however, determine the compactness of the CDM due to its tendency to interact with gel filtration matrices. All these observations suggest that in the absence of the carboxyl terminus, the physical state of αHL may lie close to a molten globule-like state. Furthermore, the observations presented here strongly suggest that αHL is able to fold to its native form only after its complete synthesis, and/or the CDM is not able to “latch on” to native αHL-like structure because of the absence of the carboxyl terminus. In summary, for the first time, the role of the carboxyl terminus of αHL has been delineated in greater detail. While the amino terminus is important for the functional pore formation step, the carboxyl terminus is crucial for correct folding and maintenance of the water-soluble monomer form of αHL. Removal of just four residues from the carboxyl terminus makes the protein unable to proceed beyond a molten globule-like state. This information would be valuable to understand how membrane binding toxins like αHL carry out their folding and function. Since single amino acid substitutions at the carboxyl terminus do not affect the function, the length (i.e. backbone) of the protein appears to be vital instead of the actual sequence at the carboxyl terminus. In addition, we have shown that the addition of an extra sequence at the carboxyl terminus does not affect the folding or function of αHL. Such molecules could form the basis for construction of new molecules in the future. We thank Prof. A. Surolia, Dr. G. C. Mishra, and Dr. Amit Ghosh for encouragement."
