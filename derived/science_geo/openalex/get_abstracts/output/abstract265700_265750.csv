https://openalex.org/W1992879982,"The mean oxygen-18 content of continental ice sheets during the last glacial maximum is estimated to deltaO(18)=-30 per mille or less, and the consequent change in the isotopic composition of the oceans at that time to 1.2 per mille or more. This means that at least 70 percent of the oxygen-18 variations found in shells of planktonic foraminifera from deep-sea cores between times of glacial maximums and minimums are due to isotopic changes in ocean water, and at most 30 percent to changes in ocean surface temperature. Hence, Emiliani's ""paleotemperature"" curve rather depicts the amount of ice on the continents in excess of that present today. In this sense it may be renamed a ""paleoglaciation"" curve."
https://openalex.org/W1964856050,"Noble and Schmidt (1) in 1937 showed that the sense organ in the facial pit of blindfolded crotalidsrattlesnakes, copperheads, and moccasins—mediates the ability to strike correctly at moving objects such as a dead rat or a cloth-wrapped light bulb and to distinguish between warm and cold ones. They attempted to describe its sensitivity in terms of the reading of a mercury thermometer in the air at the position of the snake's head. However, it seems indicated by their conditions that radiant energy was the effective stimulus. We have undertaken to find out what can be learned of the function of this organ by recording activity from its nerves. The present paper is a preliminary report based on multi-unit analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2000123683,"Variations in the earth's rotation (UT1) and length of day have been tracked at the submillisecond level by astronomical radio interferometry and laser ranging to the LAGEOS satellite. Three years of regular measurements reveal complex patterns of variations including UT1 fluctuations as large as 5 milliseconds in a few weeks. Comparison of the observed changes in length of day with variations in the global atmospheric angular momentum indicates that the dominant cause of changes in the earth's spin rate, on time scales from a week to several years, is the exchange of angular momentum between the atmosphere and the mantle. The unusually intense El Niño of 1982-1983 was marked by a strong peak in the length of day."
https://openalex.org/W1996732648,"During the Mariner 7 flyby of Mars, the infrared spectrometer recorded distinct, sharp absorption. near 3020 and 3300 reciprocal centimeters between 61 degrees S and 80 degrees S. at the edge of the southern polar cap, with maximum optical density near 68 degrees S and 341 degrees E. These hands, which match in frequency the v(3) bands of methane and ammonia, can be associated with previously unreported spectral features of solid carbon dioxide exceeding 1 millimeter in thickness. Possible reasons for the geographic localization are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1990996662,"Comparative herbarium studies, floral anatomy, and distributional data show that Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa, an araliad with hypogynous flowers, evolved in Hawaii from ancestors with epigynous flowers. Suggested causes for this reversal of a well-known evolutionary trend are (i) isolation of the ancestors from flower-eating predators and (ii) selection for increased outcrossing."

https://openalex.org/W2044479972,"Blocky fragments of aegirine-augite trachyte (with accompanying icerafted gravels.) were recovered from the upper slopes of Kodiak Seamount in several dredge hauls. An alkali basalt pillow segment was also dredged from a moatlike depression, at a depth of 5000 meters, near the west base of the seamount. These retrievals confirm the volcanic origin of Kodiak Seamount and further support the view of Engel, Engel, and Havens that the higher elevations of seamounts are composed of alkali basalts or related variants."
https://openalex.org/W1983250928,"In this era of rapid, far-reaching transformation, our way of life is in many respects a novelty for our species. Opportunities arising from profoundly enhanced capabilities in science and technology are felt in every sphere of life from health to communication, yet each advance has side effects that take time to appear. Grave institutional inadequacies are manifested in the prevalence of totalitarian governments, proliferation of devastating weapons, failure of educational institutions to prepare most people for the modern world, failure to use what we know to prevent damage to a large proportion of the world's children; and the weakness of international institutions to deal with global interdependence in the face of persistent ethnocentrism and prejudice. The American scientific community can usefully become more deeply engaged with these great problems."

https://openalex.org/W2009516221,"Only a few nonnuclear weapons states with uranium-fueled power plants have kept the weapons option open, and none has evidenced activities intended for diverting fissionable material from its civilian system. Analysis of alternative strategies shows that acquisition of nuclear weapons material would probably depend on military production facilities rather than diversion. Horizontal proliferation is primarily a political issue and is related only marginally to uranium power development. Restrictions of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act on the supply of equipment and fuel by the United States appear to have induced, in some nonnuclear weapons states, the building of small-scale facilities that can be modified for production of weapons material. More attention should be given to the international political, economic, and military factors that persuade such states to abjure nuclear weapons."
https://openalex.org/W2017361481,"The objective of any system of transliteration is obviously to convey to the reader as closely as possible the phonetic value of the transliterated material. Barring phonetic transcriptions, this objective is doubtless best accomplished when (i) minimum use is made of extra marks and extra letter combinations that of necessity are arbitrary, unclear, and confusing to many readers, and when, of course (ii), there is only one uniform system and not a variety of varying ones. A detailed analysis reveals that present-day practices of transliterating Russian into English by no means conform to these desiderata, but that they could readily be made to do so. With only two extra letter combinations, zh for and kh for x, and a single and a double apostrophe for the ""soft"" and ""hard"" marks, a very close approximation of Russian phonology may be attained through a discriminating use of English as is. A complete and uniform transliteration of Russian into English, including the noncontroversial letters, is shown in Table 1."
