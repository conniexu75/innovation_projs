https://openalex.org/W1968713120,"Fresh fracture surfaces of the martian meteorite ALH84001 contain abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These fresh fracture surfaces also display carbonate globules. Contamination studies suggest that the PAHs are indigenous to the meteorite. High-resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopy study of surface textures and internal structures of selected carbonate globules show that the globules contain fine-grained, secondary phases of single-domain magnetite and Fe-sulfides. The carbonate globules are similar in texture and size to some terrestrial bacterially induced carbonate precipitates. Although inorganic formation is possible, formation of the globules by biogenic processes could explain many of the observed features, including the PAHs. The PAHs, the carbonate globules, and their associated secondary mineral phases and textures could thus be fossil remains of a past martian biota."

The resorption of preexisting bone by osteoclasts and the formation of new bone by osteoblasts is strictly coordinated to maintain bone mass within defined limits. A few molecular determinants of bone remodelling that affect osteoclast activity1–3 have been characterized, but the molecular determinants of osteoblast activity are unknown. To investigate the role of osteocalcin, the most abundant osteoblast-specific non-collagenous protein4, we have generated osteocalcin-deficient mice. These mice develop a phenotype marked by higher bone mass and bones of improved functional quality. Histomorphometric studies done before and after ovariectomy showed that the absence of osteocalcin leads to an increase in bone formation without impairing bone resorption. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that osteocalcin is a determinant of bone formation."

Some materials have now demonstrated adequate efficiencies (1 to 15 lumens/watt) and lifetimes (>5000 hours) for practical use; however, the factors that govern lifetime remain poorly understood. This article provides a brief review of device principles and applications requirements and focuses on the understanding of reliability issues."

https://openalex.org/W2083398588,"A mouse platelet-derived growth factor A chain (PDGF-A) null allele is shown to be homozygous lethal, with two distinct restriction points, one prenatally before E10 and one postnatally. Postnatally surviving PDGF-A-deficient mice develop lung emphysema secondary to the failure of alveolar septation. This is apparently caused by the loss of alveolar myofibroblasts and associated elastin fiber deposits. PDGF alpha receptor-positive cells in the lung having the location of putative alveolar myofibroblast progenitors were specifically absent in PDGF-A null mutants. We conclude that PDGF-A is crucial for alveolar myofibroblast ontogeny. We have previously shown that PDGF-B is required in the ontogeny of kidney mesangial cells. The PDGFs therefore appear to regulate the generation of specific populations of myofibroblasts during mammalian development. The two PDGF null phenotypes also reveal analogous morphogenetic functions for myofibroblast-type cells in lung and kidney organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2028912535,"Living organisms construct various forms of laminated nanocomposites through directed nucleation and growth of inorganics at self-assembled organic templates at temperatures below 100&deg;C and in aqueous solutions. Recent research has focused on the use of functionalized organic surfaces to form continuous thin films of single-phase ceramics. Continuous thin films of mesostructured silicates have also been formed on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces through a two-step mechanism. First, under acidic conditions, surfactant micellar structures are self-assembled at the solid/liquid interface, and second, inorganic precursors condense to form an inorganic-organic nanocomposite. Epitaxial coordination of adsorbed surfactant tubules is observed on mica and graphite substrates, whereas a random arrangement is observed on amorphous silica. The ability to process ceramic-organic nanocomposite films by these methods provides new technological opportunities."

Thin films of an asymmetric polystyrene-polymethylmethacrylate diblock copolymer, with cylindrical polymethylmethacrylate microdomains, were spin-coated onto substrates previously patterned with planar electrodes. The substrates, 100-nanometer-thick silicon nitride membranes, allow direct observation of the electrodes and the copolymer domain structure by transmission electron microscopy. The cylinders aligned parallel to the electric field lines for fields exceeding 30 kilovolts per centimeter, after annealing at 250&deg;C in an inert atmosphere for 24 hours. This technique could find application in nanostructure fabrication."

https://openalex.org/W2034236995,"Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a conceptually and experimentally simple yet highly versatile tool for thin-film and multilayer research. Its advantages for the film growth of oxides and other chemically complex materials include stoichiometric transfer, growth from an energetic beam, reactive deposition, and inherent simplicity for the growth of multilayered structures. With the use of PLD, artificially layered materials and metastable phases have been created and their properties varied by control of the layer thicknesses. In situ monitoring techniques have provided information about the role of energetic species in the formation of ultrahard phases and in the doping of semiconductors. Cluster-assembled nanocrystalline and composite films offer opportunities to control and produce new combinations of properties with PLD."

The energies and linewidths of the homogeneous spectrum provide a new perspective on the dephasing dynamics of the exciton in a quantum-confined, solid-state system. The origins of the linewidths are discussed in terms of the dynamics of the exciton in zero dimensions, in particular, in terms of lifetime broadening through the emission or absorption of phonons and photons."
https://openalex.org/W1976631985,"Homologous recombination in embryonal stem cells has been used to produce a fusion oncogene, thereby mimicking chromosomal translocations that frequently result in formation of tumor-specific fusion oncogenes in human malignancies. AF9 sequences were fused into the mouse Mll gene so that expression of the Mll–AF9 fusion gene occurred from endogenous Mll transcription control elements, as in t(9;11) found in human leukemias. Chimeric mice carrying the fusion gene developed tumors, which were restricted to acute myeloid leukemias despite the widespread activity of the Mll promoter. Onset of perceptible disease was preceded by expansion of ES cell derivatives in peripheral blood. This novel use of homologous recombination formally proves that chromosomal translocations contribute to malignancy and provides a general strategy to create fusion oncogenes for studying their role in tumorigenesis.*Present address: Centro de Hemodonacion, Universidad de Murcia, Ronda de Garay, 30003 Murcia, Spain. † Present address: Wellcome Trust Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge School of Medicine, Cambridge CB2 2SP, United Kingdom."

https://openalex.org/W1994720156,"The molecular organization in ultrathin polymer films (thicknesses less than 1000 angstroms) and thin polymer films (thicknesses between 1000 and 10,000 angstroms) may differ substantially from that of bulk polymers, which can lead to important differences in resulting thermophysical properties. Such constrained geometry films have been fabricated from amorphous poly(3-methyl-4-hydroxy styrene) (PMHS) and semicrystalline poly(di-n-hexyl silane) (PD6S) by means of spin-casting. The residual solvent content is substantially greater in ultrathin PMHS films, which suggests a higher glass transition temperature that results from a stronger hydrogen-bonded network as compared with that in thicker films. Crystallization of PD6S is substantially hindered in ultrathin films, in which a critical thickness of 150 angstroms is needed for crystalline morphology to exist and in which the rate of crystallization is initially slow but increases rapidly as the film approaches 500 angstroms in thickness."

The conserved PxxP sequence motif of Nef, known to be important for optimal viral replication, is part of a polyproline type II helix that engages the SH3 domain in a manner resembling closely the interaction of isolated peptides with SH3 domains. The Nef–SH3 structure also reveals how high affinity and specificity in the SH3 interaction is achieved by the presentation of the PxxP motif within the context of the folded structure of Nef."

This review emphasizes chemical solution deposition, in which a solution is used to deposit a layer of precursor molecules that decompose to low-density, polycrystalline films during heating. Ways to control film cracking during deposition and heat treatment and why many precursors synthesize metastable crystalline structures are discussed, and the different mechanisms that convert the polycrystalline film into a single crystal are reviewed. Hydrothermal epitaxy, in which single crystal thin films are directly synthesized on templating substrates in an aqueous solution at temperatures <150&deg;C, is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2013670635,"The structure of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) in complex with IMP and mycophenolic acid (MPA) has been determined by X-ray diffraction. IMPDH plays a central role in B and T lymphocyte replication. MPA is a potent IMPDH inhibitor and the active metabolite of an immunosuppressive drug recently approved for the treatment of allograft rejection. IMPDH comprises two domains: a core domain, which is an alpha/beta barrel and contains the active site, and a flanking domain. The complex, in combination with mutagenesis and kinetic data, provides a structural basis for understanding the mechanism of IMPDH activity and indicates that MPA inhibits IMPDH by acting as a replacement for the nicotinamide portion of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor and a catalytic water molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1982554152,"Affinity maturation by somatic hypermutation is thought to occur within germinal centres. Mice deficient in lymphotoxin-alpha (LT alpha-/- mice) have no lymph nodes or Peyer's patches, and fail to form germinal centres in the spleen. We tested whether germinal centres are essential for maturation of antibody responses to T-cell-dependent antigens. LT alpha-/- mice immunized with low doses of (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl-ovalbumin (NP-OVA) showed dramatically impaired production of high-affinity anti-NP IgG1. However, LT alpha-/- mice immunized with high doses of NP-OVA, even though they failed to produce germinal centres, manifested a high-affinity anti-NP IgG1 response similar to wild-type mice. Furthermore, when LT alpha-/- mice were multiply immunized with high doses of NP-OVA, the predominantly expressed anti-NP VH gene segment VH186.2 showed somatic mutations typical of affinity maturation. Thus, B-cell memory and affinity maturation are not absolutely dependent on the presence of germinal centres."

This analysis gives an Mn-O distance of 1.90 angstroms, which is significantly shorter than the Mn-O distances (1.94 to 2.00 angstroms) observed in phases based on LaMnO3 perovskites that exhibit CMR. Both results in Tl2Mn2O7 indicate oxidation states very close to Tl23+Mn24+O7. Thus, Tl2Mn2O7 has neither mixed valence for a double-exchange magnetic interaction nor a Jahn-Teller cation such as Mn3+, both of which were thought to have an important function in CMR materials. An alternate mechanism for CMR in Tl2Mn2O7 based on magnetic ordering driven by superexchange and strong spin-fluctuation scattering above the Curie temperature is proposed here."

The rearrangement of particular Ig and TCR gene segments, however, is tightly regulated with respect to cell lineage and developmental stage. Using an in vitro system, we analyzed recombinase cleavage of RSSs flanking Ig and TCR gene segments in nuclei. We found that both the lineage-specificity and temporal ordering of gene rearrangement is reflected in the accessibility of RSSs within chromatin to in vitro cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2012941238,"The mitochondrial members of the highly conserved AAA family, Yta10p and Yta12p, constitute a membrane-embedded complex of about 850 kDa. As an ATP dependent metallopeptidase (AAA protease), the YTA10-12 complex mediates the degradation of nonassembled inner membrane proteins. In contrast to nucleotide-dependent complex formation and substrate binding, proteolysis of bound polypeptides depends on the hydrolysis of ATP and the metallopeptidase activity of both subunits. Independent of its proteolytic function, the chaperone-like activity of the YTA10-12 complex is required for assembly of the membrane-associated ATP synthase. We propose that proteolytic and chaperone-like activities in the YTA10-12 complex mediate assembly and degradation processes of membrane protein complexes and thereby exert key functions in the maintenance of membrane integrity."

The nitride superlattice films can be deposited economically by reactive sputtering in production-size equipment on a variety of substrates. A model for the superlattice strength enhancement has been developed that accurately predicts which materials can be used together to produce the enhanced hardness. Advancements in sputtering technology-specifically, pulsed dc power and reactive-gas partial-pressure control-make it possible to reactively deposit nonconducting oxide films at high deposition rates. This technology is being used along with the superlattice strength model in the development of oxide superlattice films."

https://openalex.org/W2016049505,The SH2 domain-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase Corkscrew (CSW) is an essential component of the signaling pathway initiated by the activation of the sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase (SEV) during Drosophila eye development. We have used genetic and biochemical approaches to identify a substrate for CSW. Expression of a catalytically inactive CSW was used to trap CSW in a complex with a 115 kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate. This substrate was purified and identified as the product of the daughter of sevenless (dos) gene. Mutations of dos were identified in a screen for dominant mutations which enhance the phenotype caused by overexpression of inactive CSW during photoreceptor development. Analysis of dos mutations indicates that DOS is a positive component of the SEV signaling pathway and suggests that DOS dephosphorylation by CSW may be a key event during signaling by SEV.
https://openalex.org/W2051978498,"GALAXIES are believed to have formed a large proportion of their stars in giant bursts of star formation early in their lives, but when and how this took place are still very uncertain. The presence1–6 of large amounts of dust in quasars and radio galaxies at redshifts z > 4 shows that some synthesis of heavy elements had already occurred at this time. This implies that molecular gas—the building material of stars—should also be present, as it is in galaxies at lower redshifts (z ≈ 2.5, refs 7–10). Here we report the detection of emission from dust and carbon monoxide in the radio-quiet quasar BR1202 – 0725, at redshift z = 4.69. Maps of these emissions reveal two objects, separated by a few arc seconds, which could indicate either the presence of a companion to the quasar or gravitational lensing of the quasar itself. Regardless of the precise interpretation of the maps, the detection of carbon monoxide confirms the presence of a large mass of molecular gas in one of the most distant galaxies known, and shows that conditions conducive to huge bursts of star formation existed in the very early Universe."

Each nanotube is pulled from a micropipette-held feeder vesicle by mechanical retraction of the vesicle after molecular bonding to a rigid substrate. The caliber of the tube is controlled precisely in a range from 20 to 200 nanometers merely by setting the suction pressure in the micropipette. Branched conduits can be formed by coalescing separate nanotubes drawn serially from the feeder vesicle surface. Single nanotubes and nanotube junctions can be linked together between bonding sites on a surface to create a functionalized network. After assembly, the templates can be stabilized by photoinitiated radical cross-linking of macromonomers contained in the aqueous solution confined by the lipid bilayer boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2028834438,"The specification of the R7 photoreceptor cell in the developing eye of Drosophila is dependent upon activation of the Sevenless (SEV) receptor tyrosine kinase. By screening for mutations that suppress signaling via a constitutively activated SEV protein, we have identified a novel gene, daughter of sevenless (dos). DOS is required not only for signal transduction via SEV but also in other receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways throughout development. The presence of an amino-terminally located pleckstrin homology domain and many potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites suggests that DOS functions as an adaptor protein able to interact with multiple signaling molecules. Our genetic analysis demonstrates that DOS functions upstream of Ras1 and defines a signaling pathway that is independent of direct binding of the DRK SH2/SH3 adaptor protein to the SEV receptor tyrosine kinase."

As a result, compounds were shown to form between potassium and the transition metal nickel. These results demonstrate that the chemical behavior of the alkali metals under pressure is very different from that under ambient conditions, where alkali metals and transition metals do not react because of large differences in size and electronic structure. They also have significant implications for the hypothesis that potassium is incorporated into Earth's core."

On heating at atmospheric pressure, this solid became viscous water (water B), with a reversible glass-liquid transition onset at 129 +/- 2 kelvin. A different form of viscous water (water A) was formed by heating the uncompressed vapor-deposited amorphous solid and hyperquenched liquid water. On thermal cycling up to 148 kelvin, water B remained kinetically and thermodynamically distinct from water A.

Jupiter's magnetic field is caused by convective dynamo motion of electrically conducting fluid hydrogen. The data imply that Jupiter should become metallic at 140 gigapascals in the fluid, and the electrical conductivity in the jovian molecular envelope at pressures up to metallization is about an order of magnitude larger than expected previously.
