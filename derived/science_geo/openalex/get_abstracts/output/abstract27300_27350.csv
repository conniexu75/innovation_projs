https://openalex.org/W2045008512,"In order to examine the mechanisms by which clonal deletion of autoreactive T cells occurs, a peptide antigen was used to induce deletion of antigen-reactive thymocytes in vivo. Mice transgenic for a T cell receptor (TCR) that reacts to this peptide contain thymocytes that progress from the immature to the mature phenotype. Intraperitoneal administration of the peptide antigen to transgenic mice results in a rapid deletion of the immature CD4+ CD8+ TCRlo thymocytes. Apoptosis of cortical thymocytes can be seen within 20 hours of treatment. These results provide direct evidence for the in vivo role of apoptosis in the development of antigen-induced tolerance."

https://openalex.org/W1990668606,"A poorly immunogenic murine colon cancer was used to investigate mechanisms of antitumor immunity. Injection of tumor cells engineered by gene transfection to secrete IL-2 stimulated an MHC class I-restricted cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against the parental tumor. The tumor cells secreting IL-2 produced an antitumor response in vivo, even in the absence of CD4+ T cells. Animals immunized with the engineered cells were protected against subsequent challenge with the parental tumor cell line. Similar findings were demonstrated for other tumor types. Thus, provision of a helper lymphokine in a paracrine fashion induced a tumor-specific immune response involving activation of endogenous CTLs and other immune effector cells. These findings demonstrate that the failure of an effective antitumor immune response may be primarily due to a helper arm deficiency of the immune system rather than a paucity of tumor-specific cytotoxic effector cells. Furthermore, they outline a novel strategy for augmenting tumor immunity."

https://openalex.org/W1540964771,"An assay for the enzyme responsible for the addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to proteins, a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:peptide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, is reported using the synthetic peptide YSDSPSTST as the acceptor substrate. The activity is linearly dependent on time, enzyme, and substrate concentration. Replacement of the proline with a glycine in the peptide renders it ineffective as a substrate, whereas changing of the aspartic acid to a glycine has no effect. Product characterization of the glycosylated peptide demonstrates that the monosaccharide covalently attached to the peptide is N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and has not been epimerized to N-acetylgalactosamine. Mild base-catalyzed beta-elimination of the in vitro glycosylated peptide quantitatively yields GlcNAcitol, indicating that the GlcNAc is attached via an O-linkage. The transferase activity is strongly inhibited by UDP but is unaffected by GlcNAc or tunicamycin. Interestingly, EDTA only slightly inhibits activity, suggesting that the enzyme may not require divalent cations. The majority of the activity is soluble, and the remainder is lost from membranes after extracting with high salt and EDTA. Consistent with the subcellular localization of most proteins bearing O-GlcNAc, the activity appears to reside in the cytosolic portion of the cell when compared to two lumenal marker enzymes, galactosyltransferase and mannose-6-phosphatase."

https://openalex.org/W2159352556,A major mechanism for generating tolerance in developing T cells is the intrathymic clonal deletion of T cells that have receptors for those self antigens that are presented on hematopoietic cells. The mechanisms of tolerance induction to antigens not expressed in the thymus remain unclear. Tolerance to self antigens can be generated extrathymically through the induction of clonal nonresponsiveness in T cells with self-reactive receptors. A second mechanism of extrathymic tolerance was identified: clonal elimination of mature T cells with self-reactive receptors that had previously displayed functional reactivity.
https://openalex.org/W2081274261,"We have analyzed RNP formation and nucleocytoplasmic migration of 5S RNA and 5S RNA variants transcribed from microinjected genes in Xenopus oocytes. Using antisera against three different proteins we find that newly transcribed nuclear 5S rRNA transiently interacts with La antigen. The La protein is then replaced by either ribosomal protein L5 or the 5S gene-specific transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA), and each of these two RNPs migrates out of the nucleus and accumulates in the cytoplasm. RNA molecules that are impaired in their ability to interact with L5 and TFIIIA are retained in the nucleus. Thus, L5 and TFIIIA define a new functional class of proteins involved in the nuclear export of RNA. In addition, we show that RNP migration depletes the nucleus of TFIIIA, resulting in a loss of transcription competence for newly injected 5S rRNA genes."
https://openalex.org/W1564075285,"Addition of ATP or ATP analog to the incubation media is shown to result in cell death in experiments with different cultured cell lines as evidenced by the results of several independent assays, both in the absence or presence of extracellular Ca2+. Cytolytic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone itself was not only resistant to cytolytic effects of ATP, but was able to rescue antigen-nonbearing 51Cr-labeled cells from lytic effects of extracellular ATP (but not from lytic effects of adenosine 5'-thiotriphosphate) when present during assay. To test whether the resistance of CTL to ATP is due to a high activity of ecto-ATPase, four independent assays of ATPase activity were utilized to demonstrate the presence and relatively high activity of the ecto-ATPase(s) on CTL surface. Studies of substrate specificity of CTL ecto-ATPase suggest that there is more than one nucleoside 5'-triphosphatase on the surface of CTL. The enzyme(s) activity is Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent and in this respect is similar to recently described hepatic cells ecto-ATPase. We tested effects of known ATP-binding site-specific reagents fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC) and 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) to find covalent modification procedures to be used in studies of functional role of ecto-ATPase. FSBA, but not FITC, inhibits lymphocyte ecto-ATPase but addition of ATP together with FSBA protects ecto-ATPase activity. Inactivation of CTL ecto-ATPase by pretreatment with FSBA makes CTL susceptible to lytic effects of extracellular ATP, as was hypothesized for the functional role of this enzyme in CTL."
https://openalex.org/W2078844181,"The role of exocytosis of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules in the presentation of antigens to mouse cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) was examined by use of a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses the E19 glycoprotein from adenovirus. E19 blocked the presentation of vaccinia and influenza virus proteins to CTLs in a MHC class I allele-specific manner identical to its inhibition of MHC class I transport from the endoplasmic reticulum. This finding indicates that (i) the relevant parameter for antigen presentation is the rate of MHC class I molecule exocytosis, not the level of class I cell surface expression, and (ii) association of class I molecules with antigen is likely to occur within the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1593219092,"The Ca2(+)-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is under regulation by phospholamban, an oligomeric proteolipid. To determine the molecular mechanism by which phospholamban regulates the Ca2(+)-ATPase, a reconstitution system was developed, using a freeze-thaw sonication procedure. The best rates of Ca2+ uptake (700 nmol/min/mg reconstituted vesicles compared with 800 nmol/min/mg SR vesicles) were observed when cholate and phosphatidylcholine were used at a ratio of cholate/phosphatidylcholine/Ca2(+)-ATPase of 2:80:1. The EC50 values for Ca2+ were 0.05 microM for both Ca2+ uptake and Ca2(+)-ATPase activity in the reconstituted vesicles compared with 0.63 microM Ca2+ in native SR vesicles. Inclusion of phospholamban in the reconstituted vesicles was associated with a significant inhibition of the initial rates of Ca2+ uptake at pCa 6.0. However, phosphorylation of phospholamban by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase reversed the inhibitory effect on the Ca2+ pump. Similar findings were observed when a peptide, corresponding to amino acids 1-25 of phospholamban, was used. These findings indicate that phospholamban is an inhibitor of the Ca2(+)-ATPase in cardiac SR and phosphorylation of phospholamban relieves this inhibition. The mechanism by which phospholamban inhibits the Ca2+ pump is unknown, but our findings with the synthetic peptide suggest that a direct interaction between the Ca2(+)-ATPase and the hydrophilic portion of phospholamban may be one of the mechanisms for regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2044862603,"One of the functions of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) in the splicing reaction of pre-mRNA molecules is the recognition of the 5′ splice site. U1 snRNP proteins as well as base-pair interactions between U1 snRNA and the 5′ splice site are important for the formation of the snRNP-pre-mRNA complex. To determine which proteins are needed for complex formation, the ability of U1 snRNPs gradually depleted of the U1-specific proteins C, A, and 70k to bind to an RNA molecule containing a 5′ splice site sequence was studied in a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. The most significant effect was always observed when protein C was removed, either alone or together with other U1-specific proteins; the binding was reduced by 50 to 60%. Complementation of protein C-deficient U1 snRNPs with purified C protein restored their 5′ splice site binding activity. These data suggest that protein C may potentiate the base-pair interaction between U1 RNA and the 5′ splice site."
https://openalex.org/W1520250133,"We have proposed earlier that caldesmon inhibits the actin-activated ATPase activity of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) by inhibiting the binding of the HMM.ATP complex to the productive site of actin (Hemric, M. E., and Chalovich, J. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1868-1885). This has been difficult to prove directly because caldesmon also binds to HMM and it is difficult to distinguish the actin-caldesmon-HMM complex from the actin-caldesmon complex in binding studies. We have eliminated the interaction between caldesmon and smooth HMM by digestion of caldesmon with chymotrypsin. This cleaved caldesmon inhibits the actin-activated ATPase rate of smooth HMM and this inhibition is correlated with a decrease in the binding of HMM.ATP to actin. Therefore, caldesmon functions by inhibiting the binding of the myosin-ATP complex to actin regardless of the source of myosin. We have also isolated the myosin-binding region of caldesmon and have performed a partial sequence. Comparison of this sequence with the derived sequence of caldesmon demonstrates, unequivocally, that the myosin-binding region of caldesmon begins at the amino terminus and extends beyond the first Cys residue."
https://openalex.org/W1484681199,"The amino-terminal region of muscle tropomyosin is highly conserved among muscle and 284-residue non-muscle tropomyosins. Analysis of fusion and nonfusion striated alpha-tropomyosins and a mutant in which residues 1-9 have been deleted has shown that the amino terminus is crucial for function. The presence of 80 amino acids of a nonstructural influenza virus protein (NS1) on the amino terminus of tropomyosin allows magnesium-independent binding of tropomyosin to actin. The fusion tropomyosin inhibits the actomyosin S1 ATPase at all myosin S1 concentrations tested, indicating that the presence of the fusion peptide prevents myosin S1 from switching the actin filament from the inhibited to the potentiated state. Nonfusion tropomyosin, an unacetylated form, has no effect on the actomyosin S1 ATPase, though it regulates normally with troponin. Deletion of residues 1-9, which are believed to overlap with the carboxyl-terminal end of tropomyosin in the thin filament, results in loss of tropomyosin function. The mutant is unable to bind to actin, in the presence and absence of troponin, and it has no regulatory function. The removal of the first 9 residues of tropomyosin is much more deleterious than removal of the last 11 by carboxypeptidase digestion. We suggest that the structure of the amino-terminal region and acetylation of the initial methionine are crucial for tropomyosin function."
https://openalex.org/W1587585707,"Lipocortin-85 (L-85, calpactin-I/lipocortin-II heterotetramer) binds to F-actin in the presence of calcium with high affinity and in a cooperative manner. Quantitative analysis of binding curves indicate an apparent Kd (L-85) of 0.226 microM +/- 0.153 (2 S.D., n = 3), a stoichiometry of L-85/actin of 1:1.9 and a Hill coefficient of 1.37 +/- 0.14 (2 S.D., n = 3). Large anisotropic bundles were visualized by electron microscopy under these conditions, and quantitation of bundling by both low speed sedimentation and light scattering yielded apparent Kd values between 0.12 and 0.27 microM L-85. Filament bundling was dependent upon calcium, and the calcium sensitivity was increased by raising the molar ratio of lipocortin-85/F-actin. At saturating levels of L-85, apparent K0.5 values of 0.1-2 microM Ca2+f were obtained. The monomeric heavy chain, lipocortin-II, bundled F-actin to a much lesser extent and at much higher concentrations than for lipocortin-85. Bundling of F-actin by lipocortin-I was not detected at molar ratios of lipocortin-I to actin as high as 2.5 mol/mol (lipocortin-I/actin). At 5-10 microM Ca2+f and saturating levels of L-85, F-actin bundling progressed very rapidly with a t0.5 of 6 s. The process was quickly reversed by the addition of excess EGTA, and bundles could be reformed by the addition of a second burst of 5-10 microM Ca2+f. Thus, our data suggest that lipocortin-85 can rapidly regulate F-actin bundling in a calcium-dependent manner at physiologically relevant calcium levels."
https://openalex.org/W1487037776,"In these studies we demonstrate that insulin stimulates both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor after its partial purification on wheat germ-agarose, and after affinity purification on insulin-agarose. Analysis of the serine phosphate incorporated into partially purified or highly purified insulin receptor suggests that an insulin-sensitive serine kinase (IRSK) copurifies with the insulin receptor. Following trypsin digestion, reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the phosphorylated, affinity-purified insulin receptor preparation reveals phosphopeptide profiles similar to those of trypsin-digested receptors immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled fibroblasts overexpressing the human insulin receptor. The major insulin-stimulated HPLC phosphopeptide peak from insulin receptors labeled in intact cells contains a hydrophilic phosphoserine-containing peptide which rapidly elutes from a C18 column. HPLC and two-dimensional separation indicate that the same phosphopeptide is obtained when affinity-purified insulin receptors are phosphorylated by IRSK. The serine containing tryptic peptide within the cytoplasmic domain of the human insulin receptor predicted to elute most rapidly upon HPLC had the sequence SSHCQR corresponding to residues 1293-1298. A synthetic peptide containing this sequence is phosphorylated by the insulin receptor/IRSK preparation. After alkylation and trypsin digestion, the synthetic phosphopeptide comigrates with the alkylated, tryptic phosphopeptide derived from insulin receptor phosphorylated in vitro by IRSK. We propose that serine 1293 or 1294 of the human insulin receptor is a major site(s) phosphorylated on the insulin receptor in intact cells and is phosphorylated by IRSK. Furthermore, insulin added directly to affinity-purified insulin receptor/IRSK preparations stimulates the phosphorylation of synthetic peptides corresponding to this receptor phosphorylation site and another containing threonine 1336. Kemptide phosphorylation is not stimulated by insulin under these conditions. No phosphorylation of peptide substrates for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, casein kinase II, or cGMP-dependent protein kinase by IRSK is detected. These data indicate that IRSK exhibits specificity for the insulin receptor and may be activated by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in an insulin-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1518364229,"Activated protein C has been observed to bind to the light chains of factor Va and factor VIII. Fragments of the factor VIII light chain were produced by recombinant DNA techniques and expressed in Escherichia coli. Three fragments of the light chain were studied; L4 (residues 1974-2332), L3.2 (residues 1560-1829 and 2046-2332), and L3.3 (residues 1560-2052). Two fragments, L4 and L3.3, which overlapped sequences between residues 1974-2052, inhibited the anticoagulant activity of activated protein C. Comparison of the sequences of factors V and VIII in this region revealed that residues 2005-2018 in the factor VIII sequence were homologous with residues 1861-1874 in the factor V sequence. The peptides Arg-Ala-Gly-Met-Gln-Thr-Phe-Leu-Ile (RAGMQTPFLI; residues 1865-1874) from the factor V sequence and His-Ala-Gly-Met-Ser-Thr-Leu-Phe-Ile-Val (HAGMSTLFIV; residues 2009-2018) from the factor VIII sequence were synthesized. Both peptides were observed to inhibit the anticoagulant activity of activated protein C and its inactivation of factors Va and VIII. Furthermore RAGMQTPFLI quenched the fluorescence of the dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-modified protease. Polyclonal antibodies against RAGMQTPFLI bound to factor Va and inhibited the anticoagulant activity of activated protein C and the inactivation of factor Va. These results indicate that a portion of the binding sites for activated protein C on the light chains of factors V and VIII are contained in the sequences RAGMQTPFLI or HAGMSTLFIV, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1754913005,"The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effects of 12.5 days of zero gravity (0 g) exposure (Cosmos 1887 Biosputnik) on the enzymatic properties, protein content, and isomyosin distribution of the myofibril fraction of the slow-twitch vastus intermedius (VI) and the fast-twitch vastus lateralis (VL) muscles of adult male rats. Measurements were obtained on three experimental groups (n = 5 each group) designated as flight group (FG), vivarium control (VC), and synchronous control (SC). Body weight of the FG was significantly lower than that of the two control groups (P less than 0.05). Compared with the two control groups, VI weight was lower by 23% (P less than 0.10), whereas no such pattern was apparent for the VL muscle. Myofibril yields (mg protein/g muscle) in the VI were 35% lower in the FG than in controls (P less than 0.05), whereas no such pattern was apparent for the VL muscle. When myofibril yields were expressed on a muscle basis (mg/g x muscle weight), the loss of myofibril protein was more exaggerated and suggests that myofibril protein degradation is an early event in the muscle atrophy response to 0 g. Analysis of myosin isoforms indicated that slow myosin (Sm) was the primary isoform lost in the calculated degradation of total myosin. No evidence of loss of the fast isomyosins was apparent for either muscle following spaceflight. Myofibril ATPase activity of the VI was increased in the FG compared with controls, which is consistent with the observation of preferential Sm degradation. These data suggest that muscles containing a high percentage of slow-twitch fibers undergo greater degrees of myofibril protein degradation than muscles containing predominantly fast-twitch fibers in response to a relatively short period of 0 g exposure, and the primary target appears to be the Sm molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1989899593,"We have determined the positions and sequences of 31 dominant mutations affecting a C. elegans muscle myosin heavy chain gene. These mutations alter thick filament structure in heterozygotes by interfering with the ability of wild-type myosin to assemble into stable thick filaments. These assembly-disruptive mutations are missense alleles affecting the globular head of myosin. The most strongly dominant alleles alter highly conserved residues of the myosin ATP binding site, indicating that functions of the myosin ATPase are important for thick filament assembly. Other alleles alter the site at which myosin binds actin."
https://openalex.org/W1602290343,"Fibronectin (FN) mRNA levels increased when quiescent cells (serum starved) were stimulated to undergo the G0/G1 transition by the addition of 20% given fetal calf serum to the media. The 5'-flanking region of the FN gene (position +69 to -510 base pairs (bp] was fused to the coding region of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), and the fusion gene was used in transfection assays. Expression of FNCAT increased on serum treatment indicating that the region of the FN gene between positions +69 and -510 bp mediated serum responsiveness. Deletion of FN gene 5'-flanking sequences from position -510 to -122 bp eliminated serum responsiveness suggesting that an element between these positions was mediating the effect. Sequences between positions -122 and -510 bp of the FN gene were able to confer serum responsiveness on a herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter-CAT fusion gene (TKCAT) when the FN gene sequences were cloned upstream of TKCAT. The ability to confer serum responsiveness on TKCAT was retained with a smaller 100-bp sequence (position -122 to -222 bp). Both a cAMP response element (position -170 bp) and a nuclear factor-1 binding site (position -155 bp) have been identified within this sequence (Dean, D. C., Blakeley, M. S., Newby, R. F., Ghazal, P., Hennighausen, L., and Bourgeois, S. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9, 1498-1506). The cAMP response element was serum-responsive when cloned upstream of TKCAT or a minimal FN promoter (deleted to position -56 bp) while the nuclear factor-1 binding site was unresponsive. Therefore, the cAMP regulatory element (CRE) is the serum-responsive element between position -122 and -222 bp. Serum-induced binding of proteins to the CRE was detected in gel retardation assays with extracts from cell lines where FN expression was serum-responsive. However, no serum-induced binding was detected with extracts from the JEG-3 cell line where FN expression was not serum-responsive. Serum-induced binding occurred rapidly, within 15 min, and did not require protein synthesis. The decay of serum-induced binding was relatively slow as increased binding was still detectable 24 h after removal of serum. The CRE also mediates transcriptional stimulation by cAMP, but unlike serum stimulation increased CRE binding activity was not detectable in extracts from cAMP-treated cells (Dean, D. C., Blakeley, M. S., Newby, R. F., Ghazal, P., Hennighausen, L., and Bourgeois, S. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9, 1498-1506).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1615863591,We report the expression of the human interferon-gamma (Hu-IFN-gamma) receptor from a cDNA clone in an animal cell where both stable expression of the cloned receptor as well as its biological activity is demonstrated for the first time. Biological activity of the receptor (i.e. expression of surface histocompatibility antigens in response to human interferon-gamma) requires the presence of human chromosome 21 demonstrating the requirement for at least one other species-specific factor in the modulation of receptor action. This system should now facilitate delineation of regions involved in the binding of human interferon-gamma and receptor signal transduction.
https://openalex.org/W1537680384,"To investigate the relationship between thin filament Ca2+ binding and activation of the MgATPase rate of myosin subfragment 1, native cardiac thin filaments were isolated and characterized. Direct measurements of 45Ca binding to the thin filament were consistent with non-cooperative binding to two high affinity sites (Ka 7.3 +/- 0.8 x 10(6) M-1) and either cooperative or non-cooperative binding to one low affinity site (Ka 4 +/- 2 x 10(5) M-1) per troponin at 25 degrees C, 30 mM ionic strength, pH 7.06. Addition of a low concentration of myosin subfragment 1 to the native thin filaments produced a Ca2+-regulated MgATPase activity with Kapp (2.5 +/- 1.3 x 10(5) M-1), matching the low affinity Ca2+ site. The MgATPase rate was cooperatively activated by Ca2+ (Hill coefficient 1.8). To determine whether Ca2+ binding to the low affinity sites was cooperative, native thin filament troponin was exchanged with troponin labeled on troponin C with 2-(4'-iodoacetamidanilo)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid. From the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescence of this complex, Ca2+ binding was cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 1.7-2.0. Using the troponin-exchanged thin filaments, myosin subfragment 1 MgATPase rate activation was also cooperative and closely proportional to Ca2+ thin filament binding. Reconstitution of the thin filament from its components raised the Ca2+ affinity by a factor of 2 (compared with native thin filaments) and incorporation of fluorescently modified troponin raised the Ca2+ affinity by another factor of 2. Stoichiometrically reconstituted thin filaments produced non-cooperative MgATPase rate activation, contrasting with cooperative activation with native thin filaments, troponin-exchanged thin filaments and thin filaments reconstituted with a stoichiometric excess of troponin. The Ca2+-induced fluorescence transition of stoichiometrically reconstituted thin filaments was non-cooperative. These results suggest that Ca2+ binds cooperatively to the regulatory sites of the cardiac thin filament, even in the absence of myosin, and even though cardiac troponin C has only one Ca2+-specific binding site. A theoretical model for these observations is described and related to the experimental data. Well-known interactions between neighboring troponin-tropomyosin complexes are the proposed source of cooperativity and also influence the overall Ka. The data indicate that Ca2+ is four times more likely to elongate a sequence of troponin-tropomyosin units already binding Ca2+ than to bind to a site interior to a sequence of units without Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1675434586,"Nucleotide binding to sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was investigated in the absence of calcium using both filtration and fluorescence measurements. Filtration assays of binding of radioactive nucleotides at concentrations up to 0.1 mM gave a stoichiometry of one ATP-binding site/sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase molecule. When measured in the presence of calcium under otherwise similar conditions, ATPase velocity rose 4-8-fold (depending on pH and magnesium concentration) when the ATP concentration was increased from 1 microM to 0.1 mM. Binding of ATP and ADP enhanced the intrinsic fluorescence of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase, but AMP and adenosine did not affect it. Both filtration and fluorescence measurements showed that binding of metal-free ATP is independent of pH (Kd = 20-25 microM) but that the presence of magnesium induces pH dependence of the binding of the Mg.ATP complex (Kd = 10 microM at pH 6.0 and 1.5 microM at pH 8.0). Binding of metal-free ADP was pH-dependent but was not affected by magnesium. High magnesium concentrations inhibited nucleotide binding. These results suggest that ATP interacts with two different domains of Ca-ATPase that form the catalytic site. The first domain may bind the adenine moiety of the substrate, and the pH dependence of ADP binding suggests the participation of His683 in this region. The second domain of the catalytic site may bind the gamma-phosphate and the magnesium ion of the Mg.ATP complex and constitute the locus of the electrostatic interactions between the substrate and the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1515311330,"Treatment of Ca2(+)-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum with V8 protease from Staphylococcus aureus produced appreciable amounts of a Ca2(+)-ATPase fragment (p85) in the presence of Ca2+ (E1 conformation of the enzyme), along with many other peptide fragments that were also formed in the presence of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (E2 conformation). p85 was formed as a carboxyl-terminal cleavage product of Ca2(+)-ATPase by a split of the peptide bond between Glu-231 and Ile-232. Other conformation-dependent V8 splits were localized to the hinge region, involved in ATP binding, between the middle and COOH-terminal one-third of the Ca2(+)-ATPase polypeptide chain. Representative split products in this region (p48,p31) were identified as NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal cleavage products of p85. In the membrane p85 probably remains associated with its complementary NH2-terminal fragment(s) and retains the capacity to bind Ca2+ as evidenced by resistance to V8 degradation in Ca2+ and ability to become phosphorylated by ATP. However, the hydrolysis rate of the phosphorylated enzyme is reduced, indicating that peptide cleavage at Glu-231 interferes with Ca2+ transport steps after phosphorylation. Binding of Ca2+ to V8 and tryptic fragments of Ca2(+)-ATPase was studied on the basis of Ca2(+)-induced changes in electrophoretic mobility and 45Ca2+ autoradiography after transfer of peptides to Immobilon membranes. These data indicate binding by the NH2-terminal 1-198 amino acid residues (corresponding to the tryptic A2 fragment) and the COOH-terminal 715-1001 amino acid residues (corresponding to p31). By contrast the central portion of Ca2(+)-ATPase, including the NH2-terminal portion of p85, is devoid of Ca2+ binding. These results question an earlier proposition that Ca2(+)-binding is located to the stalk region of Ca2(+)-ATPase (Brandl, C. J., Green, N. M., Korczak, B., and MacLennan, D. H.) (1986) Cell 44, 597-607) but are in agreement with recent data obtained by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of Ca2(+)-ATPase (Clarke, D. M., Loo, T. W., Inesi, G., and MacLennan, D. H. (1989) Nature 339, 476-478). These different studies suggest that Ca2+ translocation sites may have an intramembranous location and are formed predominantly by the carboxyl-terminal part of the Ca2(+)-ATPase polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1766711268,"The adaptation of a slow (soleus, Sol) and a fast (medial gastrocnemius, MG) skeletal muscle to spaceflight was studied in five young male rats. The flight period was 12.5 days and the rats were killed approximately 48 h after returning to 1 g. Five other rats that were housed in cages similar to those used by the flight rats were maintained at 1 g for the same period of time to serve as ground-based controls. Fibers were classified as dark or light staining for myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). On the average, the fibers in the Sol of the flight rats atrophied twice as much as those in the MG. Further, the fibers located in the deep (close to the bone and having the highest percentage of light ATPase and high oxidative fibers in the muscle cross section) region of the MG atrophied more than the fibers located in the superficial (away from the bone and having the lowest percentage of light ATPase and high oxidative fibers in the muscle cross-section) region of the muscle. Based on quantitative histochemical assays of single muscle fibers, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity per unit volume was unchanged in fibers of the Sol and MG. However, in the Sol, but not the MG, the total amount of SDH activity in a 10-microns-thick section of a fiber decreased significantly in response to spaceflight. Based on population distributions, it appears that the alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) activities were elevated in the dark ATPase fibers in the Sol, whereas the light fibers in the Sol and both fiber types in the MG did not appear to change. The ratio of GPD to SDH activities increased in the dark (but not light) fibers of the Sol and was unaffected in the MG. Immunohistochemical analyses indicate that approximately 40% of the fibers in the Sol of flight rats expressed a fast myosin heavy chain compared with 22% in control rats. Further, 31% of the fibers in the Sol of flight rats expressed both fast and slow myosin heavy chains compared with 8% in control rats. Immunohistochemical changes in the MG were minimal. These data suggest that the magnitude and direction of enzymatic activity and cell volume changes are dependent on the muscle, the region of the muscle, and the type of myosin expressed in the fibers. Further, the ability of fibers to maintain normal or even elevated activities per unit volume of some metabolic enzymes is remarkable considering the marked and rapid decrease in fiber volume."
https://openalex.org/W1554777057,"Mitochondrial uncoupling is often invoked as a mechanism underlying cellular dysfunction; however, it has not been possible to study this phenomenon directly in intact cells and tissues. In this paper, we report direct evaluation of mitochondrial uncoupling in the intact myocardium using 31P NMR magnetization transfer techniques. Langendorff perfused rat hearts were exposed to either a known uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), or a potential uncoupler, octanoate. Both DNP and octanoate decreased mechanical function as measured by the rate pressure product and caused an increase in the oxygen consumption rate (MVO2); with DNP this increase in MVO2 was dose-dependent. The ATP synthesis rate measured by 31P NMR, however, was not elevated commensurately with MVO2; instead, the P/O ratio declined. In contrast, the linear relationship between the ATP synthesis rate and rate pressure product was not altered by the uncoupling agents. These data demonstrate that 1) 31P NMR magnetization transfer can be utilized to measure uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in intact organs, 2) octanoate does not induce excess ATP utilization in the intact heart, and 3) high levels of octanoate induce mitochondrial uncoupling in the intact myocardium; and this may, in part, be the cause of the toxic effects associated with fatty acid exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1506287904,"Activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) by the aggregation of receptors for immunoglobulin E (IgE) can be studied in streptolysin O-permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia cells. Under these conditions, 40 microM guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) stimulates PLA2 activity 5-6-fold when free Ca2+ concentrations are buffered at 10(-7)-10(-5) M. Antigen-mediated cross-linking of receptors for IgE synergizes with low concentrations of GTP gamma S (0.1 microM) to cause similar stimulation. When the endogenous PLA2 activity is inactivated by chemical modification, we find that exogenously supplied PLA2 from porcine pancreas and Naja naja venom is also activated by the aggregation of cell-surface IgE receptors in these permeabilized cells. As with endogenous PLA2, GTP gamma S synergizes with IgE receptor-aggregation to activate exogenous PLA2 approximately 10-fold at 10(-7)-10(-6) M free Ca2+. These data indicate that receptor-mediated activation of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein can shift the Ca2+ dependence of PLA2 activity resulting in greatly enhanced activity at physiological concentrations of intracellular free Ca2+. The partial reconstitution of various PLA2 forms into such a broken-cell system offers a new approach for studying the mechanisms of G-protein-mediated activation of PLA2."
https://openalex.org/W1552224269,"Reconstituted proteoliposomes containing Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase molecules oriented predominantly with their cytoplasmic portion facing outward have been used to determine the location of the NH2 and COOH termini of the H+-ATPase relative to the lipid bilayer. Treatment of the proteoliposomes with trypsin in the presence of the H+-ATPase ligands Mg2+, ATP, and vanadate produces approximately 97-, 95-, and 88-kDa truncated forms of the H+-ATPase similar to those already known to result from cleavage at Lys24, Lys36, and Arg73 at the NH2-terminal end of the molecule. These results establish that the NH2-terminal end of the H+-ATPase polypeptide chain is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Treatment of the same proteoliposome preparation with trypsin in the absence of ligands releases approximately 50 water-soluble peptides from the proteoliposomes. Separation of the released peptides by high performance liquid chromatography and spectral analysis of the purified peptides identified only a few peptides with the properties expected of a COOH-terminal, tryptic undecapeptide with the sequence SLEDFVVSLQR, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis identified this peptide among the possible candidates. Quantitative considerations indicate that this peptide must have come from H+-ATPase molecules oriented with their cytoplasmic portion facing outward, and could not have originated from a minor population of H+-ATPase molecules of reverse orientation. These results directly establish that the COOH-terminal end of the H+-ATPase is also located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. These findings are important for elucidating the topography of the membrane-bound H+-ATPase and are possibly relevant to the topography of other aspartyl-phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate ATPases as well."
https://openalex.org/W1520546125,"The photoaffinity probe 5-azidouridine 5'-[beta-32P]diphosphate glucose (5N3[32P]UDP-Glc) was used to identify a 57-kDa polypeptide as a strong candidate for the UDP-Glc-binding polypeptide of UDP-glucose: (1,3)-beta-glucan (callose) synthase from red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) storage tissue. Unlabeled 5N3UDP-Glc was a competitive inhibitor of callose synthase with a Ki of 310 microM. Callose synthase was purified from plasma membranes by a two-step solubilization with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate, followed by product entrapment, and photoincorporation of radioactivity from 5N3[32P]UDP-Glc was used to identify UDP-Glc-binding polypeptides that copurified with callose synthase activity. Photoinsertion into the 57-kDa band was closely correlated with all catalytic properties examined. Photolabeling of the 57-kDa polypeptide was enriched upon purification of callose synthase by product entrapment, was abolished with increasing levels of unlabeled UDP-Glc, was dependent upon the presence of divalent cations, and the pH dependence of photolabeling correlated with the pH activity profile of callose synthase. In addition, photolabeling of the 57-kDa band did not occur after phospholipase treatment, which destroys enzyme activity. The extent of labeling of this polypeptide thus correlates closely with the activity of callose synthase under a wide variety of conditions. These results imply that the polypeptide at 57 kDa represents the substrate-binding and cation-regulated component of the callose synthase complex of higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W1611945579,"The mechanism for the potentiation of the actin-activated ATPase of smooth muscle myosin by tropomyosin is investigated using smooth muscle actin, tropomyosin, and heavy meromyosin. In the presence of tropomyosin, an increase in Vmax occurs with no effect on KATPase and Kbinding at 20 mM ionic strength. Utilizing N-ethylmaleimide-treated subfragment-1, which forms rigor complexes with actin in the presence of ATP but does not have ATPase activity, experiments were carried out to determine if the tropomyosin-actin complex exists in both the turned-off and turned-on forms as in the skeletal muscle system. At both 60 and 100 mM ionic strengths, the presence of rigor complexes on the smooth muscle actin filament containing bound tropomyosin causes a 2-3-fold increase in Vmax and about a 3-fold increase in KATPase, resulting in about a 4-fold increase in ATPase activity at moderate actin concentration. The increase in KATPase is correlated with an increase in Kbinding. The finding that rigor complexes increase Vmax and the binding constant for heavy meromyosin to tropomyosin-actin at an ionic strength close to physiological conditions indicates that the tropomyosin-actin complex can be turned on by rigor complexes in a cooperative manner. However, in contrast to the situation in the skeletal muscle system, the increase in KATPase is associated with a corresponding increase in Kbinding. Furthermore, there is only a 3-fold increase in KATPase in the smooth muscle system rather than a 10-fold increase as in the skeletal muscle system."

Reaction intermediates contain Holliday junctions that are driven along the DNA at a maximal rate approaching 1000 bases per minute. T4 endonuclease VII cleaves Holliday junctions in vitro, and its inclusion in RecA-mediated reactions leads to the rapid formation of heteroduplex products. Product analysis indicates patch and splice recombinant molecules similar to those expected from in vivo recombination events. The combined formation and resolution of Holliday junctions has led us to propose a model for resolution based on the structure of RecA-DNA helices. One feature of this model is that resolution, which gives rise to the two types of recombinant product, may occur without need for isomerization of the junction."
https://openalex.org/W1603323164,"The contribution of N-linked carbohydrates to human interferon-gamma receptor (hIFN-gamma-R) structure and function was investigated in four tumor cell lines of various tissue origin. Western and ligand blotting of native and deglycosylated, affinity-purified hIFN-gamma-R of the monocytic cell line U937 and the lymphoid cell line Raji revealed that the different sizes of hIFN-gamma-R from U937 (103 kDa) and Raji (90 kDa) cells are reduced upon either metabolic inhibition or enzymatic deglycosylation of N-linked carbohydrates to a common size of the receptor molecule with an apparent molecular mass of 73 kDa for both cell lines, indicating that heterogeneity in hIFN-gamma-R size is largely due to differential glycosylation. In all cell lines investigated, inhibition of N-linked glycosylation or modulation of carbohydrate processing did not prevent receptor transport to the cell membrane, but blocked hIFN-gamma binding capacity of membrane-expressed receptor molecules, as revealed by specific binding of hIFN-gamma-R-specific monoclonal antibody and specific binding of 125I-labeled hIFN-gamma. These data suggest that a lack of complex-type N-linked carbohydrates is associated with a complete loss of receptor function, i.e. high affinity binding capacity. Recovery of hIFN-gamma binding of deglycosylated receptors was achieved upon affinity purification and adsorption to nitrocellulose membranes, indicating that the carbohydrate side chains themselves do not directly contribute to the ligand binding epitope but seem to be essential for appropriate conformation of the receptor protein in the cell membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1542272425,"Rabbit liver alpha 1,2-mannosidase is a calcium ion requiring enzyme involved in processing the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. Ca2+ activation occurs with an apparent Ka of 1.1 microM. The major effect of the metal ion activator is on Km rather than Vmax. The kinetic mechanism of the enzyme is that of an ordered equilibrium in which Ca2+ must bind before substrate and the metal ion cannot release once the substrate has added to the enzyme. Several other divalent cations including Co2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ were competitive with Ca2+ and inhibited the enzyme. Significantly, Mg2+ had no effect on enzyme activity. 1-Deoxymannojirimycin and Tris, which inhibit glycoprotein processing in vivo, are inhibitors of the mannosidase competitive with substrate. The effect of Ca2+ on the affinity of the enzyme for substrate may be a determinant in regulation of enzyme activity in vivo."

A protocol has been developed for the fractionation and purification of these activities. We report here the purification from HeLa nuclear extracts of a novel 120-kDa polypeptide which by Southwestern blots, gel retardation, and UV cross-linking assays displays CRE-specific binding. The CRE-affinity purified 120-kDa protein displays properties distinct from those of the 43-kDa CREB/ATF polypeptide. The 120-kDa protein is readily phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C but not by protein kinase A, suggesting that this molecule may mediate cellular signals distinct from the cAMP-responsive pathway. In vitro transcription-complementation assays utilizing the purified 120-kDa protein failed to transactivate the cAMP-responsive somatostatin promoter suggesting that the mode of action of this 120-kDa polypeptide may require an activation step distinct from the cAMP-signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2138743589,"[Cys374]glutathionyl-actin was prepared by isolation of the reaction product of G-actin with Ellman's reagent (5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid], followed by reaction with glutathione. Filaments of this actin disulfide are susceptible to even weak shearing stress as exerted, for example, by heating to 37 degrees C. This treatment produces a 25-fold enhanced steady-state ATPase activity as compared to unsubstituted F-actin at room temperature. Monitoring the reduction of this enhanced ATPase activity is a reliable method for quantifying the effectiveness of filament-stabilizing agents and for determining their apparent dissociation constants. A detailed comparative study of filament-stabilizing agents was performed, and some hitherto unknown filament-protecting effects were revealed. Inorganic phosphate provides stabilization only to a maximum of 45% ATPase inhibition, but reaches this effect already at cytoplasmic Pi concentrations (approximately 4 mM). Arsenate seems to bind with similar affinity, but with distinctly less protective activity (maximum of 16%). High concentrations of alkali ions provide a more effective protection (maximum of 95%), Li+ being more efficient than Na+ and K+. Divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+) had a strong stabilizing effect on KCl-polymerized actin; we confirmed the presence of two distinct classes of binding sites for divalent metal ions with moderate and low affinities, apparent in a strong stabilizing effect on KCl-polymerized actin. The stabilizing effects of KCl and Pi are independent and additive. Correspondingly, at K2HPO4 concentrations greater than 4 mM, K+ ions contribute considerably to stabilization. In the presence of 100 mM KCl plus 4 mM Pi, conditions which mimic the physiological environment, filament protection is nearly as effective as with the mushroom toxin phalloidin. The strong stabilizing effect of phalloidin occurred at concentrations far below stoichiometric, suggesting a very high degree of cooperativity in its interaction with actin filaments."

A. 86, 6484-6487) from the isolated alpha and beta subunits of the F1-ATPase of the thermophilic bacterium PS3 (TF1), is inactivated by 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzofurazan (Nbf-Cl) with characteristics very similar to those observed when TF1, which has the subunit composition, alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta epsilon, is inactivated by the reagent under the same conditions. Both native TF1 and the alpha 3 beta 3 complex are inactivated by 200 microM Nbf-Cl with a pseudo-first order rate constant of 3.7 x 10(-2) min-1 in the presence of 0.2 M Na2SO4 at pH 7.6 and 23 degrees C. The rate of increase in absorbance at 385 nm of reaction mixtures containing 200 microM [14C]Nbf-Cl and TF1, the wild-type alpha 3 beta 3 complex, or the mutant alpha 3(beta Y307----F)3 complex, each at 18 microM was also examined. Since the alpha 3(beta y307----F)3 complex is resistant to inactivation by Nbf-Cl, difference spectrophotometry revealed that inactivation of native TF1 and the wild-type alpha 3 beta 3 complex could be correlated with formation of about 1 mol of Nbf-O-Tyr/mol of enzyme or complex. Fractionation of peptic digests of the labeled enzyme and complexes by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography resolved a major radioactive peptide that was common to labeled TF1 and the labeled alpha 3 beta 3 complex but was absent in the digest of the labeled alpha 3(beta Y307----F)3 complex. This labeled peptide was shown to contain Tyr-beta 307 derivatized with [14C]Nbf-Cl by automatic amino acid sequence analyses. From these results, it is concluded that one-third of the sites' reactivity of Nbf-Cl with Tyr-beta 307 in TF1 or its equivalent in other F1-ATPases is not influenced by the presence of the gamma, delta, or epsilon subunits. It has also been shown that Tyr-307 is not modified to an appreciable extent when the isolated beta subunit is treated with [14C]Nbf-Cl under conditions in which this residue is nearly completely labeled in a single beta subunit when TF1 or the alpha 3 beta 3 complex is inactivated by the reagent."
https://openalex.org/W1592800434,"In bacterial D-amino acid transaminase, Lys-145, which binds the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in Schiff base linkage, was changed to Gln-145 by site-directed mutagenesis (K145Q). The mutant enzyme had 0.015% the activity of the wild-type enzyme and was capable of forming a Schiff base with D-alanine; this external aldimine was formed over a period of minutes depending upon the D-alanine concentration. The transformation of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate form of the enzyme to the pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate form (i.e. the half-reaction of transamination) occurred over a period of hours with this mutant enzyme. Thus, information on these two steps in the reaction and on the factors that influence them can readily be obtained with this mutant enzyme. In contrast, these reactions with the wild-type enzyme occur at much faster rates and are not easily studied separately. The mutant enzyme shows distinct preference for D- over L-alanine as substrates but it does so about 50-fold less effectively than the wild-type enzyme. Thus, Lys-145 probably acts in concert with the coenzyme and other functional side chain(s) to lead to efficient and stereochemically precise transamination in the wild-type enzyme. The addition of exogenous amines, ethanolamine or methyl amine, increased the rate of external aldimine formation with D-alanine and the mutant enzyme but the subsequent transformation to the pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate form of the enzyme was unaffected by exogenous amines. The wild-type enzyme displayed a large negative trough in the circular dichroic spectrum at 420 nm, which was practically absent in the mutant enzyme. However, addition of D-alanine to the mutant enzyme generated this negative Cotton effect (due to formation of the external aldimine with D-alanine). This circular dichroism band gradually collapsed in parallel with the transformation to the pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate enzyme. Further studies on this mutant enzyme, which displays the characteristics of the wild-type enzyme but at attenuated rates, may yield information on the factors controlling the stereochemistry of the reaction as well as on the catalytic steps of the transaminase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1483677531,"Incubation of human high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (density = 1.063-1.21 g/ml) with catalytic amounts of Manduca sexta lipid transfer particle (LTP) resulted in alteration of the density distribution of HDL protein such that the original HDL particles were transformed into new particles with an equilibrium density = 1.05 g/ml. Concomitantly, substantial amounts of protein were recovered in the bottom fraction of the density gradient. The LTP-induced alteration in HDL protein density distribution was dependent on the LTP concentration and incubation time. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that the lower density fraction contained apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) as the major apoprotein component while nearly all of the apoA-I was recovered in the bottom fraction. Lipid analysis of the HDL substrate and product fractions revealed that the apoA-I-rich fraction was nearly devoid of lipid (less than 1%, w/w). The lipid originally associated with HDL was recovered in the low density, apoA-II-rich, lipoprotein fraction, and the ratios of individual lipid classes were the same as in control HDL. Electron microscopy and gel permeation chromatography experiments revealed that the LTP-induced product lipoprotein population comprised particles of larger size (19.7 +/- 1.4-nm diameter) than control HDL (10.6 +/- 1.4-nm diameter). The results suggest that facilitated net lipid transfer between HDL particles altered the distribution of lipid such that apoprotein migration occurred and donor particles disintegrated. Similar results were obtained when human HDL3 or HDL2 density subclasses were employed as substrates for LTP. The lower surface area to core volume ratio of the larger, product lipoprotein particles compared with the substrate HDL requires that there be a decrease in the total exposed lipid/water interface which requires stabilization by apolipoprotein. Selective displacement of apoA-I by apoA-II or apoC, due to their greater surface binding affinity, dictates that apoA-I is preferentially lost from the lipoprotein surface and is therefore recovered as lipid-free apoprotein. Thus, it is conceivable that the structural arrangement of HDL particle lipid and apoprotein components isolated from human plasma may not represent the most thermodynamically stable arrangement of lipid and protein."

https://openalex.org/W1607992997,"Photoaffinity labeling of the active site of the yeast plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase has been studied with 2-azido-AMP and 2-azido-ATP. The ATPase activity of the enzyme decreases as the time of photolysis of the photoactive nucleotides in the presence of the enzyme increases. The covalent incorporation of [alpha-32P]2-azido-AMP into the enzyme and the inhibition of ATPase activity have comparable time courses. ATP protects the ATPase from incorporation of and photoinactivation by 2-azido-ATP or 2-azido-AMP. In the dark, 2-azido-ATP inhibits the ATPase at concentrations comparable to the apparent Michaelis constant for MgATP. After photolysis and proteolysis of the protein, three overlapping peptides labeled by the nucleotide analogues were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced. The peptides are derived from a region of the ATPase that is highly conserved in related cation pumps forming a phosphorylated intermediate during the catalytic cycle. Labeling with both nucleotide analogues occurs in peptides containing residues from aspartate 560 to lysine 566. The amino acids in this region conform to a consensus sequence for ATP binding derived from phosphofructokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1515928259,"Irradiation of outer arm dynein ATPase from sea urchin sperm tail flagella at 365-410 nm in the presence of Fe(III)-gluconate complex and ATP produces photolytic cleavage at two distinct sites on the beta heavy chain, located approximately 250 and approximately 230 kDa from its amino terminus. The former cut is close to or identical with the V1 site of the vanadate-mediated photocleavage (Gibbons, I.R., Lee-Eiford, A., Mocz, G., Phillipson, C. A., Tang, W.-J.Y., and Gibbons, B.H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2780-2786. The rate of photolysis shows a hyperbolic dependence on Fe(III)-gluconate concentration with half-maximal rate occurring at 23 microM at pH 6.3. In the presence of 0.1-0.5 mM Fe(III)-gluconate-ATP, approximately 58% of the beta chain becomes cleaved with a half-time of about 34 s; the remainder of the beta chain and almost all of the alpha chain are resistant to cleavage. This photolytic cleavage of the beta chain is accompanied by an approximately parallel loss of the dynein latent ATPase activity, whereas the Triton-activated ATPase is lost to a somewhat greater extent. Mg2+ concentrations above approximately 3 mM inhibit photolysis. Substitution of ADP for ATP changes the pattern of cleavage so that both the alpha and beta heavy chain undergo scission but at the 250-kDa site only. AMP, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate and Fe(II) do not support cleavage at either site. Trivalent rhodium-ATP complexes, as models of MgATP, can also catalyze photolysis of the beta chain at the 250-kDa site. These results suggest that photolysis results from the activation of an Fe(III)-ATP complex bound to the hydrolytic ATP binding site of the beta chain and that both Fe(III) cleavage sites are located close to the nucleotide binding site in the tertiary folding of the beta heavy chain. The cleavage reaction possibly involves initial photoreduction of Fe(III) bound at the Mg2+ binding site in the dynein.Fe.ATP complex, followed by covalent modification of an amino acid side chain that leads to eventual peptide scission."
https://openalex.org/W1545322097,"The electrogenicity and some molecular properties of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump protein were studied by measuring steady-state Ca2+ pump currents. Ca2(+)-ATPase protein was solubilized from rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane preparations and purified by liquid chromatography. The purified Ca(+)-ATPase molecules were reconstituted into proteoliposomes and then incorporated by fusion into a planar bilayer lipid membrane. Short circuit currents across the planar membrane were detected when the ATPase molecules were activated by addition of ATP under optimal ionic conditions. Thus, the electrogenicity of the Ca2+ pump molecules was directly demonstrated. The amplitude of the pump current was dependent on the ATP concentration, and the relation was described by a Michaelis-Menten-type equation. The Michaelis constant was calculated to be 0.69 +/- 0.16 mM, which agrees well with the dissociation constant for a low affinity ATP-binding site deduced previously from the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis and from ATP binding."
https://openalex.org/W1545482988,Phosphate and phosphate-containing buffers of physiological interest such as ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate were found to enhance catalysis by human carbonic anhydrase III (HCA III). Addition of phosphate caused an increase in both the catalyzed rate of hydration of CO2 at steady state measured by stopped-flow spectrophotometry and the exchange of 18O between CO2 and water at chemical equilibrium measured by mass spectrometry. The results are consistent with a mechanism in which phosphate enhances the transfer of protons between zinc-bound water at the active site and solution. Site-directed mutations to replace lysine 64 and arginine 67 in the active-site cavity resulted in greater enhancement by phosphate when compared with wild-type HCA III and showed that these basic residues are not essential as a binding site for phosphate. Phosphate did not enhance catalysis by HCA II.
https://openalex.org/W1936037573,"The first ATP-dependent complex formed in pre-mRNA splicing is the prespliceosome, a 30 S complex. This reaction was investigated using partially purified fractions isolated from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells. Previous studies (Furneaux, H. M., Perkins, K. K., Freyer, G. A., Arenas, J., and Hurwitz, J. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 4351-4355) have shown that DEAE-cellulose chromatography of nuclear extracts yielded two fractions (fractions I and II, eluted at 0.2 and 1 M NaCl, respectively) which carried out pre-mRNA splicing only when combined. Fraction II, alone and in the presence of ATP, supported the formation of the 30 S complex. In this report, we have separated fraction II into ribonucleoprotein and protein-rich fractions by isopycnic banding in CsCl. The combination of these two fractions completely replaced fraction II in prespliceosome formation; when supplemented with fraction Ib (1 M NaCl Biorex fraction derived from fraction I), the preparations supported spliceosome formation; when supplemented with fraction I, they yielded spliced products. The CsCl fractions, like fraction II, efficiently converted pre-mRNA to the 30 S complex with high yields (30-70%). The 30 S complex was shown to contain pre-mRNA complexed to U2 small ribonucleoproteins and small amounts of U1 small ribonucleoproteins. The 30 S complex protected a 50-nucleotide region at the 3'-end of the intron from T1 RNase attack. This region included sequences spanning the branch site, the polypyrimidine stretch and the AG dinucleotide of the 3'-splice site. When the 30 S complex was first generated with partially purified fractions, followed by the addition of a large amount of poly(U) or unlabeled pre-mRNA, the 30 S complex could be chased into a 55 S spliceosome complex by the addition of fraction Ib. These results support the conclusion, initially derived from kinetic data, that the 30 S complex is a precursor of the 55 S complex."

The T. pyriformis mitochondrial genome contains two copies of the LSU alpha.beta gene complex, and we have previously provided evidence that both copies are transcribed (Heinonen, T. Y. K., Schnare, M. N., Young, P. G., and Gray, M. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2879-2887). We now report the complete sequences of the two copies of the LSU alpha.beta gene complex. These are not identical, but differ at 5 out of the 2595 positions by single nucleotide substitutions in one sequence relative to the other. In the secondary structure model we propose here, two of these differences are located in base-paired regions of the LSU rRNA; however, they do not interrupt the complementary interactions in these helices. The other three differences occur in single-stranded regions of the secondary structure. The base substitutions documented here are not localized to those regions of LSU rRNA that are the most highly conserved in global phylogenetic comparisons, and therefore it seems unlikely that they are of fundamental functional significance. Whether they might exert more subtle effects on ribosome function remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1611171258,"Bacterial periplasmic transport systems require the function of a specific substrate-binding protein, located in the periplasm, and several cytoplasmic membrane transport components. In Escherichia coli K-12, the arginine-ornithine transport system requires an arginine-ornithine-binding protein and the lysine-arginine-ornithine (LAO) transport system includes a LAO-binding protein. Both periplasmic proteins can be phosphorylated by a single kinase. The enzyme exhibits a kinase activity and an ATPase activity. A mutant, defective in the phosphorylation of the arginine-ornithine and the LAO periplasmic proteins, was isolated and characterized. The defective enzymatic activity was reflected in substantially reduced levels of transport activity of the periplasmic transport systems that include each of the binding proteins. The binding proteins, extracted from the mutant, showed no detectable alterations in terms of quantity, electrophoretic mobility, or affinity constants. An apparent Km value of 1.0 mM was calculated for the ATPase activity of the defective enzyme. The ATPase activity of the wild-type enzyme yielded an apparent Km value of 50 microM. The amount of inorganic phosphate incorporated in vivo and in vitro into the binding proteins by the activity of the defective kinase was reduced to very low levels. A structural gene for the phosphorylating enzyme was located near the serA marker on the linkage map of E. coli. These results indicate that phosphorylation of the periplasmic transport protein is obligatorily linked to the normal function of the periplasmic transport system."

Biol. Chem. 263, 1030-1036) to the two major forms of link protein in bovine articular cartilage. Resistance to endoglycosidases H and F suggests that Asn-linked oligosaccharides of link protein secreted by bovine chondrocytes in culture are of the complex or hybrid type. There is no evidence for O-linked oligosaccharides. There is no apparent precursor-product relationship between link protein (LP)1 and LP2, since after a short pulse with [3H]leucine two forms are present, consistent with the existence of two glycosylation sites. An immunoprecipitate of LP1 from pulse-labeled chondrocytes was observed to show a decrease in electrophoretic mobility and increased microheterogeneity during transit through the Golgi, whereas LP2 did not change. During processing both LP1 and LP2 become endoglycosidase H resistant. LP1, but not LP2, can be biosynthetically labeled with [35S]sulfate. Incorporation of [35S]sulfate is inhibited by tunicamycin, indicating that the sulfate is associated with Asn-linked carbohydrate. Sulfation may be important for normal processing, secretion, or degradation of link protein and with sialylation may confer considerable charge heterogeneity upon LP1. We conclude that there are considerable biochemical differences between glycoproteins LP1 and LP2 which may provide a basis for functional differences."

The oxygen exchange distributions for ATP and Pi release fit a simple kinetic model with a single set of rate constants for each step. For actomyosin subfragment 1 (20 degrees C, pH 7.0, I = 50 mM), the rate constant governing ATP release is approximately 8 s-1, Pi release is at approximately 60 s-1 and Pi rebinds to an ADP state at greater than 120 M-1 s-1. These rate constants are similar to those that may occur for undistorted cross-bridges within glycerinated rabbit psoas fibers (Bowater, R., Webb, M. R., and Ferenczi, M. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7193-7201."
https://openalex.org/W1553036047,"Penicillium charlesii secretes a galactofuranosyl and phosphodiester-containing peptidophosphogalactomannan (pPGM). A linear mannan was prepared from pPGM by treatment with 48% aqueous HF which selectively cleaves galactofuranosyl and phosphodiesters; treatment with alkaline borohydride releases the mannan from the polypeptide. Mannan from P. charlesii cultured in D-[1,2-13C2]glucose contained mannopyranosyl residues which were enriched in 13C at both C-1 and C-2 and, to a lesser extent, at C-5 and C-6. The mannan was examined with a combination of 13C NMR INADEQUATE pulse sequence and selective 13C saturation to assign the resonance frequency of anomeric carbons directly coupled to specific C-2 signals. Three species of mannosyl residues, each substituted with a glycosidic linkage at C-2, and a fourth species substituted at C-6 and not substituted at C-2 were observed. Mannan obtained from P. charlesii cultured in D-[6-13C]glucose contained mannopyranosyl residues which were enriched in 13C primarily in C-6. The mannan was examined by DEPT 13C NMR to determine the number of species which were substituted at C-6. Mannan, treated as described above, contained a 1----6-linked mannopyranosyl species. pPGM contains minor quantities of at least four other substances attached to hydroxymethyl groups of the hexosyl residues."
