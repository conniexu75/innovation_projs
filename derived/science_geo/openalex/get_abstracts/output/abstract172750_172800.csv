The material is a tough solid at room temperature and below with mechanical properties equaling those of commercial epoxy resins. At temperatures above 120 degrees C, approximately 30% (as determined by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) of ""intermonomer"" linkages disconnect but then reconnect upon cooling, This process is fully reversible and can be used to restore a fractured part of the polymer multiple times, and it does not require additional ingredients such as a catalyst, additional monomer, or special surface treatment of the fractured interface."
https://openalex.org/W1998427002,"We report a method to generate steady coaxial jets of immiscible liquids with diameters in the range of micrometer/nanometer size. This compound jet is generated by the action of electro-hydrodynamic (EHD) forces with a diameter that ranges from tens of nanometers to tens of micrometers. The eventual jet breakup results in an aerosol of monodisperse compound droplets with the outer liquid surrounding or encapsulating the inner one. Following this approach, we have produced monodisperse capsules with diameters varying between 10 and 0.15 micrometers, depending on the running parameters."
https://openalex.org/W1759028523,"We have shown that thalidomide (Thal) and its immunomodulatory derivatives (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitor PS-341, and As2O3 act directly on multiple myeloma (MM) cells and in the bone marrow (BM) milieu to overcome drug resistance. Although Thal/IMiDs, PS-341, and As2O3 inhibit nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation, they also have multiple and varied other actions. In this study, we therefore specifically address the role of NF-κB blockade in mediating anti-MM activity. To characterize the effect of specific NF-κB blockade on MM cell growth and survival in vitro, we used an IκB kinase (IKK) inhibitor (PS-1145). Our studies demonstrate that PS-1145 and PS-341 block TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion in MM cells through inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, respectively. Dexamethasone (Dex), which up-regulates IκBα protein, enhances blockade of NF-κB activation by PS-1145. Moreover, PS-1145 blocks the protective effect of IL-6 against Dex-induced apotosis. TNFα-induced intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression on both RPMI8226 and MM.1S cells is also inhibited by PS-1145. Moreover, PS-1145 inhibits both IL-6 secretion from BMSCs triggered by MM cell adhesion and proliferation of MM cells adherent to BMSCs. However, in contrast to PS-341, PS-1145 only partially (20–50%) inhibits MM cell proliferation, suggesting that NF-κB blockade cannot account for all of the anti-MM activity of PS-341. Importantly, however, TNFα induces MM cell toxicity in the presence of PS-1145. These studies demonstrate that specific targeting of NF-κB can overcome the growth and survival advantage conferred both by tumor cell binding to BMSCs and cytokine secretion in the BM milieu. Furthermore, they provide the framework for clinical evaluation of novel MM therapies based upon targeting NF-κB.

Furthermore, they provide the framework for clinical evaluation of novel MM therapies based upon targeting NF-κB. NF-κB is a member of the Rel family of proteins and is typically a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 subunits (1.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). NF-κB is constitutively present in the cytosol and inactivated by its association with IκB family inhibitors (2.Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). IκBα is, therefore, a key molecular target regulating NF-κB activation.

Once phosphorylated, IκB is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (3.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), allowing translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of target genes and stimulates their transcription. The protein products of these genes include cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, and proteins mediating cellular growth control. Importantly, many of these proinflammatory proteins also act, either in an autocrine or paracrine fashion, to further stimulate NF-κB activation. tumor necrosis factor α multiple myeloma bone marrow stromal cell thalidomide immunomodulatory derivatives of thalidomide interleukin-6 IκB kinase dexamethasone intracellular adhesion molecule-1 vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase extracellular signal regulated kinases signal transducers and activators of transcription 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide electrophoretic mobility shift analysis antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protein kinase A c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase thymidine phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Many studies have reported growth and anti-apoptotic roles of NF-κB in normal and malignant cells. For example, NF-κB promotes cell growth by up-regulating cyclin D transcription, with associated hyperphosphorylation of Rb, G1- to S-phase transition, and inhibition of apoptosis (4.Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). NF-κB also regulates transcription of the catalytic subunit of telomerase in mice (5.Yin L. Hubbard A.K. Giardina C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36671-36675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). NF-κB is constitutively activated in Hodgkin's tumor cells, whereas inhibition of NF-κB blocks their growth (6.Bargou R.C. Emmerich F. Krappmann D. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Arnold W. Royer H.D. Grinstein E. Greiner A. Scheidereit C. Dorken B. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of NF-κB via expression of the super-repressor of IκBα induces apoptosis, even in the presence of an oncogenic allele of H-Ras (7.Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of NF-κB activation in pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) has not been fully characterized, we have previously shown that MM cell adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) induces NF-κB-dependent up-regulation of transcription of IL-6, a growth and anti-apoptotic factor in MM (8.Chauhan D. Uchiyama H. Akbarali Y. Urashima M. Yamamoto K.I. Libermann T.A. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1996; 87: 1104-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TNFα secreted by MM cells: 1) activates NF-κB in BMSCs, thereby directly up-regulating IL-6 transcription and secretion in BMSCs; and 2) activates NF-κB in MM cells, thereby up-regulating intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (CD54) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (CD106) expression on both MM cells and BMSCs and increasing MM cell to BMSC binding (9.Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Schlossman R. Richardson P. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4519-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Because IL-6 is the major growth and survival factor in MM cells (10.Borset M. Waage A. Brekke O.L. Helseth E. Eur. J.

We and others have shown that novel agents with both preclinical and early clinical anti-MM activity, including thalidomide (Thal) (15.Keifer J.A. Guttridge D.C. Ashburner B.P. Baldwin A.S.J. J.

However, these novel drugs also have multiple other biologic actions, and the benefit of specifically targeting NF-κB in novel MM therapeutics is not yet defined. In the present study, we demonstrate the specific biologic sequelae of NF-κB activation and blockade on MM cell growth and survival in the BM microenvironment. The novel specific IKK inhibitor PS-1145 inhibits phosphorylation of IκBα in MM cells and modestly directly inhibits their growth. Importantly, however, PS-1145 abrogates NF-κB activation related up-regulation of adhesion molecules on MM cells, MM cell to BMSC adherence, as well as the MM cell growth and survival advantage conferred both by adherence and cytokine secretion in the BM milieu. Furthermore, PS-1145 blocks the protective effect of IL-6 against apoptosis induced by both conventional (dexamethasone, Dex) and novel (immunomodulatory derivative of Thal 3, IMiD3) therapies. These studies therefore confirm a central role for NF-κB in regulating growth and survival of MM cells in the BM milieu and further suggest the potential utility of novel therapeutics targeting NF-κB in MM. The Dex-sensitive human MM cell line MM.1S was kindly provided by Dr. Steven Rosen (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). RPMI8226 and U266 human MM cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). All MM cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 2 μml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibeo, Grand Island, NY). Patient MM cells were purified from patient BM aspirates using RosetteSep separation system (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). The purity of MM cells was confirmed by flow cytometry using PE-conjugated anti-CD138 Ab (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). BM specimens were obtained from patients with MM. Mononuclear cells separated by Ficoll-Hypaque density sedimentation were used to established long term BM cultures, as previously described (20.Uchiyama H. Barut B.A. Mohrbacher A.F. Chauhan D. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1993; 82: 3712-3720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When an adherent cell monolayer had developed, cells were harvested in Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA, washed, and collected by centrifugation. A proteasome inhibitor PS-341 and an IKK inhibitor PS-1145 (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C until use. K i value of PS-1145 against the IKK complex was determined by measuring K m, ATP against varying fixed concentration of the inhibitor. Briefly, partially purified IKK complex obtained from unstimulated HeLa S3 cells were pre-activated using the catalytic domain of MEKK1 expressed in sf9. Kinase activity was assessed using a biotinylated IκBα peptide (250 μm, RHDSGLDSMKD,K m, peptide = 30 μm,K m, ATP = 10 μm) and phospho-[Ser32]-phosphoantibodies in an ELISA format with appropriate standard curve for quantification. For PS-1145K i measurement, the activated IKK complex was first preincubated in varying fixed concentration of the inhibitor (0.1–1 μm) at 25 °C for 1 h. Then apparentK m measurement for MgATP was performed at each discrete inhibitor concentration. Specificity of PS-1145 inhibition against IKK complex was demonstrated by testing PS-1145 against 14 kinases, including NF-κB-inducing kinase, PKA (protein kinase A), protein kinase C, casein kinase II, Src, Lck, calmodulin-dependent kinase 2, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase, p38α (known as stress-activated protein kinase 2α), MEK (MAPK kinases) 1/2, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2, ERK2 (extracellular signal regulated kinases), JNK2 (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 2), and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. Percentage inhibition of these kinases was negligible at PS-1145 (100 μm) (Table I). Target selectivity of PS-1145 was confirmed in the receptor binding and formation assays by NovaScreen (NovaScreen Bioscience, Hanover, MD) and Cerep (Cerep Inc., Redmond, WA). PS-341 and PS-1145 were diluted in culture medium immediately before use; PS-341 and PS-1145 control media contained <0.1% Me2SO. MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA).Table IInhibitory activity of PS-1145 on various kinasesKinaseIC50KinaseIC50μmμmIKK<0.1 (88 nm)IRAK>100NIK>100pp38α>100Protein kinase A>100MEK1>100Protein kinase C>100MAPKAP kinase 2>100Casein kinase II>100ERK2>100c-Src>100JNK2>100Lck>100EGF tyrosine kinase>100Calmodulin kinase>100 Open table in a new tab Proliferation was measured as previously described (21.Hideshima T.

MM cells (3 × 104cells/well) were incubated in 96-well culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in the presence of media, PS-341, PS-1145 and/or Dex or recombinant human IL-6 (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) for 48 h at 37 °C. DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine ([3H]TdR, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) uptake. Cells were pulsed with [3H]TdR (0.5 μCi/well) during the last 8 h of 48-h cultures. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The inhibitory effect of PS-341 and PS-1145 on MM growth was assessed by measuring 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye absorbance of the cells. Cells from 48-h cultures were pulsed with 10 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT to each well for the last 4 h of 48-h cultures, followed by 100 μl of isopropanol containing 0.04n HCl. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). MM cells were cultured with PS-341 or PS-1145, harvested, washed, and lysed using lysis buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. For detection of phospho-IκBα, IκBα, phospho-MAPK, phospho-STAT3, ERK2, or α-tubulin, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-IκBα, -IκBα, -phospho-MAPK, or -phospho-STAT3 Abs (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) Abs. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (EMSA) were carried out as in our previous studies (9.Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Schlossman R. Richardson P. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4519-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 18.Hideshima T. Richardson P. Chauhan D. Palombella V.J. Elliot P.J. Adams J. Anderson K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3071-3076PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MM.1S cells were preincubated with PS-341 (5 μm for 1 h) and PS-1145 (10 μm for 90 min) before stimulation with TNFα (5 ng/ml) for 10 or 20 min. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mmPMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin), and kept on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation (14,000 × g for 5 min) at 4 °C, the nuclear pellet was extracted with 100 μl of hypertonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation (14,000 × g for 5 min) at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected as nuclear extract. Double-stranded NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide probe (5′-GGGGACTTTCCC-3′, Santa Cruz Biotechnology.) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (50 μCi at 222 TBq/mm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Binding reactions containing 1 ng of oligonucleotide and 5 μg of nuclear protein were conducted at room temperature for 20 min in a total volume of 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol (v/v), and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Peapack, NJ). The samples were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Whatman paper (Whatman International, Maidstone, UK), and visualized by autoradiography. For cell cycle analysis, MM cells cultured for 24–48 h in PS-1145 (10 μm), or control media were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 70% ethanol, and treated with 10 μg/ml of RNase (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). Cells were then stained with propidium iodine (Sigma) (5 μg/ml). For detection of ICAM-1 expression, MM cells cultured with TNFα (5 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of PS-1145 (10 μm) were harvested, washed with PBS, and stained with mouse IgG isotype control or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-human CD54 Ab. Both cell cycle profile and ICAM-1 expression were determined using an Epics (Coulter Immunology, Hialeah, FL) flow cytometer, as in prior studies (9.Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Schlossman R. Richardson P. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4519-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). To evaluate growth stimulation and signaling in MM cells adherent to BMSCs, 3 × 104 MM.1S cells were cultured in BMSC coated 96-well plates for 48 h, in the presence or absence of PS-1145. DNA synthesis was measured as described above. The Duoset ELISA (R&D System) was used to measure IL-6 in supernatants of 48-h cultures of BMSCs with or without MM.1S cells, in the presence or absence of PS-1145. Statistical significance of differences observed in drug-treated versus control cultures was determined using the Student's t test. The minimal level of significance was p < 0.05. The effect of PS-1145, a novel specific IKK inhibitor (Fig. 1,A and B) on IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation in MM cells was first examined. Inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation by PS-1145 was assayed in MM.1S and patient MM cells triggered by TNFα. Serine phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα were significantly induced by TNFα at 5 and 10 min in cells cultured in Me2SO control media, whereas phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα were completely blocked by PS-1145 pre-treatment of MM.1S cells (Fig. 1 C). To study the dose-dependent effect of PS-1145, MM.1S cells were pre-treated with 1.25–40 μm PS-1145 for 90 min, and then stimulated by TNFα (5 ng/ml). Phosphorylation of IκBα was completely inhibited by ≥5 μm PS-1145 (Fig. 1 D). As in MM.1S cells, PS-1145 also inhibited phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα triggered by TNFα in patient MM cells (Fig. 1 E). These results demonstrate a time- and a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of PS-1145 on phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. Because NF-κB activation requires phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκBα, we next examined whether PS-1145 could inhibit NF-κB activation, assessed by EMSA. MM.1S cells pre-treated with either Me2SO control media or PS-1145 (10 μm for 90 min) were stimulated by TNFα (5 ng/ml for 0–20 min). NF-κB activation was completely inhibited by PS-1145 pre-treatment (Fig. 1 F). PS-341 served as a positive control for inhibition of NF-κB activation, as previously reported (9.Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Schlossman R. Richardson P. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4519-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar,18.Hideshima T. Richardson P. Chauhan D. Palombella V.J. Elliot P.J. Adams J. Anderson K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3071-3076PubMed Google Scholar). To study the direct effect of PS-1145 on MM cells, we measured [3H]TdR uptake by MM.1S, U266, and RPMI8226 cell lines cultured for 48 h in the presence of PS-1145 (1.5–50 μm). 20–50% inhibition in proliferation was observed at doses > 12.5 μm PS-1145 (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, PS-341 completely inhibited [3H]TdR uptake in all cell lines tested at IC50 of 0.02–0.005 (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that complete blockade of NF-κB activation cannot achieve >50% inhibition of DNA synthesis in MM cell lines and that complete inhibition by PS-341 is mediated through inhibition of another signaling pathway, such as p42/44 MAPK (22.Ogata A. Chauhan D. Teoh G. Treon S.P. Urashima M. Schlossman R.L. Anderson K.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2212-2221PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cycle profile, assessed by propidium iodine staining, was also examined in these MM cell lines. Interestingly, PS-1145 induced G1 growth arrest, but not apoptosis, in U266 cells (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were observed in RPMI8226 cells (data not shown). These data show that NF-κB blockade induces G1 growth arrest in MM cells. We have previously shown that IL-6 stimulates p42/44 MAPK, JAK2/STAT3, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in MM.1S cells (23.Hideshima T. Nakamura N. Chauhan D. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5991-6000Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and that PS-341 inhibits p42/44 MAPK, but not JAK2/STAT3 or PI3K/Akt, cascades triggered by IL-6 (18.Hideshima T. Richardson P. Chauhan D. Palombella V.J. Elliot P.J. Adams J. Anderson K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3071-3076PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 induces phosphorylation of both p42/44 MAPK and STAT3 in MM.1S cells, and the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 selectively inhibits p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 2 D). As in our prior report (18.Hideshima T. Richardson P. Chauhan D. Palombella V.J. Elliot P.J. Adams J. Anderson K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3071-3076PubMed Google Scholar), PS-341 also inhibits p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation; however, PS-1145 does not inhibit either p42/44 MAPK or STAT3 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Akt triggered by IL-6 was also unaffected by PS-1145 pre-treatment (data not shown). These results indicate that PS-1145 specifically blocks NF-κB, without affecting other known signaling pathways in MM.1S cells triggered by IL-6. We next determined whether PS-1145 enhances the inhibitory effect of Dex on NF-κB activation in MM.1S cells. Because Dex has been shown to up-regulate IκBα expression in monocytic cell lines and T cells (24.Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar), we first examined whether Dex could induce IκBα protein in MM cells. MM.1S cells were cultured in the presence of Dex (1 μm for 0–36 h), and expression of IκBα protein was assessed by Western blotting. Dex significantly induces IκBα expression, and IL-6 partially blocks Dex-induced up-regulation of IκBα (Fig. 3 A). NF-κB activation was next directly assayed in the presence of Dex, with or without IL-6. TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB in MM.1S cells is abrogated by pre-treatment with Dex (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, PS-1145 also inhibits NF-κB activation triggered by TNFα in MM.1S cells in a dose-dependent fashion, and pre-treatment with Dex enhances the inhibitory effect of PS-1145 (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that Dex inhibits NF-κB activation via up-regulation of IκBα, with related G1 growth arrest and apoptosis. The effect of Dex, PS-1145, PS-341, and/or IL-6 on TNFα-induced phosphorylation of IκBα in MM.1S cells was next examined. Dex, PS-341, and/or IL-6 do not inhibit TNFα-induced phosphorylation of IκBα; moreover, PS-341 enhances phosphorylation of IκBα, due to inhibition of proteasome activity and accumulation of IκBα (Fig. 3 D). In contrast, PS-1145, in the presence or absence of IL-6, inhibits phosphorylation of IκBα. Dex inhibits TNFα-induced degradation of IκBα, whereas IL-6 blocks this effect. Both PS-341 and PS-1145 inhibit degradation of IκBα, in the presence or absence of IL-6. To define the functional sequelae of PS-1145-related NF-κB blockade in MM.1S cells, we first examined its inhibitory effect on growth of MM cells, in the presence of Dex and/or IL-6. Dex inhibits IL-6-induced proliferation of MM.1S cells, but PS-1145 does not enhance its effect (Fig. 4 A). Importantly, both constitutive and IL-6-induced DNA synthesis in MM.1S cells is abrogated in the presence of PS-1145 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the protective effect of IL-6 on Dex-induced growth inhibition is also abrogated by PS-1145 (Fig. 4 C). These data suggest that promotion of cell growth and survival by IL-6 is mediated, at least in part, via NF-κB signaling. Because we have previously reported that the immunomodulatory derivative of Thal 3 (IMiD3) inhibits MM.1S cell growth and that IL-6 abrogates this IMiD effect (21.Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Shima Y. Raje N. Davies F.E. Tai Y.-T. Treon S. Lin B. Schlossman R.L. Ridhardson P. Muller G. Stirling D.I. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2943-2950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of PS-1145 on DNA synthesis of MM.1S cells treated with IMiD3, in the presence or absence of IL-6. IMiD3 significantly (p < 0.001) inhibits DNA synthesis in MM.1S cells in a dose-dependent fashion (0.25–1 μm, Fig. 4 D). IL-6 (20 ng/ml) overcomes the effect of IMiD3; importantly, however, PS-1145 neutralizes the inhibitory effect of IL-6 against IMiD3. These studies suggest that NF-κB blockade can overcome resistance to IMiDs. We have previously shown that TNFα induces ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression on both BMSCs and MM cells and that proteasome inhibitor PS-341 blocks induction of these molecules (9.Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Schlossman R. Richardson P. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4519-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Because PS-341 is not a specific NF-κB inhibitor, we cannot conclude from these earlier studies that TNFα-induced up-regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 is mediated through NF-κB. However, PS-1145 also inhibits TNFα-induced up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression on MM.1S and RPMI8226 cells (Fig. 5 A). This result strongly suggests that up-regulation of ICAM-1 by TNFα is mediated via activation of NF-κB. We have previously shown that TNFα induces modest proliferation, but not apoptosis, in MM.1S cells (9.Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Schlossman R. Richardson P. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4519-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In this study, we hypothesized that TNFα would induce apoptosis in MM.1S cells when NF-κB activation is blocked by PS-1145. To test this hypothesis, MM.1S cells were cultured with TNFα, in the presence or absence of PS-1145. TNFα treatment does not affect viability of MM.1S cells, assessed by MTT assay; however, in the presence of PS-1145, viability of the cells is significantly (p < 0.001) decreased (Fig. 5 B). For example, TNFα (1 ng/ml) induces 60% growth inhibition of MM.1S cells in the presence of 10 μmPS-1145. This effect on MM.1S viability is also confirmed by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). These studies suggest that NF-κB mediates protection of MM.1S cells against TNFα-induced apoptosis. To study the role of NF-κB activation in regulating IL-6 transcription and secretion, as well as related paracrine MM cell growth in the BM milieu, MM.1S cells were cultured with or without BMSCs, in the presence or absence of PS-1145. PS-1145 blocks constitutive secretion of IL-6 in BMSCs in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 6 A). Importantly, adhesion"
https://openalex.org/W2015557754,"The second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is the most important modulator of sympathetic control over cardiac contractility. In cardiac myocytes and many other cell types, however, cAMP transduces the signal generated upon stimulation of various receptors and activates different cellular functions, raising the issue of how specificity can be achieved. In the general field of signal transduction, the view is emerging that specificity is guaranteed by tight localization of signaling events. Here, we show that in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, beta-adrenergic stimulation generates multiple microdomains with increased concentration of cAMP in correspondence with the region of the transverse tubule/junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The restricted pools of cAMP show a range of action as small as approximately 1 micrometer, and free diffusion of the second messenger is limited by the activity of phosphodiesterases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such gradients of cAMP specifically activate a subset of protein kinase A molecules anchored in proximity to the T tubule."

Taken together, these data suggested proximity between receptors, which could allow them to form heteromeric complexes (directly or indirectly by means of adaptor proteins). In fact, A1R and D1R were found to form heteromeric complexes (6Ginés S. Hillion J. Torvinen M., Le Crom S. Casado V. Canela E.I. Rondin S. Lew J.Y. Watson S. Zoli M. Agnati L.F. Vernier P. Lluis C.

In the present work, the existence of selective intramembrane interactions between A2AR and D2R in neuronal cells is demonstrated, including formation of heteromeric A2AR/D2R complexes and their potential involvement in cross-desensitization mechanisms via agonist-induced coaggregation and cointernalization of A2AR and D2R. These results have clinical implications for Parkinson's disease and other basal ganglia disorders where dopamine D2R are the target for therapy (1Ferré S. Fredholm B.B. Morelli M. Popoli P. Fuxe K.

The formation of A2AR/D2R heteromers and aggregates is receptor subtype-specific because co-expression of A2AR/D1R (present study) or A1R/D2R (6Ginés S. Hillion J. Torvinen M., Le Crom S. Casado V.

This phenomenon may therefore constitute the molecular basis for the selective A2AR/D2R interactions observed in vitro, like A2AR modulation of D2 binding characteristics (7Salim H. Ferré S. Dalal A.

Owman C. Fredholm B.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and present paper). The same type of antagonism was observed in vivo with the A2AR inhibition of D2R-mediated regulation of GABA release in the globus pallidus and of D2R-mediated increases in motor activity (1Ferré S. Fredholm B.B. Morelli M. Popoli P. Fuxe K. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 482-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 5Fuxe K. Ferré S. Zoli M. Agnati L.F. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 258-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Besides acute antagonistic actions, the A2AR/D2R heteromers may be involved in receptor trafficking, because long term exposure to either A2AR or D2R agonists induces aggregation and cotreatment with these agonists induces internalization of both receptors. Moreover, prior exposure to A2AR or D2R agonists can produce a desensitization of the A2AR in terms of cAMP accumulation associated with coaggregation. In contrast, co-exposure to A2AR and D2R agonists, but not to any of the two agonists alone, causes desensitization of D2R-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation, which is associated with cointernalization. The present observation that A2AR and D2R functions are simultaneously altered after long exposure to agonists can aid in understanding behavioral findings involving cross-tolerance and cross-sensitization between dopamine agonists and compounds active at adenosine receptors (such as caffeine) (24Fenu S. Cauli O. Morelli M. Behav. Brain. Res. 2000; 114: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Garrett B.E. Holtzman S.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 262: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Together with other recently reported findings, the present results suggest that changes in A2AR function may be involved in the secondary effects observed after chronic intermittent treatment with l-DOPA such as reduced antiparkinsonian activity and dyskinesia (26Zeng B.Y. Pearce R.K. MacKenzie G.M. Jenner P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1096-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Adenosine is a feedback detector of neuronal activation, in view of the fact that it allows the neuronal network to return into a resting state (27Ferré S. Fuxe K. Prog. Brain Res. 2000; 125: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Adenosine is therefore expected to increase in the striatal extracellular fluid from patients with Parkinson's disease mainly after chronic intermittent l-DOPA treatment and in agreement with the evidence of increased striatal glutamate drive (28Chase T.N. Oh J.D. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: S86-S91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Hence, striatal extracellular levels of adenosine have been found to increase in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine model of Parkinson's disease (29Nomoto N. Kaseda S. Iwata S. Shimizu T. Fukuda T. Nakagawa S. J. Neurol. 2000; 247: V16-V22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the wearing off of the antiparkinsonian action of l-DOPA treatment may in part be caused by the simultaneous chronic activation of A2AR and D2R that, according to the present results, may lead to substantial cointernalization of both receptors. The coadministration of A2AR antagonists together with l-DOPA or dopamine D2R agonists may therefore provide a new therapeutic approach lacking the secondary effects of chronicl-DOPA treatment (30Kanda T.

This prompts development of adenosine and dopamine antagonists/agonists compounds preferentially active on A2AR/D2R heteromers as new drugs for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (30Kanda T.

The same type of antagonism was observed in vivo with the A2AR inhibition of D2R-mediated regulation of GABA release in the globus pallidus and of D2R-mediated increases in motor activity (1Ferré S.

Rev. 1998; 26: 258-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Besides acute antagonistic actions, the A2AR/D2R heteromers may be involved in receptor trafficking, because long term exposure to either A2AR or D2R agonists induces aggregation and cotreatment with these agonists induces internalization of both receptors. Moreover, prior exposure to A2AR or D2R agonists can produce a desensitization of the A2AR in terms of cAMP accumulation associated with coaggregation. In contrast, co-exposure to A2AR and D2R agonists, but not to any of the two agonists alone, causes desensitization of D2R-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation, which is associated with cointernalization. The present observation that A2AR and D2R functions are simultaneously altered after long exposure to agonists can aid in understanding behavioral findings involving cross-tolerance and cross-sensitization between dopamine agonists and compounds active at adenosine receptors (such as caffeine) (24Fenu S. Cauli O. Morelli M. Behav. Brain. Res. 2000; 114: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Garrett B.E. Holtzman S.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 262: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Together with other recently reported findings, the present results suggest that changes in A2AR function may be involved in the secondary effects observed after chronic intermittent treatment with l-DOPA such as reduced antiparkinsonian activity and dyskinesia (26Zeng B.Y. Pearce R.K. MacKenzie G.M. Jenner P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1096-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Adenosine is a feedback detector of neuronal activation, in view of the fact that it allows the neuronal network to return into a resting state (27Ferré S. Fuxe K. Prog. Brain Res. 2000; 125: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Adenosine is therefore expected to increase in the striatal extracellular fluid from patients with Parkinson's disease mainly after chronic intermittent l-DOPA treatment and in agreement with the evidence of increased striatal glutamate drive (28Chase T.N. Oh J.D. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: S86-S91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Hence, striatal extracellular levels of adenosine have been found to increase in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine model of Parkinson's disease (29Nomoto N. Kaseda S. Iwata S. Shimizu T. Fukuda T. Nakagawa S. J. Neurol. 2000; 247: V16-V22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the wearing off of the antiparkinsonian action of l-DOPA treatment may in part be caused by the simultaneous chronic activation of A2AR and D2R that, according to the present results, may lead to substantial cointernalization of both receptors. The coadministration of A2AR antagonists together with l-DOPA or dopamine D2R agonists may therefore provide a new therapeutic approach lacking the secondary effects of chronicl-DOPA treatment (30Kanda T.

The main findings of the present work are first that A2AR and D2R are colocalized and form heteromers in untreated neuronal cells and that they coaggregate upon long term exposure to either agonist. The formation of A2AR/D2R heteromers and aggregates is receptor subtype-specific because co-expression of A2AR/D1R (present study) or A1R/D2R (6Ginés S. Hillion J. Torvinen M., Le Crom S. Casado V.

https://openalex.org/W1983089513,"When bound by extracellular ligands, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) on the cell surface transmit critical signals to the cell interior. Although signal termination is less well understood, protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) is implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of several RTKs. However, PTP1B resides on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), so how and when it accesses RTKs has been unclear. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methods, we monitored interactions between the epidermal- and platelet-derived growth factor receptors and PTP1B. PTP1B-catalyzed dephosphorylation required endocytosis of the receptors and occurred at specific sites on the surface of the ER. Most of the RTKs activated at the cell surface showed interaction with PTP1B after internalization, establishing that RTK activation and inactivation are spatially and temporally partitioned within cells."

STO-609 inhibits the activities of recombinant CaM-KKα and CaM-KKβ isoforms, with Ki values of 80 and 15 ng/ml, respectively, and also inhibits their autophosphorylation activities. Comparison of the inhibitory potency of the compound against various protein kinases revealed that STO-609 is highly selective for CaM-KK without any significant effect on the downstream CaM kinases (CaM-KI and -IV), and the IC50 value of the compound against CaM-KII is ∼10 μg/ml. STO-609 inhibits constitutively active CaM-KKα (glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CaM-KK-(84–434)) as well as the wild-type enzyme. Kinetic analysis indicates that the compound is a competitive inhibitor of ATP. In transfected HeLa cells, STO-609 suppresses the Ca2+-induced activation of CaM-KIV in a dose-dependent manner. In agreement with this observation, the inhibitor significantly reduces the endogenous activity of CaM-KK in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at a concentration of 1 μg/ml (∼80% inhibitory rate).

Previous studies have demonstrated that two multifunctional CaM kinases, CaM-KI and -IV, are activated by phosphorylation of an activation loop Thr residue by an upstream CaM kinase kinase (CaM-KK) resulting in a large increase in catalytic efficiency (reviewed in Refs. 1Soderling T.R.

A recent study of transgenic mice carrying dominant negative CaM-KIV alleles that confer a defect in the phosphorylation of CREB indicates that these animals exhibit a disruption of late phase long term potentiation and that they are impaired in the consolidation/retention phase of hippocampus-dependent memory (27Kang H.

Analysis of mice deficient in CaM-KIV revealed that the CaM-KIV-mediated pathway plays an important role in the function and development of the cerebellum and is critical for male and female fertility (28Ribar T.J.

In addition, the physiological role has been predicted for CaM-KK, with the suggestion that it may act as a regulatory protein kinase in the CaM kinase cascade, but this has not been demonstrated in vivo. Therefore, to evaluate the physiological functions of CaM-KK and of the CaM kinase cascade, we attempted to synthesize a potent and specific inhibitor of CaM-KK. In this study, we characterize the effects of the inhibitor STO-609 on CaM-KK activity both in vitro and in intact cells. CaM-KKα cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number L42810) (3Tokumitsu H. Enslen H.

Rat CaM-KII holoenzyme was purified from rat forebrain as previously described (33Tokumitsu H. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mizutani A. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. J. Biol.

Purified myosin light chain kinase from chicken gizzard was kindly provided by Dr. Hiroshi Hosoya (Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan). cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C were obtained from CLONTECH. p42 MAP kinase was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. 1,8-Naphthoylene benzimidazole-3-carboxylic acid (STO-609, Mr = 314.29) was synthesized as follows. 3-Bromo-1,8-naphthoylene benzimidazole was prepared by the method of Nakaya et al.(37Nakaya K. Tanaka T. Shirataki Y. Shiozaki H. Funabiki K. Shibata K. Matsui M. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 2001; 74: 173-177Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Reaction of 3-bromo-1,8-naphthoylene benzimidazole with cuprous cyanide in pyridine, followed by acid hydrolysis of 3-cyano-1,8-naphthoylene benzimidazole with H2SO4 in aqueous acetic acid, yielded STO-609 as a yellow solid. Recrystallization from acetic acid yielded pure STO-609 as an acetic acid adduct in a molar ratio of 1:1. The structure and purity of the synthetic compound were confirmed by 1H NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Purified recombinant CaM-KKs (CaM-KKα, 0.28 μg/ml; CaM-KKβ, 0.52 μg/ml; constitutively active CaM-KK, 0.3 μg/ml) were incubated with 10 μg of GST-CaM-KI-(1–293)-K49E at 30 °C for 5 min in a solution (25 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, various concentrations (50–400 μm) of [γ-32P]ATP (650–6500 cpm/pmol) with various concentrations of STO-609 (0–10 μg/ml in Me2SO at a final concentration of 4%) in the presence of either 1 mm EGTA (for constitutively active CaM-KK) or 1 mm CaCl2, 2 μm CaM. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated by spotting aliquots (15 μl) onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P-81) followed by several washes with 75 mm phosphoric acid (34Roskowski R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 99: 3-6Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Phosphate incorporation into GST-CaM-KI-(1–293)-K49E was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the filters. A 5-min reaction was chosen to determine CaM-KK activity based on the time course experiment described recently (13Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Specific activities of CaM-KKα, CaM-KKβ, and constitutively active CaM-KK in the absence of STO-609 were calculated to be 723 ± 7 μmol/min/mg, 338 ± 18 μmol/min/mg, and 927 ± 40 μmol/min/mg, respectively. Purified recombinant CaM-KKα and -β (0.8 μg) were assayed at 30 °C for 5 min in a solution (25 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6500 cpm/pmol) with various concentrations of STO-609 (0–10 μg/ml in Me2SO at a final concentration of 4%) in the presence of either 1 mm EGTA (for CaM-KKα and CaM-KKβ) or 1 mmCaCl2, 2 μm CaM (for CaM-KKα). The reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-10% PAGE followed by autoradiography. 32P incorporation into CaM-KK was estimated by densitometric scanning of the x-ray film. CaM-KI (2.5 μg/ml), CaM-KII (0.75 μg/ml), CaM-KIV (9 μg/ml), and MLCK (0.6 μg/ml) were incubated with 40 μm syntide-2 or 50 μm MLC peptide (for MLCK) at 30 °C for 5 min in a solution (25 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4500 cpm/pmol) with various concentrations of STO-609 (0–10 μg/ml in Me2SO at a final concentration of 4%) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, 2 μm CaM. Protein kinase activity was measured by the phosphocellulose filter method as described above. Specific activities of CaM-KI, CaM-KII, CaM-KIV, and MLCK in the absence of STO-609 were calculated to be 24 ± 1 μmol/min/mg, 122 ± 3 μmol/min/mg, 48 ± 1 μmol/min/mg, and 178 ± 6 μmol/min/mg, respectively. PKA (8 μg/ml), PKC (25 ng/ml), and p42 MAP kinase (2 μg/ml) were incubated with 100 μm kemptamide (for PKA), 100 μm neurogranin peptide (for PKC, Promega), or 0.4 mg/ml myelin basic protein (for p42 MAP kinase) at 30 °C for 5 min in a solution (25 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4500 cpm/pmol) with various concentrations of STO-609 (0–10 μg/ml in Me2SO at a final concentration of 4%) in the absence (for PKA and p42 MAP kinase) or presence of 1 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Protein kinase activity was measured by the phosphocellulose filter method as described above. Specific activities of PKA, PKC and p42 MAP kinase in the absence of STO-609 were calculated to be 22 ± 1 μmol/min/mg, 7.522 ± 0.062 mmol/min/mg, and 181 ± 3 μmol/min/mg, respectively. Protein kinase activity was measured under linear conditions based on the results obtained from titration experiments for each enzyme. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were subcultured in 6-cm dishes 12 h before transfection. The cells were then transferred to serum-free medium and treated with a mixture of either 3 μg of pME18s plasmid DNA (DNAX Research Institute, Inc) or 3 μg of HA (hemagglutinin-tagged)-CaM-KIV and 20 μg of LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) in 2.5 ml of medium. After 20 h of incubation, the cells were further cultured in serum-free medium for 6 h in either the absence or presence of various concentrations of STO-609 (0.01–10 μg/ml in Me2SO at a final concentration of 0.5%) and then treated with or without 1 μm ionomycin for 5 min. Stimulation was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 10 mg/liter trypsin inhibitor, and 1 μm microcystin LR), and the cells were lysed for 30 min on ice. The cell extract was collected and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was precleared with 40 μl of Protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry, Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was mixed with 4 μg of anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3 h. 40 μl of Protein G-Sepharose was then applied to the extract and incubated overnight. The immunoprecipitated resin was washed three times with 1 ml of the lysis buffer as described above and then washed with 1 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 μm microcystin LR). Protein G-Sepharose with immunoprecipitated HA-CaM-KIV was subjected to the protein kinase assay (50 μl reaction volume) in the presence of 1 mm EGTA using syntide-2 as a substrate as described above. To estimate the amount of immunoprecipitated HA-CaM-KIV, SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 μl) was added to immunoprecipitated samples and then heated at 95 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, 10 μl of the sample was subjected to SDS-10% PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-CaM-KIV antibody (1:2000, Transduction Laboratories). Recombinant adenoviruses carrying cDNAs encoding Ca2+/CaM-independent CaM-KIV (305HMDT-DEDD) (32Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a kinase-deficient mutant (305HMDT-DEDD, K71E), or a constitutively active CaM-KK-(1–434) (3Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) were constructed as follows. Briefly, CaM-KIV mutants and constitutively active CaM-KK cDNAs in pME18s plasmid were digested, blunt-ended, and then ligated into pShuttle (CLONTECH). Recombinant viruses were obtained from HEK293 cells using the Adeno-X Expression System (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For virus infection, confluent SY5Y cells in 6-well culture plates were infected with viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell at 37 °C for 1 h. After infection, virus was aspirated, and the cells were further cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 12 h. The cells were then serum-starved for 6 h in either the absence or presence of various concentrations of STO-609 (0.01–10 μg/ml in Me2SO at a final concentration of 0.5%). The cells were stimulated with 1 μm ionomycin for 10 min (or not subjected to ionomycin treatment) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of STO-609 and then lysed, and the extract was subjected to SDS-7.5% PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-CaM-KIV antibody. The intensity of the immunoreactive band was measured by densitometric scanning of the x-ray film. Western blotting was performed as described previously (13Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a secondary antibody and chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for detection. Protein concentration was estimated by Coomassie dye binding (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. We have synthesized 1,8-naphthoylene benzimidazole-3-carboxylic acid (STO-609, Fig. 1A) to test its effects on CaM-KK kinase activity using GST-CaM-KI-(1–293)-K49E as a substrate and on the autophosphorylation activities of the CaM-KKα and -β isoforms. Fig. 1B shows that the CaM-KKα and -β kinase activities are inhibited by more than 80% in the presence of 1 and 0.1 μg/ml STO-609, respectively. It has been shown that CaM-KKα undergoes autophosphorylation in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner whereas the CaM-KK and autophosphorylation activities of CaM-KKβ are highly independent on Ca2+/CaM (5Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol.

We thus tested the inhibitory effect of STO-609 on the Ca2+/CaM-dependent autophosphorylation of CaM-KKα and the Ca2+/CaM-independent autophosphorylation of the β isoform. As shown in Fig. 1C, the autophosphorylation activities of both CaM-KK isoforms are inhibited by more than 80% in the presence of 1 μg/ml STO-609 with an IC50 value of ∼100 ng/ml, which is similar to the inhibitory effect of STO-609 on CaM-KK kinase activities, as shown in Fig. 1B. We have investigated the specificity of STO-609 for various protein kinases in the presence of 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The activities of multifunctional CaM kinases including the downstream kinases CaM-KI, -IV, and -KII, are unaffected or only slightly affected by the presence of 1 μg/ml STO-609 (CaM-KI, 6%; CaM-KII, 18% of inhibitory rate; CaM-KIV, not detected) (Fig.2). We further tested the inhibitory effects of STO-609 on other protein kinases such as protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and p42 MAP kinase in the presence of 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (TableI) and found that those protein kinases were only slightly affected by the presence of 10 μg/ml STO-609 (∼20% inhibitory rate). CaM-KII and MLCK are significantly inhibited (∼50% inhibitory rate) only by concentrations as high as 10 μg/ml STO-609, which represents an ∼100-fold or much lower inhibitory potency of the compound against these kinases than against the two CaM-KK isoforms (CaM-KKα, IC50 = 120 ng/ml; CaM-KKβ, IC50 = 40 ng/ml). These results indicate that STO-609 more significantly inhibits CaM-KKs than other protein kinases we tested. Thus, the newly synthesized compound STO-609 is a selective and potent inhibitor of CaM-KK.Figure 2Effect of STO-609 on the activities of multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases. Protein kinase activities of CaM-KI (open circle), CaM-KII (open triangle), CaM-KIV (open square), and CaM-KKα (closed circle) were measured at 30 °C for 5 min in the presence of 1 mmCaCl2, 2 μm CaM and 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP with various concentrations of STO-609 (0–10 μg/ml in Me2SO at a final concentration of 4%) as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are expressed as a percentage of the value of the activity in the absence of STO-609.

Open table in a new tab To clarify the mechanisms involved in the inhibition of CaM-KK activity, STO-609 was tested for its ability to inhibit a constitutively active mutant form of CaM-KKα (GST-CaM-KK-(84–434)), which lacks residues required for both autoinhibition and CaM binding (16Tokumitsu H. Muramatsu M. Ikura M. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20090-20095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, in the absence of Ca2+/CaM the activity of GST-CaM-KK-(84–434) is suppressed by the addition of STO-609 at exactly the same concentration that inhibits the wild type enzyme (IC50 ∼100 ng/ml). This result indicates that STO-609 targets the catalytic domain of CaM-KK and that it is not a CaM antagonist, like trifluoperazine, the interpretations that are also consistent with the inhibition of Ca2+/CaM-independent autophosphorylation of CaM-KKβ by STO-609 as shown in Fig.1C. Next we performed a kinetic analysis of the inhibition of CaM-KK isoforms by STO-609. Fig. 3B shows the degree of inhibition observed with varying concentrations of ATP (50–400 μm) in the absence or presence (0.1 or 1.0 μg/ml) of STO-609 for CaM-KKα (left panel) and in the absence or presence (0.01 or 0.1 μg/ml) of STO-609 for CaM-KKβ (right panel). As there is no change in the Vmaxvalue for the two CaM-KK isoforms, the apparent Kmvalue for ATP increases with increasing concentrations of STO-609, indicating that the inhibition is competitive with respect to ATP. Based on kinetic data, the Ki values of STO-609 were calculated to be 80 ng/ml for CaM-KKα and 15 ng/ml for CaM-KKβ. To examine the effect of STO-609 on the CaM kinase cascade in intact cells, we transfected into HeLa cells an expression vector carrying an HA-tagged CaM-KIV cDNA. Transfected HeLa cells were either untreated or treated with various concentration of STO-609 for 6 h prior to stimulation with 1 μm ionomycin for 5 min. HA-CaM-KIV was then immunoprecipitated, and its Ca2+/CaM-independent activity was measured (Fig.4). The Ca2+/CaM-independent activity of CaM-KIV has been shown to be generated by phosphorylation of Thr-196 by CaM-KK as well as induction of Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity (3Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 32Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17616-17621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The Ca2+/CaM-independent activity of immunoprecipitated HA-CaM-KIV was found to be greatly enhanced by stimulation with ionomycin, indicative of CaM-KK activity in HeLa cells. Ca2+-induced HA-CaM-KIV activation is suppressed by STO-609 in a dose-dependent manner. CaM-KIV activation in HeLa cells is inhibited by ∼90% by treatment with 10 μg/ml STO-609 whereas the level of expression of the HA-CaM-KIV protein is not altered by STO-609 treatment (Fig. 4, inset). This result suggests that STO-609 inhibits the endogenous activity of CaM-KK in HeLa cells resulting in a reduction of Ca2+-induced CaM-KIV activation. To confirm the cell permeability of STO-609 and its inhibitory effect on CaM-KK activity in intact cells as shown in Fig. 4, we assayed endogenous CaM-KK activity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with STO-609 by using an adenovirus infection system. When Ca2+/CaM-independent CaM-KIV (305HMDT-DEDD) is overexpressed from recombinant adenoviruses in SH-SY5Y cells with a constitutively active CaM-KK-(1–434) by infection, the mobility of an immunoreactive band corresponding to CaM-KIV on the SDS-7.5% PAGE gel is decreased compared with that observed for the CaM-KIV mutant alone (Fig. 5A). The mobility shift of the CaM-KIV band is likely due to hyper-autophosphorylation subsequent to activation/phosphorylation of the Thr-196 residue by CaM-KK because the mobility shift is not detected for a corresponding CaM-KIV kinase-deficient mutant (305HMDT-DEDD, K71E) co-expressed with constitutively active CaM-KK. This is consistent with previous reports that the autophosphorylation of multiple Ser residues at the N terminus of CaM-KIV is highly induced by phosphorylation of Thr-196 by CaM-KK (10Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5617-5622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 36Chatila T. Ho K.A. Anderson N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have observed that the protein kinase activity of the Ca2+/CaM-independent CaM-KIV is 8–10-fold induced by co-infection of adenovirus bearing a constitutively active CaM-KK (data not shown) indicating that the mobility shift of the CaM-KIV band on SDS-PAGE gel reflects an activated form of CaM-KIV produced by CaM-KK phosphorylation. Therefore, we quantified the intensity of the mobility-shifted CaM-KIV band to confirm endogenous CaM-KK activity, and also we examined the effect of the inhibitor on endogenous CaM-KK activity in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 5B). Overexpression of Ca2+/CaM-independent CaM-KIV after serum withdrawal consistently results in the appearance of a small amount of the mobility-shifted band, indicating the presence of Ca2+/CaM-independent CaM-KK activity in these cells. This is consistent with previous observations demonstrating that CaM-KKβ, unlike CaM-KKα, is highly Ca2+/CaM-independent (5Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G.

Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Treatment of infected SH-SY5Y cells with 1 μm ionomycin for 10 min significantly induces the activation of CaM-KIV, which is dramatically suppressed by treatment with 1 μg/ml STO-609 (∼80% inhibition). Concentrations of ∼0.1 μg/ml STO-609 cause a 50–60% inhibition of the CaM-KIV activation. This result correlates well with the inhibitory effect of STO-609 on CaM-KK in vitro as shown in Fig. 1. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells are apparently more sensitive to STO-609 than are HeLa cells, as shown in Fig. 4 with respect to the inhibition of endogenous CaM-KK activity, suggesting that the permeability of cells to the compound is cell type-dependent. It is noteworthy that concentrations of STO-609 up to 10 μg/ml do not affect the viability of treated cells including transfected HeLa cells and SH-SY5Y cells. In summary, we have recently developed a potent and relatively selective inhibitor of CaM-KK, STO-609, which can permeate cells and which is a competitive inhibitor of ATP. Recent studies demonstrate that CaM-KK is a regulatory protein kinase for CaM-KI and CaM-KIVin vitro and in transfected cells; however, this property has not been demonstrated directly in vivo. We have shown in this report that STO-609 suppresses CaM-KK activity resulting in the inhibition of downstream CaM-KIV activity in intact cells, although it cannot inhibit downstream CaM kinase activities in vitro. Thus STO-609 could be a useful tool for evaluating the regulatory roles of CaM-KK for various physiological functions of the CaM kinase cascade such as the regulation of gene expression mediated by the CaM-KIV pathway. Furthermore, STO-609 could be used to distinguish between the functions of the two CaM-KK isoforms because the sensitivity of CaM-KKβ to the compound is ∼5-fold higher than that of the α isoform. The mechanism of differential sensitivity of CaM-KK isoforms to STO-609 is not clear, but it is not likely due to their differences in affinity for ATP because the apparent Km values of CaM-KKα and CaM-KKβ for ATP are indistinguishable (∼33 μm, Fig. 3B). Furthermore, physiological function(s) controlled by the CaM-KK/CaM-KI cascade have not been well studied, in contrast to what is known for CaM-KIV, and this question may be addressed with the use of STO-609.

https://openalex.org/W2010891163,"The CUO molecule, formed from the reaction of laser-ablated U atoms with CO in a noble gas, exhibits very different stretching frequencies in a solid argon matrix [804.3 and 852.5 wave numbers (cm −1 )] than in a solid neon matrix (872.2 and 1047.3 cm −1 ). Related experiments in a matrix consisting of 1% argon in neon suggest that the argon atoms are interacting directly with the CUO molecule. Relativistic density functional calculations predict that CUO can bind directly to one argon atom (U-Ar = 3.16 angstroms; binding energy = 3.2 kilocalories per mole), accompanied by a change in the ground state from a singlet to a triplet. Our experimental and theoretical results also suggest that multiple argon atoms can bind to a single CUO molecule."

In his Perspective, Yamanouchi reviews recent progress in this field, focusing on two intensity regimes: the Coulombic regime, which mostly deforms molecular structures and causes tunneling ionization, and the relativistic regime, where high-intensity lasers produce x-rays and high-energy particles and may cause nuclear fusion reactions. Efforts are under way to increase laser intensity further for accessing the next frontier."

We report that proteinases released from either mononucleated blood cells or polymorphonuclear neutrophils degranulated by inflammatory stimuli generate an SDF-1 fragment that is deleted from amino-terminal residues Lys1-Pro2-Val3, as characterized by mass spectrometry analysis. The proteolyzed chemokine fails to induce agonistic functions and is unable to prevent the fusogenic capacity of CXCR4-tropic human immunodeficiency viruses. Furthermore, we observed that exposure of CXCR4-expressing cells to leukocyte proteinases results in the proteolysis of the extracellular amino-terminal domain of the receptor, as assessed by flow cytometry analysis and electrophoretic separation of immunoprecipitated CXCR4. Blockade of SDF-1 and CXCR4 proteolysis by the specific leukocyte elastase inhibitor,N-methoxysuccinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-valine-chloromethyl ketone, identified elastase as the major enzyme among leukocyte-secreted proteinases that accounts for inactivation of both SDF-1 and CXCR4. Indeed, purified leukocyte elastase generated in either SDF-1 or CXCR4 a pattern of cleavage indistinguishable from that observed with leukocyte-secreted proteinases.

Chemokines regulate both basal and inflammation-induced trafficking of leukocytes. In non-immune cells such as neurons, smooth muscle, stromal, endothelial and epithelial cells, chemokines also control other aspects of tissue homeostasis (1Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3233) Google Scholar, 2Locati M. Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Most chemokines are members of one of the two subfamilies, CXC or CC, depending on whether or not the two conserved amino-terminal cysteines are spaced by an extra (X) amino acid. The biological activity of chemokines is regulated at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Thus, stimuli from injured tissues, which disturb cell homeostasis, activate expression of inducible chemokines (3Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). At a post-translational level, chemokines are in some cases regulated by selective proteolysis after secretion (4Van Damme J.

Regulation of leukocyte migration would ultimately be determined by the interplay of chemokines and proteinases (10Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Liotta L.A. Kleiner Jr., D.E.

Although natural proteolytic cleavage of chemokines occurs either at carboxyl or amino terminus, most of functionally relevant proteolysis takes place at the amino terminus, which encompasses both receptor-binding and signaling domains. Discrete amino-terminal proteolysis of chemokines changes their biological functions. In some cases limited proteolysis produces fragments with enhanced biological activity or active polypeptides from an inactive precursor (5Yoshimura T. Robinson E.A. Appella E. Matsushima K.

Given the redundancy and overlap of ligand/receptor specificities in the chemokine system, one might expect that the more striking in vivo functional consequences of selective proteolysis would occur among those chemokines that maintain non-promiscuous partnerships with their receptors.

In addition to their physiological properties, increasing evidence emphasizes the participation of SDF-1α/CXCR4 in the pathogenesis of infectious and inflammatory processes. CXCR4 plays an important role in HIV infection, because CXCR4 (along with CCR5) is one of the two major HIV coreceptors (25Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A.

Moreover, new evidence implicates the SDF-1α/CXCR4 pair in the pathogenesis of allergic airway diseases (29Gonzalo J.A. Lloyd C.M. Peled A. Delaney T. Coyle A.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. J.

Thus, although SDF-1α and CXCR4 are involved in the regulation of homeostatic processes, it becomes evident that they are also constituents of adaptive responses by inflammatory cells. Proteolytic modification of either of the partners may be a mechanism that ultimately regulates the functional activity of the SDF-1α/CXCR4 pair. Two proteolytic activities, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) (34De Meester I. Korom S. Van Damme J. Scharpe S. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and cathepsin G (CG) (35Delgado M.B. Clark-Lewis I. Loetscher P. Langen H. Thelen M. Baggiolini M. Wolf M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which are released by leukocytes, can cleave SDF-1α in vitro. However, the large diversity of soluble or cell-bound proteinases expressed by leukocytes and the possibility that a given substrate may be the target of diverse enzymes suggest that other enzymes could be involved in the regulation of SDF-1α/CXCR4 interactions. Therefore, it becomes important to define the relative contribution of putative proteolytic activities released by leukocytes that regulate SDF-1α functions. Moreover, it is important to determine whether the capacity of CXCR4 to interact with its ligand is modified by proteolysis. In this study, we report that SDF-1α and its receptor CXCR4 are modified by limited proteolysis in the presence of secreted leukocyte proteinases. We identify leukocyte elastase (LE) as the major enzyme accounting for this processing. Proteolysis occurs at the amino terminus of both molecules and results in abrogation of CXCR4/SDF-1α interaction and function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsSalt-free lyophilized human leukocyte elastase (LE) was purchased from Calbiochem and reconstituted at 35 μm in 50 mm sodium acetate, 200 mm NaCl, pH 5.5.

Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) (ATCC CCL-10) were maintained in Glasgow’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% FCS, 20 mm Hepes, and 10% tryptose phosphate.Isolation of Human PBMC or PMN and Preparation of Proteinase-enriched SupernatantsHuman peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy donors using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences AB) density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs (2 × 106cells/ml) were cultured at 37 °C in AIM V culture medium (Invitrogen) without FCS and supplemented with Glutamax and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Supernatants of PBMC cultures (PBMC-SN) were collected at various time points by centrifugation (1,500 × g for 5 min at 25 °C) and further cleared of cell debris by ultracentrifugation (18,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C) before use in SDF-1α degradation experiments. Polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes (PMN) were isolated at room temperature within 3 h of venipuncture using differential sedimentations on dextran (Sigma) and Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (42Le-Barillec K. Pidard D. Balloy V. Chignard M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 209-215PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated cells (>95% PMN) were resuspended (5 × 106 cells/ml) and equilibrated at 37 °C for 5 min in HBSS supplemented with 1.3 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2. Proteinase-enriched supernatants (PMN-SN) were obtained from activated and degranulated PMN. For this purpose, PMN were incubated with 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of 0.5 μm fMLP for 5 min with gentle agitation. Cell suspensions were rapidly cooled to 4 °C and sedimented by centrifugation (1,700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Thereafter, PMN-SN were collected and ultracentrifuged (18,000 × g, for 15 min at 4 °C) to remove cell debris and stored at −80 °C until use. Pretreatment with cytochalasin B is necessary to disrupt cytoplasmic microfilaments and to favor degranulation during PMN activation (43Wright D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 538-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cytochalasin B and/or fMLP was omitted from control samples, whereas in some experiments, fMLP was replaced with human IL-8 at 12 nm or SDF-1α over a range 0.01–1 μm. Enzymatic activities of human neutrophil LE and CG were measured in PBMC-SN or PMN-SN by hydrolysis of their specific synthetic substrates, i.e. N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide andN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, respectively, as described previously (44Renesto P. Chignard M. Blood. 1993; 82: 139-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As standards, we used serial dilutions of each purified enzyme over a wide range of concentrations.Exposure of SDF-1α to Leukocyte ProteinasesSDF-1α-bt (1 μm) or SDF-1α (1 μm) were incubated for different times at 37 °C in cell-free PBMC-SN or PMN-SN or with purified LE (diluted in AIM V medium when needed). Proteinase inhibitors were added for 25 min at 37 °C prior to incubation with the chemokine. Proteolytic reactions were carried out in a volume of 50 μl.Western Blot Analysis of SDF-1α ProteolysisDegradation of SDF-1α-bt or SDF-1α exposed to leukocyte proteinases was stopped with Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 16% acrylamide Tricine gels (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 4 h and at 25 mA per gel. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-PSQ membranes (<10-kDa cut-off, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) by semi-dry transfer for 1 h at 120 mA, and membranes were blotted with anti-SDF-1 mAb K15C (2 μg/ml) to detect the amino-terminal part of the chemokine. After stripping in 0.1m glycine, pH 2.3, and subsequent incubation in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 1 mNaCl, pH 7.4, membranes were blotted with HRP-conjugated streptavidin to identify the carboxyl terminus of the chemokine. Visualization and quantification of protein bands were performed using an electronically cooled LAS-1000 plus charge-coupled device (CCD) camera system, and Image Gauge 3.4 software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan).ESI-MS Analysis of SDF-1α ProteolysisImmediately after exposure of SDF-1α-bt or SDF-1α to leukocyte proteinases, chemokine fragments were isolated by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and samples were further analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Briefly, SDF-1α-bt degradation mixtures (150 μl) were filtered (0.45 μm) and injected on a Nucleosil 5C18 300 Å semi-preparative column (250 × 10 mm) (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). By using a 28–48% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.08% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min at a 6 ml/min flow rate, intact SDF-1α-bt or SDF-1α and their respective fragments were eluted within the 9–11-min zone. Moreover, no peaks were detected in the 9–11-min elution zone upon injection of PMN-SN, PBMC-SN, or purified LE blanks. All samples collected were lyophilized and analyzed by ESI-MS on an API 365 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Inhibition of HIV-1 Env-mediated Cell-to-Cell Fusion by SDF-1αCo-culture of HeLa cells expressing HIV-1 Env and Tat proteins (HeLa 243 cell clone) with CD4+/CXCR4+ HeLa P4.2 cells leads to HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion and Tat-dependent activation of an HIV LTR-driven β-galactosidase reporter gene. The enzymatic activity of β-galactosidase reflects the magnitude of the HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion. To assess the capacity of proteolyzed SDF-1α to prevent HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-to-cell fusion (45Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Palanche T. Amara A. Magerus A. Altmeyer R. Delaunay T. Virelizier J.L.

Cells were then incubated for 3 min at room temperature in an acidic buffer (50 mm glycine, pH 2.3) that stops receptor endocytosis and removes CXCR4-bound SDF-1α molecules that would mask CXCR4 recognition by the mAb 12G5. Jurkat cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, 0.1% BSA, before incubation with PE-conjugated mAb 12G5 (1:100) for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). Basal cell fluorescence intensity was determined using cells stained with a PE-conjugated IgG2a isotype control alone.Chemotaxis AssayMigration of CEMx174 cells, a human lymphoblastoid CXCR4+/CD4+ T cell line, was as"

Although the role of PTEN has been studied extensively, the relative contributions of its numerous potential downstream effectors to deregulated growth and tumorigenesis remain uncertain. We provide genetic evidence in Drosophila melanogaster for the paramount importance of the protein kinase Akt [also called protein kinase B (PKB)] in mediating the effects of increased phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) concentrations that are caused by the loss of PTEN function. A mutation in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt that reduces its affinity for PIP3 sufficed to rescue the lethality of flies devoid of PTEN activity. Thus, Akt appears to be the only critical target activated by increased PIP3 concentrations in Drosophila ."
https://openalex.org/W1559437335,"The evolutionary history of the dodo is very poorly understood. Like many avian island endemics, a high degree of morphological change associated with flightlessness and gigantism has obscured phylogenetic relationships, and historically the dodo has been linked with avian groups ranging from the ratites to the raptors ([1][1]). Since the mid-1800s, morphological studies have linked the dodo (initially Didus ineptus , now Raphus cucullatus ) and its presumed close relative the solitaire ( Pezophaps solitaria ) with the Columbiformes (pigeons and doves), but their exact position is unresolved and they have been placed in many positions within the cosmopolitan Columbidae or in their own family, Raphidae, outside the Columbidae but within Columbiformes ([1][1], [2][2]). To answer these questions, we extracted DNA and amplified 1.4 kb of mitochondrial sequence [360–base pair (bp) 12 S rRNA and 1050-bp cytochrome b ] from 37 species of pigeons and doves, including the dodo, the solitaire, and multiple members of each of the five extant subfamilies ([3][3]). Short overlapping fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with museum specimens limited to 120 to 180 bp. Strict ancient DNA procedures were used to minimize contamination and detect nuclear mitochondrial copies ([4][4]), PCR products were cloned, and the solitaire sequences were independently replicated at the Natural History Museum, London.

The maximum likelihood (ML) tree for the combined data set ([Fig. 1][5]) reveals that the dodo and the solitaire are sister taxa. Despite the substantial morphological differences between the dodo, the solitaire, and other pigeons, the ML analysis shows them to be nested within the family Columbidae. The closest living relative is the monotypic Nicobar pigeon ( Caloenas nicobarica ) from the Nicobar Islands and nearby Southeast Asia, and the sister taxa to this clade are the crowned pigeons ( Goura ), from New Guinea. The unusual Samoan tooth-billed pigeon Didunculus strigirostris (originally named for its dodolike beak) is the basal member of this strongly supported clade of large, generally ground-dwelling, island endemics. Furthermore, the phylogeographic distribution of this morphologically diverse clade suggests that the dodo and the solitaire dispersed from Southeast Asia to the Mascarenes at some point in the past. [Figure 1][5] indicates that a similar route was used by the Madagascan endemic Alectroenas madagascariensis , which is closely related to another Indo-Australian radiation.

Figure 1 
ML tree depicting the phylogenetic relationships of 37 species of pigeons and doves. Geographic distributions of the pigeons are as follows: Australian (red), African/Madagascan (green), Asian/Southeast Asian (purple), Mascarene Island (blue), and New World (yellow) taxa. The concentration of New World taxa at the base of the tree suggests that the initial radiation occurred in the New World. ML bootstrap consensus values for relationships with ≥70% support (italicized) and Bayesian posterior support values (bold) are given. Detailed phylogenetic analyses of potential outgroups identified Laridae, and consequently two species (Great Skua, Catharacta skua , and Parasitic Jaeger, Stercorarius parasiticus ) were used ([3][3]).



Two external fossil calibrations were used in separate ML molecular clock calculations after tests found no violation of clocklike behavior ([3][3]). The analyses indicate that the dodo/solitaire and Caloenas diverged in the mid/late Eocene, around 42.6 million years ago (Ma) (95% confidence interval = 31.9 to 56.1 Ma), whereas the dodo and the solitaire separated in the late Oligocene, about 25.6 Ma (17.6 to 35.9 Ma). The latter date is biogeographically interesting as it is considerably older than the islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues. Geological evidence suggests that Mauritius emerged in a series of volcanic events, the earliest of which occurred around 6.8 to 7.8 Ma, whereas Rodrigues did not emerge until 1.5 Ma ([5][7]). Therefore, it seems highly unlikely that the large genetic distance between the dodo and the solitaire resulted from isolation on the two islands. Drilling projects have established that ridges surrounding the Mascarene Plateau were above sea level in the late Oligocene and have subsided slowly thereafter ([5][7]). The similarity between the timing of the dodo/solitaire divergence and the first geological evidence of land in the Mascarene island chain is striking and suggests that island stepping-stones may have been used before the two species eventually found their way to Mauritius and Rodrigues. Whether such dispersal was flighted or not cannot currently be determined, although the relatively isolated position and young age of Rodrigues would suggest that the solitaire, at least, may have retained a capacity for flight up until at least 1.5 Ma.

https://openalex.org/W2139829222,"The recognition of invading microbes followed by the induction of effective innate immune response is crucial for host survival. Human surface epithelial cells are situated at host-environment boundaries and thus act as the first line of host defense against invading microbes. They recognize the microbial ligands via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed on the surface of epithelial cells. TLR2 has gained importance as a major receptor for a variety of microbial ligands. In contrast to its high expression in lymphoid tissues, TLR2 is expressed at low level in epithelial cells. Thus, it remains unclear whether the low amount of TLR2 expressed in epithelial cells is sufficient for mediating bacteria-induced host defense and immune response and whether TLR2 expression can be up-regulated by bacteria during infection. Here, we show that TLR2, although expressed at very low level in unstimulated human epithelial cells, is greatly up-regulated by nontypeableHemophilus influenzae (NTHi), an important human bacterial pathogen causing otitis media and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Activation of an IKKβ-IκBα-dependent NF-κB pathway is required for TLR2 induction, whereas inhibition of the MKK3/6-p38α/β pathway leads to enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation. Surprisingly, glucocorticoids, well known potent anti-inflammatory agents, synergistically enhance NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation likely via a negative cross-talk with the p38 MAP kinase pathway. These studies may bring new insights into the role of bacteria and glucocorticoids in regulating host defense and immune response and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for modulating innate immune and inflammatory responses for otitis media and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.

These studies may bring new insights into the role of bacteria and glucocorticoids in regulating host defense and immune response and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for modulating innate immune and inflammatory responses for otitis media and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Effective host defense against invading microorganisms requires the detection of foreign pathogens and the rapid deployment of an antimicrobial effector response (1.Krutzik S.R. Sieling P.A. Modlin R.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the host innate immune system, the surface epithelial cells are situated at host-environment boundaries and thus act as the first line of host defense against pathogenic bacteria (2.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). They recognize the invading bacteria by directly interacting with pathogen-associated molecular patterns on a variety of bacteria via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TLRToll-like receptorCAPEcaffeic acid phenethyl esterCOPDchronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseDEXdexamethasoneGRglucocorticoid receptorIKKIκB kinaseNTHinontypeable H. influenzaeMAP kinasemitogen-activated protein kinaseMKKMAP kinase kinaseNHBEnormal human bronchial epithelial cellsRTreverse transcriptase expressed on the host (3.Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2632) Google Scholar). Activation of TLRs, in turn, leads to induction of direct antimicrobial activity that can result in elimination of the invading pathogen before a full adaptive immune response takes effect (4.Thoma-Uszynski S. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1544-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of TLRs is also a prerequisite for the triggering of acquired immunity (5.Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar). TLRs are type I transmembrane receptors with leucine-rich repeats in the extracellular domains and cytoplasmic domains that resemble the mammalian IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) (6.O'Neil L.A. Dinarello C.A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 206-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 7.Means T.K. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. Life Sci. 2000; 68: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To date, 10 members of the human TLR family have been cloned. Of these, TLR2 and TLR4 have been well studied. While TLR4 seems to be mainly involved in Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling, TLR2 can respond to a variety of Gram-positive products, including peptidoglycan, lipoprotein, lipoteichoic acid, and lipoarabinomannan. The importance of TLR2 in host defense was further supported by the studies from knock-out mice showing decreased survival of TLR2-deficient mice after infection with Gram-positiveStaphylococcus aureus (8.Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Moreover, our recent study demonstrated that TLR2 also plays an important role in activation of NF-κB by lipoprotein from the Gram-negative bacterium nontypeableHemophilus influenzae (NTHi), a major cause of otitis media and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (9.Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that TLR2 plays a crucial role in host defense against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. In contrast to its relatively higher expression in lymphoid tissues, TLR2 is expressed at a low level in epithelial cells. Given the low expression of TLR2 in unstimulated human epithelial cells, it remains unclear whether the low amount of TLR2 expressed in epithelial cells is sufficient for mediating NTHi-induced inflammatory response and whether TLR2 expression can be up-regulated by bacteria in human epithelial cells during bacterial infections. Here, we explore the possibility that NTHi up-regulates TLR2 in human epithelial cells via activation of specific signaling pathways. Our studies reveal that TLR2, although expressed at very low level in unstimulated human epithelial cells, is greatly up-regulated by NTHi. Activation of IKKβ-IκBα-dependent NF-κB pathway is required for TLR2 induction, whereas inhibition of the MKK3/6-p38α/β pathway leads to enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation. Moreover, glucocorticoids, well known potent anti-inflammatory agents, synergistically enhance NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation likely via a negative cross-talk with the inhibitory p38 MAP kinase pathway. These studies, although rather unexpected, may provide novel insights into the role of bacteria and glucocorticoids in regulating host defense and innate immune responses and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for modulating innate immune and inflammatory responses for otitis media and COPD.

For making NTHi crude extract, NTHi were harvested from a plate of chocolate agar after overnight incubation and incubated in 30 ml of brain heart infusion broth supplemented with NAD (3.5 μg/ml). After overnight incubation, NTHi were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The resulting pellet of NTHi was suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated. Subsequently, the lysate was collected and stored at −70 °C. NTHi whole cell lysate was used in all the experiments, unless otherwise indicated. Human cervix epithelial cell line HeLa was maintained as described previously (9.Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J.

Human middle ear epithelial cell line HMEEC-1 derived by human papillomavirus immortalization of primary human middle ear epithelial cells and primary human airway epithelial cells (NHBE) (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) were maintained in bronchial epithelial basal medium (Clonetics) following manufacturer's instruction. Total RNA was isolated from human epithelial cells using a Qiagen kit (Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction. For the RT reaction, the Moloney murine leukemia virus preamplification system (Invitrogen) was used. PCR amplification was performed with Taq gold polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 32 cycles at 95 °C for 60 s, 63 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s (for TLR2) and 32 cycles at 95 °C for 60 s, 50 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s (for cyclophilin). The oligonucleotide primers were: TLR2, 5′-GCCAAAGTCTTGATTGATTGG-3′ and 5′-TTGAAGTTCTCCAGCTCCTG-3′; cyclophilin, 5′-CCGTGTTCTTCGACATTGCC-3′ and 5′-ACACCACATGCTTGCCATCC-3′. Total RNA was isolated from human epithelial cells as described above. For the RT reaction, TaqMan reverse transcription regents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used. Briefly, the RT reaction (final volume of total 50 μl) was conducted for 60 min at 37 °C followed by 60 min at 42 °C using oligo(dT) and random hexamers. PCR amplification was performed with TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). In brief, reactions were performed in duplicate containing 2× Universal PCR master mix, 2 μl of template cDNA, 200 nm of TLR2 primers (5′-GGCCAGCAAATTACCTGTGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGCGGACATCCTGAACCT-3′) and 100 nm of TLR2 probe (5′-TCCATCCCATGTGCGTGGCC-3′) in a final volume of 25 μl and were analyzed in a 96-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). TLR2 primers and probes were synthesized by Applied Biosystems custom oligo synthesis service. Probes include a fluorescent reporter dye, FAM, on the 5′ end and labeled with a fluorescent quencher dye, TAMRA, on the 3′ end to allow direct detection of the PCR product. Reactions were amplified and quantified using an ABI 7700 sequence detector and manufacturer's software (Applied Biosystems). The relative quantity of TLR2 mRNA was obtained using the comparative CT method and was normalized using pre-developed TaqMan assay reagent human cyclophilin as an endogenous control (Applied Biosystems) (for details, see user Bulletin 2 for the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System under www.appliedbiosystems.com/support/tutorials). Briefly, the TaqMan software (Applied Biosystem) was used to calculate a Ct value for each reaction, where the Ct value is the point in the extension phase of the PCR reaction that the product is distinguishable from the background. The Ct values were then normalized for TLR2 amplification by subtracting the Ct value calculated for cyclophilin, an endogenous control for the amount of mRNA from the same sample, to obtain a Ct using the following equation: Ct TLR2 − Ct cyclophilin = Ct. The NTHi-dependent or other inducer-dependent fold induction of TLR2 was calculated relative to the Ct value obtained in the unstimulated cells. The normalized TLR2 expression was thus expressed as relative quantity of TLR2 mRNA (fold induction). TLR4 mRNA was measured using TLR4 primers (5′-CCAGTGAGGATGATGCCAGGAT-3′ and 5′-GCCATGGCTGGGATCAGAGT-3′) and a TLR4 probe (5′-TGTCTGCCTCGCGCCTGGC-3′) and was then normalized similarly to TLR2.

The reporter construct was sequenced to verify number and orientation of inserted oligonucleotides. All transient transfections were carried out in duplicate for RT-PCR analysis and in triplicate for luciferase assays using TransIT-LT1 reagent (Panvera, Medison, WI) following the manufacturer's instruction, unless otherwise indicated. In all co-transfections with expression plasmids of signaling molecules, an empty vector was used as a control. Cells were cultured on four-chamber microscope slides. After NTHi treatment, the cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde solution (4%) and incubated with mouse anti-p65 NF-κB monoclonal antibody for 1 h (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Primary antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Samples were viewed and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. To detect TLR2 up-regulation at protein level, Western blot analysis was carried out using antibodies against human TLR2. To ensure the specificity, two antibodies against human TLR2 from different sources were used, including a polyclonal antibody to TLR2 (H-175) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a monoclonal antibody to TLR2 (IMG-319) (IMGENEX, San Diego, CA). HeLa cells transfected with human wild-type TLR2 expression plasmid served as a positive control for TLR2 expression. To assess phosphorylation of p38, Western blot analysis was carried out using antibodies against phospho-p38(Thr180/182) and p38 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Phosphorylation of p38 was detected as described previously (9.Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 14.Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Celloidin-embedded sections of normal and diseased mucosa from archival temporal bone specimens were obtained from the House Ear Institute's Temporal Bone Collection. Following de-celloidination with ether and absolute ethanol, nonspecific binding sites on the slides were blocked using normal goat serum. The sections were then subjected to antigen retrieval (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and incubated with polyclonal antibody against human TLR2 (H-175) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Signals were detected by the avidin/biotin complex method (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). We first examined whether NTHi up-regulates TLR2 in human epithelial cells. We previously showed that TLR2 was expressed at a low level in a variety of human epithelial cells by RT-PCR analysis (9.Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the expression of TLR2 was very low in HeLa (human cervix epithelial) cells, but was up-regulated by NTHi. Similar results were also observed in HMEEC-1 (human middle ear epithelial) and primary human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells (data not shown). We next sought to confirm whether NTHi up-regulates TLR2 by performing real-time quantitative PCR analysis. NTHi indeed strongly up-regulates TLR2 mRNA in HeLa, HMEEC-1, and NHBE cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1,B and C). Because TLR4 represents another important member of TLR family, we also evaluated the effect of NTHi on TLR4 expression in human epithelial cells. Interestingly, TLR4 did not appear to be strongly up-regulated (Fig. 1 D). To determine whether up-regulation of TLR2 mRNA is accompanied by elevated TLR2 protein, Western blot analysis was carried out using antibodies against human TLR2. As shown in Fig. 1 E, up-regulation of TLR2 was also observed at protein level. To further confirm whether TLR2 protein is elevated in diseased tissue in vivo, immunohistochemical analysis of TLR2 protein was performed in human middle ear tissues obtained from patients with chronic otitis media and normal individuals, respectively. In comparison with that from normal individuals, the expression of TLR2 protein is indeed higher in epithelial cells of middle ear tissue from patients with chronic otitis media (Fig. 1 F). Taken together, these data demonstrate that TLR2, but not TLR4, is up-regulated in human epithelial cells by NTHi. Having demonstrated that TLR2 is up-regulated in human epithelial cells by NTHi, still unknown is which intracellular signaling pathways are involved. Based on the essential involvement of NF-κB in regulating the expression of large numbers of genes involved in immunity and inflammation and our recent study showing the activation of NF-κB by NTHi (9.Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10.Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), we determined the role of NF-κB in NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation by using CAPE, a chemical inhibitor that is known to specifically block the translocation of p65 without affecting IκBα degradation (11.Natarajan K. Singh S. Burke T.R. Grunberger D. Aggarwal B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9090-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, CAPE greatly reduced NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation, suggesting that activation of NF-κB is involved in NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation. Because disruption of the NF-κB·IκBα complex is required for NF-κB nuclear translocation and activation, we next determined the requirement of IκBα degradation by assessing the effect of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and overexpression of a transdominant mutant of IκBα on NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation (12.Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T. Zeng H. Young A.N. Hobert M.E. Karmali V. Rao A.S. Madara J.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 13.Beauparlant P. Kwon H. Clarke M. Lin R. Sonenberg N. Wainberg M. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5777-5785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, MG-132 and overexpression of a transdominant mutant IκBα markedly inhibited TLR2 up-regulation (Fig. 2 A). Concomitantly, NTHi-induced NF-κB activation and translocation was also blocked by MG-132 in the same epithelial HeLa cells (Fig. 2, B and C). On the basis of a recent report that IκB kinase β (IKKβ) acts as an immediate upstream kinase of IκBα, we investigated the role of IKKβ in NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation (10.Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Cotransfection with a dominant-negative mutant form of IKKβ (IKKβ(K44A)) abrogated NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation (Fig. 2 D). We further confirmed the involvement of NF-κB by transfecting the epithelial cells with an expression plasmid of wild-type p65, the major subunit of NF-κB. Interestingly, expression of wild-type p65 induced TLR2 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 E). As expected, expression of p65 also induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2 F). Collectively, these findings clearly demonstrated that the IKKβ-IκBα-dependent translocation and activation of NF-κB are required for NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation in human epithelial cells. Many cellular stress stimuli can activate both NF-κB and p38 MAP kinase modules. Because of this overlap as well as our recent report that NTHi strongly activates p38 MAP kinase (9.Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 14.Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S.

Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), we investigated whether p38 MAP kinase is also involved in NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation. Surprisingly, the pyridinyl imidazole SB203580, a highly specific inhibitor for p38 MAP kinase greatly enhanced NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation in a dose-dependent manner (16.Adams J.L. Lee D. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 1999; 2: 96-109PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of p38 MAP kinase may be negatively involved in NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant form of either p38α (fp38α(AF)) or p38β (fp38β(AF)) also enhanced the NTHi-induced TLR2 expression, whereas overexpression of a wild-type p38α or p38β reduced it, thereby further supporting the negative involvement of p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 3 B). As immediate upstream kinases of p38 α and β, two MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK6) have been identified (15.Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether activation of MKK3/6 is also negatively involved in NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation, a dominant-negative mutant form of either MKK3 (MKK3b(A)) or MKK6 (MKK6b(A)) was transfected into HeLa cells. The NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation was enhanced (Fig. 3 C). Thus, we concluded from this data that activation of MKK3/6-p38 α/β MAP kinase pathway may be negatively involved in NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation. Glucocorticoids have been used widely as anti-inflammatory agents. They exert their anti-inflammatory effects by down-regulating NF-κB-dependent transcription of a variety of genes involved in the inflammatory response (17.Karin M. Cell. 1998; 93: 487-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Since we have shown that activation of NF-κB is required for NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation, it is therefore logical that glucocorticoids may attenuate NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation. To test this, we first evaluated the effect of dexamethasone (DEX), a glucocorticoid analog in human epithelial cells, on NTHi-induced up-regulation of TLR2 mRNA. Surprisingly, DEX synergistically enhanced NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation at mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). Concomitantly, Western blot analysis showed that DEX also synergistically enhanced NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation at protein level (Fig. 4 B). These results are rather unexpected, because they were in sharp contrast to the inhibitory effect of DEX on cytokine production (18.Webster J.C. Cidlowski J.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 396-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Additionally, RU486, a synthetic antiglucocorticoid that acts as a competitor against binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), counteracted the enhancing effect of DEX on NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation, suggesting the involvement of GR (Fig. 4 C) (19.Subramaniam N. Treuter E. Okret S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18121-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of wild-type GR in HeLa cells greatly enhanced the synergistic effect of DEX on NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation, confirming the involvement of GR (Fig. 4 D) (20.Kassel O. Sancono A. Kratzschmar J. Kreft B. Stassen M. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7108-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Note that a maximal response was observed with 1 μmDEX. Together, these results indicate that DEX synergistically enhanced NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation at both mRNA and protein levels via a GR-dependent mechanism. One key issue that has yet to be addressed is how DEX synergistically enhances NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation. Because our results in Fig. 3, A and B, indicated that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase also synergistically enhanced NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation and glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit p38 MAP kinase activity (21.Lasa M. Brook M. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we therefore postulated that glucocorticoids may enhance NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation via a negative cross-talk with p38 MAP kinase pathway. Our hypothesis was first supported by the result shown in Fig. 4 E (upper panel) that DEX no longer enhanced NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation if the cells were already pretreated with SB203580, suggesting that DEX and SB203580 may target the same p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway. However, considering that the result was observed with 5 μm SB203580 and 1 μm DEX, a dose shown to elicit a maximal response when used alone, we cannot rule out the possibility that the system was already working at its maximal level. We therefore studied the effect of low doses of both SB203580 and DEX on NTHi-induced TLR2 expression. Interestingly, when 0.1 μm DEX was added to the cells that were already pretreated with 0.1 μm SB203580, NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation was further enhanced (Fig. 4E,lower panel), thereby suggesting that their ability to enhance TLR2 up-regulation is likely additive to each other. However, it is still unclear whether or not DEX indeed additively enhances TLR2 up-regulation via inhibition of p38 MAP kinase. We therefore investigated the direct effect of DEX on NTHi-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. As shown in Fig. 4 F, NTHi-induced phosphorylation of p38 was attenuated by DEX pretreatment. Thus, our data demonstrated that glucocorticoids synergistically enhance NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation likely via a negative cross-talk with p38 MAP kinase pathway, although our data do not preclude the possibility that a direct protein-DNA interaction between GR and glucocorticoid response element in the regulatory region of the TLR2 gene may also contribute to this synergistic regulation. From what we have shown above, it is evident that TLR2, although expressed at very low level in unstimulated human epithelial cells, is greatly up-regulated by NTHi via a positive IKKβ-IκBα-dependent NF-κB pathway and a likely negative MKK3/6-p38 α/β pathway. The up-regulation of TLR2 by NTHi appears to be consistent with the function of a DrosophilaToll protein whose expression is also up-regulated by a pathogen challenge (22.Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar). Our finding may have several important implications in host defense and immune response against bacteria. First, the very low expression of TLR2 we observed in unstimulated epithelial cells is likely to be an important aspect of TLR2 function, because under limiting conditions, cellular responses to pathogen-associated molecular patterns could be more stringently regulated by controlling the amounts of TLR protein produced (23.Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.H. Wyllie D.H. Dower S.K. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Second, the increased TLR2 expression will probably contribute to the accelerated immune response by epithelial cells as well as resensitization of epithelial cells to invading pathogens. If so, regulation of TLR2 expression may be one of the immune regulatory mechanisms commonly involved in host defense against many bacterial strains. Finally, the observation that TLR2 expression is up-regulated by NTHi suggests that invading bacteria cannot only initiate the host immune response, but can also modulate the eventual responsiveness of epithelial cells to the invading bacteria by regulating the TLR2 expression level (24.Faure E. Thomas L. Xu H. Medvedev A. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2018-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, these observations offer a new insight for fully understanding the important role of TLR2 in epithelial cell defense and immune response against invading bacteria. Another major interesting finding in this study is the synergistic enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation by glucocorticoids via a negative cross-talk with the inhibitory p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway. This result, although rather unexpected, may provide a novel insight into the role of glucocorticoids in host defense and inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Recently, it has been shown that TLR2-deficient mice are highly susceptible to bacterial infection, demonstrating a critical role of TLR2 in host defense against invading bacteria (8.Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Therefore, the synergistic enhancement of NTHi-induced TLR2 expression by glucocorticoids would undoubtedly contribute to the host defense against bacteria. Since we also provided direct evidence that activation of NF-κB is involved in NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation and glucocorticoids are widely known to inhibit NF-κB activity (17.Karin M. Cell. 1998; 93: 487-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar,18.Webster J.C. Cidlowski J.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 396-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), a critical question that has yet to be answered is whether glucocorticoids also inhibit NTHi-induced NF-κB activation, and if so, what mechanisms account for this synergistic enhancement of TLR2 expression. To determine whether glucocorticoids inhibit NF-κB activity, we directly evaluated the effect of glucocorticoids on NTHi-induced NF-κB-dependent promoter activity by using luciferase reporter plasmid in HeLa cells. As expected, glucocorticoids reduced NTHi-induced NF-κB activation by ≈70–80% (Fig. 5). Therefore, it may well be that additional positive signaling pathways that cannot be inhibited by DEX, together with the direct induction of TLR2 by DEX as well as the inhibition of the negative p38 MAP kinase pathway by DEX, are responsible for the synergistic up-regulation of TLR2 by NTHi and DEX. Thus, the model of the synergistic up-regulation of TLR2 by NTHi and glucocorticoids has become more complex (Fig. 6). Future studies will focus on identifying other positive signaling pathways involved in TLR2 induction. Cloning of the regulatory region of human TLR2 will help to elucidate the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved in TLR2 up-regulation. These studies may lead to novel therapeutic intervention for modulating host defense and innate immune and inflammatory responses for otitis media and COPD.Figure 6Schematic representation of the signaling pathways involved in TLR2 up-regulation by NTHi and glucocorticoids in human epithelial cells. As indicated, NTHi up-regulates TLR2 expression via a positive IKKβ-IκBα-dependent NF-κB pathway and a likely negative MKK3/6-p38 α/β pathway. Glucocorticoids, well known potent anti-inflammatory agents, synergistically enhance NTHi-induced TLR2 up-regulation likely via a negative cross-talk with the inhibitory p38 MAP kinase pathway. The up-regulated TLR2 leads to enhanced immune and inflammatory responses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We thank A. S. Baldwin for p65 expression plasmid."

An increase in the intracellular concentration of ADP following glucose starvation stimulates KATP channel activity by slowing the rate of ATP hydrolysis at NBF2, locking NBF2 in a post-hydrolytic state (18.Zingman L.V.

Normal expression of functional KATP channels on the cell surface requires co-assembly of SUR1 and Kir6.2 into an octameric complex. This co-assembly is thought to cause shielding of a -RKR- tripeptide ER retention/retrieval signal in each of the SUR1 and Kir6.2 channel subunit (24.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Without proper shielding of the RKR signal, individual subunits and partial channel complexes are retained in the ER (24.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Therefore, they (21.Sharma N. Crane A. Clement IV, J.P. Gonzalez G. Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol.

We recently demonstrated that a PHHI-associated single amino acid deletion mutation in SUR1 (ΔF1388) results in defective trafficking and a loss of cell surface expression of KATP channels (22.Cartier E.A.

Here, we report functional and cell biological analyses of a SUR1 mutation, L1544P, that we identified in a patient with PHHI. This mutation reduces surface expression of KATP channels; it also reduces response of the channel to MgADP and diazoxide. We show that simultaneous removal of the -RKR- ER retention/retrieval signal in both SUR1 and Kir6.2 nearly completely reversed the trafficking defect caused by the L1544P SUR1 mutation.DISCUSSIONKATP channels regulate the resting membrane potential of pancreatic β-cells, the failure of KATP channels to open in response to glucose deprivation results in constant membrane depolarization and persistent insulin secretion (1.Ashcroft F.M.

The dysfunction of KATP channels attributed to genetic mutations is now recognized as the major cause of the insulin secretion disease PHHI (6.Permutt M.A. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B.

Identification and functional studies of PHHI-causing KATP channel mutations have continued to provide insight into the physiological and pharmacological regulation of these channels. Of the mutations reported to date, some cause severe truncation of the SUR1 or Kir6.2 protein (32.Dunne M.J. Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Sanchez J.A. James R.F.L. Johnson P.R.V. Aynsley-Green A. Lu S.

Some SUR1 mutations specifically reduce or abolish the ability of channels to be stimulated by the physiological regulator ADP, rendering the mutant channels unable to open during glucose starvation (19.Nichols C.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35947-35952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) showed that lack of proper surface expression of functional KATP channels attributed to defective channel trafficking is the consequence of some PHHI-associated SUR1 mutations. In this study, we report that a SUR1 point mutation, L1544P, identified in a PHHI patient not only causes defects in channel function but also causes defects in channel trafficking. We provide evidence that the trafficking defect is likely to stem from improper shielding of the ER retention/retrieval signal in the two channel subunits.The L1544P Mutant Channel Phenotype Is Consistent with Clinical Observations of the PatientReconstitution of L1544P-SUR1 mutant KATP channels in COS cells shows that the mutant channel is expressed at only ∼20% level of the wild-type channel. Moreover, the response of the mutant channel to stimulation by MgADP or diazoxide is greatly reduced. As a result, channel activity in intact cells under metabolic inhibition is markedly compromised. The functional phenotype of the L1544P-SUR1 mutant channels that we observed from these in vitro studies is consistent with the clinical phenotype. The patient did not respond well to diazoxide treatment and therefore underwent subtotal pancreatectomy at 8 weeks of age. Although the L1544P mutant channels have some residual response to diazoxide (Fig. 2 B) and might be expected to respond to high dosage of diazoxide treatment, the reduced cell surface expression of the channel is likely to exacerbate the problem and render any diazoxide effect negligible. Our findings underscore the importance of normal KATP channel expression and channel response to MgADP in proper function of pancreatic β-cells.Functional Defect Caused by the L1544P-SUR1 MutationThe L1544P mutation greatly reduces the response of the resulting channel to stimulation by MgADP, a functional defect shared by a number of other PHHI-SUR1 mutations (19.Nichols C.G.

Most of these other mutations are located within the NBF2, which binds and hydrolyzes nucleotides to promote KATP channel activity (16.Ueda K. Komine J. Matsuo M. Seino S. Amachi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18.Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Bienengraeber M. Hodgson D. Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A.

Therefore, a loss of channel response to MgADP may result from the effects of the mutations on nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis (16.Ueda K. Komine J. Matsuo M. Seino S. Amachi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17.Bienengraeber M. Alekseev A.E. Abraham M.R. Carrasco A.J. Moreau C. Vivaudou M. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A.

Leucine 1544 is located near the C terminus of SUR1 just downstream of the predicted NBF2; it is not expected to participate directly in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Another mutation, F591L, which is also outside of the two NBFs, has similar detrimental effects on channel response to MgADP and diazoxide (20.Shyng S.-L. Ferrigni T. Shepard J. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Permutt M.A. Nichols C.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We speculate that these two mutations may reside in regions involved in the functional coupling between SUR1 and Kir6.2 following nucleotide binding and hydrolysis at the NBFs.Cell Biological Defects Caused by the L1544P MutationThe L1544P-SUR1 mutant channels exhibit reduced surface expression compared with wild-type channels. Our results suggest that increased degradation of the mutant channel on the cell surface is unlikely to be a major cause of reduced surface expression. First, the steady-state level of total cellular L1544P-SUR1 was not significantly different from that of wild-type SUR1. Second, the inhibition of the lysosomal or the proteasomal degradation pathway did not improve surface expression of the L1544P-SUR1 mutant channels. Rather, the reduced surface expression is primarily because of improper shielding of the tripeptide -RKR- ER retention/retrieval signal in the channel subunits. The inactivation or removal of the signal in either SUR1 or Kir6.2 partially corrected the trafficking defect of the mutant channels, and simultaneous inactivation of the signal in both channel subunits completely reversed the trafficking defect. The observation that in the absence of Kir6.2 the surface expression of L1544PAAA-fSUR1 is as efficient as WTAAA-fSUR1 (Fig. 5 A) indicates that the L1544P mutation itself does not impair the ability of the protein to traffic to the cell surface. Thus, the trafficking defect caused by the L1544P-SUR1 mutation is Kir6.2-dependent, consistent with the idea that the mutation prevents normal interaction between the SUR1 and Kir6.2 subunits such that the ER retention signals are not effectively shielded. Because L1544PAAA-fSUR1 is capable of trafficking to the cell surface in the absence of Kir6.2, one might argue that the L1544PAAA-fSUR1 detected on the surface of cells co-transfected with ΔC25Kir6.2 is not incorporated into the channel complex. However, this argument is counteracted by the observation that surface expression of L1544PAAA-fSUR1 in cells co-transfected with wild-type Kir6.2 is much lower than in cells co-transfected with ΔC25Kir6.2 (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, the increased surface expression of L1544PAAA-fSUR1 in cells co-transfected with ΔC25Kir6.2 is accompanied by a concomitant increase in KATP currents that cannot be accounted for by the expression of ΔC25Kir6.2 homomeric channels alone.An anterograde channel trafficking signal at the C terminus of SUR1 has been shown as necessary for efficient surface expression of KATP channels (21.Sharma N. Crane A. Clement IV, J.P. Gonzalez G. Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20628-20632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Leucine 1544 is located near the C terminus of SUR1 (human SUR1 has 1582 amino acids). We cannot rule out the possibility that L1544 is part of an anterograde trafficking signal. However, whatever negative effect the L1544P mutation has on the anterograde trafficking signal, it is overcome by eliminating the ER retention signal.The fact that ∼20% L1544P-SUR1 mutant channels do reach the cell surface indicates that the mutant SUR1 is able to assemble with Kir6.2 to form functional channels. Nevertheless, it is possible that the L1544P mutation could interfere with the ability of SUR1 to physically associate with Kir6.2, thereby reducing the number of properly assembled channel complexes. To address this issue, we examined surface expression of a fSUR1-Kir6.2 dimer containing the L1544P mutation. This dimer construct links the C terminus of SUR1 to the N terminus of Kir6.2 and forces physical association between the two subunits. The wild-type dimer construct has been previously shown to form functional channels with proper surface expression (12.Clement IV, J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 14.Shyng S.-L. Nichols C.G. J. Gen.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). We found that the L1544P-fSUR1-Kir6.2 dimer did not correct the trafficking defect caused by the mutation (data not shown), arguing that the mutation is unlikely to reduce channel expression simply by preventing SUR1 from associating with Kir6.2.Comparison between the L1544P-SUR1 Mutation and Other SUR1 Mutations That Cause Defective KATP Channel TraffickingIn addition to L1544P, two other PHHI-SUR1 mutations, ΔF1388 and R1394H, have been reported to cause defective KATP channel trafficking (22.Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23.Partridge C.J. Beech D.J. Sivaprasadarao A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35947-35952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ΔF1388 mutation differs from the L1544P mutation in several respects. First, the ΔF1388 mutation completely abolished surface expression of KATP channels. Second, the inactivation of the RKR ER retention signal in ΔF1388-SUR1 only led to minimal surface expression of the protein both in the presence and absence of Kir6.2 (22.Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). Third, the co-expression with Kir6.2ΔC25 did not increase surface expression of ΔF1388-fSUR1. 2G. Taschenberger and S.-L. Shyng, unpublished data. These results show that the ΔF1388 mutation causes retention of SUR1 even after the removal of the RKR signal possibly by causing protein misfolding. In contrast, L1544P does not hinder the trafficking of SUR1 as long as the retention signal in SUR1 is inactivated, suggesting that the mutation is unlikely to cause major misfolding of the protein.The R1394H mutation has recently been reported to cause channel retention in the Golgi compartment when expressed in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the trafficking defect of R1394H-SUR1 could be corrected by diazoxide treatment, which was blocked by glibenclamide (23.Partridge C.J. Beech D.J. Sivaprasadarao A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35947-35952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We did not observe significant effects of either diazoxide or glibenclamide on surface expression of the L1544P-SUR1 mutant channels. Therefore, the potential therapeutic value of KATP channel drugs in correcting trafficking defects is limited to specific mutations.In summary, we have identified a novel SUR1 mutation, L1544P, in a patient with the severe form of PHHI. The resulting mutant KATP channel is defective in its ability to respond to MgADP stimulation as well as its ability to traffic to the cell surface. Our study places the L1544P mutation in a growing list of PHHI-SUR1 mutations that affect channel response to MgADP and channel trafficking and further highlights the two mechanisms in the etiology of PHHI.

https://openalex.org/W1981264339,"Calbindin D(28k) is a member of the calmodulin superfamily of Ca(2+)-binding proteins and contains six EF-hands. The protein is generally believed to function as a Ca(2+) buffer, but the studies presented in this work indicate that it may also act as a Ca(2+) sensor. The results show that Mg(2+) binds to the same sites as Ca(2+) with an association constant of approximately 1.4.10(3) m(-1) in 0.15 m KCl. The four high affinity sites in calbindin D(28k) bind Ca(2+) in a non-sequential, parallel manner. In the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg(2+), the Ca(2+) affinity is reduced by a factor of 2, and the cooperativity, which otherwise is modest, increases. Based on the binding constants determined in the presence of physiological salt concentrations, we estimate that at the Ca(2+) concentration in a resting cell calbindin D(28k) is saturated to 40-75% with Mg(2+) but to less than 9% with Ca(2+). In contrast, the protein is expected to be nearly fully saturated with Ca(2+) at the Ca(2+) level of an activated cell. A substantial conformational change is observed upon Ca(2+) binding, but only minor structural changes take place upon Mg(2+) binding. This suggests that calbindin D(28k) undergoes Ca(2+)-induced structural changes upon Ca(2+) activation of a cell. Thus, calbindin D(28k) displays several properties that would be expected for a protein involved in Ca(2+)-induced signal transmission and hence may function not only as a Ca(2+) buffer but also as a Ca(2+) sensor. Digestion patterns resulting from limited proteolysis of the protein suggest that the loop of EF-hand 2, a variant site that does not bind Ca(2+), becomes exposed upon Ca(2+) binding."

To identify rate-limiting steps in the Kap95p·Kap60p-mediated nuclear import pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we reconstituted key intermediate complexes and measured their rates of dissociation and affinities of interaction. We found that a nuclear localization signal-containing protein (NLS-cargo) dissociates slowly from Kap60p monomers and Kap60p·Kap95p heterodimers with half-lives (t1/2) of 7 and 73 min, respectively; that Kap60p and Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes dissociate slowly from Kap95p (t1/2 = 36 and 73 min, respectively); and that Kap95p·Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes and Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimers dissociate rapidly from the nucleoporin Nup1p (t1/2≤ 21 s) and other Nups. A search for factors that accelerate disassembly of the long-lived intermediates revealed that Nup1p and Nup2p accelerate 16- and 19-fold the rate of dissociation of NLS-cargo from Kap60p·Kap95p heterodimers; that Gsp1p-GTP accelerates ≥ 447-fold the rate of dissociation of Kap60p·NLS-cargo from Kap95p; and that Nup2p and the Cse1p·Gsp1p-GTP complex independently accelerate ≥ 22- and ≥ 39-fold the rate of dissociation of NLS-cargo from Kap60p. We suggest that Nup1p, Nup2p, Cse1p, and Gsp1p accelerate disassembly of Kap95p·Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes by triggering allosteric mechanisms within Kaps that cause rapid release of binding partners. In that way, Nup1p, Nup2p, Cse1p, and Gsp1p may function askaryopherin release factors (or KaRFs) in the nuclear basket structure of the S. cerevisiaeNPC.

A search for factors that accelerate disassembly of the long-lived intermediates revealed that Nup1p and Nup2p accelerate 16- and 19-fold the rate of dissociation of NLS-cargo from Kap60p·Kap95p heterodimers; that Gsp1p-GTP accelerates ≥ 447-fold the rate of dissociation of Kap60p·NLS-cargo from Kap95p; and that Nup2p and the Cse1p·Gsp1p-GTP complex independently accelerate ≥ 22- and ≥ 39-fold the rate of dissociation of NLS-cargo from Kap60p. We suggest that Nup1p, Nup2p, Cse1p, and Gsp1p accelerate disassembly of Kap95p·Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes by triggering allosteric mechanisms within Kaps that cause rapid release of binding partners. In that way, Nup1p, Nup2p, Cse1p, and Gsp1p may function askaryopherin release factors (or KaRFs) in the nuclear basket structure of the S. cerevisiaeNPC.

In general, mobile receptors termed karyopherins (or Kaps; these include importins, exportins, and transportins) bind the nuclear localization signal (NLS) or nuclear export signal (NES) of a cargo molecule and interact with nucleoporins (or Nups; nuclear pore complex proteins) to mediate translocation across the NPC. In the case of the Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimer of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kap60p (Srp1p) binds the NLS of a cargo molecule (NLS-cargo), and Kap95p tethers the Kap60p·NLS-cargo complex to Nups (docking), mediating translocation across the NPC via an unknown mechanism (see Fig. 1). Upon entering the nucleus, the NLS-cargo is released from Kap60p, and Kap95p and Kap60p are recycled separately to the cytoplasm for further rounds of import (5Iovine M.K. Wente S.R. J.

Structural features of the NPC may bias the direction of movement of Kap95p·Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes within the NPC. In S. cerevisiae, the nuclear pore complex is composed of ∼30 distinct nucleoporins (8Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). A subset of the Nups (FG Nups) contains repeats of the dipeptide motif FG, which bind Kaps (9Allen N. Huang L.

Each of the 13 FG Nups of yeast is present in eight or more copies per NPC, and together FG Nups may contribute up to 200 docking sites for karyopherins within the NPC. Eight FG Nups are distributed symmetrically within the NPC (e.g. Nup100p and Nup116p), whereas the rest are localized exclusively to either the cytoplasmic fibers (Nup42p and Nup159p) or the nuclear basket structure (Nup1p, Nup2p, and Nup60p) (8Rout M.P.

In vivo, the FG Nups of the nuclear basket (Nup1p, Nup2p, and Nup60p) are required for efficient Kap95p·Kap60p-mediated nuclear import (12Solsbacher J. Maurer P. Vogel F. Schlenstedt G. Mol. Cell.

These same three Nups, plus the exportin Cse1p in complex with Gsp1p-GTP, are also required for efficient nuclear export of Kap60p in vivo (11Hood J.K. Casolari J.M. Silver P.A. J.

The directionality of karyopherin-mediated transport is also governed by the Gsp1p GTPase (the Ran GTPase in vertebrates) (4Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Binding of Gsp1p-GTP to importins (karyopherins dedicated to nuclear import) disrupts their ability to bind cargoes and Nups and thus terminates nuclear import reactions in the nuclear basket structure of the NPC or in the nucleoplasm (9Allen N. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 17Rexach M. Blobel G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Conversely, exportins (karyopherins dedicated to nuclear export) bind cargoes and Gsp1p-GTP cooperatively to initiate export reactions in the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC (19Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar,20Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Gorlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Export reactions are terminated when Yrb1p stimulates dissociation of Gsp1p-GTP from exportins, and Rna1p stimulates the hydrolysis of GTP by Gsp1p (4Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Because Rna1p is localized to the cytoplasm of yeast (21Hopper A.K. Traglia H.M. Dunst R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the Gsp1p guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Prp20p) is localized to the nucleoplasm (22Ohtsubo M. Okazaki H. Nishimoto T. J. Cell. Bio. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 23Aebi M. Clark M.W. Vijayraghavan U. Abelson J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), a steep concentration gradient of Gsp1p-GTP across the NPC likely exists. Although mechanistic details of Kap95p translocation across the NPC are lacking, it is clear that Kap95p orthologues in vertebrates (importin β and transportin) move at a very rapid rate through the NPC (1–1000 molecules/NPC/second) (1Keminer O. Siebrasse J.P. Zerf K. Peters R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11842-11847Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Ribbeck K. Gorlich D.

It follows that each intermediate step in the nuclear import pathway (e.g. assembly of the Kap95p·Kap60p·NLS-cargo complex, interaction of this complex with Nups, and disassembly of the complex) must occur as fast or faster than the overall rate of transport. Here, we have identified potential rate-limiting steps in the Kap95p·Kap60p-mediated nuclear import pathway by measuring the rate of dissociation of key intermediates. We demonstrate that the nucleoporins Nup1p and Nup2p, the exportin Cse1p, and the GTPase Gsp1p accelerate the disassembly of long-lived intermediates in the pathway. Genes encoding the proteins or protein fragments used were amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA using Taq- or Pfu-driven polymerase chain reactions with designed oligonucleotides that incorporate restriction enzyme sites compatible for ligation into pGEX-2TK in-frame with the 3′ end of the gene encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST). For Kap60p, Kap95p, Cse1p, and Nup2p the entire open reading frame was amplified. For Nup1p, the gene fragment encoding the entire FG repeat region was used to generate Nup1pΔN (amino acids 332–1076), which is missing the NH2 terminus. Full-length Nup1p was not used because it could not be expressed in Escherichia coli. For NLS-cargo, we used the nuclear localization signal of Cbp80p (amino acids 1–30) fused to the COOH terminus of a chimera between GST and the maltose-binding protein (MBP). Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli strains BLR or BL21 Codon Plus (Novagen) and were purified on glutathione-coated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). In each case, 40 ml of a bacterial cell extract prepared from 1000 A600 units of cells was incubated with 1 ml of glutathione-coated Sepharose beads in batch for 1 h at 4 °C (as described in Ref. 9Allen N. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After extensive washing of the column, GST-proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mmMg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% Tween 20 plus 15 mm reduced glutathione), and proteins were concentrated in a Centricon 30 unit (Amicon). Concentrated proteins were aliquoted in 1-mg portions, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. To remove GST, thawed GST fusion proteins were cleaved with thrombin (Calbiochem) at room temperature for specific times. After adding hirudin (Calbiochem) to neutralize thrombin, the samples were applied separately to fast protein liquid chromatography Superdex 200 or Superose 6 columns (Amersham Biosciences), which were equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 2 mm DTT. Peak fractions containing the purified karyopherin, nucleoporin, or NLS-cargo were pooled. Tween 20 was added to 0.1%, and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. His-tagged Gsp1p was purified and charged with GTP as described previously (9Allen N. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 17Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). All assays were performed using recombinant proteins in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% Tween 20). For each experiment, the GST-Nup, -Kap, or -NLS-cargo was incubated in batch with glutathione-Sepharose beads (1–2 μg of GST fusion/10 μl of packed beads; Amersham Biosciences) in 1 ml of binding buffer for 15 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 30 s and washed six times by resuspension in 0.5 ml of binding buffer and sedimentation as before. Two washes were done at room temperature and contained 100 μm ATP to remove any E. coli heat shock proteins that bound to the GST chimera. Washed collected beads were resuspended in a 50% slurry, and the bead slurry was aliquoted in 20-μl portions into siliconized 0.5-ml microtubes (Sigma) that contained protein additions for a total volume of 40 μl. Tubes were then tumbled for 1 h at 4 °C. At the end of the incubations, beads were sedimented at 2000 ×g for 30 s, and unbound proteins in the supernatant fractions were collected by removing 30 μl from the meniscus; this constitutes the unbound fraction. Beads were washed twice and were resuspended with 30 μl of buffer. All samples were finally processed by adding 10 or 12 μl of 6× sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol to the unbound and bound fractions, respectively. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and proteins in one-half of each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein affinities were conducted as described previously (14Denning D. Mykytka B. Allen N. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Purified Kap95p and Kap60p were phosphorylated at an engineered site in their NH2 termini using bovine heart kinase and [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as described in the Amersham Biosciences GST handbook. GST-Kap60p, GST-Nup1pΔN, and GST-NLS-cargo were immobilized separately on beads and incubated with increasing amounts of radiolabeled Kap95p or Kap60p at room temperature in 20 mmHepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mmMg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 1 mg/ml BSA. After incubation, beads were washed quickly, and bound radiolabeled proteins were quantified by liquid scintillation. Binding curves were fit to the data using GraphPad Prism™ software (Biosoft). Dissociation rates were assayed using purified radiolabeled proteins in the bead-based solution binding assay. Kap95p and Kap60p were radiolabeled as above. GST-Kap60p, GST-Nup1pΔN, and GST-NLS-cargo were immobilized separately on beads and incubated for 2 h with radiolabeled Kap95p or Kap60p at room temperature in 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 mg/ml BSA. Unlabeled Kap95p or Kap60p were also present when indicated. 12 μl of the bead mix was diluted into 1.2 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 mg/ml BSA containing various concentrations of competitor proteins. Beginning 10 s after dilution, beads were flash-collected on filters using a vacuum manifold. Bound radiolabeled proteins were eluted with 1% SDS and quantified by scintillation counting. Single exponential dissociation curves were fit to the data using GraphPad Prism™ software (Biosoft). Half-lives of complexes (t1/2) were calculated using the equation t1/2 = ln2/koff. Mean residence time was calculated using the equation 1/koff. Association rate constants were calculated using the equation kon =KD/koff. There is ample cell biological and genetic evidence that the nucleoporins Nup1p and Nup2p, the GTPase Gsp1p, and the exportin Cse1p perform essential functions in the Kap95p·Kap60p-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport pathway, and there is evidence of biochemical interactions among subsets of these proteins (9Allen N.

However, the basic mechanism underlying the function of these proteins in the pathway is not known. Specifically, it has not been resolved whether these proteins function in a passive manner to modulate the interaction of Kap60p and/or Kap95p with other proteins or whether they function in an active manner to trigger allosteric mechanisms in Kap60p and/or Kap95p that accelerate capture or release of bound partners (for example see Fig. 5A). Here we addressed this issue directly by conducting a quantitative analysis of the dynamics of assembly and disassembly of key nuclear import intermediates. An NLS-cargo molecule was constructed as a fusion of the NLS of S. cerevisiae Cbp80p (an mRNA cap-binding protein; amino acids 1–30) and the MBP. We chose the NLS of Cbp80p because it may be the highest affinity endogenous NLS recognized by Kap60p in yeast. This is based on the observation that Cbp80p is one of only two proteins in yeast extracts that remain bound to Kap60p when all other proteins have been removed by extraction (27Gorlich D. Kraft R. Kostka S. Vogel F. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Mattaj I.W. Izaurraide E. Cell. 1996; 87: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The second protein is Nup2p. Nup1p was chosen for this analysis because (i) it binds Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimers with the highest affinity in comparison to other FG Nups tested (9Allen N. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (data not shown), (ii) it functions in the Kap95p·Kap60p transport pathway in vivo (12Solsbacher J. Maurer P. Vogel F. Schlenstedt G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8468-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Belanger K.D. Kenna M.A. Wei S. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and (iii) it resides in the nuclear basket structure of the yeast NPC (8Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 12Solsbacher J. Maurer P. Vogel F. Schlenstedt G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8468-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) where disassembly of import complexes is presumed to occur. Indeed, Nup1p may function as one of the last “stepping stones” (docking sites) in the path of Kap95p·Kap60p-mediated transport (Fig. 1). In addition to its serving as a stepping stone for transport, we demonstrate here that Nup1p accelerates the rate of dissociation of NLS-cargo from Kap60p·Kap95p heterodimers. We used a version of Nup1p that lacks the NH2terminus (Nup1pΔN; amino acids 332–1076) because we could not obtain full-length Nup1p as a recombinant protein. Nonetheless, Nup1pΔN contains all of the FG repeats in Nup1p (9Allen N. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Purified proteins and a solution binding assay were used to reconstitute: (i) the binding of Kap60p to a protein that contains a classic nuclear localization signal (NLS-cargo) in the presence or absence of Kap95p (Fig. 2A), (ii) the binding of Kap95p to its heterodimeric partner Kap60p (Fig. 2B), and (iii) the binding of Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimer (with and without NLS-cargo) to Nup1p (Fig. 2C). Kap60p bound directly to NLS-cargo, and Kap95p was recruited to the complex in a Kap60p-dependent manner as expected (Fig. 2A) (17Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Also, note that purified recombinant Kap60p was ∼100% active in binding NLS-cargo judging from its absence from the unbound fraction (open arrowhead, Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Kap95p bound Kap60p as expected (Fig. 2B) (17Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and was ∼100% active in binding Kap60p judging from its absence from the unbound fraction (open arrowhead, Fig. 2B, bottom panel). When combined, Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimers were able to dock the NLS-cargo to Nup1pΔN (Fig. 2C). Binding affinities of the nuclear import intermediates were quantified using radiolabeled karyopherins in a solution binding assay (Fig. 3). For each affinity experiment, GST-Nups, -Kaps or -NLS-cargo were immobilized on beads and incubated with increasing concentrations of purified radiolabeled Kap95p or Kap60p. Kap95p and Kap60p were labeled with32P at an engineered tag in their NH2 termini, which does not interfere with their functioning (see “Experimental Procedures”) (28Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). After 2 h at 25 °C, beads were collected by centrifugation, and the amount of bound radiolabeled karyopherin was quantified by liquid scintillation. The results are shown in Fig. 3; the diagrams depict the immobilized protein bound to cross-hatched surface, the radiolabeled ligand marked by the radioactivity symbol, and other proteins present in each incubation. Not shown is bovine serum albumin, which was present at 1 mg/ml in these reactions. Kap60p bound to an immobilized NLS-cargo with KD = 2.8 nm (Fig. 3A and Table I). This affinity is similar to the affinity of Kap60p for the SV40 T-antigen NLS (KD = 2 nm) (29Hu W. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15820-15827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Notably, the presence of Kap95p increased by ≥18-fold the affinity of Kap60p for the NLS-cargo (from KD = 2.8 nm to KD ≤ 149 pm) (Fig. 3, A and B). This is consistent with previous results (17Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 30Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and is likely due to the binding of Kap95p to the IBB domain of Kap60p, which otherwise serves as an intramolecular inhibitor of NLS binding (31Catimel B.

The affinity value obtained for the interaction between Kap95p·Kap60p and NLS-cargo (KD ≤ 149 pm) is near the limit of detection of our assay. The actual KDmay be lower (indicated by the ≤ symbol) because reduction of the concentration of immobilized NLS-cargo yielded a lower apparent KD (data not shown). However, loss of signal at reduced concentrations of Kap95p·Kap60p prevented unambiguous quantitation. In such cases, we have reported the most accurate value we could measure.Table IMolecular dynamics of nuclear import intermediatesIntermediate complex in nuclear importMeasured affinity (KD)Measured dissociation rate constant (koff)Calculated association rate constant (kon)Half-life of complexMean interaction time(pm)(s−1)(m−1s−1)(1/koff)*Kap60p · NLS-cargo28001.8 × 10−36.4 × 105394 s556 sKap95p · *Kap60p · NLS-cargo≤1491.6 × 10−4≥1.1 × 10673 min104 min*Kap95p · Kap60p · NLS-cargoND1.6 × 10−4ND73 min104 min*Kap95p · Kap60p≤1533.2 × 10−4≥2.1 × 10636 min52 minNup1pΔN · *Kap95p · Kap60p≤51≥3.3 × 10−2≥6.5 × 108≤21 s≤30 sNup1pΔN · *Kap95p · Kap60p · NLS-cargo400≥3.3 × 10−2≥8.3 × 107≤21 s≤30 sAn asterisk marks radiolabeled proteins, and an underline marks immobilized proteins.

Kap95p bound immobilized Kap60p with KD ≤ 153 pm (Fig. 3C and Table I). This value was near the limit of detection of our assay (as explained above), and so the actual KD for the Kap95p·Kap60p complex may be lower. The interaction of Kap95p with Kap60p is often referred to as a typical karyopherin·cargo interaction because Kap95p binds an NLS-like sequence in Kap60p (the IBB domain). However, it is possible that Kap60p modulates Kap95p function in ways that other cargoes that bind Kap95p directly do not. Kap95p·Kap60p·NLS-cargo complexes bound immobilized Nup1pΔN with KD = 400 pm (Fig. 3D and Table I). Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimers (without NLS-cargo) bound Nup1pΔN with KD ≤ 51 pm (Fig. 3E). The latter value was at the limit of detection of our assay (as explained above), and thus the reported number is an upper bound on the actual KD. As both Kap95p and Kap60p can bind independently to Nup1pΔN (Fig. 2C), in principle both karyopherins could mediate the interaction when binding in heterodimeric form. This may explain the exceptionally high affinity of Kap95p·Kap60p toward Nup1pΔN. The presence of an NLS-cargo bound to Kap60p·Kap95p lowered by ≥8-fold the affinity of Kap95p·Kap60p toward Nup1pΔN (from KD ≤ 51 pm to KD = 400 pm (Fig. 3, D and E; Table I). Because it is possible that different NLSs have different effects on Kap60p·Kap95p interactions with Nups or other proteins, we conducted experiments in the absence and presence of NLS-cargo to offer a comparison between cargo-bound and cargo-free Kap95p·Kap60p. The nuclear import intermediates examined above exhibit high affinities of interaction. These affinities reflect the ratio between the dissociation rate constant (koff) and the association rate constant (kon) of the interacting pairs (KD =koff/kon). Assuming typical association rate constants for protein-protein interactions (107–108m−1s−1) (32Berg O. von Hippel P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) G"

B1 is specifically expressed in kidney and cochlea (19Karet F.E. Finberg K.E. Nelson R.D. Nayir A. Mocan H. Sanjad S.A. Rodriguez-Soriano J. Santos F. Cremers C.W., Di Pietro A. Hoffbrand B.I.

Genet. 1999; 21: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and B2 is expressed ubiquitously.In this study, we have isolated a mouse gene, Atp6e1, coding for a novel isoform (named E1) of the V-ATPase E subunit. E1 exhibits high similarity to ubiquitously expressed E2 (Atp6e2) and is expressed exclusively in the germ cells of testis. We found that a V-ATPase with E1 and a2 isoforms is located specifically in the acrosomal membrane of sperm. This unique V-ATPase is required for an acidic intra-acrosomal pH of 5.3 + 0.1 (20Nakanishi T. Ikawa M. Yamada S. Toshimori K. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which is necessary for processing protease zymogen essential for fertilization.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a novel isoforms (E1and E2) of the mouse V-ATPase E subunit, and the corresponding genes, Atp6e1 and Atp6e2, respectively. In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed E2,E1 was expressed specifically in testis and localized in proacrosomal granules in spermatocytes and acrosomes in developing spermatids and mature sperm. We also found that the A subunit of V1 and a2 of V0 were localized in the same membranes (Figs. 6 and 7), indicating that a unique V-ATPase is present in acrosomes. The E1 as well as the E2 isoform functionally complemented the yeast counterpart vma4 null mutation, indicating that mouse isoforms can assemble with other V-ATPase subunits to form a functional enzyme complex.The acrosome is known to be an acidic secretory vesicle containing hydrolytic enzymes that are involved in the passage of the sperm across the zona pellucida. Thus, the assembly of a proton pump is an essential step for the biogenesis of this unique organelle. The presence of V-ATPase in acrosomes was predicted in a recent review (1Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and suggested by a preliminary experiment (37Kawa G. Yamamoto A. Yoshimori T. Muguruma K. Matsuda T. Moriyama Y. Int. J. Androl. 2000; 23: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The present results clearly indicate that a V-ATPase with specific isoforms E1 and a2 is solely responsible for acrosome acidification. Our results show that E1 is induced concomitantly with the onset of acrosome biogenesis, whereas the ubiquitous E2 isoform is present in spermatocytes but completely absent in late spermatids and mature sperm.Interestingly, the a subunit that is localized on the acrosomal membrane is a2, an isoform localized specifically to Golgi apparatus, not other a isoforms. 3T. Toyomura and M. Futai, manuscript in preparation. This is consistent with the previous morphological observation that the acrosome is formed through the fusion of vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus (38Sinowatz F. Wrobel K.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1981; 219: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,39Hermo L. Rambourg A. Clermont Y. Am. J. Anat. 1980; 157: 357-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, the assembly of V-ATPase with E1 and a2 isoforms is acrosome-specific and essential for its physiological function.Previous studies indicated that the E subunit is essential for the assembly and activity of the yeast V-ATPase (40Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tomashek et al. (41Tomashek J.J. Graham L.A. Hutchins M.U. Stevens T.H. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26787-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the stability of the yeast E subunit protein depended on the presence of the G subunit (VMA10) and proposed that the two V1 subunits may interact as a part of a “stalk” in the V-ATPase. It was reported recently that the E subunit interacts with aldolase and may be involved directly in the coupling of V1V0 assembly and glucose metabolism (42Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, E isoforms may have different roles in V-ATPase activity and assembly. The yeast Δvma4 cells expressing the E1 isoform were temperature-sensitive, whereas those with the E2 could grow at 37 °C. Unexpectedly, the yeast V-ATPase containing the E1 isoform exhibited a temperature-sensitive defect in coupling between proton transport and ATP hydrolysis. The temperature sensitivity may be consistent with the lower optimal temperature (∼33 °C) for the culture of spermatid cells (32Romrell L.J. Bellve A.R. Fawcett D.W. Dev. Biol. 1976; 49: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 33Glassner M. Jones J. Kligman I. Woolkalis M.J. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 438-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The present results also indicate that E subunit is essential for energy coupling, and V-ATPase became temperature-sensitive because the yeast Vma4p was replaced by mouse E1. This notion is also supported by the structure model of V-ATPase which located E subunit at the second stalk connecting catalytic V1 and proton pathway V0 sectors (43Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The presence of E isoforms (named E1 and E2) was observed recently in plants including pea, mung bean, and Arabidopsis thaliana (44Kawamura Y. Arakawa K. Maeshima M. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6515-6522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The two isoforms of had different Km and Vmax values. The plant E1 was hardly detectable in leaves and cotyledons, whereas E2 was expressed ubiquitously. Their expression is different, but neither of them shows highly restricted expression similar to that of mouse E1.We have shown that a unique V-ATPase with E1 and a2 isoforms is involved in the acidification of the acrosomal lumen. Our results also indicate that apparently ubiquitous enzymes become acrosome-specific upon assembly with subunit isoforms E1 and a2. a3 and a4 may play similar roles in osteoclasts and renal intercalated cells (12Toyomura T.

B1 is specifically expressed in kidney and cochlea (19Karet F.E. Finberg K.E. Nelson R.D. Nayir A. Mocan H. Sanjad S.A. Rodriguez-Soriano J. Santos F. Cremers C.W., Di Pietro A. Hoffbrand B.I.

In this study, we have isolated a mouse gene, Atp6e1, coding for a novel isoform (named E1) of the V-ATPase E subunit. E1 exhibits high similarity to ubiquitously expressed E2 (Atp6e2) and is expressed exclusively in the germ cells of testis. We found that a V-ATPase with E1 and a2 isoforms is located specifically in the acrosomal membrane of sperm. This unique V-ATPase is required for an acidic intra-acrosomal pH of 5.3 + 0.1 (20Nakanishi T. Ikawa M. Yamada S. Toshimori K. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which is necessary for processing protease zymogen essential for fertilization. DISCUSSIONWe have identified a novel isoforms (E1and E2) of the mouse V-ATPase E subunit, and the corresponding genes, Atp6e1 and Atp6e2, respectively. In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed E2,E1 was expressed specifically in testis and localized in proacrosomal granules in spermatocytes and acrosomes in developing spermatids and mature sperm. We also found that the A subunit of V1 and a2 of V0 were localized in the same membranes (Figs. 6 and 7), indicating that a unique V-ATPase is present in acrosomes. The E1 as well as the E2 isoform functionally complemented the yeast counterpart vma4 null mutation, indicating that mouse isoforms can assemble with other V-ATPase subunits to form a functional enzyme complex.The acrosome is known to be an acidic secretory vesicle containing hydrolytic enzymes that are involved in the passage of the sperm across the zona pellucida. Thus, the assembly of a proton pump is an essential step for the biogenesis of this unique organelle. The presence of V-ATPase in acrosomes was predicted in a recent review (1Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and suggested by a preliminary experiment (37Kawa G. Yamamoto A. Yoshimori T. Muguruma K. Matsuda T. Moriyama Y. Int. J. Androl. 2000; 23: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The present results clearly indicate that a V-ATPase with specific isoforms E1 and a2 is solely responsible for acrosome acidification. Our results show that E1 is induced concomitantly with the onset of acrosome biogenesis, whereas the ubiquitous E2 isoform is present in spermatocytes but completely absent in late spermatids and mature sperm.Interestingly, the a subunit that is localized on the acrosomal membrane is a2, an isoform localized specifically to Golgi apparatus, not other a isoforms. 3T. Toyomura and M. Futai, manuscript in preparation. This is consistent with the previous morphological observation that the acrosome is formed through the fusion of vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus (38Sinowatz F. Wrobel K.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1981; 219: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,39Hermo L. Rambourg A. Clermont Y. Am. J. Anat. 1980; 157: 357-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, the assembly of V-ATPase with E1 and a2 isoforms is acrosome-specific and essential for its physiological function.Previous studies indicated that the E subunit is essential for the assembly and activity of the yeast V-ATPase (40Ho M.N.

It was reported recently that the E subunit interacts with aldolase and may be involved directly in the coupling of V1V0 assembly and glucose metabolism (42Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, E isoforms may have different roles in V-ATPase activity and assembly. The yeast Δvma4 cells expressing the E1 isoform were temperature-sensitive, whereas those with the E2 could grow at 37 °C. Unexpectedly, the yeast V-ATPase containing the E1 isoform exhibited a temperature-sensitive defect in coupling between proton transport and ATP hydrolysis. The temperature sensitivity may be consistent with the lower optimal temperature (∼33 °C) for the culture of spermatid cells (32Romrell L.J. Bellve A.R. Fawcett D.W. Dev. Biol. 1976; 49: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 33Glassner M. Jones J. Kligman I. Woolkalis M.J. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 438-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The present results also indicate that E subunit is essential for energy coupling, and V-ATPase became temperature-sensitive because the yeast Vma4p was replaced by mouse E1. This notion is also supported by the structure model of V-ATPase which located E subunit at the second stalk connecting catalytic V1 and proton pathway V0 sectors (43Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The presence of E isoforms (named E1 and E2) was observed recently in plants including pea, mung bean, and Arabidopsis thaliana (44Kawamura Y. Arakawa K. Maeshima M. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6515-6522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The two isoforms of had different Km and Vmax values. The plant E1 was hardly detectable in leaves and cotyledons, whereas E2 was expressed ubiquitously. Their expression is different, but neither of them shows highly restricted expression similar to that of mouse E1.We have shown that a unique V-ATPase with E1 and a2 isoforms is involved in the acidification of the acrosomal lumen. Our results also indicate that apparently ubiquitous enzymes become acrosome-specific upon assembly with subunit isoforms E1 and a2. a3 and a4 may play similar roles in osteoclasts and renal intercalated cells (12Toyomura T.

https://openalex.org/W1969674061,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a prominent tumor growth factor for malignant multiple myeloma cells. In addition to its known activation of the Janus tyrosine kinase-STAT and RAS-MEK-ERK pathways, recent work suggests that IL-6 can also activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/AKT kinase pathway in myeloma cells. Because activation of the PI3-K/AKT as well as RAS-MEK-ERK pathways may result in downstream stimulation of the p70S6K (p70) and phosphorylation of the 4E-BP1 translational repressor, we assessed these potential molecular targets in IL-6-treated myeloma cells. IL-6 rapidly activated p70 kinase activity and p70 phosphorylation. Activation was inhibited by wortmannin, rapamycin, and the ERK inhibitors PD98059 and UO126, as well as by a dominant negative mutant of AKT. The concurrent requirements for both ERK and PI3-K/AKT appeared to be a result of their ability to phosphorylate p70 on different residues. In contrast, IL-6-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was inhibited by rapamycin, wortmannin, and dominant negative AKT but ERK inhibitors had no effect, indicating ERK function was dispensable. In keeping with these data, a dominant active AKT mutant was sufficient to induce 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but could not by itself activate p70 kinase activity. Prevention of IL-6-induced p70 activation and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors rapamycin and CCI-779 resulted in inhibition of IL-6-induced myeloma cell growth. These results indicate that both ERK and PI3-K/AKT pathways are required for optimal IL-6-induced p70 activity, but PI3-K/AKT is sufficient for 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Both effects are mediated via mammalian target of rapamycin function, and, furthermore, these effects are critical for IL-6-induced tumor cell growth.

Immunol. 1995; 162: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition, several studies support the importance of IL-6 as a tumor-promoting cytokine in vivo. 1) Serum and bone marrow IL-6 levels are elevated in myeloma patients, and levels correlate with disease activity (3Bataille R. Jourdan M. Zhang X.-G. Klein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar); 2) monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibodies can induce anti-tumor responses (4Bataille R. Lu B. Barlogie Z.-Y. Rossi J.-F. Lavabre-Bertrand T. Beck T. Wijdened J. Brochier J. Klein B. Blood. 1995; 86: 685-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 3) IL-6 expression in mice is an absolute requirement for development of murine myeloma (5Hilbert D. Kopf M. Mock B. Kohler G. Rudikoff S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Because the predominant effect of IL-6 in nontransformed B-lineage cells is that of inducing differentiation (6Muraguchi A. Hirano T. Tang B. Matsuda T. Horii Y. Nakajima K. Kishimoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), a process that normally results in apoptosis of the terminally differentiated plasma cell, there must be inherent differences in IL-6 signaling in malignant plasma cells that result in continued cell growth and viability. These differences could be therapeutically exploited as they may offer a “therapeutic window.” In addition, identification of the signal pathways that mediate IL-6-induced MM cell growth may also provide insight into the critical pathways of IL-6-independent growth. Thus, studies on IL-6-dependent signaling in myeloma cells are important. The IL-6 receptor consists of a ligand-binding molecule (gp80) and gp130, the signal-transducing molecule. Following IL-6 binding to gp80 and subsequent gp130 oligomerization, the receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinase kinases become activated and phosphorylate tyrosine residues on gp130. These phosphorylated residues express docking sites for downstream substrates that bind via their SH2 domains. This process leads to activation of two dominant pathways. One is the STAT family of transcription factors, and gp130 signaling in MM cells specifically results in activation of STAT3 and STAT1. A second distinct pathway is activated via adaptor proteins, which also bind to gp130 and induce downstream activation of p21 RAS (7Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RAS, in turn, activates several additional effector cascades, one of which consists of RAF/MEK/ERK. Some evidence implicates this latter pathway in proliferation of MM cells because IL-6-induced activation of the pathway correlates with induction of proliferation (8Ogata A. Chauhan D. Urashima M.

Anderson K. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2212-2220PubMed Google Scholar). A role for STAT3 activation in expansion of malignant clones may also exist. STAT3 function in the U266 myeloma cell line is critical for protecting against Fas-induced apoptosis (10Catlett-Falcone R. Landowski T. Oshiro M.M Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Moscinski L. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. Dalton W. Jove R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gp130-dependent activation of STAT3 protects against apoptosis that occurs during cell cycle transit in other cell types (11Fukada T Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In prior work, we identified an additional signal cascade, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/AKT kinase pathway, that appears important in IL-6-induced myeloma cell growth. PI3-K/AKT is frequently activated in myeloma plasma cells, and inhibiting either PI3-K activity (12Tu Y. Gardner A. Lichtenstein A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6763-6770PubMed Google Scholar) or AKT activity (13Hsu J.-H. Shi Y. Krajewski S. Renner S. Fisher M. Reed J.C. Franke T. Lichtenstein A. Blood. 2001; 98: 2853-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) curtails IL-6-dependent and -independent tumor cell expansion. The PI3-K/AKT pathway can promote tumor growth by protecting against apoptosis or enhancing proliferation. Although survival responses may be the result of phosphorylation of one or more of many different substrates (14Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T. Stanbridge E. Frisch S.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), stimulation of proliferation is thought to be uniquely the result of downstream signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which results in phosphorylation and activation of the p70S6K (p70) and phosphorylation of the 4E-BP1 translational repressor. p70 activation results in increased phosphorylation of the 40 S ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation disrupts its interaction with the eIF-4E initiation factor, allowing eIF-4E to participate in assembly of a translation initiation complex. These events lead to translational up-regulation of the proteins needed for cell cycle transit. Our prior results indicated that the PI3-K/AKT pathway was more important in MM cell proliferative rather than survival responses (18Hsu J.-H. Hu Y. Shi L. Fisher M. Franke T. Lichtenstein A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1391-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, in the current study, we focused on its possible downstream activation of p70 and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in IL-6-treated MM cells. Because the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway can also mediate p70 (19Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is potentially activated by IL-6 in MM cells, we also tested the role of this cascade in p70/4E-BP1 phosphorylation. The MM cell lines AF-10 and 8226 were kind gifts from Drs. J. Epstein (University of Arkansas, Little Rock, AR) and James Berenson (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). The lines were maintained as previously described (2Tu A. Lichtenstein Y. Fady C. Vescio R. Berenson J. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 162: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 12Tu Y. Gardner A. Lichtenstein A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6763-6770PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant IL-6 and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Phosphospecific antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise described. The N terminus AKT construct HA-AKT (PH), which includes the PH domain but lacks the kinase domain and the HA-E40K construct, which contains a point mutation in its PH domain, have been previously described (21Soonyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11345-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 22Aoki M. Batista O. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P. Vogt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14950-14955Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). A recombinant adenovirus that encodes HA-AKT(PH) or HA-E40K was generated by homologous recombination in bacteria. The HA-tagged constructs were first cloned into pAdTrack-CMV, which also contains the green fluorescent protein gene. The resultant construct was linearized and transformed with the supercoiled adenoviral vector, pAdEasy-1 into Escherichia coli and recombinants selected in kanamycin and screened by restriction endonuclease digestion. The recombinant adenovirus was then transfected into 293 cells. Control pAdTrack-CMV recombinant virus was generated in identical fashion but without transgene insertion. Myeloma cells were transduced with adenovirus at varying m.o.i. values for 2 h. Virus was then washed away, and cells were resuspended in media with low serum concentration (1%) to minimize proliferation. At 24 and 48 h, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fluorescence demonstrated that >85% of cells were successfully transfected when using m.o.i. values between 10 and 100. The AKT in vitro kinase assay utilized a non-radioactive kit purchased from New England Biolabs. AKT was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts and incubated with GSK-3 fusion protein in the presence of ATP and kinase buffer. AKT-dependent GSK-3 phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific GSK-3 antibody. As previously described (23Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand G.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), p70S6K was immunoprecipitated from myeloma cells with C18 antibody (Santa Cruz). p70 was then mixed with S6 substrate peptide (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in kinase buffer in the presence of 200 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of 250 mm EDTA, followed by boiling for 5 min. The reaction mixture was then transferred to phosphocellulose columns (Pierce), which were centrifuged to separate free32P from S6-labeled 32P. The amount of labeled S6 peptide adhered to the columns was then assayed by liquid scintillation. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was detected by differential migration in SDS-PAGE. As previously described (24Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y. Belsham G.J. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5578-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), protein lysates were first boiled and then incubated on ice. After centrifugation, supernatant protein was precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h, followed by two washes with diethyl ether. The pellet was dissolved in Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Membranes were blotted with anti-4E-BP1 antibody from Santa Cruz Chemicals. MM cells were cultured at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 6- or 12-well plates. Some groups were pretreated with rapamycin or CCI-779 for 2 h before adding IL-6 at 100 units/ml. After 48 h, cells were harvested and viable recovery determined by trypan blue staining. To assess the activation and roles of p70/4E-BP1 phosphorylation in IL-6-stimulated MM cells, we primarily used the AF-10 MM cell line for these studies for the following reasons. 1) Although the line can grow in the absence of IL-6, addition of exogenous IL-6 reproducibly increases proliferation; 2) the two dominant IL-6 signal pathways that are classically stimulated in MM cells, STAT1/STAT3 activation and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK activation, are consistently activated in AF-10 cells; and 3) IL-6 rapidly activates PI3-K and AKT in these cells. In addition, AF-10 cells have functional IGF-1 receptors, allowing us to use IGF-1 stimulation as a positive control for p70/4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Using a p70 in vitro kinase assay, we could demonstrate that IL-6 rapidly activated p70 kinase function (Fig.1A) with kinetics and a magnitude that was similar to that achieved with IGF-1. IL-6-stimulated activity developed between 5 and 15 min of incubation and peaked at 15 min (2.5-fold over unstimulated control cells). Activity slightly decreased by 30 min (2.1-fold over control) and returned to base line by 60 min (1.2-fold of control; data not shown). The results shown in Fig. 1 were obtained from cells stimulated with 100 units/ml IL-6. This was optimal IL-6-induced stimulation, as experiments using 1000 units/ml did not result in greater kinase stimulation, whereas 1 and 10 units/ml were less effective (data not shown). IGF-1 likewise stimulated kinase activity in AF-10 cells. Pretreatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin completely abrogated the ability of both IL-6 and IGF-1 to activate kinase activity (Fig. 1A). IL-6-induced p70 kinase activity correlated with IL-6-induced p70 phosphorylation. Utilizing phosphospecific p70 antibodies and IGF-1 treatment as a positive control, we could show that IL-6 induced phosphorylation at serine 411, threonine 421/serine 424, and threonine 389 (Fig. 1B). These are critical residues, phosphorylation of which results in optimal p70 kinase activity. Clear induction of phosphorylation was seen by 15 min of incubation. As shown, pretreatment with rapamycin prevented phosphorylation of all these residues. Thus, as for p70 kinase activity, mTOR regulates IL-6-dependent p70 phosphorylation. IL-6 is capable of activating the PI3-K/AKT pathway (12Tu Y. Gardner A. Lichtenstein A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6763-6770PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (8Ogata A. Chauhan D. Urashima M. Teoh G. Hatziyanni M. Vidiriales V.M.B. Schlossman R. Anderson K. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2212-2220PubMed Google Scholar, 9Daeipour M. Kumar G. Amaral M.C. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4743-4750PubMed Google Scholar) pathway in MM cells. To specifically test activation of these pathways in the AF-10 MM cell line, we exposed cells to IL-6 (100 units/ml) for varying durations and performed Western blot for the phosphorylated, activated form of AKT or p42/p44 ERK. In five separate experiments, exposure to IL-6 consistently induced phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in AF-10 cells. In Fig.2A, results of two of these experiments are shown. In the left panel, p42 ERK demonstrates an increase in phosphorylation by 5 min, which increases to maximal levels by 30 min, and p44 ERK also demonstrates maximal phosphorylation by 30 min. In the second experiment shown (right panel), maximal phosphorylation is again demonstrated by 30 min of IL-6 exposure, although the major effect (in this experiment) was on p44 ERK (3.9-fold increase by densitometry) as compared with p42 (only 2.1-fold increase). Similarly, IL-6 markedly induced AKT phosphorylation at 15 and 30 min (one representative experiment shown in Fig. 2B). In these experiments, we also tested the effectiveness and specificity of wortmannin, a PI3-K inhibitor, and UO126 and PD98059, two unrelated MEK/ERK inhibitors. Preliminary experiments identified the range of concentrations that effectively inhibit either AKT or ERK phosphorylation. We then tested effective lower concentrations of the inhibitors to test the specificity of inhibition. At 0.1 μm, wortmannin (W) completely abrogated IL-6-dependent AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 2B) but had no effect on ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A,right panel). In contrast, UO126 (UO) at 12.5 μm, and PD98059 (PD) at 50 μm, completely inhibited IL-6-dependent ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, left panel) but had no effect on AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). We next used these inhibitors at the same effective and specific concentrations to test effects on p70S6 kinase activity. p70 in vitro kinase activity in AF-10 cells stimulated by IL-6 was increased 2.4-fold (mean of four experiments) over control nonstimulated cells in this set of experiments (Fig.3A). In the presence of wortmannin (W), UO126 (UO), and PD98059 (PD), the IL-6-induced increase was significantly curtailed (only 1.2-, 1.35-, and 1.4-fold increase over control non-IL-6-stimulated cells, respectively; p < 0.05; Fig. 3A). These data confirmed involvement of PI3-K and MEK/ERK in p70 activation. To test involvement of AKT, we expressed a dominant negative AKT construct in AF-10 cells by adenoviral transfection. Our adenoviral vector expresses EGFP, which allowed us to test transfection efficiency in AF-10 cells. Fluorescent microscopy demonstrated very effective transfection efficiency at low m.o.i. (>85% at m.o.i. 10). The dominant negative HA-tagged AKT construct, termed PH (21Soonyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11345-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), was transfected into AF-10 cells, and anti-HA immunoblots as well as AKTin vitro kinase assays in IL-6-treated cells demonstrated expression of the truncated PH construct (Fig. 3B) and inhibition of IL-6-induced activation of endogenous AKT (Fig.3C). p70 in vitro kinase assays also demonstrated a significant inhibition (p < 0.05) of IL-6-induced p70 kinase activity in PH-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). As shown, EGFP control-transfected cells still were capable of increasing their p70 activity to >2-fold increase over non-IL-6-treated cells, whereas dominant negative PH-transfected AF-10 cells only could increase activity to 1.2-fold over control when exposed to IL-6. Thus, the PI3-K/AKT pathway and the MEK/ERK pathway both regulate IL-6-dependent p70 kinase activity. As inhibition of each distinct pathway alone could abrogate p70 activity, the results suggest that the two pathways are additive or synergistic rather than overlapping. The p70 kinase is activated by hierarchical phosphorylation at multiple sites (25Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Initial phosphorylation at serine 411, threonine 421, and serine 424 in the auto-inhibitory domain relieves pseudosubstrate suppression. Activation also requires subsequent PI3-K-dependent phosphorylation at threonine 389 in the adjacent linker domain. These events then synergize to allow phosphorylation at threonine 229 in the catalytic domain. Phosphorylation at Thr229 then results in optimal kinase activity. Thus, one possible explanation for a concurrent requirement of MEK/ERK and PI3-K/AKT in p70 activation was that each pathway was necessary for differential phosphorylation steps on different residues of p70 to allow full activation. We, again, used the phosphospecific p70 antibodies to test this hypothesis. Initial p70 phosphorylation on Thr421/Ser424 in the auto-inhibitory domain was activated by IL-6 after 15 and 30 min of incubation and returned toward base line at 60 min (Fig.4, A and B). Wortmannin, used in concentrations that abrogated AKT activation, had no effect on Thr421/Ser424 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the MEK/ERK inhibitors PD98059 and UO126 both inhibited Thr421/Ser424phosphorylation induced by IL-6 (Fig. 4B). These data support the hypothesis that IL-6-induced phosphorylation of p70 on Thr421/Ser424 is dependent upon signaling through RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK. Further evidence that the PI3-K/AKT pathway was not critical for IL-6-dependent Thr421/Ser424 phosphorylation was obtained with use of the PH dominant negative-expressing adenovirus. As shown in Fig.4C, there was no effect on IL-6-dependent Thr421/Ser424 phosphorylation when AF-10 cells were transfected with the PH construct. Thus, although PI3-K/AKT function was critical for p70 kinase activity (Fig. 3) and, as will be shown below, for phosphorylation at other p70 residues, it was not required for Thr421/Ser424 phosphorylation. In contrast to the above results on phosphorylation of Thr421/Ser424, phosphorylation of Ser411 was regulated by both MEK/ERK and PI3-K/AKT pathways. As shown in Fig.5A, IL-6-induced Ser411 phosphorylation was clearly inhibited by pretreatment with PD98059, UO126, and wortmannin. In addition, IL-6-treated, PH-transfected AF-10 cells were incapable of Ser411 phosphorylation compared with EGFP control (C)-transfected cells (Fig. 5B). These data indicate independent regulation of Ser411 phosphorylation by both pathways. Similar results were obtained using the phosphospecific Thr389 anti-p70 antibody. Significant inhibition of IL-6-induced Thr389phosphorylation was afforded by wortmannin, PD98059, and UO126 (Fig. 6A), as well as the PH dominant negative AKT construct (Fig. 6B). Although the above experiments utilizing the PH AKT dominant negative confirm an AKT-dependent pathway for IL-6-induced p70 kinase activation and phosphorylation, the results also suggest an interaction between AKT and the MEK/ERK pathway is required for p70 activity. To further support the notion that AKT must interact with MEK/ERK-dependent events, and, by itself, is insufficient to activate p70, we transfected a dominant active form of AKT, E40K (22Aoki M. Batista O. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P. Vogt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14950-14955Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), which possesses enhanced kinase activity caused by a point mutation resulting in an increased affinity of the PH domain for second messenger phospholipids (22Aoki M. Batista O. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P. Vogt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14950-14955Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). AF-10 cells were transfected with the adenovirus expressing E40K or control virus, and, 24 h later, cells were harvested and assayed. As with the PH dominant negative AKT-expressing adenovirus (above), the transfection efficiency was again very high (>85% at m.o.i. 10). The transfected AKT was constitutively phosphorylated as shown by immunoblot assay (Fig.7B). In addition, the E40K was functional as a kinase inducing BAD phosphorylation and GSK-3 phosphorylation. However, MM cells transfected with E40K at m.o.i. 10 or 100 did not demonstrate heightened p70 kinase activity, even when further stimulated with IL-6 (Fig. 7A). Thus, although experiments with the dominant negative AKT confirmed a requirement for AKT in IL-6-induced p70 activation, activated AKT was not sufficient. Additional immunoblot analyses demonstrated that E40K-transfected cells only demonstrated heightened phosphorylation of the Ser411p70 residue (Fig. 7B, right panel). There was little phosphorylation of Thr421/Ser424 or Thr389 induced by transfection of E40K. To demonstrate that the above results were not peculiar to AF-10 MM cells, we also studied a second MM cell line, 8226, in a limited number of experiments. The 8226 cell line expresses functional IL-6 receptors and is protected against apoptosis by this cytokine (26Xu F.-H. Sharma S. Tu A. Gardner Y. Raitano A. Sawyers C. Lichtenstein A. Blood. 1998; 92: 241-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several signal transduction pathways are modulated by IL-6 in 8226 cells, and, most importantly, AKT activation is induced (12Tu Y. Gardner A. Lichtenstein A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6763-6770PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the 8226 MM line expresses a mutated ras oncogene and constitutively activated ERK1 and ERK2 (26Xu F.-H. Sharma S. Tu A. Gardner Y. Raitano A. Sawyers C. Lichtenstein A. Blood. 1998; 92: 241-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that IL-6 activated p70 kinase activity in 8226 cells by 15 and 30 min of incubation (Fig.8A). At 15 min the increase was at 1.7-fold of control (untreated 8226 cells) and, at 30 min, it was 2.2-fold of control. Wortmannin (0.1 μm), PD98059 (50 μm), and rapamycin (100 nm) all significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited activation of the kinase in 8226 cells. As the transfection efficiency with adenoviral vectors was as high in 8226 cells (>90% at m.o.i. 10) as it was in AF-10 MM cells, we could test the effect of the dominant negative PH AKT. As shown in Fig. 8B, PH-transfected 8226 cells were incapable of activating p70 kinase activity when exposed to IL-6 (p< 0.05). These data are similar to the above results with the AF-10 MM cell line in demonstrating a requirement for both MEK/ERK function as well as PI3-K/AKT activity in IL-6 induction of p70 activity. A similar pattern of results was seen when phosphorylation of p70 on Thr389 was studied. As shown in Fig. 8C, wortmannin, rapamycin, and PD98059 all curtailed the ability of IL-6 to induce Thr389 phosphorylation on p70 in 8226 cells. The above data in both AF-10 and 8226 MM cells indicated a requirement for the MEK/ERK pathway in p70 phosphorylation on Thr389, a key residue required for optimal induction of kinase activity. To determine whether ERK could directly phosphorylate this residue, we immunoprecipitated p70 from resting AF-10 cells (cultured in the absence of serum) and incubated it in vitrowith activated ERK1 or ERK2 (purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 10 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylation of p70 was then assayed by immunoblot with phosphospecific antibodies. As shown in Fig.9, activated ERK2 and, to a lesser extent, ERK1 were capable of in vitro phosphorylation of Ser411 and Thr421/Ser424 when added at 10 ng/μl reaction. When 10-fold less activated ERK1 and ERK2 was added, little substrate phosphorylation was seen (data not shown). In contrast, activated ERKs could not phosphorylate Thr389 on the immunoprecipitated p70 (Fig. 9). These data indicate ERK is incapable of directly phosphorylating Thr389 and suggest that the MEK/ERK requirements for Thr389 phosphorylation are the result of phosphorylation at the other residues, which allow access of Thr389 to different kinases.

Four enzymes of this type, termed BdbA, BdbB, BdbC, and BdbD, have been identified in the Gram-positive eubacteriumBacillus subtilis.

Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive soil bacterium that is particularly well known for its high protein secretion potential (1.Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. Jongbloed J.D. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 515-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 2.Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives. 1st Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2001Crossref Google Scholar). A small group of secreted Bacillusproteins is formed by lantibiotics, small post-translationally modified peptides that exhibit antimicrobial activity (3.McAuliffe O. Ross R.P. Hill C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 285-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Sahl H.G. Bierbaum G. Annu. Rev.

In general, lantibiotics are characterized by the presence of the unusual amino acids 2,3-didehydroalanine and/or 2,3-didehydrobutyrine, which are formed by dehydration of serine and threonine residues, respectively (6.Guder A. Wiedemann I. Sahl H.G. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). With neighboring cysteine residues they can form a lanthionine (2,3-didehydroalanine) or 3-methyllanthionine bridge (2,3-didehydrobutyrine). To date two lantibiotics of B. subtilis have been characterized in detail. These are subtilin from B. subtilis ATCC 6633 (7.Chung Y.J. Steen M.T. Hansen J.N. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kiesau P. Eikmanns U. Gutowski-Eckel Z. Weber S. Hammelmann M. Entian K.-D. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23134-23142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, two lantibiotic-like peptides originating from the ericin gene cluster of B. subtilis A1/3 were recently described (10.Stein T. Borchert S. Conrad B. Feesche J. Hofemeister B. Hofemeister J. Entian K.-D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1703-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Notably sublancin 168 displays the extraordinary characteristic of having two disulfide bonds in addition to a β-methyllanthionine bridge (Fig. 1). Sublancin 168, specified by sunA, was identified as a type AII lantibiotic by Paik et al. (9.Paik S.H. Chakicherla A. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23134-23142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) in 1998. Presumably it acts by forming pores in the cytoplasmic membrane of a sensitive organism (11.Saris P.E. Immonen T. Reis M. Sahl H.G. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 69: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Type AII lantibiotics are characterized by a “double glycine” GG, GA, or GS motif in their leader sequence, GS in sublancin 168, which is preceded by conserved EL or EV and EL or EM sequences. Cleavage occurs immediately behind the double glycine motif during transport by a dual-function transporter that also has leader peptidase activity. The leader is thought to prevent the lantibiotic from becoming active before translocation (12.van der Meer J.R. Rollema H.S. Siezen R.J. Beerthuyzen M.M. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3555-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Chakicherla A. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23533-23539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The sunTgene, which is located directly downstream of sunA, encodes a protein possessing features of a dual-function ATP-binding cassette transporter with a proteolytic domain and an ATP-binding cassette. These domains are common among lantibiotic transporters (3.McAuliffe O. Ross R.P. Hill C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 285-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly the sublancin 168 operon appears to include thebdbA and bdbB genes (bdb for B acillus disulfide bond) downstream of sunT (Fig. 2). The corresponding BdbA and BdbB proteins were previously identified by Bolhuis et al. (14.Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and have been implicated in thiol-disulfide redox reactions. BdbA shows sequence similarity to the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase Bdb ofBacillus brevis (15.Bolhuis A. Venema G. Quax W.J. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol.

BdbB was shown to be involved in the folding of PhoA of E. coli upon the expression of this secretory protein in B. subtilis. As PhoA contains two disulfide bonds, this indicates that BdbB is involved in disulfide bond formation. However, compared with its paralogue BdbC, BdbB was less important for the folding of PhoA (15.Bolhuis A. Venema G. Quax W.J. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol.

These observations prompted us to investigate whether BdbA, BdbB, and BdbC have a role in the production of functional sublancin 168 in particular because this lantibiotic contains two disulfide bonds. The present results show that BdbB and BdbC are involved in the production of active sublancin 168, whereas BdbA is not required. The finding that thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases are required for the synthesis of a peptide antibiotic has never been reported. Table I lists the plasmids and strains used.

Open table in a new tab Procedures for DNA purification, restriction, ligation, agarose gel electrophoresis, and transformation of competent E. coli DH5α cells were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Enzymes were from Invitrogen. B. subtilis was transformed as described by Kunst and Rapoport (19.Kunst F. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of primers (5′–3′) used for PCR are listed below; nucleotides identical to genomic template DNA are printed in capital letters, restriction sites used for cloning are underlined, and nucleotides used for PCR-mediated coupling are in bold. To construct B. subtilis ΔbdbA, splicing by overlap extension (20.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar) was used. Two fragments flanking thebdbA gene were amplified and ligated into the chromosomal integration and excision plasmid pORI280 (21.Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) after PCR-mediated coupling or ligation. The upstream fragment bdbAfr of 811 nucleotides was amplified using the primers bdbAfr1 (GCA ATCAGA TCT TCA GCA GGC AC) and bdbAfr2 (gtt tca tac tag tta gct aat taa tca TAT AGA ATA CTC CTT ATT TTC CGA GTA GCT CG). The downstream fragment bdbAbk of 1034 nucleotides was amplified with the primers bdbAbk1 (gta ttc tat atg att aat tag cta act agt ATG AAA CTG AGT GAT ATT TAT TTG G) and bdbAbk2 (CAA AAT TGCAGA TCT AAA GTA ATC AAC). The resulting plasmid, pORIbdbA, was first inserted into the chromosome of B. subtilis 168 by a Campbell-type integration. Upon growth in the absence of erythromycin, B. subtilis ΔbdbA was obtained due to the spontaneous excision of the plasmid from the chromosome together with the bdbA gene. Correct integration and excision was verified by Southern hybridization. Note that thebdbA deletion is designed in such a way that thesunT gene remains intact despite the fact that these genes overlap with four nucleotides. To construct B. subtilis ΔbdbA s+, the carboxyl-terminal part of the sunT gene was amplified with the oligonucleotides sunTrec1 (cgc aca agc tTG TAG CAA AGG CAG TTA TTA GC) and sunTrec2 (CAA TCC gga tcc TCA TAT AGA ATA CTC CTT ATT TTC CG) and ligated into pMutin2 to construct the plasmid pMsunTrec. pMsunTrec was integrated into the chromosome ofB. subtilis at the sunT locus by a Campbell-type integration (single crossover) resulting in B. subtilisΔbdbA s+. To construct B. subtilis bdbB-XbdbB, thebdbB gene was amplified using the primers yolK1 (CTC CACtcT Aga GAA CAC GTC CTG AAA GGA ATT GAA GTA TG) and yolKm2 (cgg att acc gga tcc tca gtt cag gtc ctc ctc gct gat aag ttt ttg ttc ATT ATA TAC ATG TTG ATT TTG TTT T). The amplified fragment was ligated into plasmid pX downstream of the xylA promoter. This vector was integrated into the amyE locus of B. subtilis bdbB by double crossover recombination resulting in the strain B. subtilis bdbB-XbdbB. To construct B. subtilis bdbC-Km, 1The abbreviations used are: KmkanamycinDE-MALDI-TOFMSdelayed extraction-matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectra first a pUC18 construct containing the bdbC gene was made. Primers yvgU1 (GAA ATt ctA GAG ACA ATA GAA AAA GAG CTG AAA GGG AAG TAA C) and yvgU3 (GCG CCC GGg ATc CGC GGG CGC TTT TTT TGT TAT TCA GAT TTT TCG CCT TTC AGC AGG CAC) were used to amplify thebdbC gene. This fragment was ligated into the multiple cloning site of pUC18 resulting in pUC18bdbC. TheNsiI site within the bdbC gene was then used to insert a KmR marker that was isolated from pKM1 (laboratory collection; Jan Kiel) using HincII. In this way pUC18bdbCKm was obtained, and this plasmid was subsequently used to transformB. subtilis 168. A double crossover event then led toB. subtilis bdbC-Km in which the bdbC gene is disrupted by the KmR cassette. Correct integration was verified using Southern hybridization. To construct the double mutantB. subtilis bdbB bdbC-Km, the B. subtilis bdbBstrain was transformed with chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis bdbC-Km. kanamycin delayed extraction-matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectra A halo assay was performed on plates with B. subtilis ΔSPβ as indicator strain. This strain was constructed using the sequences with the NCBI accession numbers M81760 and M81762 as described by Lazarevic et al. (22.Lazarevic V. Dusterhoft A. Soldo B. Hilbert H. Mauel C. Karamata D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SPβ-cured B. subtilis strains were previously shown to be sensitive to a bacteriocin (betacin) specified by this prophage (23.Hemphill H.E. Gage I. Zahler S.A. Korman R.Z. Can. J. Microbiol. 1980; 26: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the SPβ region of the B. subtilis 168 chromosome indicated that this bacteriocin is specified by a gene (yolG; Ref. 22.Lazarevic V. Dusterhoft A. Soldo B. Hilbert H. Mauel C. Karamata D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which is now known as the gene for sublancin 168 (sunA). Thus, the SPβ-cured strain lacks thesunA gene and the as yet unidentified sublancin 168 resistance gene(s). The indicator strain and the mutant strains were grown overnight on TY with the appropriate antibiotic(s). The overnight culture of the indicator strain was then diluted 100-fold in TY, and 100 μl was subsequently plated. After drying the plate, 1-μl aliquots of the overnight cultures of the relevant mutant strains were spotted, and the plates were incubated overnight. The next day plates were analyzed for halo formation. In this assay, the presence of antibiotics in the overnight cultures did not result in halo formation. Importantly variations in the halo size of different colonies of the same strain were insignificant, in particular when these colonies were present on one plate. DE-MALDI-TOFMS were recorded on a Voyager-RP-DE instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems) using a 337 nm nitrogen laser for desorption and ionization. All experiments were carried out with the linear positive ion mode. The total acceleration voltage was 25 kV; 23.6 kV was used on the first grid. The delay time was 250 ns. 1-ml aliquots of culture supernatants and media were extracted with 200 μl of 1-butanol. 150 μl of the butanolic phase was dried in a Speed-Vac evaporator, and extracted peptides were dissolved in 20 μl of solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 20% acetonitrile in water (v/v)) and adsorbed to 1 μl of POROS 50 R2 (PerSeptive) beads prepared as a microcolumn as described by Kussmannet al. (24.Kussmann M. Nordhoff E. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Haebel S. Rossel-Larsen M. Jakobsen L. Gobom J. Mirgorodskaya E. Kroll-Kristensen A. Palm L. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). After washing with 20 μl of solvent A, the peptides were eluted with 4 μl of a mixture of 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (v/v). Sample preparation for MALDI was performed with the solution phase nitrocellulose method described by Landry et al. (25.Landry F. Lombardo C.R. Smith J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Between 100 and 250 single scans were accumulated for each mass spectrum. Similarity searches were performed with the standard protein-protein BLAST algorithm (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) at NCBI (26.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) using Swiss-Prot as the data base. Transmembrane segments in SunT were predicted using the TMHMM algorithm version 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/) from the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis (CBS) (27.Moller S. Croning M.D. Apweiler R. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). As a first approach to characterize the factors involved in the production of sublancin 168, the production of this lantibiotic by a sunTmutant strain was tested. It has to be noted that the sunTstrain contains a pMutin2 disruption in the 3′ end of sunT, placing the downstream bdbA, yolJ, andbdbB genes under the control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible Pspac promoter (Fig. 3). Aliquots of an overnight culture ofB. subtilis sunT were spotted on a plate with the sublancin 168-sensitive indicator strain B. subtilis ΔSPβ. It was found that B. subtilis sunT completely lacked sublancin 168 activity (Fig. 4) also after induction of bdbA,yolJ, and bdbB transcription by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (data not shown). The latter observation shows that the lack of sublancin 168 production is not caused by a polar effect on the transcription of the genes located downstream of sunT. Taken together these results demonstrate that SunT is essential for the production of active sublancin 168. In what follows, this conclusion is corroborated by mass spectrometry.Figure 4Sublancin 168 production in B. subtilis 168 and a sunT mutant. From a 100-fold-diluted overnight culture of the B. subtilisΔSPβ indicator strain, 100 μl was plated. After drying of the plate, 1-μl aliquots of overnight cultures of the strains to be tested for sublancin 168 production were spotted, and subsequently the plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Sublancin 168 activity is visualized by halo formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether BdbB is involved in the production of sublancin 168, the halo assay with the ΔSPβ indicator strain was performed as described above. Indeed, B. subtilis bdbB showed a significantly decreased cell killing activity compared with the parental strain 168, indicating that BdbB is involved in the production of sublancin 168 (Fig. 5). The effect of the bdbB mutation was particularly evident when the cells were grown in the presence of 1% xylose, which is in accord with the observation that xylose affects sublancin 168 production or activity already in the parental strain (Fig. 5, compare the halo size ofB. subtilis 168 in the presence and absence of xylose). To determine whether the decreased sublancin 168 activity in B. subtilis bdbB was a direct consequence of the disruption ofbdbB, we constructed B. subtilis bdbB-XbdbB, in which the bdbB gene is ectopically expressed from a xylose-inducible promoter. As shown in Fig. 5, the ectopically expressed bdbB gene fully restored the production of active sublancin 168 in the presence of xylose. Thus, BdbB is important but not essential for the production of sublancin 168. The residual activity of sublancin 168 upon disruption of the bdbB gene suggested that another protein was at least partly able to fulfill the role of BdbB. Especially BdbC was a likely candidate because of its high degree of sequence similarity with BdbB (15.Bolhuis A. Venema G. Quax W.J. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24531-24538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possible effect of a bdbC disruption on sublancin production was tested. In contrast to the bdbB mutant, the bdbC mutant produced sublancin 168 at levels that were comparable to those produced by the parental strain (Fig. 6). However, the strain with the bdbB and bdbC genes both disrupted did not display any sublancin 168 activity. This leads to the conclusion that BdbC is not required for production of sublancin 168 when BdbB is present. Nevertheless, BdbC can partly replace BdbB in the absence of the latter. To investigate the role of BdbA in sublancin 168 production a strain with a clean bdbA deletion was constructed and subsequently tested for sublancin 168 production. This strain did not show any sublancin 168 activity (Fig. 7). However, also when this strain was provided with a bdbA gene that was ectopically expressed from a xylose-inducible promoter, sublancin 168 production was not restored (data not shown). This indicated thatbdbA, unlike sunT, is not essential for this process. As shown in Fig. 3, the sunT and bdbAgenes are partially overlapping. Thus, the 3′ end of thesunT gene might have been damaged during the construction of the clean bdbA deletion strain. Alternatively the deletion of bdbA might interfere with the expression of its downstream genes resulting in reduced levels of active sublancin 168. Therefore, a pMutin2-based integration plasmid containing the 3′ end ofsunT was constructed. Upon a Campbell-type integration of this plasmid (pMsunTrec), the 3′ end of sunT was replaced with the experimentally verified correct sequence. Simultaneously the downstream genes of bdbA were placed under the control of the Pspac promoter. Subsequently we determined whether sublancin 168 activity in the resulting strain ΔbdbA s+ was restored. This was indeed the case as depicted in Fig. 7. The observed sublancin 168 production by this strain, which lacks bdbA, implies that BdbA is dispensable for the production of this lantibiotic. In addition to sublancin 168, another bacteriocin of B. subtilis 168 is known for which the presence of a disulfide bond has been proposed initially: subtilosin (28.Zheng G. Hehn R. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3266-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Subtilosin (29.Babasaki K. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Kurahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 585-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) is composed of 35 amino acids, including three cysteines. Despite the presence of these cysteines, a recent structural analysis of subtilosin by two-dimensional 1H NMR provided no evidence for disulfide bond formation in this bacteriocin (30.Marx R. Stein T. Entian K.-D. Glaser S.J. J. Protein Chem. 2001; 20: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the Bdb proteins might, nevertheless, be involved in the synthesis of subtilosin, DE-MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analyses were performed. Notably this allowed the parallel monitoring of the presence of both subtilosin and sublancin 168 in supernatants of bdbmutant strains. As shown in Fig. 8, subtilosin was identified by its proton-adduct atm/z 3403.3 (average mass; Ref. 30.Marx R. Stein T. Entian K.-D. Glaser S.J. J. Protein Chem. 2001; 20: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The presence of sublancin 168 is indicated by a signal at m/z3881.2 (average mass), which is in good accordance withm/z 3877.8 observed for purified sublancin (Ref.9.Paik S.H. Chakicherla A. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23134-23142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar; data not shown). The data demonstrate that subtilosin production is not affected in the bdb mutant. Furthermore, the mass spectrometry results concerning sublancin 168 are in accord with the results from the halo assays. Interestingly supplementation of the medium with xylose leads to the appearance of additional signals with appreciably higher masses (+132 and +264 Da) than observed in medium without xylose. This observation can be interpreted with a covalent modification of subtilosin and sublancin 168, suggesting that both bacteriocins are modified under these conditions. In conclusion, the present observations show that SunT and BdbB are major determinants for the production of sublancin 168, whereas the production of subtilosin does not depend on these proteins. In this report we show for the first time that the presence of at least one thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, BdbB or BdbC, is required for the production of active sublancin 168. Notably BdbB is of major importance for this process, whereas the involvement of BdbC is only evident in the absence of BdbB. Whether BdbB and BdbC are directly or indirectly involved in sublancin 168 production has yet to be determined. The presence of two disulfide bonds in this lantibiotic makes it conceivable that BdbB and BdbC are directly involved in its folding. However, alternative indirect effects on sublancin 168 folding or maturation cannot be excluded. For example, it is conceivable that BdbB and BdbC act on SunT because this protein contains 10 cysteine residues. SunT belongs to a large family of ATP-binding cassette transporters involved in the processing and export of lantibiotics and other bacteriocins (31.Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). Consistently our present findings show that SunT is required for the production of sublancin 168. Although most ATP-binding cassette transporters appear to contain six transmembrane segments, the bacteriocin transporters are generally characterized by four transmembrane domains (32.Fath M.J. Kolter R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 995-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these transporters have a carboxyl-terminal ATP-binding site (33.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar), which is located in the cytoplasm. Specifically SunT shows a high level of sequence similarity to MesD of Leuconostoc mesenteroides (34.Fremaux C. Hechard Y. Cenatiempo Y. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and LcnC ofLactococcus lactis (35.Stoddard G.W. Petzel J.P. van Belkum M.J. Kok J. McKay L.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 1952-1961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the transporters for mesentericin Y105 and lactococcin A, respectively. For LcnC a detailed topology analysis was performed by Franke et al. (36.Franke C.M. Tiemersma J. Venema G. Kok J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8484-8490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) indicating that this protein has four transmembrane segments. Computer-assisted predictions suggest that SunT, like LcnC, contains four transmembrane sequences, an amino-terminal cytoplasmic peptidase domain (36.Franke C.M. Tiemersma J. Venema G. Kok J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8484-8490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and one carboxyl-terminal ATP-binding domain. A fifth hydrophobic domain, which is conserved in LcnC, is probably not spanning the membrane as this would localize the ATP-binding domain at the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane (Fig. 9). Importantly all 10 cysteine residues of SunT have a predicted cytoplasmic localization, which makes them unlikely substrates for BdbB or BdbC, the catalytic domains of which are localized at the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane (15.Bolhuis A. Venema G. Quax W.J. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24531-24538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Consequently an indirect influence of BdbB or BdbC via SunT on sublancin 168 appears to be unlikely. Apart from the fact that the SPβ prophage is required for immunity against sublancin 168, it is presently not known how this immunity is acquired. In general, two distinct systems for immunity against bacteriocins have been described. The first makes use of dedicated “immunity” proteins, small proteins that are weakly associated with the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane thereby preventing pore formation (11.Saris P.E. Immonen T. Reis M. Sahl H.G. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 69: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37.Siegers K. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The second is constituted of ATP-binding cassette transporters (39.McLaughlin R.E. Ferretti J.J. Hynes W.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 175: 171-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Peschel A. Gotz F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 531-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Klein C. Entian K.-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2793-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this light, SunT could represent a sublancin 168 immunity system that actively prevents the accumulation of this lantibiotic in the membrane (22.Lazarevic V. Dusterhoft A. Soldo B. Hilbert H. Mauel C. Karamata D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, our preliminary data show that the sunT mutant used in the present studies is resistant against sublancin 168, which suggests that SunT is not involved. Likewise, BdbA, BdbB, and BdbC are not required for immunity (data not shown). Although the bdbA gene partly overlaps with the upstreamsunT gene, the deletion of this gene in the ΔbdbA S+ strain did not affect the production of active sublancin 168. This is remarkable because BdbA is the equivalent of Bdb of B. brevis, which can replace the major oxidase DsbA of E. coli (16.Ishihara T. Tomita H. Hasegawa Y. Tsukagoshi N. Yamagata H. Udaka S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The fact that BdbA is dispensable for sublancin production does not exclude its possible involvement in this process. For example, another as yet unidentified thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase might complement for the absence of BdbA, similar to what we have shown for BdbC. One of the candidates could be BdbD, which cooperates with BdbC in competence development (42.Meima R. Eschevins C. Fillinger S. Bolhuis A. Hamoen L.W. Dorenbos R. Quax W.J. van Dijl J.M. Provvedi R.

Both proteins, which are encoded by the bicistronicbdbDC operon, are required for the folding of ComGC most likely because this component of the DNA uptake machinery contains an intramolecular disulfide bond, which is essential for its role in competence (43.Chung Y.S. Breidt F. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The fact that subtilosin production is not affected in the mutants studied is fully consistent with the recently published structure of this peptide antibiotic (30.Marx R. Stein T. Entian K.-D. Glaser S.J. J. Protein Chem. 2001; 20: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). According to this model, subtilosin has three inter-residue bridges in which its cysteine residues are involved. Two cysteines are linked with phenylalanine residues, and one is linked with a threonine. This raises the intriguing question of how subtilosin molecules escape from disulfide bond formation during their export in contrast to sublancin 168 molecules. Strikingly, both for subtilosin and sublancin 168, molecule species were observed with increased molecular mass when B. subtilis bdbB-XbdbB was grown in the presence of 1% xylose. This unprecedented finding shows that subtilosin as well as sublancin 168 can undergo growth medium-dependent modifications. Based on the observed mass increases, it is possible that subtilosin has one xylose adduct (+132 Da), whereas sublancin 168 has either one (+132 Da) or two (+264 Da) of these adducts. Notably Paik et al. (9.Paik S.H. Chakicherla A. Hansen J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23134-23142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) have previously reported a modification of sublancin 168 that increases its mass with 164.48 Da. The precise nature of these modifications and their effect on bactericidal activity remain to be elucidated. In conclusion, the present observations show for the first time an involvement of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases in the production of a peptide antibiotic. Furthermore, our results reveal an important function of the BdbB and BdbC proteins in the B. subtiliscell. Thus far the BdbB protein was only known to be involved in the folding of the heterologous secretory protein PhoA, whereas BdbC was shown to be required for competence development in addition to the secretion of the heterologous protein PhoA (15.Bolhuis A.

Our ongoing research is focused on the identification of the determinants for the substrate specificities of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases ofB. subtilis, BdbB and BdbC in particular. For this purpose, it will be of major importance to answer the question of whether BdbB is directly or indirectly involved in the formation of the disulfide bonds of sublancin 168.

Lancet. 1981; 2: 910-911Abstract PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The effects of fluoride on cariogenic Streptococcus mutans and other bacteria have been extensively studied. Fluoride inhibits enolase, a glycolytic enzyme (5.Kaufmann M. Bartholmes P. Caries Res. 1992; 26: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6.Curran T.M. Buckley D.H. Marquis R.E.

Oral Sci. 2001; 109: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the effects of fluoride on group A Streptococci have not been examined. To examine simultaneous changes in multiple virulence factors, we performed a proteomic analysis of S. pyogenes exposed to fluoride. Western blotting and other immunological methods have been successfully used to study protein expression of various microorganisms, cells, and tissues. However, these techniques are constrained by the limited number of proteins that can be studied in each experiment and the availability of specific antibodies. Proteomic techniques date to 1975, when two-dimensional PAGE was simultaneously described by O'Farrell and Klose (11.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Klose J. Kobalz U. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1034-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and applied to the study of a large number of proteins simultaneously. In two-dimensional PAGE proteins are separated by differential isoelectric point (pI) for the first dimension and by differential weight average molecular weight (M̄ w ) for the second dimension. Using this technique, 1100 protein components have been resolved from Escherichia coli (11.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, up to 10,000 protein forms have been visualized by high resolution two-dimensional PAGE (12.Klose J. Kobalz U. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1034-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The high throughput analysis by mass spectrometry of proteins separated with two-dimensional PAGE has permitted analysis of proteins on a “genomic” scale (13.Jungblut P. Wittmann-Liebold B. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 41: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a process that has acquired the name “proteomics” (14.Anderson N.L. Anderson N.G. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). We have used this approach to construct an initial proteome map of S. pyogenes and to determine whether fluoride alters protein expression of S. pyogenes. In this initial analysis, 74 spots representing 60 unique proteins were identified. Fluoride caused S. pyogenes to decrease expression of several virulence factor proteins, including M protein, GAPDH, and deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP)-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose-3,5-epimerase, but did not alter cell viability. These proteomic data suggest the hypothesis that fluoride might inhibit S. pyogenes virulence factors and post-infectious inflammatory disorders. acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis isoelectric point matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry chemically defined medium dithiothreitol α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase weight average molecular weight 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid N-[2-hy-droxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine heat-shock protein S. pyogenes M5 was employed throughout this study. The streptococci were grown either in chemically defined medium (CDM) (15.van de Rijn I. Kessler R.E. Infect. Immun. 1980; 27: 444-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a control or in CDM with 5 mm sodium fluoride (NaF, “Suprapure”; E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at 37 °C for 16 h. NaF was separately filter-sterilized before adding into the sterile medium. Bacteria were harvested after overnight culture by centrifugation at 6000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Both cellular proteins and proteins in the extracellular supernatant were extracted. For the cellular components, the bacteria were washed twice with ice-cold 18-megohm water and then sonicated at level 4 with 60% duty cycle (High Intensity Ultrasonic Cell Disrupter, Sonics & Materials Inc, Danbury, CT) on ice until more than 80% of cells were broken. The protein mixture was centrifuged at 6000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved. The sample was lyophilized and resuspended in a sample buffer containing 40 mm Tris, 7.92 m urea, 0.06% SDS, 1.76% ampholytes, 120 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 3.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium azide. For the extracellular proteins, the culture supernatant was precipitated overnight by ammonium sulfate and centrifuged at 25,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was saved, resuspended in 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and dialyzed two times against 18-megohm water with theM̄ w cut off at 6–8 kDa overnight. The samples were lyophilized and resuspended in the same sample buffer as above. The samples were duplicated and protein concentration was measured by spectrophotometry using Bio-Rad protein microassay based on Bradford's method (16.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). The control and NaF-treated samples were run in parallel with a two-dimensional PAGE running system (Genomic Solutions Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). Immobilized pH gradient strips, non-linear pH 3–10, 18 cm long (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Fairfield, NJ) were rehydrated overnight with 100 μg of proteins in rehydration buffer containing 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.01 m DTT, 2% ampholytes, and bromphenol blue and focused with maximal 5000 V and 80 μA for 24 h at 17 °C to reach 100,000 V.h. After completion of focusing the samples were equilibrated with buffer containing 6m urea, 130 mm DTT, 30% glycerol, 112 mm Tris base, 4% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue and acetic acid and then with buffer containing 6 m urea, 135 mm iodoacetamide, 30% glycerol, 112 mm Tris base, 4% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and acetic acid. The strips were loaded onto pre-cast 10% homogeneous, 20- × 20-cm slab gels (Genomic Solutions Inc.). Upper running buffer contained with 0.2 m Tris base, 0.2m Tricine, and 0.4% SDS and lower running buffer was 0.625m Tris acetate. The system was run with maximal 500 V and 20,000 milliwatts per gel. The gel slabs were fixed in 10% methanol and 7% acetic acid for 30 min. The fixed solution was removed and 500 ml of SYPRO ruby gel stain (Bio-Rad Laboratory, Hercules, CA) was add to each gel and incubated on gently continuous rocker at room temperature for 18 h. A high resolution 12-bit camera with UV light box system (Genomic Solutions Inc.) was used to visualize the protein spots. Five different exposure time points (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 s) were set to scan the gels. The images were inverted before analysis with two-dimensional analysis software. Investigator HT analyzer (Genomic Solutions Inc.) software was used for matching and analysis of the protein spot expression on gels. A reference gel was created by combining all of the spots from different gels into one image. The average mode of background subtraction was used for normalization of intensity volume of each spot and for compatibility of the intensity between each gel. The reference gel was then used for determination of existence and difference of protein expression between each group. The intensity less than a 0.5-fold or greater than 2-fold of the control was considered significantly changed. Samples were prepared using a modification of the technique described by Jensen (17.Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar). The protein spots were excised with a clean scalpel into 1-mm cubes. The gel pieces were transferred to clean 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and wash with 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) at room temperature for 15 min. Acetonitrile was added to the gel pieces and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The solvent was removed, and the gel pieces were dried in laminar flow hood. The gel pieces were rehydrated with 20 μl of 20 mm DTT in 0.1 mNH4HCO3 and incubated at 56 °C for 45 min to reduce the protein. The tubes were chilled at room temperature, and the DTT solution was removed and replaced with 20 μl of 55 mmiodoacetamide in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The iodoacetamide was removed and replaced with 0.2 ml of 50 mmNH4HCO3 and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Acetonitrile (0.2 ml) was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The solvent was removed, and the gel pieces were dried in laminar flow hood. The gel pieces were rehydrated with 20 ng/μl modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 with the minimal volume to cover the gel pieces. The gel pieces were chopped into four to five smaller pieces and incubated at 37 °C overnight in shaking incubator to enhance microcirculation of the digestive solution and to prevent drops formation under the cover of microcentrifuge tubes. Nitrocellulose solution was made by dissolving a nitrocellulose membrane in 1:1 acetone/isopropanol solvent. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (α-CN) was washed with 50 μl of acetone, and acetone phase was discarded. The α-CN was dissolved in acetone to a concentration of 10 mg/ml, and the nitrocellulose and α-CN solutions were mixed to 1:4 ratio, and 1 μl of this mixture was deposited onto the 96-well MALDI target plate. The samples were prepared for addition to the plate by mixing 2 μl of sample with 2 μl of 10 mg/ml α-CN solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 1:1 H2O/acetonitrile. The sample mixtures (1 μl) were loaded onto each thin film. After the sample mixtures were dried, 1.5 μl of 2% formic acid was added to each spot. The formic solution was removed by gentle blotting. This washing step was performed twice. The samples were then dried at room temperature. Fragment size was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Mass spectral data were obtained using a Micromass Tof-Spec 2E instrument equipped with a 337-nm N2 laser at 20–35% power in the positive ion reflectron mode. Spectral data were obtained by averaging 10 spectra each of which was the composite of 10 laser firings. The mass axis was calibrated using known peaks from tryptic autolysis. Peptide mass fingerprinting was used for protein identification from tryptic fragment sizes by using the MASCOT search engine (www.matrixscience.com) based on the entire NCBInr protein data base using the assumption that peptides are monoisotopic, oxidized at methionine residues and carbamidomethylated at cysteine residues. Up to one missed trypsin cleavage was allowed, although most matches did not contain any missed cleavages. Mass tolerance of 150 ppm was the window of error to be allowed for matching the peptide mass values. Probability-based MOWSE scores were estimated by comparison of search results against estimated random match population and were reported as −10*log10(P), where P is the absolute probability. Scores greater than 71 were considered significant (p < 0.05). The pattern of protein separation by two-dimensional PAGE was consistent and essentially identical in different culture samples of S. pyogenes. A total of 183 cellular protein spots were visualized. The protein spots were excised and underwent in-gel tryptic digestion. Peptide masses were obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Shown in Fig. 1 is a typical mass spectra of a protein, the 60-kDa chaperone that was identified using the MASCOT search engine to query the NCBI protein data base (Fig. 2). All protein identifications were in the expected size range based on position in the gel. Fifty-five unique proteins were identified from 66 spots present on gels. (Fig. 3 A, Table I).Figure 2Peptide mass fingerprinting. Peptide mass fingerprinting of the observed masses in Fig. 1 was performed using the MASCOT search engine. Scores more than 71 were considered statistically significant for matching (p < 0.05). Observed masses (32 of total 35 masses) were matched to the theoretical masses of 60 kDa heat shock protein (GroEL) with less than 150-ppm window of error and mostly 0 missed cleavage. The matched masses were then converted to amino acid sequences along variable residue sites and covered 68% of the GroEL sequences. * An oxidation site on methionine that caused mass shift.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Proteome maps for S. pyogenesand alterations by fluoride.

Open table in a new tab Expression of 38 protein forms was decreased after exposure to fluoride and six protein forms had increased expression after fluoride exposure (Fig. 3 B, Table I). General stress protein 24, elongation factors G and P, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, putative 6-phosphofructokinase, putative orotidine-5′-decarboxylase PyrF, and putative xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase were absent after fluoride exposure. Deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase was expressed only after fluoride exposure. Table III summarizes the differential expression of proteins that were classified based on their functional categories as modified from the functional categories of M1S. pyogenes genome (18.Ferretti J.J.

Some of the proteins have multiple functions in bacteria, for example GAPDH is necessary for glycolysis, cell wall adhesion, and signal transduction. As shown in Table III, marked decreases in expression were seen in protein chaperones, general stress protein, regulators of DNA and RNA synthesis, glycolytic and other metabolic enzymes, and proteins essential to translation.Table IIISummary of the altered proteins after fluoride exposureFunctional categoriesProteinSpot no.Regulation by NaFHeat-shock protein/chaperone60-kDa chaperone (GroEL)2DownHeat-shock protein 70 (dnaK)6, 7DownHeat-shock protein GrpE27DownOther stress proteinsSuperoxide dismutase (SOD)3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.64DownAlkyl hydroperoxidase3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.38DownGeneral stress protein 249DisappearedDNA and RNA synthesisPutative GMP synthase41DownOrotate phosphoribosyl transferase46DownOrotidine-5′-decarboxylase PyrF47, 48DownChain A, Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase5DownPyrimidine regulatory protein54DownXanthine phosphoribosyltransferase59DisappearedDeoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase13Newly expressedEnergy production and glycolytic pathwayFructose-bisphosphate aldolase21, 24DisappearedGAPDH3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.26DownNADP-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.45Down6-Phosphofructokinase35Disappeared2-Dehydropantoate 2-reductase34DownPyruvate kinase54DownTransketolase57DownTranscription regulatorPutative TetR-family transcriptional regulator56DownRopA61DownSigmaB regulating protein RsbU62UpTranslation, ribosomal structure, and biosynthesis50 S ribosomal protein L101DownElongation factor G15DisappearedElongation factor P16DisappearedElongation factor TU18, 19DownPolypeptide deformylase51DownMembrane proton transportPutative transport system permease58DownCalcium-binding protein3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.4UpSignal transductionGlyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.26DownNADP-dependent GAPDH3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.45DownPhosphotransacetylase50DownProtein-tyrosine phosphatase32UpVirulence factor and cell wall adhesionTetravalent M protein73DisappearedM5 protein74DisappearedCysteine protease SpeB69–72UpdTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose-3,5-epimerase3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.40DownSuperoxide dismutase3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.64DownAlkyl hydroperoxidase3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.38DownCalcium-binding protein3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.4UpGAPDH3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.26DownCell wall synthesisdTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose-3,5-epimerase3-aProteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria.40DownUnknownYomF66DownSubtylisin Dy63Up3-a Proteins that have multiple functions in the bacteria. Open table in a new tab A total of 62 protein spots were visualized and 8 spots representing 5 unique proteins were identified in culture supernatants (Fig. 3 C, Table II). The identified proteins in culture supernatants were not observed in cellular components and have been previously described as extracellular proteins in streptococcal culture supernatants (19.Lei B. Mackie S. Lukomski S. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6807-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20.Hytonen J. Haataja S. Gerlach D. Podbielski A. Finne J. Mol.

Proteins present in culture supernatants were presumably from surface-expressed proteins and were released or shed during normal and stress conditions. Cysteine protease SpeB, also known as pyrogenic exotoxin B, was expressed as multiple forms on the two-dimensional PAGE that reflect the previously described cleavage of this protein (22.Boyle M.D.P. Romer T.G. Meeker A.K. Sledjeski D.D. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2001; 46: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).

Notably, the expression of both M virulence forms identified as tetravalent M and M5 proteins were absent after fluoride exposure (Fig. 3 D, Table II). We have constructed an initial proteome map for both cellular and supernatant protein expression of S. pyogenes. This map permits consistent identification of proteins as the coordinates of the protein spots are highly reproducible on high resolution two-dimensional PAGE gels. We identified 60 unique cellular and culture supernatant proteins by peptide mass fingerprinting that were expressed in 74 forms on two-dimensional PAGE. Fluoride exposure markedly altered both intracellular protein expression and the content of proteins in the culture supernatant, without affecting cell viability. The altered proteins were summarized in Table III, and their functions were classified as modified from the function categories of M1 S. pyogenes genome (18.Ferretti J.J. McShan W.M. Ajdic D. Savic D.J. Savic G. Lyon K. Primeaux C. Sezate S. Suvorov A.N. Kenton S. Lai H.S. Lin S.P. Qian Y. Jia H.G. Najar F.Z. Ren Q. Zhu H. Song L. White J. Yuan X. Clifton S.W. Roe B.A. McLaughlin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4658-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Fluoride caused decreased expression of several proteins that have been implicated in S. pyogenes virulence. Fluoride caused decreased expression in culture supernatants of the well-characterized M Protein virulence factors. Decreased release of M protein into the culture supernatant presumably reflects decreased surface expression, because M protein is primarily confined to the bacterial membrane and intracellular expression of M protein was unchanged. M protein has been shown to promote S. pyogenes virulence by inhibiting phagocytosis and increasing adherence to host tissues. GAPDH expression was also decreased by fluoride. GAPDH expressed on the S. pyogenes cell surface acts as a virulence factor by binding fibronectin and stimulating signal transduction in host cells (23.Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24.Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 25.Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1633-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Purified GAPDH stimulated serine and tyrosine kinase activity in host cells that was required for uptake of bacteria. Considered together, fluoride-induced decreases in M protein and GAPDH could result in decreased adherence to and penetration of the host epithelial barrier. Paradoxically, we observed increased release into culture supernatant of the major streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB. The potential role of SpeB as a virulence factor has been studied extensively. SpeB activates interleukin-1β, kininogen, and matrix metalloproteinases, presumably promoting inflammation and tissue destruction (26.Kapur V. Majesky M.W. Li L.L. Black R.A. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7676-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 27.Shanley T.P. Schrier D. Kapur V. Kehoe M. Musser J.M. Ward P.A. Infect.

Based on these findings, an increase in the release of SpeB would presumably promote virulence. However, studies that addressed the clinical relevance of SpeB as a virulence factor in animal models of infection have yielded conflicting results. Talkington et al. (29.Talkington D.F. Schwartz B. Black C.M. Todd J.K. Elliott J. Breiman R.F. Facklam R.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3369-3374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed no relation between SpeB expression and invasiveS. pyogenes infection. Chaussee et al.(30.Chaussee M.S. Liu J. Stevens D.L. Ferretti J.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 173: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) determined SpeB production in 117 S. pyogenes clinical isolates and observed no correlation with the severity of disease. Kansal et al. (31.Kansal R.G. McGeer A. Low D.E. Norrby-Teglund A. Kotb M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6362-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) observed an inverse relationship between disease severity and SpeB expression in S. pyogenes isolates from patients with invasive Group A infections. Finally, SpeBactivity is governed, in part, by the protein RopA. RopA contributes to the post-translational processing of SpeB that establishes an active conformation after secretion (32.Lyon W.R. Gibson C.M. Caparon M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6263-6275Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Fluoride caused a marked decrease in the expression of RopA. Considered together, these data suggest that, although SpeB may function as a virulence factor, changes in the absolute levels of SpeB expression may be less relevant to virulence. Fluoride exposure did not directly affect cell viability but did alter the expression of proteins essential to survival and the response to stress. S. pyogenes exposed to fluoride expressed lower levels of GroEL and DnaK chaperone proteins, as well as general stress protein 24. Fluoride-treated S. pyogenes also had markedly decreased expression of proteins required for scavenging oxygen radicals. However, fluoride exposure caused increased expression of one protein that regulates the response to stress, RsbU. We observed a 2-fold increase in a protein with significant homology to RsbU. RsbU regulates the SigmaB protein that has been well characterized in the response of Bacillus subtilis to stress induced by heat, ethanol, salt, and energy starvation. Activation of the SigmaB regulon results in the induction of general stress proteins and a variety of other proteins essential to the stress response. The SigmaB regulon has been well-characterized in many bacteria, but is incompletely understood in Streptococcus (33.Jayaraman G.C. Penders J.E. Burne R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34.Wendrich T.M. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We postulate that increased expression of RsbU represents an attempt by S. pyogenes to activate the SigmaB stress response to cope with the effects of fluoride. Several examples are present in the literature of the application of proteomic analysis to the study of Streptococcus species (19.Lei B. Mackie S. Lukomski S. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6807-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 35.Perrin C. Gonzalez-Marquez H. Gaillard J.L. Bracquart P. Guimont C. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36.Wilkins J.C. Homer K.A. Beighton D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3396-3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). None of these studies examined the effect of fluoride onS. pyogenes and cannot be used to confirm our findings. Many previous studies have determined that fluoride inhibits the function of several proteins, including catalase, superoxide dismutase, and elongation factor G (37.Meier B. Scherk C. Schmidt M. Parak F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 38.Mesters J.R. Martien D.G. Kraal B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These studies did not examine the effect of fluoride on the amount expressed of these proteins. Our data indicate that effect of fluoride on the function of many proteins may result from decreased expression as well as the previously observed inhibition of protein function. Our proteomic analysis also suggests a new hypothesis to test regarding the effect of fluoride on S. pyogenes. We observed that fluoride altered the expression of proteins essential to the non-suppurative complications of S. pyogenes infection, including rheumatic fever and APSGN. We observed decreased expression of GAPDH, GroEL, and DnaK proteins previously implicated in the pathogenesis of ASPGN and rheumatic fever (39.Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar, 40.Nordstrand A. Norgren M. Holm S.E. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 31: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41.Fontan P.A. Pancholi V. Nociari M.M. Fischetti V.A. J. Infect.

We further observed a decrease in the amount of M protein released into the supernatant by fluoride-treated bacteria. M protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both rheumatic fever and ASPGN. One putative mechanism for M protein's role in these disorders is presumably the cross-reaction of anti-M protein antibodies with host myosin proteins (43.Quinn A. Kosanke S. Fischetti V.A. Factor S.M. Cunningham M.W. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4072-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 44.Quinn A. Ward K. Fischetti V.A. Hemric M. Cunningham M.W. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4418-4424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several factors may have contributed to the decreased incidence of rheumatic fever and APSGN in industrialized countries, including the introduction of antibiotics, aggressive treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, and improved public health measures. However, the decline in rheumatic fever and ASPGN also began at the time that fluoridation of water supplies was introduced (45.Ripa L.W. J. Public Health Dent. 1993; 53: 17-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 46.Burt B.A. Br. Dent. J. 1995; 178: 49-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 47.Easley M.W. Br. Dent. J. 1995; 178: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our data suggest the hypothesis fluoridation of water may have influenced the decline in non-suppurative S. pyogenes complications. In summary, we have used proteomic analysis to construct a reference proteome map for S. pyogenes. This map can then be used to study a large number of proteins simultaneously from any interventions. Several cellular and extracellular proteins were altered by fluoride. We postulate that fluoride may affect defense mechanisms, virulence, and immunogenicity of the streptococci and may aid to a reduction of poststreptococcal sequelae. Further studies are needed to explore these complex mechanisms of fluoride on S. pyogenes."

Arabidopsis contains six E2F homologs, of which three are proteins that exhibit an overall similarity to animal E2Fs and interact with DPa and DPb to stimulate DNA binding. Here we describe the other three E2F-like proteins fromArabidopsis, E2L1–3, which have two copies of a domain with a limited similarity only to the DNA binding domain of E2F. Unlike known E2Fs, the three E2L proteins failed to interact with DPa and DPb and could efficiently bind E2F sites in a monomeric form through the dual-type domain. Transfection assays revealed that E2Ls repress the transcription of reporter genes under the control of E2F-regulated promoters, indicating that E2Ls function to antagonize transactivation mediated by E2F·DP. When fused to green fluorescence protein, E2L1 and E2L3 were predominantly localized to the nucleus whereas E2L2 was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Because the transcripts of E2Ls were abundant in meristematic rather than fully differentiated tissues, E2Ls may balance the activities of E2F·DP and play a role in restraining cell proliferation.

On the other hand, a subgroup composed of E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 greatly contributes to cell cycle progression to S phase, whereas the other subgroup members E2F-4 and E2F-5 are mainly involved in a G1 (G0) arrest mediated by interaction with p130 (1.Dyson N.

RNR and PCNA promoters from tobacco and rice contain E2F sites that indeed bind E2F and control the transcription (28.Chaboute M.E. Clement B. Sekine M. Philipps G. Chaubet-Gigot N.

A number of cDNAs encoding E2F or DP homologs have been isolated and characterized in plants (31.Ramı́rez-Parra E. Xie Q. Boniotti M.B. Gutierrez C.

The plant E2Fs share the same set of conserved domains (the DNA binding domain, dimerization domain, marked box and Rb-binding domain) as the animal E2F proteins, but they have no distinguishable similarity with the individual animal proteins, although they slightly resemble E2F-4, E2F-5, or E2F-6 (30.Kosugi S.

Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Like the E2F family from animals, the plant E2F proteins can bind to the consensus binding sites of the animal E2F, and their DNA binding activities can be stimulated by the plant DP proteins and human DP-1 (30.Kosugi S.

It has been also shown that they can bind human Rb or Rb-like proteins from plants through the C-terminal region (31.Ramı́rez-Parra E. Xie Q. Boniotti M.B. Gutierrez C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3527-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32.Sekine M. Ito M. Uemukai K. Maeda Y. Nakagami H. Shinmyo A.

Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Rice and Arabidopsis E2Fs have been shown to contain activation domains in the C-terminal regions and transactivate an E2F-reporter gene in plant cells (30.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 37.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, three E2F (AtE2F1–3) and two DP (DPa and DPb) proteins have been isolated to date. The DNA binding activities of AtE2F1–3 are equally stimulated by the two DP proteins (35.Magyar Z. Atanassova A. De Veylder L. Rombauts S. Inzé D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36.de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas AtE2F1 and AtE2F3 can transactivate an E2F-reporter gene by the coexpression of DPa but not DPb (37.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This transactivation is primarily due to nuclear localization mediated by specific interaction with the DPa protein, whereas the Arabidopsis E2F and DP proteins are not imported to the nucleus by themselves (37.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The interaction-dependent nuclear import is mediated by both an N-terminal conserved sequence and a conserved nuclear export signal-like sequence present in the dimerization domain of AtE2Fs (37.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This contrasts to the regulation of the mammalian E2F family, in which only the E2F-4/5 subfamily exhibits a regulated nuclear import mediated by interaction with DP-2, p107 or p130 (38.de la Luna S. Burden M.J. Lee C.W. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Magae J. Wu C.L. Illenye S. Harlow E. Heintz N.H. J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 7268-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AtE2F2 has no transactivation potential, because it lacks an intrinsic transactivation domain (36.de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for AtE2F2 in transcriptional repression, like E2F-6 from mammals. Here we describe that Arabidopsis expresses three more E2F-like proteins that contain two separate domains exhibiting a similarity limited to the DNA binding domain of E2F. Unlike known E2Fs, these E2F-like proteins efficiently bind E2F sites in the monomeric form but not as a heterodimer with DP proteins and repress E2F-regulated promoters. Additionally, these proteins have an ability to localize to the nucleus, and all of their mRNAs are expressed mainly in meristematic tissues. These findings suggest that plants regulate the cell cycle through both the E2F·DP-Rb pathway and the E2L repressors unique to plants. Suspension-cultured tobacco cells were established from calli of Nicotiana tobacum cv. Sumsun NN and maintained as described previously (30.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Arabidopsisplants (A. thaliana ecotype Columbia) were grown in pots in growth chambers at 20 °C under 16 h of illumination per day. The E2Ls cDNAs were cloned by RT-PCR amplification with mRNA isolated from young wholeArabidopsis plants, based on open reading frames predicted from Arabidopsis genomic sequences. The AtE2F2 (GenBank™ accession numbers AF242581/AB050114), AtE2F3 (AJ294534/AF242582), DPa (AJ294531), and DPb (AJ294532) cDNAs were isolated by RT-PCR based on the cDNA sequences in the data bases. The N-terminal primers were designed to containSpeI/NcoI sites for E2L1 and BamHI sites for E2L2 and E2L3, and all the C-terminal primers containedXhoI sites at their 5′-ends. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the pBluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequence integrity of all the amplified fragments was confirmed by sequencing with ABI DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA fragments excised from the subcloned plasmids were inserted into the pET-32a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and used for production of recombinant proteins. Deletion mutants of E2L1, E2L1ΔC, E2LDB1, and E2LDB2, were generated by insertion of the following fragments into the pET-32a or -32c vector; an NcoI-HindIII fragment from the E2L1 cDNA (for AL1ΔC), and NcoI-XhoI fragments from PCR products amplified with the M13 forward vector primer and 5′-GGACTCAACTCGAGTGAATTCTCTGGGAGATGGTGAG (for E2LDB1), and 5′-GGACTCAACCATGGGATCCGGAATGAAAGAGAAGTTTGC and the M13 reverse vector primer (for E2LDB2). For AF3DB, a fragment amplified by PCR with the AtE2F3 cDNA and a primer set (5′-GGACTCAACCATGGAATTCTGTCGTTATGACAGTTCTTTAG-3′ and 5′-GGACTCAACTCGAGTGGATCCTACGTCAGCATCCTCATC-3′), was inserted into the pET-32a vector. For the yeast two-hybrid assays, the E2L1, AtE2F2, AtE2F3, DPa, and DPb cDNAs were inserted into the pGBKT7 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to generate bait constructs, pGB-E2L1, -AF2, -AF3, -DPa, and-DPb. The E2L1 and AtE2F3 cDNAs were inserted into the pAD-GAL4–2.1 vector (Stratagene) to generate prey constructs pAD-E2L1 and pAD-AF3. For plant expression constructs, the E2Ls, AtE2F3, and DPa cDNAs were inserted into the pCEP5 vector (43.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) to generate p35S-E2L1, -E2L2 -E2L3, -AF3, and -DPa. The tobacco and rice PCNA promoter reporters,NtPCNA-GUS (30.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), OsPCNA-GUS, andOsPCNAΔ-GUS, in which the rice constructs were generated by changing the binary vector of PCB2K and PCBΔ2 (44.Kosugi S. Suzuka I. Ohashi Y. Murakami T. Arai Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to the pUC19 vector, were used for transfection assays. To generate expression constructs for proteins fused with green fluorescence protein (GFP), the E2Ls cDNA fragments and the GUS coding sequence were inserted into the SpeI and XhoI sites of pCEP-GFP, a slightly modified version (37.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) of the 35S-sGFP vector (45.Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Yasuo Niwa. The production and purification of recombinant thioredoxin (Trx) fusion proteins with E2Ls were performed as described previously (43.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The conditions for EMSAs were as described previously (30.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Yeast manipulations, including culture, transformation, and the yeast two-hybrid assay with the strain SFY526 were performed as described previously (46.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1607-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Proteins were synthesized by coupled transcription-translation with a TnT wheat germ extract kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and T7 RNA polymerase using pGB-E2L1, -AF2, -AF3, -DPa, and -DPb. Reactions were performed with 1 μg of total plasmid DNA in 25 μl of solution. Transfection of plasmid DNA into the cultured tobacco cells by microprojectile bombardment was performed as described (37.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Bombarded samples were cultured at 28 °C for 16–17 h in the dark and used for luciferase and GUS assays as described (34.Ramı́rez-Parra E. Gutierrez C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All GUS values were normalized using luciferase activities. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and independently performed at least two times. Transfection of the GFP constructs into the suspension-cultured tobacco cells was conducted by microprojectile bombardment with 0.5 mg of gold particles coated with a total of 1 μg of plasmid, as described above. GFP expression in the cells was observed 17–20 h after the transfection using an epifluorescence microscope, model AX70 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), with a MWIA/GFP filter cube (excitation filter, 460–490 nm; barrier filter, 510–550 nm). Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol procedure, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized with 5 μg of total RNA, 0.5 μg of an oligo dT primer, and ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). RT-PCR was performed using 0.5–2.0 μl of a 1:30 dilution of the cDNA products and the primer set used for isolation of the E2L cDNAs. For analyses ofArabidopsis 18 S rRNA expression, we used the primers 5′-ACAATCTAAATCCCTTAACGAGGATC-3′ and 5′-ACTAGGACGGTATCTGATCGTCTTC-3′. All the primers were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. PCR products were amplified for 32 cycles for E2L1, 36 cycles for E2L2 and E2L3, and 16 cycles for 18 S rRNA and separated by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and autoradiographed using intensifying screens. TheArabidopsis genome encodes three E2F proteins that exhibit an overall similarity to animal E2F proteins (36.de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Surveying theArabidopsis genome sequence has revealed that the genome contains more three E2F-like genes exhibiting a limited similarity to E2F. We isolated the cDNA encoding the three E2F-like proteins, designated E2L1, E2L2, and E2L3, by RT-PCR based on the open reading frames predicted from the genome sequence. The E2L1–3 cDNAs encoded proteins with 359, 354, and 403 amino acids, respectively, which exhibited 57, 38, and 42% amino acid identity between E2L1/E2L2, E2L1/E2L3, and E2L2/E2L3, respectively. Strikingly homologous regions among these proteins, DB1 and DB2, are homologous to the DNA binding domain of animal and plant E2Fs (Fig. 1). The DB1 and DB2 domains of E2L1 share 36 and 31% identical (60 and 46% similar) amino acids, respectively, with the DNA binding domain of human E2F-1. No other region of the E2Ls exhibited similarity to conserved domains of E2F, including the dimerization domain, marked box, and Rb binding domain. The similarity of E2Ls to the DNA binding domain of E2F suggests the ability of E2Ls to bind DNA. We analyzed the DNA binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using recombinant thioredoxin (Trx) proteins fused with E2Ls and double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing E2F sites. All the E2L fusion proteins bound to a te2f-1 probe, which contains an E2F site present in the tobacco PCNA promoter (30.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but not to an mte2f-1 probe, a mutant of te2f-1 (Fig. 2). A te2f-α probe, which contains another class of E2F-binding site conserved among potential E2F-regulated genes in Arabidopsis as well as the te2f-1 site (30.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), also bound these proteins with a slightly decreased activity. The observed DNA binding specificity of E2Ls was the same as that of rice E2F proteins (OsE2F1 and OsE2F2) and an OsE2F1·DP complex (30.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, E2Ls appeared to be efficient in binding DNA at low concentrations, suggesting no requirement of other factors for the activity. To determine the role of the conserved domains of E2Ls in DNA binding, we tested the ability of E2L1 to bind DNA by EMSA using recombinant Trx-E2L1 proteins with a deletion (Fig. 3 A). E2L1ΔC, an E2L1 mutant with a deletion of the C-terminal 127 amino acid residues, retained the ability to bind the te2f-1 probe with no apparent loss of activity (Fig. 3 B). Incidentally, the mobilities of these shifted bands were similar partly due to a C-terminally fused portion derived from the vector sequence in the pET-E2LΔC construct. When either the DB2 or DB1 domain was deleted from E2L1 (E2L1DB1 or E2L1DB2), a complete loss of the activity was observed. Similarly, the DNA binding domain from AtE2F3 (AF3DB), an Arabidopsis E2F protein, had no ability to bind the DNA probe. The Trx-E2L1DB1, -E2L1DB2, and -AF3DB proteins did not bind to the probe even at a higher concentration (data not shown). These results indicate that E2L1 requires both DB1 and DB2 to bind the E2F site. E2F proteins interact with DP proteins to bind DNA whereas E2Ls appear to efficiently bind DNA by themselves. To determine whether E2Ls interact with DP proteins and the DNA binding activity is affected by the interaction, we first measured the activity of E2L1 for the interaction with Arabidopsis DP proteins, DPa and DPb, by the yeast two-hybrid assay. When E2L1 was used as prey, it did not activate an LacZ reporter gene by the coexpression of DPa and DPb used as bait, indicating that E2L1 interacts with neither DPa nor DPb (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, the E2L1 constructs as prey and bait did not interact with each other, indicating no ability to form a homodimer. In contrast, AtE2F3 used as prey had the ability to interact with both DPa and DPb, as demonstrated by high levels of β-galactosidase activity. But AtE2F3 as prey did not interact with E2L1 used as bait. Similarly, when AtE2F1 and AtE2F2 were used as prey, no β-galactosidase activity was observed for the interaction with E2L1 used as bait (data not shown), indicating that E2L1 also can not interact with AtE2Fs. By EMSA with in vitro translation products of E2L1 andArabidopsis E2Fs and DPs, we next examined a possible change in the DNA binding activity of E2L1. An in vitro translation product of E2L1 efficiently bound to the te2f-1 probe whereas no other related proteins (AtE2F2, AtE2F3, DPa, and DPb) exhibited activity to bind the probe (Fig. 4 B). Cotranslation products of E2L1 exhibited neither changes in DNA binding activity for E2L1 nor any newly shifted bands other than the original band of E2L1. Although AtE2F3 formed a complex with DPa to bind the probe, as shown by a low mobility shift band in the last lane, this complex did not appear to cause a significant change in the high mobility band of E2L1. It is noted that the calculated molecular mass of the AtE2F3·DPa complex (∼86 kDa) roughly corresponds to a homodimeric form of E2L1 (82 kDa: 2 times 41 kDa), indicating that the high mobility band of the E2L1·DNA complex is derived from the monomeric E2L1 bound to DNA but not the dimeric protein. These results indicate that E2L1 does not interact with DP and E2F proteins and bind to DNA in a monomeric form. To examine the transcriptional regulatory function of E2Ls, we carried out transfection assays by microprojectile bombardment of suspension-cultured tobacco cells. Reporter constructs containing the bacterial β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fused with the tobacco (NtPCNA) or rice PCNA promoter (OsPCNA), which contain functional E2F sites (30.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), exhibited a moderate GUS expression in transfected tobacco cells (Fig. 5 A). When either expression construct containing the E2L1, E2L2, or E2L3 cDNA under the control of the CaMV35S promoter was transfected with the reporter gene, the expression of the reporter genes, especially from the rice promoter, was substantially decreased, although E2L2 did not affect the tobacco promoter (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the 35S promoter or its truncated core promoter was not affected by the expression of E2Ls (data not shown). A rice PCNA promoter truncated to −263 (OsPCNAΔ), which retained the E2F site, was also repressed to an extent comparable to the full-length promoter by the E2L1 expression. These results indicate that the repression is mediated by the E2F site. These reporter constructs were transactivated by coexpression of AtE2F1 and DPa (Fig. 5 B). Expression of either E2L protein antagonized the transactivation. E2L1 appeared to have the greatest ability to repress the promoter activated by exogenously expressed E2F·DP as well as by endogenous factors. These results indicate that the E2L proteins act as repressors of E2F-regulated promoters probably by competing for E2F sites. We then examined the subcellular localization of E2Ls using proteins fused with the green fluorescence protein (GFP). When the fusion proteins (GFP-E2L1, -E2L2, and -E2L3) were expressed in cultured tobacco cells, GFP fluorescence was observed mainly in the nucleus, although GFP-E2L2 was detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 6). The incomplete nuclear localization correlate with a less effective repression of the PCNA promoters compared with E2L1 and -3, as shown in Fig. 5. In contrast, GFP fused with the bacterial β-glucuronidase (GUS), which is a cytoplasmic protein in plant cells, was detected mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6 D). These results suggest that the E2L proteins are nuclear and carry an intrinsic nuclear localization signal. Consistently, there is a potential bipartite nuclear localization signal (KRX 11KRXK) in the C-terminal region, which is conserved in all the E2L proteins. Finally, we performed RT-PCR analysis to examine the cell specificity of the accumulation of E2L transcripts (Fig. 7). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized with total RNA extracted from mature leaves at a stage before flower initiation (ML), young immature leaves containing leaf primordia and meristems (YL), young developing stalks located under immature inflorescence (YS), mature grown stalks (MS), young developing flower buds (YF), and mature open flowers (MF). cDNA synthesis was assessed by RT-PCR with primers specific for the 18 S rRNA gene. RT-PCR analysis using primer sets specific for the E2L cDNAs showed that the E2L1 transcript was abundant in young developing organs and tissues such as the meristematic leaves, young stalks, and immature flower buds, whereas it was less common in mature organs such as adult leaves and stalks, as shown by the amplified fragments (Fig. 7). Similar patterns were observed for the accumulation of the E2L2 and E2L3 transcripts, indicating that the three E2L transcripts are preferentially expressed in growing tissues. Unlike the E2L1 transcript, however, the E2L2 and E2L3 transcripts were less expressed at the developing stages in stalk and abundant at both stages of flower development, indicating that both the E2L2 andE2L3 genes are regulated in a manner different from theE2L1 gene. The three E2L proteins found in Arabidopsiscontain two copies of a domain that resembles the DNA binding domain of plant and animal E2Fs and can effectively bind to E2F sites as a monomer. General E2F proteins, including AtE2F1–3 form a complex with DP proteins to stimulate the binding of DNA. E2F itself also can bind DNA as a homodimer at high concentrations. For recombinant rice E2F proteins, OsE2F1 and -2, a concentration of 10 ng/ml is required for the binding to DNA whereas heterodimer complexes of OsE2F1 or DPs can effectively bind DNA at lower concentrations (30.Kosugi S.

Because DP proteins also contain a region homologous to the DNA binding domain of E2F, a DP homodimer seems to bind E2F sites through this homologous domain, as well as a E2F homodimer and E2F·DP heterodimer. It is most likely that the repeat of the DNA binding domain-like region of E2Ls mimics two DNA binding domains in the homodimer or heterodimer of E2F and DP and constitutes a DNA binding domain. This is supported by the observation that deletion of either of the two homologous regions of E2L1 resulted in a complete loss of the ability to bind DNA. This novel DNA binding domain allows E2Ls to effectively bind DNA even at a low concentration. Because the strong DNA binding activity of the E2F·DP heterodimer relative to that of each homodimer is due to a greater affinity for heteromeric interaction, the DNA binding domain of E2Ls could be in the form of a covalently linked homodimer or heterodimer of E2F and DP. E2Ls can bind at least two different E2F-binding sites, which are conserved in predicted E2F-regulated promoters inArabidopsis (30.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but not a mutated E2F site. This specificity is similar to that of a heterodimer of OsE2F1 and DPb (30.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although the E2F and DP family has evolved to be conserved between the animal and plant kingdoms, only plants seem to have developed the E2L proteins, because no such species has been found in animals, including human, Drosophila, and nematode. Some transcription factors such as the myb family and zinc finger-type DNA binding proteins contain a single copy or multiple copies of the DNA binding domain, with a different contribution to the binding specificity and strength (47.Jin H. Martin C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 48.Choo Y. Isalan M.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, there are no examples of the same binding specificity between monomeric and dimeric forms. Hence, E2Ls provide a natural example of a novel form of DNA binding in that the DNA binding domain in the monomeric protein mimics its dimeric counterpart. Also, the structural analysis of E2L proteins should help to generate novel DNA binding proteins with an altered binding specificity and affinity via the fusion of different DNA binding domains with an adequate intervening linker, as reported in artificial proteins such as a homeodomain-zinc finger and multimeric zinc finger fusion (49.Pomerantz J.L. Sharp P.A. Pabo C.O. Science. 1995; 267: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 50.Kim J.S. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2812-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). E2Ls repress the activity of tobacco and rice PCNA promoters and antagonize E2F·DP-mediated transactivation. The transcriptional repression function of E2Ls seems to be mediated through competition of the binding to E2F sites. E2F·DP-mediated transactivation of an E2F reporter gene that contains four copies of an E2F site was less effectively antagonized by E2Ls (data not shown). If E2Ls act through active repression, for example, by recruiting a histone deacetylase complex, E2Ls would effectively repress even a promoter containing multiple E2F sites. The observation that the tobacco PCNApromoter containing two E2F sites was less repressed by E2Ls than the rice promoter containing only one functional site further supports this notion. It has been shown that the human E2F-6 and Drosophila dE2F2 proteins function as repressors for E2F-regulated genes (17.Cartwright P. Muller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18.Gaubatz S. Wood J.G. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). AtE2F2, one of three Arabidopsis E2F homologs that exhibit an overall similarity to animal E2Fs, has been shown to have no transactivation function due to the lack of an activation domain (37.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that AtE2F2 is structurally and functionally similar to E2F-6 and dE2F2. E2Ls are thus distinct from these E2F repressors in that they can bind to E2F sites as a monomer and apparently do not require any factors to exert the repression effect despite the fact that they share a similar transcriptional repressing function. The function of E2Ls seems to primarily depend on the regulation of their transcription, because both the DNA binding and nuclear localization are conferred by the autonomous function of the E2Ls, in contrast to AtE2Fs, which are regulated through interaction with DP proteins (37.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The expression patterns of the three E2L transcripts are similar. The transcripts are more abundant in developing young leaves and stems than in fully differentiated mature ones, indicating that these genes are preferentially expressed in dividing cells. In reproductive organs, although relatively many transcripts were detected even in opened flowers, the expression may still be specific to certain dividing cells, because opened flowers bear meristematic regions containing developing ovules in the ovaries. These observations together with a pivotal role for E2F in cell cycle control suggest that E2Ls negatively regulate the cell cycle progression in meristematic tissues. E2Ls may play an important role in fine-tuning gene expression that is activated by E2F·DP and controlling the cell cycle in meristematic tissues, as observed in the antagonistic relationship between the Drosophila E2Fs dE2F1 and dE2F2 (21.Frolov M.V. Huen D.S. Stevaux O. Dimova D. Balczarek-Strang K. Elsdon M. Dyson N.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2146-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although E2Ls may not be involved in the maintenance of cell differentiation, given that few transcripts were found in differentiated tissues, it is of interest to determine whether the potential cell-cycle repression by E2Ls has a role in initiating cell differentiation as well as RBR, Rb-related proteins in plants.

(1999) Glycobiology 9, 833–839), was shown to localize not only to the early secretory pathway but also to the plasma membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. In the plasma membrane, VIP36 exhibited an apical-predominant distribution, the apical/basolateral ratio being ∼2. Like VIP36, plasma membrane glycoproteins recognized by VIP36 were found in the apical and basolateral membranes in the ratio of ∼2 to 1. In addition, secretory glycoproteins recognized by VIP36 were secreted ∼2-fold more efficiently from the apical membrane than from the basolateral membrane. Thus, the apical/basolateral ratio of the transport of VIP36-recognized glycoproteins was correlated with that of VIP36 in MDCK cells. Upon overproduction of VIP36 in MDCK cells, the apical/basolateral ratios of both VIP36 and VIP36-recognized glycoproteins were changed from ∼2 to ∼4, and the secretion of VIP36-recognized glycoproteins was greatly stimulated. In contrast to the overproduction of VIP36, that of a mutant version of VIP36, which has no lectin activity, was of no effect on the distribution of glycoproteins to apical and basolateral membranes and inhibited the secretion of VIP36-recognized glycoproteins. Furthermore, the overproduction of VIP36 greatly stimulated the secretion of a major apical secretory glycoprotein of MDCK cells, clusterin, which was found to carry at least one high mannose-type glycan and to be recognized by VIP36. In contrast to the secretion of clusterin, that of a non-glycosylated apical-secretion protein, galectin-3, was not stimulated through the overproduction of VIP36. These results indicated that VIP36 was involved in the transport and sorting of glycoproteins carrying high mannose-type glycan(s).

Vesicular transport through the Golgi is often accompanied by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation of cargo proteins until they have reached thetrans-Golgi Network. In the trans-Golgi Network, proteins are sorted into vesicles bound for different destinations including the plasma membrane, the endosome/lysosome, and secretory granules. The protein sorting has been one of the most interesting issues in the study of vesicular protein traffic processes, but its molecular mechanisms remain largely unresolved. It has been recently demonstrated that intracellular lectins play important roles in vesicular transport: for example, mannose-6-phosphate receptor (1Dahm N.M. Lobel P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Monsigny M. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The N-terminal luminal domain of ERGIC-53, which includes the carbohydrate-binding domain, has an amino acid sequence similar to that of vesicular integral membrane protein of 36 kDa (VIP36) (9Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1994; 77: 625-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). VIP36 has been originally isolated from MDCK cells as a component of detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-enriched complexes containing apical marker proteins (10Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Etzold T. Simons K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and it has been recently shown to exist in early secretory pathway (11Füllekrug J. Scheiffele P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2813-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that VIP36 has lectin activity recognizing high mannose-type glycans containing over seven mannose residues (12Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These observations have implied that VIP36 is an intracellular lectin involved in the intracellular transport of glycoproteins carrying high mannose-type glycan(s). In this study, to address the function of VIP36, we reexamined the localization of VIP36 and investigated the effect of overproduction of VIP36 and a mutant VIP36 defective in lectin activity on the metabolism and transport of VIP36-recognized glycoproteins in MDCK cells. MDCK cells, strain II, were donated by Dr. M. Tashiro (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan). MDCK cells were maintained in minimum Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, and MDCK/VIP36 and MDCK/mVIP36 cells were cultured in the same medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin) (Invitrogen) in plastic dishes. For polarization, cells were seeded at confluence on polycarbonate filters in 6-well dishes (Transwells, Costar, Inc.) as described previously (13Fukushima K. Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Ideo H. Inazu T. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10579-10584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Under the condition of confluent on a polycarbonate filter, the numbers of cells were 5.0 ± 0.3 × 105 cells corresponding to 0.70 ± 0.04 mg of protein in all cases of MDCK, MDCK/VIP36, and MDCK/mVIP36 cells. Anti-VIP36 polyclonal antibody was prepared by immunization of a rabbit with GST-Vip36 as antigen, and antibody molecules specific for the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion partner were removed by adsorption using a GST protein matrix. Anti-galectin-3 polyclonal antibody was prepared by immunization of a rabbit with recombinant human galectin-3. Anti-clusterin goat polyclonal IgG was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The MDCK cells were immersed in a fixative composed of 1% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% picric acid in 0.01 m PBS for 24 h at 4 °C, washed with PBS, immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C, and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h in some cases. These samples were treated with 1% normal goat serum for 1 h and then with anti-VIP36 antibody (1:100) with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h at 4 °C. After washing, the samples were incubated with purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:500) for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS (pH 8.6) containing 50 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo-octane (Aldrich), an anti-bleaching agent. Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, 0.125% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1% picric acid in 0.01m PBS, pH 7.2, for 24 h at 4 °C. After fixation, the tissues were dehydrated with a graded ethanol series at 0 °C, embedded on Lowicryl K4M, and then cured for 3 days at −35 °C. Ultrathin sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min and 1% normal goat serum for 1 h and then incubated with anti-VIP36 antibody (1:100) with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After rinsing with PBS, the sections were incubated for 1 h with 10-nm colloidal gold-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:200) followed by rinsing with PBS and then distilled water. Finally, the sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with an electron microscope (Hitachi H-800). Cell surface molecules were domain-selectively biotinylated using a membrane-impermeable biotin analog sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) as described by Lisanti et al.(14Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) with slight modifications described below. After washing the cells, which were grown to confluence on polycarbonate filters, three times with ice-cold PBS, either the apical or basolateral surface proteins were biotinylated in PBS containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin for 45 min at 4 °C followed by blocking with 50 mmglycine in PBS. For preparation of domain-selective plasma membrane glycoproteins, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and either the apical or basolateral surface proteins were biotinylated. Then the cells were lysed by incubation on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0) containing protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm, and the supernatant was referred to as the detergent extract. Biotinylated apical or basolateral surface proteins in the supernatants were purified by means of an Immunopure Monomeric Avidin (Pierce) column (1 ml) equilibrated with PBS-0.1% Triton X-100. MDCK cells were lysed by incubation on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) containing protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm, and the supernatant was referred to as the detergent extract. For immunoblot, the proteins were separated on 12 or 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The protein was detected by immunoblot with anti-VIP36 antibody (1:200) or anti-clusterin antibody (1:2000) followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and then visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation, detergent extract or secreted protein in apical medium was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with antibody. Protein A-Sepharose was added, and incubation continued for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the Sepharose beads with lysis buffer or PBS, the precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were detected by using streptavidin-HRP and enhanced chemiluminescence reagent as described above for biotinylated proteins or by autoradiography for metabolic labeled proteins. For preparation of 35S-labeled secretory proteins, the confluent cells cultured on polycarbonate filters were incubated for 30 min in starvation medium lacking methionine and cysteine and then labeled for 1 h with 250 μCi/ml (9.25 MBq/ml) Expre35S35S (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After removing the labeling medium, the cells were washed three times with normal culture medium and incubated for another 2 h in the culture medium. The medium was collected from the apical and basolateral chambers separately and applied to a PD-10 (Amersham Biosciences) column to separate the labeled secretory proteins from free [35S]methionine/cysteine, and concentrated with Centriplus 10 (Amicon Inc.). Expression of the GST fusion protein GST-Vip36 inEscherichia coli and confirmation of its functionality have been described previously (12Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by a two-step polymerase chain reaction method (15Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar) using cDNA of GST-Vip36 as the template and sets of appropriate primers that overlap in the region where the mutation was introduced. The cDNA of mutated GST-Vip36(D131N) was cloned into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences). The full-length cDNA encoding VIP36 was amplified by performing a polymerase chain reaction using cDNA reverse-transcribed from total RNA of MDCK cells as a template and subcloned into pSVOKneo (16Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA encoding mutant VIP36 (D131N) was also prepared by a two-step polymerase chain reaction method using VIP36 cDNA as the template and subcloned into pSVOKneo. 105 MDCK cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes. The next day, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectinTM reagent (Invitrogen). G418-resistant clones were selected in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin). The binding of GST-Vip36 to 35S-labeled proteins has been described previously (12Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding buffer containing GST-Vip36, mutated GST-Vip36(D131N), or GST and35S-detergent extracts (4–5 × 106 dpm) from MDCK cells in a total volume of 100 μl was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the bound proteins were collected and washed using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the radioactivity was counted. The radioactivity obtained in control samples with GST was taken as background. For steady-state determination, cells grown to confluence on polycarbonate filters were labeled with 0.5 ml of minimum Eagle’s medium containing one-tenth of the normal concentration of glucose (100 mg/liter) and 100 μCi (3.7 MBq) of d-[1,6-3H(N)]-glucosamine (35–75 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 24 h. For preparation of clusterin, metabolic-labeled clusterin in medium was immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-clusterin antibody and Protein A-Sepharose. The bound materials were eluted with 0.4n acetic acid, neutralized with pyridine, and dried.N-glycans were released by treatment with 5 units ofN-glycanase (Roche Diagnostic GmbH) at 37 °C for 18 h. Purified [3H]glucosamine-labeled glycoproteins were subjected to hydrazinolysis at 100 °C for 8 h to release3H-glycans from glycoproteins (17Takasaki S. Mizuochi T. Kobata A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). AfterN-acetylation and reduction with NaBH4, neutral oligosaccharides were separated by high voltage paper electrophoresis with pyridine-acetate buffer, pH 5.4 (pyridine:acetic acid:water, 3:1:387) at a potential of 73 V/cm for 60 min and applied to Con A-Sepharose columns (1 ml) equilibrated with PBS. Oligosaccharides were eluted with 5 mm α-methyl-d-glucoside (elution for biantennary glycans) and then 0.2 mα-methyl-d-mannoside (elution for high mannose-type glycans) in PBS (18Kobata A. Yamashita K. Fukuda A. Kobata A. Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1993: 103-125Google Scholar). The fractions of high mannose-type glycans were further fractionated by Bio-Gel P-4 (extra fine, 2 × 100 cm) column chromatography (19Yamashita K. Umetsu K. Suzuki Y. Ohkura K. Biochemistry. 1992; 3: 11647-11650Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The peak fractions from Bio-Gel P-4 chromatography were digested with 1 unit of α-mannosidase (Aspergillus saitoi) (20Yamashita K. Ichishima E. Suzuki K. Kobata A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 4.5) in a total volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 18 h and then fractionated by Bio-Gel P-4 chromatography to determine the high mannose-type glycan structures. We previously determined that VIP36 binds to high mannose-type glycans bearing Man 1→2 residue(s) (12Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To elucidate the functional role of VIP36, we first analyzed the localization of VIP36 histochemically using an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-VIP36 antibody raised against GST-Vip36 (12Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Using immunogold electron microscopy, we confirmed for the first time that endogenous VIP36 is predominantly localized to the early secretory pathway (Fig. 1a). Fig.1a supports the results of Füllekrug et al. (11Füllekrug J. Scheiffele P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2813-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Dahm et al. (21Dahm T. White J. Grill S. Füllekrug J. Stelzer H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1481-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), who recently showed that endogenous VIP36 localizes to the early secretory pathway, cycling between ER-Golgi intermediate structures and the Golgi complex. To examine whether or not endogenous VIP36 is localized not only to the early secretory pathway but also to the plasma membrane, a section with plasma membrane (Fig. 1b) was examined, and several immunogold particles were observed on plasma membrane. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of MDCK cells was performed with or without Triton X-100 treatment. When immunofluorescence staining was performed after Triton X-100 treatment, which enabled the antibody to permeate through plasma membrane, VIP36 seemed to exist broadly in MDCK cells (Fig. 1d). Even without Triton X-100 treatment, the antibody reacted with the preparation, and staining of plasma membranes was observed (Fig. 1e), suggesting that VIP36 existed on the cell surface as shown before (10Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Etzold T. Simons K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, when plasma membrane proteins of intact MDCK cells were biotinylated by a membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-biotin, plasma membrane proteins were isolated using a monomeric avidin-Sepharose by using intact cells. As shown in Fig. 2, the amount of VIP36 biotinylated by using intact cells was estimated to be ∼15% of the total cellular VIP36. These results indicated that endogenous VIP36 was localized not only to the early secretory pathway but also to the plasma membrane of MDCK cells. Next we examined whether VIP36 existed in the apical or basolateral plasma membrane, or in both plasma membrane domains, of polarized MDCK cells. To discriminate between apical and basolateral VIP36, the apical and basolateral membrane proteins of MDCK cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and then selectively biotinylated by the addition of membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-biotin in the apical or basolateral chamber. After extraction with detergent, proteins from apically and basolaterally biotinylated MDCK cells, preparations of which had the same total radioactivity, were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-VIP36 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by detection of biotinylated VIP36 using streptavidin-HRP and chemiluminescence reagent. As shown in Fig. 3 (lanes 1 and 2), bands of VIP36 were found in both preparations from apically and basolaterally biotinylated MDCK cells. When the chemiluminescence of the VIP36 bands was measured using Image Gauge, the chemiluminescence level of the apical VIP36 band was ∼2-fold more than that of the basolateral VIP36 band (Fig. 3,lanes 1 and 2). These results indicated that VIP36 existed in both the apical and basolateral domains of the plasma membrane of MDCK cells in the ratio of ∼2:1. To examine whether there is a correlation between the distribution of VIP36 and VIP36-recognized glycoproteins in the polarized plasma membrane, we determined also the distribution of the VIP36-recognized glycoproteins in the polarized plasma membrane of MDCK cells. The apical and basolateral plasma membrane proteins were separately biotinylated, detergent extracts were prepared, and these preparations were incubated with a recombinant fusion protein, GST-Vip36 (12Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which consisted of GST and a VIP36-derived peptide, or with GST alone. The membrane proteins bound to GST-Vip36 and GST were collected using glutathione-Sepharose beads, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by detection of biotinylated proteins using streptavidin-HRP and chemiluminescence reagent. As shown in Fig.4, the apical membrane contained more glycoproteins bound to GST-Vip36 than the basolateral membrane. When the chemiluminescence of each lane was measured using Image Gauge (Fuji Photo Film), the amount of VIP36-binding glycoproteins in the apical membrane was estimated to be ∼2-fold more than that in the basolateral membrane, although the total amount of biotinylated proteins derived from the apical membrane was similar to that of biotinylated proteins derived from the basolateral membrane (TableI). In addition, the amount of VIP36-binding glycoproteins decreased markedly upon treatment of the apical and basolateral proteins with Endo H (Fig. 4 and Table I). This confirmed that VIP36 recognized high mannose-type glycans and indicated that our assay system for measuring VIP36-binding glycoproteins worked well.Table IDistribution of VIP36-recognized glycoproteins in polarized of MDCK cellsApicalBasolateral10−7 AU/chamber1-aValues are the averages of duplicate assays with a variation of <8% between duplicates.

Open table in a new tab We also examined the amount of apical and basolateral secretory glycoproteins that was capable of binding to VIP36. The apical and basolateral secretory proteins of MDCK cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, collected separately, and then incubated with GST-Vip36 or GST. When the secretory glycoproteins bound to GST-Vip36 and GST were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose beads, the radioactivity of VIP36-binding glycoproteins in the apical preparation was ∼2-fold more than that in the basolateral preparation, although the total radioactivity of the apical secretory proteins was similar to that of the basolateral secretory proteins (Table I). Upon Endo H treatment of the apical and basolateral secretory proteins, the radioactivity of VIP36-binding glycoproteins became negligible (Table I). These results indicated that the membrane and secretory glycoproteins, which were capable of binding to VIP36, were transported ∼2-fold more efficiently to the apical domain than to the basolateral domain of polarized MDCK cells. Thus, the apical/basolateral ratio of the transport of VIP36-recognized glycoproteins was correlated with that of VIP36 in MDCK cells. To address the function of VIP36, we constructed strains of MDCK cells that overproduced VIP36 and a mutant VIP36 defective in its lectin activity. The N-terminal luminal domain of VIP36 shows homology to lectins of leguminous plants (9Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1994; 77: 625-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In particular, the carbohydrate-binding sites and the metal-binding site of leguminous plant lectins are well conserved in VIP36. Based on sequence similarity among plant lectins and VIP36, Asp-131 of VIP36 was assumed to be a residue essential for its lectin activity. Therefore, we prepared a bacterially produced mutant GST-Vip36 in which the Asp residue corresponding to Asp-131 of VIP36 was replaced with Asn (Fig.5A), and we examined the binding activity to glycoproteins. Unlike the original GST-Vip36, the mutant GST-Vip36 was incapable of binding to35S-glycoproteins of MDCK cells at all (Fig.5B). This indicated that the mutation changing Asp-131 to Asn (D131N) in VIP36 resulted in loss of lectin activity. We introduced the D131N mutation into a full-length VIP36 cDNA clone carried by a mammalian expression vector and then introduced the wild type VIP36 cDNA and the mutant VIP36 cDNA into MDCK cells by transfection. Stable transfectants obtained (designated as MDCK/VIP36 and MDCK/mVIP36, respectively), which overproduced the wild type of VIP36 or the D131N-mutant VIP36 at a similar level, were purified and subjected to biochemical characterization. When the distribution of VIP36 (or mutant VIP36) in MDCK, MDCK/VIP36, and MDCK/mVIP36 cells was analyzed, we unexpectedly found that overproduction of VIP36 enhanced the apical distribution of VIP36; the apical/basolateral ratios of VIP36 in MDCK/VIP36 and MDCK/mVIP36 were 3.5 and 3.6, respectively, whereas it was 1.9 in MDCK cells (Fig. 3). This finding led us to examine whether or not the enhancement of apical distribution of VIP36 had an effect on the distributions of VIP36-recognized glycoproteins in polarized plasma membrane. The apical/basolateral ratios of membrane and secretory proteins that were capable of binding to VIP36 were 4.6 and 5.8, respectively, in the case of MDCK/VIP36 cells and 2.4 and 1.9, respectively, in the case of MDCK cells (Table II). Thus, in MDCK/VIP36 cells, the apical distribution of both VIP36 and VIP36-recognized glycoproteins was enhanced coincidentally. In contrast to MDCK/VIP36 cells, the MDCK/mVIP36 cells exhibited normal apical/basolateral ratios of VIP36-recognized membrane glycoproteins and secretory glycoproteins, similar to those exhibited by MDCK cells (Table II). Furthermore, overproduction of VIP36, but not that of the mutant, led to a striking increase in the apical secretion of glycoproteins that bound to VIP36 (Table II). In contrast, overproduction of the mutant VIP36 inhibited the secretion of glycoproteins that bound to VIP36. These results involving MDCK/VIP36 and MDCK/mVIP36 suggested that VIP36 was involved in the transport and sorting of glycoproteins bearing high mannose-type glycan(s).Table IIPlasma membrane and secretory glycoproteins that bound to VIP36 in polarized MDCK, MDCK/VIP36, and MDCK/mVIP36 cellsPlasma membrane glycoproteinsSecretory glycoproteinsapical (a)basolateral (b)a/b2-aRatios are the average of triple assays (p < 0.02).apical (a)basolateral (b)a/b2-aRatios are the average of triple assays (p < 0.02).× 10−6 AU× 10−4 dpmMDCK1.020.432.41.880.991.9MDCK/VIP361.430.314.67.681.325.8MDCK/mVIP360.790.402.00.740.322.3For preparation of domain selectively plasma membrane, either the apical or basolateral surface proteins were biotinylated and purified by means of an avidin column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For preparation of 35S-labeled secretory proteins, the cells cultured on polycarbonate filters were labeled for 1 h with 250 μCi/ml Expre35S35S and incubated for another 2 h after washing the cells, and the medium was collected from the apical and basolateral chambers as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The domain selectively plasma membrane and secretory proteins were subjected to binding assay to GST/Vip36.2-a Ratios are the average of triple assays (p < 0.02).

As described above, the results obtained from the experiments involving bulk membrane and secretory glycoproteins suggested that VIP36 was involved in the transport and sorting of glycoproteins. To confirm the involvement of VIP36 in the transport of glycoproteins, next we performed experiments focusing on a major apical secretory glycoprotein in MDCK cells. Clusterin is an 80-kDa glycoprotein, and it is released as a disulfide-linked heterodimeric complex (after intracellular proteolytic maturation) from the apical surface of the polarized MDCK cells (22Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Clusterin contains seven potential N-glycosylation sites, three in the 35-kDa subunit and four in the 45-kDa subunit, and all N-glycosylation sites are used (23Hartmann K. Rauch J. Urban J. Parczyk K. Diel P. Pilarsky D. Appel D. Haase W. Mann K. Weller A. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9924-9931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following results indicated that clusterin carried at least one high mannose-type glycan recognized by VIP36. After immunoprecipitation of [3H]glucosamine-labeled clusterin, the 3H-labeled N-glycans were released from clusterin precipitated by Protein A beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in TableIII, 92.5% of the total radioactivity of3H-labeled N-glycans was recovered as complex type glycans, consistent with the previous results (22Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the radioactivity, which amounted to 7.5% of the total radioactivity, was recovered in a high mannose-type glycan fraction. Since a high mannose-type glycan contains only 2 mol ofN-acetylglucosamine residues, whereas most of complex type glycans abundant in MDCK cells contain 5 mol ofN-acetylglucosamine, 2T. Ohkura, S. Hara-Kuge, A. Seko, and K. Yamashita, manuscript in preparation.this result indicated that over 15% of total N-glycans of clusterin was of high mannose-type glycans. Thus, one of sevenN-glycans of clusterin was most likely of high mannose-type glycan.Table IIIThe N-glycan structures of clusterinStructureRecovered radioactivity% molar ratiodpmHigh mannose-type glycans1,8507.5Complex type glycans Neutral glycans9,65039.2 Sialylated glycans11,32046.0 Sulfated glycans1,7807.3Clusterin that was metabolic-labeled with [3H]glucosamine was immunoprecipitated with anti-clusterin antibody, and 3H-labeledN-glycans were released by N-glycanase. Open table in a new tab Clusterin that was metabolic-labeled with [3H]glucosamine was immunoprecipitated with anti-clusterin antibody, and 3H-labeledN-glycans were released by N-glycanase. To examine whether the high mannose-type glycan of clusterin, Man8or9GlcNAc2, is recognized by VIP36, the detergent extract from MDCK cells was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-VIP36 antibody followed by immunoblot with anti-clusterin antibody. As shown in Fig. 6a, clusterin was co-precipitated with VIP36 (lane 1). This co-precipitation was not observed when the detergent extract was treated with Endo H (Fig. 6a, lane 2). When the detergent extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-clusterin antibody, VIP36 was co-precipitated with clusterin (Fig.6b, lane 1). These results indicated that the high mannose-type glycan of clusterin was recognized by VIP36 and that the remaining glycans were processed to complex type glycans during intracellular transport (Table III). To examine whether or not overproduction of VIP36 has an effect on the secretion of clusterin, MDCK, MDCK/VIP36, and MDCK/mVIP36 cells were subjected to the pulse-chase experiment with [35S]methionine/cysteine followed by the immunoprecipitation of clusterin secreted from the apical plasma membrane. In 30 min of chase time, a significant amount of [35S]clusterin was secreted by MDCK/VIP36 cells (see Fig.8, lane 3) but not by MDCK cells (see Fig. 8, lane 7), implying that the rate of secretion of clusterin from MDCK/VIP36 cells was faster than that in MDCK cells (Fig.7, a and c, and Fig. 8). On the other hand, overproduction of mutant VIP36 inhibited the secretion of clusterin, with the result that the rate of secretion of clusterin from MDCK/mVIP36 cells was slower than that in MDCK cells (Fig. 7, a and c). At the chase time of 2 h, MDCK/VIP36, MDCK, and MDCK/mVIP36 cells, respectively, secreted 54, 33, and 25% of the radioactivity incorporated into clusterin during the pulse-labeling period (Fig. 7c). These results indicated that the overproduction of VIP36 in MDCK cells led to an increase in the rate of clusterin transport. In contrast to the secretion of glycosylated clusterin, the secretion of galectin-3, which is a non-glycosylated apical secretory protein in MDCK cells (24Lindstedt R. Apodaca G. Barondes S.H. Mostov K.E. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not affected by the overproduction of VIP36 (Fig. 7, b andd). Thus, VIP36 seemed to be involved in the transport of glycoproteins such as clusterin.Figure 7Transport of newly synthesized clusterin and galectin-3 in MDCK, MDCK/VIP36, and MDCK/mVIP36 cells. The polarized MDCK, MDCK/VIP36, and MDCK/mVIP36 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min and chased for the indicated periods.

Recently, it has become evident that some specific glycans and intracellular lectins recognizing specific glycans play important roles in intracellular glycoprotein transport (1Dahm N.M. Lobel P.

Bio. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the functional role of an intracellular lectin, VIP36, which recognizes high mannose-type glycans containing α1→2 mannose residues (12Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Inconsistent with our finding that a significant fraction of VIP36 is localized to the plasma membrane, Füllekrug et al. (11Füllekrug J. Scheiffele P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2813-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that, unlike overexpressed VIP36, endogenous VIP36 is not detected on the plasma membrane of MDCK cells. This inconsistency might be attributed to the difference in the antibody used for the detection and/or to the alteration of property of MDCK cells during cell passages. VIP36 is localized to the early secretory pathway, cycling between ER-Golgi intermediate structures and the Golgi complex (21Dahm T. White J. Grill S. Füllekrug J. Stelzer H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1481-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and it is localized also to the plasma membrane in a significant amount, at least in the case of our MDCK cells. Therefore, it is likely that, at the late Golgi or trans-Golgi Network, a large fraction of VIP36 is retrieved to ER-Golgi intermediate structures, and a small but significant fraction of VIP36 is exported out to the plasma membrane. It is uncertain whether VIP36 cycles between the plasma membrane and the Golgi complex or endosomes. VIP36 has no obvious internalization signal in its short cytoplasmic tail. However, there is the possibility that VIP36 is associated with plasma membrane protein(s) carrying cytoplasmic internalization signal and is therefore co-internalized with such proteins. It is also possible that VIP36 has an unknown internalization signal. To clarify the functional role of VIP36, we are currently examining whether VIP36 is internalized at the cell surface or not. In the polarized plasma membrane of MDCK cells, both VIP36 and VIP36-recognized membrane proteins exhibited an apical-predominant distribution, their apical/basolateral ratios being ∼2. In addition, secretory glycoproteins recognized by VIP36 were secreted ∼2-fold more efficiently from the apical membrane than from the basolateral membrane. Thus, the apical/basolateral ratio of the transport of VIP36-recognized glycoproteins was correlated with that of VIP36 in MDCK cells. When VIP36 was overproduced in MDCK cells, the apical/basolateral ratio of plasma membrane VIP36 was changed from ∼1.9 to ∼3.5. Furthermore, the overproduction of VIP36 induced a marked enhancement of the apical distribution of VIP36-recognized glycoproteins and strikingly stimulated the apical secretion of VIP36-recognized glycoprotein. In contrast, the overproduction of a mutant VIP36 without lectin activity did not affect the distribution of VIP36-recognized glycoprotein in the plasma membrane, although the apical/basolateral ratio of the plasma membrane mutant VIP36 was very similar to that of overproduced VIP36 and 1.9-fold more than that of VIP36 produced at the usual (non-overproduction) level. Interestingly, the overproduction of mutant VIP36 inhibited the secretion of VIP36-recognized glycoproteins. In addition, we showed that a major apical secretory glycoprotein of MDCK cells, clusterin, carried at least one high mannose-type glycan, which was recognized by VIP36, and that the rate of clusterin transport was increased by the overproduction of VIP36 in MDCK cells. These results indicated that VIP36 is involved in the transport and sorting of glycoproteins through its lectin activity in polarized MDCK cells. Consistent with the view that the lectin activity of VIP36 is involved in the transport and sorting of glycoproteins, several reports have indicated that N-linked glycans are one of the sorting signals for apical transport. An apical secretory protein, erythropoietin, is secreted equally from the apical and basolateral domains of the plasma membrane when its threeN-glycosylation sites are removed by site-directed mutagenesis (25Kitagawa Y. Sano Y. Ueda M. Higashio K. Narita H. Okano M. Matsumoto S. Sasaki R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly, Scheiffele et al. (26Scheiffele P. Perânen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) have shown that a growth hormone, HG, which is a non-glycosylated protein secreted equally from the apical and basolateral domains of the plasma membrane, is secreted preferentially from apical membrane when an N-glycosylation site is introduced by mutagenesis. Furthermore, glycine transporter GLYT2, which localizes in the apical surface in polarized MDCK cells, was distributed in a non-polarized manner by unglycosylation (27Martínez-Maza R. Poyatos I. López-Corcuera B. Nuéñez E. Giménez C. Zafra F. Aragón C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2168-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The intracellular lectins calnexin and calreticulin are chaperons, functioning in quality control of newly synthesized glycoproteins in the ER (2, 3 and 4). Another intracellular lectin, ERGIC-53, may function as a receptor for cargo glycoprotein in the ER-to-ERGIC transport vesicle (5Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.-P. Nat. Cell. Bio. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In this study, VIP36 was shown to be involved in the transport and sorting of glycoproteins and localized to the early secretion pathway and to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, all intracellular lectins identified so far recognize high mannose-type glycans, although the recognized mannosyl residues in high mannose-type glycans are different among them. These observations concerning the localization and binding specificity of intracellular lectins raise the possibility that intracellular lectins cooperate in the ER-to-plasma membrane transport of glycoproteins carrying high mannose-type glycans.

We have used resonance Raman spectroscopy to characterize the heme environment of purified recombinant human indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (hIDO). In the absence ofl-Trp, the spectrum of the Fe3+ form displayed six-coordinate, mixed high and low spin character. Addition ofl-Trp triggered a transition to predominantly low spin with two Fe-OH− stretching modes identified at 546 and 496 cm−1, suggesting H-bonding between the NH group of the pyrrole ring of l-Trp and heme-bound OH−. The distal pocket of Fe3+ hIDO was explored further by an exogenous heme ligand, CN−; again, binding ofl-Trp introduced strong H-bonding and/or steric interactions to the heme-bound CN−. On the other hand, the spectrum of Fe2+ hIDO revealed a five-coordinate and high spin heme with or without l-Trp bound. The proximal Fe-His stretching mode, identified at 236 cm−1, did not shift upon l-Trp addition, indicating that the proximal Fe-His bond strength is not affected by binding of the substrate. The high Fe-His stretching frequency suggests that Fe2+ hIDO has a strong “peroxidase-like” Fe–His bond. Using CO as a structural probe for the distal environment of Fe2+ hIDO revealed that binding of l-Trp in the distal pocket converted IDO to a peroxidase-like enzyme. Binding of l-Trp also caused conformational changes to the heme vinyl groups, which were independent of changes of the spin and coordination state of the heme iron. Together these data indicate that the strong proximal Fe–His bond and the strong H-bonding and/or steric interactions betweenl-Trp and dioxygen in the distal pocket are likely crucial for the enzymatic activity of hIDO.

In the case ofl-Trp, N-formylkynurenine is the primary product (Scheme FS1), and the reaction represents the first and rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway, the major Trp catabolic pathway in mammals. The dioxygenase is ubiquitous in nonhepatic tissue where it is induced mainly by interferon-γ in response to a variety of infectious agents (such as influenza, tuberculosis, and malaria) and chronic inflammatory disorders (3Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Redox Rep. 1999; 4: 199-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The precise role of IDO remains unclear, although its induction and the metabolism of l-Trp along the kynurenine pathway are implicated in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including antimicrobial and antitumor defense, neuropathology, immunoregulation, and antioxidant activity (3Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Redox Rep. 1999; 4: 199-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). IDO is a ∼42-kDa monomeric protein containing protoporphyrin IX as the sole prosthetic group that is essential for enzymatic activity (1Hayaishi O.

These myoglobins and IDO contain two highly conserved His residues, postulated to be the proximal and distal heme-coordinating residues (6Suzuki T. Kawamichi H. Imai K. J.

Indeed the dioxygenase was first isolated from rabbit intestine (1Hayaishi O.

The reduced, catalytically active Fe2+ form readily autoxidizes, especially in the presence of a substrate (4Hirata F. Ohnishi T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

A reducing cofactor is required to initiate and sustain enzyme activity, and this is usually achieved in vitro using methylene blue and ascorbic acid (8Ohnishi T. Hirata F. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

The in vivo cofactor(s) remains unknown, with superoxide anion radical being one possible candidate as it can activate rIDO and is incorporated intol-Trp (4Hirata F. Ohnishi T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1979; 254: 3288-3294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rIDO can bind a variety of relatively large substrates and inhibitors, indicating a large substrate binding pocket (13Sono M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5400-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Sono M. Cady S.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5392-5399Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Sono M.

Previous studies of rIDO using (magnetic) circular dichroism, electronic absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy showed that substrate-free Fe3+ rIDO is six-coordinate and predominantly high spin and that substrate binding triggers protein conformational changes and an increase in low spin signals due to the coordination of the distal His residue to the heme (17Sono M. Dawson J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 789: 170-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).l-Trp has a higher affinity for Fe2+ than Fe2+·CO and Fe3+ rIDO, and based on this it was proposed that the Fe2+ enzyme bindsl-Trp before dioxygen in the catalytic reaction cycle (11Sono M. Taniguchi T. Watanabe Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1339-1345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the structural features underlying the chemical reactivity of IDO in more detail, we have measured the resonance Raman spectra of recombinant human indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (hIDO) and its cyanide, carbon monoxide, and l-Trp complexes. The data show that the distal and proximal heme environments of hIDO are distinctly different from that of conventional Mb and thatl-Trp binds closely but not directly to the distal side of the heme iron. Together they suggest that the strong proximal Fe–His bond and the strong H-bonding and/or steric interactions imposed byl-Trp on dioxygen in the distal pocket are likely to play crucial roles in the catalytic reaction of hIDO. CO, 13C18O, K13C15N, K13CN, and D218O were purchased from Icon (Mt. Marion, NY), and KC15N was from Cambridge Isotopes. All other materials were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest available purity. hIDO was expressed and purified as a fusion protein to a hexahistidyl tag as detailed elsewhere (18Littlejohn T.K. Takikawa O. Skylas D. Jamie J.F. Walker M.J. Truscott R.J.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Previous studies established that the hexahistidyl tag does not affect the physical properties of the enzyme (18Littlejohn T.K. Takikawa O. Skylas D. Jamie J.F. Walker M.J. Truscott R.J.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Before use, hIDO was gel-filtered through a Sephadex G-25 column eluted with 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm EDTA. The heme content of hIDO, assessed by the ratio of absorbance at 406 to 280 nm, was 1.6 ± 0.2, and the specific activity, measured by the methylene blue/ascorbate assay (11Sono M. Taniguchi T. Watanabe Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1339-1345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was 90 ± 20 mol of l-Trp/min/mol of enzyme. This activity is comparable to that of native human (89 mol/min/mol; Ref. 18Littlejohn T.K. Takikawa O. Skylas D. Jamie J.F. Walker M.J. Truscott R.J.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and rabbit IDO (∼108 mol/min/mol; Ref. 11Sono M. Taniguchi T. Watanabe Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1339-1345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of hIDO activity after resonance Raman experiments showed <10% loss of activity due to laser-induced damage to the protein. Concentrated hIDO was diluted to a final concentration of ∼30 μm in phosphate buffer, and ∼100 μl was used for resonance Raman measurements in a septum-sealed cell. Ferrous and Fe2+·CO hIDO were prepared by anaerobic reduction with sodium dithionite and introduction of CO gas by syringe injection. Ferric cyanide complexes were prepared by addition of a small amount of solid potassium cyanide (CN−) to the Fe3+ sample. Stocks ofl-Trp (50 mm) were prepared in phosphate buffer and added to samples as indicated. Spectra recorded in D218O were prepared by dilution of concentrated hIDO in an appropriate volume of D218O (80–90% final volume of D218O). The electronic absorption spectrum of the samples was recorded before and after every experiment to confirm sample purity and stability. All resonance Raman measurements were made using the instrumentation described previously (19Yeh S.R. Couture M. Ouellet Y. Guertin M. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1679-1684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, the output at 413.1 nm from a krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) (∼5 milliwatts) was focused to a ∼30-μm spot on a cell rotating at ∼1000 rpm. For Fe2+·CO complexes, laser power was kept at <2 milliwatts to avoid ligand photodissociation. The acquisition time was typically 10–15 min. The scattered light was collected at right angles to the incident beam and focused on the entrance slit (100 μm) of a 1.25 m Spex spectrometer (Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ) where it was dispersed and then detected by a CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Princeton, NJ). For calibration, the lines of indene in the 170–1750 cm−1 region were recorded daily. All measurements were done at room temperature. We used 413.1 nm laser light in resonance with the strong Soret electronic transition of heme. This yielded a resonance Raman spectrum of Fe3+ hIDO with several intense bands that can be assigned to totally symmetric vibrational modes of the porphyrin ring system (Fig. 1). For the substrate-free enzyme (Fig. 1B, top), the strongest band was the oxidation-state marker band ν4 at 1370 cm−1, typical for Fe3+ heme. The high frequency region also showed a heme peripheral vinyl group stretching band at 1621 cm−1. The porphyrin core-size marker bands ν3 and ν2 were observed at 1483 and 1563 cm−1, respectively, characteristic of a six-coordinate high spin heme with shoulders at 1505 and ∼1578 cm−1, respectively, characteristic of a six-coordinate low spin heme (20Spiro T.G. Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 1-37Google Scholar,21Wang J. Caughey W.S. Rousseau D.L. Feelisch M. Stammler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 427-454Google Scholar). The mixed spin character of Fe3+ hIDO is similar to mammalian globins (22Feis A. Marzocchi M.P. Paoli M. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) in which the distal side of the heme iron is coordinated by a solvent water molecule. In the low frequency region of the substrate-free enzyme (Fig.1A, top), the most intense band was the characteristic heme marker band ν7 at 676 cm−1. The 250–450 cm−1 region of heme proteins displayed several bands that are assigned to porphyrin out-of-plane vibrations, Fe-porphyrin stretching, and peripheral vinyl and propionate group in-plane bending vibrations (23Hu S. Smith K.M. Sprio T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (477) Google Scholar). For hIDO the bands in this region were not resolved well and displayed differences in frequencies and relative intensities compared with sperm whale Mb (23Hu S. Smith K.M. Sprio T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, using this comparison the intense 335 cm−1 band was assigned to the Fe-porphyrin nitrogen stretching mode ν8 with vinyl bending character. The 384 and 416 cm−1 bands were assigned to propionate and vinyl in-plane bending modes, respectively, the frequency and intensity of which are sensitive to conformational changes of these heme peripheral groups (24Li X.-Y. Czernuszewicz R.S. Kincaid J.R. Stein P. Spiro T.G. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 47-61Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Addition of l-Trp to Fe3+ hIDO triggered a pronounced transition of the heme iron to six-coordinate and low spin as indicated by the increased intensities of ν3 and ν2 at 1500 and 1578 cm−1 (Fig.1B, bottom). To identify the distal ligand of the Fe3+·Trp complex, the H2O-D218O difference spectrum was obtained. In the isotope difference spectrum, all the heme modes are canceled out except those associated with the heme-bound hydroxide or water. Two vibrational bands at 546 and 496 cm−1 were observed (Fig. 2). They are similar to the ∼550 and ∼490 cm−1 bands observed in the alkaline form of globins (TableI), which were assigned to the Fe-OH− stretching modes (νFe-OH−) of the low spin and high spin heme, respectively (19Yeh S.R. Couture M. Ouellet Y. Guertin M. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1679-1684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Feis A. Marzocchi M.P. Paoli M. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Similarly we assigned the two bands in the hIDO Fe3+·Trp difference spectrum to νFe-OH−, although both bands may correspond to the same low spin species as a high spin species was not seen in the high frequency region of the spectrum (Fig. 1B,bottom). In the absence of l-Trp νFe-OH− bands were not observed for Fe3+ hIDO (Fig. 2) even at pH 10 when the distal water molecule was partially deprotonated and the contribution from the six-coordinate low spin component was increased (data not shown). These data suggest that l-Trp binds closely but not directly to the distal side of the heme iron, and the heme-bound hydroxide interacts with the NH group of the pyrrole ring of thel-Trp through an H-bond (SchemeFS2, II), which somehow enhances the νFe-OH− modes. Binding of l-Trp to hIDO also perturbed the heme vinyl groups as shown by the up-shift of the vinyl stretching mode from 1621 to 1626 cm−1 (Fig.1B) and the vinyl bending mode from 416 to 419 cm−1 (Fig. 1A).Table IIron-ligand vibrational frequencies (cm−1) for hIDO and other heme proteinsSpeciesFe2+Fe3+νFe-HisνFe-COδFe-COνC-OνFe-CN−δFe−CN−νFe-OH−hIDO −Trp2365185771933, 19531-aRef. 29.450410, 440NDhIDO +Trp2365425891901455410, 444496, 546Mb1-bRefs. 22, 23, 28, 30, and40.2205125771944453ND491 (HS) 550 (LS)Hb1-cRefs. 22, 28, and40.2155075781951452ND492 (HS) 553 (LS)HRP1-dRefs. 27, 40, and41.241, 244531, 5415901906, 1933453405, 422492 (HS) 502 (LS)CCP1-eRefs. 27 and 40.227, 248505, 5375871922, 1948445407, 445NDHRP, horseradish peroxidase; CCP, cytochrome-c peroxidase; ND, not determined; HS, high spin; LS, low spin.1-a Ref. 29Uchida K.

The proximal and distal His residues are depicted with the latter engaged in H-bonding with distal water (I). Binding of Trp to the Fe3+ enzyme promotes distal hydroxide binding by stabilization through H-bonding (II). The Fe2+·CO (III) and Fe2+·CO·Trp (IV) complexes are also depicted. The analogous CN− complexes would look similar to that depicted for CO. For the Fe2+ species, the proximal His is engaged in H-bonding with a neighboring amino acid residue (X−), which gives the imidazole ring of His imidazolate character that strengthens the proximal Fe–His bond.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HRP, horseradish peroxidase; CCP, cytochrome-c peroxidase; ND, not determined; HS, high spin; LS, low spin. The spectrum of Fe2+ hIDO provides structural information on the catalytically active enzyme. In the high frequency region, the ν4 band appeared intensely at 1353 cm−1 and the ν3 band at 1469 cm−1 (Fig. 3B), characteristic of a five-coordinate and high spin Fe2+ heme with His as a proximal ligand. In the low frequency region, a band at 236 cm−1 (Fig. 3A, top) was assigned as the proximal iron-His stretching mode νFe-His. This frequency is significantly higher than that observed for globins (∼220 cm−1), although it occurred in the 230–245 cm−1 range commonly observed for peroxidases (21Wang J. Caughey W.S. Rousseau D.L. Feelisch M. Stammler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 427-454Google Scholar, 25Yu N.T. Kerr E.A. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 39-95Google Scholar, 26Smulevich G. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Biomolecular Spectroscopy, Part A. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 163-193Google Scholar) (Table I). In contrast to the Fe3+ form, addition ofl-Trp did not induce a spin state change to Fe2+ hIDO as the ν3 band remained characteristic of five-coordinate and high spin heme (Fig.3B, bottom), supporting the notion that the substrate does not bind directly to the heme iron. In addition, the νFe-His (Fig. 3A) remained the same at 236 cm−1, indicating that the substrate does not affect the strength of the proximal Fe–His bond. The data suggest that the distal coordination position remains free in the catalytically active hIDO, allowing for the binding of dioxygen during the catalytic reaction cycle. It was not possible to study the interaction of O2 and l-Trp using the present techniques as the O2 complexes were too unstable. Instead we studied the resonance Raman spectra of the CN− and CO complexes of Fe3+ and Fe2+ hIDO, respectively, to obtain information on the interactions between the substrate and distal ligands. The high frequency region for the CN−complex displayed characteristics of a six-coordinate, low spin complex (Fig. 4). Addition of l-Trp caused pronounced changes to vinyl-associated bands, such as an increased frequency and intensity of the stretch at 1630 cm−1 (Fig. 4B, bottom), an up-shift and sharpening of the bend at 422 cm−1, and sharpening of ν8 at 328 cm−1 (Fig. 4A). The shoulder at 1639 cm−1 (Fig. 4B, top) was assigned to the porphyrin band ν10, which was buried in the strongly enhanced 1630 cm−1 band in the presence ofl-Trp. To further obtain the structural information of the heme bound CN− and thereby infer the chemical environment of the distal pocket, various isotopes, including13C14N, 12C15N,13C15N, and 12C14N, were used. In the low frequency region of the isotope difference spectra, at least two major isotope-sensitive bands were detected (Fig.5A). We assigned the bands at 450 and 410 cm−1 to the Fe-CN− stretching (νFe-CN−) and bending mode (δFe-CN−), respectively, associated with a linear but slightly tilted conformation of the CN− ligand (27al-Mustafa J. Sykora M. Kincaid J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10449-10460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Hirota S. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 15274-15279Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The assignment of the stretch and bend is supported by their respective disappearance in the C15N-13CN and13CN-13C15N difference spectra (Fig. 5A). We also noted another, weaker bending mode at 440 cm−1 that was assigned to a bent Fe-C-N conformation (27al-Mustafa J. Sykora M. Kincaid J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10449-10460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,28Hirota S. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 15274-15279Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the presence of l-Trp, similar stretching and bending modes were seen at 455 and 410 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 5B); the bending mode corresponding to a bent Fe-C-N linkage appeared at 444 cm−1. The enhancement of this mode in the presence of l-Trp suggests a steric and/or H-bonding interaction between the ligand and l-Trp. The other low frequency bands, which were not canceled out in the isotope difference spectra, are likely porphyrin modes coupled to the motion of the CN− ligand (28Hirota S. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 15274-15279Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The high frequency region of the spectrum of the Fe2+·CO complex of hIDO (Fig.6B, top) indicated a six-coordinate and low spin complex. Addition of l-Trp caused similar changes to vinyl-associated bands as described above for the Fe3+·CN− complex (Fig. 6B,bottom). The Fe-CO stretching (νFe-CO) and bending (δFe-CO) modes appeared prominently (Fig.6A) at 518 and 577 cm−1, respectively. This assignment is supported by the appearance of two isotope-sensitive bands at 518 and 577 cm−1 in the CO-13C18O difference spectrum (Fig.7A, top).Figure 7Fe2+·CO-Fe2+·13C18O difference spectra for hIDO in the absence and presence ofl-Trp.

The final concentration ofl-Trp in the bottom spectrum was 25 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the presence of l-Trp, νFe-CO and δFe-CO shifted to 542 and 589 cm−1 (Fig.6A, bottom), respectively, as reflected by the associated strong bands in the CO-13C18O difference spectrum (Fig. 7A, bottom). The presence of l-Trp also caused the δFe-CO mode to be narrowed and intensified (Fig. 6A), indicating a steric and/or H-bonding interaction imposed by l-Trp to the Fe-C-O moiety. The internal C-O stretch νC-O can sometimes be seen around 1900–1950 cm−1 for CO·heme complexes. In the case of hIDO, νC-O was not observed in the absence of l-Trp (Fig. 7B, top). However, in the presence of l-Trp, νC-Oappeared at 1901 cm−1 (Fig. 7B,bottom), a value close to that determined by IR spectroscopy for rIDO (29Uchida K. Bandow H. Makino R. Sakaguchi K. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1400-1406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relating the frequencies of νFe-CO and νC-Ocan give valuable information on the nature of the proximal ligand and the polarity of the distal pocket (see e.g. Refs. 25Yu N.T. Kerr E.A. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 39-95Google Scholar and30Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M. Zgierski M.Z. Spiro T.G. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 2000; 297: 11-17Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, separate correlation curves can be discerned for five-coordinate complexes and six-coordinate complexes with imidazoleversus thiolate as proximal ligand (Fig.8). The position along a curve is determined by either steric interactions or a local electric field generated by polar interactions. Positive dipoles originating from H-bonding interactions typically generate low νC-O and high νFe-CO, whereas negative dipoles do the opposite (30Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M. Zgierski M.Z. Spiro T.G. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 2000; 297: 11-17Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For example, in sperm whale Mb, the frequencies of the νFe-CO and νC-O bands are 512 and 1944 cm−1, respectively (30Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M. Zgierski M.Z. Spiro T.G. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 2000; 297: 11-17Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As the distal His is mutated to a nonpolar residue, νFe-CO becomes lower, and νC-O becomes higher as shown in Fig. 8 (31Li T. Quillin M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Similar effects are observed for peroxidases (30Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M. Zgierski M.Z. Spiro T.G. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 2000; 297: 11-17Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Feis A. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Thorneley R.N. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13575-13581Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The distal pockets of peroxidases are typically more polar than that in Mb; the data points therefore fall on the upper left corner of the imidazole correlation curve.

https://openalex.org/W2064713000,"The muscle protein catabolism present in rats with insulin-dependent diabetes and other catabolic conditions is generally associated with increased glucocorticoid production and mRNAs encoding components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The mechanisms that increase ubiquitin (UbC) expression have not been identified. We studied the regulation of UbC expression in L6 muscle cells because dexamethasone stimulates the transcription of this gene and others encoding components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Results ofin vivo genomic DNA footprinting experiments indicate that a protein(s) binds to Sp1 sites ∼50 bp upstream from theUbC transcription start site; dexamethasone changes the methylation pattern at these sites. Sp1 binds to DNA probes corresponding to the rat or human UbC promoter, and treating cells with dexamethasone increases this binding. Deletion and mutation analyses of the rat and human UbC promoters are consistent with an important role of Sp1 in UbC induction by glucocorticoids. Dexamethasone-induced ubiquitin expression is blocked by mithramycin, an inhibitor of Sp1 binding. UO126, a pharmacologic inhibitor of MEK1, also blocks UbCtranscriptional activation by dexamethasone; L6 cells transfected to express constitutively active MEK1 exhibit increased UbCpromoter activity. Thus, glucocorticoids increase UbCexpression in muscle cells by a novel transcriptional mechanism involving Sp1 and MEK1. The muscle protein catabolism present in rats with insulin-dependent diabetes and other catabolic conditions is generally associated with increased glucocorticoid production and mRNAs encoding components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The mechanisms that increase ubiquitin (UbC) expression have not been identified. We studied the regulation of UbC expression in L6 muscle cells because dexamethasone stimulates the transcription of this gene and others encoding components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Thus, glucocorticoids increase UbCexpression in muscle cells by a novel transcriptional mechanism involving Sp1 and MEK1. Skeletal muscle atrophy due to activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic system is a common consequence of catabolic conditions (e.g. metabolic acidosis, chronic renal failure, cancer cachexia, sepsis, or acute diabetes) in experimental animals or patients (reviewed in Ref. 1.Mitch W.E. Goldberg A.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The program of responses to catabolic stimuli consistently includes increased levels of mRNAs encoding ubiquitin, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and proteasome subunits. The increase in levels of mRNAs encoding ubiquitin and some of the proteasome subunits in atrophic muscle involves stimulation of transcription, at least in rats with chronic renal failure, acute diabetes, or sepsis (2.Bailey J.L.

Physiol. 1997; 272: R849-R856PubMed Google Scholar), but there is little information about the mechanism(s) that enhance transcription of these genes. In rats with metabolic acidosis, acute diabetes, sepsis, or starvation, glucocorticoids are required for the rise in mRNAs encoding proteasome subunits and ubiquitin as well as the increase in protein degradation (3.Mitch W.E.

These earlier studies were carried out in adrenalectomized rats but the complexity of identifying signaling pathways in intact animals makes it difficult to ascertain how transcription of ubiquitin and other pathway genes is regulated by glucocorticoids or other signals. In eukaryotes, a family of three genes (i.e. UbA,UbB, and UbC) encode protein products that are processed to yield free ubiquitin (8.Jentsch S. Seufert W. Hauser H.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The UbC mRNA is typically increased more than other ubiquitin mRNAs when there is evidence of muscle wasting in catabolic patients or when the ubiquitin-proteasome system is activated in muscle of catabolic rats (2.Bailey J.L.

The physiologic importance of the higher level of ubiquitin (UbC) mRNA is controversial because ubiquitin protein is present in the resting cell. However, in muscle of rats stimulated to degrade protein at an accelerated rate by starvation or denervation, Wing et al. found that the total content of ubiquitin (i.e. free ubiquitin and ubiquitin conjugated to proteins) was higher (15.Wing S.S. Haas A.L. Goldberg A.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 16.Medina R. Wing S.S. Goldberg A.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Since there was a concurrent increase in ubiquitin mRNA, it seems likely that enhanced UbCtranscription is an integral aspect of the program of responses that results in muscle atrophy. Other evidence for increased ubiquitin utilization in muscles of rats with cancer, sepsis, or acute diabetes includes greater amounts of ubiquitin conjugated to muscle proteins compared with results in muscle of control rats (10.Lecker S.H.

Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 297-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) characterized the human UbCpromoter region, and they identified potential binding sites for several transcription factors, including multiple Sp1 sites. We cloned the rat UbC promoter and noted conservation of many putative Sp1 binding sites between the rat and human promoters (20.Marinovic A.C. Mitch W.E. Price S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Despite the stimulation of UbC transcription by glucocorticoids, neither the rat nor human UbC promoter sequence contains a consensus glucocorticoid-response element. To understand how glucocorticoids increase the expression of UbC in muscle, we explored potential signaling pathways that regulate UbC expression in L6 muscle cells and found evidence for involvement of Sp1 and the MEK1 pathway. The human and ratUbC promoter sequences (GenBank™ accession numbers AF232305 and D63791, respectively) were amplified from genomic DNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using PCR. Forward primers (Table I) and a human reverse primer 5′-CACGCTAGCAACTAGCTGTGCCACACCCG-3′ or a rat reverse primer 5′-CAGCTAGCAACTAGCTGCGGGACGCGAG-3′ were used. Both the forward and reverse primers contained a NheI restriction site at the 5′-end. A rat UbC DNA fragment (rUbCmut (−137)) containing mutations in two Sp1 sites centered around −50 bp was generated by PCR using a forward mutagenesis primer and its complementary reverse primer (Table I). All promoter DNA segments were subcloned into the pGL2-Basic firefly reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). A plasmid containing the thromboxane synthase minimal promoter (−90 to +30) linked to the Renilla luciferase gene (pTS-RL) served as a control for transfection efficiency (21.Ibrahim N.M. Marinovic A.C. Price S.R. Young L.G. Frohlich O. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

Rat L6 myocytes from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were differentiated into myotubes by growing the cells to 70% confluence and then replacing the growth medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum (20.Marinovic A.C. Mitch W.E. Price S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The medium was replenished every 2 days. Transfection studies were performed with L6 myocytes and UbCpromoter luciferase reporter plasmids as described (20.Marinovic A.C. Mitch W.E. Price S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In all transfection experiments, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum after 24 h, and cells were maintained for 48 h before measuring luciferase activity. When the glucocorticoid responsiveness of theUbC promoter was tested, dexamethasone (100 nm; Sigma) was added to medium supplemented with 2% horse serum for 48 h. To examine the role of Sp1 transactivation in UbCexpression, some cells were transfected with 0.25 μg/well of a ratUbC promoter-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg/well of pTS-RL (Renilla luciferase control plasmid), and 0.25 μg/well of either the control expression vector, pCMV-EGFP (to express green fluorescent protein), or the Sp1 expression vector, pCGN-Sp1. In other studies, the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin (100 nm; Sigma) was added to transfected cells 1 h prior to treatment with dexamethasone or vehicle (24.Giraudo E. Primo L. Audero E. Gerber H.P.

Rutigliano C. Bianchi N. Mischiati C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 370-377PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was evaluated using trypan blue exclusion. To examine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent signaling in the response to glucocorticoids, a MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (Calbiochem) or its inactive analog U0124 (50 μm) was added to transfected cells 1 h before dexamethasone. Other cells were transiently co-transfected with the UbC promoter-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (rUbC (−340)) plus either pCMV-EGFP or pR4F-MEK1 to express a constitutively active MEK1 protein (23.Mansour S.J.

Western blot analyses for ubiquitin were performed after L6 myotubes were incubated with or without dexamethasone (1 μm). Some cells were treated with mithramycin (100 nm) and/or dexamethasone (1 μm) to study the effect of Sp1 in expression of ubiquitin protein. Cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of 83 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and 2.7% SDS; the lysates were passed through an insulin syringe to shear DNA. Glycerol and β-mercaptoethanol were added (final concentrations of 10 and 5%, respectively), and lysates were boiled for 5 min and passed through an insulin syringe again. Proteins (50 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 15% acrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was then baked at 75 °C for 30 min. A rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma or Calbiochem) was used to detect free and protein-conjugated ubiquitin. Western blots were developed using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences), and luminescence was measured using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). At other times, autoradiography was performed. Western blots for Sp1 were performed using polyclonal antibodies against a peptide sequence of rat Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and protein extracts from cells treated with dexamethasone for 6 h. To measure the cellular content of Sp1, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell debris was removed by brief centrifugation (5 min × 12,000 × g), and the supernatant proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. To examine the cellular distribution of Sp1, cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described (26.Du J. Mitch W.E. Wang X. Price S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19661-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Proteins (7 μg of nuclear extract or 20 μg of cytosolic extract) were separated by electrophoresis in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Western blot analyses were performed with the anti-Sp1 antibody and the Amersham Biosciences ECL detection system. L6 myotubes were treated with or without dexamethasone (100 nm, 12 h) before total RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). RNase protection assays were performed using total RNA (2 μg) and the rat UbC-specific and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antisense riboprobes as described (20.Marinovic A.C. Mitch W.E. Price S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Reaction products were separated in an 8% denaturing, polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. L6 myotubes were treated with or without dexamethasone (100 nm, 6 h). Nuclei from 1 × 107 cells were isolated (27.Groudine M. Peretz M. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and a run-off assay was performed as described (2.Bailey J.L. Wang X. England B.K. Price S.R. Ding X. Mitch W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1447-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). L6 myotubes were treated with or without dexamethasone (100 nm, 6 h). DNA footprinting of the UbC promoter was performed as described by Ping et al. (28.Ping D. Boekhoudt G. Zhang F. Morris A. Philipsen S. Warren S.T. Boss J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1708-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); both the coding and noncoding strands were analyzed. The sequences for the rat UbC coding strand primers were rUbCfwd-1 (5′-CACACAAAGCCCCTCACTCT-3′), rUbcfwd-2 (5′-GTTTTAGCCTGTCGCTTCCATTGCA-3′), and rUbCfwd-3 (5′-CTTCCATTGCAGAGATTGGACCGGG-3′). The sequences for the noncoding strand primers for the rat UbC gene were rUbCrev-1 (5′-GTGTTGGCTGCAGTCCTC-3′), rUbCrev-2 (5′-GAACTGGCGGTCTCGACG-3′), rUbCrev-3 (5′-CTGGCGGTCTCGACGGAGCTA-3′). rUbCfwd-1 or rUbCrev-1 was used in the first step of the footprinting process. Following ligation of the common linker (28.Ping D. Boekhoudt G. Zhang F. Morris A. Philipsen S. Warren S.T. Boss J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1708-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), rUbCfwd-2 or rUbCrev-2 was used for the amplification steps with the common linker primer. rUbCfwd-3 or rUbCrev-3 was end-labeled at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP and used for the final extension cycle. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from L6 myotubes as described by Dignam et al.(29.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). Some cells were treated with dexamethasone for 6 h. Protein-DNA binding reactions and gel electrophoresis were performed as described (28.Ping D. Boekhoudt G. Zhang F. Morris A. Philipsen S. Warren S.T. Boss J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1708-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear protein extracts (1 μg) were preincubated for 5 min on ice in a reaction buffer containing 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.12 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 200 ng of poly(dI/dC). In some instances, a double-stranded competitor probe (0.7 pmol) or an anti-Sp1 antibody (2 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was included in the preincubation mixture. Competitor probes were created by annealing complementary 40-base oligonucleotides. A [γ-32P]ATP 5′-end labeled, gel-purified, double-stranded probe (5 × 105 dpm) was added to each binding reaction (20-μl total volume), and the mixtures were incubated on ice for an additional 25 min before electrophoretic separation in a 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. The sequence of the sense strands of DNA probes used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays were as follows: human UbC (−319 to −280), 5′-TTTTGGCGCCTCCCGCGGGCGCCCCCCTCCTCACGGCGAG-3′; humanUbCmut1x (−319 to −280), 5′-TTTTGGCGCCTCCCGCGGGCGCCTACGTCCTCACGGCGAG-3′ (bases that are different from the corresponding wild-type sequence are underlined); human UbCmut2x (−319 to −280), 5′-TTTTGGAGAATCCCGCGGGCGCCTACGTCCTCACGGCGAG-3′; rat UbC (−67 to −28), 5′-CGGAGGAATCCAGGGGTGGGCG GGGCTCCCGATGACTATA-3′; rat UbCmut2x, 5′-CGGAGGAATCCAGGTTTGTTCGGGGCTCCCGATGACTATA-3′; the Sp1 and Sp1 mutant probes were described by Jones et al.(30.Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Incubating L6 muscle cells with dexamethasone for 18 h increased the levels of both free ubiquitin protein and the higher molecular weight ubiquitin-conjugated proteins by ∼50% (Fig. 1 A). UbC mRNA levels were increased ∼2-fold (p < 0.05) by dexamethasone (12 h; Fig. 1 B). Similarly, there was a 2-fold increase in UbC transcription as measured in nuclear run-off assays from cells treated with dexamethasone for 6 h (Fig. 1 C). Thus, glucocorticoids increase ubiquitin (UbC) expression in muscle cells through a transcriptional mechanism. To identify an element in the rat UbC promoter that is involved in the response to dexamethasone, we performed in vivo genomic DNA footprinting assays in L6 cell myotubes. In intact cells, interactions between transcription factors and DNA can cause guanine bases to be hypomethylated or hypermethylated during dimethyl sulfate treatment, compared with deproteinized DNA that is methylated in vitro. Footprinting analysis of the sense strand of the rat UbC promoter region that is adjacent to the transcription start site demonstrated that several guanine residues between −63 and −34 were hypermethylated in vivo in control cells (Fig. 2 A) compared with DNA that was methylated in vitro. Dexamethasone increased the in vivo methylation of several guanines in this region (Fig. 2, A and B). Guanines at −46 and −50 bp were hypomethylated in vivo, but there was no difference in the extent of their methylation between control and dexamethasone-treated cells. The guanines between −42 to −56 are located in two overlapping, putative Sp1 binding sites (Fig. 2 A). Footprinting analysis of the antisense strand was less informative because there are only two guanine residues in this region. Both guanines were hypomethylated, relative to the in vitromethylated DNA (data not shown), but dexamethasone treatment did not change the extent of their methylation. These results (summarized in Fig. 2 C) suggest that the Sp1 site(s) located ∼50 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the rat UbCpromoter is occupied in vivo and that its occupancy changes in response to dexamethasone treatment. Notably, there are multiple putative Sp1 binding sites in the first ∼340 bp upstream of the transcription start sites of the rat and human UbCpromoters, respectively (Fig. 2 C). Based on the results of the in vivo footprinting, we studied the transcription factor that binds to the putative Sp1 sites located ∼50 bp upstream of the transcription start site in the ratUbC promoter using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Treating L6 myotubes with dexamethasone increased the binding of a nuclear protein to a DNA probe that spans the Sp1 binding sites in the rat UbC promoter (i.e. corresponding to the positions where dexamethasone changed the in vivomethylation pattern; Fig. 3,lane 1 versus lane 2). Specificity of DNA-protein binding was demonstrated because the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ratUbC probe or consensus Sp1 competitor probe (containing three Sp1 sites) to the binding reaction prevented complex formation (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 5). When the Sp1 sites in the rat UbC probe or the consensus Sp1 competitor probes were altered (i.e. rUbC mut2x), the competitor probes did not block formation of the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 6). Evidence that the nuclear protein that binds to the UbC probe is Sp1 included the following. 1) The complex was supershifted by an anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 3, lane 7); antibodies to AP-1 or the p50/p65 subunits of NF-κB did not react with the protein-DNA complex (data not shown). 2) Recombinant Sp1 protein formed a complex with the UbC probe, and that complex migrated with a mobility indistinguishable from the endogenous L6 nuclear protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3, lane 9). 3) Mutating the two Sp1 sites in the rat UbC probe (−67 to +28) abolished its ability to form a DNA-protein complex with nuclear proteins isolated from dexamethasone-treated or control cells (Fig. 3, lanes 10 and 11). To demonstrate the importance of Sp1 sites located in the ratUbC transcription start site to the dexamethasone response, we performed transfection studies with rat UbCpromoter-firefly luciferase reporter plasmids. Previously, we demonstrated that dexamethasone stimulated luciferase activity by 250% in L6 cells transiently transfected with a rat UbCpromoter-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (rUbC (−340)) containing a segment of the rat UbC promoter from −340 to +3 (+1 denotes the start transcription site); the steroid receptor antagonist, RU486, completely blocked this induction (20.Marinovic A.C. Mitch W.E. Price S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A construct containing the −137 to +3 segment of the rat UbC promoter (rUbC (−137)) showed the same level of induction of luciferase activity as rUbC (−340) (Fig. 4). When cells were transfected with rUbCmut (−137) containing changes in the two overlapping Sp1 sites located ∼50 bp upstream of the start transcription site, there was significantly less induction of luciferase activity by dexamethasone as compared with rUbC (−137) (Fig. 4). Basal luciferase activity of rUbCmut (−137) (normalized for transfection efficiency) was also significantly decreased compared with the activity measured from cells transfected with rUbC(−137) (Fig. 4). These findings are consistent with the conclusion that Sp1 sites are important for both the basal expression of theUbC gene and its responsiveness to dexamethasone. The human UbC promoter, like the corresponding rat promoter, contains several putative Sp1 binding sites, so we tested whether glucocorticoids also stimulate its transcriptional activity in L6 cells. Dexamethasone significantly increased luciferase activity in cells transfected with constructs containing segments of the humanUbC promoter extending upstream of −371, but this stimulation was diminished in cells transfected with plasmids containing a promoter segment between −279 to +4 or shorter (Fig. 5 A). Tandem binding sites for Sp1 are located between −371 and −279 in the human UbCpromoter, consistent with the conclusion that Sp1 is important for the induction of the human UbC promoter by dexamethasone. Therefore, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from cells treated with or without dexamethasone and a probe to the −319 to −280 region of the human UbCpromoter. The results of these binding assays were identical to those we obtained with the rat UbC probe. (Fig. 5 B). Thus, our findings using the rat UbC promoter apply to the human UbC gene, because dexamethasone increased Sp1 binding to this promoter. To determine whether Sp1 regulates the activity of the UbCpromoter, we transiently co-transfected L6 cells with either a rat (rUbC (−340)) or human (hUbC (−655))UbC promoter-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid plus plasmids for expressing either enhanced green fluorescent protein (pCMV-EGFP as a control) or Sp1 (pCGN-Sp1). Overexpressing Sp1 increased basal firefly luciferase activity ∼2-fold above the level in control cells transfected with pCMV-EGFP (p < 0.05versus control for each plasmid; Fig. 6 A). We also tested whether mithramycin, an inhibitor of Sp1-DNA binding (24.Giraudo E. Primo L. Audero E. Gerber H.P. Koolwijk P. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Ferrara N. Bussolino F. J. Biol.

Science. 1987; 236: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study of GnT-V-deficient mice indicates that it is essential for tumor metastasis as well as for tumor growth (9.Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Clinical studies have shown increases in GnT-V activity in breast and hepatocellular carcinomas (10.Yao M. Zhou D.P. Jiang S.M. Wang Q.H. Zhou X.D. Tang Z.Y. Gu J.X. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 124: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11.Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 945-950PubMed Google Scholar). In human breast cancer cells, a positive correlation was observed between GnT-V activity and tumor size (11.Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 945-950PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that the expression of GnT-V in human colon cancer tissues was correlated with a poor prognosis and distant metastasis (12.Murata K. Miyoshi E. Kameyama M. Ishikawa O. Kabuto T. Sasaki Y. Hiratsuka M. Ohigashi H. Ishiguro S. Ito S. Honda H. Takemura F. Taniguchi N. Imaoka S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1772-1777PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that GnT-V level should be indicative of a poor prognosis in cases of colorectal cancer. These results strongly suggest that GnT-V plays a pivotal role in tumor malignancy. However, the detailed mechanisms of the regulation via GnT-V with respect to tumor size or metastasis remain unknown. To address this issue, we established GnT-V transfectants and examined the metastatic potentials of these cells. In the course of this study, we found that GnT-V transfectants induced dramatic increase in angiogenic activity. The induction of tumor angiogenesis by GnT-V is thought to be due to 1) increases in the expression/production of angiogenic factors, 2) changes in their function via the addition of β1–6 branching, and 3) other unknown mechanisms. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis by GnT-V, and the findings herein show that a secreted type of GnT-V itself was able to induce angiogenesis with no detectable mediation of glycosylation. In addition, we also found that a basic domain in GnT-V caused the direct release of FGF-2 from heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) on the cell surface and/or extracellular matrix. Our findings here strongly suggest that GnT-V is a bifunctional protein and that a secreted type of GnT-V protein itself plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis, acting as an angiogenic cofactor of FGF-2. A human colon carcinoma cell line, WiDr was cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% of fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Gene transfection was performed using the CELL FECTIN™ reagent (Invitrogen). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated as described previously (13.Suzuki K. Tatsumi H. Satoh S. Senda T. Nakata T. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1173-H1178PubMed Google Scholar), and cultured in MCDB131 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% of fetal bovine serum, human FGF-2 (10 ng/ml), and antibiotics. 5 × 105 cells of each glycosyltransferase transfectant were injected into the back of athymic mice. After 1 month, the mice were sacrificed. Tumor formation and angiogenesis were observed macroscopically. The CAM assay was performed as described previously with slight modifications (14.Yen L. You X.L. Moustafa A.A. Batist G. Hynes N.E. Mader S. Meloche S. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3460-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 15.Bernardini G. Spinetti G. Ribatti D. Camarda G. Morbidelli L. Ziche M. Santoni A. Capogrossi M.C. Napolitano M. Blood. 2000; 96: 4039-4045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CAMs from 8-day-old fertilized white Leghorn chicken embryos were used in this assay. The cells were seeded onto a collagen sponge at a density of 1 × 105 cells and then incubated for 4 h. Collagen sponges were deposited onto 5-mm round silicon rings on the CAM. In the case of purified GnT-V proteins, each GnT-V mutant protein was placed on 1% methylcellulose. Each sample was deposited onto 5-mm round silicon rings on the CAM. The CAMs were incubated for 48 h and photographed using a digital camera. HUVEC were seeded in a 96-well plate coated with type I collagen (2 × 103cells/well). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with MCDB131 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and starved for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with the conditioned medium from glycosyltransferase transfectants or MCDB131 medium containing human FGF-2 (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), GnT-VΔ73, Δ188, Δ233, or Δ436, with or without a neutralizing antibody against FGF-2 (R & D systems). After 24 h, the cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) for 8 h. Incorporation was evaluated by a Micro96 Harvester (SKATRON) and then analyzed with a MicroBeta-Counter (Wallac). The results represent the average ± S.E. of samples assayed in six wells. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and essentially the same results were obtained in each case. Two types of GnT-V proteins, GnT-VΔ73 and Δ188, both of which are soluble forms, were prepared in a baculovirus-insect cell system (16.Sasai K. Ikeda Y. Fujii T. Tsuda T. Taniguchi N. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For the construction of a transfer plasmid for GnT-VΔ233, the plasmid for GnT-VΔ187 was digested with EcoRI and EagI. The resulting 1521-bp fragment, which includes Glu234–Leu741 of hGnT-V and the C terminus polyhistidine tag, was then ligated into theEcoRI-EagI site of a transfer vector, pAcGP67-A (PharMingen). For the construction of a transfer plasmid for GnT-VΔ436, the plasmid for GnT-VΔ187 was digested withEcoRV and EagI. The resulting 912-bp fragment, which includes Ile437–Leu741 of hGnT-V and the C terminus polyhistidine-tag, was then ligated into theEcoRV-EagI site of the pAcGP67-A vector. The resulting transfer plasmids were transfected into Sf21 cells in order to produce a recombinant virus by methods described previously (17.Ikeda Y. Koyota S. Ihara H. Yamaguchi Y. Korekane H. Tsuda T. Ken S. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The recombinant enzymes derived from the infected Sf21 cells were then purified by Ni2+-chelating affinity chromatography (16.Sasai K. Ikeda Y. Fujii T. Tsuda T. Taniguchi N. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Each GnT-V mutant protein (100 ng) was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The proteins were visualized by silver staining. The KRKRKK peptide, corresponding to amino acids 264–269 of human GnT-V, and the FSGGPL peptide (amino acids 291–296) were synthesized using a Peptide Synthesizer A432 (Applied Biosystems). They were purified using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and their mass and purity were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Voyager-DE™ RP; PerSeptive Biosystems). The concentration of FGF-2 was measured as described previously (19.Barillari G. Albonici L. Franzese O. Modesti A. Liberati F. Barillari P. Ensoli B. Manzari V. Santeusanio G. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1161-1166PubMed Google Scholar). HUVEC cells, seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well onto collagen-coated 12-well plates, were washed twice with PBS, and then the medium was then replaced with MCDB131 plus 0.1% BSA (0.5 ml/well), in the presence or absence of each molecule: GnT-VΔ73, GnT-VΔ436, the KRKRKK peptide, the FSGGPL peptide, and heparin. Cells were incubated for 2 h on a rotating plate at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to remove debris. These samples were assayed using an FGF-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (R & D Systems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Our previous studies demonstrated that the expression level of GnT-V is highly correlated with a poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (12.Murata K. Miyoshi E. Kameyama M. Ishikawa O. Kabuto T. Sasaki Y. Hiratsuka M. Ohigashi H. Ishiguro S. Ito S. Honda H. Takemura F. Taniguchi N. Imaoka S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1772-1777PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we established stable transfectants of it using the human colon cancer cell line WiDr, along with control transfectants of β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III and α1,6-fucosyltransferase. WiDr cells express the above glycosyltransferases at very low or negligible levels. When these transfectants were transplanted to athymic mice, transplanted tumors of GnT-V transfectants showed a dramatic hypervascularization, compared with the other transplants (Fig. 1 A). To verify the induction of angiogenesis by the GnT-V transfectants, the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryo (CAM assay) was employed (14.Yen L. You X.L. Moustafa A.A. Batist G. Hynes N.E. Mader S. Meloche S. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3460-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,15.Bernardini G. Spinetti G. Ribatti D. Camarda G. Morbidelli L. Ziche M. Santoni A. Capogrossi M.C. Napolitano M. Blood. 2000; 96: 4039-4045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An increased invasion of blood capillaries into the collagen sponge was observed only in the case of the GnT-V transfectants (Fig. 1 B). This angiogenesis was also observed when the GnT-V gene was transiently expressed in WiDr, COS-1, and Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown). These data suggest that the induction of angiogenesis is a common effect of GnT-V gene transfection rather than a unique phenomenon limited to the WiDr clones. To evaluate the induction of angiogenesis in the GnT-V transfectants, we measured their effects on DNA synthesis in human umbilical vein epithelial cells (HUVEC) (20.Soker S. Gollamudi-Payne S. Fidder H. Charmahelli H. Klagsburn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31582-31588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis of HUVEC was increased as the result of replacement with the conditioned medium from the GnT-V transfectants, whereas no effects were detectable when the conditioned medium from the other transfectants was used (Fig. 1 C). These data indicate that the GnT-V transfectants secreted a growth-stimulating factor for HUVEC. The addition of fresh medium (CTR) increased the HUVEC proliferation to a higher level than that of the conditioned medium from the GnT-V transfectants. This is probably due to a supply of growth-stimulating factors such as FGF-2 that are contained in fetal bovine serum. Next, angiogenic activity in the conditioned medium from the GnT-V transfectants was characterized using column chromatography, monitoring HUVEC proliferation-stimulating activity. With heparin affinity chromatography, a high activity fraction was eluted with 0.3m NaCl (data not shown). This characteristic is completely different from hitherto known angiogenic factors (e.g.FGF-1, FGF-2, VEGF, placental growth factor (PlGF), and hepatocyte growth factor), which are eluted with 0.8–1.5 m NaCl (21.Hauser S. Weich H.A. Growth Factor. 1993; 9: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 22.Gohda E. Tubouchi H. Nakayama S. Hirono S. Sakiyama O. Takahashi K. Miyazaki H. Hashimoto S. Daikuhara Y. J.

Growth Factor. 1990; 4: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When Western blot analysis of the eluted fractions was performed using an anti-GnT-V antibody, its reactivity corresponded to the HUVEC proliferation activity (data not shown). It is known that GnT-V, as well as other glycosyltransferases, is secreted from tumor cells (26.Chen L. Zhang N. Adler B. Browne J. Freigen N. Pierce M. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27.Gu J. Nishikawa A. Turuoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem.

Biochem. 1986; 21: 119-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), although the physiological significance of this remains unknown. To address the hypothesis that a secreted type of GnT-V itself induces the proliferation of HUVEC, we prepared a special type of recombinant GnT-V, referred to as GnT-VΔ73, which lacks the transmembrane domain but in which glycosyltransferase activity is retained (16.Sasai K. Ikeda Y. Fujii T. Tsuda T. Taniguchi N. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). HUVEC proliferation was increased as a result of the administration of GnT-VΔ73 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). The utilized concentration appears to be within the physiological range. The concentration of GnT-V in conditioned medium from the GnT-V transfectants was determined to be 140 ng/ml on the basis of the specific activity of GnT-VΔ73. Furthermore, conditioned medium from B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells, which have a high endogenous GnT-V activity, contained ∼70 ng/ml GnT-V. B16-F10 cells also showed an angiogenic activity similar to the GnT-V transfectants in the CAM assay (data not shown), suggesting that the GnT-V secreted from B16-F10 cells can stimulate angiogenesis in this assay system. In addition, the administration of recombinant α1,6-fucosyltransferase indicated the absence of any HUVEC growth-stimulating activity (data not shown). These data indicate that a secreted type of GnT-V within the physiological concentration range has growth-stimulating activity for HUVEC. To determine which domain of GnT-V contains the HUVEC growth-stimulating activity, we analyzed several types of deletion mutants of GnT-V (Fig. 2, B and C). GnTVΔ73, Δ188, and Δ233 mutants stimulated HUVEC proliferation, whereas Δ436 did not (Fig. 2 D). GnT-VΔ73 and Δ188 have GlcNAc transferase activity, but Δ233 and Δ436 do not. These data indicate that the HUVEC growth-stimulating activity is located in the region corresponding to amino acids 234–436 of GnT-V, which does not encompass glycosyltransferase activity. There is a markedly basic region, corresponding to amino acids 254–269, of human GnT-V, whose sequence, KSLAEKQNLEKRKRKK, is very similar to the sequence of amino acid 142–157 of VEGF189 (21.Hauser S. Weich H.A. Growth Factor. 1993; 9: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). In addition, the context of basic amino acids in this region is conserved in PlGF-2 and heparin binding type epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and serves as a heparin-binding motif (21.Hauser S. Weich H.A. Growth Factor. 1993; 9: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Barillari et al.(19.Barillari G. Albonici L. Franzese O. Modesti A. Liberati F. Barillari P. Ensoli B. Manzari V. Santeusanio G. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1161-1166PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a basic peptide, GRGKRR, derived from the sequence of PlGF-2, induced the growth of endothelial cells by releasing FGF-2 from HSPG on the cell surface and/or extracellular matrix. Therefore, we synthesized a basic peptide, KRKRKK, corresponding to amino acids 264–269 of GnT-V and a nonbasic control peptide, FSGGPL (corresponding to amino acids 291–296 of GnT-V), and examined their effects on the growth of HUVEC. The amount of FGF-2 released from HSPG on HUVEC was measured after various truncated GnT-Vs and synthesized peptides were administrated to a culture medium of HUVEC at 4 °C. GnT-VΔ73 and peptide KRKRKK induced the release of FGF-2, whereas GnT-VΔ436 and peptide FSGGPL had no effect (Fig. 3 B). Both GnT-VΔ188 and Δ233, as well as GnTVΔ73, also induced the release of FGF-2 (data not shown). Similarly, heparin, which is known to release HSPG-binding molecules by competing for their heparin-binding site (31.Biard A. Schubert D. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1988; 85: 2324-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), also induced the release of FGF-2. The phosphorylation of FGF receptors on HUVEC by stimulation of the released FGF-2 was confirmed (data not shown). The peptide KRKRKK promoted the growth of HUVEC to an extent similar to GnT-VΔ73 (Fig. 3 C). This effect was completely suppressed by the co-addition of a neutralizing antibody against FGF-2 (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that the KRKRKK region is sufficient for HUVEC growth-stimulating activity and that the GnT-V protein stimulates angiogenesis by releasing FGF-2 from HSPG on endothelial cells via the action of the basic region of the protein. The induction of angiogenesis was also observed in other in vitro angiogenic assays, such as the capillary-like tube formation (32.Ashoton A.W. Yokota R. John G. Zhao S. Suadicani S.O. Spray D.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35562-35570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and the migration assays (33.Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3271-3279Google Scholar) using HUVEC (data not shown). In order to investigate the angiogenic activity of GnT-V ex vivo, a CAM assay using GnT-VΔ73 protein was performed. GnT-VΔ73 induced angiogenesis of chick microvessels as well as FGF-2 (Fig. 4). Moreover, the KRKRKK peptide even induced a similar angiogenesis, and the induction of angiogenesis by GnT-VΔ73 and peptide KRKRKK was inhibited by treatment with a neutralizing antibody against FGF-2. In contrast, neither GnTVΔ436 nor the control peptide had any angiogenic activity. These results indicate that a secreted type of GnT-V and GnT-V-derived peptide KRKRKK induce angiogenesis via the action of FGF-2. Considering the results relative to HUVEC proliferation, the basic region of GnT-V may cause the release of FGF-2 from HSPG on endothelial cells. Angiogenesis is one of the key regulatory steps necessary for tumor malignancy. Several endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis have been identified, and the net balance of these regulators represents the angiogenic phenotype of tumor cells. These include several types of molecules, the functions of which were originally thought to be related to events other than angiogenesis. For instance, angiostatin and endostatin are produced by the proteolysis from plasminogen and type XVIII collagen, respectively (34.O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M.

In the present study, we found that a secreted type of GnT-V protein induces angiogenesis that is unrelated to the usual glycosyltransferase activity of GnT-V. Although a variety of previous studies indicate that GnT-V is directly linked to tumor metastasis, the mechanistic details of its action at the molecular level remain unknown (6.Petretti T. Kemmner W. Schulze B. Schlag P.M. Gut. 2000; 46: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 7.Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Coppolino M. Dedhal S. Dennis J.W. J.

Dennis's group reported that oligosaccharide structures that are modified by GnT-V on an integrin or T cell receptor affect cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix interactions in the processes of tumor metastasis and the immune system (7.Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Coppolino M. Dedhal S. Dennis J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 36.Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The present study proposes a new mechanism of GnT-V-related tumor metastasis, which is not mediated by glycosylation. Namely, it appears that GnT-V is capable of acting as a bifunctional protein. GnT-V is a Golgi enzyme but is also secreted by some cultivated cells (26.Chen L. Zhang N. Adler B. Browne J. Freigen N. Pierce M. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27.Gu J. Nishikawa A. Turuoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The concentration of GnT-V sufficient to induce angiogenesis is within the range of concentration that is actually observed in the conditioned medium of B16-F10 cells. Our hypothesis regarding the action of GnT-V in angiogenesis is schematically summarized in Fig. 5. It is thought that GnT-V secreted from cancer cells releases a deposited FGF-2 from HSPG in the extracellular matrix by competition for binding, and subsequently the released FGF-2 binds to the FGF-2 receptor, forming a ternary complex with the receptor and associated heparan sulfate, and this interaction generates a signal leading to stimulation of angiogenesis. No GnT-V receptor/binding protein on the HUVEC surface was detected by cross-linking analysis using 125I-labeled GnT-V, suggesting that GnT-V does not directly bind to HUVECs but acts indirectly to stimulate signal transduction (data not shown). This hypothesis is supported by the report that when endothelial cells were precultured with VEGF, the addition of a protein containing a basic amino acid cluster like GnT-V induced a release of VEGF from HSPG (19.Barillari G. Albonici L. Franzese O. Modesti A. Liberati F. Barillari P. Ensoli B. Manzari V. Santeusanio G. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1161-1166PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the growth-stimulating effect of GnT-V was also observed in other cell lines, such as breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 (data not shown), which are known to respond to FGF-2 (37.Delehedde M. Deudon E. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,38.Nurcombe V. Smart C.E. Chipperfield H. Cool S.M. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30009-30018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that GnT-V might act as a general growth factor or a differentiation factor via a mechanism similar to that proposed here. The angiogenic potential of GnT-V relates to a basic region that is conserved in the heparin-binding domains of hitherto known angiogenic growth factors. It is noteworthy in this respect that VEGF189 contains the same basic peptide KRKRKK as GnT-V (Fig. 3 A). VEGF189 is known to exist on the cell surfaces as a cell-associated form, distinct from the secretable isoforms of VEGF121 and VEGF165. To associate with a cell surface, the basic region of the C terminus of VEGF189, including the KRKRKK sequence, is required (39.Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that VEGF189 induces the release of FGF-2 from HSPG. In contrast, a secretable factor, PlGF-2, which contains the basic region, induces the release of FGF-2 (19.Barillari G. Albonici L. Franzese O. Modesti A. Liberati F. Barillari P. Ensoli B. Manzari V. Santeusanio G. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1161-1166PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that a secretable factor that contains a basic amino acid cluster might effect a release of a FGF-2 associated with HSPG. Although FGF-2 was identified as a target of the secreted type of GnT-V in this study, other growth factors associated with HSPG also might be released by GnT-V. A considerable body of data has accumulated to date on the involvement of GnT-V in cancer progression (7.Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Coppolino M. Dedhal S. Dennis J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 8.Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Waghorn C. Breitman M.L. Kerbel R.S.

Therefore, inhibiting the action of GnT-V is considered a reasonable strategy against cancer progression. Five mechanisms have been proposed to suppress GnT-V function. First is the inhibition of theN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase enzyme reaction in cancer cells by the administration of a specific inhibitor. Actually, the development of such reagents is ongoing (40.Lu P.P. Hindsgaul O. Compston C.A. Palcic M.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996; 4: 2011-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The second involves the suppression of gene expression of GnT-V. Since Ets-1 is one of the most important transcriptional factors in up-regulating GnT-V gene expression (41.Ko J.H. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Ekuni A. Kang R. Ikeda Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22941-22948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), Ets-1 may be a target for suppressing GnT-V expression. The third is to inhibit the secretion of GnT-V in cancer cells, although the secretion mechanism remains to be solved. The fourth is to mask the basic domain of GnT-V with some reactive acidic reagents. The fifth is the enhancement of the degradation of the secreted GnT-V by proteolysis. First, the issue of whether GnT-V contributes to cancer progression as a glycosyltransferase or an angiogenic factor needs to be determined in individual cancer cases. A specific inhibitor for the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase reaction may solve this problem. In conclusion, we report on a novel mechanism in which a secreted type of GnT-V protein itself plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis, acting as an angiogenic cofactor of FGF-2.

At the same time, NO is also an inducer of stress signaling, owing to its ability to damage proteins and DNA. NO was reported to be a potent activator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. However, the mechanisms underlying p53 activation by NO remain to be elucidated.

In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, NO elicits a down-regulation of Mdm2 protein levels that precedes the rise in p53. NO-induced down-regulation of Mdm2 protein but not its mRNA also occurs in several p53-deficient cell types and is thus p53-independent. The drop in endogenous Mdm2 levels following NO treatment is accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the rate of p53 ubiquitination.

It is now appreciated that p53 is a pivotal integrator of stress signaling, and that many diverse types of stress can evoke a p53 response (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar, 2Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2709) Google Scholar). p53 is typically a very short-lived protein under normal conditions because of its fast proteasomal degradation. A key feature of the p53 response is p53 stabilization, leading to a rapid increase in p53 steady-state levels. Abundant evidence indicates that p53 stabilization largely relies on post-translational events that uncouple p53 from its proteasomal degradation (3Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 4Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A major E31 ubiquitin ligase for p53, whose activity serves as a rate-limiting factor for p53 degradation, is Mdm2 (5Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3719) Google Scholar, 6Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar, 7Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of the mdm2 gene is regulated by p53 itself (8Wu X.W. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 9Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). This p53-Mdm2 autoregulatory feedback loop has been a focus of research in recent years, leading to the realization that many stress signals impinge on this loop to modulate the physical and functional interplay between p53 and Mdm2. Different types of stress engage different mechanisms to uncouple the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop (10Ashcroft M. Taya Y. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In the case of ionizing radiation, the ATM kinase is essential for the rapid accumulation of p53. Ionizing radiation gives rise to at least three ATM-dependent events that impact on the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop, i.e. the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 and Mdm2 on Ser-395 by ATM itself (11Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 12Canman C.E.

In the case of aberrant oncogene expression, oncogenes such as c-Myc, Ras, and β-catenin induce the expression of ARF, which binds to Mdm2 and inhibits its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (16Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 17Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 18Lowe S.W.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4912-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding of ARF to Mdm2 can sequester Mdm2 in the nucleolus (20Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 21Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Both of these mechanisms are proposed to reduce p53 ubiquitination and thereby increase its stability. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important bioactive molecule involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. This membrane permeable and extremely short-lived (biological half-life: 1–10 s) molecule has been shown to be a regulator of cell killing by macrophages, a mediator of vasodilation and a neurotransmitter. Virtually every type of mammalian cell is under the influence of NO (22Schmidt H.H. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar), because it is widely and actively synthesized. NO can be formed either by specific nitric-oxide synthases, which metabolize arginine to citrulline with the formation of NO or by nonenzymatic mechanisms involving the reduction of nitrite to NO under acidic and highly reduced conditions (reviewed in Ref. 23Zweier J.L. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). NO can be stored in the form of S-nitrosothiols. In fact, S-nitrosothiols formed upon the reaction of NO with redox-activated thiols represent an active storage pool for NO (reviewed in Ref. 24Gaston B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The ability of NO to induce p53 accumulation has been observed in several studies. p53 accumulation was shown to occur upon treatment with exogenous NO donors in primary normal human fibroblasts, the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line U937, and the human glioblastoma cell line A172 (25Messmer U.K. Ankarcrona M.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of p53 by NO have not been elucidated. We now report that NO signaling to p53 is independent of ATM, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), or ARF. Of note, the induction of p53 by NO is preceded by a decrease in Mdm2 protein levels. This down-regulation of Mdm2 may be one of the events that contribute to p53 activation by NO. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from day 13.5 embryos and propagated at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 60 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma). MEFs were typically used after four passages in culture. AG03057 (ATM +/−, wtp53, mother) and AG03058 (ATM−/−, wtp53, daughter) cells were obtained from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ). AG03057 and AG03058 and WI-38 cells (human fetal lung fibroblasts, wtp53) were maintained in minimum Eagle’s medium supplemented with 20% non-heat-inactivated FBS. ARF knock-out MEFs were obtained from Dr. C. Sherr. p53-null mouse fibroblasts (line 35-8) were from Dr. G. Lozano. C3 cells (ATM +/− human lymphocytes immortalized by Epstein-Barr Virus) were obtained from Dr. Y. Shiloh. PARP knock-out 3T3 cells and ARF-null and p53-null mouse fibroblasts as well as U2-OS cells (human osteosarcoma, wtp53) were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. ML-1 (human leukemic cells, wtp53), H1299 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma, p53-null), and C3 cells were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells in which the p53 gene has been eliminated by somatic knock-out (28Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W.

Vogelstein and maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 10% FBS. s-Nitroso-n-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) (Sigma) and S-nitroso-glutathione (GSNO) (Alexis Biochemicals) were dissolved in PBS−/− at a concentration of 50 mm and stored at −80 °C in small aliquots. C-PTIO (Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc.) was dissolved in PBS−/− at 10 mm, stored at −80 °C, and used at a final concentration of 10 μm. MG132 (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 50 mm and used at a final concentration of 25 μm. Cycloheximide (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS−/− at 10 mg/ml and used at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. High titer retroviral stocks were produced by transfecting retroviral constructs pBabe-puro or pBabe-PARP into 293T cells (2 × 106/10-cm dish) by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method together with the ecotropic packaging vector pSV-ψE-MLV, providing ecotropic packaging helper function. Virus-containing culture supernatants were collected 24–72 h post-transfection at 6-h intervals and pooled together. PARP knock-out 3T3 cells (2 × 105/10-cm dish) were infected with filtered supernatants. Fresh supernatants were added three times at 4-h intervals. 48 h post-infection, cells were trypsinized and replated for experiments. HCT116 cells were plated at 0.5 × 106/6-cm plate and transfected with the aid of the JetPEI reagent (PolyPlus Transfection) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfection efficiencies were typically above 70%. GSNO treatment was performed 18 h after transfection. Total RNA was extracted using the ULTRASPEC (Biotex Laboratories) reagent. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed as described previously (29Israeli D. Tessler E. Haupt Y. Elkeles A. Wilder S. Amson R. Telerman A. Oren M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4384-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) using the following primer combinations: hp53, 5′-TGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTC-3′ and 5′-TCCGTCCCAGTAGATTACCA-3′; hp21, 5′-CGCGACTGTGATGCGCTAATG-3′ and 5′-GGAACCTCTCATTCAACCGCC-3′; HDM2, 5′-GTGCAATACCAACATGTCTG-3′ and 5′-GCATCAAGATCCGGATTCGA-3′; Mdm2, 5′-CGACTATTCCCAACCATCG-3′ and 5′-CTAGTTGAAGTAACTTAGCACAAT-3′; and GAPDH, 5′-CAGCAATGCATCCTGCACC-3′ and 5′-TGGACTGTGGTCATGAGCCC-3′. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer. After three rounds of vigorous vortexing at 5-min intervals, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min. Aliquots containing 20 μg of total protein (Bio-Rad protein assay) were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BA83, Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were probed with the antibodies indicated in the corresponding figure legends and developed with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). To test the generality of the p53 response to NO, several different cell types were exposed to NO donors (either SNAP or GSNO), and p53 protein levels were monitored by Western blot analysis. A significant induction of endogenous p53 was seen in all wild type p53-containing cell types tested including the U2-OS human osteosarcoma cell line (Fig.1A), the ML-1 human myeloid leukemia cell line (Fig. 1B), WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts (Fig. 1C), and MEFs (Fig. 3). The accumulation of p53 was time-dependent (Fig. 1A) and NO donor concentration-dependent (Fig. 1B) and was seen with both SNAP (Fig. 1, A and B) and GSNO (Fig.1C). Importantly, the addition of a NO scavenger, C-PTIO (10 μm), completely abolished the GSNO-induced increase in p53 but not the induction of p53 by ionizing radiation (Fig.1C, lower panel), confirming that the effect of GSNO on p53 is indeed mediated specifically by NO. Hence, in agreement with earlier reports (25Messmer U.K. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Brune B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 26Forrester K. Ambs S. Lupold S.E.

At that point, cycloheximide (CHX) was added to all cultures to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Extracts were prepared at the indicated time points thereafter and subjected to Western blot analysis with a mixture of the p53-specific monoclonal antibodies PAb421 and PAb248. Vinculin was used as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The accumulation of p53 in response to NO was accompanied by induction of the p53 target genes p21/Waf1 (Fig.2A) and hdm2 (Fig.2B) observed at both protein and mRNA levels. Hence, as reported previously (31Nakaya N. Lowe S.W. Taya Y. Chenchik A. Enikolopov G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6369-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the p53 protein induced by NO is transcriptionally active. The increase in p53 protein in response to NO might be because of either increased levels of p53 mRNA or translational and post-translational events. However, no changes in the concentration of p53 mRNA could be found when p53-specific RT-PCR analysis was performed with the samples used in Fig. 2 (data not shown). Hence, we asked whether the accumulation of p53 was attributed to increased protein stability. To that end, a cycloheximide chase experiment was performed with MEFs maintained either in the presence or absence of the NO donor GSNO. As shown in Fig. 3, exposure to GSNO elicited a significant prolongation of the half-life of p53. An analysis by quantitative densitometry revealed that whereas the half-life of p53 in untreated MEFs was ∼15 min, it increased to 140 min in GSNO-treated cells (data not shown). Thus, NO can indeed reduce the rate of p53 degradation and cause p53 protein stabilization; this is in line with the observations of Ho et al. (30Ho Y.S. Wang Y.J. Lin J.K. Mol. Carcinogen. 1996; 16: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) using cancer cell lines. NO can modify proteins by nitrosylation or nitration as well as cause DNA strand breaks (32Burney S. Caulfield J.L. Niles J.C. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 33Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Nudelman R. Stamler J.S. Nat.

The ATM kinase plays a pivotal role in the induction of p53 by agents such as ionizing radiation, which cause double strand DNA breaks (34Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 35Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that NO may lead to p53 accumulation through induction of double strand breaks and consequent activation of ATM. This notion was addressed by comparing the ability of NO to cause p53 accumulation in cells with different ATM status. As shown in Fig.4A, NO induced p53 to comparable levels in fibroblasts retaining a functional allele of theATM gene (ATM +/−) and in their counterparts lacking completely ATM function (ATM−/−). As expected and unlike the case for NO, the induction of p53 by ionizing radiation was severely impaired in these ATM-null cells (data not shown). It is of note that basal p53 levels were moderately constitutively elevated in the ATM-null cells (Fig. 4A). Hence, ATM activity is dispensable for the activation of p53 by NO. This conclusion was also confirmed by monitoring the reactivity of Mdm2 with the monoclonal antibody 2A10. Phosphorylation of Mdm2 by ATM leads to a substantial drop in 2A10 reactivity (13Maya R. Balass M. Kim S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M.

A. 1999; 96: 14973-14977Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, exposure of cells to NO did not cause any measurable change in the reactivity of Mdm2 with 2A10 (data not shown), arguing that NO does not trigger ATM activation. An attractive candidate for mediating the activation of p53 by NO is the enzyme PARP-1. NO is a potent activator of PARP-1 through its ability to cause single strand DNA breaks (37Radons J. Heller B. Burkle A. Hartmann B. Rodriguez M.L. Kroncke K.D. Burkart V. Kolb H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1270-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 38Pieper A.A. Verma A. Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PARP-1 can engage in direct protein-protein interactions with p53 (39Malanga M. Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11839-11843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the induction of p53 by NO in 3T3 fibroblasts from PARP-1 knock-out mice (40Oliver F.J. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R. Muller S. de la Rubia G. Stoclet J.C. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4446-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and in derivatives of these 3T3 fibroblasts in which PARP-1 expression had been reconstituted by infection with a PARP-1 retrovirus. As shown in Fig. 4B, there was no measurable difference between these two cell types with regard to either p53 protein accumulation or induction of Mdm2, a product of a p53 target gene. Thus, PARP-1 appears dispensable for the activation of p53 by NO. Some signaling pathways, in particular oncogenic stress, lead to p53 stabilization by triggering the synthesis of the ARF tumor suppressor protein (17Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The binding of ARF to Mdm2 inactivates the latter and renders p53 more stable. Therefore, it was of interest to find out whether ARF played a role in the signaling from NO to p53. To that end, the effect of NO on p53 was studied in MEFs from ARF-null mice and in their wild type counterparts. As seen in Fig. 4C, the ablation of ARF expression did not compromise the ability of NO to promote an increase in the steady-state levels of p53 and Mdm2, implying that ARF is not required for the activation of p53 by NO. Because the degradation of p53 is largely dependent on the activity of Mdm2, we performed a more detailed time course analysis of p53 and Mdm2 in wild type MEFs exposed to NO donors. Unexpectedly, although extended exposure to NO augmented the levels of Mdm2 owing to the activation of themdm2 gene by p53 (see Fig. 4C), an opposite picture was revealed at early phases of the NO response. As seen in Fig. 5A, exposure of MEFs to GSNO led to a rapid drop in Mdm2 protein, clearly preceding the rise in p53. As expected, Mdm2 levels increased again and became further augmented at later time points, subsequent to the induction of p53 as also seen in Fig. 2B. The ability of NO to modulate the levels of Mdm2 was further explored in p53-null cells where the analysis is made simpler by the absence of a later Mdm2 induction attributed to p53 activation. Indeed, incubation of p53-deficient H1299 human lung adenocarcinoma cells with GSNO resulted in a substantial and extended drop in Hdm2 (Fig.5B). Consistent with the absence of p53, a second wave of Hdm2 induction did not occur in these cells. A pronounced decrease in Mdm2 quantified with the aid of two different monoclonal antibodies was also evident in GSNO-treated p53-null MEFs (Fig. 5C,left-hand panel). This decrease was not the result of down-modulation of mdm2 mRNA, because semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis did not reveal any significant change in the concentration of the corresponding transcripts (Fig. 5C,right-hand panel). Together, these observations support the notion that the induction of p53 by NO, at least in the early phase of the response, is achieved through down-regulation of Mdm2 protein levels. Mdm2 promotes p53 degradation by driving p53 ubiquitination. Therefore, it appeared plausible that the stabilization of p53 by NO is attributed to reduced p53 ubiquitination as a result of the drop in total Mdm2 levels. This observation was investigated in p53-deficient human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells (28Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). First, to confirm that the effect of NO could also be exerted on exogenous p53, these cells were transfected with a very small amount of p53 expression plasmid. As seen in Fig. 6A, NO indeed augmented the accumulation of the transfected p53 protein along with a reduction in the levels of endogenous Hdm2 protein. However, the total amounts of p53 produced in these transfected cultures were too low to allow further analysis of p53 ubiquitination. Therefore, a similar experiment was performed using higher inputs of p53 expression plasmid DNA. An analysis of relatively small aliquots of the resultant cell extracts revealed again the expected drop in Hdm2 (Fig. 6B,right-hand panel). However, this time there was no significant increase in p53, presumably because the transfected p53 was in large excess over endogenous Hdm2. These conditions simplified the quantitative analysis of p53 ubiquitination, because no adjustment had to be made for differences in total p53 protein. Importantly, when larger amounts of the same extracts were subjected to analysis with p53-specific antibodies, a significant reduction was observed in the intensity of the bands corresponding to ubiquitinated forms of p53 (Fig. 6B, left-hand panel). A similar picture was seen when HCT116 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for p53 and hemagglutinin-ubiquitin followed by analysis of p53-ubiquitin conjugates (data not shown). Hence, the NO-induced drop in total Mdm2 protein is accompanied by a corresponding drop in p53 ubiquitination, which presumably underlies the subsequent stabilization of p53. The mechanisms underlying the stress-induced stabilization and activation of p53 are being extensively studied (3Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 4Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp.

Although the ability of NO to up-regulate p53 is well documented, the detailed molecular analysis of the underlying mechanisms is complicated by the fact that NO is a very pleiotropic agent, which can cause several different types of protein modifications, lipid oxidation, and DNA strand breaks. NO causes DNA damage through its derivatives dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3 = NO + NO2−) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−). The resultant types of DNA damage include cross-linking, formation of abasic sites, and single strand breaks (reviewed in Ref. 32Burney S. Caulfield J.L. Niles J.C. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The utilization of cells bearing deficiencies in several DNA damage-induced pathways enabled us to rule out some of those pathways as key mediators of the activation of p53 by NO. Thus, ATM was found to be dispensable for such activation, arguing against a major role of double-stranded DNA breaks. A more probable candidate was PARP-1, because this enzyme can be strongly activated by NO and because it has been implicated by several studies in the DNA damage-induced p53 response (43Whitacre C.M. Hashimoto H. Tsai M.L. Chatterjee S. Berger S.J. Berger N.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3697-3701PubMed Google Scholar, 44Wang X. Ohnishi K. Takahashi A. Ohnishi T.

Cell Mol. Biol. Lett. 2001; 6: 117-140PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PARP-1 coimmunoprecipitates with p53 and can bind noncovalently to three different regions of p53 (residues 153–178, 231–253, and 326–348), one of which is adjacent to the p53 nuclear export signal (39Malanga M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The binding of PARP-1 to the p53 region adjacent to its nuclear export signal raises the interesting possibility that PARP-1 might increase the nuclear retention of p53 and thereby stabilize it. However, our findings do not support a role for PARP-1 in NO signaling to p53. Nevertheless, we can not rule out the possibility that the recently described PARP-2 protein (49Ame J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) as well as other DNA damage-induced signaling events may play a role in p53 activation by NO. Similarly, our findings also appear to exclude ARF as a major contributor to NO-induced p53 accumulation. This sets NO clearly apart from oncogenic stress, which utilizes ARF to neutralize Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation (17Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Rather, our data suggest that a biphasic mechanism is responsible for the up-regulation of p53 by NO. In the first phase, typically occurring within a few hours after exposure, NO leads to a pronounced decrease in Mdm2 protein levels. This is followed by a drop in p53 ubiquitination, leading to an initial rise in p53 protein. It is conceivable that the lower levels of Mdm2 also enable p53 to escape more efficiently the inhibitory effects because of the masking of its transactivation domain by the bound Mdm2. As a consequence, the accumulated p53 is likely to be more active as a transcription factor. In the second phase, Mdm2 levels rise again as a result of the transactivation of themdm2 gene by the activated p53. This phase presumably occurs only if the high levels of NO persist beyond the first few hours. At present, our findings do not explain the ability of p53 to persist at elevated levels despite this surge in Mdm2 expression. However, as is the case in other stress conditions, it is conceivable that this persistence is at least in part the result of multiple covalent modifications on both p53 and Mdm2 (3Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 4Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp.

Of note, it has been reported that NO elicits a specific pattern of p53 phosphorylation events that is distinct from that known to occur in response to other stress signals (31Nakaya N. Lowe S.W. Taya Y. Chenchik A. Enikolopov G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6369-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Such phosphorylation might underlie, at least to some extent, the resistance of p53 to Mdm2 after long exposure to NO. Down-regulation of Mdm2 has been observed in a number of other situations that give rise to p53 activation including UV radiation and several DNA-damaging cancer therapy agents, as well as hypoxia (10Ashcroft M. Taya Y. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar,50Wu L. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 441-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Ma Y. Yuan R.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6046-6051PubMed Google Scholar). With UV and other DNA-damaging agents, the ablation of Mdm2 was found to be largely the result of down-regulation ofmdm2 gene expression. As shown here, this is not the case for NO, because no change in the abundance of mdm2transcripts could be observed at a time when Mdm2 protein levels were markedly reduced. In contrast, the mechanism underlying the down-modulation of Mdm2 by hypoxia (52Alarcon R. Koumenis C. Geyer R.K. Maki C.G. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6046-6051PubMed Google Scholar) could be more similar to that employed by NO, particularly because hypoxia can up-regulate cellular NO levels through induction of iNOS expression (53Melillo G. Musso T. Sica A. Taylor L.S. Cox G.W. Varesio L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1683-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 54Melillo G. Taylor L.S. Brooks A. Musso T. Cox G.W. Varesio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12236-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In that regard, it is of note that p53 has been shown to be a negative regulator of iNOS expression (26Forrester K. Ambs S. Lupold S.E. Kapust R.B. Spillare E.A. Weinberg W.C. Felley-Bosco E. Wang X.W. Geller D.A. Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2442-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Thus, iNOS appears to be part of a negative autoregulatory feedback loop, which on one hand the NO generated by iNOS drives p53 activation, whereas on the other hand this activated p53 down-regulates iNOS expression and thereby restrains further NO production (26Forrester K. Ambs S. Lupold S.E. Kapust R.B. Spillare E.A. Weinberg W.C. Felley-Bosco E. Wang X.W. Geller D.A. Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2442-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar).

A module can be subdivided into domains, each representing the single enzymatic activity necessary for synthesis and modification of the peptide chain. The adenylation (A) domain is responsible for substrate recognition and activation as aminoacyladenylate at the expense of ATP (6.Turgay K. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Mol.

The downstream PCP domains are the sites of intermediate binding and serve as carrier units (8.Stachelhaus T. Huser A. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 913-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The peptide bond formation between covalently bound intermediates on two consecutive modules is catalyzed by a condensation (C) domain (9.Schwarzer D.

During this peptide assembly, optional modifications of the substrates can occur, depending on the presence of modifying domains within the corresponding module. For example, epimerization (E) domains catalyze the conversion of incorporated l-amino acids to their d-isomers (2.Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). NRPSs, FASs, and PKSs contain one or more small PCP or ACP domains that are 80–100 amino acids in length that carry the building blocks and elongated intermediates to the different catalytic centers. Depending on the architecture of the multienzyme complex, these carrier proteins appear as integrated domains or as individual proteins. The PCP domains in NRPSs and the acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) in FASs and PKSs share a conserved sequence motif (GX(D/H)S(L/I)(D/K)) containing an invariable serine residue (11.De Crecy-Lagard V. Marliere P. Saurin W. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1995; 318: 927-936PubMed Google Scholar). During posttranslational modification the 4′-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) co-factor is transferred from coenzyme A and attached to this serine residue converting the carrier proteins from the inactive apo form to the activeholo form (4.Lambalot R.H.

Dedicated 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) catalyze the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl side chain of the conserved carrier protein serine residue onto the 5′-β-pyrophosphate linkage of coenzyme A (CoASH) in a magnesium ion dependent reaction (4.Lambalot R.H.

During peptide or polyketide synthesis, the activated substrates and elongation intermediates are covalently linked as thioesters to the thiol moiety of the 4′-Ppant. PPTases have been classified into two types based on substrate specificity: the AcpS type of primary metabolism and the Sfp type of secondary metabolism (4.Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 12.Reuter K. Mofid M.R. Marahiel M.A. Ficner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6823-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). PPTases of the AcpS type are about 120 amino acids in length and have a pI value of about 9.6; they are found in almost every known microorganism and are responsible for the modification of fatty acid ACPs. Biochemical studies demonstrated that ACPs of type II PKS systems, the d-alanyl carrier protein from Lactobacillus casei involved ind-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid (13.Debabov D.V. Heaton M.P. Zhang Q. Stewart K.D. Lambalot R.H. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3869-3876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NodF fromRhizobia involved in the acylation of the oligosaccharide-based nodulation factors could be modified by AcpS fromEscherichia coli (14.Ritsema T. Geiger O. van Dillewijn P. Lugtenberg B.J.J. Spaink H.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7740-7743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), too. The PPTase Sfp of Bacillus subtilis represents the prototype of the second group of PPTases. Enzymes of this class are about 240 amino acids in length with a pI value of about 6 and have mostly been found associated with NRPS gene clusters (15.Nakano M.M. Corbell N. Besson J. Zuber P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The well characterized Sfp exhibits an extraordinarily broad substrate specificity and is able to modify all carrier proteins so far tested including PCPs of NRPSs and ACPs of both FASs and PKSs (16.Mofid M.R. Marahiel M.A. Ficner R. Reuter K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1098-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of B. subtilis AcpS co-crystallized with CoA and ACP gave detailed insight into the interactions between this enzyme and its substrates (17.Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Mathew R. Hixon J. Stahl M. Fritz C.C. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 883-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It was possible to identify those residues of ACP that are responsible for the protein interaction with AcpS, most of which are provided by helix 3 of the ACP. The solution structure of a prototype PCP domain showed that PCPs fold into a secondary structure similar to that of ACPs (18.Weber T. Baumgartner R. Renner C. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 407-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this study, we present the construction of hybrid PCP/ACP carrier proteins through the replacement of the coding region for helix 2 in the TycC3-PCP with the corresponding region of ACP from B. subtilis as well as the replacement of this PCP helix in the domain of the initiation module TycA of the tyrocidine synthetase. Both hybrid proteins were biochemically characterized in modification assays with the PPTases AcpS and Sfp from B. subtilis. Using the newly created PCP domain within the NRPS module hTycA, we also show that hPCP is able to perform the necessary communication with the A and C domains. E. coli was grown on LB medium with 10 mmMgCl2. The following antibiotics were used: 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. For E. coli techniques, such as transformation and plasmid preparation, standard protocols were used (19.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The Herculase™ Hotstart polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to amplify gene fragments for cloning and expression purposes. Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech. [3H]CoA and [14C]Phe were purchased from Hartmann Analytics (Braunschweig, Germany). The plasmid pQE70-TycC3-PCP (18.Weber T. Baumgartner R. Renner C. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 407-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar) served as a template in a PCR with oligonucleotides carrying the sequence information for helix 2 (italic) of ACP from B. subtilis including a SacI restriction site (underlined) and the sequence from TycC3-PCP (bold): 5′-ATA GAGCTC GTTATGGAACTTGAAGAC GAGTATCAGGTTGAGCTTCC-3′ and 5′-ATA GAGCTC AACTACATCTAGGGAATC TCCGCCGATCTGGAAAAAGT-3′ to amplify a fragment that contained hPCP, under control of the T5 promotor of pQE70. This fragment was treated with SacI, the template DNA was digested withDpnI, and the PCR product was subsequently religated to pQE70-hPCP (3664 bp) (Fig. 3). The plasmid pTycA (20.Mootz H.D. Schwarzer D. Marahiel M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5848-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) served as a template in a PCR with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TTTA ACTAGT TATGGAACTTGAAGAC TATCAATTGAAGCTAGAGACGAAAGAC-3′ and 5′-ATAT ACTAGT TCAACTACATCTAGCGAATC TCCGCCGAGCGAG-3′ to amplify a fragment that contained hTycA. This fragment was treated with SpeI, the template DNA was digested with DpnI, and the PCR product was subsequently religated to pQE60-hTycA (6686 bp). E. coli M15, which carries the plasmid pREP4 providing the lacI gene for efficient repression of transcription, was transformed with the described plasmids. The proteins were overproduced as previously described (10.Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration) at an A 600 of 0.6, and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 2 h before being harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 × g at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.8) and disrupted by three passages through a cooled French pressure cell. The resulting cell extract was centrifuged at 36,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min. Protein purification using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography was carried out as previously described. Purified protein was dialyzed against the respective assay buffer, brought to 10% glycerol (v/v), and stored at −80 °C. TycC3-PCP (hereafter referred to as PCP), TycA, TycB1, AcpS form B. subtilis, and Sfp-His6 were produced and purified as previously described (10.Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined based on the calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm: PCP, 9,530m−1 cm−1; hPCP, 9,530m−1 cm−1; and hTycA-His6, 133,580 m−1cm−1. Priming of heterologously expressed proteins was achieved by incubation of 1 μm apo-enzyme with 100 μm CoASH and 25 nm recombinant B. subtilis Ppant transferase Sfp or AcpS for 30 min at 37 °C (16.Mofid M.R. Marahiel M.A. Ficner R. Reuter K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1098-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,21.Mootz H.D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) prior to the addition of any amino acid. AcpS and Sfp activity was assayed by using a radioactive assay method essentially as described previously (22.Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). This method measures the incorporation of the 3H-labeled 4′-phosphopantetheine group from [3H]CoA into apo-enzymes. Reaction mixtures containing 75 mm MES/HCl, pH 6.0 (in the case of AcpS 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 μm of the respective protein, 20 μm CoA, 200 nm [3H]CoA (specific activity, 40 Ci/mmol, 0.95 mCi/ml), and 2.2–5.6 nm AcpS of B. subtilis or 25 nm Sfp were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.8 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloracetic acid (w/v) and 15 μl of bovine serum albumin (25 mg/ml). Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C for 15 min using a microcentrifuge. The pellet was washed twice with 0.8 ml of ice-cold trichloracetic acid (w/v) and resuspended in 180 μl of formic acid. The resulting suspension was mixed with 3.5 ml of Rotiszint Eco Plus scintillation fluid (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and counted using a 1900CA Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard, Dreieich, Germany). For kinetic studies, the amount of holo-carrier protein formed was determined by an HPLC method. 800-μl reaction mixtures containing, 1–125 μm apo-PCP or 5–135 μm apo-hPCP, 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.8 (75 mm MES/HCl, pH 6.0, in the case of Sfp) 12.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm CoA and 11.2 nm AcpS of B. subtilis or 10 nm Sfp were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped, and the protein was precipitated by the addition of 10% trichloracetic acid. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was subsequently resuspended in 120 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8. A 100-μl sample of this solution was injected onto a reversed phase HPLC column (Nucleosil C18, 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å, Macherey and Nagel) equilibrated with 60% solvent A (H2O with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in the case of PCP.apo- and holo-PCP could be separated by applying a 15-ml linear gradient 40–95% solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min; temperature, 40 °C). The samples were examined for their A 220. Under these conditions, the holo-carrier protein migrates faster than the apo form (retention times were 10.67 and 11.95 min, respectively). The amount of holo-PCP formed was determined by comparing the peak area of the holo-PCP formed with those of both apo- and holo-PCP and subtracting the amount of holo-PCP that was already present after the heterologous expression of the protein in E. coli (see “Results”). In the case of hPCP, a 1.2-ml linear gradient to 50% solvent C (methanol with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for 25 min (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min; temperature, 40 °C) followed by a 7.2-ml linear gradient to 90% solvent C at 0.3 ml/min and 40 °C, holo- and apo-hPCP eluted at the respective retention times 26.1 and 27.7 min. The incorporation of [3H]phosphopantetheine was performed as described previously (22.Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8 (in the case of Sfp 75 mm MES/HCl pH 6.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm CoA, 200 nm [3H]CoA (specific activity, 40 Ci/mmol and 0.95 mCi/ml), 25 nm ACPS or Sfp, and 1 μm apo-TycA or -hTycA. The reactions were started by the addition of the PPTase and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were quenched with 800 μl of 10% trichloracetic acid (w/v) and 15 μl of 25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 30 min in a microcentrifuge), washed twice with 1 ml of 10% trichloracetic acid (w/v), and subsequently solubilized in 180 μl of concentrated formic acid. The redissolved protein was mixed with 3.5 ml of Rotiszint Eco Plus scintillation fluid (Roth), and the amount of radioactivity incorporated was quantified using a 1900CA Tri-Carb liquid scintillation (Packard). To investigate the interaction between the A domain and the PCP of TycA and hTycA, both modules were covalently loaded withl- or d-[14C]Phe. Aminoacylation was performed as described previously (10.Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 23.Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol.1. 1997; 179: 6843-6850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetases were aminoacylated in reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing assay buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP), 1 μm holo-TycA or holo-hTycA, and 2 μml-[14C]Phe (450 mCi/mmol) or 2 μmd-[14C]Phe (56 mCi/mmol). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for specific times, and samples were taken and quenched with 0.8 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloracetic acid (w/v) and 15 μl of a 25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 30 min in a microcentrifuge), washed twice with 1 ml 10% trichloracetic acid (w/v), and solubilized in 180 μl of concentrated formic acid. The redissolved protein was mixed with 3.5 ml of liquid scintillation fluid, and the amount of incorporated radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation analysis (Packard). To investigate the conversion of l-Phe-S-Ppant enzyme to the d-Phe-S-Ppant species (and vice versa), TycA(PheATE) and hTycA(PheATE) were allowed to activate and covalently load l- or d-[14C]Phe (24.Stachelhaus T. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5775-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures in assay buffer containing 1 μm holo-enzyme as well as 8.9 μml-[14C]Phe (450 mCi/mmol) or 71.4 μmd-[14C]Phe (56 mCi/mmol) were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C (final volume, 200 μl). At defined time points, the samples were taken and quenched with 0.8 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloracetic acid (w/v). After 15 min of incubation on ice the precipitate was centrifuged (4 °C, 13,000 rpm, 20 min in a microcentrifuge), and the pellet was washed in succession twice with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloracetic acid, 1 ml of ether/ethanol (3:1 v/v), and 1 ml of ether. The pellet was subsequently dried at 37 °C. The acid-stable thioester [14C]Phe-S-Ppant was hydrolyzed by incubation with 100 μl of 100 mm potassium hydroxide at 75 °C for 15 min. The extraction of the cleaved amino acid was carried out by the addition of 1 ml of methanol and centrifugation at 4 °C at 13,000 rpm for 30 min in a microcentrifuge. Subsequently, the supernatants containing the released [14C]Phe were transferred to fresh tubes, the solvent was removed under vacuum, and the pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of 50% ethanol (v/v) and applied to chiral TLC plates. The plates were developed in acetonitrile/water/methanol (4:1:1 v/v/v) as solvent. The radioactivity was counted with a two-dimensional radio scanner (Raytest) and quantified using the supplied Radioisotope Thin Layer Analyzer software. The autoradiography was utilized to confirm the integrity of both [14C]Phe substrates. These studies revealed an optical purity of > 99% for l-[14C]Phe and 95% for d-[14C]Phe. The identity of released DKP diastereoisomers was established by HPLC analysis using internal standards. Purified holo-TycA or -hTycA was loaded with either l- or d-Phe and mixed with holo-TycB1 that had been loaded withl-Pro beforehand to assay for dipeptidyl-S-Ppant product formation (25.Linne U. Doekel S. Marahiel M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15824-15834Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 200-μl reaction mixtures in assay buffer contained 1 μm enzyme as well as the cognate amino acid (2.5 mml-Pro and 2.5 mml- or d-Phe). Simultaneously, 200 μl of each solution were preincubated at 37 °C to ensure a complete aminoacylation of both modules. After 5 min, the condensation reaction was initiated by combining equal volumes of TycA or hTycA and TycB1, and at various time points 50-μl samples were taken and immediately quenched by the addition of 0.45 ml of 10% trichloracetic acid (w/v). The reaction mixtures were extracted with 0.5 ml of butanol/chloroform (4:1 v/v). The organic solvent was transferred to fresh tubes and subsequently removed under vacuum. The pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of 30% methanol and applied to a reversed-phase HPLC column (GROM-SIL120-ODS-4-HE, C18, 60 × 3 mm inner diameter, 5 μm, from GROM, Herrenberg, Germany) equilibrated with 22.5% methanol.d,l and l,l isoforms of Phe-Pro DKP could be separated by isocratic elution using 25% methanol as solvent (temperature, 23 °C; flow rate, 1 ml/min) over 10 min. In the relevant time frame (5.5 and 6.5 min, respectively), the samples were examined for their absorbance at 214 nm. CD spectra were collected with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter in a 0.1-cm water jacketed cell at 25 °C. The samples were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7. The spectra of the protein (final concentration, 10 μm) were recorded from 260 to 190 nm in continuous mode with a scanning speed of 10 nm/min, a time constant of 2 s, and a bandwidth of 1 nm (26.Flaman A.S. Chen J.M. Van Iderstine S.C. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35934-35939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In some experiments the samples were measured and 0.01 volumes of 1 m MgCl2 were added directly, and the CD spectrum was remeasured after 30 min of incubation time for the analysis of the effect of Mg2+ ion on the secondary structure of carrier proteins. Five spectra of each protein were measured, and after spectral subtraction of a blank sample, quantitative deconvolution of CD spectra was performed by computer using the protein secondary structure estimation program, as described previously (27.Yang J.T. Enzymology. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). The motivation behind this study is the construction of a hybrid acyl carrier protein that can be modified in vitroand in vivo by AcpS and Sfp. We have constructed a distinct hPCP through replacement of the region coding for helix 2 in the TycC3-PCP with the corresponding region of ACP (14 amino acids) fromB. subtilis as a single domain (Fig. 3). Using the same strategy, we subsequently constructed a hTycA through the replacement of the corresponding helix in the PCP of TycA, the initiation module (comprising three domains: A, PCP, and E) of the tyrocidine synthetase. Both hybrid proteins were constructed on the DNA level using oligonucleotides carrying the genetic information encoding helix 2 of ACP of B. subtilis. The structure of AcpS from B. subtilis co-crystallized with CoA and ACP was described previously by Parris et al. (17.Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Mathew R. Hixon J. Stahl M. Fritz C.C. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 883-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It revealed detailed insight into the protein-protein interaction between AcpS and ACP. It was possible to identify those residues of ACP that are mainly responsible for this interaction. Most of them are located in helix 2 of ACP (numbering according to Xu et al. (28.Xu G.Y. Tam A. Lin L. Hixon J. Fritz C.C. Powers R. Structure. 2001; 9: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). ACPs and PCPs have a similar function and secondary structure. The sequence similarity between ACPs and PCPs, however, is very low; it is concentrated in the immediate neighborhood of the invariant serine residue (2.Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 18.Weber T. Baumgartner R. Renner C. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A.

The similarity of the loop between helices 1 and 2 and of the orientation of helix 2 in ACPs is high, whereas sequence similarity between PCPs can only be found in heli"

Several pyrimidine-rich sequences are able to substitute for the natural S4 enhancer with various stimulatory effects. We show that the different enhancer sequences recruit U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (SnRNP) to the exon 6A 5′ splice site, with an efficiency that correlates with the splicing activation. By using RNA affinity and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we characterized several proteins that bind to the different enhancer sequences. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K and hnRNP I (polypyrimidine track-binding protein, PTB) exhibit a higher level of interaction with the strong enhancer sequences (S4) than with the weakest enhancers. Functional analysis shows that hnRNP K is a component of the enhancer complex that promotes exon 6A splicing through the wild-type S4 sequence. The addition of recombinant hnRNP K to nuclear extracts preincubated with poly(rC) RNA competitor completely restores splicing efficiency to the original level. hnRNP I (PTB) was also found associated with the strong enhancer sequences.

Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs generates different mRNAs from the same primary transcript and as such contributes to protein diversity (1.Black D.L.

Genet. 1989; 23: 527-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). This process is thought to be important for regulation of the gene expression and has been enlightened by the discovery that human genome contains only 30,000–40,000 genes. From these studies, it has been suggested that more than 50% of the genes are alternatively spliced (4.Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. Funke R. Gage D. Harris K. Heaford A. Howland J. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17710) Google Scholar). In many cases, alternative splicing is regulated in a tissue developmental stage or sex-specific manner and responds differently to metabolic stimuli (2.Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 3.Smith C.W. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 527-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Studies of different splicing events show that the bona fide regulation is orchestrated by multicomponent complexes that promote or repress the use of alternative splice sites through binding to regulatory sequences (1.Black D.L.

Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The SR protein family is a well characterized class of proteins that are involved in both constitutive and alternative splicing (7.Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Tacke R. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the binding of members of the SR proteins to purine enhancer sequences promotes the inclusion of the corresponding exon by facilitating the recognition of weak 3′ splice sites (9.Hertel K.J. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been found that hnRNP A1 interacts with silencer elements to repress splicing of several pre-mRNAs (14.Chabot B. Blanchette M. Lapierre I. La Branche H. Mol. Cell.

Virol. 2001; 75: 8487-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 tat splicing, it has been proposed that the binding of hnRNP A1 to intron silencer sequences blocks the U2 snRNP interaction (19.Tange T.O. Damgaard C.K. Guth S. Valcarcel J. Kjems J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5748-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). hnRNP I or PTB is also implicated in the negative control of alternative splicing of several pre-mRNAs, including α and β tropomyosin from rat, γ-GABAA receptor γ2, fibroblast growth factor receptors, c-src, and caspase-2 (6.Smith C.W.

RNA. 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In some cases, it has been suggested that PTB mediates repression by interfering with the binding of U2AF65 on the polypyrimidine tract (22.Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 996-1015PubMed Google Scholar). However, in other models in which PTB is implicated, it has been shown that multiple binding sites for PTB are required for the repression, suggesting a more complex role for PTB (28.Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3281-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 30.Chou M.Y. Underwood J.G. Nikolic J. Luu M.H. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Several other hnRNP have been implicated in the tissue-specific regulation of pre-mRNAs. KSRP, an hnRNP that contains KH motifs, has been identified in an intronic enhancer complex (downstream control sequence, DCS) that is required for inclusion of the N1 exon of c-src pre-mRNA (31.Min H. Turck C.W. Nikolic J.M. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In contrast, PSI is another K-H protein that prevents the splicing of theDrosophila P element third intron, through binding to an exonic silencer element (32.Adams M.D. Tarng R.S. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). hnRNP H has been also implicated in the regulation of splicing. Depending on which pre-mRNA it is bound, hnRNP H behaves either as an activator or a repressor of splicing (33.Chou M.Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 34.Chen C.D. Kobayashi R. Helfman D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). From studies of several alternative splicing models, it is clear that splice site selection depends on the intricate combined control of both enhancer and silencer elements. In addition, several of the regulatory sequences are made of individual motifs that have opposite effects on splice site selection, making it difficult to precisely dissect the role of the motifs and the proteins bound to them. This is well exemplified in the case of the N1 exon from c-src pre-mRNA in which PTB binding motifs that participate in the repression of the N1 exon in nonneuronal cells have been found interspersed within the DCS sequence (35.Markovtsov V. Nikolic J.M. Goldman J.A. Turck C.W. Chou M.Y. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7463-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypyrimidine track-binding protein downstream control sequence heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypyrimidine track-binding protein downstream control sequence The chicken β-tropomyosin pre-mRNA provides an example of the complexity of alternative splicing regulation. This transcript contains two mutually exclusive exons that are selected in a tissue-specific fashion (36.Libri D. Piseri A. Fiszman M.Y. Science. 1991; 252: 1842-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Exon 6A is recognized in nonmuscle cells and myoblasts, whereas exon 6B is recognized in skeletal muscle and myotubes. This regulation is maintained in vitro with HeLa cell nuclear extracts, where exon 6A is included and exon 6B is excluded (37.Goux-Pelletan M. Libri D. d'Aubenton-Carafa Y. Fiszman M. Brody E. Marie J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recognition of exon 6A requires an intronic enhancer element (S4) lying 37 nt downstream of the exon 6A 5′ splice site (38.Balvay L. Libri D. Gallego M. Fiszman M.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 39.Gallego M.E. Balvay L. Brody E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5415-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enhancer sequence also exerts a negative control on exon 6B recognition by a mechanism that is presently unknown (38.Balvay L. Libri D. Gallego M. Fiszman M.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a sequence derived from the pyrimidine tract upstream of exon 3 of the rat α-tropomyosine (P3S) is able to substitute for S4 and to activate exon 6A recognition (40.Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezancon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We have shown that splicing enhancement by S4 and P3S is mediated through their interaction with ASF/SF2 and that SC35 has an antagonistic effect (40.Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezancon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Another group has identified other pyrimidine-rich sequences that activate exon 6A splicing (41.Pret A.M. Balvay L. Fiszman M.Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). One is located in the intron downstream of exon 5 (PyI5), and the other (S5) lies immediately downstream of S4. The two sequences are able to stimulate the splicing of exon 6A in myoblasts but at a level that is lower than with the P3S and the natural S4 sequences. Based on these results, we reasoned that the activation of exon 6A splicing by the different pyrimidine-rich sequences was mediated either through the interaction of a common set of proteins, whose level of interaction determines the efficiency of stimulation, or by different proteins that operate through the same activation mechanism. Regardless of the mechanism, the analysis of the proteins assembled onto the different enhancer sequences might provide an approach to identify the activating proteins that bind to the natural S4 enhancer. In this paper, we purified the protein complexes that bind to the different enhancer sequences by RNA affinity chromatography. The protein pattern analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis shows that a common set of hnRNPs interacts with the different enhancers, which correlates with splicing activation. hnRNP K and hnRNP I exhibit stronger interaction with the strong enhancers S4 and P3S than with the weaker PyI5 and S5. We show that hnRNP K is involved in the recognition of exon 6A through its interaction with the S4 sequence. Inhibition of exon 6A splicing by competition with poly(rC) is fully relieved by the addition of recombinant hnRNP K. In addition, we show that the activating sequences act through a common mechanism to recruit U1 snRNP to the exon 6A 5′ splice site. Streptavidin-agarose beads were preblocked by adding acetylated bovine serum albumin (500 μg/ml) andEscherichia coli tRNA (100 μg/ml) and rotating 15 min at 4 °C in WB50 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40). Beads were washed once with WB 100 (as WB 50, but with 100 mm NaCl). Biotinylated RNA was added in the same buffer and gently rotated for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected and washed three times in buffer D (12 mm Hepes, pH 8, 60 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 12% glycerol), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −20 °C or used immediately. The efficiency of fixation was routinely above 80% of the 32P-labeled RNA input and was carefully controlled for a strict comparison of the different RNA samples. For analytical gels, 125 or 250 pmol of RNA was fixed to 50 μl of beads and mixed with 1 ml of 30% HeLa nuclear extracts under splicing conditions without polyvinylalcohol by rotating for 5 min at 30 °C. Beads and splicing mixture were separately prewarmed at 30 °C for 5 min before mixing. Beads were collected by centrifugation 1 min at 3000 rpm and washed two times with ice-cold WB 100. About 75% of the RNA was recovered. The equivalent of 60 pmol of RNA was sufficient for analysis by silver staining on a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel. For preparative interactions, RNAs were at 4–4.4 pmol/μl of beads for a total of 500 μl of beads and incubated in 2 ml of 30% HeLa cell nuclear extracts under splicing conditions. The proteins were released from the beads by mixing twice in 66% glacial acetic acid and 33 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 4 °C. 300 μl were used for 60 μl of beads. After centrifugation for 2 min at 3000 rpm, the supernatants were precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone for 16 h at −20 °C, using 40 μg of glycogen as carrier. The proteins were centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The pellets were washed three times with acetone/H2O (5:1) and stored dried at −20 °C or dissolved in 9 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mdithiotreitol, and 2% ampholyne, pH 3.5–9.5, and stored at −20 °C. The first dimension was either an isoelectofocusing (IEF) or a nonequilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis (NEPHGE) as described (42.O'Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar) using ampholyne, pH 3.5–9.5 (Amersham Biosciences) or pH 3–10 (Amersham Biosciences). The second dimension was usually a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (43.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized by silver staining or by Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. For a strict comparison of the protein interactions, the gels were processed together in the same batch, and overstaining was avoided. Proteins analyzed by mass spectrometry were prepared from a scaled-up reaction in which 1000 pmol of RNA bound to streptavidin-agarose were added to 8 ml of prewarmed solution containing 2.4 ml of nuclear extracts under splicing conditions and then treated as indicated above. The proteins were separated on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The protein spots were excised from the gel and digested within the gel with trypsin. Mass spectra were recorded in positive reflector mode with a matrix-assisted laser desorpton-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Voyager Elite, Perseptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) equipped with a delayed extraction device. The proteins were identified by data base searching using Peptide Search and MS Fit. Constructs 6A-7, 6A-P3S-7, 6A-S5-7, 6A-Δ4-7, and 6A-S5-7 were previously described (40.Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezancon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). They retain 199 bp of intronic sequences downstream of exon 6A up to thePmlI restriction site and 90 bp of intronic sequence upstream of exon 7, including the branch point. 6A-PyI5-7 was obtained by the introduction of a double-stranded oligonucleotide into thePstI site of 6A-Δ4-7 (see the sequence in Fig. 1 A). Plasmid 5′-S4 was constructed by PCR from 5-6A-Δ6-6B plasmid, (39.Gallego M.E. Balvay L. Brody E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5415-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a sense primer 5′-GGGAATTCGGAAGAGGTACTGGG-3′ containing an EcoRI site at the 5′-end and an antisense primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGAGAGGTGGCTG-3′ containing a HindIII site. The product of PCR was digested with EcoRI andHindIII and cloned into plasmid pSP65. Plasmids 5′-P3S, 5′-PyI5, and 5′-S5 were derived from plasmid 5′-S4 after digestion byKpnI and HindIII and replacement of the S4 sequence by the corresponding double-stranded oligonucleotides (see sequences in Fig. 2). For S4b and S5b, double-stranded oligonucleotides with an upstream EcoRI and downstream HindIII were cloned into pSP65 (see sequences in Fig. 2). pSma plasmid that contains exon 6B, IVSB7 intron, and exon 7 has been described previously (44.Clouet d'Orval B. d'Aubenton Carafa Y.

RNAs 5′-S4, 5′-S5, 5′-pyI5, and 5′-P3S have in common seven nucleotides from exon 6A, the 5′ splice site of exon 6A, and 15 nucleotides derived from the pSP65 polylinker (shown inboldface type). Restriction sites at the 3′-end of the RNAs are indicated in italic type. Sequence S6, which has no functional effect on 6A splicing, was deleted (38.Balvay L. Libri D. Gallego M. Fiszman M.Y.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Sequences S4b and S5b have in common 15 nucleotides derived from the pSP65 polylinker. Note that S5b contains additional intronic nucleotides (not present in 5′-S5) to have the same length as S4b.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Capped pre-mRNAs were synthesizedin vitro as described previously using [α-32P]UTP and SP6 RNA polymerase (45.Ruskin B. Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 317-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Transcripts were purified on polyacrylamide/urea gels. RNAs used for affinity chromatography and S4b and S5b competitor RNAs were transcribed using a SP6 MEGAshortscript Kit (Ambion), without the cap analogue, and labeled at 10–20 cpm/pmol with [α-32P]UTP to facilitate quantification. RNAs were purified on a microbiospin column (Bio-Rad) and 3′-biotinylated as described (40.Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezancon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Poly(rC) competitor was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. To compare poly(rC) with other competitor RNAs, 20 ng of poly(rC) was taken as the equivalent of 1 pmol of a 65-nucleotide-long RNA. Splicing reactions were performed as described with 25 pmol of labeled pre-mRNA in 12.5-μl reactions with 40% HeLa nuclear extract (39.Gallego M.E. Balvay L. Brody E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5415-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Competitor RNAs and recombinant hnRNP K were added to the splicing reaction on ice prior to adding the labeled pre mRNA. Reactions were analyzed by 7% (19:1) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RNA products were quantified using a PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Splicing efficiency was calculated as the ratio between the mRNA value or final lariat and the sum of pre-mRNA, mRNA, and lariat values. For each RNA, the number of uracil residues was taken into account for the calculated splicing efficiency. E. coliBL21(DE3) was transformed by the plasmid pET 28aK (kindly provided by G. Dreyfuss). Transformants were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 0.7 at 600 nm and induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2.5 h. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer 1 (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 50 mm NaCl and a mixture of protease inhibitors and then broken with a French press. The supernatant was adjusted to 0.5m NaCl and loaded at 0.2 ml/min on a 1-ml poly(rC) column containing 100 μg of poly(rC). The column was washed with 8 ml of buffer 1 plus 2 m NaCl. A first step elution was in buffer 1 with 8 m urea and a second step in buffer 1 with 4m guanidine HCl. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol. The protein from the guanidine HCl elution step was used in the complementation experiments. hnRNP K was more than 90% pure as judged from a control SDS gel and Western blot. Random length poly(rC) was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, 3′-biotinylated, and fixed on streptavidin-agarose beads (as described above). The yield was generally from 2.0 to 2.5 μg for 50 μl of beads. Taking 13,200 g/mol for the molecular weight of an RNA of 65 nucleotides in length, 250 pmol of poly(rC) equivalent was mixed with 1 ml of 20 or 40% nuclear extract. The proteins were prepared and analyzed on SDS and two-dimensional acrylamide gel as above. Nuclear extracts were either mock-treated or treated with an oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the 5′-end of U1 snRNA and then treated with RNase H as described by Black et al. (46.Black D.L. Chabot B. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 737-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For binding experiments, 20 or 50 fmol of32P-labeled 5′-RNAs were incubated in 12.5 μl (at 40% nuclear extract under splicing conditions with 4% polyvinyl alcohol) for 10 min at 30 °C and then irradiated on ice for 15 min in a UV (254 nm) Stratalinker. The samples were treated with 50 μl of proteinase K buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 2% lauryl sarkosyl) and 20 μg of proteinase K for 45 min at 37 °C, phenol-extracted, and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% (19:1) polyacrylamide gel. The level of the cross-linked species was quantified in a PhosphorImager. Previous studies identified an S4 enhancer that is required for the inclusion of exon 6A in myoblasts and HeLa nuclear extracts (38.Balvay L. Libri D. Gallego M. Fiszman M.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,40.Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezancon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It has been shown that several pyrimidine-rich sequences can substitute for the S4 enhancer element with different efficiencies (41.Pret A.M. Balvay L. Fiszman M.Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These sequences are a pyrimidine-rich sequence derived from the pyrimidine tract upstream of exon 3 of the rat α-tropomyosine (P3S), the pyrimidine tract downstream of exon 5 of the chicken β-tropomyosine (pyI5), and the sequence S5, which lies just downstream of S4 (Fig. 1 A). To be able to compare the proteins assembled onto the different enhancers, we first tested in vitro splicing activity of pre-mRNA 6A-7 containing the wild-type S4 enhancer sequence and the other pyrimidine-rich sequences P3S, PyI5, and S5 using the same batch of HeLa cell nuclear extract. As shown in Fig. 1 B, P3S was as efficient as S4 in promoting splicing of exon 6A. Depending on nuclear extracts, splicing activation by P3S was even higher than with S4 (40.Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezancon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As expected the S5 and PYI5 sequences were less potent activators than the S4 sequence. Splicing efficiencies decreased 2-fold for pre-mRNA 6A-S5-7 and around 1.5-fold for the pre-mRNA 6A-PyI5-7 as compared with that of the wild-type pre-mRNA (Fig. 1 B). We conclude that the hierarchy of activation promoted by the various pyrimidine sequences was maintained both in vivo and in vitro, making it possible to identify the proteins that mediate the activation of exon 6A. Splicing decisions are thought to be determined early in spliceosome assembly, at the step of commitment complex E formation that is characterized by U1 snRNP binding to the 5′ splice site (47.Reed R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To test whether the enhancer sequences S4, P3S, S5, and PYI5 promote exon 6A splicing at an early stage of spliceosome assembly, we used UV cross-linking experiments.32P-Labeled substrate RNAs shown in Fig. 2 were incubated under splicing conditions for 10 min at 30 °C, irradiated at 254 nm, and treated extensively with proteinase K to digest any cross-linked proteins. As a control for cross-linking efficiency, we used a short RNA of 33 nucleotides that was complementary to the 5′ terminus of snRNA U1 (data not shown). Upon incubation of the labeled RNAs with HeLa cell nuclear extracts, two specific cross-linked species were observed (Fig. 3). The intensity of these bands strongly decreased in HeLa nuclear extracts in which U1 snRNA had been degraded by an oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage (Fig. 3,lanes Δ). Note that a third cross-linked band was also detected with the 5′ S4 RNA that did not disappear in U1-snRNA-degraded nuclear extracts. This is most likely an intramolecular cross-link, since it was detected after UV irradiation of the RNA in splicing buffer alone (data not shown). RNase H-directed cleavage of the cross-linked RNA after UV irradiation with an oligonucleotide complementary to a region of U1 snRNA immediately downstream of the 5′ arm led to the disappearance of the two bands (data not shown). These results indicate that the cross-linked bands correspond to a functional interaction between the U1 snRNA and the 5′-splice site. Interestingly, the level of U1 snRNP interaction was strongly dependent on the downstream intronic sequence. Results from three independent experiments show that RNA P3S gave the strongest interaction (1–1.5% cross-linking efficiency) followed by S4 (0.7–1%), PYI5 (0.5–0.6%), and S5 (0.25–0.3%). The degree of U1 occupancy strongly correlates with the efficiency conferred by these sequences to exon 6A splicing, with the strong enhancers P3S a"
https://openalex.org/W2052279838,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are cationic channels activated by extracellular pH. They are present in the brain, where they are thought to participate in signal transduction associated with local pH variations, and in sensory neurons, where they have been involved in pain perception associated with tissue acidosis and in mechanoperception. The ASIC3 subunit is mainly expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons. Its expression is associated with a rapidly inactivating current followed by a slowly activating sustained current thought to be required for the tonic sensation of pain caused by acids. We report here the interaction of this channel subunit with the multivalent PDZ (PSD-95 Drosophila discs-large protein,Zonula occludens protein 1) domain-containing protein CIPP. This interaction requires the C-terminal region of ASIC3 and the fourth PDZ domain of CIPP. Co-expression of CIPP and ASIC3 in COS cells increases the maximal ASIC3 peak current density by a factor of 5 and slightly shifts the pH0.5 for activation from pH 6.2 to pH 6.4. CIPP mRNA is found at a significant level in the same dorsal root ganglion neuronal cell population that expresses the ASIC3 subunit, i.e. mainly in the small nociceptive neurons. CIPP is thus a scaffolding protein that could both enhance the surface expression of ASIC3 and bring together ASIC3 and functionally related proteins in the membrane of sensory neurons.

Co-expression of CIPP and ASIC3 in COS cells increases the maximal ASIC3 peak current density by a factor of 5 and slightly shifts the pH0.5 for activation from pH 6.2 to pH 6.4. CIPP mRNA is found at a significant level in the same dorsal root ganglion neuronal cell population that expresses the ASIC3 subunit, i.e. mainly in the small nociceptive neurons. CIPP is thus a scaffolding protein that could both enhance the surface expression of ASIC3 and bring together ASIC3 and functionally related proteins in the membrane of sensory neurons. Proton-gated Na+-permeable channels have been described in many neuronal cell types in the central nervous system as well as in nociceptive neurons (1.Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In the sensory neurons, they are thought to be responsible for the sensation of pain that accompanies tissue acidosis for instance in muscle and cardiac ischemia (2.Benson C.J. Eckert S.P.

Their function in the central nervous system is less documented, but an important role for these channels in signal transduction associated with local pH variations during normal neuronal activity (6.DeVries S.H.

They might also be involved in pathological situations such as brain ischemia and epilepsy that produce significant extracellular acidification.

ASIC1a and ASIC2b are present in brain and afferent sensory neurons, whereas the splice or initiation variant ASIC1b is found only in sensory neurons. ASIC1a and ASIC1b both mediate fast inactivating currents upon modest but rapid acidification of the external medium. ASIC2b is a modulatory subunit that can associate with other ASIC subunits, particularly ASIC3 (22.Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). ASIC3 (previously named DRASIC) is principally found in the small and medium nociceptive sensory neurons (5.Voilley N. de Weille J. Mamet J. Lazdunski M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its expression has been associated with a biphasic current comprising a fast inactivating component followed by a sustained phase (25.Waldmann R. Bassilana F. De Weille J.R. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). ASIC3 is involved in acid-evoked nociception and in some aspects of mechanosensation as recently demonstrated by its gene inactivation in mice (12.Price M.P. McIlwrath S.L. Xie J. Cheng C. Qiao J. Tarr D.E. Sluka K.A. Brennan T.J. Lewin G.R. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1071-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We have used the yeast two-hybrid approach in the present study to investigate the putative ASIC3-associated proteins in sensory neurons. We have identified the multivalent PDZ domain-containing protein CIPP (channel-interacting PDZ domain protein) as an apparent partner of ASIC3 in DRG neurons. Total RNA was isolated from freshly dissected adult rat DRG (5-week-old Wistar rats) according to the protocol of Chomczynski and Sacchi (30.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified with oligo(dT)-cellulose (type 7; Amersham Biosciences) and used to produce cDNA using the cDNA synthesis kit from Stratagene. Briefly, the kit used modified oligo(dT) primers carrying an XhoI restriction site andEcoRI adapters to allow unidirectional cloning in the appropriate vector. The cDNAs were then size-fractionated on Sepharose CL-2B gel, and cDNAs of 0.5 kb or more were pooled and ligated into the pJG4–5 prey vector previously digested with theEcoRI and XhoI restriction enzymes. After transformation in bacteria, 3.16 × 106 independent clones were obtained. Sixteen clones were randomly picked and digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and all of them contained inserts with an average size of 1.5 kb (ranging from 0.5 to more than 3 kb). Large amounts of plasmid DNA were prepared using a Qiagen Plasmid Giga kit, and the library was not subsequently amplified. An ASIC3 C-terminal bait corresponding to the last 68 amino acids of ASIC3 was used to screen 9.5 × 106 clones of the rat DRG cDNA library with the LexA-based GFP two-hybrid system (Grow'n'Glow system; MoBiTec). Several positive clones were obtained and confirmed in a second round of screening in the yeast system. The full-length mouse CIPP cDNA encoding the 612-amino acid protein and the modified CIPP and ASIC3 forms were obtained by PCR. The ASIC3 C-terminal domain that was used as a bait in the two-hybrid screen was inserted into the pGEX-3X plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) for production of a GST fusion protein in bacteria. Briefly, the bacteria pellet was resuspended in IPAB buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors), sonicated for 1 min, and then submitted to centrifugation for 20 min at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 h at 4 °C, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in IPAB buffer. In vitro translation was performed from a plasmid carrying the full-length CIPP or a form lacking the PDZ-4 preceded by a T7 promoter sequence with the TNT T7 Quick for PCR DNA system (Promega) in a final volume of 25 μl for 60 min at 30 °C in the presence of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (TranS-label; ICN). Five μl of in vitro-translated products were incubated with 50 μl of GST-glutathione-Sepharose resin for 90 min at 4 °C, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in Laemmli buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were treated with 1 m salicylic acid for 30 min, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C. Rat DRG total RNA was isolated from adult Wistar rats as described previously. About 2 μg of rat DRG total RNA were primed with random hexamers in the presence of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 10 min and then at 37 °C for 1 h and at 90 °C for 5 min. After dilution, one-twentieth of the reaction was used for PCR using the following sense and antisense primers: ASIC3, CTGGCAACGGACTGGAGATTA and TGTAGTAGCGCACGGGTTGG (amplicon of 506 bp); and CIPP, GAGGAGAACTTGGAGGTGTT and TTTGTAGGCTGGTGATGACT (amplicon of 382 bp). Twenty-five cycles of PCR (95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min) were performed, except for β-actin, for which only 22 cycles were done. One-third of the PCR reaction was resolved on a 2% agarose gel. Dorsal root ganglia from adult Wistar rats were embedded in Tissue-Tec (Sakura), frozen at −25 °C, and then cut in a cryostat and transferred onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides. The ∼12-μm sections were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 20 min. The sections were than prehybridized for 2 h and hybridized overnight at 52 °C in a solution containing 12.5% formamide, 4× SSC, 2.5× Denhardt's solution, 250 μg/ml herring sperm DNA, and 0.1% dextran sulfate. Two antisense synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the rat CIPP sequence CCTCTATTCTTTTTCCCTCCGATTTTATTCTTTTA and TTCTTGTCCTTTTCCAGTTCGATAATGTGTAGTTCTC and one sense primer corresponding to the sequence TAAAAGAATAAAATCGGA- GGGAAAAAGAATAGAGG were labeled with biotin-21-dUTP (CLONTECH) with terminal transferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then used separately for the hybridization. The sections were then washed twice with 2× SSC, once with 1× SSC, and once with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The signal was then amplified once with DAKO's GenPoint kit. After aqueous hematoxylin staining, the cryosections were mounted in Crystal Mount, viewed with a Leitz microscope, and photographed. Image processing and analysis were done using the National Institutes of Health Image program. COS cells at a density of 20,000 cells/35-mm-diameter Petri dish were transfected with a mix of the bicistronic vector pCI-CIPP-IRES-CD8 and pCI-rASIC3 (10:1 ratio) using the DEAE-dextran method. Cells were used for electrophysiological measurements 1–3 days after transfection. Successfully transfected cells were recognized by their ability to fix CD8 antibody-coated beads (Dynal). We used the patch clamp technique to measure membrane currents in whole-cell and outside-out configurations (31.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Archiv. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15121) Google Scholar). Currents were amplified with a RK-400 amplifier (Bio-Logic Science Instruments), digitized with a 16-bit data acquisition system (Digidata 1322A; Axon Instruments), and recorded on a hard disk using pClamp software (version 8.1.0.12; Axon Instruments). The data were sampled at either 3.3 or 20 kHz (for whole-cell and outside-out recordings, respectively), and low pass filtered at 3–5 kHz using an 8-pole low pass filter (Bio-Logic Science Instruments). Off-line analysis of currents was performed using pClamp (Axon Instruments) and Bio-Patch (version 3.42; Bio-Logic Science Instruments) to obtain amplitude histograms. Currents obtained from outside-out patches were digitally filtered to 1 kHz using pClamp (Axon Instruments). The statistical significance of differences between sets of data was estimated using Student's t test. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and the bath solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. MES was used instead of HEPES to buffer bath solution pH ranging from pH 6 to pH 5. Changes in extracellular pH were induced by shifting one out of six outlets of a microperfusion system in front of the cell. Cells were voltage-clamped to a constant holding potential, and experiments were carried out at room temperature (20 °C to 22 °C). A detailed analysis of the C-terminal region of ASIC3 showed that the last four amino acids form a putative binding sequence for PDZ domains (V-T-X-L) (32.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). This observation led us to search for putative ASIC3-interacting proteins by the two-hybrid genetic screen. The C-terminal region of ASIC3 was used as a bait, and an interaction cDNA library was constructed from rat adult DRG. Seventeen clones encoding incomplete forms of the CIPP protein were obtained from the 9.5 × 106 initial clones screened. They were organized in eight independent populations of clones, suggesting some specificity for the interaction of CIPP with ASIC3. CIPP is a 612-amino acid protein that contains four PDZ domains (33.Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number AF060539). All the clones identified encode proteins containing one or several PDZ domains, suggesting some interaction of these PDZ domains with the C-terminal motif of ASIC3. This was further demonstrated by the construction of different mutants of ASIC3. In the first bait, the C-terminal leucine of ASIC3 has been replaced by a phenylalanine, which was expected to abolish or strongly reduce binding of PDZ proteins (32.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). In the second bait, the last three residues of ASIC3, which are known to play a crucial role in PDZ domain recognition, have been deleted (ASIC3Δ531–533). These two baits were both unable to interact with a partial CIPP clone isolated from the library that includes the fourth PDZ domain (CIPPPDZ4, Fig. 1 A). This suggests some interaction of at least the CIPP PDZ-4 domain with the C-terminal region of ASIC3. The ASIC1 and ASIC2 C-terminal domains, which have recently been shown to interact with the PDZ-containing protein PICK1 (34.Duggan A. Garcia-Anoveros J. Corey D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5203-5208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), did not interact with CIPPPDZ4 (Fig. 1 A), consistent with the presence of a different C-terminal consensus motif. The different clones isolated from the DRG library all contained CIPP PDZ-4, but some also included PDZ-2 and PDZ-3. To check possible interactions of the ASIC3 C-terminal region with these PDZ domains of CIPP, we have produced a full-length CIPP and a form lacking the PDZ-4 domain (CIPPΔPDZ4). An interaction occurs when PDZ-4 is present (i.e. with the full-length CIPP; Fig. 1 B) but not with CIPPΔPDZ4 (Fig. 1 C), strongly suggesting that PDZ-4 is the only PDZ domain of CIPP capable of interacting with ASIC3. Surprisingly, the CIPP full-length protein co-expressed with the ASIC3 bait gave virtually no fluorescence, although the yeast were grown on selective media. However, this construct is specific for the bait used because the L533F and Δ531–533 mutations on the ASIC3 bait disrupted the interaction (Fig. 1 B). The lack of fluorescence could be explained by disparate degrees of activation of both reporter genes (35.Golemis E.A. Brent R. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-Hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1997Google Scholar) by the CIPP prey plasmid, leading to a consistent activation of the LEU2 gene but a very small activation of the GFP gene. Expression in yeast of all bait constructs was confirmed by Western blot analysis of yeast protein extracts using an anti-LexA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (data not shown). We next used the GST fusion protein binding assay to validate the interaction of CIPP with the C-terminal region of ASIC3 in an independent approach (Fig. 2). GST fusion proteins bearing the wild-type C-terminal region of ASIC3 or a C-terminal region lacking the last three residues (ASIC3Δ531–533) were used to pull-down the full-length CIPP or a form lacking the PDZ-4. The data showed the same specificity of interaction for CIPP and ASIC3 as exhibited in the yeast two-hybrid system. As expected, we did not observe binding of CIPP to a form of ASIC3 when the C-terminal PDZ recognition motif was removed or binding of ASIC3 to a form of CIPP lacking the fourth PDZ domain (Fig. 2). The interaction of CIPP with ASIC3 in the two-hybrid system and in the GST pull-down assay suggests that they may associate directly in their native environment. Unfortunately, immunoblotting or immunoprecipitating antibodies directed against CIPP and ASIC3 are not available, precluding co-immunoprecipitation analysis from native DRG cells or co-localization by immunohistochemistry. However, the CIPP transcript has been co-detected with the ASIC3 mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR from rat DRG total RNA (Fig. 3 A). The CIPP transcript was also detected in most of the rat tissues analyzed, whereas the ASIC3 transcript was almost exclusively detected in DRG, confirming and expanding the previously described distribution in rat (25.Waldmann R. Bassilana F. De Weille J.R. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The distribution of the CIPP mRNA in rat established by reverse transcription-PCR is much broader than the one found in mouse by Northern blot analysis. In mouse, CIPP has been detected exclusively in brain and kidney (33.Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but its expression in DRG was not analyzed. A more detailed analysis of the CIPP mRNA expression in rat DRG has been done by in situ hybridization (Fig. 3 B). A consistent signal in neuronal cells was obtained with two independent antisense oligonucleotide probes but not with a sense probe (Fig. 3 B). CIPP mRNA was detected in 57% of DRG neurons. Analysis of the surface area of CIPP-positive cells showed that the mean area is 560 ± 32 μm2 (Fig. 3 C). About 76% of the CIPP-positive cells have an area of <700 μm2 corresponding to small diameter (<30 μm) nociceptive neurons (Fig. 3 C). These neurons also express ASIC3 mRNA, as shown recently by Voilley et al. (5.Voilley N. de Weille J. Mamet J. Lazdunski M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a comprehensive in situ hybridization analysis of ASIC expression in DRG neurons. The ASIC3 protein was also detected in these neurons (12.Price M.P. McIlwrath S.L. Xie J. Cheng C. Qiao J. Tarr D.E. Sluka K.A. Brennan T.J. Lewin G.R. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1071-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Thus, CIPP and ASIC3 are expressed in the same population of nociceptive neurons. To explore a possible effect of CIPP on the functional expression of ASIC3, we performed co-transfection of the ASIC3 subunit with CIPP in COS cells using a CIPP bicistronic vector also carrying the cDNA for the cell surface marker CD8. Cells co-expressing CIPP and ASIC3 could be easily detected by both the binding of anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody-coated beads (Dynal) and the expression of an ASIC3 current. CIPP significantly increased the current densities of the peak current recorded with the whole-cell patch clamp technique at each pH tested (increase factor of 4.6 at pH 5, 5.7 at pH 5.5, 5.4 at pH 6, 9.8 at pH 6.4, and 8.3 at pH 6.8; n = 9–26;p < 0.001) (Fig. 4,A and B). Similarly, the sustained current measured at pH 5 was also increased by CIPP (data not shown). The pH dependence of the peak current (Fig. 4 B, inset) was slightly but significantly shifted from 6.19 ± 0.02 to 6.40 ± 0.03 in the presence of CIPP (n = 14 and 26, respectively; p < 0.001). The effect was abolished when the C-terminal deletion mutant of ASIC3 (ASIC3Δ531–533) was co-expressed with CIPP or when ASIC3 was co-transfected with the CIPP PDZ-4 deletion mutant (CIPPΔPDZ4) (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that an interaction between the CIPP PDZ-4 and the ASIC3 C terminus is essential for the functional effect to occur. Moreover, co-transfection in COS cells of CIPP with another ASIC subunit (ASIC1a) did not induce any increase of the current density (Fig. 4 C; n = 4–7; p = 0.90), and a similar result has been obtained with ASIC2a (data not shown), confirming the specificity of the interaction between CIPP and ASIC3. ASIC3 currents (with or without CIPP) have also been recorded from outside-out patches (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 A shows typical currents obtained for a transient acidification of the external medium from pH 7.4 to pH 6.8. Due to the important activity of the channels, especially in the presence of CIPP, it was decided to show currents obtained for a low external acidification to distinguish the elementary events more clearly (Fig. 5 A). As indicated by the histograms on Fig. 5 B, CIPP did not change the unitary amplitude of ASIC3 current recorded at −50 mV (−1.31 ± 0.03 pA (n = 7)versus −1.42 ± 0.09 pA (n = 6), with and without CIPP, respectively; p = 0.29). The slope conductance of ASIC3 (Fig. 5 C) was 11.2 ± 0.4 and 10.5 ± 1.7 picosiemens in the presence and absence of CIPP, respectively. These values are close to the unitary conductance reported previously for ASIC3 (12.6 picosiemens) (25.Waldmann R. Bassilana F. De Weille J.R. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data show that the biophysical properties of ASIC3 (unitary conductance and ionic selectivity) are not modified by CIPP but that the NPo of the channel is significantly increased in the presence of CIPP. Ion channels, receptors, and cytosolic signaling proteins are highly organized at the plasma membrane. The modular domains of multidomain scaffolding proteins are fundamentally important in this organization and in coordinating signaling. CIPP is a PDZ domain-containing protein that contains four PDZ domains. CIPP has been cloned from a mouse cerebellum cDNA library with the two-hybrid system using an artificial peptide containing the C-terminal sequence V-S-D-L as bait (33.Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this sequence, which corresponds to a type I (S/T-X-V/L) PDZ-interacting domain, is highly similar to the C-terminal sequence of the ASIC3 protein (V-T-R-L). CIPP was found to interact in vitro with several ion channels and neuronal cell surface molecules. All the described interactions involved PDZ-2 and PDZ-3, and no cellular ligands of the first and the last PDZ domains were identified (33.Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For instance, the inward rectifying K+ channel Kir4.1 and the neuronal cell surface molecule neuroligin interact specifically with PDZ-2, whereas Kir4.2 and the NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) associate with both PDZ-2 and PDZ-3 (33.Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The NMDA receptor subunit 2C (NR2C) and the cell surface molecule neurexin interact exclusively with PDZ-3 (33.Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have shown here that ASIC3 is a specific ligand of the CIPP PDZ-4 domain. Consistent with this, the artificial PDZ-binding peptide used as a bait in the initial isolation of CIPP also exclusively interacts with CIPP PDZ-4 (33.Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CIPP PDZ-4 has particular features that could explain this specificity. As indicated by Kurschner et al., (33.Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) the conserved GLGF motif, that characterizes PDZ motifs and functions in mediation of the binding of defined peptide sequences is found in PDZ-1, PDZ-2, and PDZ-3, but this motif is significantly different in PDZ-4 (corresponding sequence, ALGI). Thus, the specificity of each CIPP PDZ domain seems to be different, and PDZ-4 associates with proteins that differ from the ligands of PDZ-2 and PDZ-3. CIPP thus appears to be a scaffolding protein that assembles in the membrane of sensory neurons ASIC3 (connected to CIPP PDZ-4) and other proteins interacting with PDZ 1–3 that may also couple ASIC3 to intracellular signaling networks or to modulatory proteins. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that the co-expression of CIPP with ASIC3 in COS cells led to a significant increase of ASIC3 current densities. CIPP was previously shown to be able to double the current densities of the potassium channel Kir4.1 in COS-7 transfected cells (33.Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The effect of CIPP on ASIC3 is much stronger because it corresponds to a 5-fold increase of the maximal peak current densities measured at pH 5 and pH 5.5. CIPP also slightly shifts the pH dependence of activation of the ASIC3 peak current toward a more alkaline pH, which accounts for the higher increase of peak current densities (10-fold) at pH values between pH 6.4 and pH 6.8. CIPP does not change the biophysical properties of ASIC3, and the increase in peak current densities thus reflects an increase in the NPoof the channel. It seems most probable that this is due to a larger number of active channels in the membrane, although we cannot completely rule out an effect on Po. This could result from the integration of new channels in the membrane, from a decrease of channel recycling from the membrane, or from the activation of already present but silent channels. Recent studies suggest that PDZ-containing proteins can indeed influence the cell surface expression of their target proteins by, for instance, affecting their insertion, endocytosis, and recycling (36.Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). For example, the PDZ protein syntenin mediates cell surface expression of pro-TGF through interaction with the receptor while it is in the endoplasmic reticulum. Pro-TGFa is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and an interaction with syntenin is necessary for the release from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent surface expression. Mutants of pro-TGFa that disrupt PDZ protein-protein interactions block cell surface targeting (37.Fernandez-Larrea J. Merlos-Suarez A. Urena J.M. Baselga J. Arribas J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the interaction of the β2 adrenergic receptor with NHERF/ABP50 regulates plasma membrane recycling of the receptor after endocytosis (38.Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The present data suggest that PDZ domain-containing proteins also regulate ASIC3 surface expression, although the precise underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. This could constitute another example of the role of PDZ proteins in membrane protein trafficking, beside their function as scaffolding or anchoring proteins at specific sites in the membrane. The present study has revealed CIPP as an apparent partner of ASIC3 in sensory neurons. Moreover, CIPP is able to modulate the ASIC3 currentin vitro. CIPP-interacting proteins have already been identified in vitro from brain neurons, but it is not clear whether these previously described proteins (i.e. the inward rectifying K+ channel Kir4.1, the neurexin and neuroligin cell surface molecules, and the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors) are also associated with CIPP in sensory neurons and if they could have any functional connection with ASIC3. Unveiling the CIPP-associated proteins in DRG neurons, including the as yet unidentified ligand(s) of the first PDZ domain, will certainly help to clarify this issue. The identification of proteins that could assemble with ASIC3 in the membrane of sensory neurons is essential to better understand the regulation and function of ASIC channels in sensory perception and particularly in nociception.

MATs from various organisms contain ∼400-amino acid polypeptide chains. However we have recently found that the protein sequences comprise two categories, the extensively studied eucaryal-bacterial type (encoded by a catalytic subunit denoted α (Ref. 10.Kotb M. Mudd S.H.

Within each category the sequences are highly conserved,e.g. there is 59% identity between the human andEscherichia coli MAT α subunits. In contrast, the sequences of the two classes are widely diverged, e.g. there is only 22% identity between the Methanococcus jannaschiiγ-type MAT and either the E. coli or human α subunits. The variation in sequence follows evolutionary lines and is not simply related to the habitat of the organism because MATs from hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea fall in the same classes as MATs from mesophiles of the same kingdom (11.Graham D.E.

Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 21-154Google Scholar). Both divalent cations (e.g. Mg2+) and monovalent cations (e.g. K+) are required for maximal activity. Whether the same catalytic mechanism operates with the archaeal enzyme, particularly at elevated temperature, is of interest in view of the unclear role of PPPi hydrolysis in the thermodynamics of AdoMet formation (12.McQueney M.S.

Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenecillin. Induction of MjMAT expression was obtained by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a 20-fold dilution of an overnight culture and shaking for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until use. The cell pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm DTT, 30 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8, using 10 ml of buffer/g (wet weight) of cells. The cells were lysed by one pass through a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 20% saturation, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Ammonium sulfate was then added to the supernatant to 80% saturation, and the pellet was collected by centrifugation. The scale of following steps is described for a preparation from 25 g (wet weight) of cells. The ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in ∼20 ml of Buffer A (containing 50 mmTris·HCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 8) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 liters of the same buffer. The protein was divided into 5-ml portions and heated in a 85 °C water bath for 30 min. Precipitated materials were removed by centrifugation. Chromatographic steps were performed at room temperature. The protein was dialyzed overnight into 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, and then NaCl and imidazole were added to final concentrations of 300 and 5 mm, respectively. The sample was loaded onto a 2 × 15-cm column of Ni2+-His·Bind resin (Novagen) that was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris·HCl, 300 mmNaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 8. The column was washed with 80 ml of starting buffer (at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min) and eluted with a 200-ml gradient from the starting buffer to a final buffer of 50 mm Tris·HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 500 mmimidazole, pH 8. The fractions containing activity were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 8, and stored at −80 °C. Minor contaminants were subsequently removed by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Before ion exchange chromatography, the protein was equilibrated in 25 mm MES, 1 mmDTT, pH 6, by dialysis. The protein was loaded onto a HiLoad Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column (2.6 × 12 cm) equilibrated and washed with 100 ml of dialysis buffer (at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min), and the protein was eluted with a 500-ml gradient of this buffer also containing 0.7 m KCl. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris·HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 8. Final purification was obtained by gel filtration chromatography of 2-ml aliquots on a 2 × 60-cm Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted at 0.5 ml/min with 50 mm Tris·HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0. The final protein displayed a single band on Coomassie Blue-stained 8–25% gradient polyacrylamide Phast gels (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence and absence of SDS. The concentration of purified MjMAT was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.0 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1 as calculated from the amino acid composition (19.Genetics Computer GroupPeptidesort, Version 10. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1999Google Scholar). Approximately 50 mg of enzyme were obtained from 15 g (wet weight) of cells. E. coli AdoMet synthetase (EcMAT) was purified as described previously (20.Reczkowski R.S. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13499-13506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). AdoMet synthetase activity was determined by a [14C]AdoMet cation exchange filter binding method (20.Reczkowski R.S. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13499-13506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 55 °C in 25 mmHepes·(CH3)4N+ at pH 8.0 with 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Routine assays contained 9.5 mm ATP and 0.5 mm[methyl-14C]methionine. Substrate saturation data were evaluated using the kinetic equations of Cleland (21.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar) or the kinetics module of Sigmaplot 2000 (SPSS Science), which utilizes the Segel formalism (22.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). All fits were consistent with linear dependence of activity on substrate and/or inhibitor concentration. Inhibition studies were conducted with substrate concentrations near theirK m values. The activation energy for AdoMet synthesis, E a, was calculated from the slope of linear ranges of an Arrhenius plot of ln(k cat) versus 1/T(slope = −E a/R). The free energy of activation, ΔG #, was calculated as ΔG # =RT(ln(k B T/h) − ln(k cat)) where R = 1.9872 cal/mol-K, k B is the Boltzmann constant,h is Planck's constant, and k cat is the value measured at temperature T. The activation enthalpy, ΔH #, was calculated as (E a − RT). The activation entropy ΔS # was then obtained from (ΔH # − ΔG #)/T (23.Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A more complete analysis of the temperature dependence of reaction rates considers that nonlinearity of an Arrhenius plot may arise from heat capacity change during the reaction, ΔC p# (24.Cooper A. Johnson C.M. Lakey J.H. Nollmann M. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, with respect to a reference temperature (T 0, defined as 37 °C), at a given temperature T, ΔH #(T) = ΔH #(T 0) + ΔC p#(T −T 0) and ΔS #(T) = Δ#(T 0) + ΔC p#(ln(T/T 0)). These relationships were used in fitting the observed data for MjMAT via nonlinear least squares using the program Scientist (MicroMath Inc.). The phosphorus-containing reaction products were identified by evaluating PPPi, PPi, and Piformation from [γ-33P]ATP in the presence and absence of inorganic pyrophosphatase. Compounds were separated by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose anion exchange thin layer sheets (EM Science) developed in 0.9 m LiCl, 50 mm EDTA, pH 7. The radiation was quantified using a Fuji phosphorimager. A 33PPPi standard was prepared from the [γ-33P]ATP by periodate oxidation followed by aniline cleavage (12.McQueney M.S. Anderson K.S.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1496-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); 33PPiwas prepared from 33PPPi using E. coli MAT. Solutions contained 5 mm ATP (4.4 × 104 cpm/nmol), 5 mm methionine, 1 mg/ml MjMAT, 100 mm Hepes, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2; when present, 0.025 units/μl inorganic pyrophosphatase were added. Time points were taken from 1 to 60 min. ATP was removed from the reactions by adsorption to Norit before TLC (12.McQueney M.S. Anderson K.S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ATP, Pi, PPi, and PPPi standards had RF values of 0.27, 0.8, 0.13, and 0.04, respectively. After 4 h, ∼77% of the33P was present as Pi. The reverse reaction was examined in two ways: by looking for either the formation of [carboxy-14C]methionine from [carboxy-14C]AdoMet or the formation of [33P]ATP or 33PPPi from33Pi. In the first case, 0.2 mm[carboxy-14C]AdoMet (56 mCi/mmol), 5 mm PPi, and 5 mm Piwere incubated with 1 mg/ml enzyme in 0.1 m Tris·Cl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 for up to 60 min at 55 °C. Compounds were separated by thin layer chromatography on cellulose sheets developed in n-butyl alcohol:acetic acid:water (25:4:10) in which AdoMet and methionine haveRF values of 0.26 and 0.56, respectively. Radioactivity was quantified by phosphorimaging. In the latter case, 5 mm AdoMet, 5 mm PPi, and 5 mm33Pi (11 mCi/mmol) were incubated with 1 mg/ml enzyme for up to 60 min at 55 °C. Compounds were separated by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose sheets and radioactivity quantified as described above. Protein secondary structure was assessed from circular dichroism spectra obtained on an Aviv model 62A spectropolarimeter. Samples (0.3 mg/ml protein in 25 mmTris·HCl, 25 mm KCl, pH 8.0) were placed in 1-mm path length cells; spectra were recorded from 200 to 260 nm and were corrected for buffer contributions. Recombinant MjMAT was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity fromE. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein was allowed to retain an N-terminal decahistidine tag, because we had found that the properties of the recombinant protein were comparable with those of the protein isolated from M. jannaschii (11.Graham D.E.

Recombinant MjMAT chromatographed with aM r of 86,000 on gel filtration, consistent with its being a dimer of 45-kDa subunits (11.Graham D.E. Bock C.L. Schalk-Hihi C. Lu Z.J. Markham G.D. J. Biol.

Markham, unpublished results. and attempts to obtain diffraction quality crystals are in progress. CD spectra were compared for MjMAT and the E. coli enzyme to assess potential similarities in secondary structure (Fig. 1). MjMAT displays substantially larger ellipticity at 220 nm, a wavelength characteristic of the proportion of α-helix. The crystal structures of the E. coli and rat liver enzymes show that they are composed of ∼25% α-helix and ∼20% β-sheet (26.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Misaki S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 136-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 27.Gonzalez B. Pajares M.A. Hermoso J.A. Alvarez L. Garrido F. Sufrin J.R. Sanz-Aparicio J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The differences in CD spectra suggest that the overall secondary structure of MjMAT is more helical than the eucaryal or bacterial MAT-α. A notable feature of MAT-α-catalyzed reaction is that the products released from the enzyme are PPi and Pi, rather than PPPi initially formed in conjunction with AdoMet synthesis. The PPPi formed as an intermediate is primarily hydrolyzed even before it can reorient, with the result that >95% Pioriginates from the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP (6.Mudd S.H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 21-154Google Scholar). Our previous studies of MjMAT demonstrated that PPi and Piwere formed as products (11.Graham D.E. Bock C.L. Schalk-Hihi C. Lu Z.J. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4055-4059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When the products formed in the MjMAT-catalyzed reaction from [γ-33P]ATP were analyzed,33Pi constituted 93% of the product and 7% was present in 33PPi;33PPPi was not detected. Thus, even at the 55 °C temperature used in this experiment, the PPPiinitially created upon AdoMet synthesis neither dissociates from the enzyme nor readily reorients before hydrolysis, and Piprimarily originates from the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP (11.Graham D.E. Bock C.L. Schalk-Hihi C. Lu Z.J. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4055-4059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Attempts were made to measure the reverse reaction by conversion of [carboxy-14C]AdoMet or33Pi to radiolabeled methionine or ATP, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). In neither case was any reaction observed, even using levels of enzyme and reaction times where 0.1% conversion could be measured; less than 0.1 eq of ATP, PPPi, or AdoMet, per enzyme subunit, was formed in a 2500-fold longer time than that required for a single turnover in the forward direction. Thus, reversal of both the AdoMet forming and the PPPi hydrolytic steps appears to be unfavorable. This result is concordant with the established kinetic as well as thermodynamic irreversibility of AdoMet synthesis in reactions catalyzed by the α-type enzyme (6.Mudd S.H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 21-154Google Scholar, 12.McQueney M.S. Anderson K.S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). No reaction was detected in the absence of Mg2+, consistent with the divalent cation requirement of other MATs. K+ both enhanced thek cat by 5-fold and decreased theK m values for both substrates, with half-maximal effect at 5 mm (Fig. 2). Saturating KCl decreased the K m for ATP from 1.4 to 0.22 mm and the K m for methionine from 1.1 to 0.3 mm. Plots of 1/v versus1/K+ at different substrate concentrations (and the converse) did not intersect on the 1/v axis, showing that the cation and substrate binding are not related by an equilibrium ordered binding process. The data indicate that K+ is a stimulator rather than an essential activator, in common with the α-type MATs. Substrate saturation kinetic studies of the AdoMet synthetic reaction show that MjMAT catalyzes a sequential reaction in which both ATP and methionine bind before products are released (Fig. 3,A and B). The K m values do not vary substantially with the concentrations of co-substrate, indicating little synergism in binding affinity.Figure 3Steady state kinetics of AdoMet formation. A and B show substrate saturation at different ATP and methionine concentrations. C–Lillustrate inhibition by A(S)TP, l-ethionine, AdoMet, PPi, and Pi, respectively. When methionine was varied the ATP concentration was fixed at 0.2 mm, and when ATP was varied the methionine concentration was fixed at 0.4 mm. The concentrations of inhibitors used were as follows: A(S)TP (C and D): 0, 0.3, and 0.6 mm;l-ethionine (E and F): 0, 20, and 40 mm; AdoMet (G and H): 0, 1.5, and 3.0 mm; PPi (I and J): 0, 0.5, and 1.5 mm; Pi (K): 0, 1.0, and 2.0 mm; and Pi (L): 0, 0.6, and 1.2 mm. Solutions contained 25 mmHepes·(CH3)4N+, 50 mmKCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 at pH 8.0. Reactions were conducted at 55 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An ATP analog that contains a C5′-S-P linkage was not a substrate for AdoMet formation, but was a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP and noncompetitive with respect to methionine (Fig. 3, C andD), with a K i comparable with theK m for ATP (Table I). The alternate substrate GTP was also a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP and noncompetitive with methionine (AdoMet formation was measured with [8-14C]ATP in these inhibition experiments). A nonreactive analog of methionine that has high affinity was not identified. Cycloleucine, 1-amino-1-carboxy-cyclopentane, is a commonly used dead-end inhibitor of the α-type enzymes (28.Coulter A.W. Lombardini J.B. Sufrin J.R. Talalay P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 319-334PubMed Google Scholar). However, 20 mm cycloleucine gave no detectable inhibition of MjMAT, even with both the substrates present at their K mvalues. Furthermore, MjMAT was not significantly inhibited (<10%) by 10 mm concentrations of l-homocysteine,l-norleucine, orl-cis-2-amino-4-methoxy-3-butenoic acid (the most potent methionine analog inhibitor of MAT-α (Ref. 18.Sufrin J.R. Lombardini J.B. Keith D.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)). The alternate substrates l-ethionine andl-methionine methyl ester were competitive inhibitors with respect to methionine for AdoMet formation from [methyl-14C]methionine, and noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to ATP (cf. Fig. 3, E andF). The observed pattern of inhibition by nonreactive compounds and alternate substrates indicates that substrate binding is random. Both ethionine and methionine methyl ester have much smallerK m values than their K i values for inhibition of the reaction with methionine (6- and 70-fold, respectively), suggesting the presence of substantial kinetic contributions to the K m. The noncompetitive inhibition toward methionine by nonreactive ATP analogs reflects formation of dead-end enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complexes (21.Cleland W.W.

Pyrophosphate is a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP (K i = 0.83 mm) and noncompetitive with respect to methionine (Fig. 3, I andJ). Phosphate is a competitive inhibitor towardboth ATP and methionine, with K i values comparable with the K i for PPi (Fig. 3,K and L).

(2001) Mol. Biol. Cell 12, 663–673). Using phocein as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified two novel interacting proteins, nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDPK) and Eps15. Immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments involving native and/or recombinant phocein and, respectively, NDPK and Eps15, biochemically validated their interactions. NDPK and Eps15 were recently shown to be functional neighbors of dynamin. Dynamin I is shown here to directly interact with NDPK through its C-terminal proline-rich domain, whereas recombinant phocein associates with native dynamin I. Immunocytochemical studies of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons demonstrated partial co-localization of phocein and dynamin I. Phocein thus appears to be a component of the complexes involved in some steps of the vesicular traffic machinery. Phocein, an intracellular protein interacting with striatin, bears a few homologies with the ς-subunits of clathrin adaptor proteins (Baillat, G., Moqrich, A., Castets, F., Baude, A., Bailly, Y., Benmerah, A., and Monneron, A.

Immunocytochemical studies of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons demonstrated partial co-localization of phocein and dynamin I. Phocein thus appears to be a component of the complexes involved in some steps of the vesicular traffic machinery. Phocein, highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom, is a 26-kDa intracellular protein expressed in multiple tissues (1Baillat G. Moqrich A. Castets F. Baude A. Bailly Y. Benmerah A. Monneron A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The sequence of phocein contains within its N- and C-terminal regions several short stretches homologous to the ς-subunits of clathrin adaptor complexes, suggesting a role in vesicular traffic. Subcellular fractionation of HeLa cells and rat brain showed that phocein partitions between the cytosol and the detergent-soluble membrane fractions. In unpolarized cells, phocein is prominent in the Golgi area, whereas in mature neurons, it is found in the perikaryal-dendritic region (1Baillat G. Moqrich A. Castets F. Baude A. Bailly Y. Benmerah A. Monneron A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Phocein is a direct partner of the members of the striatin family (1Baillat G. Moqrich A. Castets F. Baude A. Bailly Y. Benmerah A. Monneron A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This family includes striatin, SG2NA, and zinedin, which are multimodular, WD repeat, and calmodulin-binding proteins thought to act both as scaffolds and as signaling proteins (2Castets F.

Phocein co-localizes with striatin and/or SG2NA (1Baillat G. Moqrich A. Castets F. Baude A. Bailly Y. Benmerah A. Monneron A. Mol. Biol.

To further investigate the function of phocein, we searched for phocein partners using the two-hybrid screen in yeast. Several partners of phocein were found, including: the β-subunit of nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDPK, 1The abbreviations used are: NDPKnucleoside-diphosphate kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferasePRDproline-rich domainPBSphosphate-buffered salineNGSnormal goat serumCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate EC 2.7.4.6) and Eps15. NDPKs are ubiquitous enzymes that exchange γ-phosphates between nucleoside tri- and diphosphates (7Parks R.E. Agarwal R.P. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 307-333Google Scholar). Eps15 is a multidomain protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (8Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol.

Recently, NDPK and Eps15 have been shown by genetic studies to be functional neighbors of dynamin, a GTPase that plays a critical role in endocytosis; NDPK mutations in Drosophila, as well as Eps15 mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans, enhance the phenotypes of dynamin mutations (10Krishnan K.S.

Altogether, these findings strengthen the hypothesis that phocein participates in membrane traffic and more specifically in membrane budding reactions. nucleoside-diphosphate kinase glutathione S-transferase proline-rich domain phosphate-buffered saline normal goat serum 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate Phocein fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain was used as a bait to search for fusion proteins expressed by a rat brain cDNA library encoding the activation domain of Gal4 (plasmid pGAD10, Matchmaker, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) (12Dagher M.-C. Filhol-Cochet O. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A full-length phocein insert (1Baillat G. Moqrich A. Castets F. Baude A. Bailly Y. Benmerah A. Monneron A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was ligated into the pLex-11 vector (a gift from M.C. Dagher, CEA Grenoble, France) in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain, yielding plasmid pLex-pho. L40 yeast strain cells grown in minimal medium were transformed with pLex-pho, using the lithium acetate method (13Gietz D, St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). The Lex-pho fusion protein was stably expressed in L40 cells, as verified by immunoblotting using anti-phocein antibodies. L40 cells expressing Lex-pho were transformed with the plasmid library. From 8 × 106 colonies obtained 5 days after cotransfection, 100 were His+. They were tested for β-galactosidase activity by a color filter assay using the substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-d-galactoside (X-gal). Plasmids from the 68 His+/LacZ+ colonies were prepared according to Kimmel and Berger (14Kimmel A.R. Berger S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After electroporation in Escherichia coli HB101 cells of Leu− phenotype, the selected library plasmids were rescued by complementing the Leu− phenotype on minimal medium and subjected to restriction analysis. Selected inserts were sequenced (ESGS, Paris, France). Anti-phocein antibodies have been described (1Baillat G. Moqrich A. Castets F. Baude A. Bailly Y. Benmerah A. Monneron A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Anti-dynamin goat antibodies (sc-6402, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were directed against the proline-rich, C-terminal domain (PRD) of human dynamin I. A rabbit anti-NDPK A antibody (sc-343) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; it cross-reacts with the β-subunit of NDPK. A goat anti-Eps15 antibody (sc-11716) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and a monoclonal anti-Eps15 antibody was a gift from P. Di Fiore. They recognize at least two proteins of 135 and 120 kDa, which are believed to be diversely phosphorylated species of Eps15. For immunocytochemistry, the monoclonal anti-dynamin Hudy-1 antibody was used (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Fluorescent secondary antibodies used for confocal microscopy were Alexa-conjugated antibodies from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Adult Wistar rats were deeply anesthetized using a mixture of 0.5 ml of ketamine (50 mg/ml, Rhône-Mérieux) and 0.37 ml of xylazine (2 mg/kg, Bayer). Brain homogenates were prepared in TBS buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mm, pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mm containing inhibitors of proteases, 10-ml final volume for one brain). Cytosol was obtained by centrifuging the homogenate for 1 h at 100,000 ×g, 4 °C. The pellet was homogenized in TBS-CHAPS buffer (TBS buffer containing 7.5 mm CHAPS and 0.5m NaCl) and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. The supernatant was referred to as the CHAPS fraction. Protein was determined using the Schaffner and Weissmann assay (15Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). There was no need to overexpress the interacting proteins since they were represented in sufficient amounts in brain extracts. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, 300–600 μl of freshly obtained brain cytosol or CHAPS fraction (250 mm NaCl final concentration) were incubated with 40 μg of affinity-purified rabbit anti-phocein antibodies or 40 μg of affinity-purified rabbit anti-NDPK antibodies or 40 μg of rabbit preimmune immunoglobulins (Sigma) overnight at either 4 or 30 °C with gentle agitation. Batches of 40 μl of Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) washed in TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to the samples and further incubated at the appropriate temperature for 4 h. Dynabeads were washed several times in the appropriate TBS or TBS-CHAPS buffers and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. The solubilized proteins were analyzed on 8 and 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Protran membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The antibodies used to reveal Western blots were described above and diluted to 0.2–1 μg/ml. Bound antibodies were detected using the ECL procedure (Pierce) or the phosphatase-alkaline procedure (Promega, Madison, WI). In some cases, the amount of the relevant protein (phocein and Eps15) in the immunoprecipitates (respectively obtained with anti-NDPK and anti-phocein antibodies) was quantified and expressed as the percent of the protein present in the samples of cytosol prior to incubation with the antibody (three separate experiments). Precise quantification was achieved by densitometric analyses of the immunoreactive bands using the NIH Image 1.59 software. Recombinant rat NDPK was obtained as follows. A 786-bp NcoI-EcoRI fragment of a plasmid selected from the yeast library, pGAD-NDPK (see below), was subcloned in a modified pGEX-KT vector (Amersham Biosciences) carrying the PreScission Protease site and yielded plasmid pGEX-P-NDPK. This plasmid encodes the full-length NDPK sequence in-frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST). E. coli DH5 α cells were transformed and, upon induction by 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, expressed high levels of GST-P-NDPK (43 kDa). The cells were lysed, and the fusion protein contained in the soluble fraction was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant phocein was obtained by subcloning the phocein cDNA in the modified pGEX-KT vector, as described above. pGEX-6P-PRD was obtained by inserting the PRD fragment of dynamin I into pGEX-6P (16Grabs D.

GST-P-NDPK, GST-P-phocein, and GST-P-PRD were eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose resin using reduced glutathione and used as such. Alternatively, NDPK, phocein, and PRD were cleaved from GST using PreScission protease (AmershamBiosciences), as indicated by the supplier. The polyhistidine human dynamin I deletion construct missing the PRD domain (His-dynamin Δ PRD), as well as GST-amphiphysin construct (amino acids 545–695), were described (16Grabs D. Slepnev V.I.

After three washes in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, beads were incubated with gentle agitation overnight at either 4 or 30 °C with 300 μl of rat brain cytosol or 300 μl of CHAPS fraction or with 150–300 μl of 5 μm solutions of recombinant NDPK or dynamin I PRD fragment or phocein. After extensive washes with PBS containing 7.5 mm CHAPS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the beads were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and treated as above. Cultures of primary E18 hippocampal neurons were prepared as described (17Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Neurons at stages 3 and 5 were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, washed in PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum (NGS) for 15 min at room temperature. After several washes, cells were blocked with PBS containing 10% NGS (PBS/NGS) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated in PBS/NGS containing 10 μg/ml of either the monoclonal anti-dynamin Hudy-1 or mouse preimmune immunoglobulins (Sigma) and 5 μg/ml of either rabbit anti-phocein antibodies or rabbit preimmune antibodies (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes in PBS, hippocampal neurons were incubated in PBS/NGS containing Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:800) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:400) for 1 h at room temperature followed by several washes in PBS. Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol. Labeling was viewed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS) equipped with an argon-krypton laser (488-, 568-, and 657-nm excitation lines). For double staining, light emitted from the two fluorophores was detected sequentially. Band-pass filters were chosen to select each emission. Images were reconstructed from a series of optical sections taken in the x-y plane from consecutive z positions (0.45–0.5 μm apart) using the standard microscope software (Leica Scanware). Original fields were made up of 512 × 512 pixels. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop. To identify interacting proteins, phocein was used as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA library. Among the 68 positive clones obtained, 5 encoded NDPK, 2 encoded a fragment of Eps15, 26 encoded the ferritin H chain, and 35 contained plasmids of different insert sizes, not further studied. Four positive identical clones encoded an insert of 0.9 kb containing the 456-bp entire sequence of the β-subunit of NDPK (18Shimada N. Ishikawa N. Munakata Y. Toda T. Watanabe K. Kimura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2583-2589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); a fifth positive clone encoded a 1.3-kb insert encompassing the latter sequence and extending further into the 3′ non-coding sequence. Rat NDPKs consist of homo-hexamers of α or β isoforms, which are 89% identical (18Shimada N. Ishikawa N. Munakata Y. Toda T. Watanabe K. Kimura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2583-2589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both isoforms are found in brain. Two identical positive clones contained a 1.7-kb insert encoding the last 317 C-terminal amino acids of Eps15 and part of the 3′ non-coding sequence. The C-terminal domain of Eps15 contains several Asp-Pro-Phe (DPF) motifs and binds the ear domain of α-adaptin (8Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In vitro biochemical confirmation of the interactions revealed by the yeast two-hybrid screen was achieved by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of rat brain proteins and by pull-down experiments. Phocein and NDPK were found in brain cytosol (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 1) as well as in CHAPS-solubilized membrane fractions, abbreviated as CHAPS fractions (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 4). Anti-NDPK antibodies immunoprecipitated NDPK from cytosol (Fig. 1B, lane 2) or from CHAPS fractions (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Phocein endogenous to each fraction coimmunoprecipitated with NDPK (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 5). From 5 to 10% of the phocein contained in the cytosol sample was immunoprecipitated by the anti-NDPK antibodies (mean of three experiments). Control immunoprecipitates obtained with preimmune immunoglobulins contained neither phocein nor NDPK (Fig. 1,A and B, lanes 3 and 6). Reciprocally, anti-phocein antibodies incubated with rat brain cytosol fractions coimmunoprecipitated small amounts of NDPK together with phocein (Fig. 1C, lane 2), whereas control immunoprecipitates contained neither protein (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Performing the incubations at 30 versus4 °C resulted in slightly enhanced amounts of coimmunoprecipitated protein. Varying the Ca2+ concentration of the incubated samples did not affect the latter parameter. We further demonstrated that the interaction between phocein and NDPK is direct using GST pull-down experiments with recombinant proteins. GST-phocein (Fig. 2A, lane 1) pulled down recombinant NDPK (Fig. 2B, lane 1), whereas GST did not (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Reciprocally, GST-P-NDPK (Fig. 2A, lane 3) pulled down recombinant phocein (Fig. 2B, lane 3), whereas GST did not (Fig. 2A, lane 4).Figure 2GST-phocein and recombinant NDPK physically interact.A, Ponceau red staining of a blot containing GST-phocein (lane 1), GST-P-NDPK (lane 3), and GST (lanes 2 and 4) incubated with recombinant rat NDPK (lanes 1 and 2) or recombinant rat phocein (lanes 3 and 4).

Eps15 contained in endogenous rat brain cytosol (Fig. 3,lane 1) was detected in small amounts in immunoprecipitates obtained with antibodies directed against phocein (Fig. 3, lane 2), whereas it was absent from immunoprecipitates obtained with preimmune immunoglobulins (Fig. 3, lane 3). From 1 to 6% of the Eps15 contained in the cytosol sample was immunoprecipitated by anti-phocein antibodies. Pull-down experiments showed that Eps15 contained in rat brain cytosol fractions was pulled down by GST-phocein (Fig. 3, lane 4) but not by GST (Fig. 3, lane 5). Attempts to express the correctly folded protein GST fused to the C-terminal fragment of Eps is in sufficient amount to study its putative interaction with recombinant phocein were unsuccessful. Dynamin has been shown to be a direct partner of Eps15 (11Salcini A.E. Hilliard M.A. Croce A. Arbucci S. Luzzi C. Tacchetti C. Daniell L., De Camilli P. Pelicci P.G., Di Fiore P.P. Bazzicalupo P. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and a potential partner of NDPK (10Krishnan K.S. Rikhy R. Rao S. Shivalkar M. Mosko M. Narayanan R. Etter P. Estes P.S. Ramaswami M. Neuron. 2001; 30: 197-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since phocein was proposed to have a role in vesicular traffic, we investigated whether phocein interacts with dynamin I. As shown in Fig. 4, immunoprecipitates obtained by incubating anti-phocein antibodies with rat brain cytosol (lane 3) contained dynamin I. Likewise, pull-down experiments conducted with GST-phocein (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 2) incubated with rat brain cytosol (Fig. 5A, lane 1) or a CHAPS fraction (Fig. 5A, lane 2) showed that dynamin was pulled down by GST-phocein (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2), whereas it was not pulled down by GST (Fig. 5,A and B, lane 3). However, attempts to demonstrate a direct interaction between dynamin and phocein using recombinant proteins (GST-P-PRD, His-dynamin Δ PRD, and phocein) yielded only negative results, although GST-P-PRD was able to pull down recombinant amphiphysin (not shown) (16Grabs D.

Hilliard M.A. Croce A. Arbucci S. Luzzi C. Tacchetti C. Daniell L., De Camilli P. Pelicci P.G., Di Fiore P.P. Bazzicalupo P. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), no physical association of NDPK with dynamin could be demonstrated despite a strong genetic interaction between the two proteins in Drosophila (10Krishnan K.S. Rikhy R. Rao S. Shivalkar M. Mosko M. Narayanan R. Etter P. Estes P.S. Ramaswami M. Neuron. 2001; 30: 197-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We further investigated the interaction between NDPK and dynamin. Dynamin I was present in immunoprecipitates obtained by incubating anti-NDPK antibodies with rat brain cytosol (Fig. 4, lane 2) or a CHAPS fraction (Fig. 4,lane 5), whereas immunoprecipitates obtained with control antibodies were devoid of dynamin I (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 6). We next incubated the fusion protein GST-P-NDPK with rat brain cytosol (Fig. 6A, lane 1) or a CHAPS fraction (Fig. 6A, lane 2); in both cases, GST-P-NDPK pulled down endogenous dynamin I (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 2), whereas GST did not (Fig. 6, A and B, lane 3). To determine whether the interaction between recombinant dynamin and NDPK is direct, we performed pull-down experiments involving GST-P-NDPK (Fig. 6A, lane 4) and the recombinant PRD fragment. GST-P-NDPK pulled down this PRD fragment (Fig. 6B, lane 4), whereas GST did not (Fig. 6B, lane 5). GST-P-NDPK did not pull down the fusion protein containing dynamin deleted from the PRD (not shown). Reciprocally, GST-P-PRD (Fig. 6A, lane 6) pulled down recombinant NDPK (Fig. 6B, lane 6), whereas GST (Fig. 6A, lane 7) did not (Fig. 6B, lane 7). Hippocampal cells from rat E18 embryos, cultured for 3 and 10 days (Banker's stages 3 and 5), extended several branched neurites (Fig. 7, A and B). Phocein immunoreactivity (green fluorescence) was conspicuous all over the soma, except for nuclei, and involved all neurites. It appeared as small spots in neurites and perikarya; however, the staining was more diffuse in the perinuclear region. Dynamin I immunoreactivity (red fluorescence) also had a spotty appearance and involved all neurites and perikarya. Confocal microscopy showed that the distribution of the two proteins overlapped within several regions: in the Golgi area (Fig. 7A) at the emergence of neurites from the cell body, where the dynamin labeling however spread closer to the cell surface than the phocein labeling (Fig. 7, A1 and B2) and within neurites (Fig. 7, A1, B1, and B2). Co-localization was observed at Banker's stage 3 in growth cones (Fig. 7, A2). Immunolabeling of NDPK in these neurons revealed the presence of the protein in all subcellular compartments, nucleus, soma and neurites, down to the smallest branches (not shown). Phocein was isolated previously as a partner of the members of the striatin family. Based on its homology to the ς-subunit of adaptor proteins, its subcellular localization, and its sensitivity to brefeldin A, phocein was proposed to be involved in vesicular traffic (1Baillat G. Moqrich A. Castets F. Baude A. Bailly Y. Benmerah A. Monneron A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified two novel binding partners for phocein, NDPK and Eps15. Both proteins have been implicated in membrane traffic, further strengthening a potential role of phocein in membrane dynamics. More specifically, all these proteins appear to be part of a protein network, which also includes dynamin. As demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, phocein directly interacts with NDPK. NDPKs are ubiquitous enzymes that participate in a variety of cell processes and appear to be important in the supply of local pools of GTP (for example, in the cytoplasm near the cell surface, where a large number of GTPases operate (19Kikkawa S.

A. 2001; 98: 4385-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)). Among them, dynamins are GTPases that play an essential role in the fission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane and are also implicated in other steps of intracellular vesicular trafficking (reviewed in Refs. 23Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 24Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Sci. 2000; 25: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although in the case of most GTPases, GTP binding is controlled by guanyl-nucleotide exchange factors, it appears that for dynamins, GTP loading is primarily dependent upon the local concentration of substrate, thus explaining the dependence of dynamin activity on NDPK. Dynamins are endowed with very low affinity for GTP, yet they have particularly high intrinsic (1–2 min−1) and stimulated (over 100 min−1) rates of GTP hydrolysis (24Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar,26Hill E. van der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Smythe E. J.

Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Based on copurification experiments, Shpetner and Vallee (28Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were the first to consider a possible role for NDPK in dynamin function. Recently, genetic studies conducted in Drosophila by Krishnan et al. (10Krishnan K.S. Rikhy R. Rao S. Shivalkar M. Mosko M. Narayanan R. Etter P. Estes P.S. Ramaswami M. Neuron. 2001; 30: 197-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) have shown that the activity of NDPK is critically required for the function of dynamin at synapses. They suggested that NDPK ‘transiently associates with dynamin, thus being optimally positioned to provide a very high local concentration of soluble GTP.‘ However, using fly heads and techniques such as coimmunolocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, or pull-down experiments, they did not find physical evidence for such an association. The present study provides a clear indication that mammalian dynamin and NDPK physically interact. Dynamin is present throughout the cell (29Noda Y. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Powell K.A. Robinson P.J. Neuroscience. 1995; 64: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and is particularly concentrated in nerve terminals (31Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 32McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5443-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phocein, according to our previous immunocytochemical data (1Baillat G. Moqrich A. Castets F. Baude A. Bailly Y. Benmerah A. Monneron A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), is found in the perikaryal-dendritic region of neurons, down to the spines, whereas in non-neuronal cells, it localizes predominantly in the Golgi complex. By contrast, within neurons, immunoreactivity for NDPK is diffuse and ubiquitous. NDPK is thus present in the subcellular regions where phocein and dynamin are expressed, in agreement with their partial association in brain extracts. The distributions of phocein and dynamin partially overlap in neurons, as well as in unpolarized cultured cells, in which dynamin isoforms are indeed detected at the level of the Golgi complex (34Jones S.M. Howell K.E. Henley J.R. Cao H. McNiven M.A. Science. 1998; 279: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 35Cao H. Thompson H.M. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1993-2002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within neurons, phocein may be implicated in only a subset of the reactions assisted by dynamin I, more specifically in reactions that occur in dendrites. The other phocein partner identified in the yeast two-hybrid assay, Eps15, has been implicated at several steps of the endocytic pathway. Eps15 is a major, regulated binding protein for the clathrin adaptor AP-2. Its enrichment at the neck of clathrin-coated pits, as determined by immunogold cytochemistry, has suggested a function somehow interconnected with the action of dynamin (8Benmerah A. Begue B.

Cell. 1999; 10: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is selectively blocked when Eps15 function is perturbed by antibody or peptide microinjection or by the expression of constructs that function by dominant negative interference (Ref. 39Lamaze C.

Interestingly, Salcini et al. (11Salcini A.E. Hilliard M.A. Croce A. Arbucci S. Luzzi C. Tacchetti C. Daniell L., De Camilli P. Pelicci P.G., Di Fiore P.P. Bazzicalupo P. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) very recently showed that mammalian Eps15 and dynamin genetically and biochemically interact, both in vitro and in vivo. Phocein is thus a part of the multiprotein complexes comprising NDPK, Eps15, dynamin, and the proteins of the striatin family (2Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.-V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A.

Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). That these complexes are bulky has been shown by gel filtration and sucrose gradient centrifugation (1Baillat G. Moqrich A. Castets F. Baude A. Bailly Y. Benmerah A. Monneron A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Blotted immunoprecipitates obtained by antibodies directed against phocein can be sequentially shown to contain all these proteins. However, the analyzed immunoprecipitates are a mixture of complexes; as a result, it is not possible to know whether these proteins all coexist within one given complex at the same time. Nevertheless, even if phocein interacts with these proteins in a sequential manner, such results are clearly in favor of a likely role of phocein in vesicular trafficking, particularly endocytosis. Yet how do these interactions occur? In both its N- and C-terminal domains, phocein has homology to the ς-subunits of AP membrane adaptors and thus might be components of AP complexes. Preliminary experiments indicate that γ- and α-adaptins, respectively, components of the AP1 and AP2 adaptors, coimmunoprecipitate with phocein even in rather harsh conditions. The finding that γ-adaptin coimmunoprecipitates with phocein is consistent with the localization of phocein at the Golgi complex (1Baillat G. Moqrich A. Castets F. Baude A. Bailly Y. Benmerah A. Monneron A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Likewise, coimmunoprecipitation of α-adaptin with phocein is consistent with a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Availability of antibodies directed against various adaptor subunits should help clarify whether phocein could actually be part of stable tetrameric adaptor complexes. Phocein, however, may exist independently of known AP subunits. Phocein has a central domain containing a putative Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding motif not conserved in ς-subunits. Another protein, stonin 2, which has homology to the μ-subunit of AP adaptors, is not found in tetrameric complexes (40Martina J.A. Bonangelino C.J. Aguilar R.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Whatever the way through which phocein is inserted within these NDPK, Eps15, dynamin, and striatin-containing complexes, phocein could help localize and/or stabilize their association. Since phocein has been shown to be a substrate of the protein phosphatase 2A, it is likely that some of its interactions are regulated by its phosphorylation state (6Moreno C.S. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24253-24260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The multimodular WD repeat-containing and calmodulin-binding proteins that constitute the striatin family are likely to play scaffolding and Ca2+-dependent signaling roles. Phocein, their major interactor, which also interacts with proteins involved in vesicular trafficking, could be involved in the cross-talk between endocytosis and signaling; growing evidence is now documented for this cross-talk (41Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Cell. 2001; 106: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).

All of these parasitic protozoa have in common that they lack the ubiquitous glutathione/glutathione reductase system but have a trypanothione [bis(glutathionyl)spermidine]/trypanothione reductase system instead (8Fairlamb A.H.

Med. 1999; 27: 966-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, trypanosomes do not have catalase and classical selenocysteine-glutathione peroxidase. Their known sensitivity toward oxidative stress renders the enzymes of the trypanothione metabolism attractive targets for a rational drug development (9Krauth-Siegel R.L. Coombs G. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Initially tryparedoxin was isolated from the insect parasite Crithidia fasciculata (1Gommel D.U. Nogoceke E. Morr M. Kiess M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but the protein occurs also in the pathogenic trypanosomatids T. brucei (2Lüdemann H. Dormeyer M. Sticherling C. Stallmann D.

Its first elucidated role was as a component of a cascade composed of trypanothione, trypanothione reductase, tryparedoxin, and tryparedoxin peroxidase that catalyzes the detoxication of organic hydroperoxides in the parasites (1Gommel D.U.

Stallmann D. Follmann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein catalyzes the trypanothione-dependent reduction of ribonucleotide reductase during the parasite synthesis of DNA precursors (14Dormeyer M. Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10602-10606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the latter reaction, tryparedoxin thus can replace the well known thioredoxin and/or glutaredoxin systems in other organisms (5Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T. brucei also possesses a classical thioredoxin, but its concentration is unusually low (15Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7547-7552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A thioredoxin reductase has not been detected so far in any Trypanosomatid organism. Preliminary functional studies showed that tryparedoxin has properties intermediate between those of classical thioredoxins and glutaredoxins. Like thioredoxin, tryparedoxin shows a negligible activity in the GSH:hydroxyethyl disulfide transhydrogenation, a reaction characteristic for glutaredoxins (2Lüdemann H. Dormeyer M. Sticherling C. Stallmann D. Follmann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). With glutaredoxins tryparedoxin has in common that the physiological reductant is a nonprotein thiol. The three-dimensional structure of C. fasciculata tryparedoxin revealed a folding very similar to that of thioredoxins into a five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices (16Alphey M.S.

In particular the active site motif Cys40-Pro41-Pro42-Cys43is in a position homologous to that of the corresponding motif in thioredoxin. The side chain of Cys40 points out of the protein being accessible from the solvent; in contrast, Cys43 is much more buried. Cys40 is the catalytic residue interacting alternately with trypanothione and the protein substrate such as tryparedoxin peroxidase or ribonucleotide reductase. In all thioredoxin-like proteins the reactivity is determined by the p K value of the first cysteine residue in the C XXC motif as well as by the redox potential of the protein. The first thiol is the nucleophile that reacts with the respective substrate. Here we report on the catalytic activities, the determination of the p K value of Cys40, and the redox potential of T. brucei tryparedoxin. Two active site mutants, mimicking the motif of classical thioredoxins and glutaredoxins, respectively, were constructed and compared with the authentic protein. Trypanothione disulfide was purchased from Bachem.

Partially purified malate dehydrogenase from spinach was a kind gift of Dr. Hartmut Follmann (Universität Kassel) and was stored at −20 °C. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against recombinant T. brucei tryparedoxin were produced by Eurogentec. trypanothione [N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine] dithioerythritol high pressure liquid chromatography morpholinoethane sulfonic acid morpholinopropane sulfonic acid tryparedoxin In a total volume of 400 μl, 200 μmT. brucei tryparedoxin or E. coli thioredoxin was incubated with 20 mm NaBH4 in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, for 5 min at room temperature. HCl was added to destroy excess NaBH4, and the protein solutions were desalted on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Complete reduction of the proteins was confirmed by HPLC analysis as described below and by thiol determination with Ellman's reagent (19Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21618) Google Scholar). Carboxamidomethylation of tryparedoxin was carried out as described (14Dormeyer M. Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10602-10606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Carboxymethylated tryparedoxin was prepared by incubating 50 μmtryparedoxin with 1 mm DTE in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6. After adding 6 mm iodoacetic acid, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was stopped by excess DTE. To prepare tryparedoxin alkylated at both active site cysteines, the reaction was carried out in the presence of 6 m guanidinium chloride. The reaction mixtures contained in a total volume of 80 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5, 100 μm dehydroascorbate, 1 mm GSH, and 0.1–5.6 μmT. brucei tryparedoxin,E. coli glutaredoxin, and thioredoxin, respectively. Formation of ascorbate was followed at 25 °C (ε265 = 14,000 m−1 cm−1) in a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer (20Krauth-Siegel R.L. Lüdemann H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The protein-mediated activity was corrected for the spontaneous reaction rate. Reduction of 100 μmdehydroascorbate by 1 mm GSH was followed in the presence and absence of 2 μm tryparedoxin in a total volume of 80 μl of 0.1 m MOPS/NaOH (pH 6.0–7.5) and Tris/HCl (pH 8.0–8.5) containing 0.2 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA at 25 °C. In a total volume of 80 μl, the reaction mixtures contained 50 and 100 μm dehydroascorbate, respectively, in 100 mmpotassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5. The reaction was started by adding 5–50 μm T(SH)2, and formation of ascorbate was followed as described above. A second assay system contained 50 or 100 μm dehydroascorbate, 10 or 50 μm T(SH)2, 100 μm NADPH, 10 milliunits trypanothione reductase, and 1.1–3.3 μmT. brucei tryparedoxin. Partially purified malate dehydrogenase from spinach was freed of plant thioredoxins immediately before use. At 4 °C 2 ml of protein solution was applied onto a Sephadex G-50 column (1.2 cm × 89 cm) in 200 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. 4-ml fractions were collected, and the protein concentrations of the first 30 fractions were determined at 280 nm. Fractions containing more than 1 mg/ml protein were combined giving 32 ml of partially purified malate dehydrogenase with a protein concentration of 1.8 mg/ml. In a total volume of 800 μl of 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1–20 μmE. coli thioredoxin and glutaredoxin as well as T. brucei tryparedoxin and thioredoxin, respectively, were incubated with 10–80 μl of malate dehydrogenase solution and 5 mm DTE for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was started by adding 2.5 mm oxaloacetate and 0.2 mm NADPH, and the absorption decrease at 340 nm was followed in a Hitachi 150-20 spectrophotometer (21Braun H. Lichter A. Häberlein I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The WCPPC active site motif of tryparedoxin was altered into the sequence of classical thioredoxins (WCGPC) and glutaredoxins (WCPYC). For each mutant forward and reverse primers were derived covering the active site (thioredoxin-mutant: reverse, 5′-CCCCGGCATGGGCCGCACCAGGAGGC-3′, and forward, 5′-GGTGCGGCCCATGCCGGGGTTTTACACCGG-3′; glutaredoxin-mutant: reverse, 5′-CCCCGGCAATAGGGGCACCAGGAGGC-3′, and forward, 5′-CCCCTATTGCCGGGGTTTTACACCGGTCC-3′). The codons inducing the mutation are underlined. The primers overlapped by 15–19 base pairs. Three polymerase chain reactions were carried out with Pfu polymerase (at 95 °C for 2 min; 30 times at 95 °C for 1 min, at 55 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 1 min; and at 72 °C for 5 min). In the first amplification the respective active site reverse primer and an upstream pQE-60 vector primer (5′-GAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGAATTC-3′) were used. The second PCR was carried out with the active site forward primer and a primer corresponding to the 3′untranslated region directly following the stop codon (5′-AGATCTTCACAGACAGCATGGCATCTC-3′, with a BglII cleavage site underlined). The pQE-60 plasmid with the tryparedoxin coding region served as template. In the third PCR the two purified fragments were used together as template, and the complete tpx gene with the respective mutation was amplified with the 3′-end primer and the pQE-60 vector primer. The PCR fragments were purified, cloned into a pQE-60 vector, and completely sequenced in both directions. The mutant genes were expressed in the thioredoxin-deficient E. coli strain A 179, and the proteins were purified as described for authentic T. brucei tryparedoxin (2Lüdemann H. Dormeyer M. Sticherling C. Stallmann D. Follmann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CD spectra of wild type and mutant proteins were recorded on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter at the EMBL (Heidelberg, Germany) in collaboration with Drs. Manuela López de la Paz and Luis Serrano. The reaction mixture contained in a total volume of 80 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 100 μm NADPH, human thioredoxin reductase, and varying concentrations of T. brucei tryparedoxin and the mutants, respectively (5–30 μm). The absorption decrease at 340 nm was followed at 25 °C in a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer. The Km values of human thioredoxin reductase for the different T. brucei tryparedoxin species were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Relative maximum activities were determined because the available sample of human thioredoxin reductase was not homogeneous. The pH-dependent ionization of the cysteine 40 thiol was monitored by the absorbance of the thiolate anion at 240 nm (7Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Spectra of 10 μm reduced, oxidized, and carboxamidomethylated tryparedoxin were recorded between 200 and 400 nm at 25 °C in a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer. All of the measurements were carried out in a stoppered quartz cuvette that contained in a total volume of 1.3 ml of 10 μmtryparedoxin, 1 mm each citrate, borate, and phosphate, 0.2m KCl, pH 5.2, purged with argon. The pH value was adjusted with KOH and then raised in steps between pH 5.2 and 10 by adding defined volumes of 0.2 m KOH. The spectra were recorded against air and corrected for the dilution caused by the pH adjustment, and the spectra of the buffer solutions treated in the same way were subtracted. In the case of the glutaredoxin mutant, the solution was titrated between 5.2 and 7.05 with KOH and between 4.8 and 2.5 by adding HCl. 50 μm reduced tryparedoxin was incubated at 25 °C with 50 μm iodoacetic acid in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris, 10 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MOPS, 10 mm MES, 0.2 m KCl at pH values between 5.9 and 9.5 (7Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 22Kallis G.-B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After different times, the reaction was stopped by mixing 10 μl of the sample with 10 μl of 200 mm DTE. Reduced and carboxymethylated tryparedoxin were separated by HPLC on a C8-VYDAAC column (208TP5215) at 25 °C. The proteins were detected at 214 nm and eluted isocratically with 41% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The redox potential of T. brucei tryparedoxin was determined by direct protein-protein redox equilibration (23Åslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Different concentrations of reduced and oxidized tryparedoxin and E. coli thioredoxin in 100 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, were allowed to equilibrate for 4 h at 25 °C in a closed 1.5-ml reaction tube after purging the solution with argon. 5-μl samples were directly analyzed by HPLC on a C8-VYDAAC column (208TP5215). The proteins were eluted over 50 min by a gradient from 35.5 to 70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and 25 °C. In vitro activity of glutaredoxins (thioltransferases) is the ability to catalyze the reduction of dehydroascorbate by glutathione (24Washburn M.P. Wells W.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thioredoxins do not catalyze the reaction whereby a recent report shows that the mammalian thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system can reduce dehydroascorbate (25May J.M. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Because T. brucei tryparedoxin has properties intermediate between those of classical glutaredoxins and thioredoxins, we tested whether the parasite protein is able to accelerate the spontaneous reduction of dehydroascorbate by glutathione. The reaction was followed by measuring the formation of ascorbate. Because of the rapid nonenzymatic reduction of dehydroascorbate by GSH at higher pH values, the assays were performed at pH 6.5 (20Krauth-Siegel R.L. Lüdemann H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 100 μmdehydroascorbate, 1 mm glutathione, and varying concentrations of T. brucei tryparedoxin, E. coli glutaredoxin, and E. coli thioredoxin, respectively. 2 μm tryparedoxin catalyzed the formation of ascorbate with a rate of 0.09 μm min−1 (Fig. 1), which is 1 order of magnitude slower than the reaction mediated by 2 μmE. coli glutaredoxin (0.94 μm min−1). As expected,E. coli thioredoxin showed only marginal activity. Reduction of dehydroascorbate by glutathione is strongly dependent on the pH value. Between pH 6.5 and 7.5, the rate of the spontaneous reaction increases by about 1 order of magnitude. In contrast, the slight increase in the reaction rate in the presence of tryparedoxin remained constant. As shown previously, trypanothione reduces dehydroascorbate at pH 6.5 with a second order rate constant of 1300m−1 min−1 (20Krauth-Siegel R.L. Lüdemann H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction is 3 orders of magnitude faster than reduction by glutathione. A further acceleration of the reaction rate by tryparedoxin was not observed, in accordance with ascorbate being kept reduced by the spontaneous reaction with trypanothione. NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenases from plants are activated by a thiol/disulfide interchange with reduced thioredoxins. Reduction of oxaloacetate by partially purified malate dehydrogenase from spinach chloroplasts was followed in the presence of T. brucei tryparedoxin and T. brucei thioredoxin.E. coli thioredoxin, known to activate NADP-malate dehydrogenase and E. coli glutaredoxin, not catalyzing the reaction (Fig. 2), served as control. The preincubation mixture contained 5 mm DTE, which does not activate malate dehydrogenase directly but only serves to generate the reduced dithiol proteins in the assay (21Braun H. Lichter A. Häberlein I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the presence of T. brucei thioredoxin, spinach malate dehydrogenase showed a sigmoidal saturation curve, whereas E. coli thioredoxin yielded a Michaelis-Menten-type kinetic. The presence of both proteins resulted in identical maximum activities. T. brucei tryparedoxin activated the enzyme with a sigmoidal dependence on the protein concentration, but maximum activity was not achieved. The tryparedoxin concentration required for half-maximum activity was about an order of magnitude higher when compared with the thioredoxins. As expected, E. coli glutaredoxin failed to activate malate dehydrogenase. The finding that tryparedoxin and the two thioredoxins exert different degrees and types of activation is consistent with the reaction not being the simple reduction of malate dehydrogenase. Obviously specific complex formation between the dithiol protein and the enzyme is involved in the activation mechanism (21Braun H. Lichter A. Häberlein I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A thorough study on spinach and soybean NADP-malate dehydrogenase showed that the activation and activity of the enzymes strongly depend on the individual thioredoxin, with the kinetics varying from Michaelis-Menten-type to different sigmoidal kinetics (21Braun H. Lichter A. Häberlein I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two active site mutants of T. brucei tryparedoxin were constructed corresponding to the motif of classical thioredoxins (CGPC) and glutaredoxins (CPYC), respectively. The mutant genes were overexpressed in thioredoxin-deficient E. coli as described for wild type tryparedoxin (2Lüdemann H. Dormeyer M. Sticherling C. Stallmann D. Follmann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). 20 mg of pure protein was obtained per liter bacterial cell culture, the yield being comparable with wild type tryparedoxin. Correct folding of the mutant proteins was examined by CD spectroscopy. The shape of the spectra was very similar to that of authentic tryparedoxin (not shown). Calculating the ratios of the mean residue ellipticity values at 208 and 222 nm as well as at 217 and 206 nm yielded identical values, indicating the same content of α-helices and β-sheets in the three protein species. Mammalian thioredoxin reductases show a broad substrate specificity accepting thioredoxins from different species. T. brucei tryparedoxin is reduced by human thioredoxin reductase with a Kmvalue of 43.5 μm (Table I), which is comparable with the Km values of 20 and 6 μm for E. coli and T. brucei thioredoxin, respectively (15Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7547-7552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Changing the active site motif into that of thioredoxin lowered the Km value to 17.4 μm but also decreased the reaction rate. The mutant with the WCPYC sequence of glutaredoxin was also a substrate for human thioredoxin reductase with a very high Km value of 200 μm but with a concomitantly increased activity. The simultaneous increase/decrease of the Km value and the activity resulted in catalytic efficiencies for the two mutants only 30–40% lower than that of wild type tryparedoxin.Table IKinetic parameters for the reduction of different T. brucei tryparedoxin species by human thioredoxin reductaseTryparedoxin speciesActive site motifKmVmaxRelative efficiencyμM%%Wild typeCPPC43.5100100Thioredoxin mutantCGPC17.42870Glutaredoxin mutantCPYC20026858The assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the kinetic data were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots.

The values given are the means of two independent measurements that varied by less than 5%. Cys40 is the N-terminal cysteine residue in the WCPPC active site motif of tryparedoxins (1Gommel D.U.

Krauth-Siegel R.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thioredoxins (CGPC), glutaredoxins (CPYC), and DsbA (CPHC) share similar sequences (26Chivers P.T. Prehoda K.E. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4061-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In any case, the first cysteine is the nucleophile that is responsible for the reactivity of the thiol disulfide oxidoreductases. To get an insight in the molecular basis of the distinct properties of tryparedoxin, the p K value of Cys40 was determined by two independent methods. The absorption spectrum of reduced T. brucei tryparedoxin was monitored between 200 and 400 nm in the pH range 5–10 (Fig. 3). Because many other groups in a protein also absorb in this region, the spectra of oxidized tryparedoxin and the protein carboxamidomethylated at Cys40were recorded for comparison. All spectra overlapped except for the region between 240 and 270 nm where reduced tryparedoxin showed a significant absorption increase with rising pH. Fig. 4 gives the ε values at 240, 288, and 295 nm as a function of pH for the three protein species. Changes at 240 nm reflect ionization of thiols, at 288 nm unfolding, and at 295 nm tyrosine ionization (7Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). At 288 and 295 nm, the coefficients of the three proteins were almost identical and independent of the pH. The proteins were stable between pH 2.5 and 4.8 and between 5.3 and 9.6. At pH 5.0, the solubility of tryparedoxin was drastically diminished probably because of its isoelectric point, the theoretical value being 5.06. At high pH values, the ε240 values of oxidized and alkylated tryparedoxin slightly increased in parallel. In contrast, the ε240 value of reduced tryparedoxin yielded a sigmoidal dependence on the pH value. The concentration of the thiolate anion was calculated using an absorption coefficient ε240 nm of 4.000 m−1 cm−1 (7Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974"

We have produced recombinant human M2BP fragments comprising domains 1 and 2 (M2BP-1,2) and domains 3 and 4 (M2BP-3,4) in 293 human kidney cells to characterize structural and functional properties of M2BP. Both fragments were obtained in a native and glycosylated form, as analyzed by CD spectroscopy, trypsin susceptibility, and enzymatic deglycosylation. These results strongly suggest that both fragments are autonomous folding units. All three potentialN-glycosylation sites in M2BP-1,2 and all four in M2BP-3,4 were found to be occupied. M2BP-1,2 expressed in tunicamycin-treated cells contained no glycosyl residues, indicating thatO-glycosylation is not occurring. Ultracentrifugation revealed that M2BP-1,2 is homogeneously dimeric in the nanomolar range reflecting the properties of intact M2BP. Domain 2 (BTB/POZ domain) is thus identified as the dimerization domain of M2BP, because it has been formerly shown that recombinant domain 1 is monomeric. M2BP-3,4 showed a concentration-dependent self-association, and aggregates of different size and shape were shown by electron microscopy. In contrast to this irregular aggregation of M2BP-3,4, it has been formerly shown that a fragment comprising domains 2–4 still has the ability to form ring-like structures, although the rings are protein-filled, and thus domain 2 appears to be indispensable for ring formation. Solid phase assays showed that M2BP-3,4 contains binding sites for galectin-3, nidogen, and collagens V and VI, whereas M2BP-1,2 is inactive in binding. Both fragments showed no cell adhesive activity in contrast to native M2BP, suggesting that a concerted binding action and/or multivalent interactions of rings are necessary for cell attachment.

Mouse cyclophilin C-associated protein is 69% identical to M2BP, and it seems likely that the two proteins are functional homologues. Gene-targeted cyclophilin C-associated protein-deficient mice are viable but show an up-regulation of the endotoxin and proinflammatory response (7Trahey M. Weissman I.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3006-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). M2BP is extensively glycosylated and interacts with galectin-3 (former name Mac-2), and it also interacts with other extracellular proteins such as collagens IV, V, and VI, fibronectin, and nidogen (1Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 2Koths K. Taylor E. Halenbeck R. Casipit C. Wang A. J. Biol.

M2BP binds to galectin-3 on the cell surface and induces homotypic cell aggregation (10Inohara H. Akahani S. Koths K. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4530-4534PubMed Google Scholar). β1-Integrin-mediated cell adhesion to M2BP was also demonstrated (1Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Tissue extracted and recombinant M2BP form linear and ring-shaped oligomers. Investigation by scanning transmission electron microscopy showed that the ring oligomers are comprised of ∼14-nm-long segments composed of two 92-kDa M2BP monomers (11Muller S.A. Sasaki T. Bork P. Wolpensinger B. Schulthess T. Timpl R. Engel A. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the rings vary in size, decamers predominate. The various linear oligomers and dimers are probably ring precursors. It is hypothesized that the multivalency of M2BP provided by its assembly to ring-like structures is of decisive importance for the linkage of different components and for an increase in binding activity. M2BP consists of 567 residues after cleavage of the signal peptide (2Koths K. Taylor E. Halenbeck R. Casipit C. Wang A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14245-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5Ullrich A. Sures I. D'Egidio M. Jallal B. Powell T.J. Herbst R. Dreps A. Azam M. Rubinstein M. Natoli C. Shawver L.K.

Sasaki T. Bork P. Wolpensinger B. Schulthess T. Timpl R. Engel A. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Domain 1 at the N terminus is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain family (2Koths K. Taylor E. Halenbeck R. Casipit C. Wang A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14245-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ullrich A. Sures I. D'Egidio M. Jallal B. Powell T.J. Herbst R. Dreps A. Azam M. Rubinstein M. Natoli C. Shawver L.K.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Domains 2 and 3 are putative members of the BTB (broad complex, tramtrack, andbric-a-brac)/POZ (poxvirus and zinc finger) and IVR domain family, respectively. In several proteins, BTB/POZ domains have been shown to mediate homodimerization or multimerization (see Ref. 13Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar for review). No convincing similarity with other proteins was detected for the C-terminal putative domain 4. Recombinant domain 1 (M2BP-1) is monomeric and is inactive in binding to extracellular matrix ligands and in cell attachment. A fragment consisting of putative domains 2–4 (M2BP-2,3,4) aggregates to heterogeneous, protein-filled ring-like structures and retains the potential for binding to extracellular matrix ligands and for cell adhesion (11Muller S.A. Sasaki T. Bork P. Wolpensinger B. Schulthess T. Timpl R. Engel A. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study we have produced recombinant M2BP fragments consisting of domains 1 and 2 (M2BP-1,2) and domains 3 and 4 (M2BP-3,4) to further characterize the function of the different domains. Both fragments were obtained in native and glycosylated forms, suggesting that they are autonomous folding units. All putativeN-glycosylation sites are occupied, but there are some modifications in the glycan moieties compared with the parent protein. We show that domain 2 (BTB/POZ domain) is the dimerization domain of M2BP. M2BP-3,4 shows self-association but cannot form ring structures in the absence of domain 2. Binding studies in vitrodemonstrated binding sites for extracellular matrix ligands in M2BP-3,4, in contrast to M2BP-1,2. Both fragments are inactive in cell attachment, suggesting that concerted action of several binding sites in both fragments and/or multivalent interactions of rings is necessary for cell adhesion. The full-length human M2BP cDNA sequence in the pCEP-Pu vector (1Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) was used as a PCR template to generate the cDNA constructs encoding human M2BP-1,2 and M2BP-3,4. Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the domain borders 19 and 254 for M2BP-1,2 and 250 and 585 for M2BP-3,4 were used. Primers were constructed to code for a N-terminal His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site. Primers used for the M2BP-1,2 protein were GATCGCTAGCTCACCACCATCATCACCACCTGGTTCCGCGTGGTTCTGTGAACGATGGTGACATGCGG and GATCGGATCCTTAGTCCTGGGGGAGGAGGATGG for the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Primers used for the M2BP-3,4 protein were GATCGCTAGCTCACCACCATCATCACCACCTGGTTCCGCGTGGTTCTCTCCTCCCCCAGGACCCCTC and GATCGGATCCTTAGTCCACACCTGAGGAGTTGGTC for the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Sequences were verified by dye terminator cycle sequencing. They were inserted into the episomal expression vector pCEP-Pu (14Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) in frame to the BM-40 signal peptide and used for the episomal transfection of human embryonic kidney cells that express the EBNA-1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBNA-293 cells). Transfectants were selected with 2–10 μg/ml puromycin. Serum-free medium collected from cultures was centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min and stored at −20 °C. To the harvested medium Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 (final concentration, 20 mm), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 mm EDTA (final concentrations)) were added, and the medium was passed through a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filter. The solution was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA and passed over a column of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with 500 mm NaCl and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mmimidazole, pH 7.9. The proteins were further purified by nickel-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. Removal of the His6 tag by treatment with thrombin was not successful. In the case of M2BP-1,2, which is stable to limited trypsin digestion, the His6 tag was cleaved with trypsin (5 units/μmol of recombinant protein) for 30 min at room temperature. Trypsin and the cleaved His6 tag fragments were removed by passing the solution over a column of aprotinin-Sepharose (Sigma) and nickel-Sepharose, respectively. Transfected cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.1–10 μg of tunicamycin/ml of medium at 37 °C for 36 h before analysis of the expressed recombinant proteins. For protein purification, the cells were incubated in the presence of 3.3 μg of tunicamycin/ml of serum-free medium, and cell supernatants were selected every second day for 6 days. The protein samples (2–40 μm) were incubated with 5 units of trypsin/μmol of protein at 22 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence or absence of 150 mm NaCl. The reactions were stopped after 1 h by incubating the sample in SDS buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (15Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and silver staining. An Aviv 62DS circular dichroism spectropolarimeter was used with thermostated 1-mm quartz cuvettes. Each spectrum was the average of four scans and was corrected for the buffer contribution. The buffers used were 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline). The molar ellipticity (in degrees × cm2/dmol) was calculated on the basis of a mean residue molecular mass of 110 Da. A Beckman model XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorption optics was employed. Sedimentation velocity runs were performed in 12-mm double sector cells at 54,000 rpm for M2BP-1,2 and 44,000 rpm for M2BP-3,4. Sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed using the same cells but at a filling height of 1.5–3 mm only. Rotor speeds were adapted to the different molecular masses: 16,000–17,000 rpm for M2BP-1,2 and 5,200 rpm for M2BP-3,4. The measurements were performed at 20 °C. The molecular masses were calculated from sedimentation equilibrium runs using a floating base-line computer program that adjusts the base-line absorbance to obtain the best linear fit of ln A versus r2 (A = absorbance, r = distance from the rotor axis). Partial specific volumes of 0.73 cm3/g for nonglycosylated M2BP-1,2 and 0.70 cm3/g for glycosylated M2BP-1,2 and M2BP-3,4 were used for the calculations. The latter value is calculated for proteins with 30% weight glycosylation (16Ralston G. Introduction to Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Beckman Instruments, Fullerston, CA1993Google Scholar). The Sedimentation coefficients were corrected to standard conditions (water at 20 °C). Electron microscopy by the rotary shadowing technique was performed as described (17Engel J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein (20–30 μg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, was mixed with an equal volume of glycerol and sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica discs. These were dried in high vacuum, rotary shadowed with platinum/carbon at an angle of 9 °, and replicated. A solid phase assay with plastic-immobilized ligands and soluble M2BP proteins was performed as described (1Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The concentration of the polyclonal anti-M2BP antiserum (1:300) used in the solid phase assays was adjusted to result in a similar binding activity to the same protein amounts of M2BP-1,2, M2BP-3,4, and full-length M2BP. Full-length M2BP for the solid phase assays was recombinantly expressed in EBNA-293 cells and purified as described (1Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The cell adhesion assay as well as the cell lines used have been described previously (1Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Treatment of 10 μg of native M2BP-1,2 or M2BP-3,4 with 4–10 milliunits of neuraminidase or with a mixture of 2–10 milliunits of neuraminidase, 10–60 milliunits of endoglycosidase F, and 0.3–5.5 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was done at 37 °C for 1–5 days in 20–100 mm sodium or potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. In the case of the longer incubation times, the enzymes were renewed two times during the incubation period. Treatment of 10 μg of denatured M2BP-1,2 or M2BP-3,4 with 2 milliunits of neuraminidase, 2.5 milliunits of O-glycosidase, or 4 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was done at 37 °C for 20 h in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 0.5% octylglucoside and 0.1% SDS. The denaturation before the incubation with the enzymes was done by heating at 97 °C for 5 min in the presence of 1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were hydrolyzed with 3m HCl (110 °C, 16 h) for the determination of hexosamine compositions on a LC 3000 analyzer (Biotronik). Mass spectral data were acquired between 200 and 2000 Da on a Finnigan TSQ7000 mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San José, CA) set at single unit resolution; the molecular masses of the proteins were calculated from the raw spectrum with the biochemistry applications software provided by the manufacturer. Protein concentrations of M2BP-1,2 and M2BP-3,4 were determined spectroscopically by absorbance at 280 nm, using molar extinction coefficients of 30,075 and 80,580m−1 cm−1 predicted from the amino acid sequences (18Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) or by Tricine-SDS-PAGE according to Schagger and von Jagow (15Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). The proteins in SDS gels were silver-stained as described (20Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the proteins were chromatographed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BA85, Schleicher & Schüll), and probed with 1:10,000 diluted anti-M2BP antiserum (1Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) using the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) to visualize bound secondary antibody on x-ray films. Fragments consisting of domains 1 and 2 (M2BP-1,2; residues 19–254) and of domains 3 and 4 (M2BP-3,4; residues 250–585) were prepared according to the predicted domain boundaries for human M2BP (11Muller S.A. Sasaki T. Bork P. Wolpensinger B. Schulthess T. Timpl R. Engel A. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). cDNAs were produced by PCR amplification to code for a N-terminal His6 tag. Episomal expression vectors containing the BM-40 signal peptide sequence were constructed to express the recombinant proteins in EBNA-293 kidney cells. Both fragments were secreted and detectable by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1A). A polyclonal antiserum against recombinant full-length M2BP (1Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) specifically recognized both M2BP fragments in crude culture medium (Fig. 1B). Column chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and nickel-Sepharose resulted in homogeneous proteins (Fig. 1C) with yields of 10–30 μg/ml of culture medium. The apparent molecular mass of the proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1) was larger than the one calculated from the protein sequence (35–42 kDa as compared with 27.4 kDa for M2BP-1,2 and 50–60 kDa as compared with 40.0 kDa for M2BP-3,4), indicating glycosylation. In addition, the proteins appeared as diffuse bands rather than as sharp bands in the gels, indicating heterogeneity in the oligosaccharide moieties. Hexosamine analyses demonstrated on average 12 residues of glucosamine per M2BP-1,2 monomer and 19 residues of glucosamine and 1 residue of galactosamine per M2BP-3,4 monomer. Fig. 2A shows that treatment of the purified proteins in their denatured form with neuraminidase resulted in small decreases of apparent molar mass (Fig. 2A,lanes 2). By treatment with N-glycosidase F shifts were much larger, and sharp protein bands were obtained, indicating apparent molecular masses close to the calculated ones (Fig.2A, lanes 3). No further shift in mobility was observed after including O-glycosidase in the digestion mix (data not shown).Figure 2Susceptibility of M2BP-1 ,2 and M2BP-3 ,4 to neuraminidase and N-glycosidase F and inhibition of glycosylation of M2BP-1 ,2 by tunicamycin. A, purified M2BP-1,2 or M2BP-3,4 were denatured and then treated with either buffer only (control incubation, lane 1), neuraminidase (lane 2), or N-glycosidase F (lane 3) at 37 °C for 20 h. The samples (1 μg of protein) were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and the bands were visualized by silver staining.B, transfected EBNA-293 cells that express M2BP-1,2 were incubated with serum-free culture medium in the presence of 0.1% (CH3)2SO (control incubation, lane 1) or with 0.1 μg/ml (lane 2), 1 μg/ml (lane 3), or 10 μg/ml (lane 4) tunicamycin at 37 °C for 36 h. Secreted proteins from the medium were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and the bands were visualized by silver staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Treatment of M2BP-1,2 expressing EBNA-293 cells with tunicamycin, which inhibits N-glycosylation, resulted in a size reduction of the secreted M2BP-1,2 (Fig. 2B) very similar to that of the purified protein after digestion with N-glycosidase F (Fig.2A, left lane 3). 0.1 μg/ml of tunicamycin resulted in a partial inhibition of N-glycosylation (Fig.2B, lane 2), whereas 1 μg/ml or higher concentrations of tunicamycin inhibited N-glycosylation completely (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Application of this method to M2BP-3,4 was not successful, and addition of tunicamycin stopped expression (data not shown), probably because of misfolding and degradation. M2BP-1,2 and M2BP-3,4 contain three and four potentialN-glycosylation sites, respectively (2Koths K. Taylor E. Halenbeck R. Casipit C. Wang A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14245-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ullrich A. Sures I. D'Egidio M. Jallal B. Powell T.J. Herbst R. Dreps A. Azam M. Rubinstein M. Natoli C. Shawver L.K. Schlessinger J. Iacobelli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18401-18407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether all of these sites are glycosylated, native M2BP fragments were partially deglycosylated with a glycosidase mixture containing neuraminidase, N-glycosidase F, and endoglycosidase F (Fig.3). This experiment resulted in two and three intermediate protein bands for M2BP-1,2 and M2BP-3,4, respectively (Fig. 3, lanes 3), in contrast to treatment with neuraminidase only (Fig. 3, lanes 2) and with quantitative cleavage of all N-linked glycans by deglycosylation of the proteins in their denatured form (Fig. 3,lanes 4). The stepwise removal of N-glycans suggests that all three potential N-glycosylation sites in M2BP-1,2 and all four sites in M2BP-3,4 are occupied. Resistance to protease digestion of correctly folded domains is a common probe for proper folding of recombinant fragments (21Specks U. Mayer U. Nischt R. Spissinger T. Mann K. Timpl R. Engel J. Chu M.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4281-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). After trypsin incubation (5 units of trypsin/μmol of recombinant protein), M2BP-1,2 undergoes only a very slight reduction of its molecular size in SDS-PAGE (data not shown), which is due to the cleavage of the N-terminal His6 tag at the thrombin cleavage site that was introduced between the His6 tag and the M2BP-1,2 protein sequence (removal of the tag by treatment with thrombin turned out to be unsuccessful). Microsequencing showed that the cleaved protein started with the N-terminal sequence GSVND, with the GS being derived from the foreign thrombin cleavage region. M2BP-1,2 from tunicamycin-treated EBNA-293 cells, which contain noN-glycans, was also stable to trypsin digestion, but 10-fold less trypsin was required for cleavage of the His6 tag. Stability to limited proteolysis of the latter protein indicates that the structural organization in M2BP-1,2 is responsible for this property rather than a protection effect by the glycan moieties. This protein was analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy. The molecular mass before cleavage of the His tag was 27,412.0 Da (calculated mass of the nonreduced protein, 27,416.8 Da) and after cleavage of the His tag was 25,769.0 Da (calculated mass of the nonreduced protein, 25,775.9 Da). The agreement between measured and calculated molar masses shows that the protein does not contain any glycosyl residues. The result also proves that the protein is notO-glycosylated in EBNA-293 cells nor does it contain any other posttranslational modification. Treatment of M2BP-3,4 with trypsin completely converted the protein into two bands of 27 and 35 kDa in SDS-PAGE (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing revealed the two sequences APLAH and GSLLP for the 35-kDa band and the sequence YSSDY for the 27-kDa band. The 35-kDa band thus consists of the N-terminal domain 3 with and without His6 tag, whereas the 27-kDa band consists of the C-terminal domain 4 starting at position 442 of native M2BP. This result is consistent with the finding of several protease cleavage sites within the putative linker region between domains 3 and 4, which have been demonstrated with plasmin and a not identified endogenous protease from human breast carcinoma cells SK-BR-3 (1Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 2Koths K. Taylor E. Halenbeck R. Casipit C. Wang A. J. Biol.

Plasmin has been shown to cleave full-length M2BP from EBNA-293 cells into a 67-kDa N-terminal fragment and the 26-kDa C-terminal domain 4 starting at positions 442 and 455 (1Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The former N terminus is the same as the one of domain 4 released from M2BP-3,4 by trypsin. Full-length M2BP from SK-BR-3 cells has been shown to be cleaved by an endogenous protease into a 70-kDa N-terminal fragment and the 27 kDa C-terminal domain 4 starting at position 437 (2Koths K. Taylor E. Halenbeck R. Casipit C. Wang A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14245-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conformational state of M2BP-1,2 and M2BP-3,4 was analyzed by circular dichroism (Fig. 4). The CD spectrum of M2BP-1,2 shows a dichroic minimum at 209 nm. A nearly identical spectrum was obtained for unglycosylated M2BP-1,2 from tunicamycin-treated cells (data not shown). M2BP-3,4 showed dichroic minima at 209 and 222 nm. The CD spectra demonstrate the presence of α-helical and β-structures in both proteins but with a higher α-helical content in M2BP-3,4. The spectra thus indicate that the proteins are in a native state. An analysis of different proportions of secondary structure appeared to be of little use because both proteins may consist of two rather different domains. Analytical ultracentrifugation was used for the analysis of the oligomeric state of the recombinant proteins (Table I). M2BP-1,2 sedimented with a single sharp profile and a sedimentation coefficient of 4.3 S, and sedimentation equilibrium yielded a molecular mass of 70 kDa. The data indicate a dimeric state of glycosylated M2BP-1,2, which runs on SDS gels with a molecular mass of 35–42 kDa in the monomeric form (Fig. 1C). The frictional ratiof/f0 = 1.2 suggests a globular shape of the dimer, which can be approximated by an ellipsoid of revolution with an axial ratio of 2. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a broad range of protein concentrations (3–15 μm), but even at the lowest concentrations near the meniscus of the cells (1 μm) no indication for dissociat"
https://openalex.org/W2063940468,"SRC family kinases have been consistently and recurrently implicated in neurite extension events, yet the mechanism underlying their neuritogenic role has remained elusive. We report that epidermal growth factor (EGF) can be converted from a non-neuritogenic into a neuritogenic factor through moderate activation of endogenous SRC by receptor-protein-tyrosine phosphatase α (a physiological SRC activator). We show that such a qualitative change in the response to EGF is not accompanied by changes in the extent or kinetics of ERK induction in response to this factor. Instead, the pathway involved relies on increased tyrosine phosphorylation of, and recruitment of Crk to, the SRC substrate Sin/Efs. The latter is a scaffolding protein structurally similar to the SRC substrate Cas, tyrosine phosphorylation of which is critical for migration in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Expression of a dominant negative version of Sin interfered with receptor-protein-tyrosine phosphatase α/EGF- as well as fibroblast growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth. These observations uncouple neuritogenic signaling in PC12 cells from sustained activation of ERK kinases and for the first time identify an effector of SRC function in neurite extension.

The neuritogenic effect of constitutively active MEK has been taken to indicate that ERK activation is also sufficient for neuritogenesis. Yet, physiological ERK activation, e.g. in response to EGF, often does not engender neurite extension. An attempt to resolve this paradox has been the postulate that the kinetic pattern of ERK signaling after a stimulus is what dictates the nature of the ensuing response (1Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4209) Google Scholar). In this view, “sustained” activation of ERK (hours), such as typically seen for FGF or NGF, would be the signal that specifies a neuritogenic outcome as opposed to the “transient” (<1 h) ERK induction associated with non-neuritogenic factors such as EGF. However, such a correlation does not necessarily imply sufficiency or necessity. extracellular signal-regulated kinase epidermal growth factor fibroblast growth factor nerve growth factor protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SRC family kinase wild type extracellular signal-regulated kinase epidermal growth factor fibroblast growth factor nerve growth factor protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SRC family kinase wild type Diverse and independent approaches have exposed the necessity of postulating pathways to process formation other than ERK. Recurrently, tyrosine kinases of the SRC family (SFKs) have been proposed as candidates for such “parallel pathways.” A mutation in Trk retains ERK induction but abolishes neurite outgrowth by NGF (2Peng X. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Analysis of platelet-derived growth factor receptor mutants showed that sustained ERK activation per se is insufficient but that neuritogenesis requires additional signals possibly involving SRC (3Vaillancourt R.R.

This crucial role of SFKs in neurite extension is not restricted to PC12 cells but is equally clearly encountered in conditionally immortalized (7Kuo W.L. Chung K.C. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell.

SFKs associate with adhesion molecules that facilitate process elongation (10Beggs H.E. Baragona S.C. Hemperly J.J. Maness P.F. J. Biol.

Lohse K. Mikule K. Wood M.R. Pfenninger K.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2465-2475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fibroblasts and epithelial cells, SRC is intimately implicated in phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, turnover of these structures, and cell motility (13Boyer B. Roche S. Denoyelle M. Thiery J.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5904-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). v-SRC can activate or inhibit ERK kinases, depending on the cell type and stage of transformation (15Stofega M.R. Yu C.L. Wu J. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 113-119PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hakak Y. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6953-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Its action as a transforming oncogene can be separated from its ability to activate Ras and ERK (17Aftab D.T. Kwan J. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By contrast, in neuronal cells, the identity of signaling steps downstream of c-SRC has remained obscure. One reason for this lack of progress has been the previous extensive reliance on mutationally activated v-SRC. Given the drastic degree of kinase activation and deregulation of the latter, this approach has not been informative regarding the function of endogenous c-SRC. Indeed, the signaling pathways downstream of oncogenic and cellular SRC proteins were recently shown to differ substantially; for instance, c-SRC-mediated activation of certain promoters relies exclusively on Rap1, whereas transforming SRC alleles also signal through Ras (24Xing L., Ge, C. Zeltser R. Maskevitch G. Mayer B.J. Alexandropoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7363-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Approaches using oncogenic SRC alleles are particularly compromised by the experimental difficulty of separating the biological effect of mutationally activated v-SRC from its ability to deregulate ERK kinases (15Stofega M.R. Yu C.L. Wu J. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 113-119PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hakak Y. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6953-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SFKs are regulated by a conformational mechanism that is controlled by phosphorylation. Intramolecular interactions between the SH2 domain and a C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation site (Tyr-527 in chicken SRC) in combination with SH3-mediated interactions stabilize a kinase-inactive conformation (25Schwartzberg P.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In consequence, wild type SRC family kinases are reversibly activated in situ by ligands to their SH2 and SH3 domains (24Xing L., Ge, C. Zeltser R. Maskevitch G. Mayer B.J. Alexandropoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7363-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 27Burnham M.R.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2345-2354PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive evidence identifies receptor-PTPα (RPTPα) as one such physiological Tyr(P)-527 phosphatase. This PTP, which is particularly abundant in neural tissue, associates physically with SRC and Fyn (26Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D.

In the present study, we have exploited the role of RPTPα as a physiological SRC activator to identify signaling events downstream of SRC in neuronal cells. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum. Retrovirus production and infection were as described (36Su J. Yang L.-T. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28026-28096Google Scholar). For neuritogenesis, 5 × 104 cells were seeded per 35-mm plate, grown overnight, and starved (0.5% fetal calf serum plus 0.5% horse serum) for 16–20 h. To this medium was then added 50 ng/ml acidic FGF plus 5 μg/ml heparin or 100 ng/ml EGF. After 2 days of stimulation, neurite length was measured on photographed fields containing 100–250 cells. Data were expressed in two ways; first, as total neurite length averaged over cell number (bar diagrams; y axis = cell diameters); second, as percent neurite-bearing cells (percent cells bearing at least one neurite larger than two cell diameters). The level of statistical significance was assessed by a two-sided t test (unequal variance). In bar diagrams, error bars always indicate 95% confidence intervals. For numerical data (% neurite-bearing cells), the extent of a 95% confidence interval is indicated by the number between brackets. All key conclusions were re-confirmed on independent clones and/or pools of clones selected en masse. Anti-RPTPα (36Su J. Yang L.-T. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28026-28096Google Scholar), and anti-Sin (38Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) sera have been described. Anti-SRC was from Calbiochem. For the immunoprecipitation/in vitro ERK assay and immunoblotting, anti-ERK-1 C-16 and anti-ERK2 C-14 (Santa Cruz) were used, respectively; anti-phospho-ERK antibody was from New England Biolabs. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 72 was described (36Su J. Yang L.-T. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28026-28096Google Scholar); 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-Cas was a gift of T. Parsons and A. Bouton (University of Virginia). Anti-CrkL C-20 was from Santa Cruz. Anti-Nck sera were provided by E. Skolnik (New York University) or from Santa Cruz (C-19). RPTPα constructs were described (36Su J. Yang L.-T. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28026-28096Google Scholar). The Sin deletion SinSD, lacking residues 101–256 (38Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), was generated using the Exsite kit (Stratagene). Two retroviral vectors were used: pLXSHD (36Su J. Yang L.-T. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28026-28096Google Scholar), and pBabeI-EG (D. Unutmaz, NYU). The latter encodes an long terminal repeat-driven di-cistronic transcript consisting of the transduced cDNA and green fluorescent protein (3′ to an internal ribosomal entry site). cDNA inserts were ligated between XhoI and BamHI of pLXSHD or into the BamHI site of pBabeI-EG. Lysates in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin were cleared at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with antibodies conjugated to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to immunoblotting followed by ECL or125I-autoradiography. Cells on collagen-coated coverslips were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, 20 min) and permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline, 20 min). They were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline plus 10% fetal calf serum for 30 min and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h followed by 10 μg/ml secondary antibody and examined under a Zeiss photomicroscope. For SRC assays, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA) plus protease and PTP inhibitors. Anti-SRC precipitates were washed 3× in radioimmune precipitation buffer and twice in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and split for anti-SRC immunoblotting and kinase assay. Enolase substrate was denatured in 50 mm sodium acetate at 30 °C for 5 min and neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Reactions (50 μl) in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2) contained 12.5 μg of enolase plus 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. ERK1 assays involved precipitation from Triton lysate and incubation in 25 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 10 mmMgCl2) with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP plus 12.5 μg of myelin basic protein for 25 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and gel autoradiographs were quantitated using phosphorimaging. v-SRC induces growth factor-independent neuritogenesis in PC12 cells (4Alema S. Casalbore P. Agostini E. Tato F. Nature. 1985; 316: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but how this may relate to the physiological function of c-SRC is poorly understood. We used retroviral infection to generate a pool of PC12 cells overexpressing c-SRC (Fig. 1 A). This conferred upon EGF (normally a solely mitogenic factor (1Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4209) Google Scholar)) an ability to induce neurite formation equal to that of a bona fide neuritogenic factor (FGF) in control cells (Fig. 1 C). This suggests that an SRC-dependent function can contribute to converting a non-neuritogenic factor (EGF) into a neuritogenic one. Increases in tyrosine phosphorylation after c-SRC overexpression were largely limited to four proteins of 130, 90, 70, and 60 kDa (the latter being SRC itself) (Fig. 1 B). To ask whether endogenous levels of c-SRC could similarly contribute to conversion of EGF into a neuritogenic factor, we relied on the known c-SRC-activating function of RPTPα (26Zheng X.M.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28026-28096Google Scholar). The mutants used were RPTPαCCSS, catalytically inactive due to mutation of the active site cysteine residues in either PTP domain (Cys-442, Cys-732) to serine, and RPTPαY798F, in which Tyr-798, the site of tyrosine phosphorylation in RPTPα, was mutated to phenylalanine (resulting in loss of Grb2 recruitment but normal in vitro catalytic activity (35den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)). Immunofluorescence revealed RPTPα was membrane-localized and concentrated in cell-cell contact zones and at the tips of spontaneous spikes (Fig. 2 A); no significant differences were seen in localization of wt versus mutant proteins (not shown). wt RPTPα and RPTPαY798F, but not RPTPαCCSS, moderately increased c-SRC activity (by 2-fold), with the level of c-SRC protein remaining unchanged (Fig. 2 B). This increase in specific activity likely reflects the well documented ability of RPTPα to reduce the phosphorylation level of the Tyr-527 residue in c-SRC (33Ponniah S. Wang D.Z. Lim K.L.

Contrasting with the situation for c-SRC-overexpressing cells, we observed no constitutive effects of RPTPα on cell morphology or on neurite extension in the absence of added growth factors (data not shown and Fig. 3 B). As reported previously (36Su J. Yang L.-T. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28026-28096Google Scholar), the presence of wt RPTPα, but not catalytically inactive RPTPαCCSS, impairs the ability of FGF (and NGF; data not shown) to cause neurite outgrowth. Mutation of the Tyr-798 phosphorylation site in RPTPα not only abolishes, but inverts this effect of wt RPTPα, since RPTPαY798F behaves instead as a net potentiator of FGF-induced outgrowth (36Su J. Yang L.-T. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28026-28096Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A, right panel). We here report that, unexpectedly, the effect of wt RPTPα on responsiveness to EGF was the opposite of that on FGF responsiveness; that is, wt RPTPα converted EGF into a promoter of neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3 A, left panel). Furthermore, RPTPαY798F promoted neurite outgrowth in response to EGF even more powerfully than wt RPTPα (Fig. 3 A, left panel). In contrast, RPTPαCCSS did not potentiate EGF responsiveness; this catalytically inactive protein even somewhat reduced the formation of short spikes that occurs in response to EGF. It is conceivable that this weak inhibitory effect of RPTPαCCSS reflects dominant negative-like interference with the function of endogenous RPTPα or of a related RPTP. However, to what extent C-to-S mutant PTPs can indeed be relied on to be specific and true dominant-negatives is as yet still unclear; hence, interpretation of the significance of this observation is probably premature. Assessment of mRNA levels by Northern blotting for the metalloprotease transin, a late marker for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (39Machida C.M. Scott J.D. Ciment G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40Munoz A. Wrighton C. Seliger B. Bernal J. Beug H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 423-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), revealed that the EGF-induced neurite extension correlated fully with expression of this marker. EGF treatment lead to transin induction in cells expressing wt RPTPα or RPTPαY798F but not RPTPαCCSS; moreover, this effect was stronger in RPTPαY798F than in wt RPTPα-expressing cells (supplemental data included in the on-line version of manuscript). This indicates that EGF induced not merely morphological effects but also changes in gene expression. The ability of RPTPα to confer outgrowth-promoting activity on the previously non-neuritogenic EGF is reminiscent of c-SRC overexpression, although less drastic, since the effect of RPTPα remained fully EGF-dependent (Fig. 1 C versus Fig. 3,A and B, and data not shown). Pharmacological SRC inhibition using PP1 abolished the neuritogenic effect of RPTPα and RPTPYα798F on stimulation with EGF, whereas cell morphology and viability remained unaffected (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the stimulatory effect of RPTPα on EGF-induced neuritogenesis depends on the activity of a SFK. At the same time, EGF-induced neurite outgrowth still continued to be dependent on ERK activity, as shown by application of PD98059 (a selective MEK1 inhibitor) (Fig. 3 B). We did observe a tendency of EGF-stimulated RPTPαY798F-expressing cells to still form “stumps” in the presence of 10 μm PD98059. However, <2% of cells formed protrusions longer than 2 cell diameters, and any protrusions formed were <1 cell diameter. The number of these protrusions could be reduced significantly by raising the concentration of PD98059 to 25 μm (data not shown). Hence, these protrusions cannot be referred to as neurites, and their true biological significance is questionable at best. A widely cited model traces back the divergent effects of EGF versus FGF on normal PC12 cells to differences in their kinetics of ERK activation. It has been proposed that the relatively transient ERK activation induced by EGF is insufficient for neuritogenesis, which would require the more sustained (>2 h) activation of ERK that is observed for NGF or FGF. This hypothesis was prompted by observations that experimental induction of neurite formation by overexpression of many signaling molecules is invariably accompanied by a shift in ERK activation kinetics from a transient to a sustained mode (1Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4209) Google Scholar). Hence, we wished to determine whether the ability of wt RPTPα and RPTPαY798F to convert EGF into a neuritogenic factor could similarly be accounted for by an alteration, from transient to sustained, in the kinetics of EGF-induced ERK activation. We observed that wt RPTPα inhibited ERK activation in response to FGF at both the 5-min and 6-h time points, with wt RPTPα more potent at reducing ERK activation than RPTPαCCSS and RPTPαY798F (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that optimal inhibition required both catalytic activity and Grb2 binding. Although reduced ERK activation might explain the ability of wt RPTPα to inhibit FGF-induced neurite formation (Fig. 3 A), this correlation broke down for RPTPαY798F, which reduced ERK activation by FGF (Fig. 4 A and data not shown) but enhanced neurite extension induced by this factor (Fig. 3 A). The situation in the case of EGF was analyzed in extensive detail. As expected from the literature (1Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4209) Google Scholar), in control cells, EGF- and FGF-induced ERK activities were comparable at the 5-min time point but differed significantly at later time points, with FGF-induced activation sustained longer (Fig. 4, A–C). Strikingly, however, neither wt RPTPα nor RPTPαY798F (which both potentiate EGF-induced neurite outgrowth; see Fig. 3) potentiated the extent of ERK induction by EGF. In the short term (5 min), expression of wt or mutant RPTPα actually tended to reduce ERK activation (Fig. 4 B, left panel). More importantly, none of the wt or mutant RPTPα proteins significantly altered EGF-induced ERK activation at the late time point (6 h) (Fig. 4 B,right panel). As expected from the literature (1Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4209) Google Scholar), in the control (vector) cells at late time points, EGF-induced ERK activation was significantly lower than FGF-induced activation (Fig. 4 B, right panel, and C). Similar conclusions regarding the effect of RPTPα on ERK activation were reached by in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4 B) and by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies for the activated state of ERK 1 and 2 (Fig. 4 C). We conclude that wt RPTPα and RPTPαY798F counteract the induction of ERK by FGF but do not alter the extent or kinetics of ERK activation in response to EGF. This breakdown of the correlation between neurite outgrowth and the extent of sustained ERK induction leaves the ability of wt RPTPα and RPTPαY798F to induce a neuritogenic response to EGF unexplained. In a search for alternative explanations for conversion of EGF into an outgrowth-promoting factor, we assessed how RPTPα affected cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. We found that wt RPTPα and RPTPαY798F (but not RPTPαCCSS) specifically elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 90-kDa protein and also caused a more modest increase in a 130-kDa species (Fig. 5 A). This pattern is similar to that observed after an increase in c-SRC expression (Fig. 1 B). EGF or FGF did not affect the phosphotyrosine content of these 90- and 130-kDa proteins, and wt or mutant RPTPα did not alter the overall patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation induced in response to EGF or FGF (not shown). In trying to characterize these proteins, we found (data not shown) that RPTPα had not affected phosphorylation of cortactin and Cbl (both SRC substrates) or of FRS-2 (implicated in FGF-dependent PC12 differentiation). However, we successfully identified the proteins whose tyrosine phosphorylation level was elevated by RPTPα as Sin (90 kDa) and Cas (130 kDa"

In general, the reactions render the electrophiles less reactive and the conjugates can be further metabolized and eventually excreted. In addition to their role as detoxication enzymes, the GSTs have been suggested to be involved in different facets of biological signaling. For example, GSTs have been implicated in the synthesis of various prostaglandins (1.Burgess J.R. Chow N.-W. I. Reddy C.C. Tu C.-P. D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and in interactions with protein kinases of signal transduction systems (5.Adler V. Yin Z.M. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). GST A3-3 is the most recent example of GSTs with a connection to biological signaling (6.Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33061-33065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). GST A3-3 efficiently catalyzes double-bond isomerizations of Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione (Δ5-AD) and of Δ5-pregnene-3,20-dione, intermediates in the biosynthesis of the steroid hormones progesterone and testosterone (6.Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33061-33065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this enzyme is expressed selectively in gonads, placenta, and the adrenal gland. These findings indicate that GST A3-3 plays a role in the production of steroid hormones. glutathione transferase glutathione androstene-3,17-dione 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene hydrophobic-substrate binding site 2-chloro-3,5-dinitro-1,1,1-(trifluoromethyl)benzene phenethylisothiocyanate The double-bond isomerization of Δ5-AD appears to represent an entirely different biological function than the cellular disposition of toxic agents normally associated with GSTs (7.Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). However, there are other isomerization reactions catalyzed by GSTs. Thecis-trans conversion of retinoic acid is a GSH-independent reaction catalyzed by GST P1-1 (8.Chen H. Juchau M.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Zeta class GSTs are involved in the catabolic pathway of tyrosine and phenylalanine by catalyzing the GSH-dependent cis-trans isomerization of maleylacetoacetate to fumarylacetoacetate (9.Blackburn A.C. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Board P.G. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 83: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10.Fernández-Cañón J. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 329-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Rat GST A1-1 and GSTs in human liver cytosol have been shown to catalyze the tautomerization of 2-hydroxymenthofuran, a reaction that strictly requires GSH and the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr-9 (11.Khojasteh-Bakht S.C. Nelson S.D. Atkins W.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the latter case a general base-catalyzed isomerization was proposed, in which the thiolate form of GSH serves to deprotonate the substrate and initiate the reaction. This mechanism is similar to the double-bond shift in 3-oxo steroids catalyzed by GST A1-1 (12.Pettersson P.L. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11698-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and GST A3-3 (6.Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33061-33065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, in the isomerizations catalyzed by Zeta class GSTs, GSH is reversibly added as a nucleophile to the substrate rather than functioning as a base, thus representing a mechanism more closely related to GSH conjugations. The members of the Alpha class of GSTs, A1-1, A2-2, and A3-3 are close relatives. From an evolutionary perspective GST A3-3 appears to have diverged from GST A2-2 and GST A1-1, which are the nearest neighbors on the phylogenetic tree (13.Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The latter enzymes have been found to function as efficient glutathione-dependent peroxidases (4.Zhao T.J. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J.Z. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). From the evolutionary branch point GST A3-3 has accumulated mutations in the active site that make it an efficient steroid double-bond isomerase. Despite the high sequence identity (88%) between GST A3-3 and GST A2-2, they differ considerably in their isomerase activities with the steroid Δ5-AD, GST A3-3 displaying a 5000-fold higher catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m). Five of the 26 residues (out of 222, including the initiator methionine) that differ between GST A2-2 and GST A3-3 are located in the hydrophobic substrate-binding site (H-site). In this study, we have investigated the determinants for the high steroid isomerase activity of GST A3-3, and we propose the outline of a reaction mechanism for the isomerization reaction. 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), reduced glutathione (GSH), and 2-chloro-3,5-dinitro-1,1,1-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (o-CF3-CDNB) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Δ4-Androstene-3,17-dione and phenethylisothiocyanate were purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Δ5-Androstene-3,17-dione was obtained from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Interactiva (Ulm, Germany). Restriction enzymes were from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany), and Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The DNA vectors pGEM-3Z and pET-21a(+) were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and Novagen (Madison, WI), respectively. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue was purchased from Stratagene and E. coli BL-21(DE3) from Novagen. The cDNA of GSTA3 was amplified from the original expression clone pKK-DA3 (6.Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33061-33065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) using PCR with the oligonucleotides A3EcoRINdeIG9T: 5′-ATATGAATTC ATATGGCAGGTAAGCCCAAGCTTCAC-3′ (the EcoRI and NdeI restriction sites are underlined and shown in boldface, respectively), A3NCRev 5′-AATAATGTCGACTTGTTAGCCTGGATGGCTGCT-3′ (theSalI site is underlined). The primer A3EcoRINdeIG9T introduces a silent G to T mutation at nucleotide position 9 in the cDNA of GSTA3 to replace a codon seldom used in highly expressed genes in E. coli with a more commonly used codon. The PCR product was subcloned into the pGEM vector using EcoRI andSalI. The GSTA3 cDNA was sequenced using the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) to verify that no mutations had been introduced. The GSTA3 cDNA was subsequently subcloned into the expression vector pET-21a(+) giving the expression clone pET-21a(+)GSTA3. Approximately 65 mg of pure GST A3-3 was successfully obtained per liter of culture medium, a 40-fold increase compared with the yield obtained from the expression system previously used (6.Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33061-33065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The GST A3-3 mutants, GST A3-3/F10S, GST A3-3/L111F, GST A3-3/A216S, GST A3-3/F10S/A216S, GST A3-3/F10S/L111F/A216S, and GST A3-3/Y9F, were constructed using inverted PCR (14.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. 3rd Ed. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 8.81-8.85Google Scholar) with mutagenic oligonucleotides, clonedPfu DNA polymerase, and the appropriate cDNA in the pGEM-3Z vector as template. The PCR conditions used were 95 °C at 10 min followed by the cycle, 95 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min and 30 s, and 72 °C for 10 min, repeated 35 times followed by 20 min at 72 °C. The mutant cDNAs were sequenced and subcloned into the expression vector pET-21a(+) using the restriction sitesNdeI and SalI. The proteins were expressed from the pET-21a(+) vector in E. coli BL-21(DE3). The cells were grown to A 600 = 0.7, and expression was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were grown for 4 h, collected by centrifugation, and lysed using sonication. The lysate was desalted on a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and the proteins were eluted in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and were subsequently loaded onto a HiTrap SP cation exchanger (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The proteins were eluted using a salt gradient. This single purification step yielded highly pure enzymes as confirmed by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. All the mutants were obtained in yields similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The extinction coefficient 23,900 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm for the GSTA3 subunit (6.Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33061-33065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was used to determine the subunit concentration. The specific activities of GST A3-3 and all the constructed GST A3-3 mutants were determined for the isomerization reaction with Δ5-AD (see Fig. 1 A) and for the conjugation reaction with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and GSH (Fig. 1 B). The reactions were monitored spectrophotometrically at 30 °C. The isomerization of 100 μm Δ5-AD was followed at 248 nm in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, in the presence of 1 mm GSH. The extinction coefficient for the product Δ4-AD is 16,300 m−1cm−1 (15.Benson A.M. Talalay P. Keen J.H. Jakoby W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Specific activity measurements with 1 mm CDNB were performed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, in the presence of 1 mm GSH as described previously (16.Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All steady-state kinetic measurements were performed at 30 °C. The isomerization activity of GST A3-3 and the GST A3-3 mutants was monitored at pH 8.0, in 25 mm sodium phosphate at a close-to-saturating concentration of GSH (2 mm). The concentration of Δ5-AD was varied between 1 and 200 μm. In addition, saturation curves with Δ5-AD were measured in the absence of GSH for GST A3-3 and GST A3-3/Y9F. The conjugating activities of GST A3-3, GST A3-3/L111F, GST A3-3/F10S/L111F/A216S, and GST A3-3/Y9F with CDNB were measured in 0.1 m sodium phosphate pH 6.5 at 5 mm GSH and with phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) (Fig. 1 C) in 0.1 msodium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 5 mm GSH as described (17.Meyer D.J. Crease D.J. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The concentrations of CDNB ranged between 25 and 1500 μm, and the concentration of phenethylisothiocyanate was varied between 5 and 400 μm. Kinetic parameters were determined from the data using non-linear regression analysis. Catalytic center activities (k cat) were expressed per subunit (25,300 Da). The ionization of Tyr-9 was measured as a function of pH by UV absorption difference spectroscopy (18.Björnestedt R. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Board P.G. Sinning I. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The intrinsic absorbance at 253 nm of 10–15 μmsubunits of the different enzyme variants was measured in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer at pH 5.5–8.0 and 0.1m ethanolamine/HCl at pH 8.2–9.0 at 22 °C. The spectrum of the same protein sample at pH 5.5 was subtracted from the spectra obtained at other pH values. The equation ΔA = ΔAmax/[1 + 10( p Ka− pH)] was fitted to the data using rffit provided in the SIMFIT package (19.Bardsley W.G. Bukhari N.A.J. Ferguson M.W.J. Cachaza J.A. Burguillo F.J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 19: 75-84Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The effect of adding a saturating concentration of Δ4-AD (100 μm) or GSH (2 mm) on the pK a of Tyr-9 of wild-type GST A3-3 was monitored by measuring the intrinsic absorbance at 300 nm, because both molecules absorb strongly at 253 nm. To calculate the number of tyrosinates per subunit, the ΔA 253 and ΔA 300 values were divided by the subunit concentration used and the extinction coefficient determined for GST tyrosines at 253 and 300 nm, 11,000 and 2350m−1 cm−1, respectively (20.Atkins W.M. Dietze E.C. Ibarra C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,21.Dietze E.C. Ibarra C. Dabrowski M.J. Bird A. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11938-11944Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The pK a of GSH bound to the active site of GST A3-3 and GST A3-3/F10S/L111F/A216S was determined from spectra of 10 μm subunits in the presence of 0.5 mm GSH in the sample cuvette. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectrum for the enzyme alone at pH 5.5 and the spectra of GSH at the corresponding pH values from the spectrum of the enzyme·GSH complex. The peak at 239 nm arising from the thiolate was plotted against pH and the equation ΔA = ΔAmax/[1 + 10( p Ka− pH)] was fitted to the data points using rffit (19.Bardsley W.G. Bukhari N.A.J. Ferguson M.W.J. Cachaza J.A. Burguillo F.J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 19: 75-84Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To calculate the number of ionized GSH molecules per protein subunit the extinction coefficient 5200m−1 cm−1 at 239 nm determined for the thiolate anion in the GST active site was used (22.Graminski G.F. Kubo Y. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3562-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The isomerase activity of GST A3-3, GST A3-3/Y9F, and GST A3-3/F10S/L111F/A216S with Δ5-AD in the presence of 2 mm GSH was measured at pH intervals of ∼0.4 pH units in the pH range 5.7–8.8. Below pH 8.0 the measurements were performed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, and 0.1 methanolamine/HCl was used above pH 8.0. The concentration of Δ5-AD was varied between 1 and 200 μm. The affinity between the steroids Δ5-AD or Δ4-AD and wild-type GST A3-3, GST A3-3/L111F, and GST A3-3/F10S/L111F/A216S was studied by inhibition experiments. When Δ4-AD was used as an inhibitor, the concentration of the substrate Δ5-AD was varied between 2.5 and 400 μm in 25 mm sodium phosphate at pH 8.0. The activity was measured in the absence and presence of 400 μm Δ4-AD. The inhibitory potency of Δ5-AD was determined by means of competition experiments with the alternative substrate o-CF3-CDNB using 100 μm Δ5-AD in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, at a fixed GSH concentration of 2 mm. The concentration of o-CF3-CDNB was varied between 25 and 700 μm. The initial velocities were determined spectrophotometrically at 30 °C, and the equation describing competitive inhibition was fitted to the data by non-linear regression analysis. Sequence alignment of the Alpha class GSTs and structural information available for the close relative GST A1-1 (23.Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L.

Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) were used to identify residues in GST A3-3 that are potential determinants for the high steroid isomerase activity. GST A2-2, which displays a lower steroid double-bond isomerase activity by three orders of magnitude as compared with GST A3-3 (6.Johansson A.-S. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33061-33065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 12.Pettersson P.L. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11698-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), differs from GST A3-3 in 26 amino acids out of 222 (including the initiator methionine). Five of these residues are situated in the H-site as judged from the crystal structure (23.Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The mutations in GST A3-3 required to mimic the H-site of GST A2-2 are F10S, I12G, L111F, A208M, and A216S. The mutations F10S and A216S change the topography of the active site and introduce polar residues with hydrogen bonding potential. Because Δ5-AD is a highly hydrophobic substrate, one would expect the introduction of polar residues to lower the binding affinity by providing a less hydrophobic environment in the active site. The active site of the highly efficient Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase in bacteria is very hydrophobic (24.Wu Z.R. Ebrahimian S. Zawrotny M.E. Thornburg L.D. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Brothers P. Pollack R.M. Summers M.F. Science. 1997; 276: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25.Kim S.W. Cha S.S. Cho H.S. Kim J.S. Ha N.C. Cho M.J. Joo S. Kim K.K. Choi K.Y. Oh B.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14030-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) suggesting that introduction of polar residues in the active site of GST A3-3 would impair the isomerase activity. Hydrogen bonding between the serine residues, and the keto groups of the steroid may also lead to non-productive binding of the substrate. A crystal structure of GST A3-3 is not yet solved nor is any other relevant structure available for a GST in complex with a steroid such as Δ4-AD. However, in all structures of GST A1-1 crystallized with a hydrophobic S-substituent on GSH in the active site, residue 111 is identified as a residue that lines the H-site with its side chain oriented toward the hydrophobic moiety (23.Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar,26.Cameron A.D. Sinning I. L'Hermite G. Olin B. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). An increase of the volume of residue 111 might affect productive binding of a large substrate through steric hindrance. To study the role of residues 10, 111, and 216 in the enzymatic function of GST A3-3, the separate and combined mutations F10S, L111F, and A216S were constructed, introducing the amino acids of GST A2-2 in the positions of the variant residues. In other GSTs Tyr-9 has been shown to be a catalytically important residue (27.Stenberg G. Board P.G. Mannervik B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28.Kolm R.H. Sroga G.E. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Y9F mutant was constructed to investigate the function of the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr-9 also in GST A3-3. The ionization of tyrosine residues in GST A3-3, GST A3-3/L111F, GSTA3-3/F10S/L111F/A216S, and GST A3-3/Y9F was monitored as a function of pH by measuring the intrinsic absorbance of the enzyme at 253 nm. The titration curves are shown in Fig. 2. Ionization of tyrosines other than Tyr-9 in the enzyme makes only minor contributions in the pH range used as shown by titration of GST A3-3/Y9F (Fig. 2). The L111F mutation in GST A3-3 increases the pK a value of Tyr-9 from 7.93 ± 0.04 to 8.25 ± 0.08. Addition of the point mutations F10S and A216S affords an additional shift of 1 pH unit to a pK a value of 9.2, ∼1.3 pH units higher than that of GST A3-3 and approaching the pK a value of tyrosine in aqueous solution, 10.1 (29.Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1993: 16Google Scholar). The effect of adding a saturating concentration of Δ4-AD (100 μm) or GSH (2 mm) on the pK a of Tyr-9 of wild-type GST A3-3 was monitored by measuring the tyrosinate absorbance at 300 nm. This higher wavelength was chosen, because both ligands absorb strongly at 253 nm. Δ4-AD did not affect the pK a value of Tyr-9 (data not shown), but the presence of 2 mm GSH increased the pK avalue of Tyr-9 by ∼1 pH unit to 8.8 ± 0.2, showing that the ionization of Tyr-9 is linked to the ionization of GSH. The pK a value of GSH bound to the active site of GST A3-3 was determined as 6.1 ± 0.1. This pK avalue was shifted to 7.1 ± 0.2 in the GST A3-3/S10F/L111F/A216S mutant. In the GST A3-3/Y9F mutant the pK a value was increased to 6.5 ± 0.2, demonstrating that the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr-9 has only a minor influence on the ionization of the thiol group of GSH, which in aqueous solution has a pK a value of 9.2 (30.Jung G. Breitmaier E. Voelter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 24: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The role of Tyr-9, or equivalent residues, in GSTs is generally considered to be stabilization of the thiolate of GSH in the active site by serving as hydrogen bond donor (7.Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). In GST A1-1 the corresponding mutation afforded a similar minor increase in the pK a value of GSH from 6.7 to 7.2 (12.Pettersson P.L. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11698-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This change of 0.5 pH unit corresponds to a 2.8 kJ/mol stabilization of the thiol over the thiolate form. It is notable that this is less than the energy of a fully formed hydrogen bond (31.Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1999Google Scholar). The pK a value of GSH bound to the active site of GST A3-3/Y9F is 2.7 pH units lower than in solution (30.Jung G. Breitmaier E. Voelter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 24: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) showing that other groups together contribute more than the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr-9 to lowering the pK a of GSH. A plausible candidate is Arg-15, which in GST A1-1 lowers the pK a of GSH (18.Björnestedt R. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Board P.G. Sinning I. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The pK a of GSH was increased by 1.0 pH unit to 7.1 ± 0.2 in the GSTA3-3/F10S/L111F/A216S mutant. This may be due to an influence of the hydrophilic serines on the first-sphere interactions from Tyr-9 and Arg-15 that contribute to the lowering of the pK a of GSH, in such a way that their thiolate-stabilizing effect is impaired. The specific activities of wild-type GST A3-3 and the constructed GST A3-3 mutants with the substrates Δ5-AD and CDNB are compiled in Table I. For comparison, specific activity values are also given for the homologous GST A1-1, the GST A1-1/Y9F mutant, and GST A2-2. The single mutation that produces the most pronounced difference in specific activity with Δ5-AD is the Y9F mutation, which lowers the specific activity 350-fold. However, this same mutation decreases the specific activity only ∼2-fold with CDNB. In GST A1-1 the corresponding Y9F mutation decreases the specific activity with Δ5-AD and CDNB 43- and 300-fold, respectively (12.Pettersson P.L. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11698-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl group of Tyr-9 in GST A3-3 therefore seems to play a more important role in the catalysis of the double-bond isomerization than in the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of GSH and CDNB. In the case of GST A1-1 Tyr-9 is relatively less important for the isomerase reaction. Also the L111F mutation in GST A3-3 by itself markedly decreases the specific activity with Δ5-AD (27-fold) but affords a notable 4-fold increase in the specific activity with CDNB.Table ISpecific activities of Alpha class GSTs and active-site mutants determined with Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzeneEnzymeSpecific activity1-aValues are means ± S.E. of at least five measurements.Δ5-ADCDNB(μmolmg−1min−1)GST A3-3285 ± 523 ± 3GST A3-3/A216S290 ± 1022.7 ± 0.3GST A3-3/F10S133 ± 2411.2 ± 0.4GST A3-3/F10S/A216S123 ± 115.7 ± 0.1GST A3-3/L111F10.6 ± 0.285.9 ± 1.5GST A3-3/F10S/L111F/A216S5.1 ± 0.211.8 ± 0.5GST A3-3/Y9F0.8 ± 0.19.2 ± 0.5GST A1-140 ± 31-bValues are from Ref.12.111 ± 81-bValues are from Ref.12.GST A1-1/Y9F0.94 ± 0.121-bValues are from Ref.12.0.37 ± 0.061-bValues are from Ref.12.GST A2-20.172 ± 0.0031-bValues are from Ref.12.58 ± 41-bValues are from Ref.12.1-a Values are means ± S.E. of at least five measurements.1-b Values are from Ref.12.

The antivenin property of a water extract of seeds was assessed in vivoin mice. The serum of mice treated with extract was tested for its immunological properties. Two proteins of Echis carinatusvenom with apparent molecular masses of 25 and 16 kDa were detected by Western blot analysis carried out using IgG of mice immunized with extract or its partially purified protein fractions. By enzymatic in-gel digestion and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis of immunoreactive venom proteins, phospholipase A2, the most toxic enzyme of snake venom, was identified. These results demonstrate that the observed antivenin activity has an immune mechanism. Antibodies of mice treated with non-lethal doses of venom reacted against some proteins ofM. pruriens extract.

Snakebite is a considerable problem in certain tropical and subtropical countries. According to World Health Organization estimates, 40,000 of 5 million cases of snakebite are fatal. Antivenins obtained from horses treated with snake venom are one of the principal remedies against snakebite. This therapy has the disadvantage that antivenins must be given immediately, and snakebite victims may develop an adverse reaction including anaphylactic shock (1.Chippaux J.P. Goyffon M. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 823-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The use of endogenous plants with a reputation against snakebite is therefore worth considering (2.Martz W.

M. pruriens (family: Fabaceae; subfamily: Papilionoideae; genus:Mucuna; species: pruriens) seeds were collected in the Rukuba area in Jos, Nigeria with the aid of a traditional healer. They were authenticated by Prof. S. W. H. Hussini of the Department of Botany, University of Jos. Voucher specimen number A102 is deposited in the Pharmacy Herbarium of the University of Jos. CDI-ICR mice (30 g) from Nossan were kept at a temperature of 22 ± 1 °C with a relative humidity of 60 ± 5% in a 12-h light/dark cycle with a standard diet and water ad libitum. Sundried seeds of M. pruriens were ground to a paste of uniform consistency, 50 g of which was soaked in 100 ml of H2O, extracted for 24 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant lyophilized to a powder (24% protein), which was stored at −4 °C. Separation of the protein (P) and non-protein (NP) fractions was achieved by gel filtration on a HiPrep 26/10 column: 5 ml of MPE solution (5.4 mg/ml) was loaded and eluted with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7 (flow rate of 5 ml/min). E 280 nm,E 254 nm, and conductivity were monitored. For partial purification of MPE proteins, 5 ml of MPE solution (5.4 mg/ml) was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (2.6 × 80 cm) eluted with 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and read at 280 nm. P1, P2, and P3 were obtained. Groups of eight mice were injected with MPE, P, or NP fractions or saline (control). At different times afterward, the mice were injected with a minimum lethal dose of EV (minimal lethal dose, 2 mg/kg). The percentage of survivors was assessed 24 h later. The control group was injected with saline before EV. All fractions were injected intraperitoneally at doses proportional to body weight, calculating dilution after separation. Six groups of eight mice were treated once a week for 3 weeks with MPE, P1, P2, P3, EV (non-lethal dose), and saline. After 28 days they were sacrificed, blood was withdrawn, and anti-MPE, anti-P1, anti-P2, anti-P3, anti-EV, and preimmune sera were obtained. All antisera were purified by affinity chromatography with an AKTA liquid chromatography system. 10 ml of each anti-serum diluted in binding buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7) and filtered on a 0.22-μm membrane was adsorbed on a 5-ml protein G column (1.6 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated in binding buffer until all unbound material was washed out. IgG fractions were then eluted at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.7 (elution buffer). The fractions were neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 9, and concentrated with Centriplus membrane (final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml). Proteins in all fresh samples were determined by a Bio-Rad assay (22.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). They were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm) at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C and stained with Ponceau S. The membrane was blocked with 0.3% non-fat powdered milk in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at 37 °C with treated mouse IgG. IgG of untreated mice was used as the negative control. The membrane was washed in 1× PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000), and developed by ECL. Detection of total proteins after 12% SDS-PAGE was achieved by silver staining using PlusOne™ silver staining kit protein. The minimal lethal dose of EV was preincubated with 100 μl each of anti-MPE, anti-EV, anti-P1, anti-P2, anti-P3, and preimmune IgG fractions at 37 °C for 1 h. The preincubated mixtures were then injected into six groups of eight mice. Control groups were injected with EV mixed with saline or purified IgG from serum of preimmune mice. The number of deaths in the subsequent 24 h was recorded. Antigenic relationships between the various antigens were studied by double diffusion test, according to Ouchterlony and Nilsson (24.Ouchterlony Ö. Nilsson L.A. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Publishers, Oxford1986: 321-325Google Scholar). Holes 5 mm in diameter were punched in horizontal gels containing 1% agarose in 1× PBS. Protein fractions of MPE or EV (20 μl) were placed in the peripheral wells and IgG in the central well. Diffusion was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 37 °C. The gel was then washed with saline and dried. The precipitin line was visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Coomassie Blue-stained EV and MPE protein bands separated by SDS-PAGE were excised from the gel and digested with trypsin according to known procedures (25.Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, gel slices were washed for at least 1 h in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and then for 1 h with 50% acetonitrile,100 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0, under shaking. Acetonitrile was added to shrink the gel pieces, and after 10–15 min of incubation, the solvent was removed and the samples were dried in a Speed Vac. Gel slices were reswollen with 25 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0, containing modified trypsin (Promega) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%. Peptides were extracted from the gel slices twice with 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min. All supernatants were combined, and after evaporation to near dryness, peptide fragments were reconstituted in 20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The mixture of peptides was separated using a Nucleosil C 8 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size, 300 A) and analyzed with a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) with an ESI source. A detailed scheme of the experimental setup for this type of analyses is described elsewhere (26.Yen T. Joshi R.K. Yan H. Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Macher B.A. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 990-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, a positive voltage of 3 kV was applied to the electrospray needle, and a N2 sheath flow was applied to stabilize the ESI signal. The LC/MS analysis was conducted using a PerkinElmer high pressure liquid chromatography system coupled to the LCQ. The mobile phase from the column (flow rate of 0.5 ml/min) was split before the mass injector by a Tee-connector. The enzymatically digested peptides were eluted from the column using 0.5% formic acid in water (mobile phase A) and 0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B) with a three-step linear gradient of 5–10% B in the first 10 min, 10–35% B in the next 40 min, and 35–40% B in the last 5 min. The LC/ESI-MS/MS analysis was accomplished using an automated data acquisition procedure in which a cyclic series of three different scan modes was performed. Data acquisition was conducted using the full scan mode (m/z 300–2000) to obtain the most intense peak (signal > 1.5 × 105 counts) as the precursor ion, followed by a high resolution zoom scan mode to determine the charge state of the precursor ion and MS/MS scan mode to determine the structural fragment ions of the precursor ion. The resulting MS/MS spectra were then matched against a protein data base (Owl) by Sequest software to confirm the sequence of tryptic peptides. We first found that the protective effect of MPE against the lethal effect of EV was exerted at a dose of 21 μg/g and was evident 24 h and 1–4 weeks after administration. To understand the chemical nature of substances responsible for the protection, an in vivo test was set up with two fractions obtained by HiPrep separation of MPE, one containing P and the other one NP compounds from MPE (Fig. 1). NP fractions contain small molecules like l-DOPA responsible for E 280 nmabsorbance, free amino acids, ions, and fatty acids as already reported (18.Revilleza M.A.J.R. Mendoza E.M.T. Raymundo L.C. Plant Foods Hum. Nutr. 1990; 40: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19.Siddhuraju P. Vijayakumari K. Janardhanan K. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1996; 44: 2636-2641Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The in vivo test showed that P and NP fractions exerted protection in different ways. As shown in Table I, the NP fraction conferred short term protection (1 day), whereas the P fraction conferred long term protection (1, 2, and 3 weeks after administration). When we comparatively injected mice with MPE, P, and NP fractions once a week for 3 weeks, the protective effect of the P fraction specifically increased. Some compounds in the NP fraction may be adjuvants in the long term protective effect because the P fraction was less active when used alone. Only with a booster dose of P fraction was the total effect restored.Table IIn vivo protective effect of M. pruriens against E. carinatus venomFractionsDoseSurvivors/totalDry extractProteins1 day1 week3 weeks3 weeks (A)μg/gMPE214.26/85/87/88/8P214.12/83/85/88/8NP2105/83/82/82/8Control000/80/80/80/8Time course of in vivo effect of MPE, P, and NP fractions against EV is shown. Groups of eight mice were injected with the indicated fractions and treated with a minimum lethal dose of EV (2 mg/Kg) 24 h, 1 week, and 3 weeks later. The control group was injected with saline and then EV. Survivors were counted 24 h after EV injection. All fractions were injected intraperitoneally with doses proportional to body weight (μg/g). All groups received one injection except group A in the last column, which was immunized with one injection a week for 3 weeks. Open table in a new tab Time course of in vivo effect of MPE, P, and NP fractions against EV is shown.

The control group was injected with saline and then EV. Survivors were counted 24 h after EV injection. All fractions were injected intraperitoneally with doses proportional to body weight (μg/g). All groups received one injection except group A in the last column, which was immunized with one injection a week for 3 weeks. Three well resolved protein peaks, P1, P2, P3, and NP fraction were obtained by further purification of MPE by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 HR. They are shown in Fig. 2. The protective activities of MPE, P1, P2, and P3 were tested for their capacities to raise antibodies in mice against EV proteins. IgG were purified from anti-MPE, anti-P1, anti-P2, anti-P3, and preimmune mice serum with protein G affinity separation and used in Western blot experiments. When anti-MPE IgG were tested against EV proteins, two protein bands with apparent molecular masses of about 25 kDa (EV25) and 16 kDa (EV16) were detected. The signal was only visible under reducing conditions implying that the epitope on the native EV protein was in a cryptic state. When MPE proteins were incubated with the specific anti-MPE IgG, as positive control, a pattern similar to that obtained with silver staining was achieved, indicating that almost all MPE proteins were highly antigenic (Fig. 3 A). When the protein fractions obtained by partial purification of MPE on Sephacryl S-200 were injected into mice, we also obtained antibodies against EV. Antibodies raised in mice by injecting P2 fraction gave similar results to those obtained with anti-MPE IgG, whereas when anti-P3 IgG was used, only EV16 was detected. No signal against any EV proteins was obtained using IgG of mice treated with P1 fraction (anti-P1 IgG). Positive controls of anti-P1, -P2, and -P3 IgG were the corresponding P1, P2, and P3 fractions (Fig. 3 B). Under reducing conditions, some anti-EV IgG reacted with at least three bands of MPE proteins with molecular masses in the range of 22–28 kDa (MPE 22–28) as shown in Fig. 3 C. These proteins mainly belong to the P2 fraction. EV proteins reacted strongly against the specific anti-EV IgG under non-reducing conditions, and this sample was used as positive control. The capacity of anti-MPE, anti-P1, anti-P2, and anti-P3 IgG to neutralize the toxicityin vivo of EV was tested after incubation of the fractions with venom, and results are reported in Table II. No neutralization was observed in control groups 1 and 2 (negative controls); lethal potency of EV was neutralized by anti-EV IgG obtained from mice treated with a non-lethal dose of EV (group 3, positive control). Anti-MPE (group 4) and anti-P2 (group 6) showed neutralizing effects similar to that of group 3; less neutralization was obtained with anti-P3 (group 7), and no neutralizing effect was obtained with anti-P1 (group 5). A 50% survival percentage was considered a satisfactory neutralizing effect.Table IINeutralization activity of IgG fractionsGroupMixtureSurvivors/total1EV + saline0/122EV + preimmune IgG0/123EV + anti-EV IgG7/124EV + anti-MPE IgG6/125EV + anti-P1 IgG0/126EV + anti-P2 IgG5/127EV + anti-P3 IgG3/12Minimal lethal dose of EV was incubated at 37°C for 1 h with 100 μl of the IgG fractions indicated (mixture). This was the dose for a 30-g mouse. Five groups of 12 mice were used. Groups 1 and 2 were negative controls, group 3 positive control. Open table in a new tab Minimal lethal dose of EV was incubated at 37°C for 1 h with 100 μl of the IgG fractions indicated (mixture). This was the dose for a 30-g mouse. Five groups of 12 mice were used. Groups 1 and 2 were negative controls, group 3 positive control. To confirm the results of Western blot experiments and to ascertain the presence of one or more common antigenic epitopes in MPE and EV proteins, the double diffusion test was used. When anti-MPE IgG was tested against MPE and EV proteins, a pattern shown in Fig. 4 a was obtained indicating coalescence of antigens. When anti-EV IgG was tested against MPE, P2, P3, and EV one precipitin line was formed in all cases (Fig. 4 b). For the identification of proteins involved in this phenomenon, enzymatic in-gel digestion and ESI-MS/MS analysis of MPE and EV immunoreactive proteins were performed. The most intense peaks in the mass spectrum were automatically selected using Sequest software for the data base search. The proteins were identified by correlation of the experimentally obtained MS/MS spectra to the theoretically predicted peptide MS/MS spectra of proteins present in the data base. Two peptides of the tryptic digested mixture of EV16 protein were found with sequences NLFQFAEMIVK (Fig. 5 A) and DNLNTYDKK (Fig. 5 B) matching that of Russell's viper phospholipase A2. The present results demonstrate that extracts of M. pruriens seeds protect mice against the toxic effects of EV. It does so by an immunological mechanism based on a series of specific epitopes common to some vegetal and venom proteins. The in vivo test results indicate that administration of MPE proteins raised antibodies responsible for the protection observed. The long term protection was in fact more complete when the P fraction was administered according to an immunization protocol (once a week for 3 weeks). Several proteins in the P2 fraction are involved in raising antibodies, while the most purified P3 fraction is less active. We demonstrated by Western blot analysis that certain antibodies induced in mice by injection of vegetal extracts reacted directly with certain EV proteins, and immunodiffusion experiments pointed out the cross-reaction between MPE and EV proteins. Western blot analysis carried out using anti-MPE and anti-P2 IgG showed that only EV proteins with molecular masses around 25 and 16 kDa were targets of the antibodies raised in mice after injection of MPE or P2; the toxic effect in vivo of EV was neutralized when the venom was preincubated with these IgG before injection. EV25 and EV16 may be the most toxic components of EV acting in concert, and their neutralization seems to impair the toxic mixture making it non-lethal. Anti-P3 IgG did not totally neutralize the venom, presumably because it only reacted with a single protein of EV (EV16). Electrospray mass spectrometry combined with a peptide sequence tag search lead to the identification of the proteins with an estimated molecular mass of 16 kDa in the EV16 band as PLA2. The sequences of two peptides obtained by trypsin digestion matched the sequence of Russell's viper PLA2 (Daboia russellii), while the venom we used was certified to be fromE. carinatus sochureki. This may be explained by the fact that only one sequence of E. carinatus PLA2 is deposited in the data base, whereas various isoenzymes are known in literature (13.Polgar J. Magnenat E.M.

Toxicon. 1987; 25: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as shown in our experiments and declared by our supplier. Since the genera Echis and Daboia are very similar and both belong to the subfamily Viperinae, the E. carinatus PLA2 that we analyzed may be a genetic variant, the sequence of which is closest to that of Russell's viper. In our recent paper (29.Guerranti R. Aguiyi J.C. Errico E. Pagani R. Marinello E. J. Ethnopharmacol. 2001; 75: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) we demonstrated the in vitroeffects of anti-MPE on EV enzymes catalyzing prothrombin transformation. PLA2 is known to be implicated in that reaction, and our present results confirmed that PLA2, the enzyme largely responsible for the lethal effects of snake venom, is the putative target of the antibodies induced by MPE. Analysis of in-gel trypsin digestion of the EV25 band gave us no significant conclusions because no sequences of EV proteins with an estimated molecular mass of 25 kDa has been yet reported in the data bases. We also tried to identify the specific MPE protein(s) responsible for the observed phenomenon. Our results suggest the presence of similar epitopes in EV and MPE proteins. This enabled us to use anti-EV IgG to detect specific proteins of MPE, limiting the numbers of animals necessary for in vivo testing during protein purification. We succeeded in identifying a group of MPE immunoreactive proteins (at least three bands) very likely due to isoforms. When tryptic digested mixtures of these bands were analyzed by ESI-MS/MS no significant matchings were obtained considering that the genome and proteome ofM. pruriens is still unexplored and that no protein sequences are reported in the data bases. A molecular biology approach is required to identify these proteins, and it will be a topic for future researches. It seems surprising that proteins of EV and MPE could have common epitopes; however, other examples of sequences shared by plant and snake venom proteins have been reported. The lectin domain, contained in all plant chitin-binding proteins, shows a sequence similarity to disintegrins of crotalid and viperid snake venoms (30.Kieliszewski M.J. Showalter A.M. Leykam J.F. Plant J. 1994; 5: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Another example is the similar overall folding pattern of the three-dimensional structures of snake venom postsynaptic neurotoxins and the domains of wheat germ agglutinin (31.Drenth J. Low B.W. Richardson J.S. Wright C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2652-2655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All venom proteins have different functional activities but they show structural and evolutionary relationships; they are derived from a common precursor and share conserved domains (32.Kini R.M. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33.Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Finn R.D. Sonnhammer E.L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 34.Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), some of which are common to plant proteins. The C-type lectin domain (CTL or carbohydrate-recognition domain, CRD) has a highly conserved structure (35.Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Drickamer K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 207-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), is responsible for carbohydrate binding, and has been found in all calcium-dependent type lectin-related proteins, echicetin, ECLVIX/XBp, and carinactivase. Like many other Leguminosae plants,M. pruriens seeds contain legume lectins (37.Mo H. Goldstein I.J. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) that belong to the same family of C-type animal lectins and may contain the same CTL domain of calcium-dependent type lectin-related proteins of EV. We can conclude that when MPE proteins are injected into mice in such a way as to induce abundant antibody production, a polyclonal serum against epitopes present on one or more EV proteins is obtained. If MPE extract and some of its proteins protect mice against EV PLA2 or other snake venom proteins that show procoagulant and anticoagulant activities, very likely they could interfere in the coagulation process. The present findings open new perspectives in the field of vaccine by natural products and may be useful in the therapy of snakebite and other coagulation disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2069970378,"Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, which functions as an endocytic receptor for diverse ligands. In this study, we demonstrate that murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF-2 cells) and 13-5-1 Chinese hamster ovary cells, which are LRP-deficient, accumulate greatly increased levels of cell-surface fibronectin (Fn), compared with LRP-expressing MEF-1 and CHO-K1 cells. Increased Fn was also detected in conditioned medium from LRP-deficient MEF-2 cells; however, biosynthesis of Fn by MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells was not significantly different. When LRP-deficient cells were dissociated from monolayer culture, increased levels of Fn remained with the cells, as determined by cell-surface protein biotinylation, suggesting an intimate relationship with cell surface-binding sites. The LRP antagonist, receptor-associated protein (RAP), promoted Fn accumulation in association with MEF-1 cells, whereas expression of full-length LRP in MEF-2 cells substantially decreased Fn accumulation, confirming the role of LRP in this process. Purified LRP bound directly to immobilized Fn, and this interaction was inhibited by RAP. Furthermore, MEF-1 cells degraded 125I-Fn at an increased rate, compared with MEF-2 cells. 125I-Fn degradation by MEF-1 cells was inhibited by RAP. These results demonstrate that LRP functions as a catabolic receptor for Fn. The function of LRP in Fn degradation and the ability of LRP to regulate levels of other plasma membrane proteins represent possible mechanisms whereby LRP prevents Fn accumulation on cell surfaces.

Structural variants of Fn arise from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing and post-translational modification (3Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E.

As one of the most ubiquitous and multifunctional ECM proteins, Fn plays a major role in such fundamental biological processes as cell adhesion, migration, growth, differentiation, cytoskeletal organization, hemostasis and thrombosis, and oncogenesis (5Yamada K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 761-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 6Mosher D.F. Annu. Rev. Med. 1984; 35: 561-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 7Hynes R.O.

The structure of Fn includes well defined binding sites for multiple macromolecules, including cell-surface receptors, sulfated glycosaminoglycans, gelatin, and fibrin (8Yamada K.M. Curr. Opin.

Many of the cellular receptors that bind Fn are members of the integrin family, including the major Fn receptor, α5β1, but also α4β1, α3β1, αvβ1, and αvβ3(11Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Fn binding to integrins is particularly important because this interaction results in cell signaling involving multiple factors, including the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins and phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (12Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 13King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell.

Fn-α5β1 interactions are also critical in supporting the formation of extracellular Fn fibrils (15Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which may then function to suppress signaling pathways that lead to apoptosis (16Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E.

In addition to integrins, Fn fibril formation is controlled by macromolecules in the pericellular spaces and involves interaction of multiple Fn domains with other ECM components (19Mosher D.F.

Processes that regulate Fn catabolism are not well understood. One hypothesis is that Fn levels are controlled by local proteolysis (22Berry H. Pauthe E. Gallet O. Larreta-Garde V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 864: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Serine proteinases, and in particular urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasmin, may play an important role (23Gold L.I. Schwimmer R. Quigley J.P. Biochem.

In the liver, forms of Fn with terminal galactose residues may be cleared and catabolized by asialoglycoprotein receptors (28Rotundo R.F. Vincent P.A. McKeown-Longo P.J. Blumenstock F.A. Saba T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1189-G1199PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, certain integrins, including α5β1, are known to undergo endocytosis and recycling (29Bretscher M.S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 30Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 31Laukaitis C.M. Webb D.J.

Thus, it is reasonable to assume that, under some circumstances, Fn may be internalized with α5β1. The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a member of the LDL receptor family, which is constitutively transported through a pathway that includes rapid endocytosis in clathrin-coated pits and efficient recycling (32Chen W.J.

LRP binds many ligands, delivering these proteins to lysosomes, including activated α2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein E, plasminogen activators, proteinase-inhibitor complexes, and thrombospondin (36Herz J.

Other receptors in this family, such as the VLDL receptor and megalin/LRP-2, may be partially redundant with regard to ligand binding specificity; however, members of the LDL receptor family have different patterns of expression, at the cellular level, and generate different phenotypes when the genes are eliminated in knock-out mice (37Trommsdorff M.

In the present study, we demonstrate that Fn accumulates to greatly increased levels in the medium and ECM surrounding fibroblasts and CHO cells that are LRP-deficient. LRP binds directly to immobilized Fn, and this interaction is inhibited by receptor-associated protein (RAP), a 39-kDa protein that functions as a general antagonist of specific LRP interactions (40Strickland D.K.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that LRP mediates Fn catabolism by cells in culture. From these studies, we conclude that LRP may be a major regulator of Fn accumulation on cell surfaces. Fn was purified from human plasma by the method of Ruoslahti et al. (43Ruoslahti E. Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M. Engvall E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 803-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). LRP was purified from human placenta as described previously (44Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). GST-RAP was expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (45Webb D.J.

As a control, GST without fused RAP was also expressed and purified from bacteria transformed with the empty vector, pGEX-2T. Monoclonal antibody 8G1, which recognizes the 515-kDa LRP heavy chain, has been described previously (46Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fn-specific polyclonal antibody (F-3648) and globulin-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Sigma. Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, sheep anti-mouse IgG, Na125I, and [35S]methionine were from Amersham Biosciences. The expression construct, which encodes full-length human LRP in pcDNA3.1, has been described previously (47Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I. Tanzi R.E. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J.

Other chemicals were from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that are genetically deficient in LRP (MEF-2 or PEA-13 cells), LRP(+/−) MEFs (PEA-10 cells), and normal MEFs (MEF-1 cells) from the same mouse strain were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, as described previously (48Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B41 cells are MEF-2 cells that were transfected for stable expression of full-length human LRP and single-cell cloned. Transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Colonies were selected with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B and analyzed for LRP expression and function. Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells and LRP-deficient, 13-5-1 CHO cells (49FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D.K. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were cultured in Ham’s F-12 medium, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum optimized for CHO cells (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were lysed in extraction buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.125% Tween 20, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml E64, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Equal amounts of cellular protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions in 7.5% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with polyclonal anti-Fn antibody, followed by peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. For LRP immunodetection, cell extracts were subjected to non-reducing 4–12% SDS-PAGE, and membranes were probed with monoclonal 8G1 antibody, followed by peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG. Secondary antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance-ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Monolayer cultures of MEFs and CHO cells were washed three times with ice-cold 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), to remove contaminating fetal bovine serum and other soluble proteins and then treated with the membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (0.5 mg/ml), for 15 min at 22 °C. Alternatively, cells were treated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin after dissociation from monolayer culture using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). In these experiments, the cells were pelleted, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended at 4 × 106cells/ml in Earle’s balanced salt solution (EBSS) with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing NHS-LC-biotin and proteinase inhibitors. Biotinylation reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mmglycine, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 22 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were counted and lysed in extraction buffer. Biotinylated membrane proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The affinity precipitates were recovered by centrifugation, washed, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis to detect Fn. MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells (5 × 105) were plated in 75-ml flasks in 10% fetal bovine serum-containing medium and allowed to adhere for 2 h. The medium was then replaced with serum-free DMEM containing Nutridoma NS® supplement (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and sodium bicarbonate. At various times, the cells and conditioned medium were recovered. The conditioned medium was concentrated 10-fold using Centricon units with 10-kDa exclusion limits (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Samples of conditioned medium and cells extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis to detect Fn. Fn (10 μg/ml) was immobilized in microtiter plates by incubation for 5 h at 22 °C. The wells were blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA for 1 h. Purified LRP was incubated with immobilized Fn, or in control wells without Fn, for 12 h at 4 °C. The incubation buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% (w/v) BSA, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20. In some experiments, GST-RAP was added together with the purified LRP. The wells were then washed, and bound LRP was detected with monoclonal antibody 8G1, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and the chromogenic substrate, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. Fn was radioiodinated to a specific activity of 0.5–1.0 μCi/μg using IODO-BEADS (Pierce). MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells were transferred to 24-well dishes and cultured for 24 h. After washing the cells, 125I-Fn (10 nm) in EBSS with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 5 mg/ml BSA was added. In some experiments,125I-Fn was added together with purified GST-RAP (200 nm) or a 50-fold molar excess of non-radiolabeled Fn. To detect degraded 125I-Fn as a function of time, samples of the medium were assayed for trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity. Each sample was incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C and subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the supernatant was quantitated in a γ-counter. Specific 125I-Fn degradation in MEF cultures was determined by subtracting degradation that occurred in the presence of unlabeled Fn and corrected for that which occurred in control wells that lacked cells. MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in serum-containing medium and allowed to adhere for 2 h. Depletion of intracellular methionine was achieved by culturing in l-methionine-free DMEM for 4 h. The cells were then labeled with 35 μCi/mll-[35S]methionine for 4 h in serum-containing methionine-free DMEM. Cell extracts were prepared in RIPA buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml E64, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Labeled Fn was recovered by immunoprecipitation. Radioactivity in the precipitates was determined in a scintillation counter. The precipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–16% gradients.l-[35S]Methionine incorporation into Fn was determined using a Storm system (Molecular Dynamics and Amersham Biosciences). LRP-deficient MEF-2 cells and LRP-expressing MEF-1 cells were cultured until confluent in serum-containing medium and then dissociated non-enzymatically from monolayer culture. Extracts were prepared from an equal number of cells in suspension and assessed for Fn by immunoblot analysis (Fig.1A). Fn levels were substantially increased in extracts from the LRP-deficient MEF-2 cells compared with LRP-expressing MEF-1 cells. An identical protocol was followed with LRP-deficient 13-5-1 CHO cells (49FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D.K. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and wild-type CHO-K1 cells. Once again, Fn levels were increased in the LRP-deficient cell line, compared with the control cells. Equivalent results were obtained when the amount of cell extract subjected to SDS-PAGE was standardized based on protein content instead of cell number (results not shown). Fn forms fibrils at or near the cell surface, which may be variably recovered when cells are dissociated from monolayer culture (5Yamada K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 761-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 6Mosher D.F. Annu. Rev. Med. 1984; 35: 561-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 7Hynes R.O. Fibronectins, Springer Series in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, New York1990: 200-379Google Scholar). Furthermore, Fn fibrils may be incompletely solubilized by our standard deoxycholate-containing extraction buffer. To determine whether differential recovery of Fn from MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells affected our results, cell extracts were prepared without first dissociating the cells, using either our standard extraction buffer or 1% SDS (Fig.1B). Under both sets of conditions, greatly increased levels of Fn were recovered from cultures of MEF-2 cells. When extracts were prepared in SDS, the amount of Fn recovered from the MEF-2 cells was increased by at least 20-fold, compared with that recovered from MEF-1 cells. The Fn detected by immunoblot analysis could have been derived from the cells in culture or the fetal bovine serum that was added to the medium. To distinguish between these possibilities, MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h in serum-containing medium, which was then replaced by serum-free DMEM containing Nutridoma NS® supplement. Fn that was associated with the cells and in the medium was measured as a function of time. Under these conditions, the only source of Fn is cellular synthesis. As shown in Fig.2A, cell-associated Fn was almost undetectable shortly after the cells adhered; however, Fn accumulated rapidly in the MEF-2 cell cultures. By 6 h, the level of Fn, which was recovered with MEF-2 cells, was significantly higher than that recovered with MEF-1 cells (p < 0.01). By 28 h, the difference in Fn recovery was further accentuated (p < 0.001). As shown in Fig. 2B, Fn also accumulated to increased levels in conditioned medium from LRP-deficient MEF-2 cells, compared with conditioned medium from MEF-1 cells (p < 0.01). Thus, LRP deficiency is apparently associated with increased Fn accumulation in association with cells and in solution. To determine whether the differences in Fn accumulation were due to differential rates of Fn synthesis, l-[35S]methionine metabolic labeling experiments were performed. In five separate experiments, we did not observe a significant difference in the rate of Fn synthesis between MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells (results not shown). To determine the location of Fn, which was recovered from cultures of LRP-deficient and -expressing cells, we labeled cell-surface proteins, in MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells, with the membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. Biotinylated proteins were selectively recovered from cell extracts by streptavidin affinity precipitation, and Fn was detected in the affinity precipitates by immunoblot analysis. When the cells were labeled with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin while in monolayer culture, biotinylated Fn was detected almost exclusively with the LRP-deficient MEF-2 cells (Fig. 3). Equivalent results were obtained when the MEFs were dissociated from monolayer culture, using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer, and then labeled with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in suspension. These results indicate that Fn accumulates more significantly in the extracellular spaces surrounding LRP-deficient MEF-2 cells. At least a significant fraction of the Fn is intimately associated with the MEF-2 cell membrane because the Fn partitions with MEF-2 cells that are dissociated from monolayer culture. Cell-surface biotinylation experiments were also performed using another model system, by comparing LRP-deficient 13-5-1 CHO cells and wild-type CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 4). Once again, the membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent selectively labeled Fn in the LRP-deficient cell line. Equivalent results were obtained regardless of whether the sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin reacted with cells in monolayer culture or with cells in suspension. LRP undergoes rapid and constitutive endocytosis and recycling, delivering many ligands to lysosomes for degradation (36Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that LRP functions as a catabolic receptor for Fn, which might explain the increase in cell-associated Fn in LRP-deficient cells. To test this hypothesis,125I-Fn was incubated with MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells at 37 °C. Fn degradation was detected by measuring trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the medium. Fig. 5 shows that LRP-expressing MEF-1 cells degraded 125I-Fn at a significantly increased rate compared with MEF-2 cells (p < 0.01).125I-Fn degradation was specific because a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled Fn blocked 125I-Fn degradation by greater than 90%. To confirm that 125I-Fn degradation by MEF-1 cells resulted from the activity of LRP, we added 200 nm GST-RAP to the cultures together with125I-Fn. GST-RAP binds directly to LRP and inhibits the binding of all other known LRP ligands (40Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Gliemann J. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Jorgensen K.E. Nielsen M. Andreasen P.A. Christensen E.I. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Moestrup S.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 20-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 42Bu G. Marzolo M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, GST-RAP significantly inhibited specific 125I-Fn degradation by MEF-1 cells (p < 0.01), decreasing the rate to that observed with LRP-deficient cells. By contrast,125I-Fn degradation by MEF-2 cells was not altered by GST-RAP, which was an anticipated result because MEF-2 cells do not express LRP. These results demonstrate that LRP mediates the catabolism of Fn and may alter cellular Fn accumulation by this mechanism. Two possibilities were envisioned whereby LRP might promote Fn degradation. The first and most straightforward would involve direct binding of Fn to LRP so that the Fn is internalized by the cell and transferred to lysosomes. The second possibility is that LRP regulates the level of another plasma membrane protein, which in turn functions as a true catabolic receptor for Fn. To test whether Fn binds directly to LRP, we immobilized Fn in microtiter plates. Purified LRP demonstrated concentration-dependent binding to immobilized Fn and not to immobilized BSA in control wells (Fig.6). GST-RAP blocked the interaction of purified LRP with immobilized Fn, providing evidence that the Fn-LRP interaction is specific. The inhibitory activity of GST-RAP was RAP concentration-dependent. From the results presented thus far, a model emerges in which LRP binds and internalizes Fn, promoting its degradation in lysosomes. LRP may also regulate levels of other plasma membrane proteins that function in Fn degradation or Fn fibril assembly. To confirm that the difference in Fn accumulation in MEF-1 and MEF-2 cultures was due to LRP, MEF-1 cells were treated with RAP, and MEF-2 cells were transfected to express LRP. If LRP is responsible for the observed differences in cell-associated Fn, then blocking the function of LRP with RAP should promote Fn accumulation. Conversely, stable expression of LRP in MEF-2 cells should inhibit Fn accumulation. We confirmed that B41 cells, which are MEF-2 cells transfected with a cDNA construct encoding full-length human LRP, express LRP by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7B, we also demonstrated that B41 cells internalize the LRP ligand, α2-macroglobulin, which was purified and converted into its receptor-recognized conformation, as described previously (46Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of α2-macroglobulin internalization was similar to that observed with heterozygous LRP-deficient MEFs (PEA-10 cells). These results demonstrate that LRP is functional in B41 cells. When MEF-1 cells were cultured in the presence of 200 nmGST-RAP for 28 h, the level of cell-associated Fn was significantly increased, compared with cells that were cultured in the presence of 200 nm GST, as a control (Fig. 7C). An increase in Fn accumulation in conditioned medium was also observed (Fig. 7D). The amount of Fn detected in association with RAP-treated MEF-1 cells was comparable with that detected in LRP-deficient MEF-2 cells. These results support our model in which LRP functions to inhibit Fn accumulation on cell surfaces. B41 cells demonstrated substantially decreased Fn accumulation in the cell-associated fraction and in conditioned medium, compared with MEF-2 cells, further supporting the model. The function of LRP and other proteins in the LDL receptor family, as endocytic receptors, is rather complicated at a number of levels. First, the breadth of ligands, which bind to LRP and are subsequently internalized, is extremely large (36Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). In some cases, LRP may bind complex ligands with potentially profound effects on cell physiology. For example, LRP may internalize growth factors including transforming growth factor-β and platelet-derived growth factor-BB that are bound to the primary LRP ligand, α2-macroglobulin (50LaMarre J. Hayes M.A. Wollenberg G.K. Hussaini I.M. Hall S.W. Gonias S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 51Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. LaMarre J. Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similarly, LRP mediates the endocytosis of matrix metalloproteinase 2 in association with another primary ligand, thrombospondin 2 (52Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). There are a number of examples in which LRP functions as a catabolic receptor for a protein that binds first to another cell-surface site. Lipoprotein lipase and thrombin-protease nexin 1 are most frequently internalized by LRP after binding to cell surface heparan sulfates (53Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Wong H. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,54Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and collagenase 3 probably binds to a distinct cell-surface receptor prior to interacting with LRP (55Barmina O.Y. Walling H.W. Fiacco G.J. Freije J.M.P. Lopez-Otin C. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30087-30093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Perhaps most interestingly, LRP may regulate plasma membrane levels of other receptors. The most commonly described mechanism involves internalization of multimeric complexes, in which one ligand bridges LRP to another plasma membrane receptor. The ligand and bridged receptor then undergo endocytosis with LRP. This mechanism is operational for uPA-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex, which binds simultaneously to uPAR and LRP or the VLDL receptor, promoting uPAR internalization (45Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H. Sankovic M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 56Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). As a result of this process, cell-surface levels of uPAR are typically decreased in LRP-expressing cells (35Weaver A.M. McCabe M. Kim I. Allietta M.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24894-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 57Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H.D. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 123-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, LRP may mediate the internalization of tissue factor via the bridging ligand, factor VIIa-tissue factor pathway inhibitor complex (58Hamik A. Bu H. Setiada G. McEver R.P. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4962-4969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Fn has the capacity to interact with the cell surface by binding to multiple macromolecules, including integrins and glycosaminoglycans (8Yamada K.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Koide A. Bailey C.W. Huang X. Koide S. J. Mol.

Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar); however, pathways that are responsible for Fn clearance from the extracellular spaces remain unclear. Because Fn is a major cell adhesion molecule that regulates cell signaling, pathways that alter cell-surface levels of Fn have the potential to impact on diverse aspects of cell physiology, including cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this study, we identified LRP as a catabolic receptor for Fn. Direct binding of Fn to purified LRP was demonstrated, suggesting that Fn may bind directly to LRP in intact cells. However, it is also possible that Fn binds first to another cell-surface site and then to LRP in a second step. The characterization of Fn as an LRP ligand is intriguing because thrombospondins are the only other previously described ECM proteins that interact with LDL receptor family members (59Godyna S. Liau G. Popa I. Stefansson S. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 60Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In cells that are LRP-deficient, Fn accumulated to greatly increased levels. Our cell-surface biotinylation experiments studies suggest that the Fn is accumulating outside the cell, on the cell surface and in association with the ECM that forms surrounding LRP-deficient cells in culture. The ability of RAP to substantially increase Fn accumulation in MEF-1 cells supports the hypothesis that LRP-mediated Fn catabolism is directly linked to the differences in Fn accumulation observed in LRP-expressing and deficient cells. However, at the present time, other mechanisms cannot be excluded. For example, Aguirre-Ghiso et al. (61Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Liu D. Mignatti A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 863-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) demonstrated that uPAR may associate with α5β1, promoting the formation of cell-associated Fn fibrils. Because LRP decreases cell-surface levels of uPAR (35Weaver A.M. McCabe M. Kim I. Allietta M.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

LRP-deficient CHO 13-5-1 cells demonstrated increased Fn accumulation compared with LRP-expressing CHO-K1 cells, thus providing support for our hypothesis regarding the function of LRP in Fn catabolism in a second model system. The function of LRP as a regulator of Fn accumulation in both MEFs and CHO cells suggests that LRP may have an equivalent role in diverse cell types. In addition to LRP, CHO cells express the VLDL receptor, which is partially homologous to LRP in function (62Mikhailenko, I., Considine, W., Argraves, K. M., Loukinov, D., Hyman, B. T., and Strickland, D. K. (1999) 112,3269–3281Google Scholar). Ligands that bind to LRP and not to the VLDL receptor include α2-macroglobulin and Pseudomonasexotoxin A (46Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D.

The increase in Fn accumulation in association with CHO 13-5-1 cells may suggest a selective role for LRP in Fn regulation; however, the activity of other LDL receptor homologues in this process should be taken into consideration and remains to be determined. The relationship between cell-surface Fn and oncogenic transformation and cancer progression is intriguing but remains incompletely understood. Reduced cell-associated Fn levels may be linked to oncogenic transformation (64Akamatsu H. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Ozono K. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Sekiguchi K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4541-4546PubMed Google Scholar). However, cell-associated Fn fibrils may suppress the activity of p38MAPK, leading to an increase in the activity of the MAP kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and increased cancer cell proliferation (61Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Liu D. Mignatti A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 863-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity may also inhibit cancer cell apoptosis (65Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Taksu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated an association between LRP deficiency and increased cell migration on vitronectin- and fibronectin-coated surfaces. MEF-2 cells migrate more rapidly than MEF-1 cells on vitronectin (35Weaver A.M. McCabe M. Kim I. Allietta M.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24894-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HT 1080 cells, which express an LRP antisense RNA expression construct and are thus LRP-efficient, migrate more rapidly than LRP-expressing HT 1080 cells (57Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H.D. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 123-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, MCF-7 breast cancer cells, HT 1080 cells, and normal human fibroblasts that are cultured in RAP for 3–5 days, so that sustained neutralization of LRP or the VLDL receptor is achieved, also migrate more rapidly on vitronectin and fibronectin (45Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H. Sankovic M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 57Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H.D. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 123-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all of these systems, LRP deficiency or neutralization of an LDL receptor homologue is associated with increased cell-surface uPAR levels and increased accumulation of endogenously produced uPA in conditioned medium. Furthermore, in RAP-treated MCF-7 cells and in antisense RNA-expressing HT 1080 cells, we have directly linked the increase in activity of the uPA/uPAR system to increased migration. However, in smooth muscle cells, LRP neutralization inhibits cell migration (66Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that a uPAR-independent process may be operative. The effects of LRP on Fn accumulation represent a feasible mechanism whereby LRP may regulate cell migration. Similarly, LRP may regulate smooth muscle cell migration based on its ability to function as a receptor for apolipoprotein E (63Bu D.K. Swertfeger G. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4141-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Understanding the full impact of Fn regulation by LRP, on cell phenotype, is an important goal for future studies."

The role of the CFTR channel in the regulation of the intracellular pathways that determine the overexpression of mucin genes is unknown. Using differential display, we have observed the differential expression of several mRNAs that may correspond to putative CFTR-dependent genes. One of these mRNAs was further characterized, and it corresponds to the tyrosine kinase c-Src. Additional results suggest that c-Src is a central element in the pathway connecting the CFTR channel with MUC1 overexpression and that the overexpression of mucins is a primary response to CFTR malfunction in cystic fibrosis, which occurs even in the absence of bacterial infection.

Within the respiratory system, the main issue has been the difficulty in establishing whether mucin overexpression is a response to subsequent infections withPseudomonas aeruginosa or whether failure of the CFTR channel is indeed primarily responsible for this overexpression. To determine the mechanisms involved in mucin overexpression is extremely important for therapy, since its early control may decrease the patient's susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection (3.Pilewski J.M.

HT29 cells (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, ATCC HTB-38) and FHC cells (epithelial cells from normal human fetal colonic mucosa, ATTC CRL-1831) were cultured under the same conditions. Differential display (DD) of mRNA was carried out as described by Liang and Pardee (4.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4698) Google Scholar, 5.Liang P. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), with some modifications to avoid false positive results (9.Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 42: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). For the assay, total mRNA was isolated from CFDE cells, CFDE/6RepCFTR cells, and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells treated with the Cl− transport inhibitor 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB; 100 μm, 4 h), which causes these cells to revert to a CF phenotype. The oligonucleotide primers were 5′-GTGACATGCC-3′ (random primer) and 5′-T12(ACG)C-3′. The cDNA fragments isolated after DD were cloned into a pGem-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) containing flanking EcoRI sites. The cloned plasmid was digested with restriction enzyme (EcoRI) to prepare32P-labeled probes for Northern blots, as previously described (9.Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 42: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, 5′-CAGAGGCGACCTCTGCAT-3′, complementary to nucleotides 1–18 of CFTR mRNA, was used to inhibit the expression of CFTR protein (10.Wagner J.A. McDonald T.V. Nghiem P.T. Lowe A.W. Schulman H. Gruenert D.C. Stryer L. Gardner P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The corresponding sense oligodeoxynucleotide was used as a control. CFDE and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells were cultured to 30–40% confluence. After growth, the medium was removed, and the oligonucleotides (10 μm) in serum-free medium, were added to the cells. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C with the oligonucleotides, heat-inactivated serum (final concentration 10%) was added to the medium. The same procedure was used to replenish the oligodeoxynucleotides (10 μm) every 12 h for 48 h (10.Wagner J.A. McDonald T.V. Nghiem P.T. Lowe A.W. Schulman H. Gruenert D.C. Stryer L. Gardner P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Proteins from CFDE and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells, cultured for 1 day in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, were isolated using the Trizol kit from Invitrogen. Western blots were then performed as previously described (11.Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Giordano L. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1500: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), using antibodies for c-Src (rabbit polyclonal, N-terminal pp60c-Src-specific; catalog no. sc-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and c-Yes (rabbit polyclonal, N-terminal pp62-Yes specific; catalog no. sc14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). c-Src activity was measured using a commercial kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) that includes a synthetic peptide substrate (KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK) specific for the c-Src family of kinases (12.Cheng H. Nishio H. Hatase O. Ralph S. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9248-9256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), following the instructions of the manufacturer. The cells were lysed, and the protein was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total cellular proteins, as described by Dehm et al. (13.Dehm S. Senger M.A. Bonham K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), using a specific rabbit anti-c-Src polyclonal IgG (rabbit polyclonal, N-terminal pp60c-Src-specific; catalog no. sc-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Additional samples were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against pp62c-Yes (rabbit polyclonal, N-terminal pp62-Yes-specific; catalog no. sc14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), another member of the Src family of kinases, and the activity of c-Yes was measured with the same substrate. CFDE and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells were cultured on coverslips (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) coated with a fibronectin-collagen solution, as described previously (14.Kunzelmann K. Legendre J.Y. Knoell D.L. Escobar L.C. Xu Z. Gruenert D.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 859-867PubMed Google Scholar). After culture, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) at room temperature and fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution containing 4% sucrose in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and the cells were exposed to polyclonal primary antibodies (1:30; sc-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin. Control and CF human lung slices (corresponding to seven patients with CF) were obtained as paraffin tissue sections (5 μm). The sections were stained with Giemsa (1:10 diluted Giemsa staining solution from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany)). Microwave pretreatment was performed following the technical protocols from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and the slices were exposed to polyclonal primary antibodies (1:30; sc-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin. The slices or cells were then rinsed with PBS, incubated with secondary antibody (1:100) for 1 h, rinsed again with PBS, and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate (Invitrogen). The primary antibodies directed against c-Src (sc-19) and MUC1 (a goat polyclonal IgG that is specific for the MUC1 C-terminal and does not react with MUC2 or MUC3; catalog no. sc-6827) and the secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat IgG) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the other secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG, was from Sigma. To test the effect of the c-Src inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2; 10 μm, 48 h) on MUC1 expression in CFDE cells, the same procedure was used. To test the effects of NPPB (100 μm, 24 h), glibenclamide (50 μm, 24 h), and CFTR antisense oligonucleotide (10 μm, 48 h) on MUC1 expression in CFDE and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells, the same primary antibody against MUC1 was used (MUC1 C-terminal-specific goat polyclonal IgG), followed by labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked secondary donkey anti-goat IgG (catalog no. sc-2024; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and cells were observed under confocal fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss LSM510 microscope). CFDE cells grown as described above were transfected with different concentrations of a plasmid encoding a c-Src dominant negative mutant (0, 0.5, 1, and 3 μg/ml) and with a plasmid containing WT c-Src (6 μg/ml) to overexpress the c-Src protein (15.Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). As a control, the empty plasmid was transfected. For transfection, the ProFection Mammalian Transfection System-Calcium Phosphate kit was used (Promega), following the protocols included in the kit. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS at room temperature and fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution containing 4% sucrose in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Immunocytochemical analysis for MUC1 protein was performed. Confocal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used, as described below, to determine MUC1 mRNA levels, with slides prepared and treated as described above. To determine MUC1 mRNA levels, confocal FISH was performed as described by other authors (16.Shestakova E.A. Singer R.H. Condeelis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7045-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. CFDE and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells were cultured on coverslips as described above and treated with plasmids encoding WT c-Src (6 μg/ml) or the dominant negative mutant of c-Src (6 μg/ml). The probe, biotin-TCATGGTGGTGGTGAAATGGGTGGGGAGGGGGCAGAACAGATTCAAGCAGCCAGGGAATTC (61 bp), was designed using the GCG program (Accelrys, Madison, WI) to hybridize to MUC1 mRNA. After in situ hybridization, the cells were visualized using streptavidin-Cy3 and observed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Northern blots, immunocytochemical preparations, and Western blots were scanned with an HP4C scanner and quantified using NIH Image software (available on the World Wide Web at www.scioncorp.com). Densitometric analysis for immunocytochemical preparations was performed as described previously (17.von Olleschik-Elbheim L. el Baya A. Schmidt M.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 197: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Sample loading for Northern blots was quantified using methylene blue staining. A linear dose response to staining was observed up to 40 μg of total RNA (11.Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Giordano L. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1500: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The figures are representative of at least four different results performed in duplicate. Analysis of variance and Tukey tests were used for statistical analysis. We used differential display to test the hypothesis that CFTR is involved in other complex functions besides chloride transport, such as indirect gene regulation. Several previously described strategies were applied to avoid false positive/negative results (9.Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 42: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). As a model system, we used a cultured cell line derived from a CF patient (CFDE cells) and the same cell line transfected with WT CFTR (CFDE/6RepCFTR cells) (14.Kunzelmann K. Legendre J.Y. Knoell D.L. Escobar L.C. Xu Z. Gruenert D.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 859-867PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CFDE/6RepCFTR cells were treated with the chloride channel inhibitor 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) (18.Zhang Z.R. Zeltwanger S. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19.Walsh K.B. Long K.J. Shen X. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Using this model system, we were able to show that several genes might be under CFTR control. As shown in Fig. 1 A, several differentially expressed mRNAs were detected in CFDE and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells. As expected, after NPPB treatment, the differential display pattern of some mRNAs, probably regulated by CFTR activity, reverted in the CFDE/6RepCFTR cells, becoming similar to the pattern found in CFDE cells. The characterization of these putative CFTR-dependent genes will open the way to a better understanding of CF pathology and the mechanisms involved and help identify new possible targets for therapy. One gene that was overexpressed in CFDE cells compared with CFDE/6RepCFTR cells and that reverted to CFDE levels with NPPB treatment of CFDE/6RepCFTR cells was selected for further characterization. The corresponding cDNA fragment (Fig. 1 A, arrow) was isolated from the differential display gel, PCR-amplified, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, cloned, and sequenced (9.Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 42: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence (Fig. 1 B) was identical to the sequence encoding the human tyrosine kinase c-Src (pp60c-Src, GenBank™AF077754). Northern blots were probed with the 32P-radiolabeled cDNA fragment isolated by DD and confirmed the differential expression of c-Src mRNA in CFDE cells (Fig. 1 C). Since NPPB is not CFTR-specific, these results were further confirmed by treatment of CFDE/6RepCFTR cells with a CFTR antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits CFTR protein expression and the cAMP-activated chloride current but does not affect the calcium-activated chloride currents (10.Wagner J.A. McDonald T.V. Nghiem P.T. Lowe A.W. Schulman H. Gruenert D.C. Stryer L. Gardner P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The CFTR antisense oligonucleotide produced a reversion to c-Src mRNA levels similar to those obtained with NPPB (Fig. 1 C). These results are in agreement with the concept that c-Src mRNA is modulated by CFTR. We next examined whether the c-Src protein levels correlate with mRNA levels and are modulated by CFTR. Western blot analysis applied to CFDE and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells indicated that this is the case (Fig. 2 A). Levels of c-Src protein (pp60c-Src) increased in CFDE cells (cystic fibrosis cells) compared with CFDE/6RepCFTR (expressing normal CFTR protein). Treatment with glibenclamide (50 μm, 48 h), a CFTR chloride channel inhibitor (20.Hwang T.C. Sheppard D.N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), restored the c-Src protein levels in CFDE/6RepCFTR cells to levels similar to those found in CFDE cells (Fig. 2,A and B). In contrast, c-Yes, another member of the Src-like family of kinases and very closely related to Src, showed no change in protein levels between CFDE and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells (Fig. 2 A) or with glibenclamide treatment (Fig. 2 B). Since CF also affects the intestinal tract, we also studied c-Src protein levels in the HT29 colon cell line (transformed colon cells) and the FHC cell line (nontransformed colon cells), blocking CFTR activity with glibenclamide (50 μm, 48 h) (20.Hwang T.C. Sheppard D.N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The levels of c-Src protein increased in FHC, HT29, and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells after glibenclamide treatment (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the regulation of c-Src protein by CFTR occurs not only in airway CFDE cells but also in other cell types expressing WT CFTR. The c-Src-like kinase, c-Yes, did not show changes in FHC cells with or without glibenclamide (50 μm, 48 h) (Fig. 2 B), indicating again that the levels of c-Yes are not dependent on CFTR activity. Src-like tyrosine kinases contain N-terminal Src homology 2 and 3 domains, the kinase domain, and the regulatory domain that contains a tyrosine residue (Tyr-527 for c-Src). An additional regulatory tyrosine residue (Tyr-192 for c-Src) is present in the Src homology 2 domain. The activity of Src kinases is generally tightly regulated by phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine residue through C-terminal Src kinase (Csk kinase) (21.Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Superti-Furga G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2317-2329PubMed Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of this residue induces a conformational change that activates the kinase domain, inducing the autophosphorylation of a stimulatory tyrosine in the kinase domain (Tyr-416 for Src) (for a review of Src, see Ref. 22.Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). For this reason, increased expression of c-Src does not necessarily imply that c-Src kinase activity also increases. To determine whether the elevated levels of c-Src mRNA and protein observed in CF cells were reflected in c-Src activity, c-Src activity was measured using a peptide substrate (KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK) specific for the Src family of kinases (12.Cheng H. Nishio H. Hatase O. Ralph S. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9248-9256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assure specificity, c-Src was first immunoprecipitated using a specific polyclonal antibody. In agreement with elevated mRNA and protein levels, a significant (p < 0.001) 5-fold increase in c-Src kinase activity was observed in CFDE cells compared with CFDE/6RepCFTR cells (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, under the same assay conditions, immunoprecipitated c-Yes displayed low activity, similar to basal c-Src, with no difference in activity between CFDE and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells (Fig. 2 C), implying that c-Yes activity and protein levels (as shown previously by immunoblotting) are not up-regulated by CFTR in these cells. Nevertheless, other members of the Src-like family of kinases might still be under CFTR regulation (particularly c-Fyn; see “Discussion”) (23.Esen M. Grassme H. Riethmuller J. Riehle A. Fassbender K. Gulbins E. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). c-Src activity was also measured in CFDE cells and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells treated with glibenclamide (50 μm, 48 h). As shown in Fig. 2 D, the low activity observed in CFDE/6RepCFTR cells was partially restored to CFDE values by glibenclamide treatment (in some experiments, restoration was 100%, but only the average is shown). To determine whether the overexpression of c-Src observed in CFDE cells is actually reflected in the CF human airway, the expression of c-Src protein was studied by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 2 E, overexpression of c-Src was observed in human lung tissue derived from CF patients (six other patients were studied with similar results, not shown), suggesting that c-Src is also overexpressed in vivo. However, it is clearly still possible that the secondary effects of infection with P. aeruginosacontribute to the observed high levels of c-Src in these patients (23.Esen M. Grassme H. Riethmuller J. Riehle A. Fassbender K. Gulbins E. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,24.Li J.D. Feng W. Gallup M. Kim J.H. Gum J. Kim Y. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5718-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggested to us that the mucin MUC1 might be elevated as a consequence of the up-regulation of c-Src (see “Discussion”). To test this hypothesis, the levels of MUC1 protein in CFDE and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells were determined using immunocytochemistry. As expected, MUC1 was overexpressed in CFDE cells compared with CFDE/6RepCFTR cells (Fig. 3). Most importantly, CFDE cells treated with the c-Src inhibitor PP2 (25.Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar) showed decreased MUC1 expression (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that this phenomenon was not only a correlation but also a cause-effect relationship. To confirm this, CFDE cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing a dominant negative mutant of c-Src, and again, MUC1 was inhibited (Fig. 4 B), with the inhibition following a clear dose-response curve (Fig. 4 C). Because simultaneous inhibition of other members of the c-Src family by the c-Src dominant negative mutant was a possibility, the up-regulation of MUC1 by c-Src was further supported by transfection of CFDE/6RepCFTR cells with a plasmid containing WT c-Src. Again, increased MUC1 protein expression was observed (Fig. 5). These results strongly suggest that MUC1 expression is under the control of c-Src in these CF cells.Figure 4c-Src activity modulates MUC1 expression.

As shown in Fig. 6, CFDE cells showed high levels of MUC1 mRNA compared with CFDE/6RepCFTR cells. As expected from the results obtained for MUC1 protein expression, the c-Src dominant negative mutant caused down-regulation of MUC1 mRNA in CFDE cells. Furthermore, transfection of CFDE/6RepCFTR with WT c-Src restored these cells to a CF phenotype, with increased MUC1 mRNA expression (Fig. 6). These results imply that MUC1 mRNA levels are also under c-Src control. We have shown in the results described above that CFTR is associated with c-Src modulation and that c-Src in turn modulates MUC1 levels. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that c-Src constitutes a bridge between CFTR failure and MUC1 overexpression (CFTR → c-Src → MUC1), the chloride transport inhibitors NPPB (100 μm, 24 h) and glibenclamide (50 μm, 24 h) were added to CFDE and CFDE/6RepCFTR cells, and the MUC1 protein levels were assessed after 24 h using confocal fluorescence microscopy. As expected, overexpression of MUC1 was observed in CFDE/6RepCFTR cells after treatment with either NPPB or glibenclamide (Fig. 7). The levels of MUC1 protein attained after the inhibition of chloride transport in CFDE/6RepCFTR cells were similar to those found in CFDE cells. It should be pointed out here that, although glibenclamide is a more specific CFTR inhibitor than the nonspecific Cl− channel inhibitor, NPPB (26.Ito Y. Mizuno Y. Aoyama M. Kume H. Yamaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it may also affect other sulfonylurea-sensitive ion channels, such as the ATP-dependent potassium channel (27.Liu X. Singh B.B. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25121-25129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm these results, CFDE/6RepCFTR cells were treated with 10 μm CFTR antisense oligonucleotide for 48 h, to inhibit the expression of CFTR protein. The results (Fig. 7) were in agreement with those obtained with NPPB and glibenclamide, further supporting the CFTR → c-Src → MUC1 link. These cell cultures, however, lack polarization. Therefore, the results should be accepted with caution because the expression of CFTR and MUC1 may be different in culture-polarized cells. Applying differential display to CFDE (human CF cells) and CFDE/6RepCFTR (human CF cells transfected with WT CFTR) cells, we found differential expression of different genes that may be under CFTR regulation, as the lower or higher levels of several of the genes products observed in CFDE/6RepCFTR cells reverted to CFDE levels after treatment with the chloride channel inhibitor, NPPB. Among these gene products, we selected one for further characterization; it proved to encode the tyrosine kinase c-Src. Overexpression of c-Src mRNA in CFDE cells was confirmed by Northern blots, and the low levels of c-Src mRNA in CFDE/6RepCFTR cells reverted to the levels seen in CFDE cells when either antisense CFTR or NPPB was applied. This last result suggests an association between the levels of c-Src mRNA and CFTR transport activity, although NPPB might also affect the interaction of CFTR with other CFTR-interacting proteins.

However, AS is the first gene identified that is activated by the AAR and the ER stress response pathway through the same cis-elements, termed nutrient-sensing response elements-1,2 (NSRE-1, NSRE-2). The first analysis of amino acid-dependent control of the human AS gene was triggered by the observation that a mutation in AS led to a block in G1 phase of the cell cycle (13.Greco A. Gong S.S. Ittmann M. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Those studies led Guerrini et al. (14.Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to identify an amino acid responsive sequence in the proximal promoter, which corresponds to the NSRE-1 site shown by Barbosa-Tessman et al. (4.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) also noted two GC boxes and postulated, based on sequence only, that they may be binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1. Those authors showed that when the GC boxes were deleted, the rate for basal transcription was reduced.More recently, in vivo footprinting analysis by Barbosa- Tessmann et al. (5.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified six putative protein-binding sites in the AS proximal promoter region, five of which are thought to be important for metabolite control. Three of these sites are GC-rich sequences, referred to as GC-I (nt −148 to −139), GC-II (nt −128 to −119), and GC-III (nt −107 to −97). The other two sites, NSRE-1 and NSRE-2, are responsible for increasing transcription following amino acid or glucose limitation (4.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S.

Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that after mutating either of the NSRE both basal and induced transcription were significantly reduced. Those authors also showed that if all three GC boxes were deleted, both basal and nutrient-regulated transcription were reduced significantly (5.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deleting both GC-I and GC-II, while retaining GC-III, reduced basal transcription, but the induction following amino acid or glucose deprivation still occurred. However, when GC-III was mutated in the presence of functional copies of both GC-I and GC-II, basal and regulated transcriptional roles were unaffected, suggesting possible redundancy between the three GC boxes.Given the GC-rich sequence of sites I-III, occupation by one of the Sp family of proteins is possible, if not probable. Sp1 was the first protein identified (15.Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar) in a family of proteins that recognizes a similar binding sequence and is involved in regulating the transcription of many genes (reviewed in Refs. 16.Lania L. Majello B. DeLuca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17.Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). In recent years, other members of the family have been identified. Sp2 has been reported to bind a GT-rich box instead of a GC-rich sequence, whereas Sp3 and Sp4 are known to bind with similar affinity to a sequence that can also be recognized by Sp1.This report shows that each of the three GC boxes within the human AS proximal promoter are required to maintain the highest basal transcription rates and that they act as modulators to allow maximal activation via the NSRE sites following nutrient deprivation. There is a hierarchy in the relative contribution of the GC boxes (GC-III > GC-II > GC-I), indicating that their relative importance is not completely redundant. As a minimum, at least one functional GC box is needed for maximal induction of AS transcription by amino acid deprivation. Two of the GC boxes were able to form protein-DNA complexes in vitro with either Sp1 or Sp3. In amino acid-limited cells, the absolute amounts of Sp1 and Sp3 were unchanged, but a portion of the Sp1 protein was phosphorylated. In vivo, when Sp1 was expressed in an Sp-negative background, it increased the basal transcriptional activity of the AS promoter but did not increase the transcriptional rate following amino acid deprivation. In contrast, Sp3 was capable of enhancing both the basal and the starvation-induced activation of the AS promoter.DISCUSSIONMammalian AS is a model for gene regulation by nutrient availability. This report demonstrates that binding of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins plays an important role in both the basal and the metabolite-regulated transcription of the human AS gene. In vivo footprinting had documented constitutive protein binding at three GC-rich sequences within the 5′ upstream region of the human AS gene (5.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although in vivo footprinting is a powerful tool to show binding site occupancy in the intact cell, it does not identify the protein bound. Based on site-directed mutagenesis and transient transfection assays, the present data show that at least one of these three GC-boxes is necessary to maintain high rates of transcription, and all three are required to ensure maximal transcription from the AS promoter. Mutagenesis of these elements individually or in pairs indicated that there is a hierarchy based on their ability to maintain the basal transcription rate as well as to support the induction of transcription by amino acid limitation. GC-III (nt −107 to −97), the one most proximal to the two known nutrient responsive elements NSRE-1 and NSRE-2, is the most effective of all three, followed by GC-II (nt −128 to −119), and then GC-I (nt −148 to −139). When all three GC-boxes were mutated simultaneously, the basal transcription rate was only about 20% of that observed for the wild-type sequence, and although transcriptional activation following amino acid deprivation was still detectable, the absolute rate was nearly half that in the presence of all three GC boxes. When one (Fig. 2) or two (Fig. 3) of the GC boxes were mutated, both basal and nutrient-regulated transcription was affected. In fact, there are two ways to consider the data. First, if the fold-induction relative to the MEM-incubated cells is considered for each mutant, the value is actually greater in some of the mutants than it is for the wild-type sequence, demonstrating that the GC boxes are not absolutely necessary for a nutrient-regulated response to occur. On the other hand, in terms of absolute transcription rates, the numerical value for the reduction of basal transcription was always less than the decrease observed for the stimulated condition, so one would argue that the GC boxes make a positive contribution to the actual transcription rates achieved following amino acid limitation. The question that could be debated is whether the quantitative decrease in the absolute rates of starvation-induced transcription is more important than the difference between the basal and stimulated rates (i.e. the fold-induction). In either case, the mutagenesis results demonstrate that the GC-rich elements serve to establish the degree of responsiveness to nutrient deprivation by modulating the level of regulated transcription mediated by the NSRE-1 and NSRE-2 sequences.The present data also extend previous in vivo footprinting results (5.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by documenting that two of the GC boxes, GC-II and GC-III, form protein-DNA complexes in vitro. This pattern of three primary protein-DNA complexes is consistent with that seen by other investigators using GC-rich sequences as a probe, and the Sp1 (complex-1 and Sp3 (complex-2 and complex-3) composition of these complexes has been documented (17.Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Footprinting of the AS promoter region corresponding to GC-I suggested constitutive protein bindingin vivo (5.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason that GC-I failed to form a complexin vitro is not clear, but it is possible that the protein that binds at the GC-I site might require occupancy at other sites in the promoter as a prerequisite. Sp1 association with complex-1 and Sp3 with complex-2 and complex-3 was the same regardless of whether the radiolabeled probe contained the GC-II or GC-III sequence. These results demonstrate that these two elements are qualitatively similar in their binding specificity, but the mutagenesis data document that they are not identical functionally. The inability of each antibody to supershift the same complex indicates that Sp1 and Sp3 are not components of the same complex. Furthermore, the results for the nuclear extracts from control and histidine-deprived cells were the same with regard to the migration rate of the complexes, the absolute amount of each complex, and the Sp1/Sp3 composition of each complex. These in vitro results are consistent with the in vivo footprinting data indicating that protein binding at these sites was not altered by amino acid availability (5.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The in vivo expression studies illustrate that Sp1 and Sp3 are not functionally equivalent with regard to the ability to modulate nutrient control of AS gene transcription. In vivostudies using Sp-deficient Drosophila SL2 cells demonstrated that expression of either Sp1 or the full-length Sp3 were capable of enhancing basal AS transcription. The electrophoresis mobility shift assay data indicated that both proteins can bind to either GC-II or GC-III, but that they are not simultaneously bound to the same complex at either site. Together these results suggest that the SL2 cell core transcription machinery is capable of recognizing two different complexes, either one containing Sp1 or one containing Sp3, to initiate basal transcription from the AS promoter. However, given that only Sp3, not Sp1, could enhance the starvation-induced transcription in response to amino acid limitation, it appears that the two proteins are not functionally equivalent in their ability to interact (directly or indirectly) with the NSRE-1/NSRE-2 binding proteins. Also, given that the absolute nuclear content of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins in HepG2 cells did not change following histidine deprivation, a change in the ratio of Sp1/Sp3 does not appear to be responsible for regulation of the AS gene, as reported for other genes (27.Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. Wu X. Peterson C.A. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26087-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, the observation that a small, but detectable portion of Sp1 is phosphorylated by amino acid limitation suggests that this posttranslational modification might have a role in Sp1 function under these conditions.Collectively, the results presented in this report document the importance of a series of three GC-rich cis-elements in modulating the transcription driven by the human AS promoter, both the basal and the nutrient-regulated activity. The results also represent the first demonstration that: 1) both Sp1 and Sp3 can bind to these two AS promoter sites, 2) Sp1 and Sp3 do not appear to be part of a common complex, 3) the amount of Sp1 or Sp3 bound does not change in controlversus amino acid-deprived cells, and 4) in vivo, Sp1 and Sp3 are not functionally equivalent in their ability to regulate nutrient control of the human AS gene. Future studies should unravel the relationship and possible interactions between Sp1/Sp3 binding and the trans-factors that bind at the nutrient sensing response cis-elements within the AS promoter. Metabolite control of gene transcription in mammalian cells is an important factor in regulating protein expression in response to nutrient changes in the environment.

However, AS is the first gene identified that is activated by the AAR and the ER stress response pathway through the same cis-elements, termed nutrient-sensing response elements-1,2 (NSRE-1, NSRE-2). The first analysis of amino acid-dependent control of the human AS gene was triggered by the observation that a mutation in AS led to a block in G1 phase of the cell cycle (13.Greco A. Gong S.S.

Three of these sites are GC-rich sequences, referred to as GC-I (nt −148 to −139), GC-II (nt −128 to −119), and GC-III (nt −107 to −97). The other two sites, NSRE-1 and NSRE-2, are responsible for increasing transcription following amino acid or glucose limitation (4.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that after mutating either of the NSRE both basal and induced transcription were significantly reduced. Those authors also showed that if all three GC boxes were deleted, both basal and nutrient-regulated transcription were reduced significantly (5.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deleting both GC-I and GC-II, while retaining GC-III, reduced basal transcription, but the induction following amino acid or glucose deprivation still occurred. However, when GC-III was mutated in the presence of functional copies of both GC-I and GC-II, basal and regulated transcriptional roles were unaffected, suggesting possible redundancy between the three GC boxes. Given the GC-rich sequence of sites I-III, occupation by one of the Sp family of proteins is possible, if not probable. Sp1 was the first protein identified (15.Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar) in a family of proteins that recognizes a similar binding sequence and is involved in regulating the transcription of many genes (reviewed in Refs. 16.Lania L. Majello B. DeLuca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17.Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). In recent years, other members of the family have been identified. Sp2 has been reported to bind a GT-rich box instead of a GC-rich sequence, whereas Sp3 and Sp4 are known to bind with similar affinity to a sequence that can also be recognized by Sp1. This report shows that each of the three GC boxes within the human AS proximal promoter are required to maintain the highest basal transcription rates and that they act as modulators to allow maximal activation via the NSRE sites following nutrient deprivation. There is a hierarchy in the relative contribution of the GC boxes (GC-III > GC-II > GC-I), indicating that their relative importance is not completely redundant. As a minimum, at least one functional GC box is needed for maximal induction of AS transcription by amino acid deprivation. Two of the GC boxes were able to form protein-DNA complexes in vitro with either Sp1 or Sp3. In amino acid-limited cells, the absolute amounts of Sp1 and Sp3 were unchanged, but a portion of the Sp1 protein was phosphorylated. In vivo, when Sp1 was expressed in an Sp-negative background, it increased the basal transcriptional activity of the AS promoter but did not increase the transcriptional rate following amino acid deprivation. In contrast, Sp3 was capable of enhancing both the basal and the starvation-induced activation of the AS promoter. DISCUSSIONMammalian AS is a model for gene regulation by nutrient availability. This report demonstrates that binding of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins plays an important role in both the basal and the metabolite-regulated transcription of the human AS gene. In vivo footprinting had documented constitutive protein binding at three GC-rich sequences within the 5′ upstream region of the human AS gene (5.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although in vivo footprinting is a powerful tool to show binding site occupancy in the intact cell, it does not identify the protein bound. Based on site-directed mutagenesis and transient transfection assays, the present data show that at least one of these three GC-boxes is necessary to maintain high rates of transcription, and all three are required to ensure maximal transcription from the AS promoter. Mutagenesis of these elements individually or in pairs indicated that there is a hierarchy based on their ability to maintain the basal transcription rate as well as to support the induction of transcription by amino acid limitation. GC-III (nt −107 to −97), the one most proximal to the two known nutrient responsive elements NSRE-1 and NSRE-2, is the most effective of all three, followed by GC-II (nt −128 to −119), and then GC-I (nt −148 to −139). When all three GC-boxes were mutated simultaneously, the basal transcription rate was only about 20% of that observed for the wild-type sequence, and although transcriptional activation following amino acid deprivation was still detectable, the absolute rate was nearly half that in the presence of all three GC boxes. When one (Fig. 2) or two (Fig. 3) of the GC boxes were mutated, both basal and nutrient-regulated transcription was affected. In fact, there are two ways to consider the data. First, if the fold-induction relative to the MEM-incubated cells is considered for each mutant, the value is actually greater in some of the mutants than it is for the wild-type sequence, demonstrating that the GC boxes are not absolutely necessary for a nutrient-regulated response to occur. On the other hand, in terms of absolute transcription rates, the numerical value for the reduction of basal transcription was always less than the decrease observed for the stimulated condition, so one would argue that the GC boxes make a positive contribution to the actual transcription rates achieved following amino acid limitation. The question that could be debated is whether the quantitative decrease in the absolute rates of starvation-induced transcription is more important than the difference between the basal and stimulated rates (i.e. the fold-induction). In either case, the mutagenesis results demonstrate that the GC-rich elements serve to establish the degree of responsiveness to nutrient deprivation by modulating the level of regulated transcription mediated by the NSRE-1 and NSRE-2 sequences.The present data also extend previous in vivo footprinting results (5.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by documenting that two of the GC boxes, GC-II and GC-III, form protein-DNA complexes in vitro. This pattern of three primary protein-DNA complexes is consistent with that seen by other investigators using GC-rich sequences as a probe, and the Sp1 (complex-1 and Sp3 (complex-2 and complex-3) composition of these complexes has been documented (17.Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Footprinting of the AS promoter region corresponding to GC-I suggested constitutive protein bindingin vivo (5.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason that GC-I failed to form a complexin vitro is not clear, but it is possible that the protein that binds at the GC-I site might require occupancy at other sites in the promoter as a prerequisite. Sp1 association with complex-1 and Sp3 with complex-2 and complex-3 was the same regardless of whether the radiolabeled probe contained the GC-II or GC-III sequence. These results demonstrate that these two elements are qualitatively similar in their binding specificity, but the mutagenesis data document that they are not identical functionally. The inability of each antibody to supershift the same complex indicates that Sp1 and Sp3 are not components of the same complex. Furthermore, the results for the nuclear extracts from control and histidine-deprived cells were the same with regard to the migration rate of the complexes, the absolute amount of each complex, and the Sp1/Sp3 composition of each complex. These in vitro results are consistent with the in vivo footprinting data indicating that protein binding at these sites was not altered by amino acid availability (5.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The in vivo expression studies illustrate that Sp1 and Sp3 are not functionally equivalent with regard to the ability to modulate nutrient control of AS gene transcription. In vivostudies using Sp-deficient Drosophila SL2 cells demonstrated that expression of either Sp1 or the full-length Sp3 were capable of enhancing basal AS transcription. The electrophoresis mobility shift assay data indicated that both proteins can bind to either GC-II or GC-III, but that they are not simultaneously bound to the same complex at either site. Together these results suggest that the SL2 cell core transcription machinery is capable of recognizing two different complexes, either one containing Sp1 or one containing Sp3, to initiate basal transcription from the AS promoter. However, given that only Sp3, not Sp1, could enhance the starvation-induced transcription in response to amino acid limitation, it appears that the two proteins are not functionally equivalent in their ability to interact (directly or indirectly) with the NSRE-1/NSRE-2 binding proteins. Also, given that the absolute nuclear content of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins in HepG2 cells did not change following histidine deprivation, a change in the ratio of Sp1/Sp3 does not appear to be responsible for regulation of the AS gene, as reported for other genes (27.Discher D.J.

However, the observation that a small, but detectable portion of Sp1 is phosphorylated by amino acid limitation suggests that this posttranslational modification might have a role in Sp1 function under these conditions.Collectively, the results presented in this report document the importance of a series of three GC-rich cis-elements in modulating the transcription driven by the human AS promoter, both the basal and the nutrient-regulated activity. The results also represent the first demonstration that: 1) both Sp1 and Sp3 can bind to these two AS promoter sites, 2) Sp1 and Sp3 do not appear to be part of a common complex, 3) the amount of Sp1 or Sp3 bound does not change in controlversus amino acid-deprived cells, and 4) in vivo, Sp1 and Sp3 are not functionally equivalent in their ability to regulate nutrient control of the human AS gene.

https://openalex.org/W2143932112,"Abstract We have identified and characterized a new amphibian orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and termed it FOR1 (farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-like OrphanReceptor) because it shares the highest amino acid identity with the mammalian FXR. We also identified a variant of FOR1, called FOR2, which has 15 additional C-terminal amino acids. Both variants include an unusual insertion of 33 amino acids in the helix 7 region of the canonical ligand binding domain sequence, suggesting a unique structure for FOR. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that theFOR gene is highly expressed in adult and tadpole liver, kidney, and tail bud stage of the embryo. Detailed expression analysis using in situ hybridization indicates that FOR expression is first detectable at stage 30/31 in the presumptive liver region lasting until stage 41 with a peak level evident at stage 35/36. FOR forms heterodimeric complexes with retinoid X receptor (RXR) as demonstrated by biochemical and mammalian two-hybrid approaches. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrate that FORs form specific DNA-protein complexes on an FXR binding element consisting of an inverted repeat DNA element with 1 nucleotide spacing (IR1) from the phospholipid transfer protein gene promoter. Finally, although FORs do not exhibit constitutive transcriptional activity, frog gallbladder extract significantly augments the transcriptional activities of FORs."

In addition to allosteric regulation by the inhibitor UTP and the activator PRPP, the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase activity is controlled by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation. MAPK phosphorylation, both in vivo and in vitro, increases sensitivity to PRPP and decreases sensitivity to the inhibitor UTP, whereas PKA phosphorylation reduces the response to both allosteric effectors. To elucidate the factors responsible for growth state-dependent regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis, the activity of the de novopyrimidine pathway, the MAPK and PKA activities, the phosphorylation state, and the allosteric regulation of CAD were measured as a function of growth state. As cells entered the exponential growth phase, there was an 8-fold increase in pyrimidine biosynthesis that was accompanied by a 40-fold increase in MAPK activity and a 4-fold increase in CAD threonine phosphorylation. PRPP activation increased to 21-fold, and UTP became a modest activator. These changes were reversed when the cultures approach confluence and growth ceases. Moreover, CAD phosphoserine, a measure of PKA phosphorylation, increased 2-fold in confluent cells. These results are consistent with the activation of CAD by MAPK during periods of rapid growth and its down-regulation in confluent cells associated with decreased MAPK phosphorylation and a concomitant increase in PKA phosphorylation.

The 243-kDa CAD polypeptide (Fig. 1B) is organized (18Mally M.I. Grayson D.R. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6647-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Davidson J.N.

The CPSase activity of CAD is allosterically regulated by the inhibitor UTP and the activator PRPP (13Tatibana M. Ito K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27747-27755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) clearly showed that the allosteric ligands bind to a regulatory subdomain (B3) at the extreme carboxyl end of the CPS.B domain of CAD (Fig. 1B). Carrey and co-workers (26Shaw S.M. Carrey E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Carrey E.A. Campbell D.G. Hardie D.G.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) discovered that purified CAD is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylation does not alter the catalytic activity of CPSase or any of the other CAD activities but results in the loss of sensitivity to the allosteric inhibitor, UTP. There are two PKA phosphorylation sites, one located within the B3 regulatory subdomain and a second in the interdomain linker that connects the ATC and DHO domains (Fig.1B). Desensitization to UTP correlates with the phosphorylation of Ser1406 in the regulatory subdomain. Banerjei and Davidson (30Banerjei L.C. Davidson J.N. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) showed that in transfected cells, replacement of Ser1406 with glutamate mimics the effects ofin vitro phosphorylation of CAD. The phosphorylation of Ser1859 in the interdomain linker has no effect on allosteric regulation but has been implicated in carbamoyl phosphate channeling (31Guy H.I. Evans D.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 370: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). PKA-mediated phosphorylation was considered an activation mechanism that could explain growth-dependent changes in pyrimidine biosynthesis in vivo because the constraints imposed on the pathway by UTP inhibition are effectively abolished. More recently, it was discovered (32Sahay N. Guy H.I. Xin L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that the response to PRPP is also diminished by PKA phosphorylation. The maximum allosteric activation is unchanged, but the affinity of PRPP for CPSase is substantially weakened. Thus, depending on the intracellular concentration of allosteric ligands, PKA-mediated phosphorylation might be expected to either up- or down-regulate the activity of the pathway. Although cAMP is required for the growth of yeast, in most mammalian cells (about 75% of the cases examined), it is considered (33Graves L.M. Lawrence J.C.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 43-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) antagonistic to cell growth and proliferation. Therefore, cAMP may serve in many instances as a counter-regulator to signals generated by insulin and growth factors. Thus, there are likely to be other mechanisms, in addition to PKA phosphorylation, that override the allosteric constraints on CAD activity when cells enter the proliferative phase. Recently, CAD was found (34Graves L.M. Guy H.I. Kozlowski P. Huang M. Lazarowski E. Pope R.M. Collins M.A. Dahlstrand E.N. Earp III, H.S. Evans D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) to be regulated both in vivoand in vitro by the MAPK cascade. MAPKs (35Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar), such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks) 1 and 2, are ubiquitous components of the mitogen-activated cascade that result in cellular proliferation in response to growth factors. Erk1 and Erk2 are also activated by oncogene products (36Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAPK phosphorylates a Thr456 in the A1 subdomain of the CAD CPS (Fig.1B). Although far from the regulatory domain in the linear sequence, molecular modeling 2A. Hewagama, T. Lu, L. Kovari, H. I. Guy, and D. R. Evans, unpublished observations.2A. Hewagama, T. Lu, L. Kovari, H. I. Guy, and D. R. Evans, unpublished observations.based on the known structure of Escherichia coli CPSase (37Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) suggests that it lies in close proximity to the B3 regulatory subdomain. MAPK-mediated phosphorylation, like that of PKA, abolishes UTP inhibition; however, PRPP activation is markedly stimulated. Both the loss of sensitivity to UTP and increased sensitivity to PRPP would be expected to activate CPSase and are thus likely to be important for regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis. These observations suggest that mammalian CPSase is likely to be controlled in vivo by the interplay of allosteric effectors and two different signaling cascades. Here, we show that activation of pyrimidine biosynthesis in rapidly growing cells is associated with phosphorylation by MAPK and that PKA phosphorylation is involved in its down-regulation as cell growth is arrested by contact inhibition. BHK 165-23 (38Wahl G.M. Padgett R.A. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8679-8689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a baby hamster kidney cell line derived from BHK-21 in which the CAD gene was amplified by exposure to the ATCase inhibitorN-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate (PALA). The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 2 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). Two million cells were plated in 75-cm2 flasks containing 25 ml of media. The media were changed every 2 days. The cells were judged to be confluent when nearly all of the attached cells were in contact with one another, and cell growth had ceased. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer, and viability was assessed by trypan blue staining. Although CAD is overexpressed in these cells, the growth-dependent variation in the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis is identical to that observed in other cell types (39Levine E.M. Becker Y. Boone C.W. Eagle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 40Ward G.A. Plagemann P.G.W. J. Cell.

Physiol. 1979; 101: 293-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the elevated levels of protein greatly facilitate quantitation of the phosphorylation state. The rate of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis was measured as described by Huismanet al. (1Huisman W.H. Raivio K.O. Becker M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12595-12602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Fairbanks et al. (42Fairbanks L.D. Carrey E.A. Ruckemann K. Swaminathan R. Kirschbaum B. Simmonds H.A. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1999; 732: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A suspension of cells (0.16–1.6 × 106) in 90 μl of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 without bicarbonate was placed in a 1-ml microfuge tube. A parallel assay mixture was prepared that was identical, except that it contained 1 mm PALA (a gift of Drs. V. Narayanan and L. Kedda of the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment, NIH, Silver Spring, MD), a potent bisubstrate inhibitor of ATCase that completely blocks (43Swyryd E.A. Seaver S.S. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6945-6950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the flux through the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 9.1 mm sodium [14C]bicarbonate (220 μCi/μmol; ICN Inc.). The cell suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min and then pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 1 min in a microfuge. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by the addition of 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid extract was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 1 min. The supernatant was counted, and in some instances, the trichloroacetic acid was removed by back extraction with water-saturated diethyl ether, pH 5.0, for high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. The incorporation of [14C]bicarbonate into RNA and DNA was measured by counting the trichloroacetic acid pellets after dissolving them in 200 μl of 0.1 m NaOH. The progress curves were linear over a 60-min period. The rate of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis was taken as the difference between the rate of bicarbonate incorporation into acid-soluble metabolites in the presence and absence of PALA. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and harvested in 4 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by scraping. Cells were collected, and the flasks were rinsed with 4 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and a lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton supplemented with mammalian protease inhibitor mixture and mammalian phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added (200 μl/3 × 106 cells). The cell suspension was vortexed to dissociate cell clumps, sonicated for 10 s six times in an ice bath, and centrifuged at 24,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatants were collected, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. In some instances, CAD was isolated by affinity chromatography on a PALA column (44Purcarea C. Herve G. Ladjimi M.M. Cunin R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4143-4157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its identity was verified by immunoblotting using CAD-specific antibodies. Protein quantitation was performed by using the method of Lowry et al. (45Lowry O. Rosenbrough N. Farr A. Randall R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphoserine (Z PS-1) and phosphothreonine (Z PT-1) rabbit polyclonal antibodies from Zymed Laboratories Inc. were used for immunoblotting at a dilution of 1:1000 to 1:2000. The rabbit polyclonal CAD serum prepared as described previously (46Grayson D.R. Lee L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15840-15849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used at a 1:5000 dilution. The diphospho-Erks (anti-Thr202/Tyr204 phosphorylated p44/p42) mouse monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution) and the secondary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. SDS-PAGE on 5% or 10% gels was carried out as described by Laemmli (47Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). The samples were heated at 100 °C for 4 min in loading buffer before electrophoresis. The proteins were separated and transferred onto a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturer. The analysis was performed using the ECL reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were visualized using Biomax ML film (Kodak) and quantitated by scanning the immunoblots with a Hewlett Packard ScanJet 4c and UNSCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific Corp.). Care was taken to ensure that all exposures fell within the linear response range of the film. The glutamine-dependent CPSase assay was carried out as described previously (48Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23808-23816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture (1 ml) contained 60 μg of protein, 100 mmTris-Cl, 100 mm KCl, 7.5% Me2SO, 2.5% glycerol, adjusted at pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3.5 mm glutamine, 20.2 mm aspartate, 1.5 mm ATP, 3.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm sodium [14C]bicarbonate (1.6 × 106 μCi/mol). When UTP and/or PRPP were included, the concentration of MgCl2 was adjusted to maintain a 2 mm excess over the sum of the concentration of ATP, UTP, and PRPP. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 15 min, quenched by the addition of 1 ml of 40% trichloroacetic acid, and heated at 100 °C for 15 min. Approximately 0.2 g of dry ice was added to the vials to eliminate the excess CO2 generated during the reaction, and then the vials were heated at 100 °C for an additional 15 min before counting in a Beckman-Coulter counter. The ATCase and DHOase activities were determined using the previously described colorimetric method (49Prescott L.M. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar,50Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The ATCase assay mixture contained 5 mm carbamoyl phosphate and 12 mm aspartate in a buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm KCl, 7.5% Me2SO, 2.5% glycerol, adjusted at pH 8.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The DHOase activity was assayed by monitoring the conversion of 1 mm dihydroorotate to carbamoyl aspartate in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol. The PKA activity in the cell extract (20–150 μg of protein) was determined using the PKA assay kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The assay is based on the phosphorylation of the specific PKA substrate kemptide by [γ-32P]ATP. A second method, the PepTag PKA assay kit (Promega), was also employed. This assay relies on a change in the electrophoretic mobility of a fluorescent kemptide derivative upon phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of the kemptide could also be measured by electrophoresis on a 20% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-phosphoserine antibodies. The relative intensity of the signals was quantitated as described above. The PKA inhibitor H89 was purchased from Sigma. The p44/p42 (Erk1/Erk2) activities were assayed using the assay kit from New England Biolabs following the manufacturer’s protocol. The phosphorylation of the MAPK substrate GST-Elk1 (2 μg) was followed by Western blotting using specific anti-phospho-Elk1 antibodies. Alternatively, Erk1/Erk2 were assayed using phospho-Erk1/Erk2 antibodies that recognize only the activated kinases (Promega). MAPK could be inactivated in vivo by inhibiting MEK with compound PD98059 purchased from Sigma. Growth curves were obtained by seeding BHK 165-23 cells at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/25 ml in 75-cm2 T flasks and monitoring cell number (Fig. 2) over a period of 5–6 days. After an initial lag period, the cells entered an exponential growth phase during which the cell number increased to 17 × 106 over a period of 4 days. As the cells became confluent, there was strong contact inhibition that arrested growth. Thereafter, the cell number began to gradually decline. The rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis was assayed by measuring the time-dependent incorporation of [14C]bicarbonate into nucleotides and pathway intermediates in the presence and absence of 1 mmN-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate, a highly specific bisubstrate ATCase inhibitor that blocks entry into the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. The specific flux through the pyrimidine pathway corresponds to the difference in the rate of total incorporation and the incorporation in the presence of PALA. Typically, pyrimidine biosynthesis corresponds to 60% of the total incorporation. Incorporation proceeded linearly for at least 1 h. In resting cells, the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis was found to be 0.5 pmol/min/106 cells. During exponential growth, the rate increased to 4 pmol/min/106 cells and then dropped precipitously to the basal level when the cells entered the confluent growth phase. Immunoblots using CAD-specific antibodies as well as CAD isolation by affinity chromatography on PALA-Sepharose columns (data not shown) demonstrated that the intracellular concentration of CAD remained constant throughout the growth curve. These results demonstrate that the activity of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway closely mirrors the growth rate of the cells. As described above, the allosteric response of CAD CPSase activity is regulated by phosphorylation of Ser1406 by PKA and phosphorylation of Thr456 by MAPK. Consequently, growth state-dependent CAD phosphorylation was monitored using antibodies directed specifically against phosphoserine and phosphothreonine that could discriminate between these two phosphorylation states. These antibodies have been used to quantitate the phosphorylation of purified CAD by the isolated MAPK and PKA (data not shown). The intensity of the signals on the immunoblots correlated well with the extent of incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into purified CAD catalyzed by the two kinases. Immunoblots of CAD from cells harvested in the early stages of cell growth showed that the level of phosphothreonine was low (Fig.3A) but increased appreciably during exponential growth and then declined abruptly to the basal level when the cells became confluent. Changes in the extent of serine and threonine phosphorylation were quantitated by scanning the immunoblots (Fig. 3B). Whereas CAD threonine phosphorylation increased 2.5-fold during the exponential phase, the level of serine phosphorylation remained low and began to increase only toward the end of the exponential growth phase. Serine phosphorylation reached a maximum increase of 2.5-fold in fully confluent cells and then began to decline. These results are consistent with the interpretation that phosphorylation of CAD by MAPK is highest during exponential growth and declines when growth is arrested, whereas the level of CAD phosphorylation by PKA is low during the exponential growth phase and subsequently peaks when the cells become confluent. The activity of MAPK, measured by the specific phosphorylation of the substrate Elk1, was very low in newly seeded cells and in the early exponential growth phase (Fig. 4) but increased rapidly as the cells began to grow. MAPK activity peaked in the mid-exponential cells and then began to decline as the cells approached confluence. The relative MAPK activity in the mid-exponential growth phase cells was ∼40-fold higher than the values observed in resting or confluent cells. In contrast, the activity of PKA (Fig. 4), assayed by phosphate incorporation into the specific PKA kemptide substrate, increased only slightly during the exponential phase of growth. The alternative assay methods described under “Experimental Procedures” gave comparable results. Thus, whereas MAPK was activated in rapidly growing cells, the activity of PKA did not change appreciably as a function of growth state. The growth-dependent changes in the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis must be a consequence of changes in the activity of CPSase in the cell. CAD was isolated and assayed in vitro in the presence and absence of allosteric effectors to determine how the function of the molecule is altered in different phases of growth. As expected, in the absence of allosteric effectors, the CPSase, ATCase, activities of CAD did not change significantly in the different growth stages (Table I) because the intracellular concentration of the protein remained constant. However, there were progressive changes in the allosteric regulation of the CPSase component as growth proceeded. The extent of activation by 50 μm PRPP increased during exponential growth and then returned to the basal level when cells became confluent. Similarly, 1 mm UTP inhibited CPSase activity in early exponential and, to some extent, confluent cells but was a modest activator in rapidly growing cells.Table ICAD catalytic activities and regulationAssay1-aCPSase activity was assayed at 3.5 mm glutamine, 5.0 mm bicarbonate, and substaturing ATP (1.5 mm) to allow measurement of the allosteric response.

Open table in a new tab A more detailed analysis of CPSase sensitivity to allosteric effectors was obtained by measuring the response of isolated CAD to increasing concentrations of PRPP (Fig. 5). The maximum PRPP activation of CAD from newly seeded cells was 10-fold. However, the extent of activation increased as growth continued, reaching a maximum of 22-fold in mid-exponential cells. As the cells became confluent, there was a gradual decline in PRPP activation of CAD. By day 6, when the cells were fully confluent, the maximum activation of CPSase was only 6-fold. In contrast, the response to UTP was rather small (Table I), so that the predominant growth state-dependent changes in CAD regulation are associated with changes in sensitivity to the allosteric activator, PRPP. The relative insensitivity of CPSase to pyrimidine nucleotides may have important consequences in the cell because increases in the intracellular pool of UTP, such as the 2-fold increase observed in EGF-stimulated cells (34Graves L.M. Guy H.I. Kozlowski P. Huang M. Lazarowski E. Pope R.M. Collins M.A. Dahlstrand E.N. Earp III, H.S. Evans D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), would not appreciably reduce the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis. UTP inhibition and PRPP activation of purified CAD are antagonistic (32Sahay N. Guy H.I. Xin L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 51Jones M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 253-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) in the sense that UTP reduces PRPP activation and vice versa. Similar results were obtained for CAD isolated from mid-exponential cells (Fig.6). However, it is significant that PRPP strongly activated CPSase even in the presence of UTP at concentrations of up to 1 mm, suggesting that the nucleotide cannot effectively counter the increased PRPP activation that develops in rapidly growing cultures. Previous studies (34Graves L.M. Guy H.I. Kozlowski P. Huang M. Lazarowski E. Pope R.M. Collins M.A. Dahlstrand E.N. Earp III, H.S. Evans D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) showed that CAD isolated from EGF-stimulated cells exhibited changes in allosteric regulation that would be expected to promote de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The formation of carbamoyl phosphate by the CPSase domain of CAD is the first committed, rate-limiting step in the pathway. PRPP activation of CPSase was stimulated, and UTP was converted from an inhibitor to a weak allosteric activator in response to EGF. The modulation of these allosteric transitions resulted from the phosphorylation of Thr456 by the MAPK cascade. However, the actual rate of flux through the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway was not measured. Moreover, the changes in CAD phosphorylation state, allosteric regulation, and pyrimidine biosynthesis associated with the arrest of cell growth by contact inhibition are unknown. In this report, we show that the flux through the de novo pyrimidine pathway increases 8-fold when resting cells enter the exponential growth phase and then decreases to basal levels when the cells become confluent and growth ceases. PKA phosphorylates two serine residues of CAD (Ser1406 and Ser1859), whereas MAPK phosphorylates a specific threonine residue (Thr456). Consequently, the phosphorylation state could be measured using specific antibodies directed against phosphothreonine and phosphoserine. We cannot rule out with certainty the participation of additional kinases because the size and complexity of the CAD molecule complicate the direct determination of all phosphorylation sites. 3CAD more than 217 predicted tryptic peptides, and only microgram amounts of the protein can be recovered from cell extracts. However, we are attempting to analyze the complete profile of CAD phosphorylation by LC-mass spectroscopy experiments using the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. We were successful in determining the phosphorylation state of purified CAD, but the analysis required 0.3 mg of the protein. We are now attempting to scale up the isolation of CAD from cells in various growth states.However, we are confident for several reasons that the observed changes in phosphorylation are due, at least in large part, to MAPK and PKA: (a) the maximum CAD threonine phosphorylation was observed in rapidly growing, mid-exponential cells, corresponding to the peak MAPK activity in the cell, (b) the maximum CAD threonine phosphorylation by MAPK occurs when the cells begin to grow exponentially after EGF stimulation (34Graves L.M. Guy H.I. Kozlowski P. Huang M. Lazarowski E. Pope R.M. Collins M.A. Dahlstrand E.N. Earp III, H.S. Evans D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), (c) MEK inhibitor PD98059 and PKA inhibitor H89 partially reversed threonine and serine phosphorylation, respectively (data not shown), (d) the allosteric response to PRPP and UTP of CAD with high threonine phosphorylation was identical to the results obtained after MAPK phosphorylation of CAD both in vivo and in vitro(34Graves L.M. Guy H.I. Kozlowski P. Huang M. Lazarowski E. Pope R.M. Collins M.A. Dahlstrand E.N. Earp III, H.S. Evans D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and (e) when CAD phosphoserine was elevated, the response to PRPP was reduced, a response similar to that observed when CAD is phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. Thus, the growth-dependent changes in the CAD phosphorylation state are likely to be mediated by MAPK and PKA. CAD phosphothreonine increased appreciably during exponential growth and then decreased when the cells became confluent. These changes correlate with the growth-dependent up- and down-regulation of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and with the MAPK activity in the cell. It is interesting that the increase in serine phosphorylation of CAD in confluent cultures was not associated with increased PKA activity but rather with a decrease in the MAPK activity. We have found with purified CAD 4F. D. Sigoillot, D. R. Evans, and H. I. Guy, unpublished results. that prior phosphorylation with MAPK impairs phosphorylation of the protein by PKA. Thus, a plausible explanation of this result is that a decrease in MAPK activity in confluent cells leads to dephosphorylation of Thr456 that now permits phosphorylation of Ser1406 by PKA. We cannot distinguish between PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser1406 and Ser1859; however, because phosphorylation of the latter site has no effect on the allosteric properties of CAD, for the purposes of our working hypothesis we assume that the relevant modification occurs on Ser1406. The observed changes in the allosteric response to UTP and PRPP are similar to the results obtained with EGF-stimulated cells (34Graves L.M. Guy H.I. Kozlowski P. Huang M. Lazarowski E. Pope R.M. Collins M.A. Dahlstrand E.N. Earp III, H.S. Evans D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and with purified CAD upon phosphorylation with MAPK and PKA (28Carrey E.A. Campbell D.G. Hardie D.G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3735-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32Sahay N. Guy H.I. Xin L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In exponentially growing cells, CAD was activated 11-fold by 50 μm PRPP compared with 3.2-fold for cells in the early exponential growth phase (Table I). UTP activated the CPSase from exponentially growing cells by 119% but was an inhibitor of CAD isolated from early exponential cells (38%). When the cells became confluent, PRPP activation decreased; there was only a 2-fold activation by 50 μm PRPP, which is less than the activation observed in early exponential cells, a result consistent with the diminished sensitivity of CPSase to the activator after PKA phosphorylation. UTP, although no longer an activator, did not inhibit the CPSase activity of confluent cells to any great extent (14%), which was as expected because PKA-mediated phosphorylation, like MAPK-mediated phosphorylation, diminishes inhibition by the nucleotide. Therefore, the dominant factor responsible for regulating the CPSase activity in vivo appears to be the response of the enzyme to PRPP. Depending on the intracellular concentration of the effectors, the growth-dependent modulation of the allosteric response could fully account for the observed changes in the rate of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. For example, in the presence of 50 μm PRPP and 1 mm UTP, the CPSase activity from cells harvested in the early exponential growth stage (day 1) was 0.62 nmol/min/mg, compared with a value of 3.78 nmol/min/mg for CAD from exponentially growing cultures (day 4). This 6-fold increase in CAD CPSase activity would be expected to result in a proportional increase in the rate of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, close to the experimentally observed value. Experiments are under way to determine the growth-dependent changes in the intracellular concentration of UTP and PRPP. A model depicting the growth-dependent regulation of CAD CPSase and the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway is shown schematically in Fig. 7. In newly seeded cells, the level of phosphorylation of CAD CPSase is low, as is the flux through the pyrimidine pathway. As the culture progresses to the exponential phase, MAPK is activated, Thr456 of CAD is phosphorylated, and CPSase is activated. This modification leads to an appreciable increase in pyrimidine biosynthesis. Ser1406remains unphosphorylated because CAD-Thr456∼P is a relatively poor substrate for PKA. Once the culture enters the confluent stage, MAPK is deactivated, Thr456 is dephosphorylated by a phosphatase (probably protein phosphatase I), and Ser1406 is phosphorylated by PKA. The combination of phosphorylation of the PKA site and dephosphorylation of the MAPK site leads to a decrease in PRPP sensitivity, lower CPSase activity, and a down-regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis. Many aspects of this model remain to be tested. Nevertheless, it is clear that the CPSase activity of CAD and the flux through the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway are governed by the sequential action of two central signaling cascades.

https://openalex.org/W2042294209,"MalT, the transcriptional activator of the maltose regulon from Escherichia coli, is the prototype of a new family of transcription factors. Its activity is controlled by multiple regulatory signals. ATP and maltotriose (the inducer) are two effectors of the activator that positively control its multimerization, a critical step in promoter binding. In addition, MalK, the ABC component of the maltodextrin transport system, and the two enzymes MalY and Aes down-regulate MalT activity in vivo. By using a biochemical approach, we demonstrate here that (i) Aes controls MalT activity through direct protein-protein interaction, (ii) Aes competes with maltotriose for MalT binding, (iii) ATP and ADP differentially affect the competition between Aes and the inducer, and (iv) part, if not all, of the Aes binding site is located in DT1, the N-terminal domain of the activator, which also contains the ATP binding site. All of these characteristics point toward an identical mode of action for MalY and Aes. However, we have identified an amino acid substitution in MalT that suppresses MalT inhibition by Aes without interfering with its inhibition by MalY, suggesting that the binding sites of the two inhibitory proteins do not coincide. The differential effects of ATP and ADP on the competition between the inducer and Aes (or MalY) suggest that the ATPase activity displayed by MalT plays a role in the negative control of its activity.

MalT, the transcriptional activator of the maltose regulon ofEscherichia coli, is the archetype of a new family of bacterial transcriptional activators of approximately 100 kDa (1.Valdez F. González-Cerón G. Kieser H.M. Servı́n-González L. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2365-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 2.De Schrijver A. De Mot R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It displays distinctive features compared with the other types of regulatory proteins. Transcription activation by MalT involves cooperative binding of the protein to an array of sites located upstream from the −35 region of the target promoters and requires the presence of two positive effectors, maltotriose (the inducer) and ATP (reviewed in Ref. 3.Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that the unliganded form of the protein is monomeric and that the function of both of these effectors is to induce MalT self-association, thought to play a critical role in promoter binding (4.Schreiber V. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MalT is endowed with a weak ATPase activity whose role is thus far elusive; activation of open complex formation does not require ATP hydrolysis (5.Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The activity of MalT is also negatively controlled by three different proteins, MalK, MalY, and Aes. MalK is the ABC component of the maltodextrin transport system (3.Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its role as a phenotypic repressor of the maltose system was recognized with the finding that amalK null mutation renders expression of the regulon constitutive, whereas overexpression of MalK abolishes its induction (6.Hofnung M. Hatfield D. Schwartz M. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 40-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kühnau S. Reyes M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3708-3717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Genetic data suggest that MalK acts as a repressor of MalT when the maltodextrin transport system is resting, thereby preventing induction of the maltose regulon by endogenous maltotriose in the absence of maltodextrins in the growth medium (10.Panagiotidis C.H. Boos W. Shuman H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known regarding the raison d'être of the negative controls exerted by MalY and Aes on MalT. MalY (2 × 43.5 kDa) is a cytoplasmic protein that exhibits βC-S lyase activity (11.Reidl J. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4862-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Zdych E. Peist R. Reidl J. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5035-5039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is co-expressed with MalX, an enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system whose natural substrate is unknown. Induction of the malYgene by a null mutation in malI, the gene encoding the repressor of the malXY operon, abolishes constitutive expression of the maltose regulon in a malK strain and considerably delays induction of the maltose regulon by external maltodextrins in a wild-type strain (13.Ehrmann M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3539-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aes is a cytoplasmic protein displaying esterase activity whose overexpression severely depresses expression of the maltose regulon in a malK strain (14.Peist R. Koch A. Bolek P. Sewitz S. Kolbus T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7679-7686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Kanaya S. Koyanagi T. Kanaya E. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The basal level of expression of the chromosomal aes gene is very low (14.Peist R. Koch A. Bolek P. Sewitz S. Kolbus T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7679-7686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the physiological conditions causing induction of the aes gene as well as the physiological role of the enzyme are not obvious. The mechanism by which MalT activity is negatively controlled is best understood in the case of MalY. In vitro studies have revealed that MalY interferes with transcription activation by MalT by directly interacting with the activator. MalY and maltotriose compete for binding to MalT (16.Schreiber V. Steegborn C. Clausen T. Boos W. Richet E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The available data are consistent with a model in which MalT is in equilibrium between two forms: an inactive, monomeric form stabilized by MalY and an active, monomeric form stabilized by maltotriose and prone to multimerize. In the inactive form, the maltotriose binding site would be either masked or altered so as to show a lower affinity for maltotriose, whereas in the active form, the MalY binding site would be either masked or distorted. As revealed by the x-ray structure of MalY, amino acid substitutions in MalY that impair MalT inhibition delineate a patch on the surface of the protein that most likely represents the MalT contact site (17.Clausen, T., Schlegel, A., Peist, R., Schneider, E., Steegborn, C., Chang, Y., Haase, A., Bourenkov, G. P., Bartunik, H. D., and Boos, W. (1999) EMBO J.Google Scholar). Based on in vivo observations, it was proposed that MalK and Aes also inhibit MalT by antagonizing maltotriose binding (3.Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): overexpression of MalT relieves repression by MalK and Aes (10.Panagiotidis C.H. Boos W. Shuman H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14.Peist R. Koch A. Bolek P. Sewitz S. Kolbus T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7679-7686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and MalTc constitutive mutants that have a higher affinity for maltotriose than wild-type MalT are less sensitive to MalK and Aesin vivo (18.Dardonville B. Raibaud O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1846-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Schlegel, A., Danot, O., Richet, E., Ferenci, T., and Boos, W. (2002) J. Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Panagiotidis et al. (10.Panagiotidis C.H. Boos W. Shuman H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have also provided direct evidence for a physical interaction between MalT and MalK. Structural studies have begun to provide insights into the mechanism by which some of these positive and negative regulatory signals are integrated at the level of the MalT protein. The activator (103 kDa) is made of four structural domains: domain 1 (DT1; residues 1–241), domain 2 (DT2; residues 250–436), domain 3 (DT3; residues 437–806), and domain 4 (DT4; residues 807–901) (20.Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Richet E. Danot O. Raibaud O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24527-24530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DT1 binds ATP and MalY (21.Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33.Schlegel, A., Danot, O., Richet, E., Ferenci, T., and Boos, W. (2002) J. Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar). DT3, whose x-ray structure is known (22.Steegborn C. Danot O. Huber R. Clausen T. Structure. 2001; 9: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), binds maltotriose with a low affinity; high affinity binding is observed only with DT2-DT3 (21.Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DT4, a member of the LuxR-type DNA-binding domain family, contains the DNA binding fold; it is also thought to contact RNA polymerase (23.Danot O. Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Raibaud O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As revealed by limited proteolysis, maltotriose binding triggers a conformational change in MalT that involves domains 1–3 and most likely reflects part of the postulated transition from the inactive form to the active form of MalT (21.Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the three N-terminal domains of the protein represent a new signal integration module (21.Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To obtain a better understanding of how the activity of MalT is negatively modulated, we have analyzed in vitro the mechanism whereby the Aes protein inhibits MalT. We show that Aes alone interferes with transcription activation by MalT in a purified transcription system and that Aes acts via the same mechanism as MalY, although their cognate recognition sites on MalT are likely to be distinct. Strain pop7164, an MC4100 derivative harboring ΔmalT220, a deletion of the entiremalT gene, is described by Schreiber et al. (16.Schreiber V. Steegborn C. Clausen T. Boos W. Richet E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Plasmid pOM2malTp7 T38R was constructed as follows. The mutation leading to the T38R amino acid substitution (codon change ACG→CGC) was introduced in plasmid pOM2malTp7 (24.Danot O. Raibaud O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). After verification of its sequence, the mutagenizedPstI-AatII fragment (509 bp), which contains themalTp7 and T38R mutations, was gel-purified and ligated to the gel-purified AatII-PstI fragment (6616 bp) of plasmid pOM2 (25.Raibaud O. Gutierrez C. Schwartz M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pOM163 was constructed by inserting a blunt-ended Strep tag-encoding linker (sequence of the coding strand, 5′-GCTTGCAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAAA) in the EheI site of the pOM150 plasmid (21.Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and cloning theNcoI-HindIII fragment of the plasmid obtained between the NcoI and HindIII sites of pET28b(+) (Novagen). pOM163 T38R was obtained by amplifying the DT1 T38R-encoding fragment of pOM2malTp7 T38R by PCR using oligonucleotides DT1G and DT1D (21.Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), digesting it with NcoI andAatII, and inserting it between the NcoI andAatII sites of pOM163. The sequences of both constructs were verified. ADP containing <0.2% ATP was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [14C]Maltotriose (850 mCi/mmol) was obtained from America Radiolabeled Chemicals. RNA polymerase holoenzyme (Eς70) was from Epicentre. MalY was provided by T. Clausen (Martinsried, Germany). The protein buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 33 mm tri-potassium citrate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μmpyridoxal-5′-phosphate, and 10% glycerol by filtration through a fast desalting PC 3.2/10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The Aes protein, His-tagged at its N terminus, was purified from strain BRE1162 (26.Bremer E. Silhavy T.J. Weinstock G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1092-1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring plasmid pAS1 (14.Peist R. Koch A. Bolek P. Sewitz S. Kolbus T. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7679-7686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) according to the method of Sewitz (27.Sewitz S. Molekulare Charakterisierung einer Acetylesterase aus Escherichia Coli. Thesis. University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany1998Google Scholar), with some modifications. The bacteria were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of NZA medium (10 g of NZ-amine A (Sheffield Products Inc.), 5 g of yeast extract and 7.5 g NaCl per liter), induced with 1 mmisopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside atA 578 ≈ 0.5, and grown overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 500 mm NaCl) + 20 mm imidazole, and disrupted by two passages through a French press cell. After centrifugation (20 min at 27,000 ×g), the supernatant was treated with DNase I (100 units for 30 min on ice) and loaded on a Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) column (2 ml). The column was washed with buffer A + 20 mm imidazole untilA 280 of the flow-through was close to zero. The protein was eluted with buffer A + 200 mmimidazole and diluted 1:1 with 40% glycerol for stabilization. The protein buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 33 mm tri-potassium citrate, and 10% glycerol by filtration through a fast desalting PC 3.2/10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The extinction coefficient of native His-tagged Aes was determined as described by Lohman et al. (28.Lohman T.M. Chao K. Green J.M. Sage S. Runyon G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10139-10147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by comparing the absorption at 280 nm of the native protein with that of the protein denatured in 6m guanidine-HCl and by assuming that the extinction coefficient of the tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the denatured protein are the same as those ofN-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide and glycyl-l-tyrosyl-glycine, 5690 and 1280m−1 cm−1, respectively (29.Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). A value of ε280, native = 50,030m−1 cm−1 was obtained for Aes, assuming that the protein is monomeric. The protein concentration of the stock Aes solution used to determine the extinction coefficient was also measured with a Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard: a 1 mg/ml Aes solution contains 29 μm Aes. This value was used throughout this work. Wild-type MalT and MalTc26 proteins were purified in the presence of ATP as described by Danot and Raibaud (24.Danot O. Raibaud O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and by Schreiber et al. (16.Schreiber V. Steegborn C. Clausen T. Boos W. Richet E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), respectively. MalT T38R was purified from pop7164 (pOM2malTp7 T38R) as described for wild-type MalT, with some modifications for the chromatography on propyl-agarose; the adsorption, washing, and elution steps were performed in the presence of 0.9, 0.8, and 0.4 m(NH4)2SO4, respectively. ATP-free MalT was prepared, and MalT monomer concentration was determined as described previously (16.Schreiber V. Steegborn C. Clausen T. Boos W. Richet E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ATP-free MalT was used throughout this work. ATP-free MalT was preincubated at 30 °C for 15 min in 18 μl of reaction mixture containing 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 12 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 33 mm tri-potassium citrate, 11 mm magnesium acetate, 0.12 mm EDTA, 1.1 mm dithiothreitol, 220 μg·ml−1 acetylated bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 5 nm malPp DNA fragment, the indicated concentrations of maltotriose and adenine nucleotide, 0.1 μm pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (in the assays with MalY), and Aes or MalY when indicated. RNA polymerase solution (2 μl) (0.54 μm in 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 33 mm tri-potassium citrate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg·ml−1 acetylated bovine serum albumin) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The synthesis of abortive products (ApApC) was initiated by adding 2 μl of a solution containing 5 mm ApA, 0.5 mm [α-32P]CTP (0.3 Ci·mmol−1), and 500 μg·ml−1 heparin (H-0880; Sigma) and allowed to proceed for 15 min at 30 °C (by trapping free RNA polymerase, heparin blocks open complex formation). The reaction products were separated from free [α-32P]CTP by chromatography on Whatman 3MM paper as described by McClure (30.McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The chromatograms were dried and scanned on a PhosphorImager, and the amount of ApApC synthesized was quantified. The malPp DNA used as template is a 320-bp fragment containing the malPp promoter (from −154 to +130), prepared as described previously (16.Schreiber V. Steegborn C. Clausen T. Boos W. Richet E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The 30-μl reaction mixture contained 22 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.7), 22 mm tri-potassium citrate, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 0.07 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 μm [14C]maltotriose (850 mCi·mmol−1), 0.2 mg·ml−1 acetylated bovine serum albumin, and MalT and Aes as indicated. After 5 or 30 min of incubation at 20 °C, the tube was chilled on ice for 2 min, and the proteins were precipitated by adding 180 μl of a solution containing 3.1 m(NH4)2SO4, 40 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 33 mm tri-potassium citrate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm ATP. After 5 min on ice, the precipitate was collected by a 10-min centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, washed with 120 μl of the same solution, dissolved in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA, and counted in 5 ml of liquid scintillation mixture for 5 min. All values represent the average of assays performed in duplicate and are corrected for the background level (40 cpm) measured in the absence of MalT and Aes. The variations observed between two assays did not exceed 25%. MalT (9 μm) and/or Aes (9 μm) were incubated for 20 min at 20 °C in 25 μl of buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.7), 33 mm tri-potassium citrate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP or ADP (or 500 μm AMP-PNP) 1The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNPadenylyl-imidodiphosphate and, when indicated, 1 mm maltotriose. Twenty μl of sample were then injected onto a Superose 12 column (3.2 × 300 mm) or onto a Superdex 200 column (3.2 × 300 mm) (Amersham Biosciences) installed on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with the sample buffer. Filtration was performed at 6 °C at a flow rate of 40 μl·min−1. When needed, 50-μl fractions were collected. The columns were calibrated with globular proteins: bovine thyroglobulin (669 kDa), sweet potato β-amylase (200 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and horse heart cytochromec (12.5 kDa). adenylyl-imidodiphosphate Soluble extracts containing DT1S or DT1S T38R were prepared from 125 ml of LB medium (31.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside (1 mm) was then added, and growth was continued at 24 °C for 4 h. Cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm; pH 7.7) containing 0.5 m KCl, 10% sucrose, and 10 mm MgCl2. The cells were disrupted in a French press (16,000 p.s.i.) and centrifuged (30 min at 180,000 ×g). The supernatant was flash-frozen and kept at −20 °C. Affinity chromatography was performed at 6 °C in Micro Biospin® Bio-Rad columns packed with 50 μl ofStrep-Tactin® Sepharose® resin (IBA). Solutions were passed through the columns by spinning at 11 × g for 1 min in a refrigerated benchtop centrifuge. The columns were equilibrated with cell disruption buffer containing 0.1 mm ATP and loaded with 2 × 50 μl of DT1S soluble extract or 4 × 50 μl of DT1S T38R soluble extract supplemented with 1 mm ATP (after each load, the protein was allowed to bind for 5 min). The columns were washed with 6 × 100 μl (DT1S) or 8 × 100 μl (DT1S T38R) of washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 0.1 mKCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm ATP). Aes (50 μl at 1 mg/ml in washing buffer) or carbonic anhydrase (50 μl at 2 mg/ml in washing buffer) was allowed to flow through the column, and unbound proteins were washed out with 4 × 50 μl of the washing buffer. DT1S or DT1S T38R was then eluted with 4 × 50 μl of the same buffer containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin (Sigma-Aldrich). Nine 50-μl fractions were collected, starting with the input of Aes or carbonic anhydrase, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE (37.5:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide). MalT inhibition by Aes was assessed in vitro by measuring the ability of MalT to activate open complex formation at malPp, a MalT-dependent promoter, in the presence of Aes. MalT was preincubated with malPp in the presence of ATP, maltotriose, and various concentrations of Aes before adding RNA polymerase and allowing open complex formation. The amount of open complexes formed was then quantified by measuring the rate of abortive product synthesis. Given that maltotriose might compete with Aes (3.Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Aes effect was investigated in the presence of various concentrations of inducer. Note that for each combination of ligand concentrations and MalT variant used in this work, we determined the response curve,i.e. the amount of open complexes formed, as a function of MalT concentration. The MalT concentration used to assess the Aes effect was that eliciting about half of the maximum response under the chosen conditions (the inset of Fig. 1 A shows the response curve obtained in the presence of 50 μm ATP and 0.1 mm maltotriose). This ensures that MalT inhibition by Aes, if any, would be detected. As shown in Fig. 1 A, 9 μm Aes strongly depressed open complex formation at malPp in the presence of 0.1 mm maltotriose, whereas no significant inhibitory effect was observed in the presence of 1 mm maltotriose. The observation that MalT inhibition by Aes was relieved in the presence of a high concentration of inducer suggests that the inhibitory effect observed in vitro is functionally relevant. The malT c 26 mutation, which generates the R242P substitution in the DT1-DT2 linker, confers constitutive expression of the maltose regulon by favoring the transition from the inactive state to the active state of MalT (18.Dardonville B. Raibaud O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1846-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Danot O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and it is known to abolish MalT sensitivity to Aes in vivo (33.Schlegel, A., Danot, O., Richet, E., Ferenci, T., and Boos, W. (2002) J. Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar). To confirm that the inhibition caused by Aes in vitro had a functional significance, we tested whether the MalTc26 variant displays a reduced sensitivity to Aes in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1 B, MalTc26 was scarcely inhibited by Aes in the presence of 0.1 mm maltotriose, i.e. a maltotriose concentration allowing repression of wild-type MalT by Aes (Fig. 1 A). This therefore demonstrates that the inhibitory effect observed in vitro reflects the phenomenon of MalT repression by Aes observed in vivo. Furthermore, MalTc26 was inhibited by Aes when assayed in the absence of maltotriose (Fig. 1 B). All these data therefore indicate that MalTc26 is still intrinsically sensitive to Aes and that one effect of malT c 26 is to decrease the concentration of maltotriose required to relieve MalT repression by Aes. Together with the fact that MalTc26 displays a higher affinity for maltotriose (18.Dardonville B. Raibaud O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1846-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this observation further supports the hypothesis of a competition between maltotriose and Aes. To test the hypothesis that MalT inhibition by Aes involves a direct protein-protein interaction, we tried to isolate a MalT-Aes complex by gel filtration. Samples containing MalT and/or Aes were preincubated for 20 min at 20 °C and passed through a Superose 12 column at 6 °C with ATP present throughout the experiment (Fig. 2 A). In the absence of Aes, MalT eluted as a 96-kDa globular protein (elution volume, 1.30 ml), consistent with the fact that MalT is mainly monomeric under these conditions (4.Schreiber V. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Aes alone eluted as a 57-kDa globular protein (elution volume, 1.38 ml). When MalT and Aes, present in a 1:1 (protomer:protomer) ratio, were chromatographed together, a single peak was observed that eluted earlier than MalT, with an apparent molecular mass of 153 kDa (elution volume, 1.23 ml). SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that both proteins were present in the peak fractions (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, Aes and MalT do form a complex. To find out whether maltotriose antagonizes Aes binding to MalT, we performed gel filtration experiments in the presence of both ATP and 1 mm maltotriose, the concentration of inducer relieving inhibition of wild-type MalT by Aes in our transcription system (Fig. 2 C). When chromatographed alone, Aes eluted at the same position as described above, whereas MalT eluted as a >300-kDa protein, consistent with the fact that MalT is multimeric in the presence of ATP and maltotriose (4.Schreiber V. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Filtration of a sample containing both MalT and Aes gave two peaks at the positions at which MalT and Aes, respectively, elute when chromatographed alone. These data clearly demonstrate that maltotriose inhibits interaction between MalT and Aes. In the above-mentioned experiments, complex formation was observed with a sample containing 9 μm MalT and 9.5 μmAes, and no additional peak was observed, thereby suggesting that the MalT:Aes ratio in the inhibition complex is 1:1 (protomer:protomer). This interpretation was confirmed by showing that filtration of samples containing MalT and Aes in a 2:1 or 1:2 ratio (18 μm MalT + 9.5 μm Aes or 9 μm MalT + 19 μm Aes) gave an additional peak at the position at which the protein present in excess is expected to elute (data not shown). Finally, chromatography of samples containing increasing concentrations of both proteins present in a 1:1 (protomer:protomer) ratio showed that the apparent molecular mass of the complex keeps increasing with the concentration of the partners. For instance, chromatography of a sample containing 4.5 μm of each protein through a Superdex 200 column (whose separation range extends up to 600 kDa) gave a unique peak at 1.45 ml (apparent molecular mass, 125 kDa), whereas filtration of a sample containing 36 μm of each protein gave a peak at 1.34 ml (apparent molecular mass, 210 kDa) (data not shown). This suggests that the MalT-Aes complex is actually in rapid equilibrium with dissociated MalT and Aes forms, with the fraction of the complexed proteins increasing with the concentration of the proteins, and the position of the peak reflecting the weighted average Stokes radius of the species in equilibrium.

Previously, we identified an essential role of the coiled-coil domain of Stat3 in binding of the receptor peptides derived from the interleukin-6 receptor subunit, gp130. In this study, we further investigated the molecular basis of this regulation. We found that the C-terminal domain of Stat3 negatively regulates its receptor binding activity only in the absence of the first α-helix of the coiled-coil domain, which leads to a hypothesis of intramolecular interaction. Physical interactions between the coiled-coil domain and the C-terminal domain, as well as the SH2 domain, were indeed detected. Furthermore, a sub-region of the C-terminal domain (amino acids 720–740), which is also involved in the interaction with the coiled-coil domain, was demonstrated to be critical for the regulation of the receptor binding. Correspondingly, phosphorylation on Ser-727 within this region inhibits this interaction. In agreement with the peptide binding results, both the coiled-coil domain and the C-terminal sub-region are necessary for the functional recruitment of Stat3 to the cellular gp130 in response to interleukin-6, suggesting that the interdomain interaction is a prerequisite for the SH2-mediated receptor binding in interleukin-6 signaling.

Seven mammalian STAT genes have been identified so far, and over 40 different polypeptides, including most cytokines and certain growth factors, are known to activate one or more STATs (reviewed in Refs. 1Darnell J.E., Jr. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 2Ihle J.N.

This family comprises IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin, which share receptor gp130 as a common subunit and are able to stimulate Stat3 (7Lütticken C.

Whereas the second membrane-proximal tyrosine residue (Y2) is required for recruitment of the SH2-containing phosphatase-2, any one of the four tyrosine residues (Y3–Y6) containing the consensus Y XXQ motif serves as a docking site for Stat3 binding upon IL-6 stimulation (10Stahl N.

The receptor bound Stat3 is subsequently phosphorylated by Jak1 on a single tyrosine residue 705 at the C terminus. Stat3 forms dimers via the reciprocal interactions between its SH2 domain and the phosphorylated tyrosine 705, translocates into the nucleus, binds to DNA, and regulates the expression of their target genes leading to various cellular responses (3Schindler C.

Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Although the recruitment of Stat3 to gp130 is the first and critical step for its subsequent activation, the regulation of Stat3 receptor binding has been remained largely unknown.STAT proteins share a highly conserved structure with a number of functional domains. The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain (N-domain) of Stat4 contains 130 amino acids was first resolved (16Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell J.E., Jr. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This domain was originally identified to be involved in tetramer formation, but recently also reported to affect the induction of Stat4 tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by IFN-α (17Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 18Murphy T.L. Geissal E.D. Farrar J.D. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7121-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the crystal structures of the DNA bound homodimers of truncated Stat1 and Stat3β, lacking the N-domain and the most of the C-terminal domain, have been reported and exhibit highly similar structures and conserved domains (19Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E., Jr. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 20Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Two new domains have been revealed: an N-terminal coiled-coil domain containing four antiparallel α-helices, and a linker domain located between the DNA binding domain and the SH2 domain. The C-terminal domain comprises the transcriptional activation domain (21Bhattacharya S. Eckner R. Grossman S. Oldread E. Arany Z. D'Andrea A. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and is also involved in the proteasome-dependent turnover in Stat5 (22Wang D.M. Moriggl R. Stravopodis D. Carpino N. Marine J.-C. Teglund S. Feng J. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 392-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the very C-terminal region, including 40–50 amino acids, is absent in both crystal structures (19Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E., Jr. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 20Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The linker domain is reported to be important in the transcriptional activity in Stat1 (23Yang E. Wen Z. Haspel R.L. Zhang J.J. Darnell J.E., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5106-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas the coiled-coil structure has often been inferred to be involved in protein-protein interaction (24Kammerer R.A. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed, Lys-161 in the helix α1 of Stat1 interacts with p48, a protein from an IFN response factor family, to form interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 complex that regulates IFN-α-responsive genes (25Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A short region in the first α-helix of Stat3 has been demonstrated to associate with another transcription factor, c-Jun, which cooperatively activates transcription of IL-6 inducible α2-macroglobulin gene (26Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, the coiled-coil domain of Stat5 associates with Nmi, an N-Myc interactor, which augments Stat5-mediated transcription (27Zhu M. John S. Berg M. Leonard W. Cell. 1999; 96: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, the possible effect of the coiled-coil domain on the activation of Stat protein itself has not been studied. Recently, we have reported that removal of the first α-helix, or mutation of the highly conserved Asp-170 or Lys-177 residue, in the first α-helix of the coiled-coil domain of Stat3 results in a loss of the SH2 domain-mediated binding of gp130 (28Zhang T. Kee W.H. Seow K.T. Fung W. Cao X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7132-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The data demonstrated a novel role of the coiled-coil domain of Stat3 in the regulation of its receptor binding and the subsequent activation in response to IL-6 and epidermal growth factor. Based on the crystal structure of the Stat3 dimer, the coiled-coil and SH2 domains are separated by the DNA binding and linker domains (19Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E., Jr. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 20Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the coiled-coil domain is able to remotely influence the SH2 function through an undetermined mechanism.In the present study, experiments were performed to investigate the molecular basis of this novel regulation. We have identified that deletion of the first α-helix in the coiled-coil domain abrogates its binding activity. However, further removal of 70 amino acids (700–770) at the C terminus of this mutant restores the impaired binding activity, suggesting a possible interaction of the coiled-coil domain and the C-terminal domain. Such interaction is indeed observed. Furthermore, a sub-region of C-terminal domain was demonstrated to be critical for regulation of the receptor binding and is also essential for the interaction with the coiled-coil domain. Experimental results support the proposed model of the domain-domain interaction and indicate its physiological relevance in the functional recruitment of Stat3 to the gp130 receptor subunit in IL-6 signaling.

Although the recruitment of Stat3 to gp130 is the first and critical step for its subsequent activation, the regulation of Stat3 receptor binding has been remained largely unknown. signal transducers and activators of transcription amino acid(s) Janus kinase Src homology 2 N-terminal domain interferon interleukin phosphate-buffered saline extracellular signal-regulated kinase glutathione S-transferase signal transducers and activators of transcription amino acid(s) Janus kinase Src homology 2 N-terminal domain interferon interleukin phosphate-buffered saline extracellular signal-regulated kinase glutathione S-transferase STAT proteins share a highly conserved structure with a number of functional domains. The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain (N-domain) of Stat4 contains 130 amino acids was first resolved (16Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell J.E., Jr. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This domain was originally identified to be involved in tetramer formation, but recently also reported to affect the induction of Stat4 tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by IFN-α (17Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 18Murphy T.L. Geissal E.D. Farrar J.D. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7121-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the crystal structures of the DNA bound homodimers of truncated Stat1 and Stat3β, lacking the N-domain and the most of the C-terminal domain, have been reported and exhibit highly similar structures and conserved domains (19Chen X.

Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Two new domains have been revealed: an N-terminal coiled-coil domain containing four antiparallel α-helices, and a linker domain located between the DNA binding domain and the SH2 domain. The C-terminal domain comprises the transcriptional activation domain (21Bhattacharya S. Eckner R. Grossman S. Oldread E. Arany Z. D'Andrea A. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and is also involved in the proteasome-dependent turnover in Stat5 (22Wang D.M. Moriggl R. Stravopodis D. Carpino N. Marine J.-C. Teglund S. Feng J. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 392-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the very C-terminal region, including 40–50 amino acids, is absent in both crystal structures (19Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E., Jr. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 20Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The linker domain is reported to be important in the transcriptional activity in Stat1 (23Yang E. Wen Z. Haspel R.L. Zhang J.J. Darnell J.E., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5106-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas the coiled-coil structure has often been inferred to be involved in protein-protein interaction (24Kammerer R.A. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed, Lys-161 in the helix α1 of Stat1 interacts with p48, a protein from an IFN response factor family, to form interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 complex that regulates IFN-α-responsive genes (25Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A short region in the first α-helix of Stat3 has been demonstrated to associate with another transcription factor, c-Jun, which cooperatively activates transcription of IL-6 inducible α2-macroglobulin gene (26Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, the coiled-coil domain of Stat5 associates with Nmi, an N-Myc interactor, which augments Stat5-mediated transcription (27Zhu M. John S. Berg M. Leonard W. Cell. 1999; 96: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, the possible effect of the coiled-coil domain on the activation of Stat protein itself has not been studied. Recently, we have reported that removal of the first α-helix, or mutation of the highly conserved Asp-170 or Lys-177 residue, in the first α-helix of the coiled-coil domain of Stat3 results in a loss of the SH2 domain-mediated binding of gp130 (28Zhang T. Kee W.H. Seow K.T. Fung W. Cao X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7132-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The data demonstrated a novel role of the coiled-coil domain of Stat3 in the regulation of its receptor binding and the subsequent activation in response to IL-6 and epidermal growth factor. Based on the crystal structure of the Stat3 dimer, the coiled-coil and SH2 domains are separated by the DNA binding and linker domains (19Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E., Jr. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 20Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the coiled-coil domain is able to remotely influence the SH2 function through an undetermined mechanism. In the present study, experiments were performed to investigate the molecular basis of this novel regulation. We have identified that deletion of the first α-helix in the coiled-coil domain abrogates its binding activity. However, further removal of 70 amino acids (700–770) at the C terminus of this mutant restores the impaired binding activity, suggesting a possible interaction of the coiled-coil domain and the C-terminal domain. Such interaction is indeed observed. Furthermore, a sub-region of C-terminal domain was demonstrated to be critical for regulation of the receptor binding and is also essential for the interaction with the coiled-coil domain. Experimental results support the proposed model of the domain-domain interaction and indicate its physiological relevance in the functional recruitment of Stat3 to the gp130 receptor subunit in IL-6 signaling.

From the sequence stems P1 and P2 can vary from 4 to 8 and from 6 to 10 base pairs, respectively, with folding of a long P1 stem being in competition with folding of a long P2 stem. Shorter substrates, which cannot compete with the formation of an extended P2, result in faster cleavage, suggesting that binding of the substrate indeed interferes with folding of stem P2. In vivo splicing analyses of mutants containing alterations in stems P1 and P2 indicate that the wild-type exon sequence of P1 is suboptimal for splicing. Furthermore, folding of P1 in vivo is in competition with an alternative cryptic P1 stem resulting in mis-splicing. Translation promotes splicing at the correct 5′ splice site, whereas in the absence of translation, mis-splicing is favored. The combination of the in vitro and in vivo assays clearly displays the folding problems for correct splice site selection in this group I intron.

For example, the exon 1 structure of the Tetrahymena rRNA intron affects folding of the 5′ splice site, reducing misfolding and thereby facilitating splicing (5Woodson S.A. Emerick V.L. Mol. Cell.

We have shown that in vivo splicing of this intron requires translation (23Semrad K. Schroeder R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and that inhibition of translation results in splicing deficiency and in increased mis-splicing due to alternative base pairing of the IGS, resulting in a so-called cryptic P1 stem (24Chandry P.S. Belfort M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Waldsich C. Semrad K. Schroeder R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To gain a better understanding of td intron folding and substrate binding, basic kinetic parameters were established for the first step of splicing in a trans-cleaving ribozyme. A reaction overview is given in Equation 1. E+S+G⇌E·S·G⇌E·P1·GP2⇌E+P1+GP2Equation 1 For simplicity the ribozyme td WT-12 is called ribozyme or E, the oligonucleotide substrate WT-S is referred to as substrate or S, and the guanosine cofactor is termed G. The resulting products after the cleavage reaction are referred to as P1 for the 5′ product (corresponding to exon1) and GP2, the 3′ product (corresponding to the intron) to which the cofactor is added. Kinetic analysis of the trans cleavage reaction revealed that the off-rate of the substrate is faster than the cleavage step. One possible explanation for this poor binding might be a competition between substrate binding and the formation of an extended P2 stem. This prompted us to analyze substrate binding using shorter substrates in vitro and to introduce mutations in stems P1 and P2 in vivo to better understand the folding of the td intron at the 5′ splice site in its natural context. The ribozyme was transcribed in vitro from PCR products amplified from plasmid tdΔP6-2 (26Schroeder R. von Ahsen U. Belfort M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3295-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with the following primers: the coding primer with the TD T7-7 (5′-CCA AGT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GCC TGA GTA TAA GGT GA-3′, VBC-Genomics, Austria) containing the T7 promoter and the intron sequence, starting 7 nucleotides downstream of the 5′ splice site, whereas the antisense primer TD 3′ end-5 (5′-TGT TCA GAT AAG GTC GTT AAT C-3′, VBC-Genomics) ended 5 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ splice site. The in vitro transcription reaction mixture contained 2.5 μg of purified PCR product, 5 mm each NTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 150 units of T7 RNA polymerase in 100 μl of a solution of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 26 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm spermidine. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the DNA template was digested with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. The RNA was precipitated and purified on a 5% polyacrylamide (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 7 m urea gel. After UV shadowing the correct band was cut out of the gel. To elute the RNA the gel slice was soaked in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS overnight at 4 °C. The purified ribozyme was then precipitated and dissolved in H2O and quantitated spectrophotometrically. The extinction coefficient for the ribozyme is 2.56 × 106 liter/mol·cm (as determined from paris.chem.yale.edu/extinct.html). The sequences of the oligonucleotide substrates are as follows: WT-S, 5′-UUGGGUUAAU-3′; WT-S −1 nt, 5′-UGGGUUAAU-3′; WT-S −2 nt, 5′-GGGUUAAU-3′; WT-S −3 nt, 5′-GGUUAAU-3′; WT-P, 5′-UUGGGU-3′; TDS4, 5′-UCAGGUUCCAAA-3′; chase, 5′-UCACCCCCAU-3′ (Eurogentec, Belgium). In a typical labeling reaction 20 pmol of oligonucleotide substrates were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase as described previously (27Zaug A.J. Grosshans C.A. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8924-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The labeled substrates were purified on a 20% polyacrylamide gel as described for the RNA transcription. All reactions were single turnover, with ribozyme,td WT-12, in excess of 5′-end-labeled substrate (S*, ∼0.1 nm). The ribozyme was prefolded in 50 mm NaMOPS, pH 7.0, and 10 mmMgCl2 at 50 °C for 10 min and then shifted to 25 °C for 5 min. The reaction at 25 °C was then started with the addition of S* and 1 mm guanosine in 50 mmNaMOPS, pH 7.0, buffer and 10 mm MgCl2. Usually six aliquots (dependent on the kinetics of the reaction) of 2 μl were removed from 20 μl reactions at specified times and quenched by the addition of ∼2 volumes of 20 mm EDTA in 90% formamide with 0.005% xylene cyanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 1 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Substrates and products were separated by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. The ratios of products to substrates were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and the software ImageQuant. Reactions were usually followed for ∼3 half-lives. The disappearance of substrate was first order, and end points of ∼97% were typically obtained in nonlinear least squares fits (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). 2 μl of 1.5× ribozyme (4 μm final concentration to be well above the KD and ensure substrate binding) were prefolded as described above in the presence of MgCl2 and NaMOPS, pH 7.0. After shifting to 25 °C, 1 μl of labeled substrate was added. After an incubation of 1 min, 27 μl of unlabeled chase (in 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaMOPS, pH 7.0, and 1 mm guanosine) was added in a 200-fold excess to the ribozyme. Aliquots were taken after various time points to analyze the cleavage reaction in the presence of the chase. In a control the chase was omitted from the experiment to test whether the reaction goes to completion. For the binding assays the ribozyme was prefolded as described above. After the addition of the labeled substrate (∼0.5 nmS* in 10 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm NaMOPS, pH 7.0) the reaction was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. After this incubation time the samples were mixed with 30% glycerol and loaded immediately on a 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel running at 5 W for 1 h. The electrophoresis buffer contained 66 mm Hepes, 34 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA at a pH 7.5. The separated bands were quantified on a PhosphorImager. Binding was analyzed using the program PrismGraph (GraphPad Software) to obtain KD values for substrate binding. All the td constructs are in the context of the vector pTZ18U-tdΔP6-2 (28Salvo J.L. Coetzee T. Belfort M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mutants were generated by in vitro mutagenesis (29Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) using the following mutagenic oligonucleotides (MWG-Biotech AG, Germany) with the mutagenic residues underlined: P1 stabilizing (P1 stab), 5′-GGC CTC AAT TAA CCT GAG AAA ACA TCT ACT GAG CG-3′; P1 destabilizing (P1 de), 5′-GGC CTC AAT TAA CCG TGG AAA ACA TCT ACT GAG CG-3′; P2 stabilizing (P2 stab), 5′-CCC CGT TTA GAT AGA TTATGA GTA TAA GTC ACC TTA TAC TCA GGC C-3′; P2 destabilizing (P2 de), 5′-CCC CGT TTA GAT AGA TTA GTG GTA TAA GTC ACC TTA TAC TCA GGC C-3′; P2 compensatory (P2 comp), 5′-CCC CGT TTA GAT AGA TTAGTG GTA TAA GTC ACC TTA TAC CAC GGC CTC AAT TAA CCC AAG AAA ACA TCT ACT GAG CG-3′; ΔP1/ΔP2: 5′-CCC CGT TTA GAT AGA TTA CAA GTA TAA GTC ACC TTA TAC CAC GGC CTC AAT TAA CCC-3′. The construct plasmids were linearized with EcoRV (New England Biolabs) and in vitro transcribed at non-splicing conditions in the presence of [α-32P]GTP as described previously (30von Ahsen U. Davies J. Schroeder R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For the splicing reaction 500–1000 cpm/μl of labeled RNA was incubated for 1 min at 90 °C. After the addition of splicing buffer (final concentration, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.4 mm spermidine, 5 mm MgCl2) the RNA was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Before the addition of guanosine (final concentration of 500 μm) a zero control was taken. After the guanosine cofactor addition, various time points were taken, and splicing was stopped in 1× volume of loading buffer (1× TBE, 7m urea, 0.005% xylene cyanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). The splice products were separated on 5% polyacrylamide (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 7 m urea gel. The Escherichia coli strain and growth media used in this study, the in vivo RNA isolation, and poisoned primer reaction was performed as described previously (31Clodi E. Semrad K. Schroeder R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3776-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Quantification was done with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, and average values where calculated from three different RNA preparations. To analyze the first step of splicing, the td intron (Fig. 1A) was converted into a trans-cleaving ribozyme. It was shortened by the first 7 nucleotides at the 5′-end of the intron and by 5 nucleotides at the 3′ end (Fig. 1B). The resulting RNA (named td WT-12) lacks the exons with the according SS. The substrate WT-S (Fig. 1B) used for the trans assays contains the 5′ SS flanked by the last 6 nucleotides of the 5′ exon and the first 4 nucleotides of the intron. To verify that the ribozyme td WT-12 cleaves the substrate WT-S at a single position that correlates with the natural 5′ splice site, a cleavage experiment was performed. The 32P-labeled substrate was cleaved in the presence of 400 nm ribozyme and saturating amounts of guanosine cofactor in a time-dependent manner. The product band was then compared with a labeled oligonucleotide that was designed to represent the predicted product obtained after correct 5′ SS cleavage. In addition, a partial digest with P1 endonuclease was performed to verify the length of the product. The P1 endonuclease cleavage leads to formation of a 3′-OH terminus, which is also expected for ribozyme cleavage. The td WT-12 ribozyme cleaves the WT-S substrate at the correct position, and aberrant cleavage products were not observed (data not shown). It is expected that the dissociation constant (KD) for the substrate is a function of Watson-Crick pairings and additional long range interactions. Other factors that can affect this value include alternative interactions of the IGS that must be broken before duplex formation and steric constraints within the ribozyme (32Russell R. Herschlag D. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To get a first estimate of KD for WT-S, the Gibbs free energy for helix formation between the substrate and the ribozyme IGS was calculated as described previously (33Serra M.J. Turner D.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 242-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The Gibbs free energy at 25 °C (ΔG 250) is −9.3 kcal/mol. Given that ΔG 250 = RT ln KD, the calculated KD is 140 nm for binding of WT-S substrate (see Table I).Table IEffects of various substrates on P1 formation tested on two ribozymesRibozymeSubstrateCalculated KDMeasured KDCalculated/Measuredkobsmin−1tdWT-12WT-S140 nm530 nm (SK)0.260.16520 nm (EB)0.27WT-S −1 nt2.16 μm98 nm (SK)220.43WT-S −2 nt14 μm167 nm (SK)840.6WT-S −3 nt266 μm562 nm (SK)4731.6TDS4120 pm49 nm (EB)0.02BiphasictdU33CWT-S140 nm160 nm (EB)0.90.08SK, saturation kinetics; EB, equilibrium binding;kobs (min−1), measured with 1000 nm ribozyme (above the KD for all substrates) and saturating guanosine factor concentration. Open table in a new tab SK, saturation kinetics; EB, equilibrium binding;kobs (min−1), measured with 1000 nm ribozyme (above the KD for all substrates) and saturating guanosine factor concentration. By using single turnover reactions at varying ribozyme concentrations and saturating guanosine, the apparent dissociation constant of substrate WT-S to the ribozyme was determined. The conversion of the substrate to the product followed pseudo-first-order kinetics (Fig. 1C) and was measured for at least three half-lives. Plots of the observed rate constants (kobs) against ribozyme concentrations revealed saturation behavior with K1/2 of 530 nm (Fig. 2A). Because the measured K1/2 value for the substrate WT-S was higher than expected from calculation, the dissociation constant was also measured with a second method, equilibrium binding. For that, the substrate was added to the prefolded ribozyme and equilibrated for 30 min and then loaded onto a non-denaturing 8% acrylamide gel. Complex formation in the absence of guanosine cofactor gave a KD of 520 nm(Fig. 2C). This value agrees well with the K1/2 measured using saturation kinetics, suggesting that the kinetic value represents an equilibrium constant. Both dissociation constants show a weaker binding of WT-S to the IGS of the ribozyme than expected from the calculated value. For the Tetrahymena ribozyme the measured KD is 1 nm, which is much lower than the calculated value and is explained by additional tertiary interactions that assist docking of the substrate into the ribozyme core (Ref. 16Narlikar G.J. Khosla M. Usman N. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2465-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and references cited therein). One possible explanation for the weak substrate binding of the td ribozyme is that P1 is not docked into the catalytic core and that steric restrictions hinder efficient P1 formation. The catalytic capability of the ribozyme was determined by the second-order rate constant (kcat/Km)S for the reaction of free ribozyme to substrate WT-S in single-turnover experiments with increasing [E] at saturating guanosine concentration. The value of kobs increases linearly with the concentration of ribozyme (2.5–200 nm[E]). The rate of the reaction of free td ribozyme with the substrate (kcat/Km)WT-S is 2.7 × 105m−1min−1, which is 100-fold slower than the equivalent reaction rate for the Tetrahymena ribozyme (12Herschlag D. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10159-10171Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). A chase experiment was performed to establish the partitioning of the ternary complex [E·S*·G] (Scheme FS1). The complex can either react (kchem), resulting in product formation, or the labeled substrate (S*) can dissociate (koff). To ensure that after S* has fallen off, it cannot rebind to the ribozyme, the ternary complex is chased with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled substrate (S). This complex [E·S·G] might also react and form products, but these cannot be detected since they are not labeled. The data show that no cleavage of S* takes place upon the addition of the unlabeled chase substrate. This suggests that the off-rate of the substrate is faster than the cleavage step (Fig. 2B). One possible explanation for the weak binding of the substrate and the relatively slow reaction rates might be that bases A14, G13, and U12 of the IGS bind to bases U33, U34, and G35 of J2/3, forming an extended P2 stem (Fig. 3A), thereby preventing binding or displacing the substrate. This interaction would compete with substrate WT-S binding and would explain the weak binding and the fast off-rate. To test this possibility, the substrate was shortened by 1–3 nucleotides (WT-S −1nt, WT-S −2 nt, WT-S −3 nt), and the proposed interaction of A14 with U33 was disrupted in a mutated ribozyme (td U33C), which prevents the formation of the extended P2 stem (Fig. 3A, right). Table I shows the results for the different substrates and the mutated ribozyme tested with the WT-S substrate. Shortening of the substrates did not only result in tighter binding than predicted from base pairing (see Table I, WT-S −3 nt is binding ∼470 times stronger to the IGS than calculated) but also increases the rate of cleavage by an order of magnitude (see Fig. 3B). The second order rate constant (kcat/Km)S for the reaction of the free ribozyme with substrate WT-S −3 nt is 2.9 × 106m−1 min−1, which is 10-fold faster than for the WT-S substrate (data not shown). Chase experiments with gradually shorter substrates showed that the off-rates get slower according to the substrate length and that the cleavage steps also get gradually faster than the off-rates (data not shown). We also tested a substrate that can in principle form more Watson-Crick base pairs upon formation of P1 than the WT-S. Using substrate TDS-4 (5′-UCAGGUUCCAAA-3′), 2 G·U pairs were changed to an AU and a GC pair. Substrate TDS-4 has a calculated KD of 120 pm, but the KD as measured with equilibrium binding was 49 nm (data not shown). Again, this weak binding (∼400-fold measured/calculated) suggests that substrate binding is hindered in some way. The cleavage reaction of TDS-4 with the ribozyme td WT-12 shows a biphasic behavior, with 60% of the substrate cleaved in an initial fast burst (1.6 min−1), which is identical to the rate observed for the short substrate WT-S −3 nt (data not shown). The fact that shorter substrates improve the reaction rate and that stabilization of P1 with the substrate TDS-4 results in a biphasic behavior suggests that binding of the longer substrates is sterically not favored. P2 might be longer than previously proposed (2Michel F. Westhof E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 585-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). To test whether the interaction between IGS and J2/3 affects docking, a mutation was introduced that blocks the pairing of U33 with A14 (td U33C; Fig. 3A). Equilibrium binding of substrate WT-S to the mutated ribozyme gave a KD of 160 nm, approximately the calculated value. In this mutant the formation of the extended P2 is blocked, and the calculated value now correlates with the measured value (Table I). Because the cleavage of the substrate WT-S was so inefficient in vitro, we analyzed whether the WT sequence of P1 is also suboptimal for splicing in vivo. Because the substrate WT-S used in the in vitro assay represents the exact sequence of exon I and the first nucleotides of the intron, the question arises as to what fold the RNA acquires for in vivo splicing, a long P1 stem or an extended P2 helix. To test the in vivo splicing efficiency of mutants with different P1 and P2 stem lengths, various constructs stabilizing or destabilizing the two helices were made (Fig. 4A). First, the upstream exon sequences proposed to pair with the IGS forming P1 were mutated so that P1 was either destabilized (P1 de) or stabilized (P1 stab). Then mutations were introduced into the J2/3 region in such a way that P2 could no longer form the proposed extended helix (P2 de) or that formation of the extended helix was favored (P2 stab). A mutation in the internal guide sequence disrupts both P1 and P2 stems (ΔP1/ΔP2). P2 was also reinforced in mutant P2, compensatory (P2 comp) with the difference to P2 stab that in this mutant formation of extended P1 was not possible. To determine in vivo splicing of the different mutants imbedded in the full-length exon context, total RNA was isolated from E. coli cells transformed with the different constructs. The RNA was then tested using reverse transcription as described previously (31Clodi E. Semrad K. Schroeder R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3776-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The WT td intron (WT), a translation-deficient mutant (SH-1), a splice-deficient mutant (td C870U), and the mutant variants with different P1 and P2 stems were tested for in vivo splicing. Fig. 5 and Table II show the results of these in vivo splicing experiments. The WT intron construct splices with 57% efficiency for the mRNA. In addition 2–5% aberrant splicing takes place at a cryptic splice site, which is located 29 nucleotides upstream of the correct 5′ SS (24Chandry P.S. Belfort M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Table IIIn vivo splicing efficiency of various constructs stabilizing or destabilizing P1 and P2MutantP1 formationP2 formationSplicingTotal splicing%WT+++57 ± 5.5P1 stabilizing++++64 ± 4.8P1 destabilizing−+++71 ± 2.4P2 stabilizing++++/−10 ± 4.7P2 destabilizing+−−3.4 ± 0.4P2 compensatory−++−3.0 ± 1.5ΔP1/ΔP2−−+/−11 ± 2.4The percentage of total splicing represents the data of at least three independent RNA preparations shown with S.D. Open table in a new tab The percentage of total splicing represents the data of at least three independent RNA preparations shown with S.D. In agreement with the higher activities of the short substrates in vitro, the mutant with a destabilized P1 (P1 de, Fig. 5B, lane 5) splices to a higher percentage (72%) than the WT construct (57%). Also stabilization of P1 (P1 stab) results in slightly higher splicing activity in vivo, in agreement with the in vitro data obtained with the TDS-4 substrate (Fig. 5B, lane 4). P1 is more stable in this mutant and might fold more efficiently. Reinforcing P1 improves the KD of the substrate without abolishing the possibility of folding an extended P2. The two mutants, P1 stab and P1 de, are both more active in splicing than the WT, suggesting that the WT P1 sequence is suboptimal for splicing. The mutants in which the extended formation of P2 was hindered (P2 de and ΔP1/ΔP2) resulted in a strong reduction of splicing activity, where the effect was stronger when P1 was able to form, 3% splicing versus 12% splicing (P2 de, Fig. 5B, lane 7, and Table II). Disrupting P1 and P2 simultaneously (ΔP1/ΔP2, Fig. 5B, lanes 9) results in a weaker phenotype than disrupting P2 alone. Stabilization of P2 (P2 stab and P2 comp) is also not tolerated. Again, the effect is stronger when P1 cannot be formed (3% splicing), as seen for mutant P2 comp (Fig. 5B, lane 8) and less dramatic when P1 can form (10% splicing) as seen for mutant P2 stab (Fig. 5B,lane 6). These results suggest that a balance is required between stems P1 and P2, where formation of an extended P2 might be coupled to docking of P1 into the core (Table II). To obtain information on the first step of splicing, which is not separately detectable from the second step in our in vivo assay, we performed in vitro cis-splicing reactions with the full-length WT and mutant constructs. In agreement with the in vivo data splicing of mutants, P1 stab and P1 de show more efficient splicing than the WT. Similarly, mutations in P2 stab and ΔP1/ΔP2 splice moderately, and P2 de and P2 comp are splicing-deficient (Fig. 4B). A cryptic splice site results from an alternative folding of the IGS with sequences upstream in exon 1 forming an alternative stem P1 (Fig. 6A). This cryptic P1 stem cannot compete with the formation of an elongated P2 stem. In contrast to splicing at the 5′ splice site, splicing at this cryptic splice site is not dependent on translation. As has been shown previously, inhibition of translation by the antibiotic neomycin B results in accumulation of cryptic splice product and inhibition of splicing at the 5′ splice site (25Waldsich C. Semrad K. Schroeder R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). In a condition where the pre-mRNA is not translated due to a stop codon upstream in exon 1, cryptic splicing is enhanced, whereas correct splicing is severely reduced. When splicing in stop codon mutants is rescued in vivo by coexpressing StpA, a protein with RNA chaperone activity, the ratio of cryptic splicing to correct splicing is almost 1:1 (31Clodi E. Semrad K. Schroeder R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3776-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the absence of translation the equilibrium between cryptic P1 and P1 is shifted in favor of cryptic P1, which cannot compete with the formation of an extended P2. We therefore suggest that the ribosome might unfold the cryptic P1 stem and also favor an extended P2. An in vitro trans-cleaving ribozyme for the td intron was constructed to study folding of the 5′ splice site-containing P1 stem. In contrast to the Tetrahymena intron, which is inserted into the highly structured large ribosomal subunit RNA, the td intron disrupts the coding region of the thymidylate synthase gene, which is mainly unstructured. When group I introns transpose into novel sites, folding of the splice sites has to adapt to the new sequence and structure context. Our results point to a suboptimal sequence of stems P1 and P2 for efficient splicing. We propose that an extended P2 stem with 10 base pairs favors docking of P1 to the ribozyme since the shorter substrates, which allow formation of extended P2, resulted in a tighter binding than calculated for Watson-Crick base pairing. This is not seen when formation of extended P2 is not possible. In the absence of an extended P2, P1 cannot be efficiently docked into the catalytic center and becomes rate-limiting. The cleavage rate of the ribozyme mutant U33C with substrate WT-S is only 2-fold slower than the wild type with the same substrate. This suggests that formation of an extended P2 is not essential but that it contributes to docking and improves the cleavage rate (Table I). P2 might stabilize P1 by stacking. In the current model by Michel and Westhof (2Michel F. Westhof E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 585-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) this stacking is distorted with a shift of about half or one base pair. From the wild-type sequence of P1, in which length can vary from 4–8 base pairs, P2 can vary from 6 to 10 base pairs, and J2/3 can vary from 3 to 7 nucleotides. The length of J2/3 is 4 bases in the current model, but a refined model would allow a length of only 3 bases, 2L. Jaeger, personal communication. as proposed by the model with the td ribozyme and the shortest substrate, WT-S −3 nt. An important question is the role of J2/3. Is it only a linker, or is the junction involved in three-dimensional interactions? It had previously been shown that deletion of the P2 stem is not tolerated but can be bypassed by shortening the P1 stem to 5 base pairs and J2/3 to 3 nucleotides (UAA) (28Salvo J.L. Coetzee T. Belfort M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This suggests that J2/3 is not involved in essential tertiary interactions but is needed to set the distance to P3. The td intron can be split by disrupting J2/3 and by providing a substrate in trans consisting of helices P1 and P2 (34Costa M. Michel F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3289-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Phage T4 carrying the td intron proliferates in prokaryotic cells, where transcription, splicing, and translation are coupled events. Formation of stem P1 might be part of a regulatory process required to orchestrate translation and splicing. It has been demonstrated that translation is essential for efficient splicing to occur in vivo (23Semrad K. Schroeder R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand translation of pre-mRNA with termination at the 5′ splice site must be prevented to inhibit the formation of a truncated amino-terminal portion of the thymidylate synthase protein. The sequence of the extended P1 stem represents a rare leucine codon, which has five alternative codons. The question is raised as to why the exon sequence did not evolve to improve splicing. One possibility is that regulation of splicing by translation is beneficiary to impede overproduction of thymidylate synthase. This question remains to be analyzed. We are currently studying the regulation of translation of the td gene. Preliminary results point to a down-regulation of translation of the pre-mRNA compared with the mRNA. 3K. Semrad and R. Schroeder, unpublished results. In the absence of translation, splicing is not only inefficient but also aberrant, since folding of an alternative P1 stem is favored, leading to the formation of a cryptic splice site. This alternative P1 stem does not compete with the formation of the extended P2 stem. The ribosome might unfold the cryptic P1 stem and also favor an extended P2. These results point to a more complex regulation of splicing by the ribosome. Translation and splicing of the td gene are coupled. We do not yet know whether the regulation of splicing and translation are bi-directional processes where splicing is regulated by translation and vice versa. In this study we looked only at splicing events without taking into account that translation might also be regulated by the structure of the pre-mRNA. To fully understand the role of the cryptic P1 stem as well as the overlapping P1 and P2 sequences, we need to study the translation activity and the interrelation between translation and splicing.

https://openalex.org/W2079085209,"It is well established that G protein-coupled receptors stimulate nitric oxide-sensitive soluble guanylyl cyclase by increasing intracellular Ca2+ and activating Ca2+-dependent nitric-oxide synthases. In pituitary cells receptors that stimulated adenylyl cyclase, growth hormone-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing factor, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone also stimulated calcium signaling and increased cGMP levels, whereas receptors that inhibited adenylyl cyclase, endothelin-A, and dopamine-2 also inhibited spontaneous calcium transients and decreased cGMP levels. However, receptor-controlled up- and down-regulation of cyclic nucleotide accumulation was not blocked by abolition of Ca2+signaling, suggesting that cAMP production affects cGMP accumulation.

Stimulation of sGC is especially well established for GPCRs that signal through phospholipase C- and adenylyl cyclase (AC)-dependent pathways. It is generally accepted that calcium mediates the coupling of these receptors to sGC (1.Christopoulos A. El-Fakahany E.E. Life Sci. 1999; 65: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Activation of the phospholipase C signaling pathway leads to inositol trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ mobilization accompanied by facilitation of voltage-sensitive and/or -insensitive Ca2+influx (2.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar), whereas activation of the AC signaling pathway usually facilitates Ca2+ influx without affecting Ca2+mobilization (3.Stojilkovic S.S. Tomic M. Koshimizu T. Van Goor F. Conn P.M. Means A.R. Principles of Molecular Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 149-185Google Scholar). Both cAMP and protein kinase A stimulate voltage-gated Ca2+ influx, the former through activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (4.Zagotta W.N. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and the latter by activating nonselective cationic channels (5.Takano K. Takei T. Teramoto A. Yamashita N. Am. J.

The rise in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) induced by these receptors is sufficient to stimulate two nitric-oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) enzymes, endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS) (7.Xu X.

Because sGC is activated by NO, either as an intracellular or plasma membrane permeable agonist (8.Lucas K.A. Pitary G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schultz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A.

The activity of these enzymes was confirmed by measurements of NO, NO2, and NO3 under different experimental paradigms (16.Ohita K. Hirata Y. Imai T. Marumo F. J.

These findings support a generally accepted view about the relevance of calcium in activation of the NOS/sGC signaling pathway by GPCRs. Recent studies have also indicated that high [Ca2+]i inhibits cGMP accumulation, an action presumably mediated by direct inhibitory effects of [Ca2+]i on sGC activity (24.Andric S.A. Kostic T.S.

Here we addressed the hypothesis that cAMP, in addition to [Ca2+]i, mediates the action of GPCRs on sGC-controlled cGMP production. Experiments were done in cultured pituitary cells and immortalized GH3 cells. We focused investigations on two receptors signaling through a Gs pathway, GHRH and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors; two receptors signaling through a Gq/G11 pathway, TRH receptor (that also couples to a Gs signaling pathway) (26.Allgeier A.

GHRH receptors are expressed in somatotrophs and immortalized GH3 pituitary cells (30.Bluet-Pajot M.-T. Epelbaum J. Gourdji D. Hammond C. Kordon C. Cell. Mol.

Experiments were performed on anterior pituitary cells from normal female Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) and immortalized GH3 cells. Pituitary cells were dispersed as described previously (36.Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Wong A.O.L. Zivadinovic D. Stojilkovic S.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4091-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in medium 199 containing Earle's salts, sodium bicarbonate, 10% horse serum, and antibiotics. GH3 cells were cultured in F12K nutrient mixture containing 1.5 g/liter NaHCO3, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 15% horse serum. Cells were stimulated by GHRH, CRF, TRH (from Bachem, Torrance, CA), forskolin, and 8-Br-cAMP (from RBI, Natick, MA). Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) were inhibited by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), dipyridamole, and zaprinast from Sigma-RBI. Two compounds, 4H-8-bromo-1,2,4-oxadiazolo(3,4-d)benz(b)(1,4)oxazin-1-one (NS 2028) from Sigma-RBI and 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) from Sigma were used to inhibit sGC. Cells (1 × 106per well) were plated in 24-well plates in serum-containing M199 and incubated overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2/air and saturated humidity. Experiments were done in cells 16 h after dispersion. Prior to the experiments, medium was removed, and cells were washed with serum-free M199 and stimulated at 37 °C under 5% CO2/air and saturated humidity. Cells were stimulated with GHRH, CRF, and TRH in serum-free medium and in the absence or presence of PDE inhibitors. At the end of the incubation period cells were dialyzed in an IBMX-containing medium, and cyclic nucleotide concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay in medium and in dialyzed cells as previously described (24.Andric S.A. Kostic T.S. Tomic M. Koshimizu T. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 844-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using specific antisera provided by Albert Baukal, (NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For [Ca2+]i measurements, cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer supplemented with 2 μmfura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) at 37 °C for 60 min. Coverslips with cells were washed with this buffer and mounted on the stage of an Axiovert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) attached to the Attofluor Digital Fluorescence Microscopy System (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD). Cells were examined under a ×40 oil immersion objective during exposure to alternating 340 and 380 nm light beams, and the intensity of light emission at 520 nm was measured. The ratio of light intensities, F340/F380, which reflects changes in Ca2+ concentration, was followed in several single cells simultaneously. cAMP and cGMP data are shown as total (cell content + medium) nucleotide levels. The results shown are means ± S.E. from sextuplicate determination in one of at least three similar experiments. Asterisks indicate a significant difference among means, estimated by Student's t test. In a mixed population of pituitary cells bathed in medium containing no PDE inhibitors, basal cGMP was about 1–2 pmol/well (Fig. 1 A, right panel). Addition of 1 mm IBMX, a nonselective inhibitor of PDEs, increased cGMP levels to about 10 pmol/well (Fig. 1 B,right panel) suggesting that PDEs participate in the control of basal cGMP levels in pituitary cells. As shown in Fig. 1 C, right panel, no further increase in cGMP levels was observed in cells bathed in medium containing 1 mm IBMX together with two cGMP-specific PDE inhibitors, dipyridamole (50 μm) and zaprinast (50 μm). Basal cAMP levels also increased in cells bathed in 1 mmIBMX-containing medium (Fig. 1, A versus B, left panels), whereas the addition of all three PDE inhibitors did not further elevate cAMP levels (Fig. 1 C, left panel). These results suggest that 1 mm IBMX is sufficient to silence PDEs in anterior pituitary cells. GHRH, CRF, and TRH induced significant elevations in cGMP levels comparable to basal levels. As shown in Fig. 1, right panels, all three agonists stimulated cGMP accumulation when PDEs were not silenced (A), but also in cells bathed in IBMX-containing medium (B), and medium containing a mixture of three inhibitors (C). Agonist-induced cGMP accumulation was also observed in cells treated with 50 μm zaprinast and 50 μm dipyridamole alone (Table I). GHRH-induced cGMP accumulation was observed in cells bathed in medium containing 10 μmvinpocetine, a specific PDE1 inhibitor (basal, 3.44 ± 0.04; 1 nm GHRH-treated, 5.04 ± 0.235 pmol/well;p < 0.05). GHRH, CRF, and TRH also induced a significant and PDE-independent increase in cAMP accumulation (Fig. 1,left panels and Table I). These data indicate that an agonist-induced rise in cGMP levels does not result from modulation of PDE activity but represents de novo cGMP production.Table IEffects of dipyridamole (50 μm) and zaprinast (50 μm) on agonist (100 nm)-induced cyclic nucleotide accumulation in anterior pituitary cells during a 60-min incubationAgonistsDipyridamoleZaprinastcAMPcGMPcAMPcGMPpmol/wellBasal3.28 ± 0.163.62 ± 0.380.98 ± 0.173.51 ± 0.49TRH8.28 ± 0.841-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.4.46 ± 0.131-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.2.18 ± 0.291-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.5.74 ± 0.051-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.CRF24.59 ± 3.961-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.6.23 ± 0.341-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.16.37 ± 2.841-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.6.73 ± 0.311-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.GHRH157 ± 6.491-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.8.36 ± 0.221-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.97.89 ± 4.291-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.8.63 ± 0.411-ap < 0.05 vs. basal.1-a p < 0.05 vs. basal. Open table in a new tab To identify which guanylyl cyclase, particulate or soluble, is responsible for agonist-induced cGMP production, cells were incubated in the presence of ODQ and NS 2028, two inhibitors of sGC (37.Garthwaite J. Southam E. Boulton C.L. Nielsen E.B. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 184-188PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Olesen S.-P. Drejer J. Axelsson O. Moldt P. Bang L. Nielsen-Kudsk J.E. Busse R. Mulsch A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, left panel, ODQ significantly inhibited basal and GHRH-induced cGMP production in two doses, 0.1 μm and 1 μm, in cells bathed in medium without PDE inhibitors. NS 2028 also inhibited basal and GHRH-induced cGMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner with an estimated EC50 of about 100 nm when cells were bathed in 1 mm IBMX-containing medium (Fig. 2 B, left panel). None of these inhibitors affected basal and GHRH-induced cAMP production (right panels). NS 2028 also inhibited CRF and TRH-induced cGMP production when added in 1 μmconcentration (not shown). These results indicate that basal and agonist-induced cGMP production in pituitary cells is mediated by sGC. GHRH and CRF increased [Ca2+]i in cells bathed in 2 mm Ca2+-containing medium (Fig. 3, A and B,left traces) but not in 10 μmCa2+-containing medium (right traces), indicating that [Ca2+]i transients induced by these agonists were dependent on Ca2+ influx. TRH-induced Ca2+ response (Fig. 3 C, left trace) was not abolished by depletion of extracellular Ca2+ (not shown). However, when cells were bathed in Ca2+-deficient medium in the presence of 1 μmthapsigargin for 30 min prior to addition of TRH, no response in [Ca2+]i was observed (right trace) indicating that the Ca2+-signaling action of this agonist was abolished when the intracellular Ca2+ pool was depleted. In cells bathed in Ca2+-deficient medium, GHRH and CRF induced a significant increase in cGMP accumulation (Fig. 3,D and E, right panels). TRH was also able to stimulate cGMP production when bathed in Ca2+-deficient and thapsigargin-containing medium (Fig. 3 F, right panel). Agonist-induced cAMP accumulation was also not blocked by abolition of the Ca2+-signaling function of these receptors (Fig. 3, D–F, left panel). These results indicate that all three GPCRs can stimulate cGMP production and cAMP production in a [Ca2+]i-independent manner. When stimulated with 100 nm agonist concentrations, the amplitudes of cGMP responses were highest in GHRH-stimulated cells followed by CRF and TRH. The same order was observed in cells bathed in Ca2+-containing medium with and without PDE inhibitors (Fig. 1) and in cells bathed in Ca2+-deficient medium (Fig. 3). In all experimental conditions cGMP production paralleled cAMP production raising the possibility that cAMP, in addition to [Ca2+]i, mediates the action of these receptors on cGMP production. To further compare cAMP and cGMP production, cells bathed in 1 mm IBMX-containing medium were stimulated with increasing concentrations of GHRH, CRF, and TRH, and both nucleotides were measured from the same samples. Fig. 4 A illustrates the concentration-dependent effects of these agonists on cAMP production (left panel) and cGMP production (right panel). In all concentrations tested the Ca2+-mobilizing TRH was less potent stimulating cGMP production and cAMP production compared with CRF and GHRH. Correlation analysis of these data combined revealed the existence of a significant linear relationship between cAMP and cGMP production (Fig. 4 B). Further experiments were done with GH3-immortalized cells expressing both GHRH and TRH receptors. As in pituitary cultured cells, GHRH and TRH stimulated cAMP and cGMP production in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4 C). There was also a parallel in cAMP and cGMP accumulation, as illustrated by linear regression in Fig. 4 D, derived from these two experiments. In contrast to primary culture, in GH3 cells GHRH- and TRH-induced cAMP and cGMP responses were almost comparable, suggesting that the cross-coupling of TRH receptors to Gsis more effective in these cells than in pituitary cells. Dissociation between Ca2+signaling and cGMP production and parallelism between cAMP and cGMP production suggest that coupling of GHRH, CRF, and TRH receptors to the Gs signaling pathway accounts for their actions on cGMP production. To test this hypothesis more directly, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml CTX, an activator of Gs, for variable times. During a 2-h incubation in the presence of 1 mm IBMX this treatment significantly increased cAMP production (Fig. 5 A, left panel) as well as cGMP production (Fig. 5 A, right panel). As in agonist-stimulated cells (Fig. 4), there was a linear relationship between cAMP and cGMP levels in untreated (Fig. 5 B, left panel) and CTX-treated cells (right panel). In cells treated with CTX for 12 h and 24 h without IBMX, then washed, and incubated for an additional 60 min in the presence of 1 mm IBMX, cAMP production was several fold higher than in controls (Fig. 5 C, left panel). In these cells cGMP production was also significantly elevated (right panel). The addition of 1 μmforskolin, an AC activator (Fig. 5 D, left panel), and 8-Br-cAMP, a permeable cAMP analog, also induced the time-dependent rise in cGMP production in cells bathed in 1 mm IBMX-contained medium (Fig. 5 D, right panel). Thus, the nonreceptor-mediated activation of the Gs-AC signaling pathway also leads to stimulation of sGC activity. To test the specificity of AC-dependent signaling in GPCR-controlled cGMP production, in further experiments we stimulated cells with ET-1, an agonist for ETA receptors and apomorphine, a specific agonist for D2 receptors. Both agonists abolished spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients in pituitary cells (Fig. 6, A andB). ET-1, but not apomorphine, also stimulated Ca2+ mobilization resulting in a rapid and transient [Ca2+]i response. In accord with literature data (27.Tomic M. Zivadinovic D. Van Goor F. Yuan D. Koshimizu T. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7721-7731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Missale C. Nash R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar), ET-1 and apomorphine inhibited cAMP production in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6 C), and this inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in cGMP production (Fig. 6 D). Consistent with the role of Ca2+ mobilization in activation of NOS/sGC (7.Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Lau K.S. Gukovskaya A.C. Brown R.J. Pandol S.J. Muallem S. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), inhibition of cGMP production was less prominent in ET-1 than apomorphine-stimulated cells. To test the hypothesis that protein kinase A mediates the action of cAMP on stimulation of sGC activity, cells were treated with 1 μm H89, a concentration that predominantly inhibits protein kinase A. Addition of H89 for 15 min prior to stimulation with agonists resulted in a significant reduction of receptor-induced cGMP production (Fig. 7 A). Forskolin and CTX-induced cGMP production was also reduced in the presence of 1 μm H89 (Fig. 7 B). On the other hand, cAMP levels measured in the same samples were not affected by H89 (Table II).Table IIcAMP levels in anterior pituitary cells treated with agonists (100 nm) for 60 min in 1 mm IBMX-containing medium in the absence and presence of 1 μm H89Agonists (100 nm)−H89+H89pmol/wellGHRH65.45 ± 1.3263.83 ± 2.81CRF54.55 ± 1.4559.18 ± 0.73TRH13.55 ± 0.8513.66 ± 0.29 Open table in a new tab It is generally accepted that GPCRs stimulate NO-sensitive sGC by increasing [Ca2+]i and activating Ca2+-dependent nNOS and/or eNOS (1.Christopoulos A. El-Fakahany E.E. Life Sci. 1999; 65: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18.Kostic T.S. Andric S.A. Stojilkovic S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In accordance with this hypothesis, earlier studies have indicated that sGC is expressed in pituitary cells as well as nNOS and eNOS, and that spontaneous electrical activity and calcium signaling provide an effective mechanism for activation of NOS and subsequent stimulation of sGC (18.Kostic T.S. Andric S.A. Stojilkovic S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24.Andric S.A. Kostic T.S. Tomic M. Koshimizu T. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 844-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we extended these investigations by studying the actions of several GPCRs on cGMP production. The focus in investigations was on receptors that stimulate and inhibit spontaneous, voltage-gated calcium influx-dependent [Ca2+]i transients, as well as on receptors that facilitate calcium release from intracellular Ca2+ pools. In cultured pituitary cells, ETA and D2receptors inhibited spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients and decreased cGMP production, whereas GHRH, CRF, and TRH elevated [Ca2+]i and stimulated cGMP production. Both ETA and D2 receptors signal through Gi/o pathways leading to inhibition of AC and stimulation of inward rectifier potassium current that hyperpolarizes cells, terminates spontaneous firing of action potentials, and abolishes voltage-gated Ca2+ influx (27.Tomic M. Zivadinovic D. Van Goor F. Yuan D. Koshimizu T. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7721-7731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Missale C. Nash R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GHRH and CRF receptors stimulate AC activity through Gs (30.Bluet-Pajot M.-T. Epelbaum J. Gourdji D. Hammond C. Kordon C. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 31.Abou-Samra A.-B. Harwood J.P. Manganiello V.C. Catt K.J. Aguilera G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Somatotrophs respond to GHRH with a robust increase in cAMP production and stimulation of nonselective cationic channels, presumably through protein kinase A, depolarization of cells, and facilitation of voltage-gated Ca2+ influx (5.Takano K. Takei T. Teramoto A. Yamashita N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E1014-E1057Google Scholar, 6.Naumov A.P. Herrington J. Hille B.

Physiol. 1997; 499: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CRF receptors also increase excitability of corticotrophs and facilitate voltage-gated calcium influx (43.Guerineau N. Corcuff J.-B. Tabarin A. Mollard P. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 44.Kuryshev Y.A. Childs G.V. Ritchie A.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Finally, TRH receptor is a member of the Gq/11-coupled calcium-mobilizing receptors whose activation leads to inositol trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release followed by facilitated calcium influx (32.Hinkle P.M. Nelson E.J. Ashworth R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This receptor is also cross-coupled to the Gs-AC signaling pathway (26.Allgeier A. Offermanns V.S.J. Spicher K. Schultz G. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13733-13735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein kinases A and C pathways may play an important role in controlling the sustained voltage-gated Ca2+ influx by inhibiting spontaneously active inward-rectified potassium channels (3.Stojilkovic S.S. Tomic M. Koshimizu T. Van Goor F. Conn P.M. Means A.R. Principles of Molecular Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 149-185Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+signaling by these receptors is consistent with the [Ca2+]i dependence of sGC-derived cGMP production. Several lines of evidence presented here, however, indicate that Ca2+ is not an exclusive signaling pathway for stimulation of cGMP production by GPCRs. GHRH and CRF were found to stimulate sGC in cells bathed in Ca2+-deficient medium, a treatment that abolished agonist-induced Ca2+ influx. The Ca2+-mobilizing action of TRH, but not the agonist-induced cGMP accumulation, was abolished in cells with intracellular Ca2+ pools depleted by thapsigargin. In contrast to [Ca2+]i signals, cGMP production was found to correlate well with cAMP levels, suggesting that GPCRs stimulate the NOS/sGC signaling pathway through the cAMP-dependent mechanism. A decrease in cGMP production observed in cells stimulated with ET-1 and apomorphine also paralleled a decrease in cAMP production. The dependence of cGMP accumulation on cAMP levels was further documented in experiments with CTX, a treatment that elevated the levels of both nucleotides. To directly activate AC, we treated cells with forskolin. Furthermore, to exclude AC-independent actions of forskolin, cells were treated with 8-Br-cAMP, a permeable cAMP analog. In both experiments, a significant increase in cGMP production was observed confirming a hypothesis that cAMP mediates the action of GHRH, CRF, and TRH on cGMP production. Finally, receptor-, CTX-, and forskolin-induced stimulation of cGMP production, but not cAMP production, was reduced in the presence of H89. These results indicate that GPCRs can modulate sGC activity through the AC signaling pathway. The dependence of sGC activity on the protein kinase A signaling pathway is consistent with several reports indicating that phosphorylation of eNOS makes this enzyme active in the absence of [Ca2+]i signaling. The serine/threonine protein kinase Ark/PKB-induced phosphorylation of eNOS is well established (45.Fulton D. Gratton J.-P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Wlsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 65-70Crossref Scopus (2232) Google Scholar, 46.Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fissithaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar). One report also suggests that eNOS from endothelial cells is activated and becomes calcium independent upon phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (47.Butt E. Bernhardt M. Smolenski A. Kotsonis P. Frohlich L.G. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Lohmann S.M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5179-5187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have also indicated that protein kinase C and protein kinase A can phosphorylate sGC in vitro, leading to the facilitation of enzyme activity (48.Zwiller J. Revel M.O. Malvia A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1350-1353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Zwiller J. Revel M.O. Basse P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 1383-1387Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In intact PC12 cells, phorbol ester-activated protein kinase C also phosphorylates sGC and increases the enzyme activity (50.Louis J.C. Revel M.O. Zwiller J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1177: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). At the present time, our experiments cannot distinguish between the possible direct actions of protein kinase A on sGC from that mediated by NOS. However, it is unlikely that phosphorylation of eNOS accounts for GHRH-induced cGMP production in somatotrophs because these cells do not express eNOS, but do express nNOS (18.Kostic T.S. Andric S.A. Stojilkovic S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of which leads to a decrease in NO production (51.Bredt D.S. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A calcium-independent increase in cGMP levels observed in agonist-stimulated cells is also compatible with findings that this ion plays an important role in the control of PDE1 activity in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of PDEs by protein kinases A and G also modulates the activity of these enzymes (52.Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar, 53.Conti M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1317-1327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Feil R. Hofmann F. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 271: 3310-3317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, calcium depletion/repletion in culture media in our experiments could influence the rate of cGMP degradation. However, that does not provide a rationale for agonist-induced cGMP accumulation, because it was also observed in cells bathed in medium containing 1 mm IBMX, an inhibitor that blocks PDE1 with an IC50 of 4 μm, as well as PDEs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11, with IC50 values of 2–100 μm(52.Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced cGMP accumulation was also observed in cells bathed in the presence of vinpocetine, a specific PDE1 inhibitor, as well as in the presence of specific inhibitors of cGMP-dependent PDEs, dipyridamole, and zaprinast (52.Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). The ability of GHRH, CRF, and TRH to stimulate cGMP accumulation in cells bathed in medium containing a mixture of three PDE inhibitors in high concentrations further argues against the hypothesis that protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of PDEs, specifically PDE1A, accounts for down-regulation of their activities and elevation in cGMP levels. In conclusion, here we show that GHRH, CRF, and TRH receptors in pituitary cells stimulate sGC activity and that this stimulation also occurs when Ca2+ signaling is abolished. The experiments argue against the action of these receptors on PDE activity and support the hypothesis that de novo cGMP production accounts for a Ca2+-independent increase in cGMP levels. Our results further indicate that the coupling of GHRH and CRF receptors and cross-coupling of the TRH receptor to the Gs signaling pathway represents the main mechanism for stimulation of sGC, whereas the coupling of receptors to the Gi/o signaling pathway leads to inhibition of cGMP production. The results also indicate that Gs-mediated activation of AC and subsequently protein kinase A is required for stimulation of sGC activity. Thus, in addition to [Ca2+]i, up- and down-regulation of AC activity by GPCRs provides an effective mechanism for control of cGMP production."
https://openalex.org/W2008065064,"Maize ferredoxin-NADP+reductase (FNR) consists of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and NADP+ binding domains with a FAD molecule bound noncovalently in the cleft between these domains. The structural changes of FNR induced by dissociation of FAD have been characterized by a combination of optical and biochemical methods. The CD spectrum of the FAD-depleted FNR (apo-FNR) suggested that removal of FAD from holo-FNR produced an intermediate conformational state with partially disrupted secondary and tertiary structures. Small angle x-ray scattering indicated that apo-FNR assumes a conformation that is less globular in comparison with holo-FNR but is not completely chain-like. Interestingly, the replacement of tyrosine 95 responsible for FAD binding with alanine resulted in a molecular form similar to apo-protein of the wild-type enzyme. Both apo- and Y95A-FNR species bound to Cibacron Blue affinity resin, indicating the presence of a native-like conformation for the NADP+ binding domain. On the other hand, no evidence was found for the existence of folded conformations in the FAD binding domains of these proteins. These results suggested that FAD-depleted FNR assumes a partially folded structure with a residual NADP+ binding domain but a disordered FAD binding domain.

Protein folding is one of the most important issues in structural biology and many other related fields in molecular biology and biotechnology. The characterization of an intermediate state between the native and unfolded structures is important in understanding the folding mechanism of proteins (1.Fink A.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 495-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 2.Arai M. Kuwajima K. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 53: 209-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Although many small proteins of <100 amino acids in length show highly cooperative folding reactions from the unfolded to the native state without accumulating observable intermediates, proteins with >100 amino acid residues (3.Jackson S. Folding Des. 1998; 3: R81-R91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) and some smaller proteins (4.Ferguson N. Capaldi A.P. James R. Kleanthous C. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5.Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. Freeman, New York2000: 543-553Google Scholar) show populated intermediates with partially folded structures, e.g. the molten globule state, in the first millisecond of folding reactions (6.Roder H. Colon W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For a number of proteins, partially folded intermediates with conformational properties similar to those of kinetic folding intermediates have been found under mild denaturing conditions in equilibrium (7.Chamberlain A.K. Handel T.M. Marqusee S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 8.Zitzewitz J.A. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10205-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These observations offer the opportunity to analyze the detailed conformational properties of the partially folded structures or the roles of individual subdomains. Some large proteins can be decomposed into folding units (9.Fischer K.F. Marqusee S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 701-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10.Peng Z.U. Wu L.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 53: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The existence of several domains in such proteins is assumed to reflect both the organization of the genes and the dynamics of the folding process (11.Hopfner K.P. Kopetzki E. Kresse G.B. Bode W. Huber R. Engh R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9813-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12.Lang D. Thoma R. Henn-Sax M. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. Science. 2000; 289: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that domains and subdomains fold independently and subsequently merge to produce the native molecule (13.Vallon O. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 38: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent studies of protein folding have focused on small proteins or domains of larger proteins. This is not only because of the simplicity of the mechanisms and reversibility of folding reactions, but also because of the probability that these reactions reflect earlier events in the folding process of larger proteins. On the other hand, the direct characterization of folding and unfolding behavior with the entire molecule is necessary for complete understanding of the folding mechanisms of larger proteins (5.Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. Freeman, New York2000: 543-553Google Scholar, 14.Baker D. Nature. 2000; 405: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) 1The abbreviations used are: FNRferredoxin-NADP+ reductaseGdm-HClguanidinium hydrochlorideSAXSsmall angle X-ray scatteringFADflavin adenine dinucleotide1The abbreviations used are: FNRferredoxin-NADP+ reductaseGdm-HClguanidinium hydrochlorideSAXSsmall angle X-ray scatteringFADflavin adenine dinucleotide (EC 1.18.1.2) as an example of such a large protein. ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase guanidinium hydrochloride small angle X-ray scattering flavin adenine dinucleotide ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase guanidinium hydrochloride small angle X-ray scattering flavin adenine dinucleotide FNR catalyzes reduction of NADP+ to NADPH during photosynthesis in higher plants (15.Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of maize FNR has recently been determined by x-ray crystallography (Fig. 1) (16.Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimita-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The molecule was shown to be composed of well-defined FAD and NADP+ binding domains. The FAD binding domain (residues 1–153) is made up of a scaffold of six antiparallel β-strands arranged in two perpendicular β-sheets, the bottom of which is capped by an α-helix and a long loop. The NADP+ binding domain (residues 154–314) consists of a core of five parallel β-strands surrounded by seven α-helices. The FAD cofactor is bound to the protein through hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, and π-π stacking interactions. The isoalloxazine ring system, which constitutes the reactive part of FAD, is stacked on the aromatic rings of two tyrosine residues, i.e.Tyr95 and Tyr314 (Fig. 1 A). We studied the structural properties of holo-FNR and two forms of apoenzyme, i.e. apo-FNR prepared by CaCl2 treatment (17.Zanetti G. Cidaria D. Curti B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the Y95A mutant lacking FAD due to the absence of one of the stacking aromatic rings. The structure and stability of these species were analyzed by a combination of optical and physicochemical techniques including CD, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and fluorescence spectrometry, pH and guanidinium hydrochloride (Gdm-HCl) denaturation, affinity chromatography, and enzymatic assay. The data suggested the formation of intermediate structures with a persistent native-like NADP+ binding domain and an unfolded FAD binding domain. Recombinant maize leaf FNR (18.Onda Y. Matsumura T. Kimita-Ariga Y. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and ferredoxin (19.Matsumura T. Sakakibara H. Nakano R. Kimata Y. Sugiyama T. Hase T. Plant. Physiol. 1997; 114: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were prepared using an Escherichia coliexpression system. Site-directed mutagenesis to obtain Y95A-FNR was carried out by PCR with a pair of primers (sense, 5′-GGCGTCGACAAGAACGGCAAGCCGCACAAGGTCAGGCTCGCTTCCATCGCCAGCAGCGCG-3′ (underlined letters indicate the codon for the substituted Ala); antisense, 5′-CATCGATACCCTTCTCCATGCCTTTCAACCC-3) using pYOL-FNR1 (18.Onda Y. Matsumura T. Kimita-Ariga Y. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) as the template. PCR was carried out with a program of 25 cycles of 30 s at 98 °C and 45 s at 72 °C using KOD polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The resulting fragment was cut with SalI and inserted into the corresponding region of pYOL-FNR1 (18.Onda Y. Matsumura T. Kimita-Ariga Y. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The achievement of the desired mutation and the absence of PCR errors were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of Y95A-FNR, which was not associated with FAD, was carried out essentially according to the method used for the wild-type FNR except for Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography. Crude extract ofE. coli cells expressing Y95A-FNR was fractionated with ammonium sulfate between 40% and 70% saturation. The resulting precipitate was dissolved in 40% ammonium sulfate and 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and loaded onto a column of butyl-Toyopearl (Tosoh). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 40% to 0% ammonium sulfate in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The fraction containing Y95A-FNR was further purified on a column of HiTrap Blue (Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), by developing with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in the same buffer. The purity of the enzyme was confirmed by SDS- PAGE. Sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation showed the protein in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 10 °C to be monodisperse with the expected molecular weight. Protein concentrations of the wild-type FNR were determined spectroscopically with an extinction coefficient of 10,000m−1 cm−1 at 460 nm. The concentration of Y95A-FNR was determined by protein assay (DC protein assay kit; Bio-Rad) with wild-type FNR as a standard, and its extinction coefficient at 280 nm was calculated to be 47,800m−1 cm−1. Apo-FNR was prepared by treatment with CaCl2 (17.Zanetti G. Cidaria D. Curti B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Wild-type FNR (100 μm) was diluted in 10 volumes of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 3 mCaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 17% glycerol (v/v), and 100 mm Gdm-HCl. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the solution was passed through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 17% glycerol (v/v), and 100 mmGdm-HCl. The amount of apo-FNR was estimated to be >99%, based on the absorption spectrum of the FAD moiety. The enzymatic activity of FNR was analyzed by NADPH-cytochromec reduction as described previously (20.Hase T. Mizutani S. Mukohata Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 139-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CD measurements were carried out in a J-720WI spectropolarimeter (Jasco). Cuvettes with pathlengths of 1 mm and 1 cm were used for far-UV and near-UV CD, respectively. The results are expressed as the mean residue ellipticity, [θ], defined as [θ] = 100 θobs/l c, where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees, c is the molar concentration of residue, and l is the length of the light path in centimeters. The temperature was controlled at 10 °C with a Jasco PTC-348WI peltier system. The protein concentrations were 4 and 8 μm for far-UV and near-UV CD, respectively. The secondary structure contents were estimated from far-UV CD spectra using two programs, k2d (21.Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) and Selcon (22.Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10022-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 10 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, using a F-4500 fluorometer (Hitachi). The excitation wavelength was 453 nm for the fluorescence spectrum of FAD. The protein concentration was 4 μm, and the temperature was kept at 10 °C in a thermostatically controlled water bath. SAXS measurements were performed at the BL-10C small angle installation of the Photon Factory at the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (Tsukuba, Japan). The sample solution in a cell with a pathlength of 1 mm was irradiated with a monochromatic x-ray beam (1.5 Å). The measurements were carried out at 10 °C with a thermostatically controlled cell holder. The protein concentrations were 50–400 μm. X-ray scattering intensities in the small angle region are given asI(Q) = I(0) exp(− Rg2 Q 2/3), where Q and I(0) are momentum transfer and intensity at 0 scattering angle. Q is defined byQ = (4 π sin θ)/λ, where 2θ and λ are the scattering angle and the wavelength of the x-rays, respectively. The radius of gyration (R g) value was obtained from the slope of the Guinier plot. Data analysis was performed using the IGOR Pro data analysis program (WaveMetrics, Inc.). The P(r) functions were evaluated using the GNOM program (23.Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Equilibrium denaturation experiments with Gdm-HCl were performed at 10 °C. The protein solutions in various concentrations of Gdm-HCl were preincubated for at least 4 h at 10 °C before the experiments. The transitions were followed by far-UV CD and fluorescence of FAD. For CD measurements, the changes in ellipticity at 222 nm were recorded. The relative fluorescence intensities were recorded at 530 nm with an excitation wavelength of 453 nm. The resulting transition curves were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting, assuming a two-state transition (24.Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar) as shown in the following equation. [Signal]={(a+b[D])+(c+d[D])*exp[m([D]−CM)/RT]}/Equation 1 {1+exp[m([D]−CM)/RT]}In this equation, [Signal] is either the ellipticity at 222 nm or fluorescence at 530 nm, a and c are the intercepts, and b and d are the slopes of the base lines for native and unfolded species, respectively, Ris the gas constant, and T is a temperature. [D] andC M are the concentration of Gdm-HCl for each experiment and the concentration at the midpoint of the reaction, respectively. ΔG 0, which is the free energy of unfolding in water, was calculated by the equation ΔG 0 = m C M, wherem is the measure of cooperativity for the transition. The affinities of FNR and its derivatives to NADP+ were measured using a HiTrap Blue prepacked column (Amersham Biosciences) containing 7 μmCibacron 3G-A resin (5 ml), which is an NADP+ analogue. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) using the Äkta Prime system (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. FNR solutions in different conformational states at neutral pH were loaded onto the column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–2m NaCl in the same buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml min−1. Elution of FNR was monitored by the absorption at 280 nm. For chromatography in the presence of NADP+, 0.5 mm NADP+ was present in the buffers and protein samples. Elution was detected by protein assay because of the overlapping absorption of protein and NADP+. FNR holoenzyme is practically nonfluorescent, whereas FNR molecules unbound to FNR show intense fluorescence at around 530 nm. The reconstitution of holoenzyme from apo-FNR was detected by FAD titration assay (17.Zanetti G. Cidaria D. Curti B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was 453 nm, and a cuvette with a pathlength of 5 mm was used. Protein concentrations were 0.3–1.0 μm in 50 mmTris-HCl at pH 7.5. The protein solutions containing various amounts of FAD were incubated for 3 days at 4 °C before fluorescence measurements. We first characterized the acid-induced structural changes in holo-FNR and its relationship with FAD binding ability using CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. Consistent with the results of x-ray crystallography, the far-UV CD spectrum of holo-FNR in its native state at pH 6.0 exhibited a shape typical of α/β proteins (Fig. 2 A). At pH 2.4, holo-FNR showed disruption of its secondary structures to some extent but retained a substantial amount of secondary structure. This suggested the accumulation of partially folded species at pH 2.4. Holo-FNR contains its cofactor, FAD, at the interface between the FAD and NADP+ binding domains. FAD in its free form at neutral pH shows intense fluorescence around 460–700 nm when excited at 453 nm. In contrast, the fluorescence is quenched upon binding to FNR polypeptide (25.Forti G. Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 1966; 19: 195-201PubMed Google Scholar). At pH 2.4, the fluorescence of FAD increased, showing that the cofactor was released upon denaturation of FNR (Fig. 2 B). The pH titration curve obtained by fluorescence analysis coincided well with the transition obtained by far-UV CD (Fig. 2 C). This indicated that pH-dependent dissociation of FAD is a process coupled with the acid unfolding of FNR. The equilibrium unfolding transitions induced by Gdm-HCl were followed by far-UV CD and fluorescence of FAD at pH 2.4 or pH 6.0, 10 °C (Fig. 3). For holo-FNR, a cooperative unfolding transition was obtained by far-UV CD. The transition curve was consistent with the dissociation of FAD monitored by the fluorescence of FAD (Fig. 3; Table I). These observations suggested that the denaturation transition by Gdm-HCl is well approximated by a cooperative two-state mechanism from the native to unfolded state coupled with the loss of FAD binding ability.Table IThermodynamic parameters for the unfolding of holo-FNR in Gdm-HCl at 10 °CpHΔG 01-aFree energy difference between the native and unfolded states in water.m 1-bThe cooperativity index of the transition.C M1-cThe midpoint Gdm-HCl concentration of denaturation.Method(kcal mol−1)(kcal mol−1M−1)(m)6.0−9.15 ± 1.914.48 ± 0.912.04Ellipticity at 222 nm6.0−9.18 ± 1.064.34 ± 0.492.11Fluorescence at 530 nm1-dFluorescence emission at 530 nm with an excitation wavelength of 453 nm.2.4−2.79 ± 0.661.08 ± 0.212.58Ellipticity at 222 nm1-a Free energy difference between the native and unfolded states in water.1-b The cooperativity index of the transition.1-c The midpoint Gdm-HCl concentration of denaturation.1-d Fluorescence emission at 530 nm with an excitation wavelength of 453 nm. Open table in a new tab The conformation of the acid-induced unfolded state at pH 2.4 was more structured than that of Gdm-HCl unfolding (Figs. 2 and 3). Interestingly, a moderately cooperative unfolding transition of the acid-denatured state was induced by Gdm-HCl at pH 2.4. This further supported the idea that persistent structures remained to some extent at pH 2.4 in the absence of denaturants (Fig. 3). However, the loss of cooperativity for the unfolding transition at pH 2.4 relative to the transition at pH 6.0 was well represented by parameter m,obtained by curve-fitting analysis on the basis of a two-state mechanism (Table I). The m value is considered to be correlated with changes in the accessible surface area upon unfolding. Fig. 4 A shows the far-UV CD spectra of various species of FNR at pH 7.5 and 10 °C. By removal of FAD, apo-FNR showed smaller amplitudes of negative ellipticity at 200–235 nm than the holo-protein. Interestingly, the Y95A mutant showed a far-UV CD spectrum similar to that of apo-FNR, indicating that Y95A-FNR assumes a conformation similar to that of apo-FNR. The near-UV CD spectrum of holo-FNR showed a sharp positive peak and negative peaks at 275 and 295 nm, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Movements of particular residues among 32 aromatic amino acids in maize FNR (12 phenylalanines, 6 tryptophans, and 14 tyrosines) are restricted within the tertiary structure of holo-FNR. Y95A-FNR showed a spectrum similar to that of holo-protein but with lower amplitude at 260–320 nm. This suggested that the tertiary structure was disrupted to some extent in Y95A-FNR or that the intrinsic contribution of tyrosine 95 to this CD spectrum was relatively large. On the other hand, apo-FNR exhibited no clear peak at around 275 nm and a small but distinctive negative peak at 295 nm. The broad Cotton effects of holo-FNR in the CD region around 400 nm were probably due to the bound FAD, considering the observation that apo- and Y95A-FNR with no bound FAD indicated no such peaks. Fig. 5 Ashows Guinier plots (ln (I(Q)) versus Q 2) for various species of FNR. The slope of the plot in the low Q region, i.e. small angle, gives the most reliable estimate of radius of gyration (R g), informative for the size and compactness of polypeptide chains (26.Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982Google Scholar). Because the R g value is dependent on protein concentration, the correctedR g values of FNR in the different conformational states shown above were obtained by extrapolating to zero protein concentration. The R g value for holo-FNR was estimated to be 27.0 Å (Table II), whereas apo-FNR had a larger R g value of 48.7 Å. This value was surprisingly consistent with theR g of Y95A-FNR (48.6 Å), another FAD-depleted form. However, these values for FAD-depleted FNR were smaller than theR g of unfolded protein in 4.0 mGdm-HCl (63.1 Å). Consistent with the results obtained by CD spectroscopy, these experimental results supported the idea that apo- and Y95A-FNR assume similar partially folded conformations.Table IIStructural parameters of various states of maize FNRConditionsα-Helix2-aThe secondary structure contents estimated from far-UV CD spectra calculated by k2d/Selcon.β-SheetReminder[θ]222[θ]270R gActivity2-bCytochrome c reductase activity.Shape2-cMolecular shape estimated from the shapes of Kratky plots.NADP+affinity2-dDetermined by the elution from Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography.%%%deg cm2 mol−1deg cm2 mol−1Å%holo-FNR, pH 7.527 /26 (26)2-eFNR x-ray structure.18 /39 (24) 55/35 (50)−930024827.0 ± 0.3100Highly globular+apo-FNR, pH 7.517 /1930 /5353/30−6000248.7 ± 1.20.1Globular+Y95A-FNR, pH 7.516 /1231 /5953/29−48007148.6 ± 0.50.2Globular+unfolded FNR , pH 2.415 /2129 /4855/30−5900−3749.1 ± 1.2ND2-fND, not determined.GlobularNDunfolded FNR ,Gdm-HCl2-gThe unfolded protein was obtained in 4.0 m Gdm-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 °C.5 /647 /6048/33−760−4563.1 ± 2.10Chain-likeND2-a The secondary structure contents estimated from far-UV CD spectra calculated by k2d/Selcon.2-b Cytochrome c reductase activity.2-c Molecular shape estimated from the shapes of Kratky plots.2-d Determined by the elution from Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography.2-e FNR x-ray structure.2-f ND, not determined.2-g The unfolded protein was obtained in 4.0 m Gdm-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 °C. Open table in a new tab The Kratky plot, I(Q) ×Q 2 versus Q, for holo-FNR had a sharp peak at Q = 0.07 (Å−1) and a pattern typical of the native state of a globular protein (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, that in the presence of 4.0 mGdm-HCl was typical of a highly denatured random coil structure,i.e. a plateau in the low Q region followed by a monotonic increase in I(Q) ×Q 2 at higher Q values. The plots for apo- and Y95A-FNR showed intermediate characteristics. They were moderately disordered relative to holo-FNR but still possessed globular components represented by broad peaks around Q = 0.06 (Å−1). The small shifts of such peaks for apo- and Y95A-FNR relative to those of holo-FNR suggested more expanded conformations for apo- and Y95A-FNR. The information regarding molecular shape for each conformational species is summarized in Table II. Information on shape and size can also be obtained from the distribution function, P(r). Fig. 5 Cshows the P(r) functions for holo- and Y95A-FNR. The P(r) function for holo-FNR had a single peak at 26 Å and the maximum chord of the molecule,d max, was 93 Å. The slight distribution over 60 Å could be due to the influence of the fluctuating N-terminal flared tail (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand,P(r) of Y95A-FNR had a single peak at 37 Å, andd max was 121 Å. These distances were clearly larger than the corresponding values of holo-FNR, consistent with the results obtained by analysis of Guinier plots. Unlike theP(r) expected for the complete spherical globule, the P(r) function for this mutant had a broad distribution at a higher r value but no distinctive shoulder. The curve could be expressed as a biphasic function as shown for the molten globule intermediate of apomyoglobin (27.Kataoka M. Nishi I. Fujisawa T. Ueki T. Tokunaga F. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The native holo-FNR consists of two distinctive folding units, i.e. the FAD and NADP+ binding domains. Therefore, it is possible that the partially folded species of FNR formed by the removal of FAD contains a native-like well-defined structure in at least one of the two domains. Indeed, Y95A mutant protein showed significantly high affinity to Cibacron Blue resin with an NADP+ analogue (Fig. 6). The elution time for Y95A-FNR was similar to that for holo-FNR. These observations suggested that Y95A-FNR, which lacks a FAD molecule, might contain the persistent native-like folded NADP+ binding domain. High affinity to this column was also observed for apo-FNR. Elution was shifted to a higher salt concentration than that for holo-FNR. This was probably due to the smaller amount of protein applied to reduce the possibility of forming a precipitate: apo-FNR was prone to aggregate at high protein concentrations. As a negative control, ovalbumin was eluted in the flow-through fraction. Moreover, to confirm the specificity of the interaction of apo-FNR with the NADP+-bound resin, the effects of NADP+ in the buffer were examined. Both holo- and apo-FNR (particularly apo-FNR) eluted faster with the addition of 0.5 mm NADP+ to the sample and elution buffers than they did in its absence. These results showed that NADP+ in solvent competes with NADP+ on the resin, although the competition at 0.5 mm NADP+was not perfect and did not completely prevent binding to the resin. The reconstitution of holo-FNR from apo- and Y95A-FNR was attempted by adding FAD to these FNR derivatives at neutral pH. The equilibrium binding curve of FAD to apo-FNR was followed by quenching of the added FAD fluorescence upon binding to FNR (Fig. 7). The fluorescence was completely quenched when a small amount of FAD (<60% of FNR molecule) was added to the solution, suggesting specific binding of FAD to FNR molecules. However, additional quenching was no longer observed in the presence of FAD at >60% of FNR molecules. The recovery yield of holo-FNR was also estimated by monitoring the enzymatic activity. The reconstitution yield estimated by enzymatic activity (57%) was consistent with the incorporation of FAD (60%) estimated by fluorescence quenching. In contrast to apo-FNR, Y95A-FNR did not show any quenching of FAD fluorescence as well as the enzymatic activity. This was expected because Y95A-FNR probably lacks the ability to bind the FAD molecule due to the removal of the stacking interaction of Tyr95 side chain to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. The present study showed that two apoenzymes of FNR produced by different methods assume partially folded structures rather than being fully unfolded (Tables I and II). The reconstitution of holo-FNR was demonstrated by adding FAD to apo-FNR, suggesting that the partially folded species is a productive intermediate rather than a misfolded state. Residual tertiary structures are present to some extent in apo-FNR, as evident from the peaks in the near-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 4 B). SAXS analysis demonstrated that the apo state retains a globular component, although it is more expanded compared with the native state of holo-FNR (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the ability of FAD-depleted FNR species to bind to NADP+ suggested that some native-like structure is retained at least around the binding site in the NADP+binding domain (Fig. 6). On the other hand, Y95A-FNR had no affinity to a ferredoxin-immobilized Sepharose column (data not shown). These partially folded states of apoenzymes have spectroscopic features similar to the structure formed at pH 2.4 for holo-FNR as well as Y95A mutant at neutral pH (Figs. 2 and 4, Table II). The molten globule intermediates of other proteins are also known to be stabilized at acidic pH and particularly in the presence of added anions (28.Goto Y. Calciano L.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 29.Goto Y. Takahashi N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3480-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The moderately cooperative transition determined by the CD spectra of acid-unfolded FNR confirmed the presence of residual secondary structure (Fig. 3). Partially folded intermediates of multidomain proteins can be composed of well-structured and unstructured domains. For instance, the folding intermediate of hen lysozyme has a well-defined α-domain and a fluctuating β-domain (30.Radford S.E. Dobson C.M. Evans P.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Importantly, experiments on single-domain proteins have suggested that they can also be decomposed into small folding units, i.e. subdomains (31.Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10869-10873Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 32.Philipp S. Kim Y.M. Durr I. Wenzl G. Vogt M. Flecker P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This implies that even a partially folded state of a single-domain protein, which corresponds to the classical molten globule, can contain folded and unfolded subdomains (33.Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 707-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The molten globule was originally defined as an intermediate conformation with a substantial amount of native-like secondary structure but fluctuating tertiary contacts (34.Ohgushi M. Wada A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 35.Dobson C.M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 636-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, experiments on partially folded states of proteins have indicated that there are a variety of intermediate states in terms of the contribution of specific tertiary contacts to stability. In addition, the criteria of a “molten globule” have recently been extended so as to be more realistic in describing a partially folded state. In this sense, the structural properties of apo- and Y95A-FNR can be considered as variations of the molten globule state. One of the most important results obtained here was the persistence of the NADP+ binding domain in the partially folded FNR species. The far-UV CD spectrum of apo-FNR did not change effectively in the presence or absence of NADP+ (data not shown). This means that NADP+ does not induce further conformational rearrangement of the NADP+ binding domain, consistent with the persistence of the NADP+ binding domain. The far-UV CD spectra of these proteins showed ∼50% of the intensity of holo-FNR. We estimated the secondary structure contents of various forms of FNR on the basis of far-UV CD spectra (Table II). The secondary structure contents for holo-FNR were consistent with those determined from x-ray crystallographic data (i.e. 26% α-helix and 24% β-sheet). For the FAD-depleted species, α-helix content decreased, whereas β-sheet content did not decrease notably. Disordering of the α-helix in the FAD binding domain probably explains the decrease of α-helix content. However, because the estimation of β-sheet content from CD is often unreliable, the apparent increases in amount of β-sheet observed for various non-native species cannot be discussed further. The present results did not specify whether apo- and Y95A-FNR have either the partially folded conformation or an expanded structure with respect to the FAD binding domain. Nevertheless, comparison ofR g values of several conformational states of FNR and other proteins suggested that the FAD binding domain may be relatively expanded rather than assuming a compact structure. SAXS results of several proteins showed that the R gvalues of partially folded intermediates are 10–30% larger than the values of the native structures (36.Kataoka M. Goto Y. Folding Des. 1996; 1: R107-R114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On the other hand, theR g value of FAD-depleted FNR was 81.5% larger than the value of holo-FNR. It is likely that the FAD binding domain assumes a rather expanded conformation in FAD-depleted FNR. For proteins consisting of several domains, the stability and cooperativity of the isolated single domains can be lower than those in the completely folded protein, in which they are supported by the neighboring domains (37.Mayr E.-M. Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38.Jaenicke R. Böhm G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The agreement of Gdm-HCl or acid unfolding transitions of holo-FNR with the release of FAD (Fig. 3) suggested that the process can be approximated by the two-state transition. This can be explained by the location of the FAD molecule at the interface between the FAD and NADP+ binding domains of FNR. Such interactions can substantially increase the cooperativity of unfolding transition by stabilizing both domains in the native state. Consistent with this, the structural properties of FAD-depleted FNR suggested that this cooperativity is lost by removal of the cofactor located at the interface of the two domains. An intermediate structure similar to apo-FNR at neutral pH has also been stabilized under unfolding conditions at pH 2.4. In the electrostatic surface potential map of the native structure of holo-FNR, it is obvious that the FAD binding domain has a positively charged surface, whereas the NADP+ binding domain has negative electrostatic potential (Fig. 1 B). This difference in the distribution of electric potential implies that the denaturation of the FAD binding domain can occur more readily at acidic pH than unfolding of the NADP+ binding domain because of the preferential increase of positive charges and hence the electrostatic repulsion in the FAD binding domain. This could result in the formation of an acidic intermediate conformation similar to apo- and Y95A-FNR at neutral pH. The critical role of charge repulsion in protein stability has been indicated in several cases. For example, whereas aspergillopepsin II, an aspartic proteinase composed of many (20% of total) negatively charged residues, is stable at acidic pH, it unfolds at alkaline pH because of the negative charge repulsion (39.Kojima M. Tanokura M. Maeda M. Kimura K. Amemiya Y. Kihara H. Takahashi K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1364-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggested the accumulation of partially folded FNR upon removal of the cofactor, FAD. Many proteins show a less structured conformation relative to the native state upon release of a cofactor at neutral pH. One of the most extreme cases of this is horse cytochromec (40.Hamada D. Hoshino M. Kataoka M. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10351-10358Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This protein has a covalently bound heme group, and removal of this prosthetic group by treatment with Ag2SO4 produces an apoprotein that assumes a relatively unstructured compact state at neutral pH. On the other hand, apomyoglobin derived from removal of a bound heme group in holomyoglobin retains a folded structure with 55% α-helical content (41.Hughson F.M. Wright P.E. Baldwin R.L. Science. 1990; 249: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 42.Eliezer D. Yao J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In this respect, apo-FNR is more similar to apomyoglobin than to apocytochrome c. In contrast, flavodoxin is one of the most well-studied flavoproteins with regard to its stability and folding reaction (43.Genzor C.G. Beldarrain A. Gomez-Moreno C. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Sancho J. Protein Sci. 1996; 7: 1376-1388Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 44.Steensma E. van Mierlo C.P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 653-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of this protein consists of only one domain with a binding site for a flavin mononucleotide, FMN, and assumes the native structure even after the removal of FMN. Several lines of evidence suggest that multidomain flavoproteins including FNR have evolved by the assembly of some single-domain proteins, especially NADP+-binding protein (13.Vallon O. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 38: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 45.Porter T.D. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). FNR may have evolved by such a mechanism. The ancestor of FNR might have had the ability to assume the native structure even without its cofactor at the early stage of evolution. For those proteins with cofactors, the relationship between protein evolution and stability related to cofactor binding is an exciting area of study that may reveal how the proteins have evolved.

These lobes are now known to be powered by jets emanating from black holes at the centers of the galaxies. In his Perspective, Blandford discusses how the black hole may generate the jets. He highlights the report by Koide et al., who have simulated one mechanism for supplying the jets with energy via a magnetic connection to the gas just outside the black hole's event horizon."
