For example, normal adult breast tissue is largely devoid of the ECM protein fibronectin (FN) whereas high FN levels have been detected in the stroma of breast tumors. FN is an established marker for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which occurs during development and has been linked to cancer. During EMT, epithelial cell adhesion switches from cell-cell contacts to mainly cell-ECM interactions, raising the possibility that FN may have a role in promoting this transition. Using MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells, we show that exposure to exogenous FN induces an EMT response including upregulation of the EMT markers FN, Snail, N-cadherin, vimentin, the matrix metalloprotease MMP2, α-smooth muscle actin and phospho-Smad2, as well as acquisition of cell migratory behavior. FN-induced EMT depends on Src kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein (ERK/MAP) kinase signaling but not on the immediate early gene EGR-1. FN initiates EMT under serum-free conditions; this response is partially reversed by a transforming growth factor (TGF)β-neutralizing antibody, suggesting that FN enhances the effect of endogenous TGFβ. EMT marker expression is upregulated in cells on a fragment of FN containing the integrin-binding domain but not other domains. Differences in gene expression between FN and Matrigel are maintained with addition of a subthreshold level of TGFβ1. Together, these results show that cells interacting with FN are primed to respond to TGFβ. The ability of FN to induce EMT shows an active role for the stromal ECM in this process and supports the notion that the increased levels of FN observed in breast tumors facilitate tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2081207002,"Background In the city of Yaoundé in Cameroon malaria is predominately transmitted by the M and S molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae and both are resistant to the pyrethroid insecticides and DDT. Mutations in the target site of these insecticides, present at a high frequency in malaria vectors in this city, contribute to this resistance profile. To identify additional resistance mechanisms, the expression profile of multiple DDT-resistant field populations of M and S molecular forms was compared to laboratory-susceptible populations. Methodology/Principal findings The prevalence of DDT resistance was highest in the S form population originating from the cultivated site of Nkolondom (mortality after WHO bioassay = 4%). A high prevalence of DDT resistance was also found in two urban M form populations, Messa from a pristine unpolluted environment (DDT mortality = 54%), and Gare, where the breeding sites are heavily polluted with organic matter (DDT mortality = 38%). Microarray analysis showed that several transcripts coding for detoxification enzymes (P450s, GSTs and UDPGTs) and ABC transporters were upregulated in the three populations. Despite the presence of multiple detoxification genes over expressed in the DDT-resistant subset of these field populations, only three were commonly over expressed in resistant populations from all three environments. Two of these genes, CYP6M2 and GSTD1-6, encode enzymes that have been previously shown to metabolize DDT. Conclusion/Significance Analogous to target site resistance, genes involved in metabolic resistance to DDT are also shared between the M and S forms of An gambiae. Alternative explanations for this occurrence are explored."
https://openalex.org/W2101674608,"The E7 protein of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) type 16, being involved in malignant cellular transformation, represents a key antigen for developing therapeutic vaccines against HPV-related lesions and cancers. Recombinant production of this vaccine antigen in an active form and in compliance with good manufacturing practices (GMP) plays a crucial role for developing effective vaccines. E7-based therapeutic vaccines produced in plants have been shown to be active in tumor regression and protection in pre-clinical models. However, some drawbacks of in whole-plant vaccine production encouraged us to explore the production of the E7-based therapeutic vaccine in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, an organism easy to grow and transform and fully amenable to GMP guidelines.An expression cassette encoding E7GGG, a mutated, attenuated form of the E7 oncoprotein, alone or as a fusion with affinity tags (His6 or FLAG), under the control of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast psbD 5' UTR and the psbA 3' UTR, was introduced into the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome by homologous recombination. The protein was mostly soluble and reached 0.12% of total soluble proteins. Affinity purification was optimized and performed for both tagged forms. Induction of specific anti-E7 IgGs and E7-specific T-cell proliferation were detected in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated with total Chlamydomonas extract and with affinity-purified protein. High levels of tumor protection were achieved after challenge with a tumor cell line expressing the E7 protein.The C. reinhardtii chloroplast is a suitable expression system for the production of the E7GGG protein, in a soluble, immunogenic form. The production in contained and sterile conditions highlights the potential of microalgae as alternative platforms for the production of vaccines for human uses."
https://openalex.org/W1970323663,"Elevated activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade is found in the majority of human melanomas and is known to regulate proliferation, survival and invasion. Current targeted therapies focus on decreasing the activity of this pathway; however, we do not fully understand how these therapies impact tumor biology, especially given that melanoma is a heterogeneous disease. Using a three-dimensional (3D), collagen-embedded spheroid melanoma model, we observed that MEK and BRAF inhibitors can increase the invasive potential of ∼20% of human melanoma cell lines. The invasive cell lines displayed increased receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity and activation of the Src/FAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling axis, also associated with increased cell-to-cell adhesion and cadherin engagement following MEK inhibition. Targeting various RTKs, Src, FAK and STAT3 with small molecule inhibitors in combination with a MEK inhibitor prevented the invasive phenotype, but only STAT3 inhibition caused cell death in the 3D context. We further show that STAT3 signaling is induced in BRAF-inhibitor-resistant cells. Our findings suggest that MEK and BRAF inhibitors can induce STAT3 signaling, causing potential adverse effects such as increased invasion. We also provide the rationale for the combined targeting of the MAPK pathway along with inhibitors of RTKs, SRC or STAT3 to counteract STAT3-mediated resistance phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2019077234,"The orexin system plays a central role in the integration of sleep/wake and feeding behaviors in a broad spectrum of neural-metabolic physiology. Orexin-A and orexin-B are produced by the cleavage of prepro-orexin, which is encoded on the Hcrt gene. To date, methods for generating other peptide neurons could not induce orexin neurons from pluripotent stem cells. Considering that the metabolic status affects orexin expression, we supplemented the culture medium with a nutrient factor, ManNAc, and succeeded in generating functional orexin neurons from mouse ES cells. Because DNA methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors could induce Hcrt expression in mouse ES cells, the epigenetic mechanism may be involved in this orexin neurogenesis. DNA methylation analysis showed the presence of a tissue-dependent differentially methylated region (T-DMR) around the transcription start site of the Hcrt gene. In the orexin neurons induced by supplementation of ManNAc, the T-DMR of the Hcrt gene was hypomethylated in association with higher H3/H4 acetylation. Concomitantly, the histone acetyltransferases p300, CREB-binding protein (CBP), and Mgea5 (also called O-GlcNAcase) were localized to the T-DMR in the orexin neurons. In non-orexin-expressing cells, H3/H4 hypoacetylation and hyper-O-GlcNAc modification were observed at the T-DMRs occupied by O-GlcNAc transferase and Sirt1. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that the glucose metabolite, ManNAc, induces switching from the inactive state by Ogt-Sirt1 to the active state by Mgea5, p300, and CBP at the Hcrt gene locus."
https://openalex.org/W2019544391,"High fat diet (HFD) is closely linked to a variety of health issues including fatty liver. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a synthetic perfluorinated carboxylic acid, also causes liver injury. The present study investigated the possible interactions between high fat diet and PFOA in induction of liver injury. Mice were pair-fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or low fat control with or without PFOA administration at 5 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. Exposure to PFOA alone caused elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and increased liver weight along with reduced body weight and adipose tissue mass. HFD alone did not cause liver damage, but exaggerated PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity as indicated by higher plasma ALT and AST levels, and more severe pathological changes including hepatocyte hypertrophy, lipid droplet accumulation and necrosis as well as inflammatory cell infiltration. These additive effects of HFD on PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity correlated with metabolic disturbance in liver and blood as well as up-regulation of hepatic proinflammatory cytokine genes. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that both serum and hepatic metabolite profiles of PFOA, HFD, or HFD-PFOA group were clearly differentiated from that of controls. PFOA affected more hepatic metabolites than HFD, but HFD showed positive interaction with PFOA on fatty acid metabolites including long chain fatty acids and acylcarnitines. Taken together, dietary high fat potentiates PFOA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and necrotic cell death by disturbing hepatic metabolism and inducing inflammation. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that HFD increases the risk of PFOA in induction of hepatotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1969016022,"Accumulation of peptide-linked DNA breaks contributes to neurodegeration in humans. This is typified by defects in tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and human hereditary ataxia. TDP1 primarily operates at single-strand breaks (SSBs) created by oxidative stress or by collision of transcription machinery with topoisomerase I intermediates (Top1-CCs). Cellular and cell-free studies have shown that Top1 at stalled Top1-CCs is first degraded to a small peptide resulting in Top1-SSBs, which are the primary substrates for TDP1. Here we established an assay to directly compare Top1-SSBs and Top1-CCs. We subsequently employed this assay to reveal an increased steady state level of Top1-CCs in neural cells lacking Atm; the protein mutated in ataxia telangiectasia. Our data suggest that the accumulation of endogenous Top1-CCs in Atm-/- neural cells is primarily due to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. Biochemical purification of Top1-CCs from neural cell extract and the use of Top1 poisons further confirmed a role for Atm during the formation/resolution of Top1-CCs. Finally, we report that global transcription is reduced in Atm-/- neural cells and fails to recover to normal levels following Top1-mediated DNA damage. Together, these data identify a distinct role for ATM during the formation/resolution of neural Top1-CCs and suggest that their accumulation contributes to the neuropathology of ataxia telangiectasia."
https://openalex.org/W2146144168,"In lung cancers, TTF-1 displays seemingly paradoxical activities. Although TTF-1 is amplified in primary human lung cancers, it inhibits primary lung tumors from metastasizing in a mouse model system. It was reported that the oncogenic proepithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) high mobility group AT-hook 2 gene (HMGA2) mediates the antimetastatic function of TTF-1. To gain mechanistic insight into the metastasis-critical signaling axis of TTF-1 to HMGA2, we used both reverse and forward strategies and discovered that microRNA-33a (miR-33a) is under direct positive regulation of TTF-1. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, we determined that TTF-1 binds to the promoter of SREBF2, the host gene of miR-33a. The 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of HMGA2 contains three predicted binding sites of miR-33a. We showed that the first two highly conserved sites are conducive to HMGA2 repression by miR-33a, establishing HMGA2 as a genuine target of miR-33a. Functional studies revealed that enforced expression of miR-33a inhibits the motility of lung cancer cells, and this inhibition can be rescued by overexpression of the form of HMGA2 without the 3′-UTR, suggesting that TTF-1 keeps the prometastasis gene HMGA2 in check via up-regulating miR-33a. This study reports the first miRNAs directly regulated by TTF-1 and clarifies how TTF-1 controls HMGA2 expression. Moreover, the documented importance of SREBF2 and miR-33a in regulating cholesterol metabolism suggests that TTF-1 may be a modulator of cholesterol homeostasis in the lung. Future studies will be dedicated to understanding how miRNAs influence the oncogenic activity of TTF-1 and the role of TTF-1 in cholesterol metabolism.Background: TTF-1 inhibits lung cancer progression via HMGA2 down-regulation.Results: TTF-1 up-regulates miR-33a, which in turn directly represses HMGA2.Conclusion: The signaling axis of TTF-1 to HMGA2, important in controlling lung cancer metastasis, is mediated by miR-33a.Significance: This study explains the mechanism of HMGA2 suppression by TTF-1.

https://openalex.org/W1999400923,"The functional diversity of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) is not well understood. The MJD family of DUBs consists of four cysteine proteases that share a catalytic “Josephin” domain. The family is named after the DUB ATXN3, which causes the neurodegenerative disease Machado-Joseph disease. The two closely related Josephin domain-containing (JosD) proteins 1 and 2 consist of little more than the Josephin domain. To gain insight into the properties of Josephin domains, we investigated JosD1 and JosD2. JosD1 and JosD2 were found to differ fundamentally in many respects. In vitro, only JosD2 can cleave ubiquitin chains. In contrast, JosD1 cleaves ubiquitin chains only after it is monoubiquitinated, a form of posttranslational-dependent regulation shared with ATXN3. A significant fraction of JosD1 is monoubiquitinated in diverse mouse tissues. In cell-based studies, JosD2 localizes to the cytoplasm whereas JosD1 preferentially localizes to the plasma membrane, particularly when ubiquitinated. The membrane occupancy by JosD1 suggests that it could participate in membrane-dependent events such as cell motility and endocytosis. Indeed, time-lapse imaging revealed that JosD1 enhances membrane dynamics and cell motility. JosD1 also influences endocytosis in cultured cells by increasing the uptake of endocytic markers of macropinocytosis while decreasing those for clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis.

Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). By controlling this critical post-translational modification, DUBs regulate cellular processes and pathways from gene transcription to protein degradation (2Burrows J.F. Johnston J.A. Regulation of cellular responses by deubiquitinating enzymes: an update.Front. Biosci. 2012; 17: 1184-1200Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The importance of DUBs to cellular health and homeostasis is underscored by links to malignancies and neurological diseases (3Sippl W. Collura V. Colland F. Ubiquitin-specific proteases as cancer drug targets.Future Oncol. 2011; 7: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Todi S.V. Paulson H.L. Balancing act: deubiquitinating enzymes in the nervous system.Trends Neurosci. 2011; 34: 370-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). According to a recent study, most DUBs in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster were required developmentally or in adults (5Tsou W.L. Sheedlo M.J. Morrow M.E. Blount J.R. McGregor K.M. Das C. Todi S.V. Systematic analysis of the physiological importance of deubiquitinating enzymes.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e43112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nearly 100 potential DUBs are encoded by the human genome, classified into five distinct families based on similarities in the catalytic domain: UCHs, USPs, MJDs, OTUs, and JAMMs (1Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Except for JAMM DUBs, which are zinc-dependent metalloproteases, all other DUB families are cysteine proteases. DUB activity can be regulated at several levels including translation, degradation, post-translational modification, substrate-induced conformational change, and functional interactions with other proteins. Although some DUBs have been studied extensively (2Burrows J.F. Johnston J.A. Regulation of cellular responses by deubiquitinating enzymes: an update.Front. Biosci. 2012; 17: 1184-1200Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), little is known about the activity, expression, and function of most DUBs. The smallest family of DUBs is the MJD class, which includes four proteins: ataxin-3 (ATXN3), ataxin-3-like (ATXN3L) and Josephin domain-containing proteins 1 and 2 (JosD1 and JosD2) (1Komander D.

Balancing act: deubiquitinating enzymes in the nervous system.Trends Neurosci. 2011; 34: 370-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All share a highly conserved “Josephin” catalytic domain, named after the neurodegenerative disease Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), which is caused by a polyglutamine expansion mutation in ATXN3. Because of its link to disease, ATXN3 is the best studied member of the MJD family. ATXN3 contains an N-terminal catalytic Josephin domain, which is globular and conserved among MJD family members, and a flexible C-terminal region that includes three Ub-interacting motifs (UIMs) flanking the polyglutamine domain (6Costa Mdo C. Paulson H.L. Toward understanding Machado-Joseph disease.Prog. Neurobiol. 2012; 97: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). ATXN3 displays several remarkable properties. For example, its activity is directly regulated by ubiquitination, which enhances AXTN3-mediated cleavage of Ub chains (7Todi S.V. Winborn B.J. Scaglione K.M. Blount J.R. Travis S.M. Paulson H.L.

Toward understanding Machado-Joseph disease.Prog. Neurobiol. 2012; 97: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Approximately 180 amino acids long, the Josephin catalytic domain is the unifying feature of the MJD DUBs. ATXN3 and ATXN3L also share the UIMs and the polyglutamine domain, whereas JosD1 and JosD2 contain essentially only the catalytic Josephin domain (Fig. 1A) (1Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). The catalytic residues within the Josephin domain are relatively conserved among MJD DUBs (Fig. 1B). Whereas JosD1 and JosD2 represent distinct orthologs in vertebrates, only one JosD1/2-related gene is identified in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila (5Tsou W.L. Sheedlo M.J. Morrow M.E.

The functions of JosD1 and JosD2 are unknown. To expand general understanding of DUB activity and to explore the potential roles of the MJD family DUBs, we chose to investigate JosD1 and JosD2. Defining the properties of these two closely related proteins that seemingly comprise only the Josephin domain also may shed light on why the disease protein ATXN3 possesses a C-terminal extension with multiple UIMs and polyglutamine domain. Our results show that, despite their structural similarity, JosD1 and JosD2 differ with respect to base-line catalytic activity, modification by ubiquitin, and subcellular localization. We also find that, similar to ATXN3 (7Todi S.V. Winborn B.J. Scaglione K.M. Blount J.R. Travis S.M. Paulson H.L.

Finally, we show that JosD1 tends to localize to the plasma membrane, especially when ubiquitinated, where it influences membrane dynamics, cell motility and endocytosis. For recombinant protein expression, ATXN3, JosD1, and JosD2 constructs were subcloned into pGEX6P1 (for GST-tagged, GE Healthcare) and pET28a (for His-tagged; Millipore). For mammalian cell expression, JosD1 and JosD2 constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO (Invitrogen) to fuse with V5 tag, into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to fuse with GFP, and into pFLAG-CMV-6c (Sigma) to fuse with FLAG tag. The HA-ubiquitin construct was subcloned into pRcCMV. The QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) was used to generate catalytically inactive mutants. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Recombinant proteins were prepared as described previously (12Todi S.V. Laco M.N. Winborn B.J. Travis S.M. Wen H.M. Paulson H.L.

Recombinant His-tagged JosD1 and JosD2 (2 μm) were incubated with 2 μm Ub-VS at 37 °C for 15 or 360 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and boiling. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-His tag antibody. Because Ub-VS forms a covalent bond resistant to Laemmli buffer, the Ub-VS-modified proteins electrophorese as higher molecular mass proteins. DUB activity was also assessed by the cleavage of Ub-AMC, a fluorescent probe, as described previously (14Burnett B. Li F. Pittman R.N.

Ubiquitination directly enhances activity of the deubiquitinating enzyme ataxin-3.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ub chains (300–400 nm; Boston Biochem) were incubated with recombinant JosD1 or JosD2 (50–100 nm) in DUB reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.5) at 37 °C for the indicated times or overnight. Reactions were stopped by adding 2% SDS buffer and boiling. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Ub rabbit polyclonal antibody (Dako). In vitro ubiquitination of recombinant JosD1 and JosD2 was conducted as described previously (7Todi S.V. Winborn B.J. Scaglione K.M. Blount J.R. Travis S.M. Paulson H.L. Ubiquitination directly enhances activity of the deubiquitinating enzyme ataxin-3.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-JosD1 or GST-JosD2 was incubated with 1 μm CHIP, 8 μm UbcH5c, 0.16 μm E1, 50 μm ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), 4.5 μm MgCl2, and 4.5 μm ATP in kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm DTT, pH 7.5) for 2 h at 37 °C. Various mouse tissues were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich) using a Dounce homogenizer. Equal amounts of proteins from these tissues were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-JosD1 rabbit polyclonal antibody, generated by Sigma Genosys using recombinant JosD1 peptide. HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were cultured and maintained as described previously (15Berke S.J. Chai Y. Marrs G.L. Wen H. Paulson H.L. Defining the role of ubiquitin-interacting motifs in the polyglutamine disease protein, ataxin-3.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32026-32034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were harvested in SDS (2%) buffer supplemented with 100 mm DTT 2–3 days after transfection. Lysates were boiled for 15 min, brought to room temperature, centrifuged, and loaded onto 10, 12, or 15% SDS-PAGE gels. To examine subcellular localization of JosD1 and JosD2, proteins of transfected HEK-293 cells were fractionated into cytosolic (S), membrane (M), nuclear (N), and cytoskeletal (CS) fractions using the ProteoExtract subcellular proteome extraction kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The protein concentration of each fraction was quantified using Protein Quantification Assay kit (Macerey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) For experiments examining ubiquitination of JosD1 in cells, we conducted stringent denature/renature immunopurification as described previously (12Todi S.V. Laco M.N. Winborn B.J. Travis S.M. Wen H.M. Paulson H.L. Cellular turnover of the polyglutamine disease protein ataxin-3 is regulated by its catalytic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29348-29358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells transfected to express JosD1-V5 and HA-Ub were lysed in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors, denatured for 30 min by adding SDS to 1%, and then renatured in additional 4.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Lysates were then incubated with anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4 °C, rinsed four times with RIPA + protease inhibitors, eluted with Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Ubiquitination of JosD1 was determined by immunoblotting with anti-V5 (Invitrogen) and anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibodies). To detect interactions of JosD1/JosD2 with other proteins, we pulled down V5-tagged JosD1/JosD2 with nickel-agarose beads, made possible because the vector used to fuse V5 to JosD1 or Jos D2 also contains a His tag next to the V5 tag. Transfected cells expressing JosD1-V5 or JosD2-V5 were lysed with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors and 5 mm imidazole to minimize nonspecific binding to the beads. Lysates were incubated with nickel-agarose beads (EZview red HIS-select HC nickel affinity gel; Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C, rinsed four times with lysis buffer with protease inhibitors, and eluted with lysis buffer containing 1 m imidazole. Pulldown products and input lysates (5–10%) were immunoblotted with anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-α-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technologies), and anti-V5 antibodies. Immunofluorescence was conducted as described previously (16Seki T. Yoshino K.I. Tanaka S. Dohi E. Onji T. Yamamoto K. Hide I. Paulson H.L. Saito N. Sakai N. Establishment of a novel fluorescence-based method to evaluate chaperone-mediated autophagy in a single neuron.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e31232Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated onto glass-bottom dishes 1 day after transfection. After further cultivation for 1–2 days, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by membrane permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen; 1:1000) or rabbit anti-early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) (Affinity BioReagents; 1:500)) for >1 h, followed by incubation with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (1:500), Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse IgG (1:500), or Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rabbit IgG (1:500); Invitrogen) for at least 1 h. For F-actin staining, phalloidin-TRITC (100 nm; Invitrogen) was incubated with fixed cells expressing GFP-JosD1 after membrane permeabilization. Single optical plane images were obtained with an A1 confocal microscope (Nikon). One day after transfection of GFP or GFP-JosD1, HEK-293 cells were detached and plated onto glass-bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) at 0.5–1 × 104 cells/dish. After another day of cultivation, GFP fluorescence and bright field images were monitored in living cells using Deltavison-RT live imaging system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Images were obtained every 2 min for 60 min. To quantify changes in cell morphology, we drew a circle to fit the outermost cell edges at every 10-min interval. We estimated morphological changes by the changes in circle diameter in each 10-min interval. Cell motility was evaluated by the distance that the center of the nucleus (a proxy for the cell center) moved in 10 min. The mean value of six different time intervals (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, 50–60 min) represents an estimate of morphological change or cell motility for each cell. Duration of blebbing was evaluated by the number of sequential images in which a cell had any detectable blebs. JosD1-V5-transfected cells were plated onto glass-bottom dishes as described above. Two days after transfection, cells were incubated with Lucifer Yellow (LY, 1 mg/ml; Sigma) for 1 h, with transferrin (Tf) fused with Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen; 10 μg/ml for clathrin-mediated endocytosis) for 5 min, or cholera toxin subunit B (CTxB) fused with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen; 1 μg/ml for caveolae-mediated endocytosis) for 5 min to visualize fluid-phase, clathrin-mediated, or caveolae-mediated endocytosis, respectively. After incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained with anti-V5 antibody. To visualize macropinocytosis, GFP-JosD1 was transfected instead of JosD1-V5, and cells were incubated for 1 h with dextran 70-kDa protein (Dex) conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) (0.5 mg/ml; Invitrogen). Single optical plane fluorescence images were obtained using the A1 confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Each fluorescence image contains cells both expressing and not expressing JosD1 to compare the uptake of fluorescence markers. Uptake of these markers was quantified by computer-based analysis using ImageJ software. We evaluated the mean fluorescence intensity from whole cells and the number and mean intensity of fluorescent puncta per cell. To analyze immunoblot results, immunoblots were scanned using a scanner, and images were collected in Adobe Photoshop. Densitometry was measured using ImageJ software. To analyze results from immunofluorescence and fluorescence marker uptake quantitatively, single optical plane fluorescence images obtained by a confocal microscopy were analyzed using ImageJ software, as described above. All data are represented as the percentage of the average values from nonexpressing cells. Unpaired Student's t test was used to determine statistical differences between two groups indicated in figure legends. Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used to conduct Student's t test and to generate graphs. We employed two common methods to assess in vitro the activity of recombinant JosD1 and JosD2. First, we used the suicide probe Ub-VS, an inhibitor of cysteine protease DUBs that reacts with and inactivates the catalytic cysteine. Recombinant JosD1 and JosD2 both reacted with Ub-VS (Fig. 1C). Although we commonly observed complete or nearly complete reaction of JosD2 with Ub-VS, not all JosD1 was modified by Ub-VS regardless of the tag used (GST, maltose-binding protein, or His6). Thus, a portion of bacterially expressed JosD1 is inactive, which could result from the propensity of bacterially expressed JosD1 to aggregate. 4T. Seki, L. Gong, A. J. Williams, N. Sakai, S. V. Todi, and H. L. Paulson, unpublished observations. Second, we tested the ability of both proteins to cleave Ub from a fluorescent probe (Ub-AMC). As shown in Fig. 1D, both JosD1 and JosD2 cleaved Ub from the probe. Mutating the catalytic cysteine of each DUB abolished this activity (C14A for ATXN3, C36A for JosD1, and C24A for JosD2, Fig. 1B). These results confirm that JosD1 and JosD2 are active DUBs in vitro. We next assessed the ability of recombinant JosD1 and JosD2 to cleave Ub chains of different lengths in vitro. We tested Lys48-linked Ub chains, which commonly target proteins for degradation, and Lys63-linked Ub chains, most often linked to nondegradative pathways. Interestingly, we observed only minimal activity from JosD1 toward either type of Ub chain (Fig. 1E) even though JosD1 is clearly active against mono-Ub probes (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, JosD2 cleaves both types of chains, although it appears to have a preference for Lys63 linkages (Fig. 1E). In efforts to generate antibodies against JosD1 and JosD2, we succeeded in obtaining an antibody reactive against JosD1 but not JosD2 (Fig. 2A). This antibody allowed us to examine JosD1 expression in mice. As shown in Fig. 2B, JosD1 is expressed in all tissues tested. In addition to the main JosD1-reactive band, more slowly migrating JosD1-positive bands were also seen. These could represent ubiquitinated forms of JosD1, as described for ATXN3 (7Todi S.V. Winborn B.J. Scaglione K.M. Blount J.R. Travis S.M. Paulson H.L.

Indeed, stringent immunopurification of JosD1 from cells expressing tagged forms of JosD1 and ubiquitin established that a substantial fraction of JosD1 is ubiquitinated in cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, JosD2 does not appear to be ubiquitinated in cells under similar experimental conditions (data not shown). These data demonstrate that JosD1 is expressed widely and is prone to be ubiquitinated in cells. Monoubiquitination of ATXN3 directly enhances its DUB activity in vitro and modulates function in cultured cells (7Todi S.V. Winborn B.J. Scaglione K.M. Blount J.R. Travis S.M. Paulson H.L. Ubiquitination directly enhances activity of the deubiquitinating enzyme ataxin-3.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Todi S.V. Scaglione K.M. Blount J.R. Basrur V.

Chem. 2010; 285: 39303-39313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because a fraction of JosD1 is ubiquitinated in cells (Fig. 2, A–C), we tested whether ubiquitination similarly regulates the DUB activity of JosD1. To generate ubiquitinated JosD1, we employed the E3 ligase CHIP because the Josephin domain of ATXN3 is known to be ubiquitinated in vitro by this ligase (8Todi S.V. Scaglione K.M. Blount J.R. Basrur V. Conlon K.P. Pastore A. Elenitoba-Johnson K. Paulson H.L. Activity and cellular functions of the deubiquitinating enzyme and polyglutamine disease protein ataxin-3 are regulated by ubiquitination at lysine 117.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 39303-39313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results in transfected cells, CHIP ubiquitinated JosD1 in vitro, but failed to ubiquitinate JosD2 (Fig. 2D). Purified JosD1 from in vitro ubiquitination reactions was then tested for ability to cleave Ub chains. Compared with unmodified JosD1, a mixture of ubiquitinated and unmodified JosD1 showed enhanced catalytic activity toward Ub chains (Fig. 2E). Thus, we conclude that ubiquitination positively regulates the DUB activity of JosD1 in vitro as is true for at least one other MJD family member, ATXN3. Because our JosD1 antibodies do not reliably detect endogenous JosD1 in fixed tissue or cells, we expressed V5-tagged JosD1 and JosD2 (JosD1-V5 and JosD2-V5) in various cell lines to examine their subcellular localization. For our analysis, we excluded cells expressing epitope-tagged JosD1 or JosD2 with very high levels because they can give spurious results regarding subcellular localization. As shown in Fig. 3A, JosD1 localizes to the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic puncta in HEK-293 cells, whereas JosD2 is diffusely cytoplasmic. Neither protein localized to the nucleus, distinguishing them from ATXN3 which shuttles in and out of the nucleus (6Costa Mdo C. Paulson H.L. Toward understanding Machado-Joseph disease.Prog.

https://openalex.org/W2136047670,"Bivalves play vital roles in marine, brackish, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. In recent years, these ecosystems have become affected through anthropogenic activities. The ecological success of marine bivalves is based on the ability to modify their physiological functions in response to environmental changes. One of the most important mechanisms involved in adaptive responses to environmental and biological stresses is apoptosis, which has been scarcely studied in mollusks, although the final consequence of this process, DNA fragmentation, has been frequently used for pollution monitoring. Environmental stressors induce apoptosis in molluscan cells via an intrinsic pathway. Many of the proteins involved in vertebrate apoptosis have been recognized in model invertebrates; however, this process might not be universally conserved. Mytilus galloprovincialis is presented here as a new model to study the linkage between molecular mechanisms that mediate apoptosis and marine bivalve ecological adaptations. Therefore, it is strictly necessary to identify the key elements involved in bivalve apoptosis. In the present study, six mitochondrial apoptotic-related genes were characterized, and their gene expression profiles following UV irradiation were evaluated. This is the first step for the development of potential biomarkers to assess the biological responses of marine organisms to stress. The results confirmed that apoptosis and, more specifically, the expression of the genes involved in this process can be used to assess the biological responses of marine organisms to stress."
https://openalex.org/W2092503084,"The mitochondrial outer membrane contains proteinaceous machineries for the import and assembly of proteins, including TOM (translocase of the outer membrane) and SAM (sorting and assembly machinery). It has been shown that the dimeric phospholipid cardiolipin is required for the stability of TOM and SAM complexes and thus for the efficient import and assembly of β-barrel proteins and some α-helical proteins of the outer membrane. Here, we report that mitochondria deficient in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the second non-bilayer-forming phospholipid, are impaired in the biogenesis of β-barrel proteins, but not of α-helical outer membrane proteins. The stability of TOM and SAM complexes is not disturbed by the lack of PE. By dissecting the import steps of β-barrel proteins, we show that an early import stage involving translocation through the TOM complex is affected. In PE-depleted mitochondria, the TOM complex binds precursor proteins with reduced efficiency. We conclude that PE is required for the proper function of the TOM complex."
https://openalex.org/W2042516525,"Transmigration through the endothelium is a key step in the immune response. In our recent work, the mechanical properties of the subendothelial matrix and biophysical state of the endothelium have been identified as key modulators of leukocyte trans-endothelial migration. Here, we demonstrated that neutrophil contractile forces and cytoskeletal dynamics also play an active biophysical role during transmigration through endothelial cell-cell junctions. Using our previously-established model for leukocyte transmigration, we first discovered that >93% of human neutrophils preferentially exploit the paracellular mode of transmigration in our in vitro model, and that is independent of subendothelial matrix stiffness. We demonstrated that inhibition of actin polymerization or depolymerization completely blocks transmigration, thus establishing a critical role for neutrophil actin dynamics in transmigration. Next, inhibition of neutrophil myosin II-mediated contractile forces renders 44% of neutrophils incapable of retracting their trailing edge under the endothelium for several minutes after the majority of the neutrophil transmigrates. Meanwhile, inhibition of neutrophil contractile forces or stabilization of microtubules doubles the time to complete transmigration for the first neutrophils to cross the endothelium. Notably, the time to complete transmigration is significantly reduced for subsequent neutrophils that cross through the same path as a previous neutrophil and is less dependent on neutrophil contractile forces and microtubule dynamics. These results suggest that the first neutrophil induces a gap in endothelial cell-cell adhesions, which “opens the door” in the endothelium and facilitates transmigration of subsequent neutrophils through the same hole. Collectively, this work demonstrates that neutrophils play an active biophysical role during the transmigration step of the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1972032147,"The Ca(2+) sensor STIM1 is crucial for activation of store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) through transient receptor potential canonical and Orai channels. STIM1 phosphorylation serves as an ""off switch"" for SOCE. However, the signaling pathway for STIM1 phosphorylation is unknown. Here, we show that SOCE activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); its effector p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38β MAPK) phosphorylates STIM1, thus inhibiting SOCE in human lung microvascular endothelial cells. Activation of AMPK using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) resulted in STIM1 phosphorylation on serine residues and prevented protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1)-induced Ca(2+) entry. Furthermore, AICAR pretreatment blocked PAR-1-induced increase in the permeability of mouse lung microvessels. Activation of SOCE with thrombin caused phosphorylation of isoform α1 but not α2 of the AMPK catalytic subunit. Moreover, knockdown of AMPKα1 augmented SOCE induced by thrombin. Interestingly, SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK, blocked STIM1 phosphorylation and led to sustained STIM1-puncta formation and Ca(2+) entry. Of the three p38 MAPK isoforms expressed in endothelial cells, p38β knockdown prevented PAR-1-mediated STIM1 phosphorylation and potentiated SOCE. In addition, inhibition of the SOCE downstream target CaM kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) or knockdown of AMPKα1 suppressed PAR-1-mediated phosphorylation of p38β and hence STIM1. Thus, our findings demonstrate that SOCE activates CaMKKβ-AMPKα1-p38β MAPK signaling to phosphorylate STIM1, thereby suppressing endothelial SOCE and permeability responses."
https://openalex.org/W2094900559,"The ATP-dependent Clp protease (ClpP) plays an essential role not only in the control of protein quality but also in the regulation of bacterial pathogen virulence, making it an attractive target for antibacterial treatment. We have previously determined the crystal structures of Staphylococcus aureus ClpP (SaClpP) in two different states, extended and compressed. To investigate the dynamic switching of ClpP between these states, we performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations. During the structural transition, the long and straight helix E in the extended SaClpP monomer underwent an unfolding/refolding process, resulting in a kinked helix very similar to that in the compressed monomer. As a stable intermediate in the molecular dynamics simulation, the compact state was suggested and subsequently identified in x-ray crystallographic experiment. Our combined studies also determined that Ala(140) acted as a ""hinge"" during the transition between the extended and compressed states, and Glu(137) was essential for stabilizing the compressed state. Overall, this study provides molecular insights into the dynamics and mechanism of the functional conformation changes of SaClpP. Given the highly conserved sequences of ClpP proteins among different species, these findings potentially reflect a switching mechanism for the dynamic process shared in the whole ClpP family in general and thus aid in better understand the principles of Clp protease assembly and function."
https://openalex.org/W2170043301,"During either production or storage, the LC214-HC220 disulfide in therapeutic antibodies can convert to a thioether bond. Here we report that a thioether forms at the same position on antibodies in vivo. An IgG1κ therapeutic antibody dosed in humans formed a thioether at this position at a rate of about 0.1%/day while circulating in blood. Thioether modifications were also found at this position in endogenous antibodies isolated from healthy human subjects, at levels consistent with this conversion rate. For both endogenous antibodies and recombinant antibodies studied in vivo, thioether conversion rates were faster for IgG1 antibodies containing λ light chains than those containing κ light chains. These light chain reaction rate differences were replicated in vitro. Additional mechanistic studies showed that base-catalyzed thioether formation through the light chain dehydrogenation was more preferred on antibodies with λ light chains, which may help explain the observed reaction rate differences."
https://openalex.org/W2046659393,"EGFR overexpression and chromosome 3p deletion are two frequent events in head and neck cancers. We previously mapped the smallest region of recurrent copy-number loss at 3p12.2-p14.1. LRIG1, a negative regulator of EGFR, was found at 3p14, and its copy-number loss correlated with poor clinical outcome. Inducible expression of LRIG1 in head and neck cancer TW01 cells, a line with low LRIG1 levels, suppressed cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Gene expression profiling, quantitative RT–PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and western blot analysis demonstrated that LRIG1 modulated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and EGFR-MAPK-SPHK1 transduction pathway by suppressing expression of EGFR ligands/activators, MMPs and SPHK1. In addition, LRIG1 induction triggered cell morphology changes and integrin inactivation, which coupled with reduced SNAI2 expression. By contrast, knockdown of endogenous LRIG1 in TW06 cells, a line with normal LRIG1 levels, significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness. Such tumor-promoting effects could be abolished by specific MAPK or SPHK1 inhibitors. Our data suggest LRIG1 as a tumor suppressor for head and neck cancers; LRIG1 downregulation in cancer cells enhances EGFR-MAPK-SPHK1 signaling and ECM remodeling activity, leading to malignant phenotypes of head and neck cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2090669093,"Given the failure of chemo- and biotherapies to fight advanced pancreatic cancer, one major challenge is to identify critical events that initiate invasion. One priming step in epithelia carcinogenesis is the disruption of epithelial cell anchorage to the basement membrane which can be provided by hemidesmosomes (HDs). However, the existence of HDs in pancreatic ductal epithelium and their role in carcinogenesis remain unexplored. HDs have been explored in normal and cancer pancreatic cells, and patient samples. Unique cancer cell models where HD assembly can be pharmacologically manipulated by somatostatin/sst2 signaling have been then used to investigate the role and molecular mechanisms of dynamic HD during pancreatic carcinogenesis. We surprisingly report the presence of mature type-1 HDs comprising the integrin α6β4 and bullous pemphigoid antigen BP180 in the human pancreatic ductal epithelium. Importantly, HDs are shown to disassemble during pancreatic carcinogenesis. HD breakdown requires phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent induction of the matrix-metalloprotease MMP-9, which cleaves BP180. Consequently, integrin α6β4 delocalizes to the cell-leading edges where it paradoxically promotes cell migration and invasion through S100A4 activation. As S100A4 in turn stimulates MMP-9 expression, a vicious cycle maintains BP180 cleavage. Inactivation of this PI3K-MMP-9-S100A4 signaling loop conversely blocks BP180 cleavage, induces HD reassembly and inhibits cell invasion. We conclude that mature type-1 HDs are critical anchoring structures for the pancreatic ductal epithelium whose disruption, upon PI3K activation during carcinogenesis, provokes pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion."

Herein, we report that lithium inhibits cell proliferation, blocks G1/S cell-cycle progression, induces cell apoptosis and suppresses tumorigenic potential of PDA cells through down-regulation of the expression and activity of GLI1. Moreover, lithium synergistically enhances the anti-cancer effect of gemcitabine. These findings further our knowledge of mechanisms of action for lithium and provide a potentially new therapeutic strategy for PDA through targeting GLI1."
https://openalex.org/W1987256736,"Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that carries an extremely poor prognosis when local invasion, nodal spread or systemic metastasis has occurred. Recent advances in melanoma biology have revealed that RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling has a pivotal role in governing disease progression and treatment resistance. Proof-of-concept clinical studies have shown that direct BRAF inhibition yields impressive responses in advanced disease but these are short-lived as treatment resistance rapidly emerges. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop new targeted strategies for BRAF mutant melanoma. As such, oncolytic viruses represent a promising cancer-specific approach with significant activity in melanoma. This study investigated interactions between genetically-modified vaccinia virus (GLV-1h68) and radiotherapy in melanoma cell lines with BRAF mutant, Ras mutant or wild-type genotype. Preclinical studies revealed that GLV-1h68 combined with radiotherapy significantly increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis relative to either single agent in (V600D)BRAF/(V600E)BRAF mutant melanoma in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of enhanced cytotoxicity with GLV-1h68/radiation (RT) was independent of viral replication and due to attenuation of JNK, p38 and ERK MAPK phosphorylation specifically in BRAF mutant cells. Further studies showed that JNK pathway inhibition sensitized BRAF mutant cells to GLV-1h68-mediated cell death, mimicking the effect of RT. GLV-1h68 infection activated MAPK signaling in (V600D)BRAF/(V600E)BRAF mutant cell lines and this was associated with TNF-α secretion which, in turn, provided a prosurvival signal. Combination GLV-1h68/RT (or GLV-1h68/JNK inhibition) caused abrogation of TNF-α secretion. These data provide a strong rationale for combining GLV-1h68 with irradiation in (V600D/E)BRAF mutant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1988344527,PKA is retained within distinct subcellular environments by the association of its regulatory type II (RII) subunits with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Conventional reagents that universally disrupt PKA anchoring are patterned after a conserved AKAP motif. We introduce a phage selection procedure that exploits high-resolution structural information to engineer RII mutants that are selective for a particular AKAP. Selective RII (RSelect) sequences were obtained for eight AKAPs following competitive selection screening. Biochemical and cell-based experiments validated the efficacy of RSelect proteins for AKAP2 and AKAP18. These engineered proteins represent a new class of reagents that can be used to dissect the contributions of different AKAP-targeted pools of PKA. Molecular modeling and high-throughput sequencing analyses revealed the molecular basis of AKAP-selective interactions and shed new light on native RII-AKAP interactions. We propose that this structure-directed evolution strategy might be generally applicable for the investigation of other protein interaction surfaces.

This retrospective study investigated the prognostic value of the lymph node ratio (LNR) compared with the number of positive lymph nodes (pN) in Chinese breast cancer patients. Methods The medical records of female breast cancer patients (N = 2591) were retrospectively evaluated. The association of LNR and TMN staging system were compared with respect to overall, disease-free, and distant metastasis-free survival. Results Out of 2591 patients, 2495 underwent modified radical surgery and 96 received breast conserving surgery. All patients had adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery. The median follow up period 66.9 months (range 5–168 months). The 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates were 89.3% and 78.8%, respectively, and 5-year disease-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 81.6% and 83.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis indicated that in general T, pN, LNR, as well as tumor expression of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 were associated with overall, disease-free, and distant metastasis-free survival (all P-values <0.05). Mutlivariate analysis found pN stage and LNR were independent predictors of overall, disease-free, and distant metastasis-free survival (all P-values <0.001). If pN stage and LNR were both included in a multivariate analysis, LNR was still an independent prognostic factor for overall, disease-free, and distant metastasis-free survival (all P-values <0.001). Conclusion Our findings support the use of LNR as a predictor of survival in Chinese patients with breast cancer, and that LNR is superior to pN stage in determining disease prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W1983676868,"We report an inverse relationship between expression of the orphan candidate tumor suppressor gene esophageal cancer related gene 4 (Ecrg4), and the mucosal epithelial cell response to infection in the middle ear (ME). First, we found constitutive Ecrg4 mRNA expression in normal, quiescent ME mucosa that was confirmed by immunostainning of mucosal epithelial cells and immunoblotting of tissue lysates for the 14 kDa Ecrg4 protein. Upon experimental ME infection, Ecrg4 gene expression rapidly decreased by over 80%, between 3 to 48 hrs, post infection. When explants of this infected mucosa were placed in culture and transduced with an adenovirus (AD) encoding Ecrg4 gene (ADEcrg4), the proliferative and migratory responses of mucosal cells were significantly inhibited. ADEcrg4 transduction of control explants from uninfected MEs had no effect on basal growth and migration. Over-expression of Ecrg4 in vivo, by pre-injecting MEs with ADEcrg4 48 hrs prior to infection, prevented the natural down-regulation of Ecrg4, reduced mucosal proliferation and prevented inflammatory cell infiltration normally observed after infection. Taken together, these data support a hypothesis that Ecrg4 plays a role in coordinating the inflammatory and proliferative response to infection of mucosal epithelium suggesting a possible mechanism for its putative anti-tumor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1987697800,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a group of 34 FadD proteins that belong to the adenylate-forming superfamily. They are classified as either fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs) or fatty acyl-CoA ligases based on sequence analysis. FadD10, involved in the synthesis of a virulence-related lipopeptide, was mis-annotated as a fatty acyl-CoA ligase; however, it is in fact a FAAL that transfers fatty acids to an acyl carrier protein (Rv0100). In this study, we have determined the structures of FadD10 in both the apo-form and the complexed form with dodecanoyl-AMP, where we see for the first time an adenylate-forming enzyme that does not adopt a closed conformation for catalysis. Indeed, this novel conformation of FadD10, facilitated by its unique inter-domain and intermolecular interactions, is critical for the enzyme to carry out the acyl transfer onto Rv0100 rather than coenzyme A. This contradicts the existing model of FAALs that rely on an insertion motif for the acyltransferase specificity and thus makes FadD10 a new type of FAAL. We have also characterized the fatty acid preference of FadD10 through biological and structural analyses, and the data indicate long chain saturated fatty acids as the biological substrates of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2010371043,"Molecules that simultaneously inhibit independent or co-dependent proinflammatory pathways may have advantages over conventional monotherapeutics. OmCI is a bifunctional protein derived from blood-feeding ticks that specifically prevents complement (C)-mediated C5 activation and also sequesters leukotriene B4 (LTB4) within an internal binding pocket. Here, we examined the effect of LTB4 binding on OmCI structure and function and investigated the relative importance of C-mediated C5 activation and LTB4 in a mouse model of immune complex-induced acute lung injury (IC-ALI). We describe two crystal structures of bacterially expressed OmCI: one binding a C16 fatty acid and the other binding LTB4 (C20). We show that the C5 and LTB4 binding activities of the molecule are independent of each other and that OmCI is a potent inhibitor of experimental IC-ALI, equally dependent on both C5 inhibition and LTB4 binding for full activity. The data highlight the importance of LTB4 in IC-ALI and activation of C5 by the complement pathway C5 convertase rather than by non-C proteases. The findings suggest that dual inhibition of C5 and LTB4 may be useful for treatment of human immune complex-dependent diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2041191236,"Introduction In this study, 27 genetic polymorphisms that were previously reported to be associated with clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer patients were investigated in relation to overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) in colorectal cancer patients from Newfoundland. Methods The discovery and validation cohorts comprised of 532 and 252 patients, respectively. Genotypes of 27 polymorphisms were first obtained in the discovery cohort and survival analyses were performed assuming the co-dominant genetic model. Polymorphisms associated with disease outcomes in the discovery cohort were then investigated in the validation cohort. Results When adjusted for sex, age, tumor stage and microsatellite instability (MSI) status, four polymorphisms were independent predictors of OS in the discovery cohort MTHFR Glu429Ala (HR: 1.72, 95%CI: 1.04–2.84, p = 0.036), ERCC5 His46His (HR: 1.78, 95%CI: 1.15–2.76, p = 0.01), SERPINE1 −675indelG (HR: 0.52, 95%CI: 0.32–0.84, p = 0.008), and the homozygous deletion of GSTM1 gene (HR: 1.4, 95%CI: 1.03–1.92, p = 0.033). In the validation cohort, the MTHFR Glu429Ala polymorphism was associated with shorter OS (HR: 1.71, 95%CI: 1.18–2.49, p = 0.005), although with a different genotype than the discovery cohort (CC genotype in the discovery cohort and AC genotype in the validation cohort). When stratified based on treatment with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based regimens, this polymorphism was associated with reduced OS only in patients not treated with 5-FU. In the DFS analysis, when adjusted for other variables, the TT genotype of the ERCC5 His46His polymorphism was associated with shorter DFS in both cohorts (discovery cohort: HR: 1.54, 95%CI: 1.04–2.29, p = 0.032 and replication cohort: HR: 1.81, 95%CI: 1.11–2.94, p = 0.018). Conclusions In this study, associations of the MTHFR Glu429Ala polymorphism with OS and the ERCC5 His46His polymorphism with DFS were identified in two colorectal cancer patient cohorts. Our results also suggest that the MTHFR Glu429Ala polymorphism may be an adverse prognostic marker in patients not treated with 5-FU."
https://openalex.org/W2052227589,"NFAT (the nuclear factor of activated T cells) upregulation has been linked to cellular transformation intrinsically, but it is unclear whether and how tissue cells with NFAT activation change the local environment for tumor initiation and progression. Direct evidence showing NFAT activation initiates primary tumor formation in vivo is also lacking. Using inducible transgenic mouse systems, we show that tumors form in a subset of, but not all, tissues with NFATc1 activation, indicating that NFAT oncogenic effects depend on cell types and tissue contexts. In NFATc1-induced skin and ovarian tumors, both cells with NFATc1 activation and neighboring cells without NFATc1 activation have significant upregulation of c-Myc and activation of Stat3. Besides known and suspected NFATc1 targets, such as Spp1 and Osm, we have revealed the early upregulation of a number of cytokines and cytokine receptors, as key molecular components of an inflammatory microenvironment that promotes both NFATc1(+) and NFATc1(-) cells to participate in tumor formation. Cultured cells derived from NFATc1-induced tumors were able to establish a tumorigenic microenvironment, similar to that of the primary tumors, in an NFATc1-dependent manner in nude mice with T-cell deficiency, revealing an addiction of these tumors to NFATc1 activation and downplaying a role for T cells in the NFATc1-induced tumorigenic microenvironment. These findings collectively suggest that beyond the cell autonomous effects on the upregulation of oncogenic proteins, NFATc1 activation has non-cell autonomous effects through the establishment of a promitogenic microenvironment for tumor growth. This study provides direct evidence for the ability of NFATc1 in inducing primary tumor formation in vivo and supports targeting NFAT signaling in anti-tumor therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2022778678,"Twenty macropods from five locations in Queensland, Australia, grazing on a variety of native pastures were surveyed and the bacterial community of the foregut was examined using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing. Specifically, the V3/V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was examined. A total of 5040 OTUs were identified in the data set (post filtering). Thirty-two OTUs were identified as ‘shared’ OTUS (i.e. present in all samples) belonging to either Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes (Clostridiales/Bacteroidales). These phyla predominated the general microbial community in all macropods. Genera represented within the shared OTUs included: unclassified Ruminococcaceae, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, unclassified Clostridiales, Peptococcus sp. Coprococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Blautia sp., Ruminoccocus sp., Eubacterium sp., Dorea sp., Oscillospira sp. and Butyrivibrio sp. The composition of the bacterial community of the foregut samples of each the host species (Macropus rufus, Macropus giganteus and Macropus robustus) was significantly different allowing differentiation between the host species based on alpha and beta diversity measures. Specifically, eleven dominant OTUs that separated the three host species were identified and classified as: unclassified Ruminococcaceae, unclassified Bacteroidales, Prevotella spp. and a Syntrophococcus sucromutans. Putative reductive acetogens and fibrolytic bacteria were also identified in samples. Future work will investigate the presence and role of fibrolytics and acetogens in these ecosystems. Ideally, the isolation and characterization of these organisms will be used for enhanced feed efficiency in cattle, methane mitigation and potentially for other industries such as the biofuel industry."
https://openalex.org/W2070654180,"Background microRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in regulation of many cellular processes. miRNAs are processed to their mature functional form in a step-wise manner by multiple proteins and cofactors in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Many miRNAs are conserved across vertebrates. Mature miRNAs have recently been characterized in Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.). The aim of this study was to identify and characterize precursor miRNA (pre-miRNAs) and miRNA targets in this non-model flatfish. Discovery of miRNA precursor forms and targets in non-model organisms is difficult because of limited source information available. Therefore, we have developed a methodology to overcome this limitation. Methods Genomic DNA and small transcriptome of Atlantic halibut were sequenced using Roche 454 pyrosequencing and SOLiD next generation sequencing (NGS), respectively. Identified pre- miRNAs were further validated with reverse–transcription PCR. miRNA targets were identified using miRanda and RNAhybrid target prediction tools using sequences from public databases. Some of miRNA targets were also identified using RACE-PCR. miRNA binding sites were validated with luciferase assay using the RTS34st cell line. Results We obtained more than 1.3 M and 92 M sequence reads from 454 genomic DNA sequencing and SOLiD small RNA sequencing, respectively. We identified 34 known and 9 novel pre-miRNAs. We predicted a number of miRNA target genes involved in various biological pathways. miR-24 binding to kisspeptin 1 receptor-2 (kiss1-r2) was confirmed using luciferase assay. Conclusion This study demonstrates that identification of conserved and novel pre-miRNAs in a non-model vertebrate lacking substantial genomic resources can be performed by combining different next generation sequencing technologies. Our results indicate a wide conservation of miRNA precursors and involvement of miRNA in multiple regulatory pathways, and provide resources for further research on miRNA in non-model animals."
https://openalex.org/W1989718858,"Fire is a major disturbance process in many ecosystems world-wide, resulting in spatially and temporally dynamic landscapes. For populations occupying such environments, fire-induced landscape change is likely to influence population processes, and genetic patterns and structure among populations. The Mallee Emu-wren Stipiturus mallee is an endangered passerine whose global distribution is confined to fire-prone, semi-arid mallee shrublands in south-eastern Australia. This species, with poor capacity for dispersal, has undergone a precipitous reduction in distribution and numbers in recent decades. We used genetic analyses of 11 length-variable, nuclear loci to examine population structure and processes within this species, across its global range. Populations of the Mallee Emu-wren exhibited a low to moderate level of genetic diversity, and evidence of bottlenecks and genetic drift. Bayesian clustering methods revealed weak genetic population structure across the species' range. The direct effects of large fires, together with associated changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of suitable habitat, have the potential to cause population bottlenecks, serial local extinctions and subsequent recolonisation, all of which may interact to erode and homogenise genetic diversity in this species. Movement among temporally and spatially shifting habitat, appears to maintain long-term genetic connectivity. A plausible explanation for the observed genetic patterns is that, following extensive fires, recolonisation exceeds in-situ survival as the primary driver of population recovery in this species. These findings suggest that dynamic, fire-dominated landscapes can drive genetic homogenisation of populations of species with low-mobility and specialised habitat that otherwise would be expected to show strongly structured populations. Such effects must be considered when formulating management actions to conserve species in fire-prone systems."
https://openalex.org/W1986286357,"SPROUTY2 (SPRY2) is an intracellular regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling involved in cell growth, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Here, we show that SPRY2 is a target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway that is abnormally activated in more than 90% of colon carcinomas. In human colon cancer cells, SPRY2 expression is induced by β-catenin in co-operation with the transcription factor FOXO3a instead of lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor proteins. We found binding of β-catenin to the SPRY2 promoter at FOXO3a response elements. In vivo, cells marked by nuclear β-catenin and FOXO3a express SPRY2 in proliferative epithelial tissues, such as intestinal mucosa and epidermis. Consistently, inducible β-catenin deletion in mice reduced Spry2 expression in the small intestine. Moreover, SPRY2 protein expression correlated with nuclear β-catenin and FOXO3a colocalization in human colon carcinomas. Importantly, the amount of SPRY2 protein correlated with shorter overall survival of colon cancer patients. Our data reveal SPRY2 as a novel Wnt/β-catenin and FOXO3a target gene indicative of poor prognosis in colon cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2105876383,"Human scalp skin and hair follicles (HFs) are extra-pituitary sources of prolactin (PRL). However, the intracutaneous regulation of PRL remains poorly understood. Therefore we investigated whether well-recognized regulators of pituitary PRL expression, which also impact on human skin physiology and pathology, regulate expression of PRL and its receptor (PRLR) in situ. This was studied in serum-free organ cultures of microdissected human scalp HFs and skin, i.e. excluding pituitary, neural and vascular inputs. Prolactin expression was confirmed at the gene and protein level in human truncal skin, where its expression significantly increased (p = 0.049) during organ culture. There was, however, no evidence of PRL secretion into the culture medium as measured by ELISA. PRL immunoreactivity (IR) in female human epidermis was decreased by substance P (p = 0.009), while neither the classical pituitary PRL inhibitor, dopamine, nor corticotropin-releasing hormone significantly modulated PRL IR in HFs or skin respectively. Interferon (IFN) γ increased PRL IR in the epithelium of human HFs (p = 0.044) while tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α decreased both PRL and PRLR IR. This study identifies substance P, TNFα and IFNγ as novel modulators of PRL and PRLR expression in human skin, and suggests that intracutaneous PRL expression is not under dopaminergic control. Given the importance of PRL in human hair growth regulation and its possible role in the pathogenesis of several common skin diseases, targeting intracutaneous PRL production via these newly identified regulatory pathways may point towards novel therapeutic options for inflammatory dermatoses."

Our approach is based on the assumption that, if a mutation in a gene [Formula: see text] leads to a phenotypic abnormality in a process [Formula: see text], then [Formula: see text] must have been involved in [Formula: see text], either directly or indirectly. We systematically analyze recorded phenotypes in animal models using the formal definitions created for phenotype ontologies. We evaluate the validity of the inferred functions manually and by demonstrating a significant improvement in predicting genetic interactions and protein-protein interactions based on functional similarity.

https://openalex.org/W2062592181,"The genes encoding the ribosomal proteins of fungi form a regulon whose expression is enhanced under good growth conditions and down-regulated under starvation conditions. The fungal pathogen Candida albicans contains an evolutionarily ancient control circuit for this regulon where a heteromer made up of the transcription regulators Ifh1 (interacts with Forkhead 1) and Fhl1 (Forkhead-like 1) is targeted to the ribosomal protein genes by the DNA binding factor Tbf1. In the more recently evolved circuit in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc), the generalist repressor-activator protein Rap1 now directs the Ifh1-Fhl1 module to the ribosomal protein genes. Even though overall sequence similarity is low for the respective Fhl1 and Ifh1 subunits, in both species, the Ifh1 protein links to the Forkhead-associated domain of Fhl1 through its FHB domain. Intriguingly, correlated with the transition to the Rap1-regulated circuit, the Sc-Ifh1 contains a Rap1 binding domain that is not present in the C. albicans protein. Because no extensive common sequences are found in Tbf1 and Rap1, it appears that these targeting proteins must connect to the Ifh1-Fhl1 module in distinct ways. Two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analysis has been used to show that in C. albicans Tbf1 is linked to the heterodimer through direct association with Fhl1. By contrast, in S. cerevisiae, the linkage of the heteromer to Rap1 occurs through Ifh1. Thus, in the ascomycetes, the Ifh1-Fhl1 heterodimer has reconfigured its protein associations to remain connected to the ribosomal protein regulon despite rewiring of the targeting transcription factor from Tbf1 to Rap1."
https://openalex.org/W2030373962,"The role of the disaccharide trehalose, its biosynthesis pathways and their regulation in Archaea are still ambiguous. In Thermoproteus tenax a fused trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase (TPSP), consisting of an N-terminal trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and a C-terminal trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) domain, was identified. The tpsp gene is organized in an operon with a putative glycosyltransferase (GT) and a putative mechanosensitive channel (MSC). The T. tenax TPSP exhibits high phosphatase activity, but requires activation by the co-expressed GT for bifunctional synthase-phosphatase activity. The GT mediated activation of TPS activity relies on the fusion of both, TPS and TPP domain, in the TPSP enzyme. Activation is mediated by complex-formation in vivo as indicated by yeast two-hybrid and crude extract analysis. In combination with first evidence for MSC activity the results suggest a sophisticated stress response involving TPSP, GT and MSC in T. tenax and probably in other Thermoproteales species. The monophyletic prokaryotic TPSP proteins likely originated via a single fusion event in the Bacteroidetes with subsequent horizontal gene transfers to other Bacteria and Archaea. Furthermore, evidence for the origin of eukaryotic TPSP fusions via HGT from prokaryotes and therefore a monophyletic origin of eukaryotic and prokaryotic fused TPSPs is presented. This is the first report of a prokaryotic, archaeal trehalose synthase complex exhibiting a much more simple composition than the eukaryotic complex described in yeast. Thus, complex formation and a complex-associated regulatory potential might represent a more general feature of trehalose synthesizing proteins."

However, how they interact at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) and there determine whether the cell will live or be sentenced to death remains unknown. Competing models have been presented that describe how Bcl-2 inhibits the cell-killing activity of Bax, which is common in treatment-resistant tumors where Bcl-2 is overexpressed. Some studies suggest that Bcl-2 binds directly to and sequesters Bax, while others suggest an indirect process whereby Bcl-2 blocks BH3-only proteins and prevents them from activating Bax. Here we present the results of a biophysical study in which we investigated the putative interaction of solubilized full-length human Bcl-2 with Bax and the scope for incorporating the former into a native-like lipid environment. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to detect direct Bcl-2-Bax-interactions in the presence of polyoxyethylene-(23)-lauryl-ether (Brij-35) detergent at a level below its critical micelle concentration (CMC). Additional surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements confirmed this observation and revealed a high affinity between the Bax and Bcl-2 proteins. Upon formation of this protein-protein complex, Bax also prevented the binding of antimycin A2 (a known inhibitory ligand of Bcl-2) to the Bcl-2 protein, as fluorescence spectroscopy experiments showed. In addition, Bcl-2 was able to form mixed micelles with Triton X-100 solubilized neutral phospholipids in the presence of high concentrations of Brij-35 (above its CMC). Following detergent removal, the integral membrane protein was found to have been fully reconstituted into a native-like membrane environment, as confirmed by ultracentrifugation and subsequent SDS-PAGE experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1983004468,"TLR2 specifically recognizes a wide range of ligands by homodimerizing or heterodimerizing with TLR1 or TLR6. However, the molecular basis of the specific signalling transduction induced by TLR2 homodimerization or heterodimerization with TLR1 or TLR6 is largely unknown. In this study, we found three amino acid residues, two (663L and 688N) outside and one (681P) inside the BB loop, which were conserved in all of the TLRs, except for the TLR3 toll/IL-1R(TIR) domain. The responsiveness of human TLR2/2, TLR2/1 or TLR2/6 was completely lost when 663L and 688N were replaced with the corresponding amino acid residues in the TLR3 TIR domain, respectively. However, the response of TLR2 (P681A) to the high concentration of TLR2/TLR6 agonist was almost intact, but the activity of TLR2 (P681A) was greatly reduced when stimulated with the TLR2/1 agonist or the TLR2/2 agonist. Although the surface expression of TLR2 (L663E) was sharply reduced, both the intracellular distribution and the surface expression of all of the other TLR2 mutants were unchanged. The ability of all three TLR2 mutants to recruit MyD88, was consistent with their responsivenesses. Computer modelling indicated that the surface negative charge of all of the TLR2 mutants' BB loops was reduced. Thus, our data demonstrated that the 663L and 688N residues outside of the BB loop were essential for the responsiveness of TLR2/2, TLR2/1 and TLR2/6, but the 681P residue inside of the BB loop exhibited divergent roles in TLR2/2, TLR2/1 and TLR2/6 signalling transduction, thereby providing clues regarding the specific signalling transduction of TLR2/2, TLR2/1 and TLR2/6."
https://openalex.org/W2087209869,"Avian influenza subtypes such as H5, H7 and H9 are yet to adapt to the human host so as to establish airborne transmission between humans. However, lab-generated reassorted viruses possessing hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from an avian H9 isolate and other genes from a human-adapted (H3 or H1) subtype acquired two amino acid changes in HA and a single amino acid change in NA that confer respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets. We previously demonstrated for human-adapted H1, H2 and H3 subtypes that quantitative binding affinity of their HA to α2→6 sialylated glycan receptors correlates with respiratory droplet transmissibility of the virus in ferrets. Such a relationship remains to be established for H9 HA. In this study, we performed a quantitative biochemical characterization of glycan receptor binding properties of wild-type and mutant forms of representative H9 HAs that were previously used in context of reassorted viruses in ferret transmission studies. We demonstrate here that distinct molecular interactions in the glycan receptor-binding site of different H9 HAs affect the glycan-binding specificity and affinity. Further we show that α2→6 glycan receptor-binding affinity of a mutant H9 HA carrying Thr-189→Ala amino acid change correlates with the respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets conferred by this change. Our findings contribute to a framework for monitoring the evolution of H9 HA by understanding effects of molecular changes in HA on glycan receptor-binding properties."
https://openalex.org/W2001073662,"This study presents a novel approach to aid in diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs). A real-time PCR assay was used to screen for culture-positive urinary specimens and to identify the causative uropathogen. Semi-quantitative breakpoints were used to screen for significant bacteriuria (presence of ≥ 10(5) CFU/ml of uropathogens) or low-level bacteriuria (containing between 10(3) and 10(4) CFU/ml of uropathogens). The 16S rDNA-based assay could identify the most prevalent uropathogens using probes for Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species and Streptococcus species. 330 urinary specimens were analysed and results were compared with conventional urine culture. Using a PCR Ct value of 25 as semi-quantitative breakpoint for significant bacteriuria resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 80%, respectively. In 78% of the samples with monomicrobial infections the assay contained probes to detect the bacteria present in the urine specimens and 99% of these uropathogens was correctly identified. Concluding, this proof-of-concept approach demonstrates that the assay can distinguish bacteriuria from no bacteriuria as well as detect the involved uropathogen within 4 hours after sampling, allowing adequate therapy decisions within the same day as well as drastically reduce consequent urine culturing."
https://openalex.org/W2118733697,"Backgrounds Despite continuing progress in X-ray crystallography and high-field NMR spectroscopy for determination of three-dimensional protein structures, the number of unsolved and newly discovered sequences grows much faster than that of determined structures. Protein modeling methods can possibly bridge this huge sequence-structure gap with the development of computational science. A grand challenging problem is to predict three-dimensional protein structure from its primary structure (residues sequence) alone. However, predicting residue contact maps is a crucial and promising intermediate step towards final three-dimensional structure prediction. Better predictions of local and non-local contacts between residues can transform protein sequence alignment to structure alignment, which can finally improve template based three-dimensional protein structure predictors greatly. Methods CNNcon, an improved multiple neural networks based contact map predictor using six sub-networks and one final cascade-network, was developed in this paper. Both the sub-networks and the final cascade-network were trained and tested with their corresponding data sets. While for testing, the target protein was first coded and then input to its corresponding sub-networks for prediction. After that, the intermediate results were input to the cascade-network to finish the final prediction. Results The CNNcon can accurately predict 58.86% in average of contacts at a distance cutoff of 8 Å for proteins with lengths ranging from 51 to 450. The comparison results show that the present method performs better than the compared state-of-the-art predictors. Particularly, the prediction accuracy keeps steady with the increase of protein sequence length. It indicates that the CNNcon overcomes the thin density problem, with which other current predictors have trouble. This advantage makes the method valuable to the prediction of long length proteins. As a result, the effective prediction of long length proteins could be possible by the CNNcon."
https://openalex.org/W2055357498,"Eps8 is involved in both cell signalling and receptor trafficking. It is a known phosphorylation substrate for two proteins involved in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway: the receptor itself and Src. Here we report a differential proteomic analysis of Eps8 aimed to identify specific FGFR and Src family kinase dependent phosphosites and co-associated phosphodependent binding partners. This study reveals a total of 22 Eps8 pTyr and pSer/Thr phosphorylation sites, including those that are dependent on Src family and FGFR kinase activity. Peptide affinity purification of proteins that bind to a selection of the pTyr phosphosites has identified a range of novel Eps8 binding partners including members of the intracellular vesicle trafficking machinery (clathrin and AP-2), proteins which have been shown to regulate activated receptor trafficking (NBR1 and Vav2), and proteins involved in receptor signalling (IRS4 and Shp2). Collectively this study significantly extends the understanding of Eps8 post-translational modification by regulated phosphorylation, identifies novel Eps8 binding partners implicated in receptor trafficking and signalling, and confirms the functions of Eps8 at the nexus of receptor signalling and vesicular trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1965191255,"Maintaining activity of enzymes tethered to solid interfaces remains a major challenge in developing hybrid organic-inorganic devices. In nature, mammalian spermatozoa have overcome this design challenge by having glycolytic enzymes with specialized targeting domains that enable them to function while tethered to a cytoskeletal element. As a step toward designing a hybrid organic-inorganic ATP-generating system, we implemented a biomimetic site-specific immobilization strategy to tether two glycolytic enzymes representing different functional enzyme families: triose phosphoisomerase (TPI; an isomerase) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDHS; an oxidoreductase). We then evaluated the activities of these enzymes in comparison to when they were tethered via classical carboxyl-amine crosslinking. Both enzymes show similar surface binding regardless of immobilization method. Remarkably, specific activities for both enzymes were significantly higher when tethered using the biomimetic, site-specific immobilization approach. Using this biomimetic approach, we tethered both enzymes to a single surface and demonstrated their function in series in both forward and reverse directions. Again, the activities in series were significantly higher in both directions when the enzymes were coupled using this biomimetic approach versus carboxyl-amine binding. Our results suggest that biomimetic, site-specific immobilization can provide important functional advantages over chemically specific, but non-oriented attachment, an important strategic insight given the growing interest in recapitulating entire biological pathways on hybrid organic-inorganic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2001131809,"Background Stretch is a mechanical parameter, which has been proposed previously to affect the biological activities in different tissues. This study explored its utility in determining plaque vulnerability. Methods One hundred and six patients with mild to moderate carotid stenosis were recruited in this study (53 symptomatic and 53 asymptomatic). High resolution, multi-sequence magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed to delineate various plaque components. Finite element method was used to predict high stretch concentration within the plaque. Results During a two-year follow-up, 11 patients in symptomatic group and 3 in asymptomatic group experienced recurrent cerebrovascular events. Plaque stretch at systole and stretch variation during one cardiac cycle was greater in symptomatic group than those in the asymptomatic. Within the symptomatic group, a similar trend was observed in patients with recurrent events compared to those without. Conclusion Plaques with high stretch concentration and large stretch variation are associated with increased risk of future cerebrovascular events."
https://openalex.org/W1967125417,"The SCID-beige/Alb-uPA mouse model is currently the best small animal model available for viral hepatitis infection studies [1]. But the construction procedure is often costly and time-consuming due to logistic and technical difficulties. Thus, the widespread application of these chimeric mice has been hampered [2]. In order to optimize the procedure, we constructed a single lentiviral vector containing modified tetracycline-regulated system to control Alb-uPA gene expression in the cultured hepatocytes. The modified albumin promoter controlled by tetracycline (Tet)-dependent transactivator rtTA2S-M2 was integrated into a lentiviral vector. The full-length uPA cDNA was inserted into another lentiviral vector containing PTight, a modified Tet-responsive promoter. Two vectors were then digested by specific enzymes and ligated by DNA ligase 4. The ligated DNA fragment was inserted into a modified pLKO.1 cloning vector and the final lentiviral vector was then successfully constructed. H2.35 cell, Lewis lung carcinoma, primary kidney, primary hepatic interstitial and CT26 cells were infected with recombinant lentivirus at selected MOI. The expression of uPA induced by DOX was detectable only in the infected H2.35 cells, which was confirmed by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Moreover, DOX induced uPA expression on the infected H2.35 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The constructed single lentiviral vector has many biological advantages, including that the interested gene expression under “Tet-on/off” system is controlled by DOX in a dose-depending fashion only in murine liver cells, which provides an advantage for simplifying generation of conditional transgenic animals."
https://openalex.org/W2048160974,"Inhibitory antibodies directed against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) can be found in patients with acquired and congenital hemophilia A. Such FVIII-inhibiting antibodies are routinely detected by the functional Bethesda Assay. However, this assay has a low sensitivity and shows a high inter-laboratory variability. Another method to detect antibodies recognizing FVIII is ELISA, but this test does not allow the distinction between inhibitory and non-inhibitory antibodies. Therefore, we aimed at replacing the intricate antigen FVIII by Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) mimicking the epitopes of FVIII inhibitors. As a model we used the well-described inhibitory human monoclonal anti-FVIII antibody, Bo2C11, for the selection on DARPin libraries. Two DARPins were selected binding to the antigen-binding site of Bo2C11, which mimic thus a functional epitope on FVIII. These DARPins inhibited the binding of the antibody to its antigen and restored FVIII activity as determined in the Bethesda assay. Furthermore, the specific DARPins were able to recognize the target antibody in human plasma and could therefore be used to test for the presence of Bo2C11-like antibodies in a large set of hemophilia A patients. These data suggest, that our approach might be used to isolate epitopes from different sets of anti-FVIII antibodies in order to develop an ELISA-based screening assay allowing the distinction of inhibitory and non-inhibitory anti-FVIII antibodies according to their antibody signatures."

Gene expression profiling allows for the simultaneous measurement of expression levels for thousands of genes and the opportunity to use this information to increase biological understanding. Yet, the best way to relate this immense amount of information to biological outcomes is far from clear. Here, a novel approach to gene expression systems research is presented that focuses on understanding gene expression systems at the level of gene expression program regulation. It is suggested that such an approach has important advantages over current techniques and may provide novel insights into how gene expression systems are regulated to shape biological outcomes such as the development of disease or response to treatment."
