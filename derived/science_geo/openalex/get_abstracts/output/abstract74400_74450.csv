https://openalex.org/W2012146599,"THE genesis of rheumatic valvular disease in man has been difficult to establish owing to the scarcity of human material in the early stages and the absence of any comparable condition in experimental animals. On the evidence at present available it has been stated that the calcific lesions found in human rheumatic valvular disease are unlikely to be the direct result of the rheumatic process in the valve cusps1. In recent experiments we have been studying the effects of papillary muscle damage and inactivation on the function of the mitral valve and the left ventricle of the dog2. In these experiments either the anterior or the posterior papillary muscle was injected with 0.5–1.0 ml. ethanol and the animal allowed to recover. A surprising finding was that when the animals were killed three months later, four out of twelve dogs in addition to papillary muscle damage also had fibrotic, calcific or chondrific lesions of the mitral valve cusps (Fig. 1). In all four animals the valvular lesion was in the segment of the aortic cusp of the mitral valve which was attached to the damaged papillary muscle and there was no continuity of the valvular lesions with either the papillary muscle lesion through the chordae tendinae or the atriotomy scar in the three animals in which this had been carried out. In ten dogs used as controls in which the ethanol injection was made into the lateral wall of the left ventricle between the papillary muscles, no valvular lesions were found. Histological examination of the lesions showed a fibrous plaque on the atrial surface of the valve cusp with replacement by calcification and chondrification (Fig. 2). There was no evidence of an infective lesion."

https://openalex.org/W1972073655,"ON surveying the literature pertaining to this subject, it was found that workers in the Eastern European countries1 maintain that the use of convalescent serum in burnt patients is of considerable therapeutic value due to a hypothetical antibody to burnt skin2. Workers in the Western world3–7 in the same field have been unable as yet to prove the existence of such an immunological mechanism and have claimed that any antibody demonstrated so far has been one produced by bacteria, thus not specific to burnt tissue."

They reported that the major metabolite 3,4-di-hydroxypyridine (DHP) was present in the urine, and that degradation of mimosine to DHP occurred in the rumen, the animal being unable to detoxicate the material after absorption. No comparable work on the fowl has been located in the literature."

https://openalex.org/W2067011241,"THE classification of Candida albicans into two serological groups on the basis of agglutination tests was first reported by Hasenclever and Mitchell1, and both in the original and subsequent papers2–4 these authors and their colleagues referred to group A and group B strains. The findings were confirmed by me5,6 using a double-diffusion method, and, for the sake of conformity, similarly using the word ‘group’ with reference to the serological division within the species. Nevertheless, it must be apparent that this terminology is not consistent with that relating to the serological classification of other microbiological species such as Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae, where the word ‘type’ is employed, and that confusion may arise if the word ‘group’ is used to describe not only an antigen (group antigen) which is common to more than one species of a particular genus, but also the serological division within a species."

https://openalex.org/W2006127703,"THE thymus and the bursa of Fabricius are both essential for the development of immunological competence in birds. The bursa of Fabricius seems to be responsible for the development of the cells producing serum antibodies1 and delayed hypersensitivity reactions2, whereas the thymus is more particularly involved in homograft reactions3,4. The fact that the thymus shows evidence of at least partial activity when implanted in a ‘Millipore’ chamber impermeable to cells5 suggests that its influence is humoral."

While its significance in maintaining form is obvious, little is known of its possible role in physiological processes. Discovering functions of collagen would be of particular importance in regard to ageing. Physical properties of collagen change markedly with age, presumably because of increased cross-linkages, but these changes have not been related to the decrease in efficiency of physiological processes characteristic of ageing. The changes in collagen with age and their possible significance have recently been reviewed1."

https://openalex.org/W2030597964,"ABSORPTION of serum at 15° C with zymosan renders the serum deficient in properdin and destroys the capacity of such RP serum to haemolyse paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria erythrocytes (PNHE)1. Absorption of serum with zymosan at 0° C does not remove properdin, but does remove a zymosan specific fraction (‘0° factor’), so that on incubation with fresh zymosan at 15° C properdin is no longer affected2. Recent work in this laboratory has defined the PNHE haemolytic system as one dependent on fluid phase complement (C′) activation resulting in red cell membrane destruction as a result of direct attack by C′3 sub-components3. C′l esterase or C′l activators have been shown to enhance PNHE lysis and in addition certain C′l activators such as polyinosinic acid (poly I) may initiate the haemolysis of normal human erythrocytes (NHE), presumably by similar fluid phase complement reactions4. Thrombin has also been shown to enhance PNHE lysis, but the mechanism of this enhancement has been the subject of considerable controversy. The observations shown in Table 1 were designed to assess the relative role of properdin and ‘0° factor’ in native and poly I enhanced PNHE lysis, and to compare the stimulating effect of poly I on PNHE haemolysis with the ability of thrombin (‘Thrombin’, bovine, Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich.), both absorbed with NHE and unabsorbed, to enhance PNHE lysis."
