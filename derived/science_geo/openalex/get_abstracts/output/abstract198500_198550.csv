https://openalex.org/W1994373791,"DURING a study of bacterial decomposition of various chloro-substituted organic acids1 it was observed that certain strains of Trichoderma viride produced small amounts of chloride in synthetic medium with sodium monochloroacetate as sole organic constituent. Extra addition of yeast or soil extract had little effect; but later experiments showed that the fungi became very active when glucose was supplied as an additional carbon source. Ten strains of T. viride were tested in liquid medium containing 0.04 M sodium monochloroacetate, 0.2 per cent glucose, 0.05 per cent ammonium sulphate and dipotassium phosphate, 0.02 per cent magnesium sulphate and calcium sulphate, and 0.005 per cent ferrous sulphate. Cultures were incubated at 25° C., and chloride was determined by titration with 0.01 N silver nitrate, in the presence of potassium chromate as an indicator. The strains proved to comprise two groups, each of five strains. One of these groups (I) was strongly and the other (II) weakly active towards monochloroacetate. In addition, dichloroacetate was decomposed with moderate vigour, but α-monochloropropionate only feebly (Table 1)."

https://openalex.org/W2088321144,"IT is generally accepted that histamine plays an important part in anaphylactic shock. In recent years, attention has been directed to 5-hydroxytryptamine, since this substance, together with histamine, is liberated from the platelets by the antigen–antibody reaction1. Further, 5-hydroxytryptamine causes a shock syndrome in guinea pigs which is similar to that caused by anaphylaxis2. Although Herxheimer was unable to protect guinea pigs from anaphylactic shock using lysergic acid diethylamide, a potent and specific antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine, Pallotta and Ward3 have observed significant protection using intravenous doses of lysergic acid diethylamide."

These are exudative diathesis in the chick (Stokstad, E. L. R., private communication) and necrotic liver degeneration in the rat1. Factor III, an unidentified substance in addition to vitamin E and cystine having protective activity against liver necrosis, has been identified as selenium. These reports pose the question whether selenium may have tocopherol-replacing properties with respect to muscular dystrophy, the classical symptom of vitamin E deficiency in the young of most species."

https://openalex.org/W2068621535,"H. W. Dean and E. W. Dempsey1 found prominent deposits of acid phosphatase in the Golgi region of the duodenal epithelium in the rat, mouse, deer mouse, hamster, cat and monkey. They also recorded the presence of well-defined concentrations of acid phosphatase in the Golgi zone of the uterine epithelium of the pregnant cat and sow. These two authors also observed granular deposits of the same enzyme in the Golgi region and in the apical cytoplasm of cells from the liver and kidney of sundry species."

In cases where the antibody content of an immune serum is high, the conventional means of recording the titre may be misleading ; that is, the difference between a titre of 1 : 10,240 and 1 : 20,480 seemingly is greater than that between 1 : 40 and 1 : 80 but both represent only a single dilution step in the usual procedure and have the same degree of precision. Since serological procedures usually involve serial twofold dilutions, the resulting titres are exponential functions of 2. Consequently, we suggest the simple expedient of using logarithms to the base 2 (log2) to express serological titration data."

https://openalex.org/W2024955436,"Leptospira pomona is widely distributed in New Zealand, and outbreaks of leptospirosis among farm animals cause considerable economic loss to the livestock industry. While it is generally accepted that the domestic pig is the normal reservoir of infection it is rarely possible to inculpate the pig directly in ovine outbreaks of leptospirosis, and many outbreaks also occur on dairy farms on which no pigs are kept."

https://openalex.org/W2028768941,"IN the measurements of the molecular weight from light scattering and of other physical properties of deoxyribonucleic acid, an extraordinary variety of results has been obtained1, even with samples prepared from a single source, namely, calf thymus. To some extent this might be accounted for as a result of fractionation of the material resulting from its physical heterogeneity, which has been demonstrated by Shooter and Butler2, and by Schachman et al. 3. It may also arise from small amounts of protein impurity, which have been shown4 to affect the physical properties to a marked extent. In order to reduce the sources of discrepancy, it has been thought desirable to determine (1) light scattering, (2) intrinsic viscosity, (3) sedimentation coefficients, on identical solutions of calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid treated in various ways. It has been found that centrifuging as a means of clarifying the solutions is made much more effective by reducing the concentration from 0.1 to 0.04 per cent. Table 1 shows the effect of centrifuging for 18 hr. at 20,000g at these two concentrations. The difference must be due to the greater viscosity of the stronger solution. The light-scattering molecular weight, especially of the more turbid samples, is markedly reduced by centrifuging in this way at the lower concentration, without any great change of either the intrinsic viscosity or of the sedimentation coefficients. This must mean that the component which gives rise to high turbidities in the unclarified solutions does not contribute appreciably to the viscosity and sedimentation coefficient. That the high turbidities of the unclarified solutions is not due to deoxyribonucleic acid has been demonstrated by the fact that the action of deoxyribonuclease on a clarified solution (J40) with molecular weight 4×106 reduced the light scattering to 20 per cent of its original value ; while on a turbid solution (J38), having an apparent molecular weight of 17×106, the light scattering value was reduced by only 40 per cent, that is, to 10×106."

https://openalex.org/W2034427411,"ATTENTION has been directed by Schmahl and Schneider1 and Druckrey and Schmahl2 to the decrease in intensity of fluorescence which occurs when a benzene solution of fresh cigarette smoke products is exposed to light. This decrease in fluorescence indicates one obvious difference between the smoke, which will contain unchanged products when inhaled by the smoker, and any solution of the smoke products which has been exposed to light and which is then used for chemical or biological tests."

https://openalex.org/W2021171373,"IT was shown1 that the growth in width of the abdomen of the female pea crab, Pinnotheres pisum, did not show simple allometry2, but a continuously variable allometric relation, relative to carapace width. For purely empirical purposes a general polynomial relation was fitted to the two measurements3, but the quadratic proved a very good ‘fit’ and it was later pointed out (Reeve, E. C. R., personal communication) that no appreciable improvement was effected by fitting higher powers of the polynomial. It is possible, therefore, that the relation between abdomen-width (y) and carapace-width (x) may be defined, not only adequately but also significantly, by the simple equation y=a + bx + cx2, where a, b, c are constants for any particular abdominal segment, and are parameters for the abdomen as a whole3."

https://openalex.org/W1973476089,A WELL-KNOWN difficulty in using rocking microtomes for ultra-thin sectioning is the tendency for the cut section to be picked up on the return stroke. A number of mechanical devices have been described1 which attempt to overcome this. The device described here is a non-mechanical and exceedingly simple but effective aid to serial sectioning.

https://openalex.org/W2052641294,"IN the field of experimental embryology, carbon marking has been widely used for tracing the movements of cells1. By this method blood carbon particles adhering to the end of a needle are deposited among the cells the migrations of which are to be studied. When experiments are carried out in ovo, the needle, before it reaches the embryo, must first pass through the overlying layer of saline, albumen, etc., and the surface-tension effects here, as the needle reaches the surface of this fluid, cause the removal of all the particles not adherent to its very tip. To minimize this effect, it is essential that the needle be held perpendicular, and that a quick stabbing movement be used."
