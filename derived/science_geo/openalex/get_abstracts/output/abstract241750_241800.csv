https://openalex.org/W2053867514,"Genes involved in fatty acid catabolism have undergone extensive duplication in the genus Mycobacterium, which includes the etiologic agents of leprosy and tuberculosis. Here, we show that prokaryotic- and eukaryotic-like isoforms of the glyoxylate cycle enzyme isocitrate lyase (ICL) are jointly required for fatty acid catabolism and virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although deletion of icl1 or icl2, the genes that encode ICL1 and ICL2, respectively, had little effect on bacterial growth in macrophages and mice, deletion of both genes resulted in complete impairment of intracellular replication and rapid elimination from the lungs. The feasibility of targeting ICL1 and ICL2 for chemical inhibition was shown using a dual-specific ICL inhibitor, which blocked growth of M. tuberculosis on fatty acids and in macrophages. The absence of ICL orthologs in mammals should facilitate the development of glyoxylate cycle inhibitors as new drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis."

https://openalex.org/W2124338693,"In plants, systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is established as a result of NPR1-regulated expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Using gene expression profiling in Arabidopsis, we found that in addition to controlling the expression of PR genes, NPR1 also directly controls the expression of the protein secretory pathway genes. Up-regulation of these genes is essential for SAR, because mutations in some of them diminished the secretion of PR proteins (for example, PR1), resulting in reduced resistance. We provide evidence that NPR1 coordinately regulates these secretion-related genes through a previously undescribed cis-element. Activation of this cis-element is controlled by a transcription factor that is translocated into the nucleus upon SAR induction."

https://openalex.org/W2049734059,"The human left and right cerebral hemispheres are anatomically and functionally asymmetric. To test whether human cortical asymmetry has a molecular basis, we studied gene expression levels between the left and right embryonic hemispheres using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). We identified and verified 27 differentially expressed genes, which suggests that human cortical asymmetry is accompanied by early, marked transcriptional asymmetries. LMO4 is consistently more highly expressed in the right perisylvian human cerebral cortex than in the left and is essential for cortical development in mice, suggesting that human left-right specialization reflects asymmetric cortical development at early stages."
https://openalex.org/W2102059477,"Temperatures obtained from early Cassini infrared observations of Titan show a stratopause at an altitude of 310 kilometers (and 186 kelvin at 15 degrees S). Stratospheric temperatures are coldest in the winter northern hemisphere, with zonal winds reaching 160 meters per second. The concentrations of several stratospheric organic compounds are enhanced at mid- and high northern latitudes, and the strong zonal winds may inhibit mixing between these latitudes and the rest of Titan. Above the south pole, temperatures in the stratosphere are 4 to 5 kelvin cooler than at the equator. The stratospheric mole fractions of methane and carbon monoxide are (1.6 +/- 0.5) x 10(-2) and (4.5 +/- 1.5) x 10(-5), respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2023120221,"The fossil record of fungi and lichens is scarce. Here we report the discovery of lichen-like fossils, involving filamentous hyphae closely associated with coccoidal cyanobacteria or algae, preserved in marine phosphorite of the Doushantuo Formation (between 551 and 635 million years old) at Weng'an, South China. These fossils indicate that fungi developed symbiotic partnerships with photoautotrophs before the evolution of vascular plants."
https://openalex.org/W1968272864,"Tunneling electrons from a low-temperature (5 kelvin) scanning tunneling microscope were used to control, through resonant electronic excitation, the molecular dynamics of an individual biphenyl molecule adsorbed on a silicon(100) surface. Different reversible molecular movements were selectively activated by tuning the electron energy and by selecting precise locations for the excitation inside the molecule. Both the spatial selectivity and energy dependence of the electronic control are supported by spectroscopic measurements with the scanning tunneling microscope. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of controlling the molecular dynamics of a single molecule through the localization of the electronic excitation inside the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2171494808,"Endocannabinoids and cannabinoid CB1 receptors play a role in the control of movement by modulating GABA, glutamate, and other neurotransmitters throughout the basal ganglia. Roles for abnormalities in endocannabinoid signaling in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the major side effect of current treatments, levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), have been suggested by rodent studies. Here we show that signaling by endocannabinoids contributes to the pathophysiology of parkinsonism and LID in MPTP-lesioned, non-human primate models of Parkinson's disease. In MPTP-lesioned marmosets previously treated with levodopa to establish LID, attenuation of CB1 signaling by systemic administration of rimonabant (1 and 3 mg/kg) had anti-parkinsonian actions, equivalent to a 71% increase in motor activity at 3 mg/kg. Rimonabant did not elicit dyskinesia. Co-administration of levodopa (8 mg/kg) and rimonabant (1 and 3 mg/kg) resulted in significantly less dyskinesia than levodopa alone, without significantly affecting the anti-parkinsonian action of levodopa. These data suggest that enhanced endocannabinoid signaling may be involved in the pathophysiology of both parkinsonism and LID. To define potential mechanisms by which such a role might be mediated, we determined the levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) throughout the basal ganglia in normal and three groups of MPTP-lesioned cynomolgus monkeys (untreated; acutely treated with L-DOPA, non-dyskinetic; long-term treated, with levodopa-induced dyskinesia). In the untreated, MPTP-lesioned primate, parkinsonism was associated with increases in both 2-AG (+88%) and anandamide (+49%) in the striatum, and of 2-AG (+97%) in the substantia nigra, changes that are consistent with the previously suggested role for endocannabinoids in mechanisms attempting to compensate for loss of dopamine in untreated parkinsonism. Increased levels of anandamide (+34%) in the external globus pallidus of MPTP-lesioned animals were normalized by levodopa treatment and may contribute to the generation of parkinsonian symptoms. However, no clear alteration in endocannabinoid levels could be correlated with the expression of LID. These data highlight the potential roles played by endocannabinoids and CB1 in PD and LID and suggest the need for further research to pursue the multiple therapeutic opportunities for manipulating this system in movement disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2111509003,"The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) Langmuir probe (LP) sensor observed the cold plasma environment around Titan during the first two flybys. The data show that conditions in Saturn's magnetosphere affect the structure and dynamics deep in the ionosphere of Titan. The maximum measured ionospheric electron number density reached 3800 per cubic centimeter near closest approach, and a complex chemistry was indicated. The electron temperature profiles are consistent with electron heat conduction from the hotter Titan wake. The ionospheric escape flux was estimated to be 10 25 ions per second."
https://openalex.org/W2038871885,"The chemical dynamics of marine dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), a reservoir featuring surface accumulations even in areas where nitrogen limits productivity, have yet to be resolved. We exploited differences in the acid lability of amide bonds within high-molecular-weight (HMW) DON to show that vertical DON profiles result in part from the presence of two chemically distinct pools of amide. Half of HMWDON in surface waters is present as N -acetyl amino polysaccharides. In contrast, nearly all deep-sea HMWDON, and therefore, most HMWDON, is present in amides that resist both chemical hydrolysis and biological degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2084675450,"Since the first evidence of low algal productivity during ice ages in the Antarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean was discovered, there has been debate as to whether it was associated with increased polar ocean stratification or with sea-ice cover, shortening the productive season. The sediment concentration of biogenic barium at Ocean Drilling Program site 882 indicates low algal productivity during ice ages in the Subarctic North Pacific as well. Site 882 is located southeast of the summer sea-ice extent even during glacial maxima, ruling out sea-ice-driven light limitation and supporting stratification as the explanation, with implications for the glacial cycles of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1973988284,"Here we identify a new regulator of endocytosis called RME-6. RME-6 is evolutionarily conserved among metazoans and contains Ras-GAP (GTPase-activating protein)-like and Vps9 domains. Consistent with the known catalytic function of Vps9 domains in Rab5 GDP/GTP exchange, we found that RME-6 binds specifically to Caenorhabditis elegans RAB-5 in the GDP-bound conformation, and rme-6 mutants have phenotypes that indicate low RAB-5 activity. However, unlike other Rab5-associated proteins, a rescuing green fluorescent protein (GFP)–RME-6 fusion protein primarily localizes to clathrin-coated pits, physically interacts with α-adaptin, a clathrin adaptor protein, and requires clathrin to achieve its cortical localization. In rme-6 mutants, transport from the plasma membrane to endosomes is defective, and small 110-nm endocytic vesicles accumulate just below the plasma membrane. These results suggest a mechanism for the activation of Rab5 in clathrin-coated pits or clathrin-coated vesicles that is essential for the delivery of endocytic cargo to early endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2004118265,"We used site-directed spin-labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize the conformational motion that couples energy expenditure to substrate translocation in the multidrug transporter MsbA. In liposomes, ligand-free MsbA samples conformations that depart from the crystal structures, including looser packing and water penetration along the periplasmic side. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding closes the substrate chamber to the cytoplasm while increasing hydration at the periplasmic side, consistent with an alternating access model. Accentuated by ATP hydrolysis, the changes in the chamber dielectric environment and its geometry provide the likely driving force for flipping amphipathic substrates and a potential exit pathway. These results establish the structural dynamic basis of the power stroke in multidrug-resistant ATP-binding cassette (MDR ABC) transporters."

https://openalex.org/W2143244825,"Experimental infection with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) has been used to elucidate the intricate host-pathogen mechanisms that determine innate resistance to infection. Linkage analyses in F2 progeny from MCMV-resistant MA/My (H2k) and MCMV-susceptible BALB/c (H2d) and BALB.K (H2k) mouse strains indicated that only the combination of alleles encoded by a gene in the Klra (also called Ly49) cluster on chromosome 6, and one in the major histocompatibility complex (H2) on chromosome 17, is associated with virus resistance. We found that natural killer cell–activating receptor Ly49P specifically recognized MCMV-infected cells, dependent on the presence of the H2k haplotype. This binding was blocked using antibodies to H-2Dk but not antibodies to H-2Kk. These results are suggestive of a new natural killer cell mechanism implicated in MCMV resistance, which depends on the functional interaction of the Ly49P receptor and the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule H-2Dk on MCMV-infected cells."

https://openalex.org/W2120947434,"We report the implementation of the semiclassical quantum Fourier transform in a system of three beryllium ion qubits (two-level quantum systems) confined in a segmented multizone trap. The quantum Fourier transform is the crucial final step in Shor's algorithm, and it acts on a register of qubits to determine the periodicity of the quantum state's amplitudes. Because only probability amplitudes are required for this task, a more efficient semiclassical version can be used, for which only single-qubit operations conditioned on measurement outcomes are required. We apply the transform to several input states of different periodicities; the results enable the location of peaks corresponding to the original periods. This demonstration incorporates the key elements of a scalable ion-trap architecture, suggesting the future capability of applying the quantum Fourier transform to a large number of qubits as required for a useful quantum factoring algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2051105166,"Microtubule (MT) destabilization promotes the formation of actin stress fibers and enhances the contractility of cells; however, the mechanism involved in the coordinated regulation of MTs and the actin cytoskeleton is poorly understood. LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) regulates actin polymerization by phosphorylating the actin depolymerization factor, cofilin. Here we report that LIMK1 is also involved in the MT destabilization. In endothelial cells endogenous LIMK1 co-localizes with MTs and forms a complex with tubulin via the PDZ domain. MT destabilization induced by thrombin or nocodazole resulted in a decrease of LIMK1 colocalization with MTs. Overexpression of wild type LIMK1 resulted in MT destabilization, whereas the kinase-dead mutant of LIMK1 (KD) did not affect MT stability. Importantly, down-regulation of endogenous LIMK1 by small interference RNA resulted in abrogation of the thrombin-induced MTs destabilization and the inhibition of thrombin-induced actin polymerization. Expression of Rho kinase 2, which phosphorylates and activates LIMK1, dramatically decreases the interaction of LIMK1 with tubulin but increases its interaction with actin. Interestingly, expression of KD-LIMK1 or small interference RNA-LIMK1 prevents thrombin-induced microtubule destabilization and F-actin formation, suggesting that LIMK1 activity is required for thrombin-induced modulation of microtubule destabilization and actin polymerization. Our findings indicate that LIMK1 may coordinate microtubules and actin cytoskeleton.

Our findings indicate that LIMK1 may coordinate microtubules and actin cytoskeleton. Microtubules, polymers of α- and β-tubulins, are key component of the cytoskeleton and are involved in multiple cellular processes such as migration, mitosis, protein, and organelle transport (1Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 2Waterman-Storer C.M. Salmon E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Microtubule dynamics and their spatial arrangements are affected by a number of signaling molecules. Conversely, changes in microtubule dynamics modulate intracellular signal transduction (for review, see Ref. 1Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton undergoes rearrangement under the control of various actin binding, capping, nucleating, and severing proteins, which are intimately involved in regulating the contractile status of the cells (3Dudek S.M. Garcia J.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1487-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Actin dynamics is regulated via transduction of extracellular signals to intracellular events primarily through the members of the Rho family of small GTPases. Rho is known to induce stress fiber formation, whereas Cdc42 and Rac are involved in formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively (4Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5167) Google Scholar). Microtubule disassembly promotes the formation of actin stress fibers and enhances the contractility of cells (5Danowski B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 255-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Agents such as nocodazole or vinblastine that disrupt microtubules induce rapid assembly of actin filaments and focal adhesions (6Bershadsky A. Chausovsky A. Becker E. Lyubimova A. Geiger B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), whereas microtubule stabilization with taxol attenuated these effects. Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by microtubules requires the Rho GTPases (for review, see Ref. 7Wittmann T. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3795-3803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in the coordinated regulation of microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton remain poorly understood.

Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Cofilin regulates actin dynamics by severing actin filaments and sequestering the actin monomer from the pointed end of actin filaments (10Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). However, once phosphorylated at serine 3 by LIMK1 (11Moriyama K. Iida K. Yahara I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Agnew B.J. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17582-17587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), cofilin can no longer bind to actin (40Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), resulting in accumulation of actin polymers. In turn, the activity of LIMK1 is regulated by the members of the Rho-GTPase family members, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (8Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P.

These kinases phosphorylate LIMK1 at Thr-508 located in the activation loop of the kinase domain, resulting in its activation. Here we demonstrate that LIMK1 coordinates both microtubule disassembly and actin polymerization. We provide experimental data to show that LIMK1 interacts with microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton in an agonist-dependent manner. Stimulation of the cells with thrombin decreases the interaction of LIMK1 with tubulin and increases its interaction with actin. Moreover, we show that LIMK1 induces microtubule destabilization and actin stress fiber formation that requires the kinase activity of LIMK1.

[γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cell Cultures and Transfections—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained at first passage from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD, culture line CC-2519) and were utilized at passages 6-10. Cells were cultured in EBM-2 medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Cellgro) and EGM-2 SingleQuots (Cambrex) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Transient transfections of HUVEC were performed with SuperFect Transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with 10% transfection efficiency. Transient transfections of COS-7 cells were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection of siRNAs was performed using DharmaFect1 (Dharmacon); experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Immunocytochemistry—HUVEC grown to confluency on coverslips coated with gelatin were serum-starved for 3 h before each experiment. Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline and washed extensively with Hanks' balanced salt solution. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% fish skin gelatin in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 1 h at room temperature, cells were incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with secondary antibodies. Slides were mounted using ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes). Microscopy was performed using Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with 63× water-immersion objective with appropriate filter sets. Extraction of Cytosolic Proteins from Living Cells—To quantitatively analyze the changes in F-actin and microtubules, we adapted a novel fixation approach (17Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 570-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) that allowed us to extract monomeric actin and tubulin from cells, preserving only polymeric cytoskeletal structures. Cytosolic proteins were extracted from living cells for 1 min at room temperature with extraction solution (0.5% Triton X-100, 4% polyethylene glycol 40,000) in PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2), protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented where needed with 2 μm taxol and/or 2 μm phalloidin followed by fixation in 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, for 10 min, and quenching with 1 mg/ml NaBH4. Cells were rinsed with PEM buffer and stained as described above. For Western blot analysis, extracted cells were rinsed with PEM buffer and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 μm Na3VO4 supplemented with 20 μm taxol. Intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 800 × g, and the supernatants were loaded on 1 ml of buffered cushion (80 mm PIPES, pH 7, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50% glycerol) supplemented with 20 μm taxol and centrifuged for 40 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet and supernatant were subjected to Western blot analysis, and the membrane was probed with anti-LIMK1 and anti-α-tubulin antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—COS-7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% calf serum were transfected with cDNA constructs using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours later, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 μm Na3VO4 unless specified otherwise). Lysates were sonicated on ice, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 800 × g. Lysates were precleared with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz), and the proteins were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3× with lysis buffer, and proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting analysis was performed as described previously (18Vaiskunaite R. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46088-46093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Calculations of the Co-localization Coefficients and Total Intensities of Protein Staining—Images of Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-stained HUVEC monolayers stimulated with thrombin were captured as described above and analyzed using Zeiss enhanced co-localization tool software. Images were differentially segmented between cytosol (black) and microtubules or F-actin (highest gray value) based on image grayscale levels. The microtubule disassembly and actin stress fiber formation were expressed as a ratio of the cytoskeletal polymer area to the area of the whole image and normalized against controls. Co-localization coefficients and the number of pixels in each channel were calculated using Zeiss enhanced co-localization tool software. Data were collected from 20 cells for each experiment. Three independent experiments were performed. The values were statistically processed using Sigma Plot 7.1 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) software. In Vitro Kinase Assays—LIMK1 activity was determined as described previously (19Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M.P. Ahn N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, Myc-tagged LIMK1 (Myc-LIMK1) was transfected with various cDNA constructs as described under “Results.” Forty-eight hours later the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm sodium orthovanadate with 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptine, and 1 μm pepstatin for 30 min at 4 °C. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Myc-LIMK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and protein A-agarose for 24 h at 4 °C. To measure the kinase activity of Myc-LIMK1, 0.2 μg of glutathione S-transferase-cofilin was incubated with the immune complexes for 20 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was terminated by the addition of 6× Laemmli buffer, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated cofilin was visualized by autoradiography, and radioactivity was measured using BAS-2500 (Fuji Film). Aliquots of whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting analysis to confirm the appropriate expression of the transfected proteins as described under “Results.” Statistical Analysis—For statistical analysis, Student's t test was used to compare data between two groups. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. LIMK1 Co-localizes with Microtubules in Endothelial Cells—To examine the relative intracellular distribution of LIMK1 in endothelial cells, HUVEC, were serum-starved, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and co-stained with rabbit anti-LIMK1 and mouse anti-α-tubulin antibodies. Optical sections (0.5-μm-thick confocal sections) of stained cells revealed a striking co-localization of LIMK1 and MTs (Fig. 1A, upper panel), where most of the LIMK1 protein was found along microtubules. Because high levels of actin monomer, tubulin subunits, and cytoskeletal-binding proteins are present in the cytoplasm, the resolution of cytoskeletal polymers could be reduced, making the detailed analysis of the localization of polymer binding proteins rather difficult. Therefore, to determine whether a certain pool of LIMK1 protein is associated with microtubule cytoskeleton, we have adapted a novel fixation approach that allows the extraction of cytosolic proteins, including monomeric tubulin, from living cells, preserving only polymeric cytoskeletal structures (17Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 570-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The extraction of cytosolic LIMK1 and tubulin from living HUVEC was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Importantly, we showed that a certain fraction of endogenous LIMK1 could not be extracted from the living cells and was associated with MTs (Fig. 1A, lower panel). To quantify the relative amount of the co-localized LIMK1 and tubulin, we used the Zeiss enhanced co-localization tool software. Relative cell surface area was selected for each cell. Co-localization coefficient was calculated as c1 (%) = 100% × pixelsCh1,coloc/pixelsCh1, total and found to be equal to 85 ± 4.5%, suggesting a high extent of co-localization. To demonstrate that endogenous LIMK1 and tubulin can form a complex in vitro, tubulin was immunoprecipitated from HUVEC lysates, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by probing with anti-LIMK1 antibody (Fig. 1C). The data showed that tubulin was specifically immunoprecipitated together with endogenous LIMK1, whereas protein A/G-agarose (Fig. 1C) and non-immune sera did not precipitate tubulin or LIMK1 (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction between tubulin and LIMK1 was specific. The PDZ Domain Mediates the Interaction between LIMK1 and Tubulin—LIMK1 interacts with F-actin via its kinase domain, determined using an in vitro co-sedimentation assay (9Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). To identify the LIMK1 domain(s) that mediates the interaction with tubulin, we transfected COS-7 cells with Myc-tagged full-length LIMK1 or FLAG-tagged deletion mutants consisting of the two LIM domains, the PDZ domain, or the kinase domain of LIMK1 (Fig. 2A). Tubulin was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the presence of the LIMK1 proteins was determined using either anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies. Tubulin was immunoprecipitated together with Myc-tagged LIMK1 but not with Myc-tagged zyxin used as a negative control (Fig. 2B, left panel). In addition, Myc-tagged LIMK1 was immunoprecipitated together with endogenous tubulin, whereas non-immune serum did not precipitate Myc-tagged LIMK1 or tubulin (Fig. 2B, right panel). Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-tubulin antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody revealed that the PDZ and not the LIM or the kinase domain interacted with tubulin (Fig. 2C). Modulation of the Microtubule Cytoskeleton Induces Changes in LIMK1 Localization—We analyzed the intracellular distribution of LIMK1 in HUVEC stimulated with thrombin, a multifunctional enzyme that plays a central role in the regulation of biochemical, transcriptional, and functional responses of endothelial cells (for review, see Ref. 20Preissner K.T. Nawroth P.P. Kanse S.M. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 360-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To test the effect of thrombin on microtubule organization in endothelial cells, we treated HUVEC with 25 nm thrombin for 10 min and found pronounced MT destabilization, resulting in disassembly of the peripheral microtubule network (Fig. 3A). Changes in the relative amount of MTs were measured using Zeiss Enhanced Colocalization Tool software. The degree of MT disassembly was expressed as a ratio of the MT area to the area of the whole cell. The data showed that ∼44% of the MTs underwent disassembly upon thrombin stimulation (Fig. 3A), consistent with previously published results (21Birukova A.A. Birukov K.G. Smurova K. Adyshev D. Kaibuchi K. Alieva I. Garcia J.G. Verin A.D. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, the level of acetylated tubulin, representing the stable microtubule pool, was decreased, further confirming the destabilization of MT upon thrombin stimulation (Fig. 3A). Importantly, upon thrombin treatment the cell morphology changed together with the pattern of LIMK1 staining; the apparent filamentous staining of LIMK1 became more homogenous as it translocated to the periphery of the cell (Fig. 3B). Co-localization coefficient calculated as c1 (%) = 100% × pixelsCh1, coloc/pixelsCh1, total of LIMK1 and tubulin significantly decreased from 85 ± 4.5 to 47 ± 6.2%. To determine whether thrombin-induced changes to the LIMK1-staining pattern and localization was due to MTs destabilization, we treated endothelial cells with 1 μm nocodazole for 5 min. Treatment with nocodazole resulted in MT destabilization similar to that seen after incubation with thrombin (Fig. 3B). Similar to cells treated with thrombin, the addition of nocodazole also resulted in more homogenous LIMK1 staining and its re-distribution to the periphery of the cell (Fig. 3B). The co-localization coefficient of LIMK1 and tubulin was significant, from 85 ± 4.5 to 25 ± 7.9%. To determine whether MT destabilization was required for thrombin-dependent changes of LIMK1 intracellular distribution, microtubule cytoskeleton was stabilized by taxol, an agent that binds microtubules and counteracts the effects of GTP hydrolysis (22Amos L.A. Lowe J. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R65-R69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In cells treated with taxol, LIMK1 was colocalized with MTs (Fig. 3C). Stimulation of these cells with thrombin did not affect microtubule structure and did not change the pattern of LIMK1 localization (Fig. 3C). Together, these results indicate that modulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton induces changes in LIMK1 localization. Thrombin Enhances the Interaction of LIMK1 with F-Actin—We have determined that MTs and F-actin are located at different intracellular compartments, with the greater proportion of MTs found in the apical part of the cell, whereas F-actin is found in the basal part of the cell (Fig. 4A). Thrombin that induced MT destabilization and actin polymerization did not promote the co-localization of MTs and F-actin (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the co-localization coefficient calculated as c1 (%) = 100% × pixelsCh1, coloc/pixelsCh1, total was equal to ∼1.61%, suggesting the absence of co-localization. Because LIMK1 was reported to interact with F-actin in in vitro (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 24.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar) and in vivo (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), we analyzed the relative cellular distribution of endogenous F-actin and LIMK1 in HUVEC using confocal microscopy. Surprisingly, in unstimulated cells, very little if any co-localization of LIMK1 with F-actin was observed (Fig. 4B). The co-localization coefficient of LIMK1 and actin was equal 11 ± 6.4. Latrunculin A, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, dramatically decreased F-actin staining but had no effect on the pattern of LIMK1 staining, supporting the notion that LIMK1 did not interact with F-actin in these cells. Interestingly, upon thrombin stimulation, we detected pronounced co-localization between LIMK1 and F-actin, especially at the cell periphery (Fig. 4B). The co-localization coefficient was significantly increased from 11 ± 6.4 to 43 ± 6.4. The Kinase Activity of LIMK1 Is Required for the Interaction with Tubulin and Actin—In endothelial cells, thrombin was shown to activate Rho and its target Rho kinase (25Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H.J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The Rho-associated kinase ROCK activates LIMK1 by phosphorylation at threonine 508 within the kinase activation loop (23Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Rho kinase activity by the pharmacological inhibitor Y27632 prevented thrombin-induced actin stress fiber formation in endothelial cells (21Birukova A.A. Birukov K.G. Smurova K. Adyshev D. Kaibuchi K. Alieva I. Garcia J.G. Verin A.D. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibition of Rho kinase activity prevented thrombin-induced depolymerization of microtubules (21Birukova A.A. Birukov K.G. Smurova K. Adyshev D. Kaibuchi K. Alieva I. Garcia J.G. Verin A.D. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1879-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Initially, we determined whether thrombin could induce activation of LIMK1 by ROCK. Endogenous LIMK1 was immunoprecipitated from HUVEC treated with or without 25 nm thrombin and was used in in vitro kinase assays using cofilin as a substrate. Data showed that stimulation of HUVEC with thrombin for 10 min significantly increased LIMK1-dependent cofilin phosphorylation, as was detected using specific anti-phospho-cofilin antibodies (Fig. 5A). Pretreatment of HUVEC with ROCK inhibitor Y27632 for 10 min completely abolished thrombin-induced cofilin phosphorylation (Fig. 5A), which suggests that LIMK1 is activated upon thrombin stimulation by ROCK. Therefore, we have tested the possibility that inhibition of ROCK would also prevent the thrombin-dependent change of LIMK1 localization in endothelial cells. Pretreatment of HUVEC with Y27632 for 10 min inhibited thrombin-induced actin polymerization and microtubule depolymerization (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, Y27632 also abolished LIMK1 translocation in cells challenged with thrombin (Fig. 5B), suggesting that ROCK was involved in the thrombin-dependent LIMK1 translocation. Initially, we determined the ability of overexpressed wild type LIMK1 or kinase-dead LIMK1 (D446A) to phosphorylate cofilin and to be phosphorylated by the Rho kinase, ROCK2. In vitro kinase assay showed that wild type LIMK1 phosphorylated cofilin (Fig. 5C) and that this phosphorylation was significantly increased by ROCK2. As previously demonstrated, LIMK1 (D446A) could not phosphorylate cofilin (Fig. 5C). Similarly, antibody specific to phosho-Thr-508 of LIMK1 detected basal phosphorylation of wild type LIMK1 and kinase-dead LIMK1 (D446A) that was further enhanced by ROCK2 (Fig. 5C). To determine whether ROCK2 could affect the interaction between wild type LIMK1 and kinase-dead mutant with tubulin and actin, COS-7 were transfected with wild type LIMK1 or LIMK1 (D446A) in the absence or presence of ROCK2. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with either anti-α-tubulin or anti-β-actin antibodies. Western blot analysis showed that the amount of wild type LIMK1 and LIMK1 (D446A) associated with tubulin was greatly decreased in the presence of ROCK2 (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that kinase activity is not required for complex formation with tubulin and for the modulation of LIMK1 association with tubulin upon activation. In contrast, the amount of wild type LIMK1 associated with actin was greatly increased in the presence of ROCK2 (Fig. 5D), supporting the notion that activation of LIMK1 led to increased association with actin. Importantly, although the interaction between LIMK1 (D446A) and actin is similar to that of wild type LIMK1, no changes were observed in the presence of ROCK2 (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that LIMK1 activation increases its association with actin. LIMK1 Is Required for Thrombin-induced MT Destabilization and Actin Polymerization—To determine the ability of LIMK1 to modulate the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton in HUVEC, we studied the effects of overexpressed wild type LIMK1, LIMK1 (D446A), and siRNA. Overexpression of wild type LIMK1 induced MT destabilization, with the relative amount of microtubules decreased by ∼52% (Fig. 6A). Similarly, acetylated tubulin was dramatically decreased in cells expressing wild type LIMK1 (Fig. 6A). Thrombin that induced MT destabilization in non-transfected cells did not cause any further changes in microtubule organization in the cells transfected with wild type LIMK1 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, expression of kinase-dead LIMK1 did not induce MT destabilization in endothelial cells (Fig. 6B). Importantly, it attenuated thrombin-induced MT destabilization and preserved ∼80% of acetylated microtubules (Fig. 6B). We used small interfering RNA targeted against LIMK1 to determine the LIMK1 role in the thrombin-induced modulation of microtubule cytoskeleton. HUVEC were transfected with or without siRNA against LIMK1 or Gα13 (negative control). Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed and probed with antibodies against LIMK1, LIMK2, and Hsp90 (Fig. 6C). Data showed that siRNA-LIMK1 but not siRNA-Gα13 induced significant down-regulation of the LIMK1 protein. Importantly, LIMK2 expression was not affected under any experimental conditions, suggesting that LIMK1 siRNA was specific (Fig. 6C). To demonstrate that LIMK1 is required for MT destabilization induced by thrombin, HUVEC were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the absence or presence of siRNA-LIMK1, and MT stability was analyzed in the cells expressing GFP. In the control experiment using oligonucleotide conjugated to a fluorescent probe, we determined that the cotransfection efficiency with GFP was ∼95%. Data showed that siRNA-LIMK1 did not affect MT stability in non-stimulated HUVEC. Importantly, down-regulation of LIMK1 inhibited MT destabilization induced by thrombin (Fig. 6D). Similar to its effect on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, wild type LIMK1 induced formation of actin stress fibers in endothelial cell (Fig. 7A), whereas stimulation of the HUVEC with thrombin did not further increase F-actin staining. LIMK1 (D446A) did not promote stress fiber formation, but it attenuated actin stress fiber formation upon thrombin stimulation (Fig. 7B). Importantly, down-regulation of endogenous LIMK1 using siRNA also attenuated stress fiber formation upon thrombin stimulation (Fig. 7C). Together, these data indicate that LIMK1 is required for thrombin-induced MTs destabilization and actin polymerization. LIMK1 Interacts with Tubulin—We have demonstrated here that in endothelial cells LIMK1 is colocalized with MTs and can form a complex with tubulin via its PDZ domain. Depolymerization of MTs induced by thrombin or nocodazole resulted in decreased LIMK1 interaction with tubulin and changes LIMK1 localization to sites with increased actin dynamics. This thrombin-dependent translocation of LIMK1 was prevented by stabilization of MTs with taxol. In contrast to previous findings, we did not detect any significant co-localization of LIMK1 with F-actin in non-stimulated endothelial cells; however, co-localization was dramatically increased upon stimulation with thrombin. Finally, LIMK1 was required for the thrombin-induced modulation of MTs destabilization and actin polymerization. These results indicate that LIMK1 may coordinate microtubules and actin cytoskeleton in endothelial cells. Microtubules and LIMK1—In endothelial cells, MT destabilization is associated with stress fiber formation, contraction, and endothelial cell barrier dysfunction (27Verin A.D. Birukova A. Wang P. Liu F. Becker P. Birukov K. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 281: 565-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest direct involvement of MTs in the regulation of endothelial integrity and wound repair, as depolymerization by the microtubule inhibitors nocodazole and vinblastine results in rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, increased stress fiber formation, cell contraction, and permeability (6Bershadsky A. Chausovsky A. Becker E. Lyubimova A. Geiger B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 28Lee T.Y. Gotlieb A.I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 60: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here we showed that LIMK1 could induce MTs destabilization (Fig. 6A). Because the kinase-dead mutant of LIMK1 and LIMK1 down-regulation using siRNA prevented thrombin-induced MTs destabilization, this suggests that LIMK1 is required for the thrombin-induced MT destabilization. The LIM and PDZ domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions (for reviews, see Refs. 29Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 30Retaux S. Bachy I. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 26: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants lacking these domains show increased LIMK1 activity, suggesting that they regulate LIMK1 activity (8Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). We have shown that LIMK1 interacts with tubulin via its PDZ domain (Fig. 2C). Previous yeast two-hybrid and mammalian cell interaction analyses have revealed that LIMK1 interacts via its LIM domains with a number of proteins including protein kinase C (31Kuroda S. Tokunaga C. Kiyohara Y. Higuchi O. Konishi H. Mizuno K. Gill G.N. Kikkawa U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31029-31032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane ligand neuregulin (32Wang J.Y. Frenzel K.E. Wen D. Falls D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20525-20534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic tail of bone morphogenic protein receptor type II (16Foletta V.C. Lim M.A. Soosairajah J. Kelly A.P. Stanley E.G. Shannon M. He W. Das S. Massague J. Bernard O. Soosairaiah J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and LATS1 (33Yang X. Yu K. Hao Y. Li D.M. Stewart R. Insogna K.L. Xu T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although no function was assigned to the interactions between LIMK1 and protein kinase C or neuregulin, the interaction with protein kinase C and LATS1 resulted in down-regulation of LIMK1 activity. However, the PDZ domain was not shown previously to mediate LIMK1 interactions. Microtubule dynamics is regulated by two groups of proteins; one stabilizes microtubules and the other destabilizes them. The proteins belonging to the first group are known as structural microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), such as MAP1B and tau (34Hirokawa N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Proteins that are potent destabilizers of microtubules have been identified more recently (35Belmont L. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 36Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B. Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and include stathmin and SCG10, which belong to the same gene family. The mechanism by which LIMK1 induces MTs destabilization is not yet known. One possibility is that LIMK1 may phosphorylate proteins that either stabilize or destabilize microtubules thereby affecting their function. As cofilin is the only well studied LIMK1 substrate, it is of great importance to identify novel proteins that can be phosphorylated by LIMK1. Another possibility could be that LIMK1 directly affects microtubule dynamics. Such a scenario was described for the Gα subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins where the Gα subunits activate tubulin GTPase and modulate microtubule polymerization dynamics (37Roychowdhury S. Panda D. Wilson L. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13485-13490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). LIMK1 and Cross-talk between Microtubules and Actin Cytoskeleton—The role of LIMK1 in regulation of actin dynamics is well established. LIMK1 regulates actin dynamics via phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin (8Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 9Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K.

Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The functional significance of LIMK1 in actin organization was revealed in studies using LIMK1 (-/-) mice, demonstrating that LIMK1 is essential for normal spine morphology, synaptic regulation, and memory (38Meng Y. Zhang Y. Tregoubov V. Janus C. Cruz L. Jackson M. Lu W.Y. MacDonald J.F. Wang J.Y. Falls D.L. Jia Z. Neuron. 2002; 35: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous findings, our data also demonstrate that LIMK1 induces actin stress fiber formation. In addition, we have shown that the kinase-dead mutant of LIMK1 and down-regulation of LIMK1 with siRNA attenuated actin stress fiber formation induced by thrombin (Fig. 7B) and that stabilization of microtubules with taxol prevented both translocation of LIMK1 to F-actin (Fig. 3C). Cross-talk between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton is essential for the regulation of many cellular functions such as migration, locomotion, cytokinesis, and cell polarity (for review, see Ref. 39Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The Rho family of small GTPases was shown to participate in the regulation of both microtubules and actin (7Wittmann T. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3795-3803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, microtubule disassembly was shown to induce Rho activation (26Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Microtubule disassembly releases the microtubule-bound Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), GEF-H1, to activate RhoA (13Krendel M. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of agonist-dependent microtubule disassembly is not yet understood. We have shown here that LIMK1 induces MTs destabilization and actin polymerization and propose that LIMK1 may serve as a molecular switch that regulates both MTs destabilization and formation of actin stress fibers, thereby providing the molecular mechanism that explains how microtubule disassembly promotes the formation of actin stress fibers. In conclusion, the results presented here suggest that the regulation of microtubules and actin polymerization by LIMK1 provides a mechanism for the coordination of microtubule and the actin cytoskeletons. We propose that in resting endothelial cells LIMK1 is associated with microtubules (Fig. 8). Ligand-induced activation of the Rho-ROCK pathway activates LIMK1, which in turn causes MTs destabilization and release of LIMK1. Consequently, activated LIMK1 associates with actin, thereby inducing its polymerization via cofilin phosphorylation."

We show that the mycobacterial adenylyl cyclase Rv1264 is rendered a pH sensor by its N-terminal domain. In the structure of the inhibited state, catalytic and regulatory domains share a large interface involving catalytic residues. In the structure of the active state, the two catalytic domains rotate by 55° to form two catalytic sites at their interface. Two α helices serve as molecular switches. Mutagenesis is consistent with a regulatory role of the structural transition, and we suggest that the transition is regulated by pH."
https://openalex.org/W1976670150,"Canary song is hierarchically structured: Short stereotyped syllables are repeated to form phrases, which in turn are arranged to form songs. This structure occurs even in the songs of young isolates, which suggests that innate rules govern canary song development. However, juveniles that had never heard normal song imitated abnormal synthetic songs with great accuracy, even when the tutor songs lacked phrasing. As the birds matured, imitated songs were reprogrammed to form typical canary phrasing. Thus, imitation and innate song constraints are separate processes that can be segregated in time: freedom in youth, rules in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W1987146541,"Proteins of the PAT family, named after perilipin, adipophilin, and TIP47 (tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa), are associated with lipid droplets and have previously been localized by immunofluorescence microscopy exclusively to the droplet surface.

Despite this progress, however, virtually nothing is known about the mechanisms by which such proteins are incorporated into lipid droplets or, indeed, how lipid droplets themselves are actually assembled. Current information on the localization of PAT family proteins is inconsistent. For example, although one early report described translocation of adipophilin to the plasma membrane in COS-7 cells during differentiation (10Gao J. Serrero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16825-16830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), more recent work has failed to confirm this finding (11McManaman J.L. Zabaronick W. Schaack J. Orlicky D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 668-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The general consensus, however, is that PAT family proteins occur exclusively in lipid droplets and not in any other subcellular compartment. Although some proteins such as cyclooxygenase (12Dvorak A.M. Morgan E.S. Tzikik D.M. Weller P.F. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl.

One factor limiting our current knowledge of PAT family proteins arises because previous findings on the distribution of these proteins have relied exclusively on immunofluorescence light microscopy (7Miura S.

To shed new light on the distribution and possible intracellular transit routes of these proteins, we have now applied freeze-fracture electron microscopy in combination with immunogold labeling (14Robenek M.J. Schlattmann K. Zimmer K.-P. Plenz G. Troyer D. Robenek H. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1940-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Robenek M.J. Severs N.J. Schlattmann K. Plenz G. Zimmer K.-P. Troyer D.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3443-3449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an approach that permits high resolution localization of proteins in planar views of membranes and lipid bodies. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, standard thin section electron microscopy, and immunogold cryo-electron microscopy were conducted in parallel to provide a comprehensive correlative morphological insight into the events associated with lipid droplet accumulation and the involvement of PAT family proteins. To date, a key focus on the role of PAT family proteins has centered on the adipocyte. During differentiation of the adipocyte, adipophilin, which is initially expressed, is replaced by perilipin (17Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Adipophilin is, however, expressed by differentiated macrophages, which also express the third protein of the PAT family, TIP47 (22Robenek H. Lorkowski S. Schnoor M. Troyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5789-5794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, macrophages can be readily stimulated to accumulate lipid in a similar manner to that of adipocytes. Thus, in seeking to determine whether there are common principles underlying the localization, dynamic reorganization, and potential roles for all three members of the PAT family, the present study examined both cell types. Our findings show that PAT family proteins are not restricted to the lipid droplet surface as previously maintained but also clearly pervade the droplet core. We found that perilipin and caveolin-1 co-localize in lipid droplet cores of adipocytes and that adipophilin and TIP47 co-localize in lipid droplet cores of THP-1 cell-derived macrophages. We further demonstrate unequivocally that the PAT family proteins, in common with caveolin-1, are integral components of the plasma membrane. Under normal culture conditions, the PAT family proteins show a dispersed distribution on the cytoplasmic half of the plasma membrane. Incubation of macrophages and adipocytes with acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) stimulates their PAT family proteins, but not caveolin-1, to cluster on raised domains of the plasma membrane. The elevated domains are demonstrated to mark sites at which lipid droplets are closely pressed against the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that the PAT family proteins are associated with lipid accumulation, functioning in a carrier-mediated fatty acid influx from the extracellular environment into the cell. Such findings further raise the possibility that the transit of PAT family proteins with their fatty acid cargo from specialized plasma membrane domains into lipid droplets functions as part of this influx mechanism. Antibodies—A polyclonal antibody raised in guinea pigs against a synthetic polypeptide representing the N terminus (amino acids 1–16) of human TIP47 (GP30; Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to detect TIP47. Adipophilin was immunolabeled using a mouse monoclonal antibody to a synthetic peptide representing the N terminus (amino acids 5–27) of human adipophilin (AP125; Progen Biotechnik). A polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal region of human perilipin A and B was used to detect perilipin (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Caveolin-1 was immunolabeled using a mouse monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (clone 2297; BD Transduction Laboratories). Irrelevant antibodies against Lamp-1, connexin43, and the inner nuclear membrane proteins LAP2β and emerin were used as controls. Cell Culture—Human THP-1 monocytes from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium containing the supplements recommended by Iwashima et al. (23Iwashima Y. Eto M. Hata A. Kaku K. Horiuchi S. Ushikubi F. Sano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 368-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and differentiated to adherent macrophages by adding 100 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to the medium for 3 days. Because normally cultured macrophages contain few lipid droplets, the cells were induced to accumulate lipid droplets before use by the addition of 50 μg/ml AcLDL at day 2 for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h as described by Hara et al. (24Hara H. Tanishita H. Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Jamamoto A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and Gaus et al. (25Gaus K. Kritharides L.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 574-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% bovine fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells to adipocytes was accomplished by incubating confluent monolayers of cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 10 μm dexamethasone with fresh medium changes every 24 h, followed by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum with medium changes every 24 h for an additional 72 h (19DiDonato D. Brasaemle D.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Both cell types were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. To induce lipid droplet formation in adipocytes, the cells were incubated in 50 μg/ml AcLDL as described for monocytes. Immunofluorescence Light and Confocal Microscopy—Cultured THP-1 monocytes were differentiated to macrophages and lipid-loaded in chamber slides. They were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. After extensive washing, the monocytes were incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific binding and 0.05% Tween 20 for permeabilization. Macrophages were immunolabeled with anti-TIP47 and anti-adipophilin antibodies for 1 h, followed by washing and incubation with anti-guinea pig Cy3-conjugated and anti-mouse Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dianova) for 1 h. To visualize lipid droplets, the fluorophore BODIPY 493/503 (Invitrogen), which specifically stains neutral lipids (26Gocze P.M. Freeman D.A. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), was dissolved in ethanol at 1 mg/ml and added to the secondary antibody solutions to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 dye (Sigma Aldrich). The preparations were mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Hamburg, Germany) and examined in a fluorescence microscope or confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Thin Section Electron Microscopy—Lipid-laden macrophages and adipocytes were grown in flasks, fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% osmium tetroxide in PBS, and dehydrated with ethanol using standard procedures. A few milliliters of propylene oxide were added to the flasks, and the cells were removed by gently swirling and embedded in Epon using standard procedures. Thin sections were cut using an ultramicrotome and contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Ultrathin Cryosection Electron Microscopy—Lipid-laden macrophages and adipocytes were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, scraped from the culture vessels, prepared further for cryoimmunoelectron microscopy basically as outlined by Tokuyasu (27Tokuyasu H.T. Histochem. J. 1980; 12: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), and immunogold-labeled for PAT family proteins as described below. Freeze-Fracture Replication—Cells were scraped from the culture vessels, centrifuged to remove excess medium, re-centrifuged briefly in 30% glycerol (<2 min), fixed in Freon 22 cooled with liquid nitrogen, and freeze-fractured in a BA310 freeze-fracture unit (Balzers AG, Balzers, Liechtenstein) at –100 °C. Replicas of the freshly fractured cells were immediately made by electron beam evaporation of platinum-carbon and carbon at angles of 38 and 90° and to thicknesses of 2 and 20 nm, respectively. The replicas were incubated overnight in 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (21Fujimoto K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3443-3449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to remove cellular material except for those molecules adhering directly to the replicas. They were then washed in distilled water and incubated briefly in 5% bovine serum albumin before immunolabeling. Immunolabeling of Freeze-Fracture Replicas and Cryosections— Freeze-fracture replicas were immunogold-labeled with the following: 1) anti-TIP47 antibodies followed by a donkey anti-guinea pig 12-nm gold conjugate; 2) anti-adipophilin or anti-caveolin-1 antibodies followed by a goat anti-mouse 12- or 18-nm gold conjugate; and 3) anti-perilipin antibodies followed by a goat anti-rabbit 12- or 18-nm gold conjugate. Double immunogold labeling of replicas of adipocytes was carried out using a mixture of anti-perilipin and anti-caveolin-1 antibodies followed by a mixture of goat anti-rabbit 12-nm and goat antimouse 18-nm gold conjugates (both conjugates from Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, VA). Double labeling of replicas of macrophages was carried out by a mixture of anti-TIP47 and anti-adipophilin antibodies followed by a mixture of donkey anti-guinea pig 12-nm and goat anti-mouse 18-nm gold conjugates. Ultrathin cryosections of macrophages were immunolabeled with anti-adipophilin followed by a goat anti-mouse 12-nm gold conjugate. Ultrathin cryosections of adipocytes were immunolabeled with anti-perilipin followed by a goat anti-rabbit 18-nm gold conjugate. Control specimens, prepared without the primary antibodies, were essentially free of gold particles. Antibodies against Lamp-1, connexin43, LAP2β, and emerin did not bind to replicas or cryosections of lipid droplets in adipocytes and macrophages. Electron Microscopy—Examination of thin sections, immunogold-labeled ultrathin cryosections, and immunogold-labeled freeze-fracture replicas was carried out using a Philips 410 transmission electron microscope. Observations on freeze-fracture/immunogold replicas were based on examination of >200 cells for each time point from three separate experiments. Lipid Droplet Accumulation—Normally cultured macrophages and adipocytes contain few lipid droplets. To induce lipid droplet formation, the cells were exposed to 50 μg/ml AcLDL for 6–24 h. Immunofluorescence confocal light microscopy of neutral lipids (BODIPY staining), adipophilin, and TIP47 demonstrated a time-dependent accumulation of lipid droplets and associated PAT family proteins in macrophages (Fig. 1). Conventional thin section electron microscopy confirmed progressive lipid droplet accumulation over the same time course in both macrophages (Fig. 2) and adipocytes (Fig. 3). Solitary lipid droplets and clusters of lipid droplets are apparent, some of which contain sheet-like structures. Some lipid droplets are seen lying adjacent to the plasma membrane; these may have a flattened shape at their sites of apposition, or the plasma membrane may appear elevated (Fig. 3A), thus increasing the area of association between the two. Cryosections viewed by electron microscopy reveal the lipid droplets as essentially electron-lucent vesicles with little internal structure in both macrophages (Fig. 4) and adipocytes (Fig. 5). Labeling for PAT family proteins in cryosections is predominantly seen at the surfaces of the droplets, as illustrated in Fig. 4 for adipophilin in macrophages and in Fig. 5 for perilipin in adipocytes.Fig. 2Accumulation of lipid droplets in macrophages.

When frozen cells are fractured, the fracture preferentially splits membranes into their two constituent half-membrane leaflets along a plane between the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids in the bilayer. In the case of the plasma membrane, one leaflet remains attached to the extracellular space (E-half), whereas the other leaflet remains attached to the cytoplasm or protoplasm (P-half). The view of the E-half revealed by freeze fracturing is termed the E-face, and that of the P-half is termed the P-face (28Branton D. Bullivant S. Gilula N.W. Karnovsky M.J. Moor H. Mühlethaler K. Northcote D. Packer L. Safir B. Safir P. Speth V. Staehelin L.A. Steere R.L. Weinstein R.S. Science. 1975; 190: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Endocytotic vesicles arise by invagination of the plasma membrane, and the fracture faces of their inner (luminal) leaflet and those of all lysosomes and secretory granules are E-faces, homologous to the E-face of the plasma membrane. Similarly, the E-face of the Golgi cisternae, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the nuclear envelope is the fracture face of the luminal leaflet that encloses the endoplasmic compartment. The fracture faces of the cytoplasmic leaflets of these intracellular membranes systems are, correspondingly, P-faces, equivalent to the P-face of the plasma membrane. The sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment applied to freeze-fracture replicas is designed to flush away cellular residues while retaining, for immunogold labeling, only those molecules adhering directly to the metal of the replicas. Labeling was carried out using primary antibodies against PAT family proteins and caveolin-1 with appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to colloidal gold. Viewed in the electron microscope, the electron-dense gold particles clearly mark the positions of these proteins, superimposed upon the en face membrane views and other ultrastructural features of the cell in replicated view. Whereas thin-sectioned and cryosectioned lipid droplets appear generally devoid of internal structure (Figs. 2, 3, 4), freeze-fracturing reveals multiple internal lamellae and amorphous appearing areas in the droplet cores (Figs. 6 and 13). Standard freeze-fracture nomenclature cannot readily be applied to lipid droplets, as these organelles do not have a limiting membrane enclosing a lumen. Thus, rather than P- or E-face designations, the views are more accurately described by their location within the lipid droplet and by the type of fracture through the droplet (i.e. convex, concave, or cross-fracture). However, because the outermost monolayer of the lipid droplet is thought to be derived from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER membrane, it is appropriate to refer to the fracture face seen when the outermost layer of the droplet is concavely fractured as the P-face-equivalent and to refer to its complementary view, seen in convex fractures, as the E-face equivalent.Fig. 13Lipid droplet beneath an adipophilin and TIP47 cluster in the plasma membrane demonstrated by freeze-fracture immunogold labeling. Immunogold labeling of adipophilin (18-nm gold) and TIP47 (12-nm gold; examples indicated by circles) after lipid loading of macrophages with AcLDL for 24 h. Adipophilin and TIP47 are co-clustered on the P-face of the plasma membrane and also on the E-face equivalent of an underlying convexly fractured lipid droplet. The lipid droplet is closely apposed to the plasma membrane cluster. Arrowheads indicate the line at which the fracture plane has skipped between the plasma membrane and layers of the lipid droplet. Adipophilin is also labeled on layers exposed by deeper fractures penetrating the core of the lipid droplet (arrows). Bar, 0.2 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Distribution of Perilipin and Caveolin-1 in Adipocytes— Freeze-fracture replicas of lipid droplets in adipocytes reveal a variety of appearances. Lipid droplets that are cross-fractured reveal a simple homogeneous content or multiple internal fracture faces. Concavely fractured droplets show a single surface layer representing the fracture face of the outermost monolayer of the lipid droplet (P-face equivalent). Droplets that are fractured in multiple layers exhibit an onion-like morphology (Fig. 6A). By double immunogold labeling, using gold markers of distinct sizes to simultaneously identify two different proteins in freeze-fracture views of lipid droplets, caveolin-1, and perilipin are seen to be present not only in the outermost monolayer (Fig. 6B) but also in several other fracture planes (Fig. 6A). Cross-fractured lipid droplets further reveal that labeling for caveolin-1 and perilipin occurs deep within and throughout the core of the lipid droplet (Fig. 6A). Mitochondria, ER, nuclear membranes, the Golgi, and the cytoplasmic matrix are free of labels. Controls in which the primary antibody is omitted show negligible labeling. No immunogold labeling on lipid droplets is found when antibodies against Lamp-1, connexin43, LAP2β, and emerin are used. Apart from the lipid droplets, abundant immunolabeling for caveolin-1 and perilipin is apparent in the plasma membrane. The perilipin label is found exclusively on the P-face of the plasma membrane; no label is seen on the E-face. Under normal culture conditions (i.e. without AcLDL in the culture medium), the perilipin label is widely dispersed across the plane of the membrane (Fig. 7A). During lipid loading of the adipocytes with AcLDL, however, a remarkable alteration in distribution takes place; the perilipin labeling becomes clustered in raised plasma membrane domains. Evidence for the start of this change is apparent at 6 h of AcLDL incubation (Fig. 7B), but the clusters become progressively larger, more abundant, and with a more densely packed label at 12 and 24 h. Over this period, the raised domains become more sharply delineated, with dimensions slightly larger than lipid droplets by 24 h (Fig. 7C). Correlative thin section electron microscopy and fluorescence light microscopy disclose a concomitant progressive increase in lipid droplet formation. Although considerable variation in the extent of cluster development is apparent in individual cells at any given time point because the cells are not synchronized, the trend toward larger, more closely aggregated, and more numerous clusters over time is clear from an examination of multiple samples. As with perilipin, the caveolin-1 label is also found on the P-face of the plasma membrane but not the E-face. Generally, caveolae are strongly marked on their rims, but caveolin-1 labeling occurs frequently in intervening plasma membrane regions. Double labeling of perilipin and caveolin-1 demonstrates that, under normal culture conditions, caveolin-1 retains this uniform distribution (Fig. 8A). However, after lipid loading the distribution of caveolin-1, in contrast to that of perilipin, remains virtually unchanged; caveolin-1 thus does not participate in the clustering proc"

CellBiol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar).TGFβ, the founding member of the TGFβ superfamily, mediates itseffects through two Ser/Thr kinase receptors, termed the TGFβ type I(TβRI) and II (TβRII) receptors(7Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4737) Google Scholar). TGFβ ligand bindingto TβRII triggers recruitment of TβRI, thereby forming an activereceptor complex. Further propagation of TGFβ signaling can then beinitiated through Smad-dependent or Smad-independent pathways, such as themitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway(8Derynck R. Zhang Y.E.

Signaling through the Smadfamily of proteins is triggered by phosphorylation of the receptor-activatedSmads by TβRI. In the case of Smad2 and Smad3 and the TGFβ- andactivin-specific receptor-activated Smads, this phosphorylation can befacilitated by SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation)(10Tsukazaki T.

After phosphorylation,receptor-activated Smads dimerize with the required co-Smad, Smad4,translocate to the nucleus, and activate gene transcription by either directlybinding to DNA or through cooperation with other DNA binding transcriptionfactors such as FAST-1 (12Chen X.

We previouslyhave demonstrated that TGFβ-mediated induction of FN is mediated througha JNK-dependent, Smad-independent pathway(21Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H.

Furthermore, efficientactivation of the Smad pathway may require activation of JNK, in thatfibroblasts that express antisense JNK oligonucleotides show decreasedTGFβ-stimulated Smad2 phosphorylation(25Utsugi M. Dobashi K. Ishizuka T. Masubuchi K. Shimizu Y. Nakazawa T. Mori M. Am. J. Respir. CellMol.

McDonnell M. Law B.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37413-37420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar).Activation of JNK is triggered by dual phosphorylation of a TPY motif bythe upstream MAPK kinases MKK7 and MKK4, whereas activation of these MAPKkinases can be mediated through multiple MAPK kinase kinases including membersof the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) kinase (MEKK),mixed-lineage kinase, and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase families, Tpl2,and TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)(27Davis R.J.

TAK1 was initiallyidentified as a kinase whose activity was stimulated by TGFβ and BMP4, aTGFβ superfamily member, resulting in phosphorylation of MKK4(28Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K.

Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). TAB1 has been shown toassociate with the type I bone-morphogenetic protein receptor when theX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis is co-expressed, suggesting a possible link ofthe receptor complex to TAK1. However, this association may involve anotherinteracting protein since yeast two-hybrid analysis failed to demonstrate adirect interaction between X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis and type I BMPreceptor (34Yamaguchi K.

Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,35Morris S.M. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar,36Oleinikov A.V.

Disabled family memberspossess a highly conserved N-terminalphosphotyrosine-interacting/phosphotyrosine binding domain (PID/PTB), recentlyrenamed the DAB homology domain(37Yun M. Keshvara L.

Dab2 directly binds to several members of thelipoprotein receptor family through its PTB domain(35Morris S.M. Cooper J.A.

Traffic. 2002; 3: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We have recentlydemonstrated that Dab2 serves as an adaptor molecule to link the TGFβreceptors to activation of the Smad pathway(11Hocevar B.A. Smine A Xu X.-X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Expression of Dab2restored Smad-dependent responses to a TGFβ-signaling-deficient mutantcell line. In addition, Dab2 was found to augment TGFβ-stimulated FNinduction, a JNK-dependent and Smad-independent response(11Hocevar B.A. Smine A Xu X.-X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We, therefore, wished toexplore the possibility that Dab2 could directly mediate TGFβ-stimulatedJNK activity, leading to induction of FN.We report here that stable small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencingof Dab2 in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts leads to decreased TGFβ-stimulated FNinduction, concomitant with decreased TGFβ-mediated JNK activation. Dab2is shown to directly stimulate JNK activity, which is blocked by expression ofa kinase-deficient form of TAK1, TAKKW. We also report that abrogation of TAK1expression or TAKKW overexpression leads to decreased TGFβ-stimulated FNprotein and mRNA induction, respectively. At a biological level we provideevidence suggesting that Dab2 is required for TGFβ-stimulated cellularmigration, a JNK-dependent response. Dab2, thus, provides a link between theactivated TGFβ receptors and TAK1, leading to activation of theJNK-signaling pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Recombinant TGFβ2 was generously provided byGenzyme (Cambridge, MA).

The pPur vector was purchased from Clontech.Cell Culture and Generation of Cell Lines—NIH3T3 and COS7cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with10% newborn calf serum. A10 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle'smedium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To generate cells that stablyexpress the siDab2 construct, NIH3T3 and A10 cells in 100-mm-diameter plateswere transfected with the siDab2 construct (10 μg) and pPur (2 μg)utilizing FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) or Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen),respectively, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectantswere selected in serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumsupplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin and maintained in the same media eitheras a pool (A10) or individual clones (NIH3T3). Expression levels of Dab2 wereassessed by Western analysis utilizing the monoclonal α-p96 antibody. Togenerate the 3T3-TAKKW cell line, NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with TAKKW(10 μg) and pPur (2 μg) constructs using FuGENE 6 and selected andmaintained as a pool in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10%newborn calf serum and 1 μg/ml puromycin. Expression of the TAKKW constructwas verified by Western analysis utilizing a monoclonal α-HAantibody.Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Protein KinaseAssays—For immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, cellswere lysed in buffer D (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 10%glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3V04, andComplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Diagnostics), andimmunoprecipitation was carried out as previously described(21Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L.

For JNK assays in COS7cells, transient transfection of the indicated constructs was performedutilizing FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer'sprotocols. After 48 h cells were lysed in buffer D. Equal amounts of cellularprotein (250 μg) were immunoprecipitated with α-FLAG antibody andcaptured on protein G-Sepharose beads. The beads were subsequently washedtwice with buffer D followed by 1 wash in kinase assay buffer (25mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1mm Na3VO4, and Complete EDTA-free proteaseinhibitor mixture; Roche Diagnostics). Kinase reactions were performed in 30μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg GST-c-Jun (Stratagene), 50μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactionswere incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of anequal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 10%SDS/PAGE gels, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. The JNK assay inNIH3T3 and 3T3-siDab2 clones was performed as described previously(32Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol.

Reaction products were resolved on 10%SDS/PAGE gels, transferred to Immobilon membranes, and subjected to Westernblot analysis with α-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) antibody II.Fibronectin Protein Assay—TGFβ-stimulated FN inductionwas determined as previously described(21Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception thatin some assays gelatin-agarose beads (Sigma) were used to precipitate35S-labeled FN from the media of labeled cells. Samples wereresolved on 6% SDS/PAGE gels, subjected to fluorography using Enhance(Amersham Biosciences), and visualized by autoradiography. The inhibitorsSP600125 (10 μm and 50 μm), SB203580 (10μm), or PD98059 (10 μm) were added simultaneouslywith TGFβ (2 ng/ml) at the initiation and maintained throughout the FNassay.Transient siRNA-mediated Silencing of TAK1—The negativecontrol, TAK1 pool, and individual double-stranded RNA oligos to TAK1 werepurchased from Dharmacon RNA Technologies (SMARTpool Plus, Q-004500-00-09) andresuspended in reagents provided by the manufacturer. NIH3T3 cells weretransfected in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) usingOligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) with 200 nm concentrations eachof double-stranded RNA oligo per manufacturer's instructions.

Total RNA (40 μg) of each sample was resolvedin a 1.2% formaldehyde/agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, andsubjected to Northern analysis utilizing probes to FN(45Tong L. Pav S. White D.M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Wound Closure Assay—For the wound closure assay, confluentmonolayer cells in 60-mm plates were wounded by manual scraping with a pipettetip. Plates were washed several times to remove non-adherent cells and placedin complete media with or without TGFβ (5 ng/ml). Assessment of cellmigration into the wounded area was performed by microscopy after 24 h. Cellmigration of NIH3T3 and 3T3-siDab2 cells was quantitated utilizing theQCM™ 24-well colorimetric cell migration assay (Chemicon International)as suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, 2 × 105 cellsresuspended in serum-free media were added to the upper chamber and allowed tomigrate through a membrane insert with an 8-μm pore size for 4 h toward 10%fetal bovine serum-containing media in the absence or presence of 5 ng/mlTGFβ. After the incubation period, the cells on the upper surface of themembrane were removed, cells that had migrated through the membrane werestained, and 5 random fields were counted by microscopy at 250×magnification.RESULTSDab2 Expression Is Required for TGFβ-stimulated FNInduction—We have previously shown that TGFβ-stimulated FNinduction is greatly abrogated in a TGFβ-signaling-deficient cell line,derived from the human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line, which expresses a mutantform of Dab2 (11Hocevar B.A. Smine A Xu X.-X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,21Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, wished totest whether Dab2 expression is required for TGFβ-mediated FN inductionin two different cell types that respond to TGFβ stimulation, namelyfibroblast and smooth muscle cells. To ablate the expression of Dab2, we choseto use stable expression of a siRNA specifically targeted to decreaseexpression of the p96 splice-form of Dab2, which we previously have shown torestore TGFβ signaling to a mutant cell line(11Hocevar B.A. Smine A Xu X.-X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We have previouslycharacterized this siRNA-Dab2 vector in several cell lines with regard to itsspecificity for the p96 form of Dab2(71Prunier C. Howe P.H. J.Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17540-17548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Stable introduction ofthe siDab2 construct into mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 and rat A10 aortic smoothmuscle cells was performed. As shown by Western analysis inFig. 1A, the siDab2construct was able to decrease the p96, but not p67, form of Dab2 expressionin individual clones of NIH3T3 cells (left panel) and in a pool ofA10 (right panel) cells to varying extents. Analysis of these clonesfor induction of FN synthesis after TGFβ stimulation reveals a dosedependence of Dab2 expression for both basal and TGFβ-mediated FNinduction, in that clones that express the lowest levels of Dab2(i.e. clone 8 and 9) also demonstrate the lowest basal andTGFβ-stimulated FN protein induction(Fig. 1B). FN proteinexpression was also assessed in wild-type and the siDab2-expressing A10 cellsafter stimulation with TGFβ for 4 and 24 h. Similarly to NIH3T3 cells,TGFβ-mediated FN induction was markedly attenuated in A10 cells withdecreased Dab2 expression (Fig.1C). These results, thus, demonstrate that Dab2expression is required for TGFβ-mediated FN induction in two differentcell types that can be physiologically stimulated to express FN afterTGFβ treatment, which are fibroblast and smooth muscle cells.Dab2 Directly Stimulates JNK Activity—We have previouslyshown that TGFβ stimulation of human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells leads toactivation of the JNK pathway and that TGFβ-stimulated induction of FNcould be blocked by overexpression of dominant-negative JNK and MKK4(21Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, wished toassess whether Dab2 could directly activate the JNK pathway, since we observedthat TGFβ-stimulated FN induction was dependent on expression of Dab2. Inaddition, we wished to assess the contribution of the individual domains ofDab2 to JNK activation, because we have previously demonstrated thatrestoration of TGFβ signaling to a TGFβ-signaling-deficient cellline requires both the N-terminal PTB and C-terminal proline-rich domains ofDab2 (11Hocevar B.A. Smine A Xu X.-X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To assess this,COS7 cells were transiently transfected with JNK along with full-length Dab2or various constructs containing the different domains of Dab2(Fig. 2, A andC). As shown in Fig.2B, expression of full-length Dab2 is capable ofefficiently stimulating JNK activity that was assessed by the ability of JNKto phosphorylate GST-c-Jun in an in vitro kinase assay. Furthermore,the construct bearing only the C-terminal portion of Dab2, designated #323consisting of amino acids 323–770, stimulates JNK activity to the sameextent as full-length (Fig.2B). Expression of a construct bearing the proline-richdomain of Dab2, #534, consisting of amino acids 534–770, however, is notsufficient to stimulate JNK activity even though it is expressed at the samelevel as full-length Dab2 (Fig.2C). These results demonstrate that Dab2 can directlymediate JNK activation and that this activity can be localized to theC-terminal domain of Dab2.Fig. 2Dab2 directly stimulates JNK activity.

Here, we investigate the proteins that are involved in organizing this network, and we show that end-binding protein 1 (EB1), adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) and p150Glued — although considered to be microtubule plus-end-binding proteins — are localized along the entire length of microtubules within the network, and at T-junctions between microtubules. The network shows microtubule behaviours that arise from physical interactions between microtubules, including microtubule plus-end stabilization on the sides of other microtubules, and sliding of microtubule ends along other microtubules. APC also localizes to the basal cortex. Microtubules grew over and paused at APC puncta; an in vitro reconstituted microtubule network overlaid APC puncta; and microtubule network reconstitution was inhibited by function-blocking APC antibodies. Thus, APC is a component of a cortical template that guides microtubule network formation."

Group 1 mGluRs(mGluR1 and mGluR5) are linked to phospholipase C, whereas Group 2 mGluRs(mGluR2 and mGluR3) and Group 3 mGluRs (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8)are negatively linked to adenylate cyclase.

Although both mGluR1 and mGluR5 stimulate intracellular Ca2+release, they differ in that mGluR5 activation results in Ca2+oscillations, whereas mGluR1 activation results in a single Ca2+transient with or without subsequent low frequency oscillations(9Kawabata S.

Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A previous study(10Kawabata S. Tsutusmi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a shortstretch of amino acids in the C terminus of mGluR5 was the criticaldeterminant regulating Ca2+ oscillations, specifically the identityof a single amino acid residue, Thr-840. In addition, it was reported that thedirect phosphorylation of Thr-840 by PKC was the mechanism regulating theCa2+ oscillations(10Kawabata S. Tsutusmi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the current study, wehave investigated the direct phosphorylation of mGluR5 by PKC usingphosphopeptide analysis. Surprisingly, we demonstrated that Thr-840 is not aPKC substrate but only plays a permissive role for PKC phosphorylation of theadjacent amino acid Ser-839. Consequently, it is the PKC phosphorylation ofSer-839 that regulates mGluR5-elicited Ca2+ oscillations.Furthermore, we showed that the analogous serine in mGluR1, Ser-853, is notphosphorylated due to an adjacent aspartic acid residue but can bephosphorylated when the adjacent amino acid is mutated to a permissiveresidue. Therefore, we have found that Thr-840 of mGluR5 and Asp-854 of mGluR1are the critical determinants of the distinct Ca2+ transientselicited by mGluR5 and mGluR1, respectively. However, our data clearlydemonstrate that this is because of the differential effect these residueshave on the PKC phosphorylation of a conserved adjacent serine, not because ofthe direct PKC phosphorylation of Thr-840 on mGluR5. DNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mGluR5 cDNAwas a generous gift from Dr. S. Nakanishi (Kyoto University). The full-lengthC terminus (amino acids 828–1171) and first one-third of the C terminus(amino acids 828–944) of mGluR5 were amplified from rat mGluR5 cDNAusing PCR. The first one-third of the C terminus (amino acids 842–958)of rat mGluR1α was also amplified by PCR. The PCR products were thendigested with EcoRI and subcloned in-frame into pGEX-4T-1 GST fusion vector(Amersham Biosciences). mGluR5 (S839A, T840A, T840D, S834A, T837A, and T838A)and mGluR1α (S853A, D854A, D854T, and S853A/D854A) mutations on GSTfusion constructs or pRK5-mGluR5 were generated using the QuikChangesite-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following themanufacturer's instructions. Mutations were confirmed by sequenceanalysis. Fusion Protein Production and in VitroPhosphorylation—Fusion proteins for wild-type and mutant C terminiof mGluR5 or mGluR1α were purified for the most part in accordance withthe protocol provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). In brief,DNA constructs were transformed into BL21 bacterial cells. 50-ml cultures weregrown until the cultures reached the mid-log phase of growth(A550 = 0.5–1.0) after adding 1 ml of overnightcultures. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1mm) was added to cultures to induce fusion protein expression.After 4 h of induction, the cells were lysed with 5 ml of B-PER bacterialprotein extraction reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The bacterial lysates wereincubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, andthen the beads were washed with 10× bed volume of phosphate-bufferedsaline. The fusion proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH8.0) containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. The fusion proteins werephosphorylated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.67 mmCaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, 200 mm cold ATP, 1 pmol of[γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) with 25 ng of purified PKC(Promega, Madison, WI) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped byadding SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Thephosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred tonitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). The bands werevisualized by autoradiography and were excised for in vitrophosphopeptide mapping. Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Mapping—Peptide mapping wasperformed as previously described(11Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L.

Briefly, phosphorylatedproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Therelevant bands were excised and soaked for 1 h in tubes containing 1 ml of 1%polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 in 100 mm acetic acid. After washing with0.4% NH4HCO3, the proteins on the membrane were digestedwith trypsin overnight at 37 °C. Supernatants containing the trypticdigestion products were dried in a SpeedVac, washed twice with 900 μl ofH2O, and resuspended in 5 μl of H2O. One or two μlof the dissolved phosphopeptides were spotted onto a cellulose thin layerchromatography plate (Merck). The phosphopeptides were resolved in the firstdimension by electrophoresis in buffer containing 2.5% formic acid and 7.8%acetic acid. Separation by ascending chromatography in the second dimensionwas performed using buffer containing 62.5% isobutyric acid, 4.8% pyridine,1.9% butanol, and 2.9% acetic acid. The thin layer chromatography plate wasair-dried, and the peptide map was visualized by PhosphorImager analysis. Measurement of Ca2+Oscillations—HeLa cells (American Type Culture CollectionCCL-2) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetalbovine serum on coverglasses. The cells were transfected with wild-type ormutant constructs of mGluR5 using Cal-Phos mammalian calcium phosphatetransfection kit (BD Biosciences). The cells were incubated with transfectants12 h before changing to fresh medium and analyzed 36–48 h followingtransfection. The cells were loaded with 5 μm Oregon Green 488BAPTA-1 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C and thenwashed three times with HEPES-buffered solution containing 135 mmNaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 1.8mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES. After 1 h ofincubation in the same buffer, confocal microscopy was performed on a ZeissLSM-510 laser-scanning microscope after the treatment of a mGluR5 agonist (500μm glutamate). A time scan was performed for 300 s for eachsample. Cells exhibiting a Ca2+ response to agonist applicationwere classified as oscillating or non-oscillating, with oscillating cellsdefined as those having oscillation frequencies >1/min with constantamplitude and frequency and non-oscillating cells defined as those having anycalcium transients other than oscillations defined above, including a singlecalcium peak, a single sustained calcium plateau, a single calcium peak or aplateau with slow oscillations in a later phase, or a single peak with ashoulder(8Nash M.S.

Generation of Phosphorylation State-specific Antibodies andImmunoblotting—Rabbit phosphospecific antibodies againstphosphorylated Ser-839 of mGluR5 were generated by BIOSOURCE International(Camarillo, CA). Rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptideN-C(EE)FTT[pS]TVVR-C. The sera were collected and affinity-purified using theantigen peptide. Amino acids in parentheses represent additional glutamic acidresidues that were added to the N terminus of peptides to promote solubility.Fusion proteins (wild-type GST-mGluR5-Cprox, GST-mGluR5-Cprox (S839A), and GSTalone) were phosphorylated by purified PKC in vitro as describedunder “Fusion Protein Production and in VitroPhosphorylation.” Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred toa polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Phosphorylation of Ser-839 on mGluR5C-terminal fusion proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting with the pSer839phosphospecific antibody. PKC is an important modulator of mGluR function(10Kawabata S.

Neurochem. 2003; 84: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar);however, the biochemical analyses characterizing the direct phosphorylation ofmGluRs by PKC have been lacking. Therefore, we began to characterize themGluR5 C terminus as the region most likely to contain PKC phosphorylationsites. To evaluate precisely the direct phosphorylation of the mGluR5 Cterminus by PKC, we generated a GST fusion protein containing the entiremGluR5 C terminus (GST-mGluR5-C; Fig.1A). Previous studies have reported the phosphorylationof specific residues, including Thr-840, on mGluR5 within the proximal Cterminus near the seventh transmembrane domain(10Kawabata S. Tsutusmi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,18Gereau IV, R.W. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1998; 20: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); therefore, we alsogenerated a GST fusion protein containing the first one-third of the mGluR5 Cterminus, GST-mGluR5-Cprox (Fig.1A). We performed an in vitro phosphorylationassay to evaluate the direct phosphorylation of mGluR5 by PKC. GST-mGluR5fusion proteins were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and PKC for 30min at 30 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thefusion proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, the phosphorylated proteinswere proteolyzed with trypsin, and the peptide fragments were resolved in twodimensions, resulting in a distinct phosphopeptide map. The peptide map of themGluR5 C terminus revealed multiple phosphopeptides that varied in theirintensity (Fig. 1B).Interestingly, the peptide maps of GST-mGluR5-C and GST-mGluR5-Cprox wereindistinguishable (Fig.1B). This was compelling evidence that the major PKCphosphorylation sites on the mGluR5 C terminus were contained within theproximal one-third of this region. Therefore we used the GST-mGluR5-Cproxfusion protein for further analysis. We next wanted to evaluate the phosphorylation of Thr-840 within mGluR5,which had been reported to be the PKC substrate responsible for regulating theCa2+ oscillations(10Kawabata S. Tsutusmi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We began by evaluatingPKC phosphorylation of the wild-type mGluR5 C terminus and comparing it to themGluR5 C terminus containing an alanine mutation of the critical threonine(GST-mGluR5-Cprox T840A). We performed in vitro phosphorylation ofthe wild-type GST-mGluR5-Cprox along with the GST-mGluR5-Cprox (T840A).However, we found no change in the peptide maps(Fig. 1C), which wassurprising, as Thr-840 had been reported to be a PKC substrate(10Kawabata S. Tsutusmi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We also investigated thethreonine to aspartic acid mutation (GST-mGluR5-Cprox T840D) described in thatstudy (10Kawabata S. Tsutusmi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast toT840A, we found that T840D did result in the disappearance of a distinctphosphopeptide on the map compared with wild-type mGluR5(Fig. 1C). These dataare therefore inconsistent with the direct phosphorylation of Thr-840 by PKC,as both the alanine and aspartic acid mutation would abolish directphosphorylation of Thr-840. Instead, these experiments suggest that the T840Dmutant specifically disrupted the phosphorylation of some other site onmGluR5. We therefore tested the alternative hypothesis that the identity of the 840amino acid affects the substrate specificity of PKC for a nearby residue. Thefirst one-third of the mGluR5 C terminus contains many potential PKCphosphorylation sites, with several serines and threonines included within thepredicted tryptic peptide fragment containing Thr-840(834SAFTTSTVVR843). One candidate residue for PKCphosphorylation was the adjacent Ser-839(Fig. 2A). To testthis hypothesis, we mutated Ser-839 to alanine (GST-mGluR5-Cprox S839A) andevaluated it using the in vitro phosphorylation assay. We found thatPKC phosphorylation of GST-mGluR5-Cprox (S839A) resulted in a phosphopeptidemap with a phosphopeptide missing (Fig.2B), yielding a map with the same pattern as the peptidemap of the T840D mutant (Fig.1C). This was consistent with the T840D mutationdisrupting the PKC phosphorylation of the adjacent Ser-839. Furthermore, pointmutations of the other serine and threonines within the predicted peptidefragment (S834A, T837A, T838A) did not affect phosphorylation and resulted inpeptide maps that did not differ from wild type(Fig. 2C). In additionto the peptide map analysis, we also generated a phosphorylationstate-specific antibody recognizing mGluR5 phosphorylated on Ser-839 to probewhether or not Ser-839 is directly phosphorylated. We performed an invitro PKC phosphorylation assay of GST, wild-type GST-mGluR5-Cprox, andGST-mGluR5-Cprox (S839A), resolved the proteins by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblottedwith our Ser-839 phosphoantibody. We found that the antibody specificallyrecognized PKC-phosphorylated wild-type GST-mGluR5-Cprox and did not recognizePKC-phosphorylated GST-mGluR5-Cprox (S839A), consistent with the directphosphorylation of Ser-839 in vitro(Fig. 2D). Based on our mutagenesis studies of mGluR5, it followed that mGluR1αmight be phosphorylated by PKC on serine 853, which is analogous to Ser-839 ofmGluR5 (see alignment in Fig.2A), when we replace the adjacent aspartic acid (Asp-854in wild-type mGluR1α) with a permissive amino acid. To characterize thedirect phosphorylation of mGluR1α, we made a GST fusion protein of theproximal one-third of the mGluR1α C terminus (GST-mGluR1α-Cprox).We performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay comparing the PKCphosphorylation of wild-type GST-mGluR1α-Cprox andGST-mGluR1α-Cprox mutants. Interestingly, the phosphopeptide map formGluR1α-Cprox D854A and mGluR1α-Cprox D854T revealed theappearance of a new phosphopeptide (Fig.2E). To confirm that the new phosphopeptide was theresult of the phosphorylation of Ser-853, we made a double mutation, includingboth S853A and D854A (GST-mGluR1α-Cprox S853A/D854A). PKCphosphorylation of this fusion protein resulted in a peptide map lacking thecritical phosphopeptide and resembling the peptide map of wild-typemGluR1α (Fig.2E). These results strongly suggest that the endogenousaspartic acid (Asp-854 of mGluR1α) affects the phosphorylation of theadjacent residue on mGluR1α (Ser-853), just as the adjacent threonine oraspartic acid affects the phosphorylation of Ser-839 on mGluR5. Our data, thus far, was entirely consistent with the direct phosphorylationof Ser-839 on mGluR5 by PKC and an absence of PKC phosphorylation of Thr-840.However, we wanted to explore the possibility that certain isoforms of PKCmight preferentially phosphorylate Thr-840 or other nearby residues inaddition to Ser-839. All of our phosphorylation assays had used a PKC mixturethat consisted predominantly of α, β, and γ PKC. We thereforeextended our analyses using a battery of PKC isoforms to phosphorylatewild-type GST-mGluR5-Cprox or GST-mGluR5-Cprox (S839A)(Fig. 3). We found that thephosphopeptide maps derived from the phosphorylation assays of different PKCisoforms were quite similar, indicating that most of the PKC phosphorylationsites could be phosphorylated by several different isoforms of PKC.Interestingly, many of the PKC isoforms phosphorylated the peptide containingSer-839 and Thr-840 (Fig.3A), with PKCα, PKCγ, and PKCθ beingmost efficient. In contrast, PKCδ, -ϵ, and -ζ did not appearto phosphorylate Ser-839 at all. It should be noted that our experiments onlyaddressed the differential specificity of the PKC isoforms in vitroand therefore do not necessarily reflect isoform specificity in vivo,where other factors, such as compartmentalization, may also play a criticalrole. However, importantly, the same peptide fragment was never phosphorylatedby any PKC isoform when Ser-839 was mutated to alanine(Fig. 3B). These datademonstrated that Ser-839 was the only residue within the peptide that wasphosphorylated by the variety of PKC isoforms tested. Under no conditions wasThr-840, or any other nearby residue, contained within that particular trypticpeptide, phosphorylated by these same PKC isoforms. These data further confirmthe specificity of the PKC phosphorylation of serine 839. If PKC phosphorylation of Ser-839 is critical for mGluR5-elicitedCa2+ oscillations, then the S839A mutation should alterCa2+ transients elicited by mGluR5 activation. To investigate this,we expressed full-length mGluR5 wild type or mutants in HeLa cells, andchanges in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in response to agonistapplication (500 μm glutamate, 250 s) were analyzed using aconfocal microscope. The intracellular Ca2+ transients wereclassified as oscillating (representative response,Fig. 4A), ornon-oscillating (see “Experimental Procedures”)(8Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R.

However,consistent with our finding that it is Ser-839 and not Thr-840 phosphorylationthat is important for regulating Ca2+ signaling, T840A (which ispermissive for Ser-839 phosphorylation) exhibited Ca2+ oscillationsthat were indistinguishable from mGluR5 wild-type Ca2+ responses(Fig. 4B). Thusphosphorylation of Ser-839 is the critical molecular determinant for theCa2+ oscillations induced by mGluR5 activation. Previous studies (8Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R.

For example,using several PKC inhibitors, Kawabata et al.(9Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hayashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J.

Therefore, we alsoinvestigated the PKC dependence of mGluR5-elicited Ca2+oscillations, specifically comparing wild-type mGluR5 to mGluR5 T840A. Cellsexpressing mGluR5 T840A were treated with PMA for 12 h to down-regulate PKCactivity (8Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35947-35960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Under theseconditions, both mGluR5 wild-type and mGluR5 T840A no longer consistentlyproduced Ca2+ oscillations (Fig.5), further confirming that PKC phosphorylation of Thr-840 is notthe essential PKC event regulating Ca2+ oscillations. Many studies have implicated PKC as an important regulator of mGluR5function (10Kawabata S. Tsutusmi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,14Macek T.A. Schaffhauser H. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6138-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Francesconi A.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).One of the most convincing examples of PKC regulating mGluR signaling is thatof mGluR5-mediated Ca2+ oscillations. The activation of the Group 1metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR1α and mGluR5, results inintracellular Ca2+ release, but mGluR5 activation is unique in thatit triggers Ca2+ oscillations. It is known that the proximal regionof the mGluR5 C terminus is the critical determinant regulating theCa2+ oscillations, and until now, it has been widely accepted thatPKC phosphorylation of Thr-840 within that region of mGluR5 was the essentialmechanism(8Nash M.S.

Neurosci. 2004; 20: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).This is based on mutagenesis data in which altering Thr-840 to aspartic acidperturbs mGluR5 Ca2+ oscillations. We have used biochemicalphosphorylation assays to specifically characterize the PKC phosphorylation ofthe portion of the mGluR5 C terminus surrounding Thr-840. Strikingly, we foundthat Thr-840 is not a PKC substrate, and its phosphorylation does not play anyrole in the PKC regulation of mGluR5-elicited Ca2+ oscillations.Instead, an adjacent residue, Ser-839, is directly phosphorylated by PKC, andphosphorylation of this residue regulates mGluR5-dependent Ca2+oscillations. Although Thr-840 is not directly phosphorylated, both our study and that ofKawabata et al. (10Kawabata S. Tsutusmi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar)show that a threonine residue at the 840 position, not an aspartic acid, isessential for mGluR5-elicited Ca2+ oscillations. We thendemonstrated that this could be attributed to a permissive or structural rolefor Thr-840 in allowing the phosphorylation of Ser-839 on mGluR5. Although theoriginal study by Kawabata et al. used peptide map analysis toanalyze the phosphorylation of the critical region of mGluR5, they neverevaluated the T840A mutation. This experiment would have revealed that Thr-840was not the residue directly phosphorylated by PKC. We also showed that the analogous residue Asp-854 in mGluR1α inhibitsthe PKC phosphorylation of the conserved serine in mGluR1α, Ser-853.When mGluR1α Asp-854 is mutated to a permissive residue, D854A, weobserved PKC phosphorylation of Ser-853. These findings are entirelyconsistent with the original findings in which activation of mGluR5 containingthe T840D mutation resulted in mGluR1α-like intracellular calciumrelease, and activation of mGluR1α containing the D854T mutationresulted in mGluR5-like Ca2+ oscillations. Although our experiments are the first to demonstrate that Thr-840 is notdirectly phosphorylated by PKC, other studies suggest that Thr-840 may not bea substrate for PKC. For example, the T840A and T840D mutations in mGluR5 havebeen reported to differentially regulate PKC oscillation patterns upon mGluR5activation (7Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Bhattacharya M. Kelvin D.J. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35900-35908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,21Uchino M. Sakai N. Kashiwagi K. Shirai Y. Shinohara Y. Hirose K. Iino M. Yamamura T. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2254-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results cannot beexplained by the direct phosphorylation of Thr-840 on mGluR5 by PKC (or lackof phosphorylation of serine 854 of mGluR1α), because both of thesemutations would abolish phosphorylation of this particular residue and wouldbe predicted to have similar phenotypes. However, in neither study was analternative mechanism for PKC regulation of mGluR5 signaling identified. Ourfindings that PKC directly phosphorylates Ser-839 and that Thr-840 ispermissive for Ser-839 phosphorylation are consistent with these reports andreconcile much of the data found in the literature. Taken together, these dataare consistent with a role for PKC phosphorylation of Ser-839 specificallyregulating mGluR5-elicited Ca2+ (and perhaps PKC andIP3) oscillations. We used an in vitro phosphorylation assay followed byphosphopeptide map analyses to determine that Ser-839 is phosphorylated by PKCbut that Thr-840 is not. Initially we used a PKC mixture that consistedpredominantly of α, β, and γ isoforms in all of ourphosphorylation assays. However, we wanted to explore the possibility thatparticular PKC isoforms might preferentially phosphorylate Ser-839 or Thr-840.A recent study reported that PKCδ specifically phosphorylates Thr-840,although no biochemical assays of phosphorylation were conducted(21Uchino M. Sakai N. Kashiwagi K. Shirai Y. Shinohara Y. Hirose K. Iino M. Yamamura T. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2254-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To address thepossibility that specific isoforms might preferentially phosphorylate Thr-840,we used a battery of PKC isoforms to phosphorylate wild-type GST-mGluR5-Cproxor GST-mGluR5-Cprox (S839A) (Fig.3). We found that Thr-840 was not phosphorylated by any of the PKCisoforms used in our assay, including PKCδ. Once again these datasupported a purely permissive or structural role for Thr-840 in allowingSer-839 to be a substrate for PKC phosphorylation. Finally, to explore whetherthe mGluR5 T840A Ca2+ oscillations were PKC-dependent, we treatedcells expressing mGluR5 T840A with PMA for a prolonged period of time todown-regulate PKC. We found that PKC down-regulation inhibited theoscillations. Thus, mGluR5 T840A-elicited Ca2+ oscillations wereindeed PKC-dependent, consistent with PKC directly phosphorylating Ser-839 andnot Thr-840. Our results clearly demonstrated a central role for the PKC phosphorylationof Ser-839 in regulating mGluR5 Ca2+ oscillations in heterologouscells. Furthermore, our studies revealed a unique substrate-specificphosphorylation event that differentiates the regulation of the Group 1mGluR-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release. Such a preciselyregulated difference in intracellular signaling between mGluR5 andmGluR1α is extremely provocative, and our studies defining the precisePKC substrate within mGluR5 that is phosphorylated will facilitate morerigorous studies. However, it is also clear that the regulation ofmGluR5-elicited Ca2+ oscillations must be more complicated than thePKC phosphorylation of a single residue. The fact that all responding cells donot oscillate (Fig. 4) lendssupport to the notion that other factors are at play. This is also apparent bythe many complexities in the Group 1 mGluR Ca2+ signalingliterature (8Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol.

The role of Ca2+ oscillations in neurons is not understood,although it is clear that the frequency, duration, and spatial location ofcalcium signals are critical for the precise regulation of signal transductionand gene expression in other cellular systems(26De Koninck P.

Neurosci. 2004; 20: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), making it unclear howCa2+ oscillations in glia and heterologous cells relate toCa2+ transients in neurons. These recent findings suggest that, atleast in Purkinje neurons, the regulation of Ca2+ transients may bemore complex than previously believed and illustrate the importance ofevaluating mGluR signaling in neurons. By precisely characterizing themolecular determinants underlying PKC phosphorylation of mGluR5, our studywill facilitate more vigorous and accurate analyses of mGluR-regulatedCa2+, PKC, and IP3 oscillations in vivo.

IL-6-type cytokines signal either via homodimers of thesignal transducing receptor subunit gp130 or via heterodimeric receptorcomplexes containing gp130 together with the leukemia inhibitory factorreceptor (LIFR) or the OSMR (for a review, see Ref.2Heinrich P.C.

The molecular mechanism of Jak activation upon cytokine stimulation is notunderstood. It is still under debate which functional domains exist in theJaks, and the interplay of these domains in kinase activation is not clear.Based on sequence similarities between the Jaks (molecular masses of120–140 kDa), seven Jak homology (JH) regions have been defined(Fig. 2A) that matchthe more recently predicted domain structure only partially(8Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 751-769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The JH1 domain, aclassical tyrosine kinase domain, is flanked by a non-functional kinasedomain, the pseudokinase domain (JH2) that may play a regulatory role(9Saharinen P. Takaluoma K.

After deletion of incomplete sequences and of sequencespresent more than once, the alignment of the remaining 420 SH2 domainsequences was corrected to meet the structural requirements derived from knownSH2 structures. Cell Culture and Transfection—U4C cells (human fibrosarcomacells kindly provided by Dr. I. M. Kerr, Cancer Research UK, London), COS-7cells (simian kidney cells, ATCC CRL1619) were maintained in Dulbecco'smodified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 10%fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. G418(400 μg/ml) was added to the medium of U4C cells. The U4C-Jak1,U4C-Jak1-YFP, U4C-Jak1-R466K, U4C-Jak1-R466K-YFP, U4C-Jak1-K907E, andU4C-Jak1-L80A/Y81A cells were cultured with 500 μg/ml hygromycin. Cellswere grown at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere at 5%CO2. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was carried out using FuGENE (RocheDiagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer'srecommendations or using DEAE-dextran as described before(33Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar). U4C cells weretransfected using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to themanufacturer's recommendations. U4C cells stably expressing Jak1WT, Jak1R466K,Jak1-YFP, Jak1-R466K-YFP, Jak1-K907E, and Jak1-L80A/Y81A were generated usingthe Flip-In™ T-Rex™ system from Invitrogen according to themanufacturer's recommendations. IFNα, IFNγ, and OSM were obtainedfrom Peprotech. Recombinant IL-6 and sIL-6R were prepared as described(34Arcone R. Pucci P. Zappacosta F. Fontaine V. Malorni A. Marino G. Ciliberto G. Eur.

Cells were stimulatedwith 20 ng/ml OSM, 1000 units/ml IFNγ or IFNα, or with 200 ng/mlIL-6 in combination with 1 μg/ml sIL-6R. Constructs—The pSVL- and pcDNA5/FRT/-constructs Jak1,Jak1-YFP, L80A/Y81A, and L80A/Y81A-YFP were described previously(1Behrmann I. Smyczek T. Heinrich P.C. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Komyod W. Giese B.

Arginine 466 was mutated tolysine using standard PCR techniques. The PCR fragment was introduced intopSVL-Jak1 using the restriction enzymes BspTI/Bsp119I. The constructpSVL-Jak1-R466K-YFP was generated by restricting with the restriction enzymesBglII/SalI and inserting the fragments into pSVL-Jak1-YFP cut with the sameenzymes. The pcDNA5/FRT/plasmids Jak1-K907E, Jak1-R466K, and Jak1-R466K-YFPwere generated by inserting the Jak1-K907E, Jak1-R466K, and Jak1-R466K-YFPcDNA from the pSVL-constructs as a NotI/EcoRV fragment intopcDNA5/FRT/TO© (Invitrogen). For generation of the Jak1 deletion constructs SH2Δ, JH4Δ, andFERMΔ, DNA fragments were generated by standard PCR techniques insertingan in-frame HA-tag followed by a stop codon and a SmaI site after the aminoacid positions Lys558, Glu456, or Cys440,using pSVL-Jak1 as a template. PCR fragments and vector were digested byPstI/SmaI and the relevant fragments inserted. These constructs additionallycontain an ApaI site upstream of the HA-tag and a NotI site directly followingthe stop codon which allows removal of the HA-tag. The constructs J3-SH2-HAand J2-SH2-HA were generated using pSVL-Jak2 and pSVL-Jak3 as templates. DNAfragments encoding amino acids His377–Leu499 ofJak3 and amino acids His401–Ser523 of Jak2 weregenerated by PCR using the relevant primers, the sense primer additionallyinserted an in-frame PstI site followed by DNA encoding amino acidsThr416–Cys440 of Jak1, the reverse primercontained an in-frame ApaI site. The construct pSVL-Jak1-FERMΔ and thePCR fragments were digested by PstI/ApaI, and the fragments were ligated intothe isolated vector. All GFP-tagged Jak1 constructs were generated bydigesting the relevant YFP- or HA-tagged parental constructs with ApaI/NotI,thus removing the tag and inserting a PCR-generated DNA fragment coding forenhanced GFP flanked by the same restriction sites. The GFP-tagged JAKdeletion constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by using theEcoRI/NotI restriction sites. The integrity of all constructs was verified byDNA sequencing using the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer LifeSciences). The gp130 chimera β130 and the OSMR constructβOSMRΔ1 (IL-5Rβ/OSMRΔ1) were described previously(33Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J.

For generation ofGFP-tagged OSMR, a BstEII site was introduced by PCR 3′ to the codon foramino acid C979 allowing in-frame insertion of cDNA for enhanced GFP. Cell Fractionation—All fractionation and centrifugationsteps were performed at 4 °C using ice-cold buffers. Cytoplasmic,membrane, and nuclear fractions were prepared using the protocol described indetail before (1Behrmann I. Smyczek T. Heinrich P.C. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Komyod W. Giese B.

Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western BlotAnalysis—All steps of cell lysis and immunoprecipitation wereperformed at 4 °C using ice-cold buffers. Cells were lysed on the dishwith 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Brij 96 or 1% Triton X-100, 20mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF,1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/mlpepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm EDTA. After incubation ofthe cleared lysates with antibodies, the immunoprecipitates were collectedwith protein A-Sepharose for 1 h, washed several times, and analyzed furtherby SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoridemembrane (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with the respective antibodies.Anti-Jak1 (HR785, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-IL-5Rβ (S16, SantaCruz Biotechnology) were used for immunoprecipitation. Anti-Jak1 (J24320,Transduction Laboratories and HR785, Santa Cruz), anti-HA (MMS-101R,Invitrogen), anti-GFP (Rockland), anti-Lamin-A/C (636, Santa CruzBiotechnology), anti-Calnexin (610523, Transduction Laboratories),anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-STAT3 (610189,Transduction Laboratories), anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) (9131 fromCell signaling), anti-STAT1 (S21120 from Transduction Laboratories), andanti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701) (9171 from Cell signaling) were usedfor detection. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies werepurchased from Dako. Signals were detected using the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences). Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal imaging in living cells wascarried out on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using a water correctedPlan-Apochromat (63×) objective. The LSM 510 is equipped with anargon-ion laser (λ = 458 nm, λ = 488 nm, and λ = 514 nm)and a helium/neon laser (λ = 543 nm) (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The laserwas modulated by an acusto-optical modulator. The beam path of YFP (enhancedyellow fluorescent protein) contained excitation at 514 nm, a main dichroicmirror of 514 nm and a longpass filter of >530 nm. Transfected cells weregrown on 18-mm glass coverslips. 48 h after transfection the cover slips wereplaced in a perfusion chamber that allowed a constant flow with Dulbecco'smodified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/literstreptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. To maintain 37 °C during allimage acquisition, the perfusion chamber and the objective were thermostatted.For qualitative cell imaging, a laser power of 35% of 25 milliwatt was used.The transmission and detector gains were set to achieve best signals. Flow Cytometry—Cells were resuspended in cold PBSsupplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.1% sodium azide (PBS/azide). 5× 105 to 1 × 106 cells in 100 μl ofPBS/azide were incubated with 1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-MHC-I (W6/32, Sigma),anti-OSMR (ANA2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-IL5Rβ (S16, Santa CruzBiotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with coldPBS/azide. To visualize the bound antibodies, the cells were subsequentlyincubated in darkness with a 1/100 dilution of a R-phycoerythrin-conjugatedanti-mouse IgG-Fab (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cellswere again washed with cold PBS-azide, and then 104 cells persample were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences)equipped with a 488 nm argon laser. The Members of the Janus Kinase Family Contain a Divergent SH2Domain—To determine whether the potential SH2 domain of Januskinases possesses the features required for proper recognition ofphosphotyrosine motifs, we performed a structural alignment of 25 SH2sequences of Janus kinases with the sequences of structurally explored SH2domains of other proteins (Fig.1). To better evaluate the variability of the different amino acidpositions, an additional alignment of 420 SH2 domain sequences excluding theJanus kinases was generated (data not shown). Residues conserved in SH2domains to at least 30 or 90% are indicated inFig. 1 in blue andred, respectively. We found that critical residues involved in thehydrophobic core of the domain (e.g. positions αA9, βB2,βB3, βB4, βC3, βC5, βD7, αB2, and αB5)are strictly conserved in the 420 SH2 domains (hydrophobic amino acid sidechains in 100% of the 420 SH2 sequences) as well as in all the Jaks(highlighted by an h in Fig.1). Furthermore, secondary structure prediction analysis of theJanus kinase family members revealed the typical secondary structure patternfound in SH2 domains (data not shown). For functionality, SH2 domains dependon the arginine residue at position βB5, which contacts the phosphategroup of a binding phosphotyrosine motif. Accordingly, this residue waspresent in 419 sequences (99.8%) in our alignment of 420 reference SH2 domainsequences, highlighting the strict requirement for this amino acid at thisposition. Strikingly, this arginine is not equally well conserved in all theJaks. Whereas this residue is present in all the sequences of Jak1 and Jak3,it is exchanged to glutamine in one Jak2 sequence (puffer fish) and none ofthe Tyk2 sequences contains an arginine at this position (histidine in humans,glutamine in mouse, and cysteine in puffer fish). Thus, considering all theJaks, there is a striking discrepancy of conservation between structural(conserved in all) and functional residues (conserved in only some Jaks).While this finding precludes a general requirement of the SH2 domain in Januskinases, the fact that the crucial arginine is conserved in all Jak1 sequencesmay suggest that the SH2 domain may play a role in Jak1-mediated signaltransduction. We therefore decided to generate a non-functional SH2 mutant ofJak1. Mutation of Arg466 to Lysine Has No Effect onJak1/Cytokine-Receptor Binding and Up-regulation of SurfaceExpression of the OSM Receptor—To investigate the effects of anon-functional SH2 domain within Jak1, we introduced an arginine to lysinemutation at position βB5 (amino acid 466) of Jak1(Fig. 2A). First, wechecked whether the mutation of this residue would affect Jak1/receptorbinding. Due to low endogenous protein levels and lack of sufficientlyefficient antibodies against gp130 or OSMR the Jak/receptor binding wasinvestigated by transiently expressing Jak1 constructs and a chimericIL-5Rβ/gp130-construct in COS-7 cells as described before(11Haan C. Is'harc H. Hermanns H.M. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Grötzinger J. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37451-37458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To monitor Jak1association, the chimeric receptors were immunoprecipitated with anIL-5Rβ-specific antibody and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting(Fig. 2B).Coprecipitated Jak1 was detected using a Jak1-specific antibody. As describedpreviously (11Haan C. Is'harc H. Hermanns H.M. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Grötzinger J. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37451-37458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), theIL-5Rβ/gp130 constructs efficiently bound wild-type Jak1, whereasassociation of the non-binding mutant Jak1-L80A/Y81A was greatly impaired. Thesingle amino acid exchange of the phosphotyrosine-binding residue in the Jak1SH2 domain arginine 466 to lysine did not affect Jak association to the gp130cytoplasmic part (Fig.2B). The same results were obtained using anIL-5Rβ/OSMR-construct (data not shown). Since the Jak1 N terminus comprising the FERM and the SH2 domains isinvolved in cytokine receptor binding, and since Jak association to the OSMRhas recently been shown to promote an up-regulation of the surface expressionof this receptor (6Radtke S. Hermanns H.M. Haan C. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Gascan H. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11297-11305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), wehypothesized that the SH2 domain might play a role in the latter process. Uponcoexpression of a GFP-tagged OSMR with different Jak mutants in COS-7 cells,both Jak1 and Jak1-R466K efficiently up-regulated the OSM receptor, whileJak1-L80A/Y81A, the non-receptor-binding mutant, failed to do so(Fig. 2C). Thus, thenon-functional Jak1 SH2 domain mutant, Jak1-R466K, does not only have theability to bind to cytokine receptors like wild-type Jak1 but also retains theability to promote surface expression of the OSMR. Mutation of Arginine 466 to Lysine Has No Effect on the SubcellularDistribution of Jak1—Jak membrane localization was recently shownto be dependent on cytokine receptor binding(1Behrmann I. Smyczek T. Heinrich P.C. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Komyod W. Giese B. Müller-Newen G. Haan S. Haan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35486-35493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To examine whether a lowlevel constitutive phosphotyrosine/SH2 domain interaction could have an effecton Jak localization, we investigated the localization of Jak1, Jak1-R466K, andJak1-L80A/Y81A in stably transfected U4C cells by using cell fractionationtechniques (Fig. 3A).Jak1-L80A/Y81A was used as control, since it is known to be localized to thecytoplasm (1Behrmann I. Smyczek T. Heinrich P.C. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Komyod W. Giese B. Müller-Newen G. Haan S. Haan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35486-35493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cells werefractionated and Jak1 was detected by Western blot analysis. The blots werecounter-stained with antibodies against marker proteins of the differentsubcellular fractions. Calnexin was used as membrane fraction marker andlamins A and C as nuclear marker proteins. Cytoplasmic proteins have beendefined as those soluble after 1h ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g. A predominant membrane localization was found for Jak1 andJak1-R466K, while the non-receptor-binding control Jak1-L80A/Y81A was mainlyfound in the cytoplasm. Thus, the localization of the non-functional SH2mutant Jak1-R466K is identical to the localization of wild-type Jak1. As a second independent assay to show Jak localization, yellow fluorescentfusion proteins of Jak1 and Jak1-R466K were generated(Fig. 3B) and stablyexpressed in U4C cells. Importantly, the YFP-tag does not interfere with Jak1signaling capacity as previously demonstrated(1Behrmann I. Smyczek T. Heinrich P.C. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Komyod W. Giese B. Müller-Newen G.

Fluorescence of both Jak1-YFP andJak1-R466K-YFP is concentrated at the plasma membrane, as described previouslyfor Jak1-YFP (1Behrmann I. Smyczek T. Heinrich P.C. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Komyod W.

There are several lines of evidence that support the presence of nAChRs inmammalian sperm. α-Bungarotoxin has been shown earlier to inhibitmotility in sperm, and its binding sites were localized to the head and tailof sperm(29Placzek R. Krassnigg F. Schill W.B. Arch. Androl. 1988; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Nelson L. Exp. CellRes. 1976; 101: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Young R.J.

Bacetti, personal communication.have shown that nicotinic receptor-like molecules are present in thepost-acrosomal and mid-piece region of the rabbit, ram, and human sperm.Partial transcripts for the α5, α7, and β4 subunits have beendetected in human testis (NCBI data base). The mammalian acrosome reaction (AR), a modified exocytotic event involvingfusion of the outer membrane of the sperm head secretory granule-likeorganelle known as the acrosome with the overlying plasma membrane, is anessential step in fertilization(33Yudin A.I. Gottlieb W. Meizel S. Gamete Res. 1988; 20: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,34Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Physiology ofReproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Recent studies have shownthe importance of sperm nAChRs to the AR. It is generally accepted that the ARis initiated in vivo by the glycoprotein ZP3 (ZPC) found in the eggenvelope known as the zona pellucida(34Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Physiology ofReproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Bray et al.(35Bray C. Son J.H. Meizel S. Biol.

Biol.Reprod. 2003; 68: 1348-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have used the nAChRantagonists α-bungarotoxin, α-conotoxin IMI, andmethyllycaconitine to show that a receptor containing the α7 subunit(α7nAChR) is involved in the AR. These antagonists inhibited the ARinitiated by acetylcholine in mouse and human sperm, by the mouse egg envelopein mouse sperm, and by recombinant human ZP3 in human sperm. The current study was undertaken to further characterize the nAChRs inhuman sperm, including the presence and localization of nAChR subunits andsignaling molecules associated with them.

All other reagents were obtained from standard sources and wereof the highest purity available. Human Sperm Preparation and Capacitation—Protocols for humansperm studies were approved by the Human Subjects Committee at the Universityof California, Davis. Semen samples were obtained by masturbation from a poolof healthy donors. A population of >95% motile sperm was obtained bycentrifugation of semen samples through a discontinuous Percoll gradient andsubsequent washing as described previously(37Thomas P. Meizel S. GameteRes. 1988; 20: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For capacitation, thewashed sperm were diluted to 6 × 106 sperm/ml in a mediumcontaining a balanced salt solution, 26 mg/ml BSA, 25 mmbicarbonate, metabolites (lactate, pyruvate, and glucose), and antibiotics(penicillin and streptomycin) and capacitated by incubation of 500-μlaliquots in 15-ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5%CO2/air atmosphere(37Thomas P.

All Western blots andimmunolocalizations using these antibodies shown in the present report arerepresentative of at least three separate experiments. α-Conotoxin IMI-Sepharose Batch Affinity Purification of thenAChRs—The sperm preparations were obtained by Percoll gradientcentrifugation and washed with medium containing 1 mg/ml PVA as describedpreviously (42Sabeur K. Edwards D.P. Meizel S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The finalpellet was resuspended in medium A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150mm NaCl, plus the protease inhibitors 1 mm EDTA, 20μm leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 mmbenzamidine HCl, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm E-64)and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at a sperm concentration of 250 ×106 cells/ml. The sperm suspensions were incubated on ice for 1 hand centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. NHS-α-conotoxinIMI-Sepharose slurry was prepared by linking 2 μmol of α-conotoxinIMI/ml of NHS-activated Sepharose, per the manufacturer's protocol (AmershamBiosciences). Briefly, 40 μl of 50% NHS-Sepharose slurry was activated bywashing in cold 1 mm HCl, washed once with 0.1 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3 (binding buffer), andincubated overnight at 4 °C with α-conotoxin IMI. The beads werewashed three times with binding buffer and incubated with 0.2 mglycine, pH 8.0, overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four timeswith binding buffer alternating with wash buffer (0.1 m acetate,0.5 m NaCl, pH 4.0) and then washed twice with medium A plus 1%(v/v) Triton X-100. The supernatant obtained after Triton X-100 extraction ofsperm was incubated with NHS-α-conotoxin IMI slurry for 6 h at 4 °Cand spun at 500 × g. The pellet was washed three times withmedium A and resuspended in LDS sample buffer. The sample was boiled for 3 minand loaded onto a 7% precast NuPAGE Tris acetate gel, and Western blotanalysis was performed as described below. Preparation of Detergent-resistant Membranes—Human sperm wasprepared by Percoll density gradient, and one-half of the sperm sample wascapacitated under the conditions described above. The other half of the samplewas treated as uncapacitated sperm. Both the uncapacitated and capacitatedsperm samples were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4,and the detergent-resistant membranes were prepared as described previously(43Marchand S. Devillers-Thiery A. Pons S. Changeux J.P. Cartaud J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8891-8901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications.Sperm pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of 50 mm MES, pH 6.5,0.15 m NaCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors asdescribed above for medium A. The cells were solubilized for 20 min at 4°C, homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce tight-fitting homogenizer, andpassed five times through a 22-gauge needle. The homogenates were adjusted to40% sucrose in MES plus protease inhibitors in a final volume of 1 ml, placedat the bottom of a 4-ml ultracentrifuge tube, and overlaid with 1 ml of 30%sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose. The gradients were centrifuged at 42,000 rpmfor 20 h in an SW60 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). 500-μlfractions were collected from the top and added to the α-conotoxin IMIslurry prepared as described above and analyzed by Western blotting asdescribed below. Immunoprecipitation of SRC and FYN—For immunoprecipitationof the kinases, the supernatant from the Triton X-100 extraction of ∼75× 106 cells (as described above) was pre-cleared (to removeproteins that bind nonspecifically to protein A) by incubating the lysate with25 μl of 50% protein A for 1 h at 4 °C and then spun at 10,000 ×g for 2 min. Then 1 μg of antibody was added to the supernatant,and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, a 25-μlaliquot of the immobilized protein A (50% slurry) was added, and thesuspension was further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then spun at 10,000× g for 30 s. The pellet was washed three times with medium Aand resuspended in LDS sample buffer. The sample was boiled for 3 min andloaded onto a 7% precast NuPAGE Tris acetate gel, and Western blot analysiswas performed as described below. Western Blot Analysis—For analysis of total sperm lysate,sperm preparations were obtained by Percoll gradient centrifugation and washed(all solutions without BSA but with 1 mg/ml PVA) as described previously(42Sabeur K. Edwards D.P. Meizel S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The final pellet wasresuspended in LDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The suspension waspassed through a 22-gauge needle and spun at 10,000 × g for 10min. For immunoblotting, the supernatant was loaded onto a 7% Tris acetategel, and the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane at 100 mAconstant current for 2 h. The membrane was blocked for 2 h with 3% BSA in TBST(10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) foranti-α7 antibody or 5% Blotto in TBST for all other antibodies and thenincubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:5000 dilution of primary antibodydiluted in blocking buffer. The membrane was washed three times with TBST andincubated with a 1:2000 dilution of sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbitantibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Themembrane was subsequently washed extensively with TBST and developed using theAmersham Biosciences ECL kit using Hyperfilm ECL. The films were scanned usinga flatbed scanner (Canoscan N1240U, Canon Inc., Lake Success, NY), and AdobePhotoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) was used to crop and adjust theintensity levels to optimize contrast. Immunolocalization of the Subunits of Acetylcholine Receptor, c-SRC,and FYN—For immunolocalization experiments, uncapacitated andcapacitated human sperm were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (forα7, rapsyn, α3, α5, and α9 subunits, and c-SRC sc-18)or with 1% PFA (for β4 subunit, c-SRC, and FYN) for 10 min at roomtemperature. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, andplated on poly-l-lysine-coated slides. The cells were allowed tostick for 15 min, washed twice with PBS, incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for5 min, and washed four times at 5 min each with PBS. The slides were thenblocked with 0.2% gelatin in PBS for 2 h and incubated overnight at 4 °Cwith primary antibody: 100 μg/ml of mAb306, 100 μg/ml of controlα-115 antibody; 1:500 dilution of rap1579 antibody; 1:250 dilution ofα3, α5, and α9 subunit antibodies; 1:500 dilution of β4antibody; and 50 μg/ml of c-SRC sc18, c-SRC, and FYN antibodies. The slideswere then washed with PBS, incubated for 1 h with 6 μg/ml FITC-rabbitanti-mouse IgG or 10 μg/ml FITC-goat anti-rabbit IgG, and then washed asdescribed above. The slides were then dried and mounted with Vectashield, andsperm was examined using a Nikon E800 epifluorescence microscope at ×1000 magnification equipped with Q imaging and a digital Retiga 1300i camera.Adobe Photoshop was used to crop the images, and the intensity levels ofexperimental and control were adjusted equally to optimize contrast. We also compared α7 subunit localization before and after treatmentwith an AR initiator, the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Capacitatedsperm were incubated with 3 μm ionomycin for 5 min as describedpreviously (44Pillai M.C. Meizel S. J.Exp. Zool. 1991; 258: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). At the end ofthe reaction, 5-μl aliquots were removed to check for motility(37Thomas P. Meizel S. GameteRes. 1988; 20: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). One-half of the spermwere stained with mAb306 antibody for localization of the receptor asdescribed above, and the remaining sperm were assessed for acrosomal statususing concanavalin A-FITC(45Meizel S. Turner K.O. Mol.Reprod. Dev. 1993; 34: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We also comparedα7 subunit localization before and after treatment with cytochalasin D.Capacitated sperm were treated with 20 μm cytochalasin D aninhibitor of actin polymerization for 3 h as described previously(46Brener E. Rubinstein S. Cohen G. Shternall K. Rivlin J. Breitbart H. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and sperm were thenstained with mAb306 antibody for localization of the receptor as describedabove. We identified regions of localization on the basis of well establisheddescriptions of human sperm morphology(47Fawcett D.W. Dev.Biol. 1975; 44: 394-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Preparation of α-Conotoxin IMI-Rhodamine Conjugate andLocalization with the Conjugate—Preparation of theα-conotoxin IMI-rhodamine conjugate was performed as describedpreviously for conjugation of proteins to fluorescent probes(48Brinkley M. BioconjugateChem. 1992; 3: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar,49Bark S.J. Hahn K.M. Methods. 2000; 20: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 μmol ofice-cold α-conotoxin IMI was added dropwise with mixing to 1 μmol ofice-cold NHS-rhodamine in 0.1 m KPO4, pH 7.0, in a150-μl reaction mixture and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. Theconjugate was partially purified on a Sephadex G-15 (25 × 1 cm) columnequilibrated in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.0. Fractions (1ml each) were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the fractions in thevoid volume that had the peak 214 nm absorbance were pooled and lyophilized.The conjugate was resuspended in 250 μl of PBS, pH 7.4, and checked by massspectrometry for labeling (Molecular Structure Facility, University ofCalifornia, Davis). The molecular mass was ∼1763 Da as expected. For localization with the conjugate, the cells were fixed with either 2 or4% PFA, and 1:100 dilution of the conjugate was added followed by overnightincubation at 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS and mounted asdescribed above for the immunolocalization of receptor subunits. For control,the cells were incubated with the conjugate together with 2.5 μmunlabeled α-conotoxin IMI. Localization withα-bungarotoxin-rhodamine conjugate was performed as described earlier(32Baccetti B. Burrini A.G. Collodel G. Falugi C. Moretti E. Piomboni P. Zygote. 1995; 3: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with modifications.Briefly, capacitated sperm were fixed with either 2 or 4% PFA, and 5 μg/mlof conjugate was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. For control, thecells were first preincubated for 2 h with 50 μg/ml unlabeledα-bungarotoxin. The cells were rinsed with PBS and mounted as describedabove, and the images were processed as described above forimmunolocalization. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Lavendustin A and PP2 Treatment of Sperm andAR Assay—Sperm samples were prepared and capacitated underconditions described above. Aliquots of capacitated sperm (100 μl each)were first preincubated with either lavendustin A or PP2 or with theirinactive analogs lavendustin B or PP3, respectively, for 5 min followed by theaddition of 250 μm acetylcholine and further incubation for 10min. The reaction was stopped by adding 4% formaldehyde, and at least 200sperm per sample were assessed for acrosomal status in a blind fashion usingconcanavalin A-FITC (45Meizel S. Turner K.O. Mol.Reprod. Dev. 1993; 34: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ARpercentage data were transformed to the arcsine of their square roots. TheDuncan new multiple range test was used to compare group mean differences, andstatistical significance was determined at p < 0.05. Presence of α7 Subunit and Its Association with theCytoskeleton—A 57 ± 1.2-kDa α7 subunit was detected inthe human sperm extracts by Western blotting, afterNHS-Sepharose-α-conotoxin IMI batch affinity purification(Fig. 1, panel a, lane1). No protein bound to the NHS-Sepharose control(Fig. 1, panel a, lane2). Immunofluorescence experiments using an α7 subunit-specific antibodyshowed that this subunit was localized in the neck region and posteriorpost-acrosomal region in both uncapacitated and capacitated sperm(Fig. 1, panels b andc, respectively). No signal was detected when using a controlantibody or when the primary antibody was omitted(Fig. 1, panels d ande, respectively). To test if there was a change in localization afterthe AR, capacitated sperm were treated with ionomycin and then immunostained.The percentages of sperm acrosome reacted in those experiments were asfollows: 33.1 ± 2.8 and 11.6 ± 0.23 for ionomycin andMe2SO-treated sperm, respectively (n = 3). The motilityand quality of the sperm were ∼75% and 3, respectively, for bothionomycin-treated and control sperm. No change in the localization of theα7 subunit was observed in acrosome-reacted sperm samples(Fig. 1, panel g)compared with its Me2SO-treated control(Fig. 1, panel f). To determine whether the sperm α7 subunit was present in lipid rafts,membrane fractions from a sucrose density step gradient of uncapacitated andcapacitated sperm were purified by α-conotoxin IMI affinity purificationand analyzed by Western blotting. In uncapacitated sperm, the α7 subunitwas present in the 5% low density membrane fraction 2(Fig. 1, panel h). Incapacitated sperm, the α7 subunit was absent in the low densityfractions but present in the high density membrane fractions(Fig. 1, panel i). To test whether actin was involved in the immobility of the α7subunit, capacitated sperm were treated with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor ofactin polymerization. This treatment led to a very diffuse localization of thereceptor (Fig. 1, panelk) compared with its Me2SO-treated control(Fig. 1, panel j). Western blotting of whole sperm cell lysates showed the presence of rapsyn,which runs at the expected molecular mass"
https://openalex.org/W2013666484,"Defensins are cationic antimicrobial mini-proteins that play important roles in the innate immune defense against microbial infection. Six invariant Cys residues in each defensin form three structurally indispensable intramolecular disulfide bridges. The only other residue invariant in all known mammalian defensins is a Gly. Structural studies indicate that the invariant Gly residue is located in an atypical, classic-type β-bulge with the backbone torsion angles (ϕ, Ψ) disallowed for l-amino acids but permissible for d-enantiomers. We replaced the invariant Gly17 residue in human neutrophil α-defensin 2 (HNP2) by l-Ala or one of the d-amino acids Ala, Glu, Phe, Arg, Thr, Val, or Tyr. Although l-Ala17-HNP2 could not be folded, resulting in massive aggregation, all of the d-amino acid-substituted analogs folded with high efficiency. The high resolution x-ray crystal structures of dimeric d-Ala17-HNP2 were determined in three different crystal forms, showing a well preserved β-bulge identical to those found in other defensins. The seven d-analogs of HNP2 exhibited highly variable bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative test strains, consistent with the premise that interplay between charge and hydrophobicity dictates how amphiphilic defensins kill. Further, the bactericidal activity of these d-amino acid analogs of HNP2 correlated well with their ability to induce leakage from large unilamellar vesicles, supporting membrane permeabilization as the lethal event in microbial killing by HNP2. Our findings identify a conformational prerequisite in the β-bulge of defensins essential for correct folding and native structure, thereby explaining the molecular basis of the Gly-Xaa-Cys motif conserved in all mammalian defensins.

Our findings identify a conformational prerequisite in the β-bulge of defensins essential for correct folding and native structure, thereby explaining the molecular basis of the Gly-Xaa-Cys motif conserved in all mammalian defensins. A β-bulge is defined as a region between two consecutive β-type hydrogen bonds, that includes two or more residues on one strand opposite a single residue on the other strand (1Richardson J.S. Getzoff E.D. Richardson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2574-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 2Chan A.W. Hutchinson E.G. Harris D. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1574-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Found primarily in anti-parallel β-sheets, β-bulges occur commonly, on average twice per protein (2Chan A.W. Hutchinson E.G. Harris D. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1574-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The extra residue(s) on the bulged strand not only disrupts the normal alternation of side chain direction but also impacts the directionality of β-strands and accentuates the typical right-handed twist of β-sheets (1Richardson J.S. Getzoff E.D. Richardson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2574-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 2Chan A.W. Hutchinson E.G. Harris D. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1574-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For these reasons, β-bulges are often well conserved in proteins. However, the underlying molecular basis for the formation of β-bulges in proteins remains poorly understood. Carefully selected model protein systems provide valuable tools in elucidating the functional implications of the occurrence of these irregular secondary structural elements, thus likely shedding light on protein de novo design. In this respect, mammalian defensins are a suitable example.Mammalian defensins are a family of cationic and Cys-rich antimicrobial mini-proteins expressed predominantly in leukocytes and epithelial cells (3Lehrer R.I. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 4Ganz T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). They form part of the first line of defense in the innate immune arsenal against pathogens, killing a broad range of microbes primarily through membrane disruption. In addition, defensins function as effective immune modulators in adaptive immunity by activating certain types of immune cells via receptor-mediated signaling pathways (5Biragyn A. Ruffini P.A.

Characteristic of the overall fold is a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet constrained by three disulfide bonds. A sequence alignment of known α-defensins from human, mouse, rhesus macaque, rabbit, guinea pig, and rat (Fig. 1) reveals seven conserved residues, the six Cys residues and the glycyl residue located within the second β-strand of the molecule. Separated by a variable residue (Xaa), the invariant Gly and the fourth Cys constitute the sequence motif Gly-Xaa-Cys, which is also conserved in all known mammalian β-defensins, as well as in other broader classes of antimicrobial peptides (16Yount N.Y. Yeaman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7363-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Collectively, the structural studies of several α- and β-defensins show that the Gly residue is part of the conserved β-bulge (17Zimmermann G.R. Legault P. Selsted M.E. Pardi A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13663-13671Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).We have recently solved high resolution crystal structures of human neutrophil α-defensin 4 and human epithelial α-defensins 5 and 6, also known as HNP4, HD5, and HD6, respectively. 4A. Szyk, Z. Wu, K. Tucker, D. Yang, W. Lu, and J. Lubkowski, manuscript in preparation.4A. Szyk, Z. Wu, K. Tucker, D. Yang, W. Lu, and J. Lubkowski, manuscript in preparation. Structural analysis of HNP4, HD5, and HD6 indicates that the invariant glycyl residue (Gly17 in HNP1) adopts the backbone dihedral angles (ϕ, Ψ) centered around ϕ = 170° and Ψ = -150° in the Ramachandran diagram (Fig. 2) (18Ramakrishnan C. Ramachandran G.N. Biophys. J. 1965; 5: 909-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). These torsion angles are rarely observed for l-amino acid residues but are energetically preferable for d-enantiomers (19Mitchell J.B. Smith J. Proteins. 2003; 50: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that the glycyl residue is conserved in mammalian α-defensins because of the stringent structural requirement for β-bulges that cannot be met by any l-amino acids with restricted backbone conformational space. Furthermore, substitutions of d-amino acids for the invariant glycyl residue in mammalian α-defensins can be structurally tolerated. Because antimicrobial peptides kill microorganisms by mechanisms independent of stereospecific molecular recognition (20Wade D. Boman A. Wahlin B. Drain C.M. Andreu D. Boman H.G. Merrifield R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 21Shai Y. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), we predicted that d-amino acids in place of the conserved Gly in defensins will be functionally allowed. The current report integrated biochemical, structural, and functional approaches to investigate whether or not the conserved β-bulge in mammalian defensins can be reconstructed through d-amino acid substitutions without structural and functional consequences.FIGURE 2The (ϕ, Ψ) angles of all amino acid residues from HNP4, HD5, and HD6 plotted on a conventional Ramachandran diagram (18Ramakrishnan C.

Analytical RP-HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1100 series system equipped with a Waters Symmetry 300™ analytical C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm). Solvents used for HPLC purification were water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analyses were conducted on a Micromass ZQ-4000 single quadruple mass spectrometer. Samples were suspended in methanol:water:acetic acid (49:49:2) and infused by a syringe pump at 10 μl/min. Peptides were quantified spectroscopically at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients calculated according to a published algorithm (26Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar).Oxidative Folding—The protocol of oxidative folding for HNP2 analogs was essentially as described previously (23Wu Z. Powell R. Lu W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2402-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Reduced purified peptides were first dissolved at 1 mg/ml in 8 m urea containing 12 mm reduced and 1.2 mm oxidized glutathione, followed by a 4-fold dilution into a dimethylformamide solution (33% v/v) buffered to pH 8.3. The air-tight folding reaction proceeded at room temperature with gentle stirring. 40 μl was withdrawn periodically for analysis on HPLC, and peak integration was performed to quantify time-dependent folding yields. Folded HNP2 analogs were purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC and their molecular masses ascertained by ESI-MS.Determination of the disulfide topology in d-Ala17-HNP2 was performed according to the published procedures (27Wu Z.

Powell R. Ericksen B. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Pept. Res. 2003; 62: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A complete tryptic/chymotryptic digestion yielded two disulfide-bridged peptide fragments on RP-HPLC, which were unambiguously identified by ESI-MS as [C2R][YADGTC4IY] and [C1Y][IPAC3IAGER][C5C6]. Edman degradation of the latter fragment further yielded [PTHC1][C6] and [PAC3IAGER][PTHC5], thus confirming the native connectivity of disulfide bonds in the synthetic d-Ala17-HNP2, i.e. Cys1-6, Cys2-4, and Cys3-5. It is worth noting that, in contrast to what was found with wild-type HNPs (28Wu Z. Prahl A. Powell R. Ericksen B. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Pept. Res. 2003; 62: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the Tyr16-d-Ala17 peptide bond was not cleaved by chymotrypsin. This finding is consistent with the fact that the scissile peptide bond flanked by d-amino acids is proteolytically resistant due to steric incompatibility in the enzyme-substrate complex.Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—The crystallization experiments were carried out at room temperature using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Droplets were prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein (15 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5) and reservoir solution. Three different crystal forms of d-Ala17-HNP2 were obtained, which belong to the monoclinic, tetragonal, and trigonal systems, respectively. Monoclinic crystals were grown from the solution containing 0.5 m lithium sulfate and 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. Tetragonal crystals were obtained from the solution consisting of 0.2 m trisodium citrate dihydrate, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, and 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. Trigonal crystals grew from the solution containing 0.5 m lithium sulfate and 2% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000.The x-ray diffraction data were collected using the synchrotron radiation source (line 22BM at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team station in the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, Chicago, IL), with the wavelength tuned to either 1.0 or 0.92 Å. The intensities were recorded using a MarCCD detector (x-ray Research, Germany). For data reduction and scaling, we used the program HKL2000 (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar), and the identity of the space group was unambiguously deduced from the systematic extinctions observed for the scaled intensities.

After removal of residual solvent, the lipid film was hydrated in the fluorescent solution containing 5 mm HEPES, 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, and 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, freeze-thawed for 10 cycles, and extruded 10 times through 0.4-μm polycarbonate membranes. LUVs were separated from unencapsulated materials by gel filtration chromatography using a Sepharose CL-4B column eluted with 5 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4Leakage of ANTS from LUVs, monitored on an LS-55 PerkinElmer luminescence spectrometer, was characterized by an increase in fluorescence, which was quenched by DPX when encapsulated together inside liposomes (31Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). 270 μl of ANTS/DPX-encapsulated LUVs were added to each well of a 96-well plate to a final lipid concentration of 600 μm. 30 μl of H2O was added to the first well of each row as a blank and 30 μl of 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 to the last (twelfth) well as the control for 100% leakage. Upon the addition of 30 μl of a 2-fold dilution series of defensin and incubation for 1 h, the fluorescence signal was recorded at 515 nm with an excitation wavelength of 353 nm, 10-nm bandwidths, and a 390-nm cutoff filter in the emission path. Percent leakage is expressed as, %leakage=Ft-F0F100-F0×100(Eq. 1) where Ft is the fluorescence determined at different time points after the addition of defensin, F0 is the background fluorescence of the “blank” cells, and F100 is the fluorescence of the control cells containing 0.25% Triton X-100.RESULTSd-Xaa17-HNP2 but Not l-Ala17-HNP2 Folds Productively—Substituting any of the seven d-amino acids in place of Gly17 and applying the previously published oxidative folding protocol for HNPs resulted in productive folding of the defensin with a yield of >65%. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, folded d-Ala17-HNP2 emerged predominately as a narrow peak on RP-HPLC after 8 h, shifting ∼4 min earlier in retention time compared with the peptide before oxidative folding. By contrast, l-Ala17-HNP2 under the same folding conditions massively precipitated (>60%). An analysis of the supernatant on RP-HPLC gave rise to a broad trace of much lower UV light absorbance with no distinct peak (<0.5%) at the expected retention time for the folded species over a period of 24 h (Fig. 3B). These findings suggest that, although d-amino acids at the Gly17 position are fully compatible structurally, substituting l-amino acids at that position causes defensins to misfold.FIGURE 3Top, oxidative folding of d-Ala17-HNP2 at 5 min and 8 h monitored by analytical HPLC (5-65% solvent B at 1 ml/min over 30 min on a Waters Symmetry 300 C18 column, 5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm, 40 °C). 40 μl (10 μg of peptide total) was injected. Middle, oxidative folding of l-Ala17-HNP2 at 8 h. Note that because most of the peptide precipitated during folding (>60%), a 40-μl injection gave rise to significantly lower signals.

Oxidative folding of d-Xaa17-HNP2 resulted in a loss of six mass units, consistent with the formation of three disulfide bridges in the protein. Peptide mass mapping coupled with complete tryptic/chymotryptic digestion and Edman degradation unequivocally established the correct disulfide connectivity in d-Ala17-HNP2, of which crystal structures were subsequently solved at high resolution.Structural Characterization of d-Ala17-HNP2—The crystals of all three forms of d-Ala17-HNP2 showed excellent diffraction properties. Consequently, the electron density was well defined for all the protein residues, including the d-Ala17 site (Fig. 4A). Although the asymmetric units of monoclinic and trigonal crystals contain four protein molecules arranged in two dimers, in the tetragonal crystals, only two monomers are structurally independent. The tertiary structures of d-Ala17-HNP2 are quite conserved for all 10 independent monomers of this protein, although some systematic differences could be observed. The root mean square deviations calculated for 29 C-α atoms varied between 0.2 and 0.8 Å, depending on the choice of aligned monomers. Despite the different crystal environment of each of 10 independent monomers, the conformations of most side chains appeared quite similar, as shown in Fig. 4B.FIGURE 4A, the final 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps around the d-Ala17 site in the monoclinic form of d-Ala17-HNP2. Maps shown here for the dimer were contoured at 1.3σ (2Fo - Fc, shown in blue), +2.8σ (Fo - Fc, green), and -2.8σ (Fo - Fc, red). Several residues are labeled for clarity. Individual red balls represent the oxygen atoms of ordered solvent molecules. The figure was prepared using Bobscript (64Esnouf R.M. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

B, the stereo representation of ten structurally independent (representing the asymmetric unit contents of three crystal forms) monomers of d-Ala17-HNP2 with equivalent C-α atoms superimposed. Selected residues have been labeled for ease of interpretation. High structural conservation, clearly evident for the backbones of protein chains, extends also over most of the side chains of d-Ala17-HNP2. The figure was prepared with programs Ribbons (65Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 958-961Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar) and POV-ray. C, flexibility of the d-Ala17-HNP2 dimers. The green and yellow C-α traces represent dimers present in the monoclinic crystals. The trace shown in red describes the tetragonal structure, whereas violet and blue reflect two dimeric assemblies from the trigonal crystals. Five dimers of d-Ala17-HNP2 were superimposed based on the C-α atoms of one monomer (shown on the left) only; therefore, discrepancies in the relative positions of the intimate monomers represent an extent of the flexibility of the dimer. A good estimate of the latter is gained by comparison to the 5 Å bar. It is clear that the most significant “deformation” is observed for the dimer of the monoclinic crystal form, i.e. assembly interacting in crystal lattice with the polyethylene glycol molecule. N, N terminus; C, C terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A significantly different outcome arises from comparison of five quaternary structures of d-Ala17-HNP2. These differences are particularly visible after aligning dimers based on the equivalent 29 C-α atoms from one monomer only (Fig. 4C). It is clear that the variability shown in the quaternary structures is a result of the different relative locations of monomers participating in dimerization. A better understanding can be obtained from the analysis of dimer-stabilizing interactions. The primary contribution to dimer formation and stabilization comes from four (N-H···O) main-chain hydrogen bonds between Thr18 and Ile20 from the equivalent β-strands of both monomers. Further stabilization of the dimer is provided by hydrophobic contacts between the phenyl rings of Phe28 from one monomer and the sulfur atoms forming the disulfide bridge between Cys4 and Cys19 of the second monomer. Finally, in some dimers, we observed short hydrogen bonds between the main-chain atoms of the two equivalent Cys2 residues mediated by water molecules or Cl- ions.d-Ala17-HNP2 Is Indistinguishable from HNP2 in Its Antibacterial Activity—Reinforcing our interpretation of structural data, antibacterial functional results"
https://openalex.org/W2008233932,"Isoprostanes (IsoPs) are isomers of prostaglandins that are generated from the free radical-initiated peroxidation of arachidonic acid (C20.4 ω-6). IsoPs exert potent bioactivity and are regarded as the “gold standard” to assess oxidative stress in various human diseases. Analogously, autoxidation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22.6 ω-3) generates an array of IsoP-like compounds that are termed neuroprostanes (NPs). A major class of NPs identified in vitro and in vivo contains F-type prostane rings and are know as F4-NPs. A number of different F4-NP regioisomers are formed from the peroxidation of DHA. Among the eight possible regioisomeric groups, we hypothesize that 4- and 20-series NPs are generated in greater amounts than other classes because the precursors that lead to regioisomers other than those of the 4- and 20-series can be further oxidized to form novel dioxolane-IsoP-like compounds, analogous to those generated from arachidonate. Various mass spectrometric approaches, including electron capture atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry, were utilized to analyze NPs formed in vitro and in vivo based on their characteristic fragmentation in the gas phase. Experimental results were consistent with our hypothesis that 4- and 20-series NP regioisomers are preferentially generated. The discovery of regioselectivity in the formation of NPs will allow studies of the biological activities of NPs to focus on the more abundantly generated compounds to determine their role in modulating the pathophysiological consequences of DHA oxidation and oxidant stress.

Isoprostanes (IsoPs) are prostaglandin (PG)-like compounds that are formed non-enzymatically in vivo from the peroxidation of arachidonic acid (C20.4 ω-6) by free radicals. A number of IsoPs have been identified that contain different functional groups on the prostane ring analogous to different classes of PGs. These include F2-IsoPs, D2/E2-IsoPs, A2/J2-IsoPs, and isothromboxanes (4Roberts Jr., L.J. Morrow J.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 5Morrow J.D.

A novel aspect of IsoP formation is that, unlike cyclooxygenase-derived PGs, IsoPs are generated in situ, esterified in phospholipids and other lipids, and subsequently cleaved from these lipid storage sites by various enzymes. In addition, IsoPs have different stereochemistry from PGs in that the former contain side chains that are predominantly in the cis configuration in relation to the prostane ring (6Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Roberts II, L.J. Prostaglandins. 1992; 42: 155-163Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition to novel aspects of their formation, quantification of IsoPs has emerged as one of the most accurate approaches to assess oxidant injury in vivo (4Roberts Jr., L.J. Morrow J.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 7Rokach J. Khanapure S.P. Hwang S.W. Adiyama M. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A.

Prostaglandins. 1992; 42: 155-163Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Docosahexaenoic acid (C22.6 ω-3, DHA) is a fatty acid that is highly enriched in brain, particularly in gray matter, where it comprises ∼25-35% of the total fatty acids in aminophospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine (8Skinner E.

Oxidation of DHA in the central nervous system has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, including, importantly, Alzheimer disease. DHA is highly susceptible to autoxidation because it has six double bonds. We have previously shown that analogous to arachidonic acid, IsoP-like compounds can be generated from the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of DHA both in vitro and in vivo. These compounds are termed neuroprostanes (NPs) (11Roberts Jr., L.J. Montine T.J. Markesbery W.R. Tapper A.R. Hardy P. Chemtob S. Dettbarn W.D. Morrow J.D. J. Biol.

We have found that that F4-NPs are markedly increased in the brain tissue of humans with Alzheimer disease supporting the contention that oxidation of DHA is increased in this disorder (12Musiek E.S.

Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem.

These were undertaken to provide a rationale for biological studies focusing on the most abundantly generated isomers. The free radical-initiated peroxidation of arachidonic acid and its esters generates complex mixtures of primary hydroperoxides and cyclic peroxides with dozens of regioisomers and diastereomers (15Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Four IsoP regioisomer classes are formed from the oxidation of arachidonate depending on the site of initial hydrogen atom abstraction and subsequent oxygen insertion (Scheme 1). 5-Series and 15-series IsoPs are produced from hydrogen atom abstraction at C-7 and C-13, respectively, whereas hydrogen atom abstraction at C-10 gives rise to 8-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (8-HPETE) and 12-HPETE that subsequently generate 12-series and 8-series IsoPs, respectively. Among these four regioisomers, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that 5- and 15-series IsoPs are formed in significantly greater amounts than 8- and 12-series IsoPs (19Waugh R.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Waugh R.J. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 7: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Li H. Lawson J.A. Reilly M. Adiyaman M. Hwang S.-W. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13381-13386Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The difference in the formation of various IsoP regioisomers is a consequence of the fact that a novel series of oxidation products, termed dioxolane-IsoPs, are also generated from 8-HPETE and 12-HPETE via the additional oxidation of IsoP endoperoxides derived from these two peroxides (22Yin H. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3766-3776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Although the oxidation of DHA is significantly more complicated than arachidonic acid, the same free radical mechanism can be applied to its peroxidation to predict the products that are generated and, in particular, to predict the relative abundance of NP regioisomers. Ten hydroperoxides of DHA (hydroperoxyl docosahexaenoic acid (HpDHA)) can be formed from the oxidation of this PUFA (23VanRollins M. Murphy R. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 507-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further oxidation of these regioisomeric peroxyl radicals will generate eight groups of NP regioisomers (Scheme 2). Based on our previous studies of arachidonate peroxidation, we hypothesize that 4- and 20-series NPs will be produced in greater amounts than the other regioisomers because the precursor radicals that lead to these two 4- and 20-series NPs cannot further cyclize to form dioxolane-IsoP-like compounds. Herein, we provide experimental evidence to show that, indeed, 4- and 20-series NPs are two of the most abundant NP regioisomers generated from the autoxidation of DHA both in vitro and in vivo. Several approaches were used. First, we purified the various HpDHA isomers generated from the autoxidation of this PUFA as described using semipreparative HPLC (24Seal J.R. Porter N.A. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2004; 378: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We then oxidized different HpDHA species and analyzed the NP products using liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-MS). The MS fragmentation pattern for various NPs was extrapolated from our data for IsoPs and verified by collision-induced dissociation (CID). Secondly, oxidation mixtures of DHA F4-NPs were studied by LC-APCI-MS and by gas chromatography (GC)-electron ionization MS. The results obtained are consistent with our hypothesis that 4- and 20-series NPs are generated in greater amounts than other NP isomers. In addition, we report virtually identical results in vivo when rodent brain and liver tissue are analyzed for various NP isomers. These findings have significant implications regarding the relative formation of different NPs and suggest that initial studies related to NP bioactivity should focus on 4- and 20-series compounds.Scheme 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All lipid autoxidation reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of oxygen unless otherwise noted.

All other reagents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification.Lipid Identification and Separation Methods—Reactions involving hydroperoxides were visualized by TLC using a stain of 1.5 g N,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride/25 ml H2O/125 ml MeOH/1 ml acetic acid. Hydroperoxides yield an immediate pink color, whereas cyclic peroxides exhibit a pink color after mild charring. General TLC staining was accomplished by iodine or use of a phosphomolybdic acid stain prepared as a 20% (w/v) solution in ethanol. In general, hydroperoxides were stored as dilute solutions with 1 mol % butylated hydroxytoluene in either hexanes or benzene at -78 °C and were never exposed to temperatures > 40 °C. Flash column chromatography was performed using 35-70 μm silica gel. Thin layer chromatography was performed using 0.2-mm layer thickness silica gel-coated aluminum (60 F254, EM Industries), and TLC plates were analyzed using UV light (254 nm) with a Mineralight UVSL-25 hand lamp. Preparative TLC was carried out on silica gel 60ALK6D plates (Whatman).Analytical HPLC was performed using a Waters Model 600E pump with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Millenium32 chromatography software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) was utilized to control the array detector and to collect and process data. Pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) esters of IsoPs and NPs were analyzed by normal phase HPLC using 12% isopropanol in hexanes and a single analytical Beckman Ultrasphere 5-μm (4.6 mm × 25 cm) silica column or two narrow bore Beckman Ultrasphere 5-μm (2.0 mm × 25 cm) silica columns. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was used for analytical normal phase HPLC, whereas 0.2 ml/min was employed for narrow bore columns. Semipreparative HPLC was carried out using a Dynamax-60 Å 8-μm (83-121-C) silica column (21.4 mm × 25 cm) with a flow rate of 10 ml/min. For reverse phase HPLC analysis of PFB esters, a Phenomenex (Torrance, CA) Ultracarb ODS 5-μm 4.6 mm × 25 cm column was used at 1 ml/min flow rate with a gradient starting with 50% solvent A (95:5, water:MeOH) and 50% solvent B (5:95, water:MeOH), holding for 2 min and increasing to 100% B in 20 min and holding for 10 min.Mass Spectrometry—On-line reverse phase liquid chromatography was carried out using the ThermoFinnigan Surveyor MS Pump 2.0 equipped with the columns mentioned above. Samples were analyzed using a ThermoFinnigan TSQ Quantum 1.0 SR 1 mass spectrometer. The APCI source was fitted with a deactivated fused silica capillary (100 μm, inner diameter). The mass spectrometer was operated in negative ion mode with a capillary temperature of 300 °C, vaporizer temperature of 460 °C, discharge current 20 and -94 V tube lens voltage. Nitrogen was used as both the sheath gas and the auxiliary gas, at 21 and 3 p.s.i., respectively. For tandem MS experiments, collision energies were optimized between 20 and 30 eV under 1.5 millitorr of argon. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Xcaliber software, version 1.3. Samples were introduced either by direct liquid infusion or HPLC. For normal phase HPLC, samples were introduced by a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC system.Gas chromatography MS was performed in chemical or electron ionization mode using a Hewlett-Packard HP5989A GC-MS instrument interfaced with an IBM Pentium computer system. GC was carried out using a 30-m, 0.25-mm diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness DB 1701 fused silica capillary column (Fison, Folsom, CA). The column temperature was programmed from 190 to 260 °C at 10 °C/min. Methane was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Ion source temperature was 250 °C, electron energy was 70 eV, and filament current was 0.25 mA.Oxidation of DHA Methyl Ester to Primary Hydroperoxides—DHA methyl ester (500 mg, 1.46 mmol) was dissolved in 1.5 ml of acetonitrile to make a solution of 0.97 m. To the mixture were added 44 mg of N-methyl benzohydroxamic acid (2.92 mmol) and 0.05 equivalent of di-tert-butyl hyponitrite as a radical initiator (27Punta C. Rector C.L. Porter N.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2005; 18: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The reaction was stirred under oxygen at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction was quenched by adding 2 mg of butylated hydroxytoluene, and N-methyl benzohydroxamic acid was removed by flash chromatography on silica gel. The hydroperoxides were analyzed and separated by analytical and semipreparative HPLC, and reasonable separation was obtained as described previously (24Seal J.R. Porter N.A. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2004; 378: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The separated fractions of primary hydroperoxides were converted to more highly oxidized peroxides according to our previous procedure (18Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a mixture of all NP isomers derived from DHA was obtained by incubating DHA with di-tert-butyl hyponitrite. A similar method was employed to generate mixture of IsoPs from arachidonate as described previously (15Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Derivatization of Neuroprostanes for LC-EC-APCI and GC-MS Analyses—Oxidized lipids derived from ∼100 μg of lipid hydroperoxides were reduced by adding an excess amount of PPh3 or by catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon (28Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Gao L. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16720-16725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The reduced lipid was subjected to basic hydrolysis using 1.0 m KOH for 60 min at 40 °C. After adjusting to pH 3, the mixture was loaded onto a C18 Sep-Pak (Waters Corp.) cartridge that was preconditioned with 5 ml of methanol and then 5 ml of water. The column was washed with 5 ml of water and 5 ml of heptane. The eluent of 10 ml of ethyl acetate was collected. The solution was dried over Na2SO4. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was dissolved in 20 μl of CH3CN. To the resulting solution was added 20 μl of 10% (v/v) PFB bromide in acetonitrile and 10 μl of 10% (v/v) N,N-diisopropylethylamine in acetonitrile, and the mixture was kept at room temperature for 30 min. The reagent was dried under nitrogen, and the residue was subjected to TLC separation using a protocol reported recently (12Musiek E.S. Cha J.K. Yin H. Zackert W.E. Terry E.S. Porter N.A. Montine T.J. Morrow J.D. J. Chromatogr. A. 2004; 799: 95-102Google Scholar). The PFB esters, after TLC separation, were either directly analyzed by LC-APCI-MS or were further derivatized to trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives for GC-MS analysis. For the latter, after evaporation of the ethyl acetate, 20 μl of N,O-Bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and 10 μl of dimethylformamide were added to the residue, and the mixture was incubated at 40 °C for 20 min. The reagents were dried under nitrogen, and the derivatives were dissolved in 10 μl of dry undecane for analysis by GC-MS.Purification and Analysis of F4-NPs from Rat Brain—The purification and derivatization scheme for the analysis of F4-NPs was reported recently and utilized herein (12Musiek E.S. Cha J.K. Yin H. Zackert W.E. Terry E.S. Porter N.A. Montine T.J. Morrow J.D. J. Chromatogr. A. 2004; 799: 95-102Google Scholar). Briefly samples of brain tissue (75-300 mg) were homogenized in 5 ml of ice-cold chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) containing butylated hydroxytoluene (0.005%). Esterified F4-NPs in phospholipids were isolated and hydrolyzed using chemical saponification by adding 2 ml of 15% aqueous potassium hydroxide. The samples were acidified to pH 3 with 1 m HCl and diluted to 25 ml with pH 3 H2O. 1 ng of a chemically synthesized 18O 17-F4c-NP standard was then added to the samples and purified by Sep-Pak extraction. Purified NPs were converted to PFB esters TMS ether derivatives and analyzed by GC-MS.Animal Model of Oxidant Stress and Purification of NPs From Rat Livers—The extraction of lipids from livers of rats has been reported previously (29Gao L. Zackert W.E. Hasford J.J. Danekis M.E. Milne G.L. Remmert C. Reese J. Yin H. Tai H.H. Dey S.K. Porter N.A. Morrow J.D. J. Biol.

In brief, after intragastric administration of CCl4 (2 mg/kg) in corn oil to Sprague-Dawley rats for 2 h, the animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) intraperitoneally and sacrificed. Livers were subsequently removed and 1-4 g of tissue immediately extracted to obtain a crude phospholipid mixture. After basic hydrolysis, PFB esterification and TMS derivatization were performed and NPs analyzed as described above.RESULTSApplication of LC-APCI-MS to Study the Regioselectivity of Isoprostanes Formed from the Autoxidation of Arachidonic Acid—As noted, several reports have examined issues related to the stereochemistry of IsoP formation in vitro and in vivo (17O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3577-3584Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Waugh R.J. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 7: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among the four IsoP regioisomers that are generated, 5- and 15-series molecules are formed in significantly greater amounts than 8- and 12-series IsoPs (Scheme 1). This selectivity in regioisomer formation is because of the generation of dioxolane-IsoPs from the precursors that lead to 8- and 12-series IsoPs, whereas the precursors of 5- and 15-series IsoPs cannot undergo further oxidation to form dioxolane-IsoPs. Additionally, for each IsoP regioisomer, it is hypothesized that eight diastereoisomers are generated. We have previously identified these eight diastereomers of the 15-series IsoPs utilizing GC-MS (15Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).EC-APCI-MS has been utilized to structurally characterize various synthetic and biological molecules after electrophilic derivatization (30Singh G. Gutierrez A. Xu K. Blair I.A. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 31Lee S.H. Williams M.V. DuBois R.N. Blair I.A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 2168-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This technique is revolutionary because it combines the exquisite sensitivity and selectivity of EC with HPLC separation methods. We have utilized EC-APCI-MS to examine the formation of different arachidonate-derived IsoPs as a prelude to studying DHA-derived NP regioisomer generation. For these studies, a mixture of in vitro arachidonate oxidation products was initially reduced with triphenylphosphine and F2-IsoP regioisomers were analyzed as PFB esters employing selective reaction monitoring (SRM). The results are illustrated in Fig. 1. Corroborating our previous report using GC-MS, 5- (Fig. 1a) and 15-series (Fig. 1d) IsoPs are formed in significantly greater abundance than 8- (Fig. 1c) and 12-series (Fig. 1b) compounds (20Waugh R.J. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 7: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Yin H. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Biol.

Because deuterated internal standards for 15- (Fig. 1e), 5- (Fig. 1f), and 8 (Fig. 1g)-series IsoPs have nearly identical responses in our SRM analysis, the relative intensity of individual regioisomers reflects the actual abundance.Fig. 1SRM results of regioisomers obtained from the in vitro oxidation of arachidonic acid by EC-APCI-MS.

The four IsoP regioisomers can be divided into two groups when analyzed by MS depending on the position of the hydroxyl group on the side chain. 5- and 8-series IsoPs possess side chain hydroxyl groups before the cyclopentyl ring structure, whereas 12- and 15-series IsoPs contain hydroxyl groups after the ring. Fragmentation patterns of the IsoPs in the gas phase of MS largely depend on the location of the hydroxyl group (19Waugh R.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Waugh R.J. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 7: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Murphy R.C. Fiedler J. Hevko J. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 479-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, IsoPs with the hydroxyl before the ring (5- and 8-series) show predominantly α cleavage next to the hydroxyl groups (m/z 115 and m/z 127). On the other hand, 12- and 15-series IsoPs undergo multiple bond cleavages to generate the characteristic fragments (m/z 151 and m/z 193). These results support the contention that EC-APCI-MS can be used to study oxidation products derived not only from arachidonate but also from other PUFAs such as DHA.Regioselectivity of Neuroprostanes Formed from the Autoxidation of DHA Analyzed by EC-APCI-MS—As noted, eight regioisomeric groups of NPs would be predicted to be formed from the autoxidation of DHA (Scheme 2). Understanding the stereochemistry of NP formation will provide the rationale to study the biological activity of the compounds that are formed in the greatest abundance. Oxidation of DHA would be predicted to lead to the generation of NPs and other highly oxidized products, as shown in Scheme 3A, in which the peroxidation of 10-HpDHA is used as an example.

Dynorphin opioid peptides are similar to cell-penetrating peptides in a high content of basic and hydrophobic amino acid residues. We demonstrate that dynorphin A and big dynorphin, consisting of dynorphins A and B, can penetrate into neurons and non-neuronal cells using confocal fluorescence microscopy/immunolabeling. The peptide distribution was characterized by cytoplasmic labeling with minimal signal in the cell nucleus and on the plasma membrane. Translocated peptides were associated with the endoplasmic reticulum but not with the Golgi apparatus or clathrin-coated endocytotic vesicles. Rapid entry of dynorphin A into the cytoplasm of live cells was revealed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The translocation potential of dynorphin A was comparable with that of transportan-10, a prototypical cell-penetrating peptide. A central big dynorphin fragment, which retains all basic amino acids, and dynorphin B did not enter the cells. The latter two peptides interacted with negatively charged phospholipid vesicles similarly to big dynorphin and dynorphin A, suggesting that interactions of these peptides with phospholipids in the plasma membrane are not impaired. Translocation was not mediated via opioid receptors. The potential of dynorphins to penetrate into cells correlates with their ability to induce non-opioid effects in animals. Translocation across the plasma membrane may represent a previously unknown mechanism by which dynorphins can signal information to the cell interior.

Translocation across the plasma membrane may represent a previously unknown mechanism by which dynorphins can signal information to the cell interior. In cell signaling, information is conveyed across the plasma membrane to the cell interior. Specific receptors at the outer surface of the plasma membrane that recognize extracellular chemical stimuli transfer a signal across the plasma membrane to specific effector molecules at the inner surface of the membrane or within the cytoplasm and trigger the cellular response. However, not all information is transmitted through cell-surface receptors. Nitric oxide, for example, passes through the plasma membrane and induces cellular responses by interacting with intracellular proteins.

In functional studies translocation of Antennapedia into neuronal cells induces augmented morphological differentiation (2Joliot A. Pernelle C. Deagostini-Bazin H. Prochiantz A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar). Translocation of Tat into T-cells leads to degradation of IκBα, induction of apoptosis, and secretion of interleukin (7Vendeville A. Rayne F. Bonhoure A. Bettache N. Montcourrier P. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2347-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of peptide penetration are not clear. Uptake mediated through macropinocytosis or clathrin-mediated or caveolar endocytosis has been proposed (7Vendeville A. Rayne F. Bonhoure A. Bettache N. Montcourrier P. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol.

Other models, suggesting translocation of the CPPs across the lipid bilayer through stable or transiently formed pores or inverted micelles, have also been hypothesized (11Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The basic nature due to the high content of arginine or lysine, the amphipathic character, and/or the presence of a hydrophobic core sequences have been suggested as important structural features of CPPs (12Wender P.A.

Little is known about the cellular functions of CPPs; they have generally been studied as vectors for intracellular delivery of cargo molecules with pharmacologic potential (11Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 15Järver P. Langel Ü. Drug Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A role for Tat and homeodomain proteins has been suggested in intercellular communication and cell signaling (16Prochiantz A. Joliot A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Neuropeptides are a group of short, 3-35 amino acid peptides that act as neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous system. They are released from axon terminals or dendrites of neurons, diffuse to pre- or postsynaptic neuronal structures, and bind to and activate membrane G protein-coupled receptors. Signals induced upon peptide interaction with receptors trigger a cascade of secondary messengers. Several actions of neuropeptides such as substance P and dynorphin A (Dyn A) are not mediated through their cognate receptors (17Faden A.I. Jacobs T.P. Br. J.

The proinflammatory actions of substance P, including stimulation of release of vasoactive and inflammatory compounds from peritoneal mast cells, involve a receptor-independent mechanism (21Saban R.

This mechanism is apparently based on direct interaction of substance P with the α subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, following the peptide translocation across the plasma membrane (22Lorenz D. Wiesner B. Zipper J. Winkler A. Krause E. Beyermann M. Lindau M. Bienert M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 577-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Dyn A and dynorphin B (Dyn B), prodynorphin-derived opioid peptides, are endogenous ligands for κ-opioid receptors that mediate many activities of dynorphins (23Chavkin C. James I.F. Goldstein A.

Because hydrophobicity and/or basic nature are general properties of CPPs (Table I), we hypothesized that the basic dynorphins may also translocate across the plasma membrane, which may be relevant for interneuronal communication in the central nervous system. To test this hypothesis, we studied the ability of dynorphins to penetrate into cells using immunocytochemistry, confocal fluorescence microscopy, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on live and/or fixed cells. We also investigated the kinetics of translocation of the dynorphin peptides, their intracellular distribution, and interactions with phospholipid membranes relevant for the translocation into cells.Table IAmino acid sequences and properties of dynorphins as compared with cell-penetrating peptidesPeptideSequenceCharge at pH 7.0aValues estimated for ideal solutions.pIaValues estimated for ideal solutions.Basic amino acidsbContribution of basic amino acids (Arg, Lys, and His).Hydrophobic residuescContribution of hydrophobic amino acids (Val, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr, Pro, and Ala).%%Dyn AYGGFLRRIRPKLKWDNQ+411.429.441.2Dyn BYGGFLRRQFKVVT+311.423.130.8Big DynYGGFLRRIRPKLKWDNQKRYGGFLRRQFKVVT+912.231.234.4Big Dyn 6-26RRIRPKLKWDNQKRYGGFLRR+812.534.626.9TatRKKRRQRRR+813.288.90.0PenetratinRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK+712.843.831.2R7RRRRRRR+713.3100.00.0Transportan, TP10AGYLLGKINLKALAALAKKIL-amide+410.619.066.7a Values estimated for ideal solutions.b Contribution of basic amino acids (Arg, Lys, and His).c Contribution of hydrophobic amino acids (Val, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr, Pro, and Ala). Open table in a new tab Peptides—Big Dyn, Dyn A, Dyn B, Big Dyn 6-26 (Table I), and biotinylated forms of these peptides with biotin attached to the N-terminal tyrosine via 6-aminohexanoic acid were synthesized at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University. Peptides were purified by reversed-phase chromatography on Vydac C18 218 TP 1022 and Sephasil C8 columns in a 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile/water solvent system and finally by gel filtration on a Superdex column in 1 m acetic acid. They were analyzed by analytical reversed-phase chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Purity was determined by integration of the UV peak at λ = 215 nm. The purity of all peptides was >98%. Fluorescently labeled Dyn A (5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-dynorphin A, Rh-Dyn A, C124H175N33O27, Mr = 3242) and Dyn B (5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-dynorphin B, Rh-Dyn B, C99H135N23O21, Mr = 2552) were synthesized in the form of 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine attached to the N terminus and purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (10 μm, 300 Å, 21 × 250 mm). Two solvent systems, acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and methanol/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, were used to assess the purity. The final purity of the peptide, determined in both analytical systems by integration of the UV peak at λ = 214 nm, was >98%. The molecular weight of the fluorescent peptide was determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI MS). Transportan-10 (TP10, C104H185N27O23, Mr = 2182) was synthesized in a stepwise manner in a 0.1-mmol scale on a peptide synthesizer (model 431A; Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using a t-butoxycarbonyl strategy of solid phase peptide synthesis. t-Butoxycarbonyl amino acids were coupled as hydroxybenzotriazole esters to a p-methylbenzylhydrylamine resin (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) to obtain C-terminally amidated peptides. The rhodamine moiety was coupled manually to the N-terminal amino group. The fluorescently labeled peptide (5-(and-6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-TP10, Rh-TP10, C129H205N29O27, Mr = 2594) was finally cleaved from the resin with liquid HF at 0 °C for 60 min in the presence of p-cresol and p-thiocresol. The purity of the peptide was >98%, as demonstrated by HPLC on an analytical Discovery C-18 reversed-phase HPLC column (15 × 0.46 cm, 5 μm, Supelco), and the correct molecular mass was obtained by using MALDI-TOF MS (Voyager-DE STR; Applied Biosystems). Dyn B and Big Dyn were labeled with 125I using the direct chloramine-T method. The labeled peptides were separated from free iodine by HPLC on a Vydac C18 column using a linear gradient 15-40% of acetronitrile/water with 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid (31Christensson-Nylander I.

Proteins and Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antisera were generated against rat Dyn A and Dyn B, which had been conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via their N-terminal cysteine residues. IgG fractions were purified with protein A-Sepharose. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragments, transferrin from human serum-conjugated with Alexa Fluor 546, streptavidin-conjugated with Alexa Fluor 633, and anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 546 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands. Monoclonal antibodies against the marker of the Golgi complex GM 130 from the Organelle sampler kit were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. The monoclonal antibody against ERp29, the marker of the endoplasmic reticulum, was a kind gift from Dr. S. Mkrtchian, Karolinska Institutet (32Mkrtchian S. Fang C. Hellman U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human cervical carcinoma HeLa, monkey kidney COS-1, and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were plated on 6-well plates (1.2 × 105 cells per well) or 12-well plates with glass coverslips (1 × 104 cells per well) and cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. To cultivate PC12 cells, coverslips were precoated with 10 μg/ml of poly-l-lysine (Sigma). HeLa and COS-1 cells were cultivated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. HeLa cells used in the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies were cultivated in eight-well chambers (Nalge, Nunc, IL), 1-8 × 104 cells per well, in phenol red-free Iscove's medium (Invitrogen) in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. PC12 cells were cultivated in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum. Primary cultures of cerebellar cells were prepared from cerebellum of 8-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (B & K Universal, Sollentuna, Sweden) as described previously (33Cebers G. Liljequist S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 290: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation in a 0.25% trypsin solution, cells were dispersed by trituration in a DNase- and soybean trypsin inhibitor-containing solution (0.01 and 0.05%, respectively) and plated (5 × 105 cells/ml/well) onto 24-well plates containing round glass coverslips (13 mm) coated with 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine. Cells were cultivated in Basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin and cultured for 8 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Cytosine β-arabinofuranoside (10 μm) was added 24 h after plating to limit the number of non-neuronal cells. Peptide Translocation Studies—In the assay with biotinylated peptides, HeLa cells were incubated with 1.0 μm of the biotinylated peptides for 1 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C, again washed three times with PBS, incubated in 100 mm glycine for 5 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and after washing were incubated in blocking buffer for 10 min. For peptide visualization, cells were incubated with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 633 conjugate for 1 h. In the antibody labeling assay, HeLa, PC12, or COS-1 cells were incubated with 1.0 μm Big Dyn, 10 μm Dyn A, or 10 μm DynB for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum or in its absence. The medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with PBS prior to fixation in 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Cerebellar granule cells were incubated with peptide for 2 h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. In some experiments the fixation was performed in 2% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated in 100 mm glycine for 5 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated in a blocking buffer (0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 10 min and then overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-dynorphin B-antiserum, IgG fraction, or rabbit anti-dynorphin A-antiserum, IgG fraction. After washing, the cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragments conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, washed, and mounted in Dako fluorescence media. For confocal microscopy, live HeLa cells were incubated with 10 μm fluorescently labeled Rh-Dyn A or Rh-Dyn B for 15 min. After three additional washings with the medium, cells were viewed under a confocal microscope. Colocalization Studies—For colocalization studies with transferrin, HeLa cells were incubated with 1.0 μm Big Dyn and 25 μg/ml transferrin conjugated with Alexa 546 for 1 h, fixed, and labeled with rabbit anti-dynorphin B antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragments conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488. For colocalization with the markers of the endoplasmic reticulum ERp29 and the Golgi complex GM 130, HeLa cells were incubated with 1.0 μm Big Dyn for 1 h, fixed, and stained with rabbit anti-dynorphin B antibody and monoclonal antibodies against ERp29 or GM 130 as primary antibodies and goat anti-rabbit IgG F (ab′)2 fragments conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 546 as secondary antibodies. Microscopy—Confocal images were recorded using a Leica TCS SP confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystem, Heidelberg, Germany). Images were prepared using Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe; San Jose, CA). FCS—In this method, statistical analysis of the time course and amplitudes of spontaneous fluctuations in fluorescence intensity in a small volume element was performed to evaluate dynamic processes (34Rigler R.

For focusing optics, a Zeiss Neofluar 40 × NA 1.2 objective for water immersion was used in an epi-illumination set up. Dichroic (Omega 540 DRL PO2) and band pass (Omega 565 DR 50) filters were used to separate the excited from the emitted radiation. The rhodamine fluorophore was excited with the 514 nm wavelength of an argon laser. The fluorescence intensity was detected by an avalanche photo diode (SPCM-200, EG & G). Prior to FCS measurements, HeLa cells were washed and incubated with fluorescently labeled peptides Rh-Dyn A, Rh-Dyn B, Rh-TP10, or free rhodamine (Rh, in the form of tetramethylrhodamine-5-(6)-isothiocyanate, Molecular Probes) in phenol red-free Iscove's medium with 10% calf serum at room temperature. Fluorescence intensity was measured at different intervals after incubation in the medium and at different subcellular locations. The average fluorescence intensity was estimated from 10-s measurements. Binding of 125I-Big Dyn and 125I-Dyn B to HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were dissociated with trypsin and suspended in the RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were incubated with 125I-Big Dyn (60,000 cpm/1 ml) or 125I-Dyn B (65,000 cpm/1 ml) for 10, 30, or 60 min at 37 °C. In some of the experiments, the cells were preincubated with 100 μm poly-l-lysine or 100 μm unlabeled Big Dyn for 30 min. The cell-bound radioactivity was separated from the free label by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Washing did not reduce the cell-bound radioactivity. Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray (ES) ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI MS/MS) was performed on a Q-TOF (Micromass), mass spectrometer equipped with an orthogonal sampling ES-interface (Z-spray, Micromass). Samples were introduced via gold-coated nano-ES needles (Protana). A capillary voltage of 800-1000 V was applied together with a cone voltage of 40-45 V and collision energy of 4.2 eV. The sample aerosol was desolvated in a stream of nitrogen. During collision-induced dissociation, the collision energy was in the range of 15-30 eV, and argon was used as the collision gas. For MS measurements, HeLa cells were incubated with 20 μm Big Dyn in the presence of fetal calf serum for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, detached with Versene (EDTA) solution (Invitrogen), and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were extracted with 1 m acetic acid at 95 °C for 5 min. The suspension was ultrasonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was diluted with trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% final), loaded onto Sep-Pak columns (C18; Waters Inc., UK), equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and after washing the columns with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 1% trifluoroacetic acid in 30% acetonitrile, the peptides were eluted with 1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile. The dried peptide fraction was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto C18 Zip Tips (Millipore) activated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile, and finally equilibrated in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. After washing the Zip Tips with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, the peptides were eluted with 1% acetic acid in 60% acetonitrile. Vesicle Preparation—Small, unilamellar 70% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine, 30% palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphoglycerol (POPC/POPG) vesicles that are less than 100 nm in diameter and with a 30% negative surface charge density were prepared from the highest quality POPC and POPG (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. Weighed amounts of POPC and POPG at the desired concentrations (with the chosen POPC/POPG molar ratio) were dissolved in chloroform to ensure complete mixing of the components. The solvent was removed under high vacuum for 3 h, and the dried lipids were dispersed in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and cooled. The ice-cooled dispersion was sonicated under nitrogen using a Heat System model 350 A sonifier, with the microtip at a low output control (setting 4) and 50% duty cycle, until maximal transparency was reached (∼30 min). Titanium particles and lipid debris were removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 1 h. Determination of Dyn"
https://openalex.org/W2085778346,"The cytoskeletal component tubulin/microtubule commonly allows the cell to respond mechanically to the environment. The concentration of free tubulin dimer is autoregulated in the balance of free dimer and polymeric forms of microtubule (MT) protein, having an intrinsic property of ""dynamic instability"", and through cotranslational beta-tubulin mRNA degradation. Recently, we have demonstrated that alphaB-crystallin is a key molecule of muscle atrophy, since alphaB-crystallin has a chaperone-like-activity that suppresses tubulin aggregation and protects the MT disassembly against both Ca2+ and depolymelizing alkaloid in vitro. Most of the small heat-shock proteins (sHsps), including alphaB-crystallin, are expressed in skeletal muscle. However, no report to date has studied the changes of tubulin/MT during muscle adaptation. Here, we examined changes in tubulin content in rat soleus muscles after hindlimb suspension (HS) with/without passive stretch and the recovery. HS induced rapid decreases of soleus muscle mass, most Hsps (alphaB-crystallin, Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp27, and p20) and tubulin contents in soleus muscle, while heat-shock cognate 70-kDa protein (Hsc70) did not decrease. Soleus muscle mass, most Hsps, and tubulin were maintained with passive stretch. After 5 days' recovery, the levels of tubulin and Hsps, but not Hsc70, were restored to control levels. The interactions of alphaB-crystallin and tubulin/MT were observed with immunoprecipitation with an anti-alpha-tubulin antibody and taxol-dependent MT assembly. Other sHsps were also associated with alphaB-crystallin and MT, whereas Hsp90 and Hsp70 did not co-precipitate with them. These data imply an interaction and close relationship between alphaB-crystallin and tubulin/MTs in muscle tissues. The amount of mRNA of alphaB-crystallin decreased with the muscle atrophy level, whereas the gene expression level of betaI-tubulin was maintained during HS. This means a significant role of post-transcriptional regulation in tubulin/MT system in muscle adaptation, whereas alphaB-crystallin and most sHsps are regulated at the transcriptional level. Additional functional contribution of alphaB-crystallin to tubulin/MTs during myotube formation was examined using C2C12 myoblast cultured cells, the alphaB-crystallin expression of which was decreased or increased. It indicated the necessity of alphaB-crystallin during microtubule reorganization. In conclusion, tubulin/MTs were revealed to be one of the substrates of alphaB-crystallin, and also serial decreases of alphaB-crystallin and tubulin/MT in early soleus muscle atrophy suggest that the chaperone effect of alphaB-crystallin on the cytoskeleton, which may be also dynamically regulated in the muscle cell, is a key mechanism for muscle adaptation and protection of the atrophy and also muscle differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2085008335,"Anthrax toxin protective antigen (PrAg) forms a heptamer in which the binding site for lethal factor (LF) spans two adjacent monomers1,2. This suggested that high cell-type specificity in tumor targeting could be obtained using monomers that generate functional LF-binding sites only through intermolecular complementation. We created PrAg mutants with mutations affecting different LF-binding subsites and containing either urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) or matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) cleavage sites. Individually, these PrAg mutants had low toxicity as a result of impaired LF binding, but when administered together to uPA- and MMP-expressing tumor cells, they assembled into functional LF-binding heteroheptamers. The mixture of two complementing PrAg variants had greatly reduced toxicity in mice and was highly effective in the treatment of aggressive transplanted tumors of diverse origin. These results show that anthrax toxin, and by implication other multimeric toxins, offer excellent opportunities to introduce multiple-specificity determinants and thereby achieve high therapeutic indices."
https://openalex.org/W2093386024,"The electron transfer cascade from photosystem I to NADP+ was studied at physiological pH by flash-absorption spectroscopy in a Synechocystis PCC6803 reconstituted system comprised of purified photosystem I, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase. Experiments were conducted with a 34-kDa ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase homologous to the chloroplast enzyme and a 38-kDa N-terminal extended form. Small differences in kinetic and catalytic properties were found for these two forms, although the largest one has a 3-fold decreased affinity for ferredoxin. The dissociation rate of reduced ferredoxin from photosystem I (800 s(-1)) and the redox potential of the first reduction of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (-380 mV) were determined. In the absence of NADP+, differential absorption spectra support the existence of a high affinity complex between oxidized ferredoxin and semireduced ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase. An effective rate of 140-170 s(-1) was also measured for the second reduction of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, this process having a rate constant similar to that of the first reduction. In the presence of NADP+, the second-order rate constant for the first reduction of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase was 20% slower than in its absence, in line with the existence of ternary complexes (ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase)-NADP+-ferredoxin. A single catalytic turnover was monitored, with 50% NADP+ being reduced in 8-10 ms using 1.6 microM photosystem I. In conditions of multiple turnover, we determined initial rates of 360-410 electrons per s and per ferredox-in-NADP+ reductase for the reoxidation of 3.5 microM photoreduced ferredoxin. Identical rates were found with photosystem I lacking the PsaE subunit and wild type photosystem I. This suggests that, in contrast with previous proposals, the PsaE subunit is not involved in NADP+ photoreduction."
https://openalex.org/W1968204849,"We investigated the potential role of the co-substrate, thiocyanate (SCN–), in modulating the catalytic activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and other members of the mammalian peroxidase superfamily (lactoperoxidase (LPO) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO)). Pre-incubation of SCN– with MPO generates a more complex biological setting, because SCN– serves as either a substrate or inhibitor, causing diverse impacts on the MPO heme iron microenvironment. Consistent with this hypothesis, the relationship between the association rate constant of nitric oxide binding to MPO-Fe(III) as a function of SCN– concentration is bell-shaped, with a trough comparable with normal SCN– plasma levels. Rapid kinetic measurements indicate that MPO, EPO, and LPO Compound I formation occur at rates slower than complex decay, and its formation serves to simultaneously catalyze SCN– via 1e– and 2e– oxidation pathways. For the three enzymes, Compound II formation is a fundamental feature of catalysis and allows the enzymes to operate at a fraction of their possible maximum activities. MPO and EPO Compound II is relatively stable and decays gradually within minutes to ground state upon H2O2 exhaustion. In contrast, LPO Compound II is unstable and decays within seconds to ground state, suggesting that SCN– may serve as a substrate for Compound II. Compound II formation can be partially or completely prevented by increasing SCN– concentration, depending on the experimental conditions. Collectively, these results illustrate for the first time the potential mechanistic differences of these three enzymes. A modified kinetic model, which incorporates our current findings with the mammalian peroxidases classic cycle, is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2133162113,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and hypothalamic neuronal histamine suppress food intake, a target of leptin action in the brain. This study examined the interactions of GLP-1, CRH, and histamine downstream from the leptin-signaling pathway in regulating feeding behavior. Infusion of GLP-1 into the third cerebral ventricle (i3vt) at a dose of 1 mug significantly decreased the initial 1 h cumulative food intake in rats as compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) controls. The GLP-1-induced suppression of feeding was partially attenuated by intraperitoneal pretreatment with alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (FMH), a specific suicide inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase, which depletes hypothalamic neuronal histamine. Pretreatment with alpha-helical CRH (10 microg/rat, i3vt), a nonselective CRH antagonist, abolished the GLP-1-induced suppression of feeding completely. I3vt infusion of GLP-1 increased the CRH content and histamine turnover assessed using the pargyline-induced accumulation of tele-methyl histamine (t-MH), a major metabolite of neuronal histamine, in the hypothalamus. The central infusion of CRH also induced the increase of histamine turnover and CRH receptor type 1 was localized on the cell body of histamine neuron. Pretreatment with exendin(9-39), a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, attenuated the leptin-induced increase in CRH content of the hypothalamus. Finally, i3vt infusion of leptin also increased histamine turnover in the hypothalamus. Pretreatment with exendin(9-39), alpha-helical CRH or both antagonists attenuated the leptin-induced responses of t-MH levels in the hypothalamus. These results suggest that CRH or hypothalamic neuronal histamine mediates the GLP-1-induced suppression of feeding behavior, that CRH mediates GLP-1 signaling to neuronal histamine and that a functional link from GLP-1 to neuronal histamine via CRH constitutes the leptin-signaling pathway regulating feeding behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2132945692,"Ryanodine receptors (RyRs), intracellular calcium release channels essential for skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction, are also expressed in various types of smooth muscle cells. In particular, recent studies have suggested that in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) provoked by spasmogens, stored calcium release by the cardiac isoform of RyR (RyR2) contributes to the calcium response that leads to airway constriction (bronchoconstriction). Here we report that mouse ASMCs also express the skeletal muscle and brain isoforms of RyRs (RyR1 and RyR3, respectively). In these cells, RyR1 is localized to the periphery near the cell membrane, whereas RyR3 is more centrally localized. Moreover, RyR1 and/or RyR3 in mouse airway smooth muscle also appear to mediate bronchoconstriction caused by the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol. Inhibiting all RyR isoforms with ≥200 μm ryanodine attenuated the graded carbachol-induced contractile responses of mouse bronchial rings and calcium responses of ASMCs throughout the range of carbachol used (50 nm to ≥3 μm). In contrast, inhibiting only RyR1 and RyR3 with 25 μm dantrolene attenuated these responses caused by high (>500 nm) but not by low concentrations of carbachol. These data suggest that, as the stimulation of muscarinic receptor in the airway smooth muscle increases, RyR1 and/or RyR3 also mediate the calcium response and thus bronchoconstriction. Our findings provide new insights into the complex calcium signaling in ASMCs and suggest that RyRs are potential therapeutic targets in bronchospastic disorders such as asthma.

These channels are so named because they bind specifically to the plant alkaloid ryanodine that was used to isolate them (3Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RyRs and the other family of intracellular Ca2+ release channels, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), may co-express in the same cell type (1Berridge M.J.

These two families of ion channels mediate many cellular processes by releasing signaling messenger Ca2+ from intracellular stores into cytosolic compartments in response to extracellular stimuli (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). The physiological roles and regulatory mechanisms of RyRs are best characterized in skeletal and cardiac muscles in which RyRs are essential for muscle contraction (4Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). RyR1 and RyR2 are the predominant RyR isoforms in skeletal and cardiac muscles, respectively. In these tissues, RyRs are localized to specialized regions of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) juxtaposing tubular invaginations of cell membrane known as t-tubules. During excitation-contraction coupling, depolarization of the cell membrane causes voltage-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels in t-tubules to activate nearby RyRs via either direct physical coupling (in skeletal muscle) (2Meissner G.

The latter mechanism is referred to as Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. The massive release of Ca2+ from SR by RyRs then initiates a cascade of cellular events that result in muscle contraction.

Analogously, a series of recent studies using airway smooth muscles from human, equine, and murine tracheal tissues have suggested that many airway spasmogens such as histamine, bradykinin, and muscarinic receptor agonists also increase the synthesis of the putative RyR agonist cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR) from NAD+ by cADP-ribosyl cyclase(s) (35Deshpande D.A.

In ASMCs, cADPR appears to cause a specific RyR2 accessory protein, FKBP 12.6, to dissociate from RyR2, thereby provoking RyR2 to release stored Ca2+ (37Wang Y.X. Zheng Y.M. Mei Q.B. Wang Q.S. Collier M.L. Fleischer S. Xin H.B. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C538-C546Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The effect of cADPR on RyR2 may be synergized by the initial increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) (40Meszaros L.G. Bak J. Chu A. Nature. 1993; 364: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) mobilized by IP3Rs and other plasmalemmal Ca2+ channels. Because all three RyR isoforms have been found to be co-expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (15Neylon C.B. Richards S.M. Larsen M.A. Agrotis A. Bobik A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we assessed whether RyR isoforms other than RyR2 are expressed in ASMCs and whether these isoforms are also involved in spasmogen-induced bronchoconstriction. Here we report that RyR1 and RyR3 are also expressed in the mouse ASMCs. Our immunofluorescence studies indicate that RyR1 and RyR3 are distributed to different compartments within these cells: RyR1 appears to localize to the periphery near the cell membrane, whereas RyR3 is centrally localized to the perinuclear region. Moreover, our studies of mouse ASMCs and bronchial rings exposed to the prototypic airway spasmogen/muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol indicate that RyR1 and/or RyR3 also mediate the Ca2+ response and thus bronchoconstriction as the level of muscarinic receptor stimulation increases. Our findings that suggest different subcellular localizations of RyR isoforms in ASMCs as well as the involvement of multiple RyR isoforms in muscarinic receptor agonist-induced Ca2+ response provide new insights into the complex Ca2+ signaling in ASMCs. Materials—Mouse monoclonal anti-RyR1 IgM was obtained from Upstate (Waltham, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-RyR2 IgG was obtained from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). A rabbit polyclonal IgG raised against a 13-amino acid region specific for RyR3 and a C-terminal cysteine (KKRRRGQKVEKPEC) was prepared as described previously (41Protasi F. Takekura H. Wang Y. Chen S.R. Meissner G. Allen P.D. Franzini-Armstrong C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2494-2508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). [3H]Ryanodine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cy3-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-smooth muscle-specific α-actin IgG, ryanodine, dantrolene, and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., unless specified otherwise. Isolation of Mouse Bronchi—Male C57/BL6 mice (age, 11–12 weeks; ∼25 g) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Each animal was sacrificed after being anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg). The heart and lungs were then removed en bloc and immersed in modified Krebs buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4), and main bronchi (second generation) and lobar bronchi (third generation) were isolated under microscopic dissection. Adventitial layers were then removed. Immunoblot Analyses to Detect RyRs in the Mouse Airway and Verify the Specificities of Individual Anti-RyR Antibodies—Second and third generation bronchi from eight mice were pooled and homogenized in a buffer consisting of 320 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using a hand-held tissue homogenizer. Microsomal fractions enriched in RyRs were prepared from the homogenate as described previously (42Flucher B.E. Conti A. Takeshima H. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of microsomal protein samples were separated by 3–8% Tris acetate SDS-PAGE under reducing condition and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. The membranes were first blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS at 24 °C for 1 h. Following probing with a mouse monoclonal anti-RyR1 IgM (1 ng/μl) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-RyR3 IgG (1:500), the blots were developed using a Vectastain ABC-AmP Western blot detection kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). To verify the specificity of each anti-RyR antibody for the corresponding RyR isoform, tissue homogenates from mouse hind leg skeletal muscle (10 μg/lane), heart (10 μg/lane), and brain (30 μg/lane) that express RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, respectively (brain also expresses RyR2), were used in a separate immunoblot analysis. Isolation of Mouse ASMCs—The isolation of second and third generation mouse bronchi was performed as described above, except that modified Krebs buffer and the subsequent buffers used for isolating ASMCs all passed through 0.22 μm Syrfil-MF filters (Whatman) and contained 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, and 1% antimycotic antibiotics (Invitrogen). The airways were cut open longitudinally, and the epithelium was rubbed off gently using a cotton tip. The smooth muscle layer was then minced in Ca2+-reduced (20 μm) Hanks' balanced salt solution, followed by digestion in Ca2+-reduced Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1000 units/ml type II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ), 10 units/ml papain, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min at 37 °C. The partially digested ASMCs were then centrifuged at 600 × g for 1 min, resuspended in Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution, and gently triturated using a long glass pipette until a large number of elongated cells were observed (43Zhang W.M. Yip K.P. Lin M.J. Shimoda L.A. Li W.H. Sham J.S. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L680-L690Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). ASMCs were then centrifuged, collected, and resuspended in M199 media with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. These ASMCs were allowed to grow in the same media over 5–6 days under standard culture conditions before they were detached from the flask with 0.25% trypsin/1.0 mm EDTA for subculture. ASMCs after one or two passages were used in subsequent studies. The homogeneity of ASMCs was assessed using a mouse monoclonal anti-smooth muscle-specific α-actin IgG (see below). RT-PCR Analyses of RyR Isoforms in Mouse Airways and ASMCs— After removing adventitial tissues, second and third generation bronchi from each animal were pooled and immersed in RNAlater stabilization solution (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA) and homogenized using a hand-held tissue homogenizer. In addition, mouse hind leg skeletal muscle, heart, and brain tissues that served as positive control tissues for RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, respectively, were also homogenized in the same fashion. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Midi kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Similarly, 7–9 day-old cultured mouse ASMCs (∼5 × 105) after one or two passages were first detached from culture flasks with 0.25% trypsin/1.0 mm EDTA at room temperature for 5 min, centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min, washed with M199 media twice, and preserved in RNAlater solution. After homogenization, total RNA was extracted from ASMCs using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. The RT-PCR protocol used to amplify target sequences for each mouse RyR isoform and β-actin that served as internal control was described previously (16Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences and the lengths of the expected PCR products (in parentheses after each primer pair) for each primer pair were as follows: RyR1, GAAGGTTCTGGACAAACACGGG (forward) and TCGCTCTTGTTGTAGAATTTGCGG (reverse) (435 bp); RyR2, GAATCAGTGAGTTACTGGGCATGG (forward) and CTGGTCTCTGAGTTCTCCAAAAGC (reverse) (658 bp); RyR3, AGAAGAGGCCAAAGCAGAGG (forward) and GGAGGCCAACGGTCAGA (reverse) (269 bp); and β-actin, TGTATGCCTCTGGTCGTACCAC (forward) and ACAGAGTACTTGCGCTCAGGAG (reverse) (592 bp). The RT-PCR products over 35 cycles of amplification were resolved by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels, visualized on a UV transilluminator, digitally photographed, and analyzed using XCAP software (Epix Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). The product ratios of target/β-actin were used to assess the relative expression of each RyR isoform mRNA in the mouse airway and in cultured ASMCs. Immunofluorescence Studies of RyRs in Mouse ASMCs—Primary mouse ASMCs after one passage were cultured in Lab-Tek slide II system (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) for 7 days. The cells were first washed with PBS (pH 7.4) twice and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS two more times, the remaining paraformaldehyde was then quenched with 0.75% glycine in PBS for 30 min (43Zhang W.M. Yip K.P. Lin M.J. Shimoda L.A. Li W.H. Sham J.S. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L680-L690Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Afterward, the cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized in 0.1% SDS and 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 30 min, and probed with individual antibody specific for each RyR isoform in 1% goat serum/PBS for 1 h. The dilutions for each of these antibodies were 1 ng/μl, 10 ng/μl, and 1:1000 for anti-RyR1, anti-RyR2, and anti-RyR3, respectively. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with the corresponding fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibody (7.5 ng/μl) in 1% goat serum/PBS for 1 h. Before washing and mounting on Prolong Antifade solution (Molecular Probes), cells were counter-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, which stained the nuclei. In a few experiments, a goat polyclonal anti-RyR3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and TRITC-conjugated donkey antigoat IgG were used to confirm the cellular distribution of RyR3 in ASMCs. Each experiment contained at least one control in which only the primary antibody was omitted. The homogeneity of ASMCs was assessed separately in cells that were probed with a Cy3-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-smooth muscle-specific α-actin IgG and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The slides were examined and digitally photographed using an epifluorescent microscope (Olympus BX60) equipped with UPlanFl 20–100× objectives and a mercury lamp. To assess the relative cellular distribution of RyR1 and RyR3 in mouse ASMCs, in certain studies mouse ASMCs were double-labeled with both mouse monoclonal anti-RyR1 IgM and rabbit polyclonal anti-RyR3 IgG. The prepared slides were examined using the epifluorescent microscope and a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscopy system attached to an Axiovert 100 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Argon and helium/neon lasers provided the excitation light beams (488 and 543 nm, respectively) for the confocal microscopy system. The green (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and orange (TRITC) emissions were filtered (515–540- and 585–615-nm bandpass filters, respectively), and images (512 × 512 pixels) obtained with a 63× objective (Plan-Neofluar) were recorded using LSM Image software. Carbachol-induced Contractile Responses of Isolated Mouse Bronchial Rings—Four bronchial rings (inner diameter, ∼0.5 mm; length, ∼2 mm) cut from second and third generation bronchi from each mouse were studied in parallel. Each bronchial ring was mounted horizontally on two tungsten triangles (diameter of tungsten wire, ∼100 μm) and submerged in Krebs buffer in a thermostatted organ bath constantly bubbled with a pre-mixed gas consisting of 20% O2, 5% CO2 and balance N2 (44Garssen J. Van Loveren H. Van Der Vliet H. Nijkamp F.P. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1990; 24: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The temperature in the organ bath was maintained at 37 °C. The two tungsten triangles (and thus the bronchial ring) were suspended between a stainless steel wire hook connected to a Grass FT-03 force displacement transducer (West Warwick, RI) and a glass hook inside the organ bath that served as an anchor. An optimal resting tension of 0.3 g was applied to each ring during the initial equilibration period of 30 min. The bronchial rings were then constricted stepwise with 50 and 80 mm KCl (final concentration) over 20 min to determine the viability of bronchial rings and establish references for comparison. Approximately 30 min after removing excess KCl, bronchial rings were treated stepwise with 10 nm to 3 μm cumulative doses of carbachol (>3 μm carbachol did not produce higher contractile responses) at 5–8-min intervals that allowed the contractile responses (isometric tensions) of bronchial rings after each carbachol challenge to reach steady state. In specified experiments, an inhibitor of RyRs (ryanodine dissolved in Krebs buffer or dantrolene dissolved in Me2SO) was added to the organ bath 20 min before the stepwise addition of carbachol. In a typical study, two of the bronchial rings were pre-treated with a RyR inhibitor, whereas the other two rings that served as concurrent controls were pre-treated with equal volumes of delivery vehicle. Increases in isometric tension were amplified (Grass DC pre/amplifier model 7DAF) and recorded digitally (Polyview software; Grass-Telefactor). The increases in steady-state isometric tension of mouse bronchial rings caused by cumulative doses of carbachol were normalized against individual ring increases in isometric tensions generated by 80 mm KCl (higher concentrations of KCl did not cause further constriction in mouse bronchial rings). Carbachol-induced Calcium Responses of Mouse ASMCs—Mouse ASMCs after one or two passages in M199 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum were grown over ∼7 days in a culture coverslip/dish (MatTek, Ashland, MA) designed for live cell imaging. Mouse ASMCs were first loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester in M199 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min and then washed with HEPES-buffered Tyrode solution (145 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) three times to remove excess Ca2+ indicator. The culture dish was then placed onto a stage mounted on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000). After pre-treatment with 200 μm ryanodine, 25 μm dantrolene, or the delivery vehicle for 5 min, increased doses of carbachol (10 nm to 10 μm, cumulative concentrations) were introduced to ASMCs stepwise at 5–7-min intervals. Fluorescence measurements were performed under ambient temperature (21 °C) on small groups of dispersed, elongated cells viewed with a Nikon UV-Fluor 40× oil immersion objective (∼4–5 cells were studied in each experiment). These ASMCs were excited alternatively at 340 and 380 nm using a Lambda DG4 filtering system (Sutter Instruments) that provided rapid excitation filter changes. Illumination was provided by a xenon arc lamp. Emitted fluorescence was filtered by a 490–530-nm bandpass filter and captured on a Cool SNAP HQ charge-coupled device camera. Video images were digitized onto a computer and analyzed using MetaMorph/MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Ratiometric Ca2+ images were generated at 1-s intervals. For each cell, Ca2+ responses to stepwise carbachol challenges were reflected as a change in fluorescence ratio (F340/F380) of Fu"
https://openalex.org/W2024254656,"Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, a critical determinant for cell cycle progression, is an important regulation target of mitogenic signals during arterial injury. In this study, we show in rat aortic smooth muscle cells that PDGF-BB down-regulated p27 protein and mRNA in an ERK-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of ERK, but not other subtypes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, prevented the reduction of p27 protein and mRNA. Conversely, direct activation of ERK via adenovirus-mediated expression of a constitutively active form of MEK led to a reduction of p27 protein and mRNA, further supporting the central role of ERK in regulation of p27 expression. Rapamycin, which potently inhibited PDGF-induced activation of p70 S6 kinase as well as proliferation of smooth muscle cells, did not alter the expression of p27. To delineate the molecular mechanism underlying the p27 down-regulation, we examined the effect of PDGF-BB on p27 promoter activity as well as mRNA stability. Stimulation with PDGF-BB significantly shortened the half-life of p27 mRNA without affecting its promoter activity. To further understand the PDGF-stimulated p27 mRNA turnover, we inserted the 5'- and/or 3'-untranslated regions of p27 cDNA into a non-PDGF-responsive luciferase gene. Only those chimeric genes that contained the 3'-untranslated region responded to PDGF-BB with reduced expression. Moreover, inhibition of ERK completely prevented the effect of PDGF on the chimera expression. In summary, our data suggest that p27 is down-regulated by PDGF-BB in vascular smooth muscle cells through an ERK-dependent posttranscriptional mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1979632388,"Regulation of poly(A) tail length during mRNA 3′-end formation requires a specific poly(A)-binding protein in addition to the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. The mechanism that controls polyadenylation in mammals is well understood and involves the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1. In contrast, poly(A) tail length regulation is poorly understood in yeast. Previous studies have suggested that the major cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein Pab1p acts as a length control factor in conjunction with the Pab1p-dependent poly(A) nuclease PAN, to regulate poly(A) tail length in an mRNA specific manner. In contrast, we recently showed that Nab2p regulates polyadenylation during de novo synthesis, and its nuclear location is more consistent with a role in 3′-end processing than that of cytoplasmic Pab1p. Here, we investigate whether PAN activity is required for de novo poly(A) tail synthesis. Components required for mRNA 3′-end formation were purified from wild-type and pan mutant cells. In both situations, 3′-end formation could be reconstituted whether Nab2p or Pab1p was used as the poly(A) tail length control factor. However, polyadenylation was more efficient and physiologically more relevant in the presence of Nab2p as opposed to Pab1p. Moreover, cell immunofluorescence studies confirmed that PAN subunits are localized in the cytoplasm which suggests that cytoplasmic Pab1p and PAN may act at a later stage in mRNA metabolism. Based on these findings, we propose that Nab2p is necessary and sufficient to regulate poly(A) tail length during de novo synthesis in yeast.

Eukaryotic mRNA 3′-end formation is a two-step reaction (reviewed in Refs. 1Edmonds M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 285-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wahle E. Rüegsegger U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 277-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA polymerase II-transcribed mRNA precursor is first cleaved in its 3′-untranslated region and the upstream fragment is subsequently polyadenylated. The mechanism and the machinery involved in this processing have been well conserved through evolution. Human and yeast share similarities in the reaction mechanism and in the composition of the implicated machinery. In mammals, the cleavage reaction can be recapitulated in vitro in the presence of cleavage factors I and II (CF Im and CF IIm), 1The abbreviations used are: CF Im and CF IIm, mammalian cleavage factors I and II; CPSF, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor; PAP, poly(A) polymerase (mammalian); PABPN1, mammalian nuclear poly(A)-binding protein 1; Pab1p, yeast poly(A)-binding protein 1; CF IA and CF IB, yeast cleavage factors IA and IB; PAN, yeast Pab1p-dependent poly(A) nuclease; TAP, tandem affinity purification; CYC1, iso-1-cytochrome c precursor RNA; nt, nucleotide. the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), and the poly(A) polymerase (PAP). Controlled poly(A) tail synthesis requires PAP, CPSF, and the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPN1) (4Rüegsegger U. Blank D. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 5Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2800-2808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mammalian poly(A) tails are synthesized to an average length of 250 adenosine residues. PAP alone does not have any pronounced specificity with regard to the RNA substrate and is poorly active on its own. Its activity is stimulated by two factors, CPSF, which binds to the highly conserved element AAUAAA, and PABPN1, which interacts with the growing poly(A) tail. The combined activity of both stimulatory factors leads to fully processive elongation such that a complete poly(A) tail can be synthesized without dissociation of the polymerase. Once poly(A) tails have reached ∼250 nucleotides, elongation terminates by switching from a processive to a slower distributive mode. Although the exact mechanism that controls poly(A) tail length is unclear, one possibility is that once 250 adenosine residues have been polymerized, disruption of the polyadenylation complex PAP-CPSF-PABPN1 takes place perhaps because the tail is too long to mediate interactions between the three components of the complex (5Wahle E.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Poly(A) tail length control in S. cerevisiae is poorly understood, and there is a controversy about which factors are required. In yeast, poly(A) tails are shorter with an average length of about 70 adenosine residues. The two steps of mRNA 3′-end formation require the cleavage factors IA (CF IA) and IB (CF IB or Nab4p/Hrp1p) and the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) containing the poly(A) polymerase (Pap1p), which is dispensable for the cleavage step of the reaction (7Minvielle-Sebastia L. Beyer K. Krecic A.M. Hector R.E. Swanson M.S. Keller W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7454-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Poly(A) tail length control can be reconstituted in vitro in the presence of these three factors and a poly(A)-binding protein. It was initially suggested that the major cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein Pab1p was responsible for the poly(A) tail length control during de novo synthesis by inhibiting Pap1p activity (8Lingner J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3694-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by several observations. First, Pab1p co-purifies with CF IA and specifically interacts with the Rna15p subunit using either two-hybrid analysis or co-immunoprecipitation and PAB1 is a multicopy suppressor of rna15–2, coding for a subunit of CF IA. Second, poly(A) tails are at least 50 nt longer in vitro when the mRNA precursor is incubated in the pab1Δ mutant extracts. Third, complementation with recombinant Pab1p restores normal length control to the pab1Δ extracts but also induces a shortening of the transcript (9Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Wiederkehr T.

It has been suggested that Pab1p acts by stimulating the poly(A) nuclease PAN, which might balance excessive growth of poly(A) tails by trimming them from the 3′-end (11Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Deadenylation is the first step in the general mRNA turnover in eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 12Parker R. Song H. Nat.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Pan2p is the catalytic subunit and is a member of the RNaseD superfamily, while Pan3p is a positive regulator of PAN activity. Previously, poly(A) tail length control was thought to involve PAN in an mRNA-dependent manner (11Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). More recently, the PAN complex was suggested to be a component of the nuclear pre-mRNA 3′-end processing machinery together with CF IA, CF IB, and CPF (16Mangus D.A. Evans M.C. Agrin N.S. Smith M.

We have shown previously that the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein Nab2p specifically controls poly(A) tail length in vivo and in vitro in yeast (18Hector R.E. Nykamp K.R. Dheur S. Anderson J.T.

In this report, we investigated whether PAN might play an additional role in de novo poly(A) tail synthesis in vitro. Yeast Strains—The pan2Δ pan3Δ strain (YAS1944) has been described elsewhere (15Brown C.E. Tarun S.Z. Boeck R. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The pab1 deletion is rescued by deletion of RPL46 in the strain YAS394 (19Sachs A. Deardorff J.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Strains expressing the C-terminally tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged Pan2p (YSD7) or Pan3p (YSD8) were constructed in BMA64 (ade2–1 leu2–3,112 ura3–1 trp1Δ his3–11,15 can1–100) (20Baudin-Baillieu A. Guillemet E. Cullin C. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1997; 13: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) according to Rigaut et al. (21Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Rna15p and Fip1p were N-terminally TAP-tagged either in the wild-type strain BMA64 (YSD12 and YSD10, respectively) or in the pan2Δ pan3Δ strain YAS1944 (YSD9 and YSD11, respectively) according to Dheur et al. 2S. Dheur, F. Voisinet-Hakil, L. Minvielle-Sebastia, manuscript in preparation. This N-terminal TAP-tagging method was performed by integrating at the chromosomal locus using a cassette which adds a TAP-tag identical to that described previously (21Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Strains expressing both N-terminally TAP-tagged Rna15p and Fip1p were also constructed in either the wild-type BMA64 (YSD13) or the pan2Δ pan3Δ strain YAS1944 (YSD14). In Vitro 3′-End Processing Assays—Polyadenylation-competent extracts were prepared using a spheroplast procedure (22Butler J.S. Sadhale P.P. Platt T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2599-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tandem affinity purification of CF IA and CPF was performed according to Rigaut et al. (21Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation were assayed essentially as previously described (7Minvielle-Sebastia L. Beyer K. Krecic A.M. Hector R.E. Swanson M.S. Keller W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7454-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1994; 266: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, polyadenylation in cell extracts was assayed at 30 °C with 20 μg of extract and stopped at 30, 60, or 90 min by addition of proteinase K. For reconstitution assays with purified factors, reactions contained either 1 μl of CF IA (TAP-Rna15p) + 1 μl of CPF (TAP-Fip1p) or 2 μl of [CF IA + CPF] (TAP-Rna15p and TAP-Fip1p) supplemented with 20 ng of recombinant Nab4p (7Minvielle-Sebastia L. Beyer K. Krecic A.M. Hector R.E. Swanson M.S. Keller W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7454-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and either 25–400 ng of recombinant Pab1p (kind gift of Alan Sachs) or 40–120 ng of recombinant Nab2p (18Hector R.E. Nykamp K.R. Dheur S. Anderson J.T. Non P.J. Urbinati C.R. Wilson S.M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Swanson M.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1800-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For the time course experiment, a 10-fold reaction mixture containing 20 μl of [CF IA + CPF] and 200 ng of recombinant Nab4p was supplemented with either 2 μg of recombinant Pab1p or 1.2 μg of recombinant Nab2p. This mixture was preincubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and polyadenylation was initiated by addition of labeled transcript. Aliquots were withdrawn at indicated times and the reaction was stopped and analyzed on a 40 cm long 6% polyacrylamide-8.3 m urea gel. For the inactivation of Nab2p by Kap104p experiment, 0.5 μg of Nab2p was preincubated with increasing amounts of Kap104p (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 μg) for 15 min at 30 °C in the buffer used for the 3′-end processing assays. Recombinant Kap104p was prepared as described (24Lee D.C. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29031-29037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After incubation, the recombinant proteins were added to standard processing reactions and performed as described above. Co-immunopurification and Immunoblotting—For immunodepletion analysis using the pab1Δ (YAS394) polyadenylation-competent extracts, 200 μg of extract were incubated with either anti-Nab2p 3F2, anti-Kap104p 1D12, anti-Nab4p 3H1, or anti-Pub1p 4C3 monoclonal antibodies prebound to rabbit anti-mouse antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunopurification was performed for 30 min at 4 °C in 25 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm ρ-aminobenzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm Pefabloc. Aliquots of the supernatant were analyzed by immunoblotting as described (25Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), using a 1:500 dilution of anti-Nab2p 3F2 or anti-Kap104p 1D12 antibodies and a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Cellular Immunofluorescence—The subcellular distributions of TAP-tagged Pan2p, Pan3p, and Rna15p were examined by cell immunofluorescence as described previously (18Hector R.E. Nykamp K.R. Dheur S. Anderson J.T. Non P.J. Urbinati C.R. Wilson S.M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Swanson M.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1800-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) using an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 mot plus microscope equipped with a ×100 fluorescence/differential contrast objective and images were captured with a Zeiss monochrome digital camera. In Vitro Synthesized mRNA Poly(A) Tails Are Not Aberrantly Long in PAN-deficient Cell Extracts Compared with Pab1p-deficient Extracts—To evaluate the putative involvement of the PAN nuclease during in vitro poly(A) tail synthesis, we performed a time course experiment and characterized the 3′-end processing activity of extracts prepared from either the wild-type, the pan2Δ pan3Δ, or the pab1Δ mutant strains. The 3′-untranslated region of the mRNA precursor CYC1 was transcribed in vitro in the presence of a radiolabeled nucleotide and then incubated with the different yeast extracts. As shown in Fig. 1, the CYC1 precursor (lane 1, shown as a gray and white rectangle and running with the 309-nt marker) was cleaved at the normal poly(A) site. The resulting upstream fragment (running between the 180- and 190-nt marker bands and represented as a gray box) was polyadenylated in wild-type extracts. This polyadenylation reaction resulted in poly(A) tails with an average length of 60 adenosine residues, which ran above the upstream fragment in the region of the 242-nt marker (lanes 2 and 3, gray box followed by AAAA). Subsequently, poly(A) tails were shortened (Fig. 1, lane 4). This time course assay could reflect an equilibrium between synthesis and degradation that occurs within the first hour, which is followed by a net deadenylation because of a reduced polyadenylation rate. Alternatively, this experiment could highlight a two-step reaction in which trimming would be the final processing step that follows polymerization. Fig. 1 shows that the PAN-deficient extracts displayed a polyadenylation activity that was not dramatically different from that observed with wild-type extracts (Fig. 1, compare lanes 5–7 with lanes 2–4). Although cleavage activity was less efficient than that of the wild-type extract, this result should be interpreted with caution, since cleavage efficiency is highly dependent upon extract preparation and differs from one extract to another with no obvious correlation to the strain used. 3S. Dheur and L. Minvielle-Sebastia, unpublished observation. Poly(A) tails in the pan mutant extracts were slightly longer, but their length was rather constant with time, which is the most striking difference with the wild-type extracts (Fig. 1, compare lane 4 with lane 7). On the other hand, the pab1 mutant extracts were noticeably more affected in poly(A) tail length control (Fig. 1, lanes 8–10). In this case, the average tail length was ∼50 nt longer, although very long tails were detectable. Because of this increasing length, the polyadenylated product overlapped with the precursor in lanes 8–10 of Fig. 1. Tail length also remained constant with time. Altogether, these results suggested that Pab1p restricts poly(A) tail length only to a certain extent in vitro and that the Pab1p-dependent nuclease PAN does not play a direct role in de novo poly(A) tail synthesis but might be involved in a trimming activity that occurs following polyadenylation. However, several observations argue against a role for Pab1p in poly(A) tail length control in vivo. First, Pab1p is an abundant cytoplasmic protein that is very weakly detected in the nucleus (25Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Second, Pab1p is a major contaminant of the complexes purified from yeast. For instance, it was present in 10% of the tandem affinity purified complexes in the large scale approach reported in Gavin et al. (26Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T. Gnau V. Bauch A. Bastuck S. Huhse B. Leutwein C. Heurtier M.A. Copley R.R. Edelmann A. Querfurth E. Rybin V. Drewes G. Raida M. Bouwmeester T. Bork P. Seraphin B. Kuster B. Neubauer G. Superti-Furga G. Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4010) Google Scholar). Third, the very long tails observed in vitro with pab1 mutant extracts do not reflect the in vivo situation where tails are only 3–20 nt longer in the absence of Pab1p (27Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These arguments led us to consider the possibility that the poly(A) tail length regulatory factor in vivo might have been lost or inactivated during extract preparation. The Poly(A) Tail Length Regulatory Function of Nab2p in Vitro Might Be Obscured because of Its Binding to the Nuclear Transport Factor Kap104p during Extract Preparation—We recently provided evidence that the hnRNP Nab2p was another candidate for controlling mRNA poly(A) tail synthesis in vivo and in vitro (18Hector R.E. Nykamp K.R. Dheur S. Anderson J.T. Non P.J. Urbinati C.R. Wilson S.M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Swanson M.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1800-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Unlike Pab1p, Nab2p is a predominantly nuclear protein (25Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Paddy M.R. Swedlow J.R. Swanson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that plays a dual role in the termination of mRNA polyadenylation and nuclear export. Nab2p is a shuttling protein that is reimported to the nucleus by way of its association with the karyopherin Kap104p (24Lee D.C. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29031-29037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P. Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Kap104p and Nab2p form a complex in the cytosol and binding of Kap104p to Nab2p destabilizes Nab2p-RNA interactions (24Lee D.C. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29031-29037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because the poly(A) tail regulatory activity of Nab2p is dependent on its RNA-binding properties, we speculated that Kap104p binds to free Nab2p in extracts resulting in an inhibition of its poly(A) tail regulatory activity. However, the abundant poly(A)-binding protein Pab1p masked the loss of active Nab2p in extracts as it could substitute for it in polyadenylation assays (9Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Wiederkehr T. Strahm Y. Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7897-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Amrani N. Minet M. Le Gouar M. Lacroute F. Wyers F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3694-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As a result, the loss of Nab2p activity during extract preparation would therefore explain the complete absence of poly(A) tail length control in pab1Δ extracts. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether the anti-Kap104p monoclonal antibody 1D12 (mAb 1D12) could immunodeplete Nab2p from 3′-end processing extracts. In this assay, pab1Δ extracts were immunodepleted with several antibodies, and the presence of Nab2p and Kap104p in the antigen-depleted supernatants was analyzed by Western blot (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2). As anticipated, the anti-Kap104p antibody not only depleted the extracts of Kap104p but also the majority of Nab2p (Fig. 2, lane 3). It also appeared that Kap104p was considerably more abundant than Nab2p, since the anti-Nab2p antibody failed to completely immunodeplete Kap104p from the extracts (Fig. 2, lane 4). As Nab4p is also reimported by Kap104p to the nucleus (24Lee D.C. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29031-29037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), this might correspond to a Kap104p-Nab4p complex as immunodepletion with antibodies directed against Nab4p failed to pull down all Kap104p as well (Fig. 2, lane 5). Neither the anti-Nab4p antibody nor an antibody against the unrelated protein Pub1p led to Nab2p depletion in the extracts (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6, respectively, compared with the mock depleted extract in lane 2). These results suggested that Kap104p binds Nab2p in polyadenylation-competent extracts. This might explain why control of poly(A) tail synthesis was lost in vitro in the pab1Δ extracts, which does not reflect the in vivo situation in the pab1Δ strain (27Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This data supported our previous proposal that Nab2p is the bona fide poly(A) tail length regulatory factor in yeast and that its inactivation by Kap104p was masked by the activity of the abundant poly(A)-binding protein Pab1p in 3′-end processing extracts. The Absence of PAN Does Not Affect the Composition of Purified CF IA and CPF Complexes—If PAN functions in poly(A) tail length control during de novo synthesis, reconstitution of regulated mRNA polyadenylation with 3′-end processing factors purified from extracts lacking this deadenylase should be compromised. Therefore, we purified CF IA and CPF from a pan2Δ pan3Δ strain to recapitulate the pre-mRNA 3′-end processing reaction in vitro in the absence of PAN activity. The two complexes were purified either separately or together from a pan mutant and a wild-type strain using the TAP method (21Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). CF IA and CPF were purified from strains expressing N-terminally TAP-tagged Rna15p (for CF IA purification) and/or TAP-tagged Fip1p (for CPF purification). Purified factors were visualized on silver-stained polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3). The majority of the expected bands corresponding to already identified subunits could be detected (26Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T. Gnau V. Bauch A. Bastuck S. Huhse B. Leutwein C. Heurtier M.A. Copley R.R. Edelmann A. Querfurth E. Rybin V. Drewes G. Raida M. Bouwmeester T. Bork P. Seraphin B. Kuster B. Neubauer G. Superti-Furga G. Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4010) Google Scholar), and no significant difference in the composition of the factors could be found between the wild-type and the pan mutant backgrounds. Normal Cleavage and Polyadenylation of Pre-mRNA Can Be Recapitulated in Vitro with Purified Factors in the Absence of PAN—To evaluate the effect of PAN absence on poly(A) tail formation, we performed in vitro assays with the TAP-purified CF IA and CPF. Their activities were tested in vitro for pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation in combination with recombinant Nab4p (CF IB) and increasing amounts of either recombinant Pab1p or Nab2p (Fig. 4). In the presence of CF IA, CF IB, and CPF, the 3′-untranslated region of CYC1 precursor was cleaved and hyperadenylated (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 8). In these conditions, poly(A) tails were polymerized to a length exceeding 400 nt. Addition of increasing amounts of Pab1p reduced the average tail length to a size similar to that obtained with wild-type cell extracts (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3–7 and 9–13 with lane 14). However, two major bands (under the precursor) and very long tails (running above the precursor and higher than the 622-nt marker) could be observed with high amounts of Pab1p under conditions where cleavage began to be inhibited (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7 and lanes 12 and 13). The two bands were not detected in previous studies where shorter polyacrylamide gels with lower resolution were used. These two major polyadenylated products that appeared with high amounts of Pab1p (Fig. 4, lanes 12 and 13) could have been interpreted as steps in poly(A) degradation. However, it was not dependent on PAN activity, since these bands were also present with the factors purified from panΔ extracts (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7). In general, no significant differences were observed between wild-type and panΔ factor activities (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2–7 with lanes 8–13). Addition of increasing amounts of Nab2p also resulted in a decrease of poly(A) tail length (Fig. 4, lanes 16–20 and 21–25). In contrast to Pab1p, we could observe a smear corresponding to the mature polyadenylated product below the precursor. In addition, the hyperadenylated species running above the precursor were no longer visible (Fig. 4, lanes 20 and 25). The reaction appeared to be more efficient than with Pab1p, since as little as 80 ng of Nab2p could suppress the formation of hyperadenylated products, which differs from the situation found with Pab1p. Noticeably, wild-type and panΔ-purified factors displayed the same activity (Fig. 4, compare lanes 16–20 with lanes 21–25). It is important to mention that the lower levels of the CYC1 precursor remaining"
https://openalex.org/W2040816417,"Homocitrate synthase (HCS) catalyzes one of the regulated steps of the α-aminoadipate pathway for lysine biosynthesis in fungi. The kinetic mechanism of regulation of HCS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Na+ and the feedback inhibitor lysine was studied by measuring the initial rate in the absence and presence of the effectors. The data suggest that Na+ is an activator at low concentrations and an inhibitor at high concentrations and that these effects occur as a result of the monovalent ion binding to two different sites in the free enzyme. Inhibition and activation by Na+ can occur simultaneously, with the net rate of the enzyme determined by Na+/KiNa+ and Na+/Kact, where KiNa+ and Kact are the inhibition and activation constants, respectively. The inhibition by Na+ was eliminated at high concentrations of acetyl-CoA, the second substrate bound, but the activation remained. Fluorescence binding studies indicated that lysine bound with high affinity to its binding site as an inhibitor. The inhibition by lysine was competitive versus α-ketoglutarate and linear in the physiological range of lysine concentrations up to 5 mm. The effects of Na+ and lysine were independent of one another. A model is developed for regulation of HCS that takes into account all of the effects discussed above.

There are two distinct pathways for the biosynthesis of the essential amino acid lysine. The diaminopimelate pathway is common among plants, bacteria, and lower fungi (Phycomycetes or algal fungi). Homocitrate synthase (HCS 1The abbreviations used are: HCS, homocitrate synthase; α-Kg, α-ketoglutarate; DCPIP, dichlorophenolindophenol.1The abbreviations used are: HCS, homocitrate synthase; α-Kg, α-ketoglutarate; DCPIP, dichlorophenolindophenol.; EC 2.3.3.14, 2-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate 2-oxoglutarate-lyase (CoA-acetylating)) is the first and committed enzyme of the α-aminoadipate pathway for the biosynthesis of lysine that is unique to higher fungi (Ascomycetes and Basidomycetes). Pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus (human pathogens) and Magnaporthe grisea (a plant pathogen) use the α-aminoadipate pathway for lysine biosynthesis. The uniqueness of the α-aminoadipate pathway makes it a potential target for the design of antifungal drugs to protect immunocompromised patients (transplant, AIDS, and cancer patients) against opportunistic fungi (1Johansson E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10839-10846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and its interaction with a number of nuclear proteins (Biomolecular Interaction Network Database, available at www.bind.ca) suggest possible additional functions in the nucleus and complex regulation.There are few studies of the regulation of the HCS. In Saccharomycopsis lipolytica, it has been shown that HCS activity is completely inhibited by lysine and some lysine analogs like hydroxylysine and diaminopimelic acid (9Gaillardin G.M. Poirier L. Heslot H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 422: 390-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the case of the enzyme from Penicillium chrysogenum, the inhibition by lysine was shown to be competitive with respect to α-ketoglutarate and pH-dependent with only 20% inhibition by 1 mm lysine at pH 6.6–7.0 (10Jaklitsch W.M. Kubicek C.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that HCS from Thermus thermophilus is highly sensitive to lysine (11Wulandari A.P. Miyazaki J. Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Hoshino T. Yamane H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Regulation of HCS activity by CoA and divalent metal ions has also been reported (12Tracy J. Kohlhaw G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1802-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).In this study, we made use of steady-state kinetic and fluorescence binding studies to probe the kinetics of regulation of cytosolic HCS from S. cerevisiae. Our data suggest that lysine is a competitive inhibitor and that the effects of lysine and Na+ are independent of one another in the regulation of HCS. However, depending on the concentrations of the modulators and substrates, the reaction can be either activated or inhibited. In the accompanying article (24Andi B. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31633-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), theory is developed for regulation by multiple effectors on the basis of the results presented in this work.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. α-Ketoglutarate (α-Kg), dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), AcCoA, lysine, and LiCl were obtained from Sigma. KCl, CsCl, CaCl2, MnCl2, and MgCl2 were from Fisher. (NH4)2SO4 was from Fluka, and NaCl was from EMD Pharmaceuticals.The concentration of AcCoA was adjusted spectrophotometrically (ϵ260 nm = 16.4 mm-1 cm-1). The AcCoA solution in double-distilled H2O is stable, without any significant hydrolysis, for at least 1 month if kept at -21 °C. The concentration of DCPIP preparations was also adjusted spectrophotometrically (ϵ600 nm = 19.1 mm-1 cm-1).Assays of HCS Activity—Cell growth and HCS expression and purification were performed as described previously (13Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 421: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A typical assay for HCS using the DCPIP method followed the directions described previously (13Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 421: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The final volume of the assay was 0.5 ml and contained 50 mm Hepes (adjusted to pH 7.5 with KOH), variable concentrations of α-Kg and AcCoA (∼Km–20Km), and 0.1 mm DCPIP. All assays were carried out at 25 °C. Reactions were thermally equilibrated to allow for completion of the reaction between CoA (in the AcCoA solution) and DCPIP before adding the enzyme to the reaction mixture.To dissolve precipitated α-cyclodextrin in the stabilized HCS suspension (because of its interaction with other buffer components) (13Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 421: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%. An enzyme solution prepared by this method is stable at room temperature for up to 3–4 h, after which the enzyme begins to lose activity.Initial Velocity Studies—Initial velocity patterns were obtained by measuring the initial rate as a function of AcCoA concentration (0.0125–0.125 mm) at a fixed concentration of α-Kg, and the experiment was then repeated at several additional α-Kg concentrations (1–10 mm). An additional initial velocity pattern was also repeated using 0.0125–2.0 mm AcCoA at fixed concentrations of 0.5–10 mm α-Kg. The above initial velocity pattern was then repeated at several different fixed concentrations of the effector (including zero). Concentrations of 0, 25, 100, and 250 mm were used for Na+, whereas concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mm were used for lysine. An initial velocity pattern was also repeated using a high AcCoA concentration (0.5 mm) and 1–10 mm α-Kg at additional lysine concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mm. To study the interaction between Na+ and lysine, the initial rate was measured at a fixed concentration of α-Kg (0.5Kα-Kg ≈ 1.46 mm) and a fixed concentration of AcCoA (2KAcCoA ≈ 0.0125 mm (low) or 100KAcCoA ≈ 0.5 mm (high)) with the lysine concentration varied (0–1 mm) at different fixed concentrations of NaCl (0–250 mm).Fluorescence Binding Studies—Fluorescence spectra were measured as described previously (13Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 421: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Emission spectra (310–400 nm) were measured with the excitation monochromator fixed at 298 nm. Spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer equipped with a circulating water bath to maintain the temperature at 25 °C. Fluorescence quartz cuvettes with a volume of 1 ml and a path length of 1 cm were used to measure sample and blank spectra. Excitation and emission slit widths were set to 1.5 and 5 nm, respectively. Because all of the reagents and buffer components have no absorbance above 310 nm, the inner filter effect is negligible under the conditions used for taking the spectra.The final buffer composition used to measure the spectra contained 55 mm Hepes (adjusted to pH 7.5 with KOH), 150 mm (NH4)2SO4, 25 mm guanidinium chloride, 25 mm α-cyclodextrin, 8 mm KCl, and 5 mm imidazole. All samples contained enzyme at a concentration of 55 μg/ml. The compounds used for fluorescence studies were α-Kg and lysine, which were added sequentially from low to high concentrations to both the blank and sample from a stock solution of 1 m for α-Kg and 1 m and 10 mm for lysine. The final total dilution in each case was 1.07 for α-Kg and 1.02 (10 mm stock solution) and 1.05 (1 m stock solution) for lysine, and all data were corrected for dilution.To calculate the Kd based on the fluorescence intensity, data were fitted to the equation for a rectangular hyperbola (Equation 1),ΔF=ΔFmaxLKd+L(Eq. 1) where ΔF is the change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence upon addition of ligand to enzyme, ΔFmax is the maximum change in fluorescence at infinite ligand concentration, L is the ligand concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant for the enzyme·ligand complex.Because of nonlinearity of the lysine fluorescence data, they were fitted to Equation 2, which represents the sum of two independent saturation curves indicating binding to non-interacting sites,ΔF=ΔFmax1LKd1+L+ΔFmax2LKd2+L(Eq. 2) where ΔFmax1 and ΔFmax2 are the maximum change in fluorescence intensity upon binding of lysine to the first and second classes of binding sites, respectively; and Kd1 and Kd2 are the dissociation constants associated with the binding of lysine to the aforementioned sites.Effect of Monovalent and Divalent Cations on HCS Activity—A fixed concentration of α-Kg (2Kα-Kg ≈ 5 mm) and either a low (5KAcCoA ≈ 0.031 mm) or high (100KAcCoA ≈ 0.5 mm) AcCoA concentration were used with different concentrations of monovalent and divalent cations (0–250 mm). Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ were used as additives to test their effects on HCS activity.Data Analysis—Data were fitted using the appropriate equations and the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm supplied with the EnzFitter program from Biosoft (Cambridge, UK). Rate, kinetic, and dissociation constants and their corresponding standard errors were estimated using a simple, proportional, or statistical robust weighing method (depending on the maximum change in initial rate or ΔF observed in the experiment) for the activity or affinity of the enzyme by fitting the curves to the data in either the absence or presence of inhibitors or ligands. Some simple simulations for some of the equations were carried out using Mathematica Version 5.0.1.0 (Wolfram Research, Inc., Champaign, IL). Derivation of equations and theory are included in the accompanying article (24Andi B. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31633-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Data consistent with a sequential kinetic mechanism were fitted to Equation 3.v=VABKiaKb'+Ka'B+Kb'A+AB(Eq. 3) In Equation 3, ν and V are initial velocity and maximum velocity, respectively; A (α-Kg) and B (AcCoA) are reactant concentrations; Ka′ and Kb′ are Michaelis constants for A and B, respectively; and Kia is the inhibition constant for A (the dissociation constant for EA because HCS has an ordered kinetic mechanism (14Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11790-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)).RESULTSInitial Rate Studies of Lysine Inhibition—To determine what forms of the enzyme bind lysine, the HCS reaction in the presence of lysine was treated as a terreactant (three reactants) reaction (15Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Double-reciprocal initial velocity patterns were obtained upon varying the AcCoA concentration at different fixed levels of α-Kg and zero lysine. This initial velocity pattern was then repeated at different lysine concentrations (Fig. 1, A–D). The crossover points for all double-reciprocal plots are to the left of the ordinate. Graphically, secondary plots were constructed by plotting the slopes (Fig. 2A) or intercepts (Fig. 2B) obtained from the plots in Fig. 1 against the reciprocal of the α-Kg concentration. Note that there was no effect of lysine on the intercept of either the slope or intercept secondary plots Fig. 2 (A and B). Finally, tertiary plots were constructed by plotting the slope from Fig. 2 (A and B) versus the concentration of lysine (Fig. 2, C and D). Estimates of all of the kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting all of the data in Fig. 1 to Equation 4 (see below). We present all of the data in this case so that the method is clear to the reader and so that it may be adapted to other systems. Kinetic parameters are summarized in Table I. Values of Kiα-Kg, Kα-Kg, KAcCoA, and V/Et are identical, within error, to those reported previously (14Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11790-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Secondary and tertiary replots of the data in Fig. 1.

Kubicek C.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, an initial velocity pattern was obtained at a fixed AcCoA concentration (100KAcCoA ≈ 0.5 mm) at varying concentrations of α-Kg and different lysine concentrations (up to 5 mm). The results indicate that, in case of HCS from S. cerevisiae, lysine was a linear inhibitor over this concentration range (data not shown). It should also be noted that the initial rate measured for lysine inhibition studies was affected to some extent by the independent activatory effects of the monovalent cations present in the enzyme stock solution that introduced some (manageable) error in the data analysis.Initial Rate Studies of Sodium Inhibition and Activation— Initial velocity patterns were obtained as described for Fig. 1, with the exception that Na+ replaced lysine. As for lysine, Na+ did not affect the intercept of the secondary replots. The tertiary replots of the slope of the slope replot and the slope of the intercept replot are shown in Fig. 3 (A and B, respectively). At low concentrations of both reactants (Fig. 3A), Na+ exhibited complex behavior, with activation at low concentrations and linear inhibition at high concentrations. At high AcCoA and low α-Kg concentrations, Na+ exhibited only activation. Estimates of kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting all of the initial velocity data (not shown) to Equation 5 (see below), and a summary of the estimates is given in Table I.Fig. 3Tertiary replots of the data (not shown) for Na+ inhibition and activation studies. A, tertiary replot of the slope of the slope versus NaCl concentration; B, tertiary replot of the slope of the intercept versus NaCl concentration.

The rate in the absence of both Na+ and lysine is the frame of reference in these studies. The effect of lysine in the absence of Na+ is given at zero Na+, whereas the effect of Na+ in the absence of lysine is given as the intercepts of Figs. 4A and 5A, and these are replotted in Figs. 4C and 5C. For all conditions, the effects of one of the modulators in the absence of the other are consistent with data obtained in Figs. 1, 2, 3. The interaction between the two modulators is given by the slope replots (Figs. 4B and 5B). The slope is independent, within error, of the concentration of Na+ at a high AcCoA concentration.Fig. 4Interactive effects of Na+ and lysine at low AcCoA. A, plot of the reciprocal initial rate versus lysine concentration at different fixed concentrations of Na+. Rates were measured in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) at 25 °C at low concentrations of AcCoA (0.0125 mm) and α-Kg (1.46 mm) with the lysine concentration varied from 0 to 1 mm at different fixed concentrations of NaCl: 0 mm (♦), 25 mm (▪), 100 mm (▴), and 250 mm (•).

Monovalent cations other than Na+ were less inhibitory at higher concentrations of AcCoA (data not shown), similar to the effect of Na+ (see above). Among the monovalent cations studied, smaller cations (Li+, 60 pm; Na+, 95 pm; K+, 133 pm; and Cs+, 169 pm) showed greater inhibition and lower activation. K+ seems to be the best cation for HCS activity because it had the lowest inhibitory effect. The effect of NH4+ lay between the effects of Li+ and Na+ (data not shown).Fig. 7Effect of monovalent and divalent cations on HCS activity at low reactant concentrations. Conditions were the same as those described for Fig. 4A. The concentrations of the monovalent cations are as indicated for KCl (♦), NaCl (▪), LiCl (▴), and CsCl (•). The inset shows the effect of Mg2+ on HCS activity at low (♦) and high (▪) AcCoA concentrations. The curves were drawn by eye.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Of all of the divalent cations studied (Mn2+, 75 pm; Mg2+, 65 pm; and Ca2+, 100 pm), smaller divalent cations exhibited a higher degree of inhibition and were inhibitory at a low AcCoA concentration. The experiments showed that Mg2+ was much less inhibitory at a lower concentration when used at a high AcCoA concentration (Fig. 7, inset). In general, it seems that the inhibitory effects of all of the monovalent and divalent cations are related to the density of the positive charge on the surface of the ion or the charge-to-mass ratio. The cations with more positive charge density showed greater inhibitory effects on HCS activity.DISCUSSIONInhibition by Lysine—An ordered kinetic mechanism has been proposed for HCS from S. cerevisiae (14Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11790-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As a result of the observation of an E·AcCoA complex, a possibility was raised that the HCS kinetic mechanism could be steady-state random, and this will be addressed below under “The Na+ Effect.” The data in Fig. 1 can thus be interpreted in terms of the enzyme forms along the reaction pathway in an ordered mechanism. The data in Fig. 2 indicate that there was no effect of lysine on the intercept of the slope and intercept replots. The intercept of the slope replot represents the E·α-Kg form of the enzyme, whereas the intercept of the intercept replot represents whatever enzyme form(s) build up at steady state with substrates at saturating concentrations. On the other hand, the slopes of both replots represent free enzyme, and both reflect the inhibition by lysine. Thus, lysine binds to free enzyme to cause inhibition.The overall rate equation for lysine inhibition (up to 5 mm) is given by Equation 4,v=VAB(KiaKb'+Ka'B)1+LysKiLys+Kb'A+AB(Eq. 4) where ν and V are the initial and maximum rates KiaKb′ and Ka′B (representing free enzyme under the conditions of the assay) are multiplied by (1 + Lys/KiLys); A and B are α-Kg and AcCoA concentrations, respectively; Kia, Ka′, and Kb′ are Kiα-Kg, Kα-Kg, and KAcCoA, respectively; Lys is the concentration of lysine; and KiLys is the dissociation constant for the E′·lysine complex. A fit of the all data in Fig. 1 to Equation 4 gives kinetic parameters that are identical to those reported previously and a KiLys for the E′·lysine complex of 550 μm (14Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11790-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Lysine binding to HCS was also measured by fluorescence titration, but a difference was obtained in the magnitude of KiLys, with a value of 550 μm from kinetic studies (Table I) and values of 40 μm and 255 mm from fluorescence titration (Table II). The value of 255 mm likely reflects nonspecific binding of some sort. The value of 40 μm reflects binding to a site with high affinity, but it is an order of magnitude lower than the value obtained from steady-state kinetic studies. Quenching of HCS intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence by KI, CsCl, and acrylamide exhibits downward curved Stern-Volmer plots consistent with at least two different environments for the single tryptophan in HCS (13Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 421: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If lysine binds"

Myosin II molecules associate through their HC tails forming bipolar filaments that interact with actin filaments to form the biologically functional complex. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum contains only a single gene for each of the three myosin II polypeptides. The genes are readily disrupted by homologous recombination (1De Lozanne A.

The CM-loop also contains the TEDS-site (25Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil.

The CM-loop of DdMII extends from Arg397 to Gln407 with Asp403 at the TEDS-rule site (Fig. 1). We found the CM-loop to be essential for growth of Dictyostelium in suspension culture, ConA-induced capping, and development to fruiting bodies. The CM-loop of chicken smooth muscle myosin II could substitute partially for the DdMII loop but the CM-loop of human β-cardiac myosin II almost not at all. Studies of the two chimeric myosins and 19 point mutants in their CM-loops showed good correlation between the effects of CM-loop mutations on development and growth, and both were more sensitive to mutations in the CM-loop than was capping of ConA receptors. There was no overall correlation between the ability of the myosins to support these three biological functions and either the in vitro motility activity or the kcat or Kactin of the actin-activated MgATPase activity of the purified myosins. However, Wt DdMII and the five myosin mutants that restored full biological activity had a higher ratio of kcat/Kactin, a measure of coupling between the actin binding and ATPase sites, than any of the other constructs. The three mutations that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in humans had equivalent, small effects on the biological functions of DdMII, but very different effects on its biochemical activities. The single point mutation A400V in the Wt CM-loop profoundly inhibited, and the reverse mutation V400A in the Sm and Ca CM-loop chimeras strongly enhanced, their biological and biochemical properties. Steady-state MgATPase activities of S1 constructs and full-length myosins were very similar. Transient kinetics showed that interchanging Ala and Val did not substantially affect the ATP binding kinetics of acto-S1, the affinity of acto-S1 for ADP, or the rate of dissociation of ADP from acto-S1, leading to the conclusion that the effects of the Ala/Val, Val/Ala mutations on steady-state ATPase activity resulted from changes in the rate of Pi release from the acto-S1·ADP·Pi complex. In addition, Val at position 400 decreased the affinity of actin for S1 in the absence of nucleotide by as much as 175-fold. Plasmid Construction and Cell Culture—All mutations in the CM-loop were obtained by standard methods using PCR with pTIKL MyD (33Liu X. Ito K. Lee R.J. Uyeda T.Q.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as the template. The S1 heavy chain was truncated at position Glu843 and fused with a FLAG tag, DYKDDDK, at the C terminus to facilitate purification. All sequences were confirmed. The cDNAs in pTIKL were electroporated into HS1 cells (14Egelhoff T.T. Brown S.S. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Individual clones were selected and maintained on plates in the presence of 12 μg/ml geneticin (G418) sulfate (Invitrogen) in HL5 medium containing 60 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin; large scale cultures were grown in the same medium either in conical flasks on a rotary shaker at 145 rpm or on 25×25-cm square plates at 22 °C. Biological Assays—Growth in suspension culture was quantified as described (34Shu S. Liu X. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6499-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) beginning with an initial cell density of 1 × 105 cells/ml for all cell lines. Doubling times were calculated from cell densities after 3 days. To evaluate ConA-induced capping, 30 μg/ml tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated ConA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to washed cells in starvation buffer at room temperature (7Pasternak C.L. Flicker P.F. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Shu S. Liu X. Parent C.A. Uyeda T.Q.P. Korn E.D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4237-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed at 5 and 25 min, permeabilized in -20 °C acetone containing 1% formalin for 15 min (35LeBlanc-Straceski J.M. Fukui Y. Sohn R.L. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 27: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the coverslips were washed and mounted to visualize the ConA caps. Capping stages were scored for 100 cells. To assay development, cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation, washed twice with starvation buffer, and small aliquots of amoebae placed on agar plates in starvation buffer (16Kubalek E.W. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1455-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Shu S. Liu X. Parent C.A. Uyeda T.Q.P. Korn E.D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4237-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Phenotypes were observed and photographed under a dissection microscope after 48 h when development of all cell lines had reached its final stage. The final stage of development was scored for at least 100 aggregates, and the assays were repeated at least two times. Biochemical Assays—Wt and mutant myosins were purified as described (33Liu X. Ito K. Lee R.J. Uyeda T.Q.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and S1s were purified by FLAG-affinity chromatography. Their purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gels, and they were stored in liquid N2 until use. Rabbit muscle actin (36Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Dictyostelium myosin light chain kinase (37Smith S.L. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. Myosin concentrations were determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as standard. S1 concentrations were determined by absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.7 cm2/mg at 280 nm and by the Bradford assay with the same results. Actin concentrations were determined by absorption at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.62 cm2/mg. Steady-state ATPase activity was assayed in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 150 nm myosin head or 150 nm S1, and F-actin at the indicated concentrations. The production of 32Pi was determined (39Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after incubation at 30 °C for 12 min, during which period the reaction rates were constant. Assays of myosin were initiated by addition of monomeric myosin that had been fully phosphorylated by Dictyostelium myosin light chain kinase (38Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as determined by urea-glycerol PAGE. Actin was polymerized in the presence of gelsolin (Sigma) at a 1:60 molar ratio to reduce its viscosity. Curves were fitted to all of the data points using SigmaPlot to determine kcat at saturating concentrations of F-actin and Kactin, the concentration of F-actin required for half-maximal activity. The modified protocol of Sellers et al. (40Sellers J.R. Cuda G. Wang F. Homsher E. Methods Cell Biol. 1993; 39: 3923-3949Google Scholar) was used to determine in vitro motility activity at 30 °C in buffer containing 3 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm ATP. Regulatory light chain phosphorylation was carried out after binding the myosin to the slide by adding Dictyostelium myosin light chain kinase in kinase buffer and incubating for 10 min. Stopped Flow Assays—All stopped flow measurements were done in a SF-2001 stopped flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) at 25 °C in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Pyrene-labeled actin was excited at 365 nm, and the emitted light was selected using a 400-nm long pass cutoff filter. Experimental traces were fitted using KinTek software, Sigma-Plot 2001 and Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software). The DdMII CM-loop Is Essential and Cannot Be Replaced by the CM-loop of Smooth or Cardiac Muscle Myosin—The CM-loop of DdMII extends from Arg397 to Gln407 (Fig. 1). We first tested the ability of the CM-loops of chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin II (residues 406–416) and human β-cardiac muscle myosin II (residues 403–413) to substitute for the DdMII CM-loop when the Wt and chimeric HCs were expressed in DdMII HC-null (HS1) cells. The Sm-loop differs from the Dd-loop at 5 of the 11 residues (Table I, A, blue); the Ca-loop differs at 8 positions from the Dd-loop (Table I, A, blue and green) and at 5 positions from the Sm-loop (Table I, A, green). We determined the cells doubling times and their abilities to cap ConA receptors and to develop beyond the mound stage when placed in starvation medium. We scored four stages of capping: panels 0–3 (Fig. 2A) and five stages of development: panels 0–4 (Fig. 2B); each stage was the endpoint for one or more of the mutant cell lines. The morphology of the mutants at their final developmental stage (Fig. 2B) was often abnormal and more variable compared with the parent AX3 cells at the corresponding stages (Fig. 2C). As determined by SDS-PAGE of cell lysates, all of the myosin constructs were expressed in equivalent amounts (Fig. 3A).Table IActivity of chimeras and point mutants of Dictyostelium myosin II CM-loop Residues in the Sm-loop and Ca-loop that differ from the Wt-loop are in blue; residues in the Ca-loop that differ from both the Sm-loop and Wt-loop are in green. Point mutants are underlined. Capping and development activity are reported as the average of 100 samples. To eliminate one possible source of variation, the same preparation of F-actin was used for all of the assays, which were completed within 3 days.a Did not double.b ATPase activity at 160 μm F-actin; activity too low to determine kcat and Kactin.

Null cells expressing Wt HC (Table I, A, Wt) grew at the same rate and to the same maximum cell density (not shown) as the parent AX3 cells, capped ConA receptors like AX3 cells, and developed fully to normal fruiting bodies, although complete development required 48 h rather than the 24 h required for AX3 cells. Null cells expressing the Sm-loop chimera (Table I, A, Sm) grew more slowly, and only to half the maximum density (not shown), than cells expressing Wt heavy chain, capped normally, and had partially impaired development. Cells expressing the Ca-loop chimera (Table I, A, Ca) were greatly impaired: growth, capping, and development were only slightly better than cells expressing Wt-Δ, which were similar to myosin II-null cells (Table I, A). The purified Wt myosin had the same actin-activated MgATPase (Table I, A) and in vitro motility activities as myosin purified from wild-type AX3 cells (not shown). The Sm-chimera had the same kcat, a somewhat higher Kactin and about half the in vitro motility activity of Wt myosin (Table I, A); the Ca-chimera had a much lower kcat, about the same Kactin, and one-third the in vitro motility activity of Wt (Table I, A). Although there were small variations in their basal (no F-actin) MgATPase activities (not shown), all of the constructs except Wt-Δ were substantially (20–200-fold) activated by F-actin. Wt-Δ was the only construct with no measurable in vitro motility activity (Table I, A). With these “base-line” values for the Wt and chimeric myosins, we made a series of point mutations in the Ca-loop to make its sequence more like the sequence of the Sm-loop, and in the Sm-loop to make its sequence more like the sequence of the Wt-loop. All of the point mutants were expressed in HS1 cells at equivalent levels to Wt DdMII (Fig. 3A), and all of the purified myosins were of high purity (Fig. 3, B and C). Point Mutations in the Ca-loop Chimera—Two of the five differences in sequence between the Ca-loop and Sm-loop (Table I, A, green) are conservative substitutions (Val for Ile at position 398 and Glu for Asp at position 403). Therefore, we focused on the three other positions, Asn402, Tyr404, and Thr406. Mutation Y404V (Table I, B, Ca-1) had no effect on the ability of the chimeric myosin to support growth, capping, or development; mutation N402R (Table I, B, Ca-2) slightly improved all three biological properties; and mutation T406Q (Table I, B, Ca-3) improved growth a little more than the N402R mutation. The double mutation Y404V and T406Q (Table I, B, Ca-4) supported capping activity better than either of the single mutations Ca-1 and Ca-3 alone but neither growth nor development was improved. Double mutation N402R and Y404V (Table I, B, Ca-5) substantially improved growth, capping, and development relative to the Ca-loop chimeras with the single mutations, Ca-2 and Ca-1. The triple mutation N402R, Y404V, and T406Q (Table I, B, Ca-6) further enhanced the ability of the Ca-chimera to support development. Although five of the six Ca-chimera mutants supported biological functions better than the parent Ca-chimera, the biochemical activities of all of the myosins were essentially the same (Table I, B); kcat and in vitro motility activities were similarly low, and Kactin values varied by no more than a factor of two. Notably, although the capping and development activities of Ca-6 were essentially identical to those of the Sm-chimera, Ca-6 had a much lower kcat and a lower Kactin than the Sm-chimera (Table I, B). Thus, the improved biological functions of the Ca-chimera mutants cannot be directly attributed to any single biochemical property. Point Mutations in the Sm-loop Chimera—Because one of the five differences (Table I, A, blue) between the Sm-loop and Wt-loop is conservative (Val for Leu at position 404), we focused on the four other differences. Sm-loop mutation K399L (Table I, C, Sm-1) had little, if any, effect on the ability of the Sm-chimera to support growth, capping, or development; this mutation lowered the kcat for actin-activated MgATPase activity but had no effect on Kactin or in vitro motility (Table I, C). Double mutation K399L and K407Q (Table I, C, Sm-2) was deleterious to growth and development and reduced kcat and Kactin but capping and in vitro motility were unaffected. Single mutation Q406A (Table I, C, Sm-3) also reduced growth but had little effect on capping and development and substantially lowered both kcat and Kactin with no effect on in vitro motility. On the other hand, double mutation K399L and V400A (Table I, C, Sm-4) improved growth and development, while capping remained at a high level, and lowered Kactin substantially but with little change in kcat and no change in in vitro motility. Quadruple mutation K399L, V400A, Q406A, and K407Q (Table I, C, Sm-5) had no additional effect on the biological functions or actin-activated MgATPase activity, but it was the only one of the Sm-loop constructs with in vitro motility activity as high as that of Wt. None of the three single point mutations that made the Sm-chimera sequence more similar to the Dd Wt-loop sequence (Sm-1, Sm-2, and Sm-3) improved biological function, and all decreased kcat. Only Sm-4 and Sm-5 supported biological activities better than the Sm-chimera and similar to Wt. These two constructs had kcat values similar to Sm and Wt and Kactin values less than Sm and equivalent to or less than the Kactin of Wt. Importance of Ala at Position 400—Because Sm-4 (with double mutation K399L and V400A) was biologically and biochemically as active as Sm-5 (which had two additional mutations), and much more active than Sm-1 (with single mutation K399L), Sm-loop mutation V400A seemed to be important. Therefore, we tested directly the apparent importance of Ala at position 400. The Sm-loop chimera with single mutation V400A (Table I, D, Sm-6) supported growth and development almost as well as Wt-myosin and retained the high capping activity of the Sm-chimera. Whereas this mutation did not increase in vitro motility activity, Kactin was substantially reduced, and kcat remained at the high level of the Sm-chimera (Table I, D). The effects of single mutation V400A on the properties of the Ca-chimera were even more pronounced. Despite the remaining seven differences in sequence, this single mutation (Table I, D, Ca-7) increased the ability of the Ca-chimera to support biological functions essentially to the level of Wt myosin and increased kcat (5-fold) and in vitro motility (3-fold) to the levels of Wt myosin, although Kactin doubled. The effects of the V400A mutation in the background of three other mutations in the Ca-chimera were similar (Table I, B and D, Ca-8 versus Ca-6). Conversely, the reverse mutation in the Wt-loop, A400V, dramatically inhibited Wt myosin's ability to support growth, capping, and development as well as reducing kcat and in vitro motility (Table I, D, Wt-1). In contrast, mutation of the adjacent residue in the Wt-loop, L399K, had no effect on any of the biological functions or in vitro activities of Wt myosin other than small increases in both kcat and Kactin (Table I, D, Wt-2). Effects of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Mutations at Position 407—The three mutations in the DdMII Wt-loop, R397Q, R397L, and R397W (Table I, E, Wt-3, Wt-4, and Wt-5), which corr"

A. 1975; 72: 1802-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, rate equations were derived to predict the regulatory effects of Na+ and lysine on the activity of HCS on the basis of the experimental data presented in the accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Rate equations were derived using the King-Altman algorithm method (7King E.L. Altman C. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1375-1381Crossref Scopus (737) Google Scholar) and the rapid equilibrium assumption of Cha (8Cha S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 820-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The simulated data correlate well within error with the experimental data and suggest that the activity of HCS in the presence of Na+ is simultaneously inhibited and activated. In the presence of lysine and Na+, the kinetic behavior of HCS is complex, and the Na+ effect is independent of lysine. Data Analysis and Simulation—The kinetic parameters used for simulation of kinetic behavior were obtained by fitting the experimental data presented in the accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using the appropriate rate equations and the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm supplied with the EnzFitter program from Biosoft (Cambridge, UK). All of the simulations were carried out using the appropriate derived equations and Mathematica Version 5.0.1.0 (Wolfram Research, Inc., Champaign, IL). Theory—On the basis of the experimental data presented in the accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a schematic of the regulatory kinetic mechanism of HCS by Na+ is shown in Scheme 1. The model is general in that it allows for binding of the effector to all enzyme forms. As described previously (9Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 421: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a conformational equilibrium exists for HCS in the absence of reactants. The activation, effected by the cations, can be explained by stabilizing the E (active) form of HCS. In the case of HCS, Scheme 1 is reduced to a consideration of the effector stabilizing only the E form, with no effect observed as reactants bind (see accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). The active form of the free enzyme is also subject to inhibition by the same effector that activates the enzyme. This phenomenon is separate from activation. In deriving the equation, all steps for binding of Na+ and the enzyme conformational change were assumed to be at equilibrium as shown in Scheme 1, and the mechanism is simplified as at the bottom of Scheme 1 (8Cha S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 820-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The simplified scheme was then used to derive the rate equation by the King-Altman method (7King E.L. Altman C. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1375-1381Crossref Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The fractions of productive enzyme, i.e. enzyme forms that go on to give product, at equilibrium within X are given as follows. Productive enzyme fractions are defined as fEAB=EABX and fEABact=ENaABX, where Equation 1 follows.X=E+ENa++E'+E'Na++EA+ENa+A+EB+E'B+ENa+B+E'Na+B+EAB+ENa+AB+Na+E+Na+ENa+(Eq. 1) Equilibrium dissociation constants can be written for each step and can be used to solve for the concentration of species in X in terms of effector concentration, the dissociation constant, and the concentration of E. Thus, ENa+ = E(Na+/Kact), E′ =E(Kconf), E′Na+ = E(Na+/Kact)-(Kconf′), EA = E(A/Kia), ENa+A = E(Na+/Kact)(A/Kia), EB = E(B/Kib), E′B = E(B/Kib)(Kconf), ENa+B = E(Na+/Kact)(B/Kib), E′Na+B = E(Na+/Kact)(B/Kib)(Kconf′), EAB = E(A/Kia)(B/Kb), ENa+AB = E(Na+/Kact)(A/Kia)(B/Kib), Na+E = E(Na+/Ki), and Na+ENa+ = E(Na+/Kact)(Na+/Ki) fEAB is given in Equation 2. fEAB=EABE+EA+ENa+A+EB+ENa+B+EAB+ENa+AB+E′+E′B+E′Na++E′Na+B+ENa++Na+ENa++Na+E(Eq. 2) Substitution of each of the enzyme forms in Equation 2 with the parameters defined above gives Equation 3. fEAB=ABKiaKb+(KbA+KiaKb(BKib)+AB)(1+Na+Kact)+KiaKb(1+BKib)(Kconf+Kconf′(Na+Kact))+KiaKb(1+Na+Kact)(Na+Ki)+KiaKb(Na+Kact)(Eq. 3) Equation 3 can be rearranged as shown in Equation 4. fEAB=ABKiaKb+((1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf′)(Na+Kact)+(1+Na+Kact)(Na+Ki))+Kia(KbKib)((1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf′)(Na+Kact))B+(KbA+AB)(1+Na+Kact)(Eq. 4) fEABact can be defined as shown in Equation 5.fEABact=fEABNa+Kact(Eq. 5) All of the other fractions (fJ) can be defined in the same way for Y and Z (Scheme 1). Therefore, the ENaPQ (where P and Q are CoA and homocitrate, respectively) to EPQ and ENaQ to EQ equilibria are included in Y and Z, respectively. However, as long as the affinity for the effector is independent of bound reactants, fEQ = fEPQ = 1/(1 + (Na+/Kact)) and fEQact=fEPQact=(Na+/Kact)/(1+(Na+/Kact)). The expression for Et (total enzyme) is equal to the sum of all enzyme forms (i.e. X, Y, and Z), and this gives the denominator of the final rate equation. X, Y, Z, and v (initial rate) can be defined as follows, where Δ is the sum of all of the numerator terms in X, Y, and Z (Equations 6, 7, 8, 9).XEt=(k9'fEPQact+k9fEPQ)×(k11'fEQact+k11fEQ)Δ=k9'Na+Kact+k9k11'Na+Kact+k11×11+Na+Kact2Δ(Eq. 6) YEt=(k5′fEABact+k5fEAB)×(k11′fEQact+k11fEQ)Δ=k5′Na+Kact+k5k11′Na+Kact+k11×11+Na+Kact(fEAB)Δ(Eq. 7) ZEi=(k5'fEABact+k5fEAB)×(k9'fEPQact+k9fEPQ)Δ=k5'Na+Kact+k5k9'Na+Kact+k9×11+Na+Kact(fEAB)Δ(Eq. 8) v=(k11′fEQact+k11fEQ)Z=(k5′fEABact+k5fEAB)(k9′fEPQact+k9fEPQ)×(k11′fEQact+k11fEQ)EtΔ=(k5′(Na+Kact)+k5)(k9′(Na+Kact)+k9)×(k11′(Na+Kact)+k11)(1(1+Na+Kact)2)(fEAB)EtΔ(Eq. 9) Substitution of the expression for Δ in Equation 9 givesEquation 10. v=(k5′(Na+Kact)+k5)(k9′(Na+Kact)+k9)(k11′(Na+Kact)+k11)Et(k9′(Na+Kact)+k9)(k11′(Na+Kact)+k11)fEAB+((k5′(Na+Kact)+k5)(k9′(Na+Kact)+k9)+(k5′(Na+Kact)+k5)(k11′(Na+Kact)+k11))×(1+Na+Kact)(Eq. 10) Substitution of the expression for fEAB into Equation 10 gives Equation 11. In Equation 11, if kj = kj′ (microscopic rate constants for binding and catalytic steps), as is true for Na+ activation of HCS, then the equation reduces to Equation 12 after rearrangement. v=[k5′(Na+Kact)+k5][k9′(Na+Kact)+k9][k11′(Na+Kact)+k11]ABEt[k9′(Na+Kact)+k9][k11′(Na+Kact)+k11][KiaKb[(1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf′)(Na+Kact)+(1+Na+Kact)(Na+Ki)]+Kia(KbKib)((1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf′)(Na+Kact))B+(KbA+AB)(1+Na+Kact)]+[[k5′(Na+Kact)+k5][k9′(Na+Kact)+k9]+[k5′(Na+Kact)+k5][k11′(Na+Kact)+k11]](1+Na+Kact)AB(Eq. 11) v=(k5k9k11)(1+Na+Kact)ABEtKiaKb(k9k11)((1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf′)(Na+Kact)+(1+Na+Kact)(Na+Ki))+Kia(KbKib)(k9k11)((1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf′)(Na+Kact))B+Kb(k9k11)(1+Na+Kact)A+(k5k9+k5k11+k9k11)AB(1+Na+Kact)(Eq. 12) The mechanism in the absence of Na+ is sequential ordered (10Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11790-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, expressions for kinetic parameters can be generated from Equation 12 at the limit where the Na+ concentration is zero, as shown in Equation 13.v=(k5k9k11)ABEtKiaKb(k9k11)(1+Kconf)+KiaKbKib(k9k11)(1+Kconf)B+Kb(k9k11)A+(k5k9+k5k11+k9k11)AB(Eq. 13) Dividing the numerator and denominator of Equation 13 by coefficient AB gives Equation 14.v=k5k9k11k5k9+k5k11+k9k11ABEtKiaKb(k9k11)k5k9+k5k11+k9k11(1+Kconf)+KiaKbKib(k9k11)k5k9+k5k11+k9k11(1+Kconf)B+Kb(k9k11)k5k9+k5k11+k9k11A+AB(Eq. 14) Thus, coefficient B/coefficient AB = Kia(Kb/Kib)(k9k11)/(k5k9 + k5k11 + k9k11) = Ka′ and coefficient A/coefficient AB = Kb(k9k11)/(k5k9 + k5k11 + k9k11) = Kb′, where Kb is the dissociation constant of AcCoA for EAB and Kia and Kib are the dissociation constants of A and B for EA and EB, respectively. The limit of Equation 14 where A and B tend to infinity gives V as (k5k9k11/(k5k9 + k5k11 + k9k11))Et, whereas the limit where A tends to infinity and B tends to zero gives (V/Kb′)B, the limit where B tends to infinity and A tends to zero gives ((V/Ka′)(1/(1 + Kconf)))A, and the limit when A and B tend to zero gives ((V/KiaKb′)(1/(1 + Kconf)))AB. Substituting the above kinetic parameters into Equations 14 and 12 gives Equations 15 and 16, respectively. (Equation 15 is basically equal to Equation 16 where the Na+ concentration is zero.)v=VABKiaKb'(1+Kconf)+Ka'(1+Kconf)B+Kb'A+AB(Eq. 15) v=V(1+Na+Kact)ABKiaKb′((1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf′)(Na+Kact)+(1+Na+Kact)(Na+Ki))+Ka′((1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf′)(Na+Kact))B+(Kb′A+AB)(1+Na+Kact)(Eq. 16) In Equation 16, for HCS, Kia, Ka′, and Kb′ are the dissociation constant for α-ketoglutarate (α-Kg) and the Michaelis constants for α-Kg and AcCoA, respectively; A and B represent the concentrations of α-Kg and AcCoA, respectively; Kact, Kconf′, and Ki reflect the activation constant for Na+, the conformational equilibrium between E and E′ in the presence of Na+, and the inhibition constant for Na+, respectively; Kconf is the equilibrium constant between E and E′ in the absence of Na+; and Na+ is the Na+ concentration.

The kinetic mechanism in this case is shown in Scheme 2. However, there is no experimental evidence to suggest that any lysine-bound E form of the enzyme can be formed (see accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). In this case, all of the enzyme species shown are assumed to be at equilibrium, and the rate of the enzyme reaction depicted in Scheme 2 is represented as v = kp((E + ENa+)/Et). kp is the overall enzymatic rate in the absence of inhibitors (not V because A and B are maintained at a fixed low concentration) and activators. Et is the sum of all enzyme species that are in equilibrium. The rate equation for prediction of enzyme behavior (derived as described above) in this case is as follows (Equation 17),v=kp1+Na+Kact1+Kconf1+1+Na+Kact''LysKiLys+(1+Kconf')Na+Kact+1+Na+KactNa+Ki(Eq. 17) where Kact″ is the activation constant of Na+ for the E′·Lys complex. When Na+ and Lys are at zero concentration, v is equal to kp/(1 + Kconf). The effect of Na+ on HCS activity is complex, with activation and inhibition occurring simultaneously depending on the concentration of Na+. As shown in the accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect is independent of its activation and results from combination at the active site, competing with AcCoA. Graphically, the effects of Na+ are observed in the tertiary replots of the initial rate data upon varying the concentrations of α-Kg, AcCoA, and Na+. The double-reciprocal plot of Equation 16 with the AcCoA concentration varied at fixed levels of α-Kg is given in Equation 18. 1v=(((KiaKb′V)((1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf′)(Na+Kact)...+...(1+Na+Kact)(Na+Ki))(1(1+Na+Kact)))1A+Kb′V)1B+((Ka′V)((1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf′)(Na+Kact))(1(1+Na+Kact)))1A+1V(Eq. 18) On the basis of Equation 18, expressions for the slope and intercept are given in Equations 19 and 20. Slope=KiaKb′V(1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf′)Na+Kact+1+Na+Kact×Na+Ki11+Na+Kact1A+Kb′V(Eq. 19) Intercept=Ka'V(1+Kconf)+(1+Kconf')Na+Kact×11+Na+Kact1A+1V(Eq. 20) If Kconf′ is equal to zero, as found experimentally for HCS, then on the basis of Equations 19 and 20, expressions for the slope of the slope (SOS) and the slope of the intercept (SOI) are given in Equations 21 and 22.SOS=KiaKb'V1+Kconf1+Na+Kact+Na+Ki(Eq. 21) SOI=Ka'V1+Kconf1+Na+Kact(Eq. 22) Tertiary replots are given by the slope of the secondary plot (slope versus 1/α-Kg) or the SOS versus Na+ concentration (Equation 21) and the intercept of the secondary plot (intercept versus 1/α-Kg) or the SOI versus Na+ concentration (Equation 22) and are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The SOS/SOI ratio is given by Equation 23 and is equal to the effective Ki for Na+ at the AcCoA site.SOS/SOI=KiaKb'Ka'1+1+Na+KactNa+Ki(1+Kconf)+Na+Kact(Eq. 23) As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the y intercepts (y1) represent the SOS and SOI at zero NaCl, respectively, given by y1-SOS = (KiaKb′/V)(1 + Kconf) and y1-SOI = (Ka′/V)(1 + Kconf).Fig. 2Tertiary replot of the SOI for the inhibition and activation by Na+. The values of x and y are defined under “Results and Discussion.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The point marked x2 in the SOS and SOI tertiary replots is equal to Kact, i.e. the concentration of Na+ that gives half-maximum activation in the absence of Na+ inhibition. In Fig. 1, y2 is the maximum activity for the enzyme in the absence of Na+ inhibition. The value of y2 is KiaKb′/V (obtained from the y intercept of Equation 21 when Na+ tends to infinity in the absence of Na+ inhibition). The value of y2 in the SOI plot is Ka′/V (Fig. 2), obtained from Equation 22 at infinite Na+. In both SOS and SOI plots, the y1/y2 ratio is 1 + Kconf (the fraction of activated enzyme). In Fig. 1, x3 is -Ki for Na+ inhibition for the fully activated enzyme. If Ki goes to infinity (high AcCoA), then the value of x1 (obtained using the derivative of Equation 21) in Fig. 1 (Equation 24) is comparable with the value of x1 in Fig. 2 (Equation 25), where x1 is an apparent Kact value that depends on the values of Kconf and Ki. In other words, it determines the intrinsic effects of Na+ inhibition and conformational changes on the Kact value. In the case of HCS, the effect is negligible. If Kact goes to infinity and Kconf goes to zero, then the value of Equation 24 is -Ki.x1-SOS=111+KconfKconfKact-1Ki(Eq. 24) x1-SOI=Kact1+1Kconf(Eq. 25) As Na+ goes to infinity in Equation 21, the equation will reduce to (KiaKb′/V)(1 + (Na+/Ki)), which is the equation for the dotted line that extrapolates to x3 as the SOS goes to zero. If there is no activation by Na+, Equation 21 is equal to (KiaKb′/V)((1 + Kconf) + (Na+/Ki)). In this case, the experimentally measured Ki is equal to Ki(1 + Kconf). Between the two extremes, no activation as a result of an infinite Kact and completely activated enzyme as a result of infinite Na+, a series of parallel lines is obtained for a plot of the SOS versus Na+ concentration at constant Ki. The y intercept depends on the value of Kconf. As the Ki for inhibition becomes greater than the Kact for activation by Na+, then the SOS plot (Fig. 1) will show a lower minimum value, indicating a greater observed activation, and the linear part of the curve will have a greater slope as Na+ is increased. Data simulation using the experimentally measured kinetic parameters (see accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) shows the dependence of activation on Kact. If the Kact for Na+ is much greater than the Ki (37 mm), then as described in Equation 21, the SOS versus Na+ concentration will approach linearity (Fig. 3A). If the Ki increases, the plot shows less and less inhibition (Fig. 3B). A three-dimensional plot of the above is shown in Fig. 3C. The SOI (Fig. 4) represents a measure of enzyme activity at high AcCoA and low α-Kg and exhibits no inhibition by Na+.In other words, an infinite concentration of AcCoA eliminates the Na+ inhibition by increasing its Ki to infinity. The percentage of HCS enzyme activity versus Na+ concentration based on the derived equations is in very good agreement with the experimental data (see accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)), indicating that the equations precisely predict the enzyme behavior of HCS at different Na+ concentrations (Fig. 5). Calculation of the percentage of HCS activity is derived by dividing Equation 16 by Equation 16 when the Na+ concentration is zero, with the assumption that Kconf′ = 0, and is shown in Equation 26.Fig. 5Percentage of HCS activity as a function of NaCl and substrate concentration. A, three-dimensional plot of the activity as a function of NaCl and α-Kg concentrations. B, three-dimensional plot of the activity as a function of NaCl and AcCoA concentrations. C, cross-sections of A at three different α-Kg concentrations as plotted. Increasing the α-Kg concentration eliminated both activation and inhibition at all Na+ concentrations.

Interestingly, the common point for all of the curves in Fig. 5C is 150 mm Na+, where the HCS activity remains at 100%, and this has physiological significance (see accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). In terms of Equation 26, increasing the level of substrate A gives 100% activity. However, increasing the AcCoA concentration (B goes to infinity) only eliminated the inhibitory effects of Na+, whereas it had no effect on the activation by Na+ (Fig. 5, B and D). The same mechanism can also be used to explain the behavior of other monovalent or divalent cations (see accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). The effects of lysine and Na+ in the absence and presence of AcCoA are complex (see accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). The equation predicting enzyme activity in this case is as follows, with the assumption that Kconf′ = 0 (see accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) (Equation 27),1v=Kconf1+Na+Kact''kpKiLys1+Na+KactLys+(1+Kconf)+Na+Kact+1+Na+KactNa+Kikp1+Na+Kact(Eq. 27) where Na+, Lys, Ki, and KiLys are the concentrations of Na+ and lysine and the inhibition constants for Na+ and lysine, respectively, and kp/(1 + Kconf) is the overall enzymatic rate in the absence of inhibitors and activators at fixed concentrations of α-Kg and AcCoA. The slope of the above equation when 1/v is plotted versus lysine concentration represents the enzyme activity as lysine tends to infinity. This equation can be used to explain HCS behavior in the presence of Na+ and lysine at both low and high AcCoA concentrations. However, the Ki and Kact values differ at high and low AcCoA concentrations. As shown in Fig. 6, the slope of Equation 27 versus Na+ concentration can be concave upward or downward depending on the values of Kact and Kact″. However, the values of Kact and Kact″ affect the slope in opposite directions, and concentrations higher than 150 mm Na+ (in the case of HCS) had almost no effect on the slope either at low or high AcCoA concentration. As mentioned above, this phenomenon is thought to have physiological significance (see accompanying article (11Andi B. West A.H. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31624-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). Fig. 7 shows the intercept of Equation 27, i.e. when the lysine concentration is zero. In this case, the equation reflects the kinetic behavior of the enzyme in the presence of Na+ as expected, and the intercept effect depends on the values of Kact and Ki. Increasing the Kact value eliminated the Na+ activation only and had little effect on the intercept values (low or high AcCoA concentration) (Fig. 7A). However, changing the Ki value dramatically changed the intercept (low and high AcCoA concentrations). Na+ inhibition was eliminated at higher Ki values, whereas activation remained.Fig. 7Predicted intercept for Na+/lysine activation/inhibition as a function of lysine at low and high AcCoA concentrations. A, plot of the intercept versus NaCl concentration (low AcCoA) at three different Kact values as plotted. Note that Kact had little effect on the slope of the graph. Increasing the Kact eliminated Na+ activation only. Ki was held constant at 25 mm. B, plot of the intercept versus NaCl concentration (low AcCoA) at three different Ki values as plotted. The slope was sensitive to slight changes in Ki. Kact was held constant at 25 mm. C, plot of the intercept versus NaCl concentration (high AcCoA) at three different Kact values as plotted. Again, Kact had little effect on the slope. Increasing the Kact eliminated Na+ activation only. Ki was held constant at 115 mm. D, plot of the intercept versus NaCl concentration (high AcCoA) at three different Ki values as plotted. As in B, the slope was sensitive to changes in Ki. Kact was held constant at 83 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In conclusion, the regulatory kinetic behavior of homocitrate synthase demonstrates the effect of a bifunctional activatory/inhibitory effector. In this context, the enzyme simultaneously senses the activatory and inhibitory effects of the effector, and the net catalytic outcome depends on the concentration of the effector and the activation and inhibition constants. The resulting expressions can be applied to enzyme systems that exhibit activation and inhibition as a result of interaction at different sites in the free enzyme."
