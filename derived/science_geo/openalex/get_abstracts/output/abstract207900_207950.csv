https://openalex.org/W1977389857,"A new approach to the important but difficult task of revealing possible human tumor viruses has been presented in this article. By systematic testing of already known human viruses for oncogenic properties, it was found that in hamsters injected intrapulmonarily with tissue culture fluid of human type 12 adenovirus within 24 hours after birth there was a very high incidence of malignant tumors at the site of injection in from 1 to 3 months. The tumorinducing activity was not lost by filtration through Selas 02 filters or by tissue culture passages in HeLa cells. Tumors thus induced grew in, and killed, a high percentage of the unconditioned young adult hamsters into which they were transplanted. No such tumors occurred in hamsters injected with control tissue culture fluid or with culture fluids of the other viruses tested, or in control breeder hamsters. The possibility that contamination with polyoma virus and simian virus 40 might be responsible for the tumors induced was specifically excluded by a variety of tests. The possible involvement of still other, as yet unknown, contaminant viruses was excluded by a positive association of the tumor-inducing ability with the adenovirus content. Of eight human sera tested, only those four which neutralized the adenovirus-type cytopathic effect also neutralized the tumor-inducing effect. Of 700 human sera tested, 26 percent contained CPE-neutralizing antibodies for type 12 adenovirus at titers of 1:4 and higher (23)."
https://openalex.org/W2059690211,Adrenal corticosterone production resulting from adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation in vitro depends upon the time of gland removal. This rhythm in adrenal reactivity to ACTH is out of phase with the corticosterone rhythm in serum of the mice used as donors of adrenals. The responsiveness of the gland to exogenous ACTH is highest when serum corticosterone levels are lowest.
https://openalex.org/W1973332112,"Split-brain monkeys (with forebrain divided) were trained to perform two contradictory visual tasks simultaneously, one task being presented to each eye. Usually one cerebral hemisphere dominated, but in some cases the two halves of the brain learned simultaneously. Contradictory color discriminations showed interference or transfer of learning until mid-brain commissures were also sectioned. The more extensive surgery failed to prevent transfer of simple brightness discriminations."

https://openalex.org/W2062451050,"The California pocket mouse, Perognathus californicus, compensates for food supplies which are less than the normal requirement by undergoing a variable period of daily torpor. At an ambient temperature of 15 degrees C, the body temperature of a torpid mouse drops to 16 degrees C, and the metabolism falls to 15 percent of the basal rate. Several other species of pocket mice also show this phenomenon."

The ionic strength of the serum and the concentrations of total solutes, calcium, urea, and other ions are below the levels found in marine elasmobranchs but higher than the levels in teleosts. The patterns of the calcium deposits of the vertebrae are identical in marine and fresh-water subspecies."

https://openalex.org/W2024179325,"IT has been shown by electron spin resonance that mechanical damage to biological material causes the formation of free radicals and changes of chemical valence. The change of hæmoglobin to methæmo-globin and the appearance of an unidentified free radical have been observed, and were due to mechanical damage of whole blood by freeze drying1. Mechanically excited electron spin resonance spectra of synthetic organic polymers were studied by Bresler et al.2."

https://openalex.org/W2094540581,"HYPOGLYCÆMIC activity of sulphonylureas is now well recognized. In a search for more effective compounds we have synthesized a large number of compounds closely related to tolbutamide. More than 80 compounds have been screened for their hypoglycæmic activity in animals. Out of these, six compounds have shown significant hypoglycæmic activity. Two of these compounds, N-benzenesulphonyl-N′-iso-propylurea (R–94) and N-benzenesulphonyl-N′-n-butylurea (R–131), have been found to possess a high degree of hypoglycæmic activity. The comparative study of the hypoglycæmic activity of these two compounds have been carried out on rabbits, rats and guinea pigs bred at this Institute and maintained on a uniform diet. They were fasted for 18–20 hr. before the drugs were administered orally as a suspension in gum acacia. Blood sugar was estimated by Somogyi's method using Nelson's reagent1,2."

https://openalex.org/W1968823305,"Alpha-methyl dihydroxyphenylalanine (alpha-MeDOPA) and alpha-methyl meta-tyrosine (alpha-MMT) do not lower significantly the convulsion thresholds to hexafluorodiethyl ether in the mouse, whereas reserpine and tetrabenazine produce marked lowering of these thresholds. Other workers have shown that alpha-MeDOPA and alpha-MMT decrease brain norepinephrine concentrations much more than brain 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations, while reserpine and tetrabenazine decrease the brain level of these two amines in a parallel fashion. Thus, the fact that alpha-MeDOPA and alpha-MMT, even in very large doses, do not lower convulsion thresholds and in some cases raise them suggests that the decline in 5-hydroxytryptamine may be implicated in the lowering of convulsion thresholds produced by reserpine and other, similar agents."
