https://openalex.org/W2038339955,"Fossil records clearly demonstrate that the group of trees known as Ginkgoales, of which today Ginkgo biloba is the sole living member, date back over 200 million years. Ginkgo bilboa itself is one of the oldest of living plants (4). It appears that the longevity of this tree and its long reproductive period are at least partially responsible for the persistence of the species. The resistance of these trees to pests such as insects, bacteria, viruses, and fungi has been studied. It is believed that their unusual resistance to pests accounts in part for the longevity of the trees and also, in turn, for the longevity of the species."
https://openalex.org/W1660781217,"Abstract An enzyme, 5'-nucleotidase, was purified from Escherichia coli. With the use of the osmotic shock technique, a 5000-fold purification was achieved with DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and repeat DEAE-cellulose chromatography. This enzyme hydrolyzes 5'-AMP, ATP, uridine diphosphate glucose and bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate. The ratios of specific activities remain constant for the various substrates throughout the purification, and the heat inactivation curves parallel each other. The purified 5'-nucleotidase of E. coli hydrolyzed all 5'-ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides with optimal activity against 5'-AMP. Substitution by a phosphoryl group as in pXp makes a compound resistant, as does substitution by another nucleotide as in pXpY. The enzyme is inactive against all sugar phosphates but will hydrolyze UDP-glucose. The 5'-AMP activity has a pH optimum of 6.0, the ATP activity 6.8, and UDP-glucose activity 7.4. The 5'-AMP activity is stimulated 100-fold by 5 x 10-3 m Co++ and 200-fold by the further addition of Ca++. The enzyme is inhibited by 0.1 m Zn++ and chelating agents. Only Mn++ is effective in replacing the Co++ stimulation of 5'-AMP or ATP hydrolysis, but Co++ is not needed for the UDP-glucose hydrolysis. The enzyme is minimally affected by its ionic environment, but it is highly labile to denaturation in the absence of bovine serum albumin. Phosphate is not inhibitory. The enzyme has been shown to be pure, as judged by molecular sieve chromatography, polyacrylamide disk gel electrophoresis, and ultracentrifugation. An s20,w value of 4.2 has been obtained. A molecular weight of 52,000 was found. The amino acid composition showed no unusual distribution."
https://openalex.org/W1489905936,"Abstract The concentration of magnesium ions in solution within Escherichia coli ML 35 was found to be the same as the extracellular concentration over a range of 10-6 m to 10-2 m. Since growth rate was unaffected at 4 x 10-5 m, it was concluded that protein synthesis in vivo is accomplished at much lower concentrations of magnesium than is required for protein synthesis in vitro. Ribosome-bound spermidine, but not putrescine, was found to vary inversely with ribosome-bound magnesium. It is proposed that polyamines, especially spermidine, may be more important for protein synthesis in vivo than is magnesium."
https://openalex.org/W2046284937,Hydrocephalus developed as a sequela of mumps virus infections of suckling hamsters. The initial infection after intracerebral inoculation was limited largely to ependymal cells lining the ventricles. This infection was clinically inapparent but later resulted in a noninflammatory stenosis or occlusion of the aqueduct of Sylvius.
https://openalex.org/W2053310148,"Electrophoretically distinct forms of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (TDH) have been detected in turtle, perch, trout, spinach, and yeast. Multiple forms were not detected in rat, rabbit, chicken, frog, honey bee, Euglena, or Escherichia coli. The combination of two different subunits into tetramers is a probable explanation for the five-membered sets usually detected in extracts exhibiting TDH multiplicity."
https://openalex.org/W2019789663,"The rise in brain temperature in the rabbit during paradoxical sleep originates in a temperature rise of the cerebral arterial blood. Heat loss from the ear is a major factor in the regulation of arterial blood temperature in the rabbit, and the primary thermal event in paradoxical sleep is a vasoconstriction of the skin of the ear which results in a rise in arterial blood and brain temperatures. These thermal correlates of paradoxical sleep are not present in a cold environment when the ear skin is already maximally vasoconstricted. The persistence of peripheral vasoconstriction during paradoxical sleep in a hot environment suggests a disturbance in autonomic thermoregulatory control."
https://openalex.org/W1575469852,"When highly purified cobamide-dependent ribonucleotide reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii is incubated with synthetically prepared 5, 6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide 5'-deoxyadenosyl coenzyme containing tritium attached to carbon atom 5' of the deoxyadenosyl moiety (DBCC-5'-3H), tritium is transferred from DBCC-5'-3H to H2O in a reaction requiring substrate, enzyme, and dithiol reductant. At low enzyme concentrations, the amount of tritium transferred to H2O is stoichiometrically equivalent to the amount of ribonucleotide reduced; hence, substrate-dependent release of tritium from DBCC-5'-3H is a sensitive assay for cobamide-dependent ribonucleotide reductase. When enzyme is incubated with unlabeled cobamide coenzyme in H2O-3H, tritium is transferred to coenzyme as well as to the 2'-deoxyribosyl carbon of the reaction product. The amount of tritium transferred from H2O-3H to product decreases with increasing concentration of unlabeled coenzyme. Coenzyme tritiated in the reductase reaction labels propionaldehyde in the dioldehydrase reaction. The results indicate that cobamide coenzyme functions as an essential hydrogen-transferring agent in the cobamide-dependent ribonucleotide reductase reaction, and that transferred hydrogen attaches to carbon atom 5' of the coenzyme deoxyadenosyl moiety. We conclude that although hydrogen is transferred intermolecularly in the reductase reaction and intramolecularly in the dioldehydrase reaction, the mechanism of coenzyme function is the same in both reactions."

They are not simple, homogeneous, gelatinous structures as heretofore described. Instead, each shows a definite and characteristic fibrillar design, which appears to be correlated with the known cytoarchitectural pattern of the underlying neuroepithelium."

https://openalex.org/W1545319403,"Abstract Escherichia coli 5'-nucleotidase has been shown to be a constitutive enzyme uninfluenced by the phosphate, sugar, or ionic content of the growth medium. It is a periplasmic located enzyme. 5'-Nucleotidase activities stimulated by Co++, with pH optima of 5.7 to 6.0, have been partially purified from Aerobacter aerogenes, Shigella sonnei, and Salmonella typhimurium. A specific protein inhibitor for the 5'-nucleotidase has been found in the cell cytoplasm. It inhibits the 5'-AMP, ATP, and uridine diphosphate glucose activity of the 5'-nucleotidase of E. coli and also inhibits the 5'-AMP hydrolysis of 5'-nucleotidases of A. aerogenes, S. sonnei, and S. typhimurium. The inhibitor is heat-labile at 45°. It combines with the 5'-nucleotidase at 0° as well as at 21°. Inhibitory activity is altered only by urea and is not affected by mercaptoethanol or metals."
https://openalex.org/W2041495974,"In attempting to define the role of ribosomes in the mechanism of streptomycin dependence, a new phenomenon has been discovered. Analysis of this phenomenon—called phenotypic masking—leads to the conclusion that ""streptomycin dependent"" mutants are actually ""drug dependent"" because their dependence is equally satisfied by several drugs. These drugs, some of which are totally unrelated chemically, act on the ribosome and induce misreading in vitro and suppression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1498315508,"Abstract The ability of proflavine to directly inhibit protein synthesis has led to an investigation of complex formation between the drug and ribonucleic acid. Evidence has been obtained from absorption and fluorescence spectra, as well as heat denaturation curves, that proflavine forms a complex with transfer ribonucleic acid which is qualitatively similar to the deoxyribonucleic acid-proflavine complex. Additional studies with polyadenylate, polyuridylate, and polycytidylate emphasize the importance of nucleic acid secondary structure, the ionic environment, and the molar ratio of nucleotide to proflavine in determining the type of drug-nucleic acid complex which will be formed."

https://openalex.org/W97612341,"Cells producing antibody were detected by a modified Jerne plaque technique. Of plaques initially containing a single central cell, 2.6 percent (45/1742) later had two. Mitosis of cells producing antibody was directly observed, with a mitotic time of not less than 40 minutes for the one mitosis timed at 37°C."

https://openalex.org/W2419610638,"In order to elucidate the chemical basis of interaction between regulatory enzymes and effectors, various structural analogues of adenosine 5'-monophosphate were investigated for the activating effect on the biodegradative threonine deaminase of Escherichia coli. The mode of activation by each compound was analyzed kinetically in terms of the maximal activation effect and the concentration which gave a half-maximal activation. The results with 38 compounds indicated that the base part of AMP was relatively nonspecific with regard to the maximal activation effect, but played a significant role in the binding; especially substitutions at the 6-amino group appeared to decrease the affinity. The ribose moiety contributed both to the binding and activation; especially the presence of a hydroxyl group at position 2‘ was important. The monophosphate group at position 5‘ was required both for the activation and binding."

https://openalex.org/W15632833,"Escherichia coli J-5, a uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimeraseless mutant of Escherichia coli 0111-B4, produces a cell wall lipopolysaccharide which lacks galactose and colitose (3,6-dideoxy- l -xylohexose) and contains reduced quantities of glucose and N-acetylglucosamine. With the use of a particulate fraction of the cell envelope of this mutant (which contains glycosyl transferases and lipopolysaccharide acceptor), the transfer of galactose, glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and colitose to the incomplete lipopolysaccharide was demonstrated. The addition of the various sugars to the acceptor apparently occurred in a sequential manner as indicated by the following observations: (a) galactose was transferred directly to the polymer from uridine diphosphate galactose; (b) transfer of glucose (from uridine diphosphate glucose) occurred only in the presence of uridine diphosphate galactose; the product of these reactions was released from the lipopolysaccharide by hydrolysis and shown to be a newly synthesized glucosylgalactose disaccharide; (c) in a similar manner, N-acetylglucosamine transfer from uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine to the polymer required the prior transfer of both galactose and glucose; (d) colitose was transferred (from guanosine diphosphate colitose) to the polymer in small, but reproducible, amounts only when the nucleotide derivatives of galactose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine were included in the incubation mixture; and (e) no evidence was obtained for the formation of oligosaccharide intermediate in any of the transferase systems studied. It is suggested that the transfer of galactose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine to the mutant polymer pertains to the biosynthesis of a “core” polysaccharide that has a structure similar to that observed in Salmonella. In addition, small amounts of colitose were incorporated into lipopolysaccharide when GDP-colitose-14C was incubated with the particulate enzyme preparation in the presence of UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine."

The 40S ribonucleoprotein prepared by exposing the 50S ribosomal subunit to a concentrated lithium chloride solution may also be deficient in the same protein components."

I feel that this may represent the identification of infectious agent antigen. Evidence is also presented for the possible existence of two different strains of the agent of infectious mononucleosis.

https://openalex.org/W2092859230,"THE receptors of bacterial cells for colicines have not so far been studied in great detail, but there is some evidence1,2 for the assumption that the role of these receptors is to fix colicines specifically on to the bacterial surface and to enable them to have inhibitive effects like phage receptors3. Although it is generally accepted, this hypothesis has never been proved4. The main support for it came from Fredericq's later experiments, which showed a cross-resistance between certain colicines and phages. Consequently they are both supposed to be adsorbed on to common receptors. Thus colicine K should share a common receptor with the phage T6 (ref. 5), colicine M with the phages T1 and T5 (ref. 6), etc."
https://openalex.org/W2006250871,"DIAZEPAM (‘Valium’, Roche) is a recently introduced anti-anxiety drug of the 1,4-benzodiazepine series1,2. Clinically, it is usually said to act for 6–8 h, but quantitative data about the time course of functional changes in man do not appear to be available. Measurements of changes in the visual critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT) and its auditory equivalent, the auditory flutter fusion threshold (AFFT), have been used for this purpose and the results are reported below. The fusion thresholds measure the ability of subjects to discriminate between rapidly repeated sensory stimuli, and both have been shown to be sensitive to the effects of small doses of centrally acting drugs3–6, which may impair or improve this discrimination."

The 5'-end of these triplets is toward the operator end of the operon. A hypothesis is presented to explain the fact that the frequency of recombination between adjacent nucleotides is many times lower than expected."

https://openalex.org/W2083632103,"THE ratio of the concentration of urea in the sweat to that in the plasma (s/p) is known to be greater than unity. Schwartz1 attributed this gradient to back diffusion of water because he found that raising the plasma urea concentration had little effect on the s/p ratio for urea. Recent evidence2,3 suggests that (a) s/p for urea is not entirely independent of plasma urea concentration; (b) s/p for urea is independent of s/p osmolality in man and the cat (for example, the s/p urea is greater than 1 in the hyperosmotic sweat obtained from the hairless footpad of the cat); (c) compounds related to urea by virtue of similar volumes of distribution (ethanol, antipyrine, creatinine) or similar molecular configuration (thiourea, methylurea, acetamide) all behave differently from urea in sweat in that none of these compounds is present in sweat at higher concentrations than in plasma."

https://openalex.org/W1993925245,ON the basis of electron microscope investigations of the human hair follicle Birbeck and Mercer1 suggested that pigment granules enter the cortical cells by phagocytosis. Swift2 gave support to this suggestion by illustrating the close association between pigment granules and cortical cell membranes in human hair. During recent investigations on a range of less common animal hairs we have obtained much additional evidence in support of the view that phagocytosis is responsible for the ingestation of pigment granules into cortical cells.
