https://openalex.org/W2036638802,"Conventional lasers (from table-top systems to microscopic devices) typically operate in the so-called weak-coupling regime, involving large numbers of atoms and photons; individual quanta have a negligible impact on the system dynamics. However, this is no longer the case when the system approaches the regime of strong coupling for which the number of atoms and photons can become quite small. Indeed, the lasing properties of a single atom in a resonant cavity have been extensively investigated theoretically1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Here we report the experimental realization of a one-atom laser operated in the regime of strong coupling. We exploit recent advances12 in cavity quantum electrodynamics that allow one atom to be isolated in an optical cavity in a regime for which one photon is sufficient to saturate the atomic transition. The observed characteristics of the atom–cavity system are qualitatively different from those of the familiar many-atom case. Specifically, our measurements of the intracavity photon number versus pump intensity indicate that there is no threshold for lasing, and we infer that the output flux from the cavity mode exceeds that from atomic fluorescence by more than tenfold. Observations of the second-order intensity correlation function demonstrate that our one-atom laser generates manifestly quantum (nonclassical) light, typified by photon anti-bunching and sub-poissonian photon statistics."

These microfossils are abundant and widely distributed in sediments, and the earliest generally accepted reports are from rocks of mid-Ordovician age (Llanvirn, 475 million years ago). Although distribution, morphology and ultrastructure of the spores indicate that they are derived from terrestrial plants, possibly early relatives of the bryophytes, this interpretation remains controversial as there is little in the way of direct evidence for the parent plants. An additional complicating factor is that there is a significant hiatus between the appearance of the first dispersed spores and fossils of relatively complete land plants (megafossils): spores predate the earliest megafossils (Late Silurian, 425 million year ago) by some 50 million years. Here we report the description of spore-containing plant fragments from Ordovician rocks of Oman. These fossils provide direct evidence for the nature of the spore-producing plants. They confirm that the earliest spores developed in large numbers within sporangia, providing strong evidence that they are the fossilized remains of bona fide land plants. Furthermore, analysis of spore wall ultrastructure supports liverwort affinities."

https://openalex.org/W2094619972,"c-Myc is helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (HLH-ZIP) oncoprotein that is frequently deregulated in human cancers. In order to bind DNA, regulate target gene expression, and function in a biological context, c-Myc must dimerize with another HLH-ZIP protein, Max. A large number of c-Myc target genes have been identified, and many of the encoded proteins are transforming. Such functional redundancy, however, complicates therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting any single target gene product. Given this consideration, we have instead attempted to identify ways by which c-Myc itself could be effectively disabled. We have used a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify low-molecular-weight compounds that inhibit c-Myc-Max association. All of the compounds prevented transactivation by c-Myc-Max heterodimers, inhibited cell cycle progression, and prevented the in vitro growth of fibroblasts in a c-Myc-dependent manner. Several of the compounds also inhibited tumor growth in vivo. These results show that the yeast two-hybrid screen is useful for identifying compounds that can be exploited in mammalian cells. More specifically, they provide a means by which structural analogs, based upon these first-generation Myc-Max inhibitors, can be developed to enhance antitumor efficacy."

https://openalex.org/W2153692118,"Quantum criticality is associated with a system composed of a nearly infinite number of interacting quantum degrees of freedom at zero temperature, and it implies that the system looks on average the same regardless of the time- and length scale on which it is observed. Electrons on the atomic scale do not exhibit such symmetry, which can only be generated as a collective phenomenon through the interactions between a large number of electrons. In materials with strong electron correlations a quantum phase transition at zero temperature can occur, and a quantum critical state has been predicted, which manifests itself through universal power-law behaviours of the response functions. Candidates have been found both in heavy-fermion systems and in the high-transition temperature (high-T(c)) copper oxide superconductors, but the reality and the physical nature of such a phase transition are still debated. Here we report a universal behaviour that is characteristic of the quantum critical region. We demonstrate that the experimentally measured phase angle agrees precisely with the exponent of the optical conductivity. This points towards a quantum phase transition of an unconventional kind in the high-T(c) superconductors."

https://openalex.org/W2094989728,"Granular matter does not flow homogeneously like a fluid when submitted to external stress, but usually forms rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear bands where the material yields and flows1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 (examples include geological faults9,10,11, avalanches12 and silo discharges2,13). Shear bands are narrow (five to ten grains in diameter1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13) and dependent on the particle shape5, and often localize near a boundary4,5,6,7,8,12,13; they hinder mixing and make grain flows difficult to predict or describe1,2,3. Here we show that the shear zones created in the bulk of the material are wider than those near the walls, and that their bulk velocity profiles lie on a universal curve. This finding challenges the accepted picture of shear banding in granular media."
https://openalex.org/W1981284245,"The most massive galaxies in the present-day Universe are found to lie in the centres of rich clusters. They have old, coeval stellar populations suggesting that the bulk of their stars must have formed at early epochs in spectacular starbursts1, which should be luminous phenomena when observed at submillimetre wavelengths2. The most popular model of galaxy formation predicts that these galaxies form in proto-clusters at high-density peaks in the early Universe3. Such peaks are indicated by massive high-redshift radio galaxies4. Here we report deep submillimetre mapping of seven high-redshift radio galaxies and their environments. These data confirm not only the presence of spatially extended regions of massive star-formation activity in the radio galaxies themselves, but also in companion objects previously undetected at any wavelength. The prevalence, orientation, and inferred masses of these submillimetre companion galaxies suggest that we are witnessing the synchronous formation of the most luminous elliptical galaxies found today at the centres of rich clusters of galaxies."

https://openalex.org/W1986368729,"Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with multiple mutations in mitochondrial DNA, both deletions and point mutations, and mutations in the nuclear gene for thymidine phosphorylase. Spinazzola et al. (Spinazzola, A., Marti, R., Nishino, I., Andreu, A., Naini, A., Tadesse, S., Pela, I., Zammarchi, E., Donati, M., Oliver, J., and Hirano, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 4128–4133) showed that MNGIE patients have elevated circulating thymidine levels and they hypothesized that this generates imbalanced mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools, which in turn are responsible for mitochondrial (mt) DNA mutagenesis. We tested this hypothesis by culturing HeLa cells in medium supplemented with 50 μm thymidine. After 8-month growth, mtDNA in the thymidine-treated culture, but not the control, showed multiple deletions, as detected both by Southern blotting and by long extension polymerase chain reaction. After 4-h growth in thymidine-supplemented medium, we found the mitochondrial dTTP and dGTP pools to expand significantly, the dCTP pool to drop significantly, and the dATP pool to drop slightly. In whole-cell extracts, dTTP and dGTP pools also expanded, but somewhat less than in mitochondria. The dCTP pool shrank by about 50%, and the dATP pool was essentially unchanged. These results are discussed in terms of the recent report by Nishigaki et al. (Nishigaki, Y., Marti, R., Copeland, W. C., and Hirano, M. (2003) J. Clin. Invest. 111, 1913–1921) that most mitochondrial point mutations in MNGIE patients involve T → C transitions in sequences containing two As to the 5′ side of a T residue. Our finding of dTTP and dGTP elevations and dATP depletion in mitochondrial dNTP pools are consistent with a mutagenic mechanism involving T-G mispairing followed by a next-nucleotide effect involving T insertion opposite A. Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with multiple mutations in mitochondrial DNA, both deletions and point mutations, and mutations in the nuclear gene for thymidine phosphorylase.

Our finding of dTTP and dGTP elevations and dATP depletion in mitochondrial dNTP pools are consistent with a mutagenic mechanism involving T-G mispairing followed by a next-nucleotide effect involving T insertion opposite A. The human mitochondrial genome is a 16.6-kbp double-stranded circular DNA molecule that encodes 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, and 13 polypeptides, all of which are essential proteins of the respiratory chain enzyme complexes (1Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7684) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; dNTP, deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphate; dNDP, deoxyribonucleoside 5′-diphosphate; LX, long extension; MNGIE, mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy; TP, thymidine phosphorylase. which is usually present in 2–10 copies per mitochondrion and 103 to 104 copies per cell, comprises ∼1% of total cellular DNA (2Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 3Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 453-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Since mtDNA replication is continuous, even in post-mitotic cells (4Bogenhagen D. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1977; 11: 719-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), a constant supply of nucleotides and balanced nucleotide pools are required for replication and maintenance of the mitochondrial genome. It has been shown that dNTPs within mitochondria comprise a metabolically and physically distinct pool (5Bestwick R.K. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9305-9308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.L. Mathews C.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1976; 251: 2938-2944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it is not clear how dNTPs arise within mitochondria nor how mitochondrial dNTP pools are regulated. Evidence supports the existence of four different pathways by which dNTPs could arise within mitochondria. First, dNTPs could be synthesized in the cytosol and taken up by specific transport systems as the triphosphate (8Bridges E.G. Jiang Z. Cheng Y-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4620-4625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Second, cytosolic dNTPs could be dephosphorylated and then the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDPs) be taken up by the deoxynucleotide transporter (9Dolce V. Fiermonte G. Runswick M.J. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and converted to dNTPs within the mitochondrion. Third, ribonucleoside diphosphates could be taken up by the deoxynucleotide carrier (9Dolce V. Fiermonte G. Runswick M.J. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), then reduced within the mitochondrion by mitochondrial ribonucleotide reductase (10Young P. Leeds J.M. Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fourth, mitochondria could directly import deoxyribonucleosides, then phosphorylate them within the organelle by thymidine kinase 2 and deoxyguanosine kinase (11Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Wang J. Chattopadhyaya J. Eriksson S. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1999; 18: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is well established that dNTP pool imbalances are mutagenic to cells (13Kunz B.A. Kohalmi S.E. Kunkel T.A. Mathews C.K. McIntosh E.M. Reidy J.A. Mutat. Res. 1994; 318: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), with mutagenic mechanisms including both insertion errors and next-nucleotide effects (14Kunkel T.A. Alexander P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 160-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Goodman M.F. Fygenson D.K. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that dNTP imbalances can induce frameshift mutations as well (16Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4946-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has suggested that an imbalance of mitochondrial nucleotide pools plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE; Ref. 17Nishino I. Spinazzola A. Hirano M. Science. 1999; 283: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (18Kaukonen J. Juselius J. Tiranti V.

Genet. 2001; 28: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), and Amish microcephaly (20Rosenberg M.J. Agarwala R. Bouffard G. Davis J. Fiermonte G. Hilliard M.S. Koch T. Kalikin L.M. Makalowska I. Morton D.H. Petty E.M. Weber J.L. Palmieri F. Kelley R.I. Schaffer A.A. Biesecker L.G. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). So far, however, there are no published data reporting direct analysis of mitochondrial dNTP pools in any of these conditions. Our laboratory described direct measurement of mitochondrial dNTP pools as long ago as 1982 (6Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.L. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9300-9304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the measurements were laborious, and progress was slow. Recently we have modified our analytical procedures for dNTPs, allowing for reliable measurements of mitochondrial dNTPs from as few as 2 × 108 cultured cells. Using these modified techniques, we have explored, in HeLa cells, some of the predictions made from studies on one mitochondrial disorder, MNGIE. MNGIE is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with multiple deletions and depletion of mtDNA in skeletal muscle (21Hirano M. Silvestri G. Blake D.M. Lombes A. Minetti C. Bonilla E. Hays A.P. Lovelace R.E. Butler I. Bertorini T.E. Threlkeld A.B. Mitsumoto H. Salberg L. Rowland L.P. DiMauro S. Neurology. 1994; 44: 721-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as mtDNA point mutations (22Nishigaki Y. Marti R. Copeland W.C. Hirano M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the nuclear gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP; Ref. 17Nishino I. Spinazzola A. Hirano M. Science. 1999; 283: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). TP catalyzes phosphorolysis of thymidine to thymine and deoxyribose 1-phosphate. A deficiency of TP leads to increased circulating levels of thymidine (dThd; Ref. 23Spinazzola A. Marti R. Nishino I. Andreu A. Naini A. Tadesse S. Pela I. Zammarchi E. Donati M. Oliver J. Hirano M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4128-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and deoxyuridine (24Marti R. Nishigaki Y. Hirano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that increased levels of dThd in MNGIE cause mitochondrial nucleotide pool imbalances, which, in turn, lead to mtDNA abnormalities (17Nishino I. Spinazzola A. Hirano M. Science. 1999; 283: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 23Spinazzola A. Marti R. Nishino I. Andreu A. Naini A. Tadesse S. Pela I. Zammarchi E. Donati M. Oliver J. Hirano M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4128-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis by culturing HeLa cells in medium supplemented with 50 μm thymidine and observing the effects upon dNTP pools within mitochondria and upon the generation of mtDNA deletions. Cell Culture—HeLa S3 cells were routinely grown at 37 °C with 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), with or without 50 μm thymidine. When cultures became 80–90% confluent, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then collected after trypsin treatment. When needed for DNA extraction, 80% of those cells were pelleted, with the remaining cells being subcultured and the culture medium being changed every 3 days. Whole-cell dNTP Pool Extraction and Analysis—HeLa S3 cells were cultured as described above. For each analysis, the cells in two 100-mm plates were washed with 5 ml each of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Extraction was carried out with 3 ml per plate of ice-cold 60% methanol. Plates were incubated at –20 °C for 1 h, following which the fluid was recovered and each plate was washed with an additional 1 ml of 60% methanol. Following this, all suspensions and washes were pooled. The pooled suspension was heated for 3 min in a boiling water bath, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 17,000 × g. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and dried under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in sterile water and stored at –20 °C for later analysis. Analysis of the dNTP pools in each extract was based upon the method of Sherman and Fyfe (25Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 unit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (United States Biochemical), 0.25 μm oligonucleotide template, and 0.67 μm [3H]dATP (30 Ci/mmol; 1.0 μCi per assay; Amersham Biosciences) or [3H]dTTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Incubation was carried out for 60 min at 37 °C. Cell number per sample was determined by hemocytometer counting. Mitochondrial dNTP Pool Extraction and Analysis—To determine the effect of thymidine treatment on mitochondrial dNTP pools, HeLa S3 cells were grown in 150-mm tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Once the cultures had reached 70–80% confluence, thymidine was added to a final concentration of 50 μm. After a 4-h treatment, the medium was removed and mitochondria were prepared by a modification of the methods of Trounce et al. (26Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼2 × 108 HeLa S3 cells were harvested from eight 150-mm tissue culture dishes by trypsin treatment and washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml cold isolation buffer, consisting of 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free). Then 10% digitonin solution was added to the suspension to a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. After 5-min incubation on ice, the suspension was diluted by adding 20 ml of isolation buffer, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Then the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of isolation buffer and the cells were disrupted with a motor-driven glass-Teflon homogenizer until about 80% of the cells were broken. The mitochondrial fraction was isolated by differential centrifugation and subsequently washed twice and resuspended in 2 ml of isolation buffer. Immediately after that, most of the mitochondrial suspension was centrifuged to pellet mitochondria and the remaining suspension was saved for later mitochondrial protein determination. The mitochondrial pellet was immediately resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 60% methanol and incubated at –20 °C for 1 h. The remaining procedures were the same as described for the whole-cell dNTP pool extraction procedures. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Long Extension PCR—Total DNA from HeLa cell samples was isolated by using the Wizard® genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). LX-PCR was performed to amplify the whole mtDNA genome using expand long template PCR system (Roche Applied Science). Primers were forward primer (L 15148–15174) and reverse primer (H 14842–14816). The PCR protocol consisted of initial 2-min denaturation at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 10 min, and a final extension of 7 min at 68 °C in a thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel at 100 V for 45 min and stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. To exclude the possibility that the low molecular weight bands were due to PCR artifacts, a second LX-PCR was performed using nested primers (L strand: 15148–15174) and (H strand: 13980–13956). Southern Blot Analysis—Total DNA from HeLa cell samples was isolated as described above. Approximately 5 μg of total DNA was digested to completion with restriction enzyme PvuII (Invitrogen) and the fragments separated by electrophoresis through a 0.7% agarose gel. After electrophoresis the gel was blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences). Then, after 4-h prehybridization, the membrane was hybridized with a mtDNA probe, which was generated by PCR using primers corresponding to mtDNA positions 8900–8922 and 9422–9400 and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.62Google Scholar). The washed membrane was exposed to an x-ray film at –70 °C with an intensifying screen. Mitochondrial dNTP Extraction and Analysis—A large body of literature exists regarding control of cellular dNTP pool sizes and the effects of pool imbalance on mutagenesis. In contrast, little information is available concerning mitochondrial dNTP metabolism, due to the technical difficulty of measuring these much smaller pools. Recent evidence indicates that an imbalance of mitochondrial nucleotide pools may play important roles in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including MNGIE, autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and Amish microcephaly (17Nishino I. Spinazzola A. Hirano M. Science. 1999; 283: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 18Kaukonen J. Juselius J. Tiranti V. Kyttala A. Zeviani M. Comi G. Keranen S. Peltonen L.

To investigate relationships between mitochondrial nucleotide metabolism and pathogenesis, it became necessary to increase the sensitivity of existing methods for dNTP measurement. By increasing the specific radioactivity of dNTPs used in the DNA polymerase-based method for dNTP analysis by some 3-fold, and by adopting the modifications to this assay of Sherman and Fyfe (25Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we have increased the sensitivity of this method by nearly an order of magnitude. By adopting the methods of Trounce et al. (26Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have improved our yield of mitochondria with no loss in quality. With these improvements, we can determine as little as 0.05 pmol of dNTP in a cell or organelle extract. This means that we can prepare enough mitochondria for a complete dNTP assay from 2 × 108 cells. Our earlier study (6Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.L. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9300-9304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) required more than 109 cells for each analysis. Effects of Thymidine Treatment on dNTP Pools—Spinazzola et al. (23Spinazzola A. Marti R. Nishino I. Andreu A. Naini A. Tadesse S. Pela I. Zammarchi E. Donati M. Oliver J. Hirano M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4128-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) showed that MNGIE patients showed elevations in circulating thymidine levels, presumably a consequence of decreased thymidine catabolism resulting from the deficiency of thymidine phosphorylase. They speculated that thymidine could be salvaged to dTTP within mitochondria, generating a pool imbalance that could account for replication errors in the mitochondrial genome, leading both to deletions and point mutations. To test this hypothesis, we cultured HeLa cells in thymidine-supplemented medium and determined the effects, both upon dNTP pools, in short term experiments, and generation of mtDNA deletions, in a long term experiment. Thymidine supplementation was at 50 μm. Fig. 1 shows the results of dNTP analyses in whole-cell and mitochondrial extracts. We found the mitochondrial dNTP pools to become imbalanced as a result of a 4-h exposure to 50 μm thymidine but not dramatically more so than the pools in whole-cell extracts. In whole-cell extracts dTTP and dGTP pools expanded by 2.2- and 1.5-fold, respectively; the dATP pool was unchanged, and the dCTP pool decreased to half its normal value. By comparison, the mitochondrial dTTP and dGTP pools increased by 2.6- and 2.2-fold, respectively, while the mitochondrial dATP and dCTP pools decreased to 78 and 43%, respectively, of corresponding values in the untreated cells. Several significant findings emerge from this experiment. First, as noted above, thymidine treatment did not unbalance the dNTP pools substantially more in mitochondria than in whole cells. However, factors such as a lack of mismatch repair in mitochondria (29Marcelino L.A. Thilly W.G. Mutation Res. 1999; 434: 177-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Bogenhagen D.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1276-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) may render mitochondrial DNA replication more susceptible than nuclear DNA replication to modest dNTP asymmetries. Second, the composition of the mitochondrial pool is quite different from that of the much larger whole-cell pool. As we and others have observed repeatedly (31Zhang X. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8401-8404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Martomo S.A. Mathews C.K. Mutat. Res. 2002; 499: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), dGTP represents only 5–10% ot the total dNTP pool in whole-cell extracts of cultured eukaryotic cells. However, in HeLa cell mitochondria, dGTP is considerably more abundant than either dATP or dCTP and is nearly as abundant as dTTP. Third, the effect of thymidine upon the mitochondrial dNTP pools suggests that ribonucleotide reductase plays a significant role in regulating dNTP pool sizes in the organelle. dTTP acts as an allosteric activator of GDP reduction by ribonucleotide reductase and an inhibitor of CDP reduction (33Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In recent experiments 2S. Song and C. K. Mathews, unpublished results. we have detected in liver mitochondria a ribonucleotide reductase activity that is similar to the major cell ribonucleotide reductase in its response to allosteric effectors. The dGTP accumulation and dCTP depletion seen in mitochondria from thymidine-treated cells are consistent with a regulatory role for mitochondrial ribonucleotide reductase. Of greatest interest, however, is the fact that the pool changes that we observe can account for the mutation spectrum reported by Nishigaki et al. (22Nishigaki Y. Marti R. Copeland W.C. Hirano M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) in mitochondrial DNA from MNGIE patients. These authors reported that most mitochondrial point mutations in MNGIE patients involve T → C transitions in sequences containing at least two As to the 5′ side of a T residue. Our findings of dTTP and dGTP elevations and dATP depletion in mitochondrial dNTP pools are consistent with a mutagenic mechanism involving competition between dGTP and dATP for incorporation opposite template T, followed by a next-nucleotide effect, in which T from the expanded dTTP pool is incorporated opposite the two A residues on the 5′ side of the mispairing. Deletion Mutagenesis Caused by dNTP Imbalance—Mitochondrial gene mutations in MNGIE patients include both point mutations and deletions (21Hirano M. Silvestri G. Blake D.M. Lombes A. Minetti C. Bonilla E. Hays A.P. Lovelace R.E. Butler I. Bertorini T.E. Threlkeld A.B. Mitsumoto H. Salberg L. Rowland L.P. DiMauro S. Neurology. 1994; 44: 721-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nishigaki Y. Marti R. Copeland W.C. Hirano M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As noted earlier, there are other disease states in which abnormalities in deoxyribonucleotide metabolism are associated with the generation of deletions in mitochondrial DNA (18Kaukonen J. Juselius J. Tiranti V. Kyttala A. Zeviani M. Comi G. Keranen S. Peltonen L. Suomalainen A. Science. 2000; 289: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 19Spelbrink J.N. Li F.Y. Tiranti V. Nikali K. Yuan Q.P. Tariq M. Wanrooij S. Garrido N. Comi G. Morandi L. Santoro L. Toscano A. Fabrizi G.M. Somer H. Croxen R. Beeson D. Poulton J. Suomalainen A. Jacobs H.T. Zeviani M. Larsson C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Although large dNTP asymmetries are known to stimulate frameshift mutations in vitro (16Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4946-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), it is not immediately apparent how modest pool asymmetries, of the type seen in this study, could stimulate the formation of long deletions. Nevertheless, we carried out an experiment to determine whether mitochondrial deletions could, in fact, be generated by long term exposure to pool-imbalanced conditions. To do this we cultured HeLa cells for 8 months in medium supplemented with 50 μm thymidine or without thymidine supplement. We then analyzed mitochondrial DNA from both cultures. Using a LX-PCR method, as shown in Fig. 2, we observed multiple deletion-containing mtDNA molecules ranging in size from 1 to 3.3 kbp in cells grown in thymidine-supplemented medium but not in cells grown for the same period in the same medium but without thymidine supplement. To exclude the possibility that the low molecular weight bands were due to PCR artifacts, a second LX-PCR was performed using nested primers. In all cases analyzed we obtained a pattern consistent with that observed in the first PCR (data not shown). To further confirm that long term thymidine treatment induces mtDNA deletions, we analyzed mtDNA by Southern blotting with a mtDNA-specific probe. As shown in Fig. 3, we detected a deletion-containing mtDNA molecule about 3 kbp in size in cells grown in the thymidine-treated culture but not in the control culture. Although these data clearly show a relationship between unbalanced dNTP pools and the creation of mitochondrial DNA deletions, they do not shed light on possible mechanisms. Several models, including a slip-replication model (34Shoffner J.M. Lott M.T. Voljavec A.S. Soueidan S.A. Costigan D.A. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7952-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and an illegitimate elongation model (35Buroker N.E. Brown J.R. Gilbert T.A. O'Hara P.J. Beckenbach A.T. Thomas W.K. Smith M.J. Genetics. 1990; 124: 157-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been proposed. Both of these require movement of single-stranded mtDNA and have been described (36Hirano M. Marti R. Ferreiro-Barros C. Vila M. Tadesse S. Nishigaki Y. Nishino I. Vu T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) as compatible with the concept that dNTP pool imbalances can induce multiple deletions of mtDNA. In that study Hirano et al. (36Hirano M. Marti R. Ferreiro-Barros C. Vila M. Tadesse S. Nishigaki Y. Nishino I. Vu T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) proposed that in the presence of unbalanced nucleotide pools, relatively low levels of one particular dNTP may lead to stalling of mtDNA replication, with the stalled replication intermediate containing a single-stranded region that would be susceptible to migration and to inappropriate annealing, particularly at direct sequence repeats. The data of Fig. 1 show that dCTP after short term thymidine exposure represents only two percent of the total mitochondrial dNTP pool. It seems reasonable to suggest that long term exposure to such conditions could generate deletions as a result of replication fork stalling, as proposed by Hirano et al. (36Hirano M. Marti R. Ferreiro-Barros C. Vila M. Tadesse S. Nishigaki Y. Nishino I. Vu T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A prediction from this model is that long term culturing of cells under conditions that prevent dCTP depletion should not result in the generation of deletions. The significance of this study is 3-fold. First, by improvements in methods for mitochondrial dNTP extraction and analysis, we have shown that cell culture represents a suitable model for investigating mitochondrial diseases that involve abnormalities in nucleotide metabolism. Second, although it is well known that dNTP asymmetries stimulate mutagenesis, this may be the first study to relate specific pool changes to a mutagenic mechanism that can account for actual mutations seen in affected humans. Third, even though this study does not test specific mechanisms, it strengthens the predicted causal relationship between deoxyribonucleotide pool imbalance and deletion mutagenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2006450622,"Effects of the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 (LY) have been examined in relation to responses of human leukemia cells to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs). Coexposure of U937 cells for 24 h to marginally toxic concentrations of LY294002 (e.g., 30 microM) and sodium butyrate (SB; 1 mM) resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial damage (e.g., cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release, loss of DeltaPsi(m)), caspase activation, and apoptosis. Similar results were observed in Jurkat, HL-60, and K562 leukemic cells and with other HDIs (e.g., SAHA, MS-275). Exposure of cells to SB/LY was associated with Bcl-2 and Bid cleavage, XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation, and diminished CD11b expression. While LY blocked SB-mediated Akt activation, enforced expression of a constitutively active (myristolated) Akt failed to attenuate SB/LY-mediated lethality. Unexpectedly, treatment of cells with SB+/-LY resulted in a marked reduction in phosphorylation (activation) of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Moreover, enforced expression of a constitutively active MEK1 construct partially but significantly attenuated SB/LY-induced apoptosis. Lastly, cotreatment with LY blocked SB-mediated induction of p21(CIP1/WAF1); moreover, enforced expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) significantly reduced SB/LY-mediated apoptosis. Together, these findings indicate that LY promotes SB-mediated apoptosis through an AKT-independent process that involves MEK/MAP kinase inactivation and interference with p21(CIP1/WAF1) induction."

The conserved PXP motif in the S6 segment of Shaker channels has been proposed to contribute to the intracellular gating structure. To investigate the role of this motif in the destabilization of the α-helix, both prolines were replaced to promote an α-helix (alanine) or to allow a flexible configuration (glycine). These substitutions were nonfunctional or resulted in drastically altered channel gating, highlighting an important role of these prolines.

The human K+ channel hKv1.5 is a homologue of the Drosophila Shaker K+ channel (1.Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 513-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A functional channel is composed of four individual α-subunits, each containing six membrane-spanning segments (S1-S6) and a pore loop between S5 and S6. The latter contains the GYG motif that is typical for potassium-selective channels (2.Heginbotham L. Lu Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of KcsA, a two-transmembrane one-pore K+ selective channel, has greatly advanced the understanding of ion permeation through a channel pore (3.Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar), providing a detailed picture of the mechanism of potassium conduction (4.Morais-Cabral J.H. Zhou Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 5.Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). The recently obtained crystal structure of KvAP, a bacterial 6TM-1P voltage-gated K+ channel, showed that the ion permeation pathway formed by the S5 through S6 region in this class of channels is indeed quite similar to that of KcsA (6.Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). The opening and closing of the ion-conducting pore (the gating process) of voltage-gated channels is triggered by a change in the membrane potential, which causes the voltage sensor of each subunit to reorient (for a review, see Ref. 7.Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). This physical reorientation of the voltage sensors results in the opening or closing of the channel gate. Experimental results from various laboratories support the view that the voltage-sensing domain consists of the S2 through S4 region, with the positively charged S4 as the primary component (7.Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). However, in contrast with a previous hypothesis, the crystal structure of KvAP indicates that the voltage sensor is located at the channel's outer perimeter and adopts a “paddle” conformation. In contrast to our understanding of the voltage sensor, we know considerably less about the molecular nature of the channel gate, and its mechanism of opening and closing remains unclear. Most information has been obtained from the use of channel blockers or cysteine-modifying chemicals (8.Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 413-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 9.Choi K.L. Mossman C. Aube J. Yellen G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 10.Holmgren M. Smith P.L. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), but it remained unclear whether the gate governing access to these blockers and chemicals was also the gate for K+ ions. The effects of small blockers such as Cd2+ and Ag+ suggested that the activation gate of Shaker is located around valine 478 (Val514 in hKv1.5) in S6 (11.Liu Y. Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1997; 19: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 12.del Camino D. Yellen G. Neuron. 2001; 32: 649-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). An alanine, valine, and tryptophan substitution scan of the lower part of S6 identified both Val478 and Phe481 (Val514 and Phe517 in hKv1.5) as the residues that most likely occlude the channel pore in the closed state (13.Hackos D.H. Chang T.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment of the Kv family reveals a highly conserved proline-X-proline motif (PXP, where X represents a hydrophobic residue) in the lower part of S6 (Fig. 1). Within the Kv family, this motif is fully conserved in members that form functional channels in a homotetrameric configuration. Prolines tend to destabilize (kink) α-helices by the lack of a backbone hydrogen bond (normally formed by the amide nitrogen) and by steric constraints (14.Blaber M. Zhang X.J. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 260: 1637-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 15.MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 16.O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 250: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 17.von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structure of the lower part of S6 of eucaryotic Kv channels should be different from that of the bacterial KvAP channel (18.Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 601-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar); the highly conserved double proline motif may kink the S6 α-helices of eucaryotic Kv channels, resulting in a “bent S6” model as was proposed by del Camino et al. (19.del Camino D. Holmgren M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Nature. 2000; 403: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Since KvAP lacks this tandem proline motif (Fig. 1), its crystal structure does not resolve the structural consequences of a PXP motif and the possibility of a kink in Shaker-type α-subunits. The extrapolation of the predicted gating mechanism for KvAP, KcsA, and MthK to Shaker channels would suggest that glycine 466 in Shaker (Gly502 in hKv1.5) acts as a potential hinge or pivoting point (6.Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar, 20.Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

However, this residue is not conserved within the Kir family, and based on the recent crystal structure of KirBac1.1 (23.Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), it was proposed that Gly143 (the equivalent of Pro475 in Shaker) was the pivoting point for gating, whereas Gly134 (equivalent of Shaker Gly466) was more important for packing. This hypothesis is strengthened, since Gly466 is located four helical turns upstream of the site of the proposed bend and the residues Val478 and Phe481, which are considered to occlude the pore in the closed state. As a consequence, it is still unclear how Shaker-type channels gate and to what extent the conserved PXP motif (Pro473 and Pro475 in Shaker) contributes to this process. We substituted both proline residues by glycine or alanine residues and combined these mutations with a proline substitution scan of the lower part of S6 to investigate the conformational role of this tandem proline motif in channel gating. Molecular Biology—hKv1.5 was expressed using a pBK-CMV expression vector. Mutations were introduced in hKv1.5 with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After the PCR-based mutagenesis, a PstI-BamHI fragment containing the mutation was cut out of the PCR-amplified vector and ligated in hKv1.5/pBKCMV to replace the wild-type sequence. Double-stranded sequencing of the exchanged fragment and the adjacent sequence confirmed the presence of the desired modification and the absence of unwanted mutations. Plasmid DNA for mammalian expression was obtained by amplification in XL2 BlueScript cells (Stratagene). The plasmid DNA was isolated from the bacterial cells with the endotoxin-free Maxiprep kit (Qiagen), and the cDNA concentration was determined with UV absorption. Electrophysiology—Ltk- cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were transfected with 0.5-5 μg of cDNA for WT or mutant subunits, following the lipofection method using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). 8-24 h after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and used for analysis within 12 h. Current recordings were made with an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Experiments were done at room temperature (20-23 °C); current recordings were low pass-filtered and sampled at 2-10 kHz with a Digidata 1200A data acquisition system (Axon Instruments). Command voltages and data storage were controlled with pClamp7 software (Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes were pulled from 1.2-mm Starbore borosilicate glass (Radnoti, Monrovia, CA) with a P-2000 puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). After heat polishing, the resistance of the patch pipettes was <3 megaohms in the standard extracellular solution. The cells were perfused continuously with a bath solution containing 130 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.35 with NaOH. The pipettes were filled with intracellular solution containing 110 mm KCl, 5 mm K4BAPTA, 5 mm K2ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES and adjusted to pH 7.2 using KOH. Junction potentials were zeroed with the filled pipette in the bath solution. The remaining liquid junction potential was not corrected and was estimated to be 1.7 mV (24.Neher E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). After achieving a gigaohm seal, the whole cell configuration was obtained by suction. Capacitive transients were elicited by applying a -10-mV voltage step to determine the capacitive surface area, access, and input resistance. The access resistance varied from 3 to 9 megaohms without compensation and was below 3 megaohms after whole cell compensation. Experiments were excluded from analysis if the voltage errors originating from series resistance were greater than 5 mV. Data Analysis—The holding potential was -80 mV unless otherwise specified. The interpulse interval was at least 15 s but was increased up to 45 s for some mutants to prevent accumulation of slow inactivation. Details of voltage protocols (voltage range and step duration) were adjusted based upon the different biophysical properties of mutant channels. Time constants of activation and deactivation were determined by fitting the current recordings with a single or double exponential function. The necessity of a second exponential component was judged both by inspection of difference plots and by F-statistics. The voltage dependence of channel activation was fitted with a Boltzmann equation: y = 1/(1 + exp(-(E - V)/k)), in which k represents the slope factor, E is the applied voltage, and V is the voltage at which 50% of the channels are activated. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Detailed kinetic information of all functional mutants is provided in the Supplemental Material. Confocal Imaging—WT hKv1.5 and nonfunctional proline mutants were tagged with GFP 1The abbreviation used is: ! GFPgreen fluorescent protein. at their carboxyl termini. HEK293 cells in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids were cultivated on coverslips and transfected using the lipofection method, with 0.5 μg of channel DNA. Cycloheximide (7.5 μg/ml of medium) was added to the culture medium 18 h after transfection. Another 18 h later, confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss CLSM 510, equipped with an argon laser (excitation, 488 nm) for the visualization of GFP-labeled channels. green fluorescent protein. Molecular Models—Molecular models were based upon the known three-dimensional crystal structure of KcsA (3.Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar). Within this structure, specific residues were substituted by a proline using the publicly available program Swiss-Pdb Viewer (available on the World Wide Web at us.expasy.org/spdbv/text/download.htm). Using the Swiss-Pdb viewer, we also altered the torsion angles of the substituted residues, and the proline residues were given their typical ϕ-Ψ bond angles for an α-helical context. These KcsA-based models were subsequently viewed with the program RasMol version 2.5 (available on the World Wide Web at openrasmol.org/). The latter program was also used to display the molecular models in Fig. 7. It has been suggested previously that the prolines of the conserved PXP motif cause a kink in the lower part of S6, based on the specific conformation of a proline in an α-helix. This kink would be located near the narrow part of the putative intracellular activation gate (12.del Camino D. Yellen G. Neuron. 2001; 32: 649-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 13.Hackos D.H. Chang T.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19.del Camino D. Holmgren M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Nature. 2000; 403: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of these prolines in channel gating, we mutated both residues to alanine (to force an α-helical configuration) or to glycine, which tends to destabilize an α-helix and could adopt the proline configuration (14.Blaber M. Zhang X.J. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 260: 1637-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 16.O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 250: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). It was suggested that 1) the gate is located in the lower part of S6 and that 2) disruption of the S6 α-helix is essential for a functional gate. We hypothesized that if the proline motif destabilizes the S6 α-helix, the effects of the glycine substitutions would be milder compared with the α-helix-promoting alanine substitutions. Substitution of the second proline (at position 511 in hKv1.5) with an alanine or a glycine resulted in voltage-dependent K+ currents. The gating kinetics were moderately (P511G) and drastically (P511A) modified (Fig. 2). For the P511A mutation, the midpoint of activation was shifted by at least 100 mV, and the voltage sensitivity (slope factor) was decreased by a factor of 2 compared with WT hKv1.5 (Fig. 3A and Table I). The time constants of activation and deactivation were extremely slow, ∼300 times slower than WT (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the overall effects of a glycine at the same position (P511G) were milder than those of the alanine mutation (P511A). Compared with WT hKv1.5, the voltage dependence of activation of P511G was shifted by about 60 mV in the positive direction (Fig. 3A) with time constants that were only 10 times slower (Fig. 3B and Table I).Fig. 3Biophysical properties of WT hKv1.5 (triangles), P511G (open circles), and P511A (filled circles) mutants.A, voltage dependence of activation: “isochronal” Po values, derived from the tail currents in Fig. 2, were plotted as a function of the prepulse potential. Compared with WT hKv1.5, the activation curve of P511G and P511A was shifted toward positive voltages. Note that in contrast with WT and P511G, the activation of P511A did not reach full saturation. B, gating kinetics. Time constants derived from monoexponential fits of the raw current traces (Fig. 2) were plotted as a function of membrane potential. Both the activation and deactivation time constants of P511G were clearly slower than WT hKv1.5. This slowing was not only the consequence of the shifted voltage dependence of activation. For P511A, both activation and deactivation time constants were extremely slow (note the semilogarithmic axis).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IProline scan of the lower part of S6 In the left panel a schematic illustration of the residues relative to Pro509 with on top an α-helical wheel representation and below a side view of an α-helix (orientation indicated with an arrow). The proline residues Pro509 and Pro511 are located at positions 0 and +2. The residues upstream and downstream of Pro509 are represented by negative and positive numbering, respectively. The right panel shows the biophysical properties of the proline substitution mutants. A plus or minus sign in the current (I) column indicates a functional or nonfunctional channel, respectively, in the voltage range -130 to +130mV. The current amplitudes observed are indicated with +++, meaning >1 nA with 2 μg, or +, meaning <2 nA with 5 μg of cDNA. The midpoint of activation (V1/2) and slope factor (k) were obtained from a fit with a Boltzmann function. The time constants of activation (τ) were derived from a single or double exponential fit of the current activation at a potential 60 mV above the midpoint potential (V1/2 + 60 mV), unless stated otherwise (voltage represented in parentheses). ND, not determinable; for details, see Fig. 6. n, the number of cells analyzed. All functional channels displayed a proper K+ selectivity, since no changes in Erev (-80 mV with the solutions used) were observed. Open table in a new tab In contrast, substitution of the first proline by an alanine or glycine (P509A and P509G) was not tolerated, since no time-dependent current was observed within a voltage range of -130 to +130 mV, even with 5- or 10-s voltage steps. The double mutant P509A/P511A, which should result in an α-helical conformation of the lower part of S6, comparable with KvAP and KcsA, was nonfunctional too. Confocal imaging showed that the nonfunctional proline mutants were properly expressed at the plasma membrane as shown by the prominent GFP staining (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the PXP motif plays an essential role in gating and that there appears to be an absolute requirement for the presence of the first proline. This is consistent with previous suggestions of their role in a kinked S6 α-helix. If these proline residues disrupt the α-helical structure of S6 to create a specific conformation, we reasoned that the introduction of a proline on a position other than 509 or 511 might rescue the functionality of the P509A/G, P509A/P511A, or P511A/G mutations. To explore this possibility, we performed a proline-scanning mutagenesis in these different backgrounds (Table I). Rescue of P509G—Remarkably, the nonfunctional P509G channel was rescued by the introduction of a proline at positions -3, -2, and +3 (the numbering is given with respect to the position of the first proline of the native motif, which is indicated in boldface type (i.e. -2P in P509G corresponds to PXGXP; see also Table I). This indicates that quasinormal voltage-dependent gating is possible with proline residues at positions that differ from the evolutionarily conserved ones. The voltage-dependent kinetics of the rescue mutant -2P in P509G (i.e. PXGXP) were comparable with WT (Table I; detailed kinetic information of all mutations is available in the Supplemental Material). In all cases, a control mutation was created by inserting the specified proline in a WT subunit. In the case of -2P in P509G, a proline was inserted at position -2P in a WT subunit, thus creating PXPXP. The control mutation had biophysical properties that were similar to those of -2P in P509G. This similarity suggested that the configuration of the glycine 509 in a PXGXP motif mimics that of a proline in a PXPXP motif. The biophysical properties of the rescue mutant -3P in P509G (i.e. PXXGXP) were comparable with WT (Table I). The +3P rescue mutant (i.e.GXPP) had a voltage dependence of channel activation comparable with that of the +3P mutation in WT (i.e.PXPP) (Table I), but the kinetic properties were clearly different. The activation and deactivation time course was monoexponential in the control mutation (+3P in WT) but was composed of two components in the case of +3P in P509G. The difference between +3P in P509G and in WT suggested that, in contrast with a PXGXP motif mentioned earlier, the glycine 509 in a GXPP motif adopted a conformation different from that of the corresponding proline in PXPP. None of the other proline mutants (Table I) could rescue the P509G mutation, as judged by the lack of time-dependent K+ current within the voltage range of -130 to +130 mV. Taken together, these results indicated that the presence of proline residues was essential, but that prolines at positions -3, -2, and +3 relative to Pro509 were tolerated in addition to the evolutionarily conserved ones. Rescue of P509A and P509A/P511A—Introduction of a proline at position -2, -1, or +3 in the nonfunctional P509A and P509A/P511A mutant backgrounds resulted in subunits that displayed time-dependent currents (Table I). The kinetics of the -2P and -1P rescue mutants in the P509A mutation (i.e. PXAXP and PAXP) approximated the WT kinetics. The double mutant P509A/P511A was also rescued by the -2P and -1P mutations (i.e. PXAXA and PAXA) (Fig. 5, A and B, and Table I). However, the rescue mutations in P509A compared better with WT than these in P509A/P511A, possibly because the extra proline (Pro511) was still present in P509A. Remarkably, the -1P mutation did not rescue P509G and also conferred nonfunctionality to WT (Table I). The +3P mutation rescued both P509A and P509A/P511A (i.e.AXPP and AXAP) (Fig. 6A). However, in contrast to the -2P and -1P rescue mutations, the time course of activation was extremely slow (>100-fold slower than WT) and even displayed an inverse voltage dependence (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, 5-s voltage steps to +90 mV failed to activate the channels completely (Fig. 6A). Thus, the activation curves did not reach full saturation, and the midpoint potentials were at least positive to +50 mV with slope factors over 20 mV (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6Biophysical properties of +3P in P509A (open circles) and P509A/P511A (filled circles).A, activation determined with a voltage protocol as shown at the top. Currents obtained for +3P in P509A (middle panel) and +3P in P509A/P511A (lower panel) indicated that both proline mutations clearly rescued the nonfunctional alanine mutants. However, both rescue mutations resulted in channels with drastically altered gating kinetics (i.e. both mutants activated extremely slowly). B, voltage dependence of activation. The normalized tail current amplitudes (from A) were plotted as a function of the prepulse potential. The WT hKv1.5 activation curve is represented with a dotted line. Note that both the activation curves of +3P in P509A (AXPP) (n = 5) and P509A/P511A (AXAP) (n = 6) did not saturate, indicating that activation was not complete within this voltage range. C, gating kinetics. Time constants of activation, derived from monoexponential fits of the raw current traces, were plotted as a function of potential. Both mutants were extremely slow (note the semilogarithmic axis). Also, the voltage dependence was inversed as time constants became slower at more depolarized potentials.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, these results did show that the nonfunctional P509A/P511A channel (i.e. with an AXA motif instead of PXP) could be rescued by the introduction of a single proline at another position in the lower part of S6. Moreover, the introduction of a proline at position -2 or -1 (i.e. PXAXA and PAXA) was better tolerated than at +3 (i.e.AXAP) (i.e. biophysical properties of these mutants were much closer to WT). The latter effect was also observed in the P509A and P509G background. To explore the importance of the relative position of the two proline residues of the native motif, we inserted two prolines at nonevolutionarily conserved positions in an α-helical forcing environment (P509A/P511A). Both proline residues were positioned relative to each other as in WT but with the addition of three hydrophobic residues between them. The mutant -2P+3P in P509A/P511A resulted in the PXAXAP sequence and, surprisingly, yielded current with a voltage dependence similar to WT (Fig. 5C and Table I). However, the gating kinetics were drastically changed (i.e. the time course of channel activation was best described with two components ∼40 and 400 times slower than WT) (Table I). These results showed that the PXAXAP sequence (like -3P in P509G; i.e. PXXGXP) could rescue functionality. Rescue of P511G and P511A—The mutations P511A and P511G resulted in functional channels but with clearly altered gating kinetics (Fig. 2). Introduction of a proline at positions -2, -1, and +3 in P511A and P511G restored near WT kinetics and indicated that these mutations allowed a structure more favorable for normal channel gating. As such, these could be interpreted as rescue mutations (Table I, Fig. 5, D-F). Considering the markedly altered properties of P511A, the biophysical properties of the -2P mutation (i.e. PXPXA) compared remarkably well with WT (Fig. 5D and Table I). In P511G, the -2P mutation resulted in a negative shift (-35 mV) of the voltage dependence of activation compared with WT. These results indicate that the tandem proline motif can be shifted upward along the S6 α-helix by at least two residues (i.e. PXPXA) without loss of function. Remarkably, in this configuration, the position of the first proline of the motif is opposite to that in WT, when represented on an α-helical wheel (Table I). The biophysical properties of -1P in P511G were similar to WT channels. In P511A, the -1P mutation shifted the voltage dependence of activation with 80 mV in negative direction (back toward WT values) and accelerated the activation rate by a factor of 100 (Fig. 5E). These results showed that the introduction of a proline on position -1, producing a PPXG or a PPXA motif, resulted in an S6 structure that functionally resembled that of a WT channel (native PXP). In contrast, the introduction of this extra proline in a WT background, resulting in a PPXP motif, was not tolerated. The rescue observed with the +3P mutation in P511G and P511A (Fig. 5F) was somewhat peculiar, since the voltage dependence of activation was comparable with WT, but the kinetics were not. In P511A, the +3P substitution resulted in time constants that were remarkably faster than those of P511A but consisted of two components. Thus, the -2P and -1P mutation rescued the biophysical properties of P511A and P511G better than the partial rescue of +3P. The introduction of a proline at a position other than -2, -1, or +3 in the functional P511G and P511A mutant resulted in a nonfunctional channel. The PXP Motif Is Important in Channel Gating—The PXP motif is highly conserved in the Kv1-4 family, which suggests an important functional role. The structural repercussions of a proline residue in the context of an α-helix suggest at least a 20° bend in the axis of the α-helix. Consistent with this, cysteine accessibility studies suggested a “bent S6” model for Shaker-type channels (19.del Camino D. Holmgren M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Nature. 2000"
https://openalex.org/W1973365570,"N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR, fenretinide) is a potent chemopreventive agent whose effect has been suggested to involve apoptosis induction. 4-HPR induces a loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c before caspase activation. Inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) by transfection with Bcl-2 or the Cytomegalovirus UL37 gene product vMIA prevented caspase activation and cell death. In contrast to other retinoid derivatives, 4-HPR has no direct MMP-inducing effects when added to isolated mitochondria or when added to proteoliposomes containing the MMP-regulatory permeability transition pore complex (PTPC). Moreover, although reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction appears to be instrumental for 4-HPR-induced MMP and apoptosis, inhibition of the NF-κB or p53-mediated signal transduction pathways failed to modulate 4-HPR-induced apoptosis. 4-HPR was found to cause an antioxidant-inhibitable conformational change of both Bax and Bak, leading to the exposure of their N-termini and to the mitochondrial relocalization of Bax. Cells with a Bax−/− Bak−/− genotype were resistant against the 4-HPR-induced MMP, overproduction of ROS and cell death. Altogether, these data indicate that 4-HPR induces MMP through an ROS-mediated pathway that involves the obligatory contribution of the proapopotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and/or Bak."

In this study, we elucidated the intracellular signaling pathways through which β<sub>1</sub> integrins modulate Fas-mediated apoptosis in T lymphocytes. In experiments done in Jurkat T cells and activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes, engagement of α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin with collagen type I (Coll I) was found to significantly reduce Fas-induced apoptosis and caspase-8 activation; Annexin V binding and DNA fragmentation were reduced by ∼42 and 38%, respectively. We demonstrated that the protective action of Coll I does not require new protein synthesis but was dependent on the activation of the MAPK/Erk pathway. Furthermore, we found that activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by Coll I was required for both Coll I-mediated activation of Erk, and inhibition of Fas-induced caspase-8 activation and apoptosis. Other ligands of β<sub>1</sub> integrins, fibronectin (Fbn), and laminin (Lam), did not sustain significant Erk activation and had no effect on Fas-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence of a PP2A-dependent activation of the MAPK/Erk pathway downstream of α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin, which has a functional role in regulating Fas-mediated apoptosis in T lymphocytes. As such, this study emphasizes the potential importance that Coll I interactions may have on the control of T lymphocyte homeostasis and their persistence in chronic inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2068686330,"We have previously identified the tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1 (TSLC1) gene as a novel tumor suppressor in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by functional complementation. TSLC1 encodes a membrane glycoprotein belonging to an immunoglobulin superfamily and participates in cell adhesion. A truncating mutation of the TSLC1 corresponding to its cytoplasmic domain in a primary NSCLC tumor suggests that this domain is important for tumor suppressor activity. Here, we report that TSLC1 directly associates with MPP3, one of the human homologues of a Drosophila tumor suppressor gene, Discs large (Dlg). This interaction was dependent on the presence of a PDZ-binding motif at the carboxyl terminus of TSLC1. Furthermore, TSLC1 and MPP3 were colocalized at the cell–cell attachment sites in both a low and a high cell density. The MPP3 gene was expressed in normal lung as well as in many tissues examined except for peripheral blood lymphocytes but lost its expression in one of the nine NSCLC cell lines. These results suggest that TSLC1 and MPP3 are involved in the same cascade of cell–cell interaction, and that the disruption of this cascade might lead cells to malignant growth and tumor formation in lung cancer."

Rap1 is variably expressed in whole cell lysates of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines. Immunoblot analysis of nuclear and cytosolic fractions and immunohistochemistry revealed that in addition to cytoplasmic expression, SCC cells also exhibit prominent punctate rap1 expression in the nucleus. This unexpected nuclear distribution was confirmed by the evaluation of human oral cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry, which showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. Cytoplasmic rap1 expression was observed mostly in large differentiated cells, whereas nuclear localization was found in morphologically less differentiated cells. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis showed that both rap1A and rap1B are expressed in SCC cell lines although rap1B signals are more prominent. Transfection with enhanced GFP-tagged constitutively active and inactive forms of rap1B demonstrated that the active GTP-bound form translocates to the nucleus whereas inactive rap1BGDP is retained in the cytoplasm, much of which is in a perinuclear distribution. Furthermore, growth factors induce nuclear translocation of rap1 in oral cancer cells. This novel discovery that active, GTP-bound rap1 translocates to the nucleus makes it only the second of over 100 small GTP-binding proteins to be identified in the nucleus, and the striking prominence of rap1 expression in the nucleus of SCC cells suggests that activated rap1 plays a role in the malignant process."
https://openalex.org/W1963866409,"Cartilage glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis and composition, upon which its structural integrity depends, varies with age, is modified by anabolic and catabolic stimuli, and is regulated by UDP-glucuronate availability. However, how such stimuli, prototypically represented by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and IL-1α, modify GAG synthesis during aging of normal human articular cartilage is not known. Using explants, we show that chondroitin sulfate (CS):total GAG ratios decrease, whereas C6S:C4S ratios increase with cartilage maturation, and that chondrocytes in the cartilage mid-zone, but not the superficial or deep zones, exhibit uridine 5′-diphosphoglucose dehydrogenase (UDPGD) activity, which is also increased in mature cartilage. We also show that IL-1α treatment reduces both total GAG and CS synthesis, decreases C6S:C4S ratios (less C6S), but fails to modify chondrocyte UDPGD activity at all ages. On the other hand, TGF-β1 increases total GAG synthesis in immature, but not mature, cartilage (stimulates CS but not non-CS), age-independently decreases C6S:C4S (more C4S), and increases chondrocyte UDPGD activity in a manner inversely correlated with age. Our findings show that TGF-β1, but not IL-1α, modifies matrix synthesis such that its composition more closely resembles “less mature” articular cartilage. These effects of TGF-β1, which appear to be restricted to periods of skeletal immaturity, are closely associated although not necessarily mechanistically linked with increases in chondrocyte UDPGD activity.

Fosang A.J. J. Rheumatol. Suppl. 1995; 43: 86-90PubMed Google Scholar). The carbohydrate component of aggrecan, which constitutes at least 90% of its molecular mass, consists of many long, predominantly chondroitin sulfate (CS) and keratan sulfate (KS), unbranched glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains covalently linked to a core protein (2Nieduszynski I.A. Huckerby T.H. Brown G.M. Tai G.-H. Morris H.G. Eady S. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The contribution of these GAGs to PG function has been divided into two categories: firstly, maintenance of hydration, a property dependent on their polyanionicity, which engenders in cartilage the ability to withstand compression (3Comper W. Laurent T. Physiol. Rev. 1978; 58: 255-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), and secondly, interactions with other macromolecules, which depend on the specific distribution of GAG negative charges and their carbohydrate backbone conformation (4Muir H.M. Hardingham T.E. Scott J.T. Copeman's Textbook of the Rheumatic Diseases. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1986: 177-198Google Scholar).

It is however, well established that all these carbohydrate components are synthesized from UDP-sugar nucleotide precursors and assembled onto the core protein by a system of specific glycosyl transferases (5Roden L. Lennarz W.J. Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Google Scholar). The efficiency of this system depends on UDP sugar availability, and it has been proposed that one of the key regulatory points in this synthetic pathway is the utilization of UDP-glucose (UDPGlc) (6Handley C.J. Phelps C.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 417-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is pertinent that UDPGlc can be converted to either UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGlcUA) by UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDPGD; EC 1.1.1.22) activity or UDP-galactose by UDPGlc 4′-epimerase. UDPGlcUA is a precursor of GlcUA in the synthesis of CS disaccharides (with GalNAc) that culminates in C-4 or C-6 sulfation of the hexosamine by specific sulfotransferase enzymes to produce chondroitin-4 (GlcUA-β1,3 GalNAc 4S) or chondroitin-6 sulfate (GlcUA-β1,3 GalNAc 6S), respectively. On the other hand, the synthesis of the keratan sulfate (KS) chains, composed of galactose (Gal)-GlcNAc repeating disaccharide units, sulfated on the C-6 position of GlcNAc or Gal, appears to be constrained by the supply of UDP-galactose (7De Luca G. Castellani A.A. Acta Biol. Hung. 1984; 35: 109-121PubMed Google Scholar, 8Toma L. Pinhal M.A. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

De Luca G. Castellani A.A. Greiling H. Scott J.E. Keratan Sulfate: Chemistry, Biology and Chemical Pathology. Biochemistry Soceity, London1989: 53-65Google Scholar, 10Molz R.J. Danishefsky I.

Chem. 1989; 73: 25117-25124Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms regulating UDPGD activity in human articular cartilage remain ill defined. It is known that GAG composition can be altered through the modulation of such pathways and that this can have a major influence on the physicochemical property of the tissue (13Ysart G.E. Mason R.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 14Buschmann M.D. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biomech. Eng. 1995; 117: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, the control of UDP-sugar precursor availability may permit cells to direct their synthetic activity toward particular types of GAG chain. In addition, cellular regulation of GAG chain sulfation represents a further means by which PG content can be specifically modified to meet the requirements of the ECM (15Toyoda H. Kinohsita-Toyoda A. Fox B. Selleck S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21856-21861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Changes in cartilage GAG chain composition can result from chondrocyte activation and induction of anabolic or catabolic responses, and much evidence indicates that both cytokines and growth factors influence these responses (16Goldring M.B. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1916-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Indeed, members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), exhibit chondrogenic properties and stimulate PG synthesis by articular chondrocytes in vitro and in vivo. In addition, TGF-β1 can counteract the suppression of cartilage PG synthesis that is induced by the cytokine, interleukin-1α (IL-1α) (17Redini F. Mauviel A. Pronost S. Loyau G. Pujol J. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The influence of these cytokines and growth factors on sulfation patterns has been examined in several tissues (18Morales T.I. Hascall V.C. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 1197-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, few studies have evaluated such responses in normal human cartilage, and fewer still have addressed the possibility that they may be modulated by aging. A study of the modulation of GAG chain synthesis and sulfation patterns by TGF-β1 and IL-1α in normal human tissue is therefore highly relevant to place in perspective the changes in GAG structure that occur in diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). In the present study, we have examined age-related changes in GAG synthesis and composition, as well as changes induced in response to exogenous treatment with recombinant human (rh) TGF-β1 or rhIL-1α. To evaluate the contribution of individual chondrocytes to such changes in GAG synthesis, we have used quantitative cytochemistry to evaluate age-related and TGF-β1 or IL-1α-induced alterations in resident chondrocyte UDPGD activity in distinct regions of articular cartilage.

Tissue Culture—Human articular cartilage (macroscopically normal) was obtained within 6 h of surgery from weight-bearing regions of femoral condyles from patients undergoing amputation or joint replacement for osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma distant from the joint, and in all cases, joints were not involved in the tumor pathology. Full thickness cartilage slices were washed in DMEM containing 3.7 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 mg/ml d-glucose, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and modified Eagle's medium non-essential amino acids (100×) solution (Invitrogen). Medium was not supplemented with serum. For assessment of PG synthesis, cartilage was then diced into 1-2-mm3 pieces and randomized to account for variations in proteoglycan content in different regions across the surface of the condyle (19Hickery M.S. Bayliss M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1425: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assessment of PG Synthesis—Rates of proteoglycan synthesis were determined using 20-30 mg of cartilage placed in each well of a Linbro 24-well culture plate (2 cm2/well) containing 900 μl of DMEM and 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Explants were preincubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 48 h to attain a stable rate of proteoglycan metabolism; in all cases, segments were cultured for a 2-day “wash-out” period prior to experimental treatment to minimize the effects of medication and surgical isolation. 2M. S Hickery, M. T. Bayliss, J. Dudhia, J. C. Lewthwaite, J. C. W. Edwards, and A. A. Pitsillides, unpublished data. Explants were then labeled with 10 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate during the final 6 h of culture after incubation in control medium or medium supplemented with either 1.0 ng/ml rhIL-1α or 10.0 ng/ml rhTGF-β1 for 48 h (20Brocklehurst R. Bayliss M.T. Maroudas A. Coysh H.L. Freeman M.A. Revell P.A. Ali S.Y. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 1984; 66: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Subsequently, explants were digested in papain and 500-μl aliquots of 35S-labeled digest eluted from a 9.1-ml Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 2 m guanidinium chloride, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8. Radiolabel incorporated into the VO peak was determined by scintillation counting. In all experiments, media were refreshed daily, and those required for analysis were frozen and stored at -70 °C. Preliminary studies found that ∼85% of human articular cartilage samples exhibited no induction of GAG release from either endogenous or newly synthesized pools in response to IL-1α treatment and that this was not dependent on the age of the samples. It is therefore likely that the effects of IL-1α treatment are not the product of PG degradation. GAG chain structure was evaluated using 150-200 mg of cartilage cultured in 1800 μl of DMEM and 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 50 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate for 6 h. In parallel experiments, segments (at least triplicate) of each cartilage sample (0.5 mm3), with as much of the subchondral bone removed as possible, were cultured after appropriate preincubation (see above) in the presence and absence of 1 ng/ml rhIL-1α or 10 ng/ml rhTGF-β1 for 48 h. They were then immediately snap-chilled in n-hexane at -70 °C (grade low in aromatic hydrocarbons) and stored at -70 °C until cryostat sections were cut for assessment of UDPGD activity (see below). Sulfated Glycosaminoglycan Analysis—Distribution of [35S]sulfate-labeled CS/DS and residual chondroitinase ABC lyase-insensitive GAG pools was determined by eluting chondroitinase-digested material on a Sephadex G50 (145 × 0.6 cm) column, equilibrated with 0.05 m NaAc, pH 5.0, and calibrated by the methods of Wasteson (21Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). [35S]Sulfate incorporation into GAGs was determined by scintillation counting. Disaccharide Analysis—Chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfate patterns were determined by HPLC separation. Briefly, cartilage samples were digested with 250 μg/ml papain in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 2.4 mm EDTA, and 10 mml-cysteine, pH 5.8, at 65 °C for 24 h and then boiled for 15 min. Samples were dialyzed into 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and concentrated in a Centricon ultrafiltration device containing a Mr 10,000 exclusion membrane (spun at 4600 × g for 45 min). After digestion with 0.2 units of chondroitinase ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4) at 37 °C overnight, samples were removed, ethanol-precipitated (4× volume), and stored overnight at 4 °C. After removal of a small pellet containing undigested material and residual enzyme, the supernatant was eluted from a partisil 5-PAC column equilibrated in Tris borate buffer (22Zebrower M. Kieras F.J. Heaney-Kieras J. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Maroudas A. Freeman M.A.R Adult Articular Cartilage. Pitman, Turnbridge Wells, London1979: 215-290Google Scholar). Monitoring UV absorbance at 232 nm enabled the ΔDi-6SO4:ΔDi-4SO4 (C6S:C4S) ratio in the endogenous proteoglycan pool to be determined. Newly synthesized ratios were determined by incorporation of [35S]sulfate into ΔDi-6SO4:ΔDi-4SO4. Measurement of UDPGD Activity—UDPGD activity was assessed in fresh, unfixed cryostat sections of snap-frozen segments of “fresh” and “cultured” human articular cartilage using the method of Mehdizadeh et al. (24Mehdizadeh S. Bitensky L. Chayen J. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1991; 9: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were incubated at 37 °C, in an atmosphere of nitrogen, in medium containing 5.3 mm UDP-glucose, 0.45 mm NAD in 30% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (grade GO4/140) in 0.05 m glycylglycine buffer, pH 7.8. Just prior to use, the medium was saturated with nitrogen, pH was adjusted to pH 7.8, and 3.7 mm nitroblue tetrazolium added; in all instances, the reaction time was 30 min. To check reaction specificity, activity in serial sections incubated in medium lacking substrate (no UDP-glucose) or in full medium including 0.2 mm UDP-xylose (inhibitor of UDPGD activity) was also assessed. After the reaction, sections were washed in water, dried, and mounted in Aquamount. Using these methods, UDPGD activity results in the reduction of the soluble tetrazolium salt to produce a colored, insoluble formazan salt precipitate at sites of activity. The optical density of this product is stoichiometrically related to enzyme activity, which is retained in the tissue sections by use of the colloidal tissue stabilizer, polyvinyl alcohol (25Altmann F.P. Chayen J. Nature. 1965; 207: 1205-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The amount of precipitated formazan in individual chondrocytes (in histologically defined zones of cartilage; Fig. 1, Zones 1-4) was measured with a Vickers M85A scanning and integrating microdensitometer, at a wavelength of 560 nm with a ×40 objective and a scanning spot of 0.5 μm in the plane of the section (26Chayen J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1984; 12: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Pitsillides A.A. Blake S.M. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1992; 51: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At least 10 cells were measured in each zone, in at least duplicate sections from each explant, and at least two explants were examined to assess each cartilage sample. In all cases, measurements were made in sections reacted in full medium as well as in serial sections incubated in medium lacking substrate. Results were converted into units of mean integrated extinction × 100/30 min, and all the results are expressed as substrate-specific UDPGD activity. Statistics—All results are reported as mean ± S.E. Comparisons were evaluated by Wilkoxen's signed-rank test, by paired or unpaired Student's t test on original numerical data (as appropriate) and not the percentage figures illustrated. In all cases, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Changes Associated with Cartilage Aging—To establish age-related changes in GAG synthesis, newly synthesized [35S]sulfate-labeled GAG chains were isolated from chondroitinase ABC (Chase)-digested articular cartilage from patients ranging from 9 to 53 years of age (see Table I). These were found to produce two peaks when fractionated; peak I represents newly synthesized residual Chase-insensitive, non-CS chains (peak I, Kav = 0.11), and peak II represents the CS (and DS, peak II, Kav = 0.83) chains. Pooling of peak I and additional Chase digestion failed to yield extra CS chains, indicating that digestion was complete (not shown). The content of the Chase-insensitive, non-CS, peak I was not investigated. This analysis indicated that synthesis rates for both CS and non-CS GAGs declined with increasing age (Table I), and although total:CS GAG ratios decreased with age, this did not reach levels of statistical significance (R2 = 0.851; p = 0.09).Table IChange in [35S]sulfate incorporation (DPM / mg of weight) into newly synthesized CS and non-CS GAG (CS: total GAG ratios) in cultured cartilage of differing ageAgeNon-CSCSCS: totalyearsDPM / mg / wet weightDPM / mg / wet weight961223301:4.81263921841:4.42090230251:4.32990020051:3.2432615921:3.3532516201:3.5 Open table in a new tab Changes Induced by Treatment with rhIL-1α or rhTGF-β1—We then examined whether treatment with rhIL-1α or rhTGF-β1 modified such GAG synthetic rates in immature (<20 years; 28Doege K.J.

In contrast, rhTGF-β1 treatment produced statistically significant increases in the rate of GAG synthesis in immature, but not mature, samples (Fig. 2). Detailed analysis of the specific changes in newly synthesized non-CS and CS pools showed that rhIL-1α treatment significantly decreases the synthesis of both in cartilage from young and old specimens (Fig. 3). In contrast, treatment with rhTGF-β1 failed to significantly modify non-CS synthesis but produced statistically significant increases in the level of sulfate incorporated into CS in immature cartilage, but not older, mature cartilage (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Effect of rhIL-1α and rhTGF-β1 on [35S]sulfate incorporation (percentage of control untreated incorporation, ± S.E.) into CS and non-CS within GAG chains, in cartilage from immature(<20 years) and mature (>20 years) individuals. Tissue was either untreated (open) or cultured in the presence of 1 ng/ml rhIL-1α (hatched) or 10 ng/ml rhTGF-β1 (cross-hatched). Elution of chondroitinase ABC-digested tissue on a Sephadex G50 column separated the GAG chains into peak I (residual Chase-insensitive, non-CS, including KS/heparan sulfate (HS)) and peak II (CS/DS). The proportion of counts within each n was expressed as percentage of the control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Changes Associated with Cartilage Aging—Before examining whether treatment with rhIL-1α or rhTGF-β1 also modified CS sulfation, we determined age-related differences in CS sulfation patterns in cartilage and found that both newly synthesized and endogenous GAG chains show increases in C6S:C4S ratios associated with cartilage aging (Fig. 4A). A significant correlation with age in both endogenous (p < 0.01, R2 = 0.639) and newly synthesized (p < 0.02, R2 = 0.593) pools (Fig. 4A) was observed. In addition, a curve fit indicates the presence of a plateau in C6S:C4S ratios after the age of 20 years, as well as a rapid rise in these ratios during puberty (Fig. 4A). Evaluation of C6S:C4S ratios in distinct age groups indicates that the endogenous ratio of these isomers is significantly higher in older individuals (p < 0.001), from 0.90 ± 0.25 in immature to 4.00 ± 0.25 in mature samples (Fig. 4B). Although ratios of newly synthesized C6S:C4S showed a similar trend (1.30 ± 0.31 increasing to 2.83 ± 0.46), these did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4B). Changes Induced by Treatment with IL-1α or TGF-β1—Examination of the C6S:C4S ratio of cartilage GAGs (without reference to age) showed that treatment with rhTGF-β1 (67 ± 4% of controls), and more markedly, rhIL-1α (37 ± 4% of controls) significantly reduces C6S:C4S ratios in the newly synthesized pool (Fig. 5A). Neither of these agents altered the ratio in the endogenous pool (Fig. 5A), but both rhTGF-β1 and more markedly rhIL-1α reduce C6S:C4S ratios in newly synthesized GAGs (Fig. 5B). Closer examination, however, disclosed that the C6S:C4S ratio in newly synthesized and endogenous pools exhibits different age-related trends. Immature cartilage (<20 years) shows higher, and mature cartilage shows lower, C6S:C4S ratios in the synthesized pool of GAGs than in the endogenous pool (Fig. 4B). Absolute rates of C4S and C6S synthesis show that the rhIL-1-induced reduction in C6S:C4S ratios is achieved by diminution in both C4S and C6S at all ages, with consistently greater reduction in C6S (Fig. 6A). However, the rhTGF-β1-induced reduction in C6S:C4S ratios is nearly always associated with increased synthesis of both C4S and C6S, with consistently greater increases in C4S synthesis (Fig. 6B). Changes Associated with Chondrocyte Position and Cartilage Age—To determine the potential contribution of individual chondrocytes to such changes in GAG synthesis, we measured resident chondrocyte UDPGD activity using a quantitative cytochemical method and made an evaluation of age-related and TGF-β1 or IL-1α-induced alterations in distinct regions of articular cartilage. We found that chondrocytes resident in distinct cartilage zones showed statistically significant differences in UDPGD activity (Fig. 7, A and B), with lowest activities (MIE × 100/cell) evident in the superficial zone (Zone 1) and highest activities in deep cartilage (Zone 4). In all zones, but most markedly in the mid-zones (118 and 98% increase in zones 2 and 3, p < 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively), chondrocyte UDPGD activity was higher in mature than in immature cartilage (Fig. 7C). Indeed, an analysis of mid-zone chondrocyte UDPGD activity (Fig. 8A) discloses a significant correlation with age (R2 = 0.880), which is more accurately described by a binomial distribution (R2 = 0.988). Chondrocytes in both deep and superficial (not shown) regions fail to show this change (Fig. 8B).Fig. 8Age-related changes in UDPGD activity (MIE × 100/cell/30 min; mean ± S.E. for each individual sample) in chondrocytes in zone 3 “mid-chondrocytes” (A) and in deep, zone 4, cartilage (B). Zone 2 mid-zone chondrocytes, but not superficial chondrocytes, also showed similar age-related correlation in UDPGD activity (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We therefore examined only zones 2 and 3 in subsequent analyses. To examine whether chondrocyte UDPGD activity is modified by maintenance of cartilage explants in vitro, we measured UDPGD activity (zones 2/3) in fresh tissue (chilled immediately after isolation) and paired samples chilled after 2 days in culture. This showed (Fig. 9) that mid-zone chondrocyte UDPGD activity was unaffected by such treatment (Fig. 10).Fig. 10Effect of rhIL-1α and rhTGF-β1 on mid-zone (zones 2 and 3) chondrocyte UDPGD activity (substrate-specific; % control fresh samples; mean ± S.E.) in cartilage from immature (<20 years) and mature (>20 years) individuals (% untreated).*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.005; and ****, p < 0.001 versus control (cultured) samples. + denotes p < 0.001 significant difference from activity in zone 2 chondrocytes treated with rhTGF-β1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Changes Induced by Treatment with rhIL-1α or rhTGF-β1 (Immature versus Mature)—Chondrocyte UDPGD activity/cell in zones 2 and 3 of immature, as well as mature cartilage was unaffected by rhIL-1α treatment. In contrast, rhTGF-β1 treatment of immature cartilage produced significant increases in chondrocyte UDPGD activity (Fig. 10, Zone 2 > Zone 3). Furthermore, although rhTGF-β1 treatment of mature cartilage also increased chondrocyte UDPGD activity in the mid-zone, these changes were always significantly smaller than in the equivalent zone of immature cartilage (Fig. 10). Evaluation of this age-related decline in sensitivity of chondrocytes to rhTGF-β1 indicates a significant (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01) negative correlation between the magnitude of rhTGF-β1-induced increases in chondrocyte UDPGD activity and cartilage age (Fig. 11, A and B). This study shows that treatment of cultured segments of human articular cartilage with rhIL-1α results in: (i) a reduced total GAG synthesis, with depression in both CS and non-CS pools; (ii) a decrease in the ratio of C6S:C4S that consistently involves a greater diminution of C6S; and (iii) no modification in the maximum capacity of resident chondrocyte UDPGD activity.

Suramin was shown to inhibit both merozoite invasion and MSP142 proteolytic cleavage. This polysulfonated naphthylurea bound directly to recombinant P. falciparum MSP142 (Kd = 0.2 μm) and to Plasmodium vivax MSP142 (Kd = 0.3 μm) as measured by fluorescence enhancement in the presence of the protein and by isothermal titration calorimetry. Suramin bound only slightly less tightly to the P. vivax MSP133 (Kd = 1.5 μm) secondary processing product (fluorescence measurements), but very weakly to MSP119 (Kd ∼ 15 mm) (NMR measurements). Several residues in MSP119 were implicated in the interaction with suramin using NMR measurements. A series of symmetrical suramin analogues that differ in the number of aromatic rings and substitution patterns of the terminal naphthylamine groups was examined in invasion and processing assays. Two classes of analogue with either two or four bridging rings were found to be active in both assays, whereas two other classes without bridging rings were inactive. We propose that suramin and related compounds inhibit erythrocyte invasion by binding to MSP1 and by preventing its cleavage by the secondary processing protease. The results indicate that enzymatic events during invasion are suitable targets for drug development and validate the novel concept of an inhibitor binding to a macromolecular substrate to prevent its proteolysis by a protease.

The results indicate that enzymatic events during invasion are suitable targets for drug development and validate the novel concept of an inhibitor binding to a macromolecular substrate to prevent its proteolysis by a protease. Plasmodium falciparum develops and replicates within erythrocytes, releasing merozoites that invade new red blood cells. This stage of the parasite's life cycle is responsible for the disease malaria, and inhibition of merozoite invasion reduces parasitemia, with beneficial outcome for the host. Invasion is a complex process, involving interaction between parasite and host molecules; and although poorly understood at the molecular level, it may represent a new chemotherapeutic target. Current antimalarial drugs are becoming increasingly ineffective, and few new treatments have been developed in recent years (1Winstanley P.A. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 146-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). New drugs are required against established and novel targets, together with strategies to reverse resistance and to bypass toxicity of known antimalarial compounds (2Gutteridge W.E. Parassitologia (Rome). 1999; 41: 449-452PubMed Google Scholar). The development of compounds that are significantly different from those already in use or directed against new targets may delay the onset of resistance (3Olliaro P.L. Yuthavong Y. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 81: 91-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Several proteins have been identified on the surface of the merozoite (4Holder A.A. Parasitology. 1994; 108: S5-S18Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For example, merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1) 1The abbreviations used are: MSP1merozoite surface protein-1EGFepidermal growth factorNTSnaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acidPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.1The abbreviations used are: MSP1merozoite surface protein-1EGFepidermal growth factorNTSnaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acidPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. is synthesized as an ∼200-kDa precursor and is present on the surface of the late stage parasite within the erythrocyte. At or immediately prior to merozoite release, MSP1 is cleaved (primary processing) into four fragments that form part of a protein complex on the surface of the free merozoite. One of these fragments, the 42-kDa C-terminal polypeptide (MSP142), has a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor holding the complex to the parasite surface. Upon erythrocyte invasion, the protein complex is released from the merozoite surface following secondary processing, which involves a single proteolytic cleavage within MSP142. The 33-kDa N-terminal part of MSP142 is shed with the complex, whereas MSP119, the C-terminal part of MSP142, remains on the surface of the invading merozoite. MSP119 contains two epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains (5Morgan W.D. Birdsall B. Frenkiel T.A. Gradwell M.G. Burghaus P.A. Syed S.E.H. Uthaipibill C. Holder A.A. Feeney J. J. Mol.

Scott-Finnigan T.J. Shai S. Holder A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), suggesting that inhibitors of the protease responsible for MSP1 secondary processing would inhibit invasion.

We have chosen to examine suramin, a symmetrical hexasulfated naphthylurea, to explore its ability to bind to MSP1 and to inhibit invasion because it has been shown that this highly charged compound interferes with interaction of growth factors containing EGF domains with their receptors (7Middaugh C.R. Mach H. Burke C.J. Volkin D.B. Dabora J.M. Tsai P.K. Bruner M.W. Ryan J.A. Marfia K.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9016-9024Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Coffey Jr., R.J. Leof E.B.

Suramin has also been shown to inhibit invasion of HepG2 cells by P. falciparum sporozoites (11Muller H.-M. Reckmann I. Hollingdale M.R. Bujard H. Robson K.J.H. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Other polyanionic compounds such as sulfated polysaccharides are known to inhibit merozoite invasion (12Xiao L. Yang C. Patterson P.S. Udhayakumar V. Lal A.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1373-1378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Suramin has been used to treat African trypanosomiasis (13Klein F.K. Fischer W. Dtsch. Med. Wochenschr. 1923; 49: 1039Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and filariasis (14Hawking F. Adv. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1978; 15: 289-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although suramin is toxic, some of its analogues (15Balaban I.E. King H. J. Chem. Soc. 1927; : 3068-3097Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have been found to be much less toxic than suramin itself when tested in mice (16Braddock P.S. Hu D.-E. Fan T.-P.D. Stratford I.J. Harris A.L. Bicknell R. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 69: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here, we show that suramin binds to MSP142 and that such binding inhibits both MSP1 secondary processing and merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. Some suramin analogues are also shown to inhibit processing and invasion. Suramin (sodium salt, Antrypol, ICI) and suramin analogues (synthesized by Balaban and King in 1927 (15Balaban I.E. King H.

Asexual blood stages of P. falciparum (isolate FCB-1) were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI 1640/Albumax medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine as previously described (17Blackman M.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cultures were gassed with 7% CO2, 5% O2, and 88% N2 and maintained by routine passage in fresh human erythrocytes. Parasites were synchronized by Percoll and sorbitol treatment as described previously (18Holder A.A. Freeman R.R. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Briefly, schizonts were purified by centrifugation over Percoll and then returned to culture in the presence of fresh erythrocytes. After 4 h, during which time released merozoites invaded erythrocytes, the cells were treated with 5% sorbitol for 10 min to lyse the residual schizonts before returning the parasites to culture. Compounds were tested for their capacity to inhibit erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum in vitro using two approaches: a short-term assay in which the number of newly invaded erythrocytes was counted using microscopy and an assay measuring uptake of [3H]hypoxanthine. In the short-term assay (19Blackman M.J. Heidrich H.-G. Donachie S. McBride J.S. Holder A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), compounds were incubated in triplicate with cultures containing highly synchronous P. falciparum schizonts at ∼2% parasitemia and ∼2% hematocrit. After between 6 and 24 h, thin films were prepared, stained with Giemsa reagent, and examined by microscopy. The number of newly invaded ring stages was counted, and inhibition of invasion was expressed as percent invasion relative to a control untreated culture (calculated using the formula ((IC/(IC + UC))/(IA/(IA + UA))) × 100, where IC is the number of erythrocytes infected with ring stages, UC is the number of uninfected erythrocytes in the presence of the compound, IA is the number of erythrocytes infected with ring stages, and UA is the number of uninfected erythrocytes in the absence of the compound). Suramin and NTS were also assayed for P. falciparum invasion inhibition using [3H]hypoxanthine uptake (20Desjardins R.E. Canfield C.J. Haynes J.D. Chulay J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of the compounds were added in triplicate to cultures containing mature schizonts at a final parasitemia of ∼0.5% and a hematocrit of ∼2% in 96-well plates. Following incubation for 24 h to allow schizont rupture and erythrocyte invasion, [3H]hypoxanthine (0.5 μCi/well) was added. After a further 18 h of culture, cells were harvested onto glass-fiber filters (Filtermat A, Wallac, Turku, Finland) using a cell harvester. Filters were wetted with scintillation mixture, and bound radioactivity was quantified in a β-counter. Control incubations without compound or without parasites were included in each experiment. The amount of radioactivity in each sample was expressed as a percentage of activity in the control wells containing no compound. Three independent experiments were performed for each compound. P. falciparum merozoites were purified as described previously (17Blackman M.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) after release from mature schizonts into growth medium supplemented with 2 mm EGTA. Following sequential passage of culture supernatants through pre-wetted filters of 3- and 1.2-μm pore size, merozoites were harvested by centrifugation. Merozoites were washed with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of protease inhibitors (leupeptin, antipain, and aprotinin, each at 10 μg/ml). The merozoites were then resuspended in cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 plus 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, antipain, and aprotinin (processing buffer) and divided into 18-μl aliquots on ice. Two microliters of either diluted compound or reaction buffer were added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Control assays included those in which processing was prevented by immediate addition of SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), or 5 mm EGTA and those incubated in the absence of compound or in the presence of 0.2 mmNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. Processing was stopped by rapid solubilization into SDS, and MSP1 processing was analyzed by Western blotting (17Blackman M.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with rabbit anti-MSP133/MSP142 antibody, and the bands corresponding to MSP142 and MSP133 polypeptides were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. P. falciparum MSP142—The pET(AT)Pf-MSP142 plasmid was used to express a His6-tagged MSP142 protein (P. falciparum 3D7 clone, GenBank™/EBI accession number Z35327) essentially as described (21Angov E. Aufiero B.M. Turgeon A.M. Van Handenhove M. Ockenhouse C.F. Kester K.E. Walsh D.S. McBride J.S. Dubois M.C. Cohen J. Haynes J.D. Eckels K.H. Heppner D.G. Ballou W.R. Diggs C.L. Lyon J.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Following bacterial growth, protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C. After 2 h of additional growth, the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer, and lysed by microfluidization. The protein was purified by binding and elution from a column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (QIAGEN Inc.), followed by passage through two ion exchange columns (SuperQ 650M and CM 650M, TosoHaas). P. falciparum MSP119—P. falciparum MSP119 (Swiss-Prot accession number P04933) was expressed from a synthetic gene optimized for Pichia pastoris expression (36Holder, A., Birdsall, B., Feeney, J., Morgan, W., Syed, S., and Uthaipibull, C. (February 20, 2002) European Patent EP1180120Google Scholar). This sequence, inserted at the SnaBI site of vector pPIC9K (Invitrogen), contained the N-terminal sequence YHHHHHHIEGRH preceding the MSP119 sequence. A point mutation (Ser3 to Ala) was also introduced to eliminate the potential N-glycosylation site at Asn1. Following purification of MSP119 as described (5Morgan W.D. Birdsall B. Frenkiel T.A. Gradwell M.G. Burghaus P.A. Syed S.E.H. Uthaipibill C. Holder A.A. Feeney J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the N-terminal tag was cleaved with factor Xa (New England Biolabs Inc.), and MSP119 was purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200). The final product consisted of the 96-amino acid MSP119 fragment preceded by a single His residue. P. vivax MSP142—The sequence encoding MSP142 from P. vivax was cloned into plasmid jmp28, a modified pET28 vector that encodes the N-terminal MHHHHHHIEGRWIL peptide immediately upstream of the inserted sequence. P. vivax (Belem strain) DNA was used as a template for PCR-based cloning. The sequence of the expressed protein (following the vector-encoded N-terminal peptide) corresponds to Asp1325 to Ser1704 (GenBank™/EBI accession number A39401). The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells by induction of a culture at A600 = 0.6–0.8 with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were induced for 3 h at 37 °C and then harvested by centrifugation. The cells were lysed using the Bugbuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen). After centrifugation of the cell lysate, the pellet containing MSP142 was dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). This was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and washed with 10 column volumes of the loading buffer, followed by 6 column volumes of 8 m urea, 100 mm Na2HPO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.0 and 6 column volumes of the same buffer at pH 6.1. The protein was eluted in 3 column volumes of 8 m urea, 100 mm Na2HPO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 4.3). The protein was refolded by rapid dilution (1:50) into refolding buffer (55 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 264 mm NaCl, 11 mm KCl, 550 mm guanidine HCl, 1.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSH, and 0.1 mm GSSG) and incubation overnight at 18 °C. The protein was concentrated and then purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (26 × 600 mm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 250 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). Protein-containing peaks were pooled, diluted 5-fold into 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), applied to a Mono Q HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted using a 0–250 mm NaCl gradient. The protein eluted at 150–250 mm NaCl. The fractions containing MSP142 were pooled and dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline before use. P. vivax MSP133—P. vivax MSP133 was expressed using the P. vivax MSP142 clone described above as a template for PCR, followed by ligation of the product into the pET30Xa/LIC vector. The sequence expressed runs from Asp1325 to Ser1618 (GenBank™/EBI accession number A39401) following the N-terminal purification tag. The protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS cells as described above for P. vivax MSP142. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded directly onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The column was washed with 10 volumes of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) and with 6 column volumes of the same buffer containing 30 mm imidazole and finally eluted with 3 column volumes of the same buffer with 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was then loaded directly onto a Superdex 200 column (26 × 600 mm) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 250 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) and purified by gel filtration. The fractions containing MSP133 were pooled and dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline. The intrinsic fluorescence of suramin was used to determine its capacity to bind to MSP1-derived proteins. Fluorescence was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-3B or Spex Industries Fluoro Max-2 fluorometer. Suramin was excited at a wavelength of 315 or 330 nm at 2.5-nm resolution, and emission spectra were measured at wavelengths ranging from 350 to 450 nm. Suramin and the MSP1 proteins were diluted in 20 mm NaH2PO4 and 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.2 and analyzed at 10 or 20 °C. Titrations were performed by adding aliquots of the suramin solution to the MSP1 solution. In controls, suramin was titrated into buffer alone. The Kd for MSP1/suramin binding was determined from three independent experiments. Isothermal calorimetric titrations were performed using a Microcal Omega VP isothermal titration calorimeter. Tested proteins were dialyzed extensively against isothermal titration calorimetry buffer (phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4) before use. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. The calorimeter cell, which has an internal volume of 1.425 ml, contained 30 μm MSP142 or MSP133, which was titrated by injection of a total of 290 μl of 600 μm suramin. The heat of dilution of suramin into buffer alone was determined in control experiments. Data were fitted by least-squares methods using the Microcal Origin Version 5.0 evaluation software provided by the manufacturer. Each experiment was performed twice. NMR experiments were carried out on Varian spectrometers operating at proton frequencies of 500, 600, and 800 MHz. Suramin (0.03–16.0 mm) 1H spectra were recorded at 5–35 °C. The assignments of the 1H signals of suramin (except for the NH signals) were made by analysis of the two-dimensional gradient selected double quantum filtered COSY spectrum at 500 MHz at 25 °C on a sample containing 1 mm suramin in 50 mm potassium phosphate and 100 mm KCl in 90% H2O and 10% D2O at pH 6.5. The NH assignments were made on the basis of nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy experiments (Fig. 2). The assignments agree with those reported previously (22Polenova T. Iwashita T. Palmer III, A.G. McDermott A.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14202-14217Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). MSP119/suramin samples were examined with either unlabeled or 15N-labeled MSP119 in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm NaCl in 90% H2O and 10% D2O at pH 6.5 (pH values are pH* meter readings uncorrected for deuterium isotope effects). Titration was carried out by mixing two samples each containing 0.1 mm MSP119 and with one also containing 16 mm suramin. One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR spectra were recorded for each concentration of suramin. Nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectra were recorded on MSP119/suramin samples in D2O (1.76 mm protein and 6 mm suramin in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm NaCl at pH 6.5); these spectra were compared with MSP119 spectra recorded in the absence of suramin to detect any suramin-induced changes in 1H chemical shifts for protein side chain resonances. Suramin Inhibits Erythrocyte Invasion by Merozoites and MSP1 Secondary Processing—Suramin inhibition of erythrocyte invasion was measured both by microscopic examination of cultures following staining with Giemsa reagent and by biosynthetic incorporation of [3H]hypoxanthine. As shown in Fig. 3, suramin inhibited invasion in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 60 ± 9 μm, whereas NTS did not inhibit invasion at 200 μm, the highest concentration tested. Similar results were obtained in both assays. Free merozoites were observed in the stained samples, suggesting that suramin does not inhibit merozoite release from schizonts, but does prevent invasion, confirming our earlier findings. 2Dluzewski, A. R., Pinder, J. C., Garcia, C. R., and Markus, R. P. (2000) Abstract presented at the Molecular Approaches to Malaria (MAM2000) Conference, Lorne, Australia (February 2–5, 2000). At these concentrations, suramin had no effect on the intracellular growth of the parasite (data not shown). Suramin was shown to inhibit secondary processing of MSP142 in extracts of merozoites (Fig. 4A). Following a 1-h incubation of merozoites in the presence of suramin or control compounds, no MSP133 product was detected in the sample incubated with 1 mm PMSF (a potent inhibitor of processing) or 200 μm suramin. In contrast, 200 μm NTS had no effect on MSP1 secondary processing, with clear formation of MSP133 occurring in the NTS-treated sample. Significant MSP1 cleavage was detected only in samples incubated with 12.5 μm or lower concentrations of suramin (Fig. 4B). Suramin Binds to MSP142 and MSP133—The intrinsic fluorescence of suramin is low when excited at 315 nm; but when it bound to MSP142, it exhibited a pronounced increase in emission intensity, with the maximum emission wavelength shifted slightly from 408 to 411 nm (Fig. 5, inset). This fluorescence enhancement was used to measure binding of suramin to MSP142 from P. falciparum. Following titration of a solution of MSP142 with suramin, the marked increase in the fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of suramin concentration (Fig. 5). Analysis of the binding data revealed that suramin bound to P. falciparum MSP142 with a Kd of 0.22 ± 0.04 μm. MSP133 from P. falciparum is soluble to only 0.15 mg/ml in aqueous buffers and aggregates significantly even at these concentrations, preventing measurements of suramin binding in vitro. However MSP133 from P. vivax is soluble to at least 20 mg/ml and hence amenable to in vitro methods of measuring suramin binding. When analyzed by fluorometry, P. vivax MSP142 and MSP133 showed large binding-induced enhancements of the intrinsic suramin fluorescence similar to that observed with P. falciparum MSP142. P. vivax MSP142 bound suramin with a Kd of 0.3 ± 0.1 μm compared with 0.22 ± 0.04 μm for P. falciparum MSP142. MSP133 from P. vivax showed a high affinity site that was 5-fold weaker compared with MSP142 (Kd = 1.5 ± 0.5 μm). The ΔH values analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry (11 ± 1 kcal/mol for MSP142 and 12 ± 1 kcal/mol for MSP133) are also very similar. At the high concentrations (>30 μm) required for isothermal titration calorimetric analysis, there was evidence for some nonspecific binding. The suramin binding for MSP133 was only 5-fold weaker than that for MSP142; and this, taken together with the similar large induced fluorescence enhancements, indicates that there is a similar hydrophobic suramin-binding pocket in the two proteins. Suramin Binds to MSP119—No fluorescence enhancement was observed when suramin was added to MSP119 from P. falciparum; and thus, suramin binding to MSP119 could not be determined by fluorescence measurements. However, using NMR, it was possible to follow changes in chemical shifts of the 1H and 15N signals in 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy experiments when titrating 15N-labeled MSP119 with suramin. At the maximum concentration of suramin used (16 mm), ∼50% of MSP119 was complexed with the ligand. The residues that showed the largest shifts upon addition of suramin were Ile2, His5, Phe19, His21, Leu22, and Arg25. The shifts were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis to a single binding curve and gave an average Kd of ∼15 ± 5 mm (Fig. 6). Suramin seems to bind weakly to a site or sites near the N terminus of the protein, as indicated in Fig. 7, which shows the positions of the affected MSP119 residues in a three-dimensional structure. All of the observed shifts were very small, <0.15 ppm for the NH 1H signals. The chemical shift of the protein aromatic ring protons showed almost no change, and the protons on suramin itself showed shifts of <0.05 ppm. These small changes indicate that suramin does not bind to MSP119 in a hydrophobic pocket (see “Discussion”).Fig. 7Structure of MSP19 determined by NMR (5Morgan W.D. Birdsall B. Frenkiel T.A.

Four series of symmetrical compounds (Groups A–D) (Fig. 1) differing in the number of central aminobenzoylurea units and having various substitutions on the terminal naphthyl rings were examined. None of the Group A compounds or the single compound (D1) in Group D inhibited invasion in vitro at 200 μm, the highest concentration tested (Fig. 8, A and D). However, all Group B and C compounds inhibited invasion in vitro (Fig. 8, B and C), with IC50 values similar to that of suramin. The suramin analogues differ in toxicity (16Braddock P.S. Hu D.-E. Fan T.-P.D. Stratford I.J. Harris A.L. Bicknell R. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 69: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), with the least toxic inhibitory compound (B1) being ∼10 times less toxic than suramin. 3J. Walker, unpublished data. All of the compounds that inhibited invasion also inhibited MSP142 processing (Fig. 9, B and C), whereas those that did not inhibit invasion also did not inhibit processing (Fig. 9, A and D) when tested at a concentration of 200 μm. Similar parasite invasion and MSP1 processing assays could not be carried out for P. vivax because this species cannot be cultured in vitro.Fig. 9Some analogues of suramin inhibit secondary processing of MSP1 as detected by Western blotting.

https://openalex.org/W1998214332,"We recently reported that internal deletion of PTEN tumor suppressor gene in OPM2 and Delta47 myeloma lines led to high Akt activation. Re-expression of PTEN induced strong apoptosis and growth inhibition. To understand the biologic importance of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation affected by PTEN deletion, we analysed apoptosis and growth inhibition by applying PI3K inhibitors to myeloma lines and by expressing Akt constructs. The PI3K inhibitors preferentially suppressed PTEN-null myeloma growth to those expressing PTEN, indicating that PI3K activation is more critical for growth and survival of those lines with PTEN mutations than others expressing a functional PTEN gene. Since PTEN-null myeloma lines exhibited much stronger Akt activation than PTEN-expressing cells in response to insulin-like growth factor I stimulation, we determined whether Akt could be responsible for PI3K-mediated cell survival and growth of PTEN-null myeloma lines. Expression of an active Akt, but not its kinase dead mutant, reversed wortmannin- and dexamethasone-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition in PTEN-null myeloma lines, suggesting that Akt lies downstream of PI3K for PTEN-null myeloma survival and dexamethasone resistance. In summary, we have provided evidence that PTEN-null myeloma cells are stringently dependent on the PI3K/Akt activation for cell survival. These results may provide a basis to treat myeloma patients with PI3K and Akt inhibitors."

Previously, we identified three RANKL isoforms from mouse cDNA and named them RANKL1, RANKL2, and RANKL3 (13Ikeda T. Kasai M. Utsuyama M. Hirokawa K. Endocrinology. 2000; 142: 1419-1426Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). RANKL1 was identical to the originally reported RANKL. RANKL2 had a shorter intracellular domain. RANKL3 did not have the intracellular or transmembrane domains and was suggested to be a soluble form protein. Previous findings showed that both tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and TNF-β formed trimers, and the multimeric structure was essential for expressing the activities of the molecules (14Smith R.A.

Recently, the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of mouse RANKL was determined, and it was shown to form a trimeric structure (17Ito S. Wakabayashi K. Ubukata O. Hayashi S. Okada F. Hata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6631-6636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Lam J. Nelson C.A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Fremont D.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The present study revealed that the mouse RANKL isoforms interact and express different biological activities. Transfection and Selection—For immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy, the protein-coding region of cDNA for each RANKL isoform was cloned into pEGFP-N2 and pDsRed-N1 vectors (Clontech), both of which express the product of inserted cDNA as a fusion to the N terminus of fluorescent protein, EGFP and DsRed, respectively. For osteoclastogenesis assay, each RANKL isoform was cloned into selectable mammalian expression vector, pMIK HygB (13Ikeda T. Kasai M. Utsuyama M. Hirokawa K. Endocrinology. 2000; 142: 1419-1426Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar), pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), or pEFBOSbsr (19Hachiya A. Aizawa S. Tanaka M. Takahashi Y. Ida S. Gatanaga H. Hirabayashi Y. Kojima A. Tatsumi M. Oka S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using the TransFast transfection reagent (Promega). NIH3T3 cells transfected with pMIK HygB-RANKL were cultured in α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 250 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Cal-biochem). In some clones expressing each RANKL isoform, pcDNA3.1-RANKL was additionally transfected. The cells were selected and maintained in the medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Sigma) in addition to the Hygromycin B. To obtain cells expressing RANKL1, RANKL2, and RANKL3, pEFBOSbsr-RANKL3 was further transfected to the cells expressing RANKL1 and RANKL2. Cells were selected and maintained in the medium supplemented with 0.2 μg/ml Blasticidin S hydrochloride (Funakoshi) in addition to the Hygromycin B and Geneticin. The expression of each RANKL isoform was analyzed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Northern hybridization. RT-PCR was performed as described previously (13Ikeda T. Kasai M. Utsuyama M. Hirokawa K. Endocrinology. 2000; 142: 1419-1426Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) using forward primers, 5′-CTGAGCTATTCCAGAAGTAGTGAGGAGG-3′, 5′-CTGCAGATATCCAGCACAGTGGCG-3′, and 5′-TCGCAACGGGTTTGCCGCCAGAAC-3′, which recognized downstream from the transcriptional initiation site of pMIK HygB, pcDNA3.1, and pEFBOSbsr, respectively, and a common reverse primer, 5′-TCAGTCTATGTCCTGAACTTTGAAAGCCCC-3′, which recognized the 3′ end of the inserted mouse RANKL cDNA. Northern hybridization was performed as described previously (13Ikeda T. Kasai M. Utsuyama M. Hirokawa K. Endocrinology. 2000; 142: 1419-1426Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—RANKL-pDsRed and/or RANKL-pEGFP were transfected to NIH3T3 cells plated in 100-mm-type culture dishes. After 48 h, cells were collected and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.1) containing 1% digitonin, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 100 μmN-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and the supernatants were precleared with Sepharose 4B coupling with 100 μg of rabbit immunoglobulins and incubated with 40 μg of rabbit anti-DsRed-peptide antibody (Clontech, catalog number 8370) cross-linked to immobilized Protein G (Pierce, catalog number 45210) for 72 h. The immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer three times and eluted with 100 μl of elution buffer (1% digitonin, 50 mm glycin-HCl (pH 3.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3). The eluant was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Immunoblotting was performed using the rabbit anti-DsRed-peptide antibody or a mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Clontech, catalog number 8371). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cross-linking of Recombinant RANKL3 Protein—Five μg of recombinant mouse RANKL3 (13Ikeda T. Kasai M. Utsuyama M. Hirokawa K. Endocrinology. 2000; 142: 1419-1426Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) was treated with 1.2 mg/ml ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) (Pierce) at 4 °C for 2 h. Part of the cross-linked samples was cleaved using 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride (Pierce), pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 4 h. The samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Confocal Microscopy—RANKL-pDsRed and/or RANKL-pEGFP were transfected to NIH3T3 cells plated on 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (Iwaki Glass). After 48 h, they were viewed before or after fixation with 3.8% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline using an LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a ×63 water immersion objective. EGFP was examined using the 488-nm line of the argon-krypton laser and a set of the 488-nm main splitter and the 505–530-nm band pass emission. DsRed was examined using the 543-nm line of the helium-neon laser and a set of the 488/543-nm main splitter HFT and the 560-nm long pass emission. Osteoclastogenesis Assays and Cytochemical Staining—Mouse bone marrow macrophages were prepared from femora and tibiae of 5-week-old female ddy mice as described previously (20Shioi A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 55: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Inoue M. Namba N. Chappel J. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using 48-well plates, the bone marrow macrophages (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were cocultured with NIH3T3 cells expressing RANKL isoform(s) (1.5 × 104 cells/well) in 0.25 ml/well of α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 1 × 10-8m of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and 1 × 10-7m of dexamethasone. After 5–10 days of culture, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (-) for 10 min and ice-cold methanol-acetone (1:1) for 2 min. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) was stained with 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.1 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma), 0.6 mg/ml fast red AL salt (Sigma), and 50 mm sodium tartrate (Wako). Statistical significance was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Animal care was in accordance with guidelines for animal welfare in Tokyo Medical and Dental University. In Vitro Formation of Resorption Lacunae—Whale dentin slices were placed on 48-well plates, and cocultures were performed on them (5Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Kodama H. Martin J. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Ten days after the culture period, the slices were soaked in 4 m guanidine thiocyanate solution for 24 h, rinsed with distilled water, and stained with Meyer's hematoxylin. The area of resorption lacunae was quantified using the net micrometer disk in the eyepiece of a microscope, and the ratios of standard areas with resorption lacunae to the areas with and without resorption lacunae were calculated (22Yamato H. Okazaki R. Ishii T. Ogata E. Sato T. Kumegawa M. Akaogi K. Taniguchi N. Matsumoto T. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1993; 52: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The statistical significance was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Immunohistochemistry—Cells were treated with 0.1% hydrogen peroxide in 95% methanol for 5 min, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with 2% bovine serum albumin (Serologicals Proteins) at 4 °C overnight. An antibody against calcitonin receptors (CT-Rs) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number 8860) or the antibody preabsorbed with the blocking peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was applied on the specimens and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, immunohistochemistry was performed using the ENVISION Plus system (DAKO). Interaction of Three RANKL Isoforms—Constructs of RANKL1, RANKL2, and RANKL3 with a tag of EGFP at the C terminus and RANKL1, RANKL2, and RANKL3 with a tag of DsRed at the C terminus were transfected to NIH3T3 cells and served for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The expression of transfected RANKL1-DsRed (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4) and RANKL2-DsRed (Fig. 1A, lane 5) was detected in whole cell lysates with the anti-DsRed antibody (Fig. 1A). The expression of RANKL1-EGFP (Fig. 1B, lane 2), RANKL2-EGFP (Fig. 1B, lane 3), and RANKL3-EGFP (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5) was detected with the anti-EGFP antibody. Immunoprecipitation of RANKL-DsRed with the anti-DsRed antibody was confirmed using the same antibody. Immunoprecipitation of RANKL1-DsRed (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–4) and RANKL2-DsRed (Fig. 1C, lane 5) was detected among nonspecific background signals. In the specimens cotransfected with RANKL1-DsRed and RANKL1-EGFP and immunoprecipitated with the anti-DsRed antibody, coprecipitation of RANKL1-EGFP protein was detected with the anti-EGFP antibody (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Coprecipitation of RANKL2-EGFP was also detected in the specimen cotransfected with RANKL1-DsRed and RANKL2-EGFP (Fig. 1D, lane 3). In the specimens cotransfected with RANKL1-DsRed and RANKL3-EGFP in addition to RANKL2-DsRed and RANKL3-EGFP, no RANKL3-EGFP protein was detected (Fig. 1D, lanes 4 and 5). To confirm the interaction of RANKL3 protein, recombinant RANKL3 protein was cross-linked with EGS and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Recombinant RANKL3 treated with EGS revealed a trimer (66 kDa) and a small amount of dimer (44 kDa) (Fig. 2, lane 2), which was specifically cleaved by hydroxylamine hydrochloride to a dimer and monomer (Fig. 2, lane 3). Similar results were also obtained using bis-[2-(succinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone (BSO-COES) as the cross-linker. 2T. Ikeda and J. Suzuki, unpublished data. In addition, intracellular localization of three RANKL isoforms was analyzed by means of detecting the tagged fluorescence protein using a confocal microscope. Both RANKL1 and RANKL2 were scattered as rough dots over the cytoplasmic region of the cells, but RANKL3 was located as fine granules over the cells (Fig. 3, A–C). In the cells cotransfected with RANKL1-DsRed and RANKL1-EGFP, both RANKL1-DsRed (Fig. 3D) and RANKL1-EGFP (Fig. 3E) were colocalized almost identically (Fig. 3F). In the cells cotransfected with RANKL1-DsRed and RANKL2-EGFP, both RANKL1-DsRed (Fig. 3G) and RANKL2-EGFP (Fig. 3H) were colocalized, but the identity was not as complete as RANKL1-DsRed and RANKL1-EGFP (Fig. 3I). Colocalizations of RANKL1-DsRed (Fig. 3J) and RANKL3-EGFP (Fig. 3K) and of RANKL2-DsRed (Fig. 3M) and RANKL3-EGFP (Fig. 3N) were poorer, but in some regions of the cytoplasms of the cells, colocalized dots were detected (Fig. 3, L and O). Functions of RANKL Isoforms on Osteoclastogenesis—We produced NIH3T3 cells expressing each RANKL isoform or different RANKL isoforms, and several clones for each transformant were used as stromal cells for in vitro osteoclastogenesis assay. In addition to macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dexamethasone were further supplemented with the culture medium to down-regulate the expression of OPG of both NIH3T3 cells and macrophages (Fig. 4A). NIH3T3 cells expressing RANKL1 or RANKL2 induced TRAP-positive mononuclear preosteoclasts, but few multinucleated osteoclasts were formed (Fig. 4B, a and b). NIH3T3 cells expressing RANKL3 did not induce any TRAP-positive cells (Fig. 4B, c). NIH3T3 cells showing coexpression of RANKL1 and RANKL2 induced markedly expanded multinucleated osteoclasts. Most of the culture area was covered with the multinucleated osteoclasts, and few mononuclear TRAP-positive preosteoclasts were observed at 1 week after the coculture (Fig. 4B, d). NIH3T3 cells with coexpression of RANKL1 and RANKL3 and of RANKL2 and RANKL3 induced mononuclear TRAP-positive preosteoclasts, but the additional expression of RANKL3 did not change the number significantly (Fig. 4B, e and f, and 4C). To elucidate whether the coexpression of RANKL1 and RANKL2 in the same cell is necessary to induce multinucleated osteoclasts, NIH3T3 cells expressing RANKL1 were mixed with the cells expressing RANKL2 and then used for coculture. Mixture of RANKL1-expressing cells and RANKL2-expressing cells induced mononuclear TRAP-positive preosteoclasts but did not induce multinucleated osteoclasts (Fig. 4B, g, and 4D). There is also a possibility that additional expression of the same RANKL isoform promotes the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts. To evaluate this, pcDNA3.1-RANKL1 or pcDNA3.1-RANKL2 was additionally transfected to cells showing the expression of RANKL1 or RANKL2, respectively. Additional expression of RANKL1 and additional expression of RANKL2 induced a few multinucleated osteoclasts (Fig. 4B, h, and data not shown). The expressions of RANKL1 in NIH3T3 cells used in the experiments shown in Fig. 4B, a, and 4B, h, are shown in Fig. 4E. Previously, we reported that all the analyzed organs and a bone marrow stromal cell line ST2 expressed the three RANKL isoforms (13Ikeda T. Kasai M. Utsuyama M. Hirokawa K. Endocrinology. 2000; 142: 1419-1426Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Then, we further added the expression of RANKL3 in the NIH3T3 cells expressing RANKL1 and RANKL2 (Fig. 5, A and B). Additional expression of RANKL3 significantly decreased the formation of osteoclasts, and many unfused mononuclear TRAP-positive preosteoclasts were observed (Fig. 5C, a and b, and 5D). The cocultures using NIH3T3 cells expressing RANKL1 and RANKL2 formed relatively large resorption lacunae on the dentin slices (Fig. 5C, c). On the dentin slices of the cocultures using NIH3T3 cells expressing RANKL1, RANKL2, and RANKL3, resorption lacunae were also formed, but the size was smaller (Fig. 5C, d). The area of the resorption lacunae on the dentin slices in the cocultures using NIH3T3 cells expressing RANKL1, RANKL2, and RANKL3 was significantly decreased as compared with that in the cocultures expressing RANKL1 and RANKL2 (Fig. 5E). To further analyze the effect of RANKL3 on the phenotypes of osteoclasts, the presence of CT-Rs was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In the cocultures of bone marrow macrophages and NIH3T3 cells expressing RANKL1, RANKL2, and RANKL3, CT-Rs were detected in both mononuclear and multinucleated cells (Fig. 5C, e) as reported previously in cocultures of mouse spleen cells and ST2 cells (5Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Kodama H. Martin J. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In the cocultures analyzed with the anti-CT-Rs antibody preabsorbed with the blocking peptide, no CT-R-positive cell was found (Fig. 5C, f). RANKL, a member of TNF, had been expected to form multimeric structures similar to TNF-α and TNF-β. Studies of sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation and crystallography showed that the extracellular domain of RANKL forms trimeric structures (17Ito S. Wakabayashi K. Ubukata O. Hayashi S. Okada F. Hata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6631-6636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Lam J. Nelson C.A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Fremont D.H. J. Clin.

Ellis B. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we previously identified three isoforms of mouse RANKL cDNA. One was identical to the originally reported RANKL, another had a shorter intracellular domain, and the other lacked the intracellular and transmembrane domains, which were named RANKL1, RANKL2, and RANKL3, respectively (13Ikeda T. Kasai M. Utsuyama M. Hirokawa K. Endocrinology. 2000; 142: 1419-1426Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that these RANKL isoforms interact. Here, we showed interactions of RANKL1 with RANKL1 or RANKL2 by immunoprecipitation using the proteins tagged with EGFP or DsRed (Fig. 1). However, RANKL3 did not precipitate with RANKL1 or RANKL2. Since RANKL3 has the complete extracellular domain of RANKL, RANKL3 may interact with RANKL isoforms as reported previously (17Ito S. Wakabayashi K. Ubukata O. Hayashi S. Okada F. Hata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6631-6636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Lam J. Nelson C.A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Fremont D.H. J. Clin.

Ellis B. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Next, we showed that recombinant RANKL3 without the tag interacts and forms a trimer by a cross-linking study (Fig. 2). From these results, it was suggested that RANKL3 also interacts with other RANKL isoforms at the extracellular domain and forms homo- or heterotrimers, although we do not have direct evidence for multimerization of RANKL3 to RANKL1 and RANKL2. In addition, the findings suggest that the tagged proteins do not influence the multimerization of RANKL, and thus RANKL1 interacts with RANKL1 and RANKL2. Although interaction of RANKL1 with RANKL1 or RANKL2 was detected by immunoprecipitation, the interaction was suggested to be weak because the interaction was not seen when cells were lysed with the lysis buffer containing Nonidet P-40 and was only detected when one of the very mild detergents, digitonin, was used in place of Nonidet P-40. 3M. Kasai and T. Ikeda, unpublished data. Poorer colocalization of RANKL3 with RANKL1 or RANKL2 in the transfected cells (Fig. 3) suggests that the interaction of RANKL3 is still weaker than RANKL1 or RANKL2, and this might be the reason for the dissociation of RANKL3. Localization of RANKL3 was different from those of RANKL1 and RANKL2 (Fig. 3), and the diffuse distribution of RANKL3 in the cytoplasmic region suggests that RANKL3 was not transported and secreted adequately, and accumulated in the cytoplasmic region. This might be true because in the cocultures using NIH3T3 cells expressing RANKL3, neither preosteoclasts nor osteoclasts were formed (Fig. 4B, c), although recombinant RANKL3 protein induced osteoclasts when administered to bone marrow macrophages.2 However, there is also a possibility that RANKL3 is secreted as a soluble form protein, but it diffuses in the culture medium, and the final concentration is not sufficient to induce preosteoclasts or osteoclasts. Coexpression of RANKL1 and RANKL2 markedly enhanced the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts, but a mixture of RANKL1-expressing cells and RANKL2-expressing cells did not. These findings suggest that the coexpression of both RANKL1 and RANKL2 in the same cells is important for the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, RANKL isoforms interact with one another, and the coexpression is suggested to form heteromultimers of RANKL1 and RANKL2. However, overexpression of RANKL1 or RANKL2 also induced multinucleated osteoclasts. These results suggest that heteromultimers of RANKL1 and RANKL2 markedly stimulate fusion of preosteoclasts in this assay system, but they are not essential to fusion of preosteoclasts, and these results also suggest that higher expression of RANKL1 or RANKL2 is necessary for fusion than formation of preosteoclasts. As described above, RANKL3 induced neither preosteoclasts nor osteoclasts, and the additional expression of RANKL3 to RANKL1 or RANKL2 did not change the formation of preosteoclasts (Fig. 4B, e and f, and 4C). However, the expression of RANKL3 significantly decreased the percent of multinucleated osteoclasts/total TRAP-positive cells when coexpressed with RANKL1 and RANKL2. These results suggest that RANKL3 specifically inhibits fusion of preosteoclasts when coexpressed with RANKL1 and RANKL2. Considering the multimerization of RANKL isoforms, the mechanism to inhibit the fusion of preosteoclasts by the expression of RANKL3 might be associated with intracellular interactions of RANKL3 with RANKL1 and/or RANKL2. As shown in Fig. 5C, e, the expression of CT-Rs was detected in preosteoclasts and osteoclasts induced by NIH3T3 cells expressing RANKL1, RANKL2, and RANKL3. These findings confirm that the expression of RANKL3 does not affect phenotypes of preosteoclasts and osteoclasts but inhibits only fusion of preosteoclasts. The findings in the present study strongly suggest that multiple multimeric structures of RANKL are present and regulate bone metabolism. Drugs with selectable regulation of the expression of each RANKL isoform may work as regulators of bone metabolism. Furthermore, RANKL has multiple functions throughout osteoclastogenesis: differentiation and fusion of osteoclast progenitor cells and activation and survival of osteoclasts (24Fuller K. Wong B.

https://openalex.org/W2000126148,"Recent studies indicate a potential role for Fra-1, a heterodimeric partner of activator protein 1 (AP1), in toxicant-induced epithelial injury, repair, and cellular transformation. Here, we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of fra-1 by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, which are the direct targets of inhaled toxins/carcinogens. In contrast to a transient induction by H2O2, TPA persistently activated fra-1 transcription, principally at the transcriptional level. A deletion analysis of the fra-1 promoter revealed that several cis-elements located between –105/+32 and –283/–105 bp mediate minimal and basal promoter activities, respectively. A region between –379 and –283 bp, which harbors a putative TPA response element, a GC box, and an Ets-like binding site, was required for high level TPA-inducible expression. Mutations in any of these cis-elements markedly reduced both basal and TPA-inducible expression. Thus, cooperative interactions between factors binding to multiple cis-elements of the –379/–283 promoter region appear to regulate TPA-induced fra-1 transcription in HBE cells. Consistent with this finding, electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated the formation of multiple complexes consisting of the AP1-, Sp-, and ETS-specific family of transcription factors with the –379/–283 fragment. Members of the AP1 family distinctly regulated the fra-1 promoter. In particular, coexpression of c-Jun, Jun-D, and Fra-2 up-regulated fra-1 transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed an enhanced recruitment of c-Jun, Jun-D, and Fra-2 to the endogenous fra-1 promoter upon TPA stimulation. These results underscore the regulatory role of c-Jun, Jun-D, and Fra-2 in TPA-inducible fra-1 expression in HBE cells in vivo.

The Jun (c-Jun, Jun-B, and Jun-D) and Fos (c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-1, and Fra-2) families of transcription factors form heterodimeric complexes referred to as activator protein 1 (AP1). 1The abbreviations: AP1activator protein-1ChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationEBSEts-binding sitecGC boxconsensus GC box or Sp1 siteHBEhuman bronchial epithelialLucluciferaseTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateTRETPA response elementcTREconsensus TREEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayEGFepidermal growth factor;. AP1 has been shown to act as a “master switch” for diverse stimuli and to regulate the expression of genes involved in various biological processes (1Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar, 3Shaulian E.

Upon activation, specific combinations of AP1 proteins bind to TPA response elements (TREs) and induce the transcription of variety of genes in a context-dependent manner (1Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin.

Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2410-2412Crossref Scopus (606) Google Scholar). AP1 proteins can also form heterodimers with other members of the leucine zipper superfamily of transcription factors, such as activation transcription factors (ATFs/CREBs), Nrf/Mafs, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (5Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). These interactions not only result in differential DNA binding of AP1 proteins to various promoters but also increase the repertoire of genes controlled by AP1 proteins in a given cell type (5Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). activator protein-1 chromatin immunoprecipitation Ets-binding site consensus GC box or Sp1 site human bronchial epithelial luciferase 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate TPA response element consensus TRE electrophoretic mobility shift assay epidermal growth factor;. A critical part of such regulation is the maintenance of optimal intracellular levels of specific AP1 proteins. Thus, the regulation of AP1 protein levels itself contributes to the strength of gene expression and, as a result, influences the outcome of various biological responses (5Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Since TREs are often embedded in antioxidant response elements, which are commonly found in the regulatory regions of several antioxidant enzymes (6Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), AP1 proteins have been suggested to play both pro- and antiregulatory roles in pulmonary insult, injury, and repair (7Adiseshaiah P. Vuong H. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165 (abstr.): 626Google Scholar). Gene ablation studies have demonstrated that c-jun, jun-B, and fra-1 are critical for normal embryonic development, whereas jun-D, c-fos, fos-B, and fra-2 are required for proper postnatal growth (4Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2410-2412Crossref Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 8Passegue E. Jochum W. Behrens A. Ricci R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies of transgenic mice have indicated that some AP1 proteins are associated with specific and distinct phenotypes, including cellular transformation (4Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2410-2412Crossref Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Although several contrasting roles for AP1 proteins have been suggested in the literature (4Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2410-2412Crossref Scopus (606) Google Scholar), Passegue et al. (8Passegue E. Jochum W. Behrens A. Ricci R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have shown by use of transgenic techniques that reconstitution of jun-B into the c-jun locus can overcome the liver and cardiac defects observed in c-jun–/– mice. However, expression of jun-B in c-jun–/– mice or, conversely, c-jun in jun-B–/– mice cannot restore normal function. These observations suggest that temporal and spatial expression of AP1 family members rather than their protein structure per se plays a critical role in controlling various biological processes (8Passegue E. Jochum W. Behrens A. Ricci R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Weitzman J.B. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 128-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Indeed, a comparison of the regulatory (promoter) regions of the AP1 proteins did not reveal a significant conservation of the cis-acting motifs, suggesting that their expression is differentially controlled. Emerging evidence indicates that Fra-1 plays a central role in pulmonary defense, injury repair, and transformation (7Adiseshaiah P. Vuong H. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165 (abstr.): 626Google Scholar). For example, tobacco smoke (10Reddy S.P. Vuong H. Adiseshaiah P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165 (abstr.): 828Google Scholar), silica (11Shukla A. Timblin C.R. Hubbard A.K. Bravman J. Mossman B.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1791-1795PubMed Google Scholar), and asbestos (12Heintz N.H. Janssen Y.M. Mossman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reddy S.P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165 (abstr.): 626Google Scholar). Moreover, fra-1 is highly overexpressed in asbestos-induced lung tumors in a rat model (14Sandhu H. Dehnen W. Roller M. Abel J. Unfried K. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and has been reported to play a critical role in the transformation of mesothelial cells (15Ramos-Nino M.E. Timblin C.R. Mossman B.T. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6065-6069PubMed Google Scholar). A differential requirement for Fra-1, but not Fra-2, in TPA- and EGF-induced transformation of epidermal cells has also been documented in other studies (16Young M.R. Nair R. Bucheimer N. Tulsian P. Brown N. Chapp C. Hsu T.C. Colburn N.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Fra-1 and Fra-2 have diametrically opposite effects on the gene expression associated with airway squamous metaplasia (17Patterson T. Vuong H. Y-S. L. Wu R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Vuong H. Patterson T. Adiseshaiah P. Shapiro P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, a high level of fra-1 expression is found in stomach (19Matsui M. Tokuhara M. Konuma Y. Nomura N. Ishizaki R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 249-255PubMed Google Scholar) and esophageal (20Hu Y.C. Lam K.Y. Law S. Wong J. Srivastava G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2213-2221PubMed Google Scholar) squamous cell carcinomas, breast tumor cells (21Zajchowski D.A. Bartholdi M.F. Gong Y. Webster L. Liu H.L. Munishkin A. Beauheim C. Harvey S. Ethier S.P. Johnson P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5168-5178PubMed Google Scholar), and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (a tobacco carcinogen)-induced lung tumors (10Reddy S.P. Vuong H. Adiseshaiah P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165 (abstr.): 828Google Scholar). Also consistent with these observations, formation of lung tumors has been noted in transgenic mice overexpressing fra-1 (22Jochum W. David J.P. Elliott C. Wutz A. Plenk Jr., H. Matsuo K. Wagner E.F. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations highlight a major role for Fra-1 in toxicant-induced gene expression and cellular transformation. Although an enhanced expression of fra-1 correlates with a malignant phenotype (22Jochum W. David J.P. Elliott C. Wutz A. Plenk Jr., H. Matsuo K. Wagner E.F. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), the mechanisms regulating fra-1 in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells in response to various toxicants, carcinogens, and mitogens have not been defined. We hypothesized that the sustained expression of fra-1 in response to toxicants/mitogens is distinctly regulated by unique and/or common factors. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanisms controlling the transcription of the human fra-1 gene by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in HBE cells. We found that fra-1 induction is regulated through a complex regulatory process, in which cooperation between proteins binding to multiple cis-elements appears to be critical. Gene Expression Analyses—A549, a human alveolar type II-like epithelial cell line, was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For Northern blot analyses, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with various inducers as indicated. Total RNA (15 μg/lane) was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNAs of fra-1 and 18 S rRNA as previously described (17Patterson T. Vuong H. Y-S. L. Wu R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Vuong H. Patterson T. Adiseshaiah P. Shapiro P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed to detect specific mRNAs as described previously (17Patterson T. Vuong H. Y-S. L. Wu R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Vuong H. Patterson T. Adiseshaiah P. Shapiro P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA (750 ng) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and PCR was performed using human fra-1 (forward, 5′-GGGCATGTTCCGAGACTTCG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCACAAAGCGAGGAGGGTTG-3′) and β-actin gene-specific primer pairs (forward, 5′-GAGAAAATCTGGCACCACAAC-3′; reverse, 5′-TACCCCTCGTAGATGGGCAC-3′). The number of cycles was empirically optimized to amplify the products in a linear range (17Patterson T. Vuong H. Y-S. L. Wu R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Vuong H. Patterson T. Adiseshaiah P. Shapiro P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses, total protein was extracted using a kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). A comparable quantity of protein from each sample was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then probed with specific polyclonal antibodies and developed using ECL-Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Cells (∼107) were stimulated with appropriate agents, and ChIP was performed using a commercially available kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Chromatin was cross-linked by adding formaldehyde to the tissue culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and incubating the mixture for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and suspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, with 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture). Samples were sonicated on ice to an average length of 500–1000 bp and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm. Solubilized chromatin was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, with 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, and 167 mm NaCl) and used for ChIP assays. A fraction of the soluble chromatin (1%) was saved for total chromatin input. Chromatin was precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 30 min and then incubated with specific antibodies for 18 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated products were washed, and DNA was eluted. DNA from the immunoprecipitated products was extracted after proteinase K digestion and used for PCR (40 cycles) with fra-1 promoter-specific primers: –379 F (5′-GCGGAGCTCGCAGAAACGGAGG-3′) and –220 R (5′-GGCGCTAGCCCCCTGACGTAGCTGCCCAT-3′). These primers generate a 160-bp DNA product. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The 5′-flanking region of human fra-1 (–861 to +32 bp) was amplified with Pfu DNA polymerase using the genomic DNA isolated from HBE-1, a nontumorigenic human bronchial epithelial cell line, as a template. The resulting product was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter gene between the SacI and NheI sites of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). Various mutants were generated using PCR and verified by DNA sequencing. pCMV expression vectors bearing the wild-type and dominant negative (mutations in the transactivation domain) c-jun were generously provided by Michael Birrer (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). jun-B and jun-D cloned in the SR-α vector were obtained from Michael Karin (University of California at San Diego). pCMV-c-fos and pCMV-fos-B, pCMV-fra-1, and pCMV-fra-2 were obtained from R. Dobner (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA), Eugene Tulchinsky (Institute of Cancer Biology), and Donna Cohen (Australian National University), respectively. Transfections and Reporter Gene Analyses—To generate stable transfectants, A549 cells were transfected with 100 ng of reporter construct along with 5 ng of pCI-Neo vector. Stable clones were isolated after selection with G418 (400 μg/ml). Transient transfection was performed as described in our earlier publications (17Patterson T. Vuong H. Y-S. L. Wu R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Vuong H. Patterson T. Adiseshaiah P. Shapiro P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 100 ng of reporter construct, 1 ng of Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK; Promega), and 25–200 ng of empty or expression plasmids. After 18–24 h, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with either vehicle (Me2SO) or TPA (100 ng/ml) for 5 h. Cell extracts were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using a dual luciferase kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to that of Renilla luciferase (17Patterson T. Vuong H. Y-S. L. Wu R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Vuong H. Patterson T. Adiseshaiah P. Shapiro P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least 3–4 times in triplicate. Data are presented as the mean luciferase activity ± S.E. The statistical significance of the differences between groups was determined using a Student's t test. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Serum-starved A549 cells were treated with TPA for 90 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared (23Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed in a 20-μl reaction volume using optimal binding conditions for AP1 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA), Sp1 (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, with 25 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 500 μm EDTA, 500 μm ZnCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA), and ETS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, with 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) proteins (24Sark M.W. Fischer D.F. de Meijer E. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24683-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (2–3 μg) were incubated with the binding buffers on ice for 10 min before the addition of 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide probes. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, samples were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 2% glycerol. To determine the specificity of complex formation, nuclear extracts were incubated for 10–15 min with a25–100-fold molar excess of wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides prior to the addition of labeled probes. To demonstrate the presence of a specific protein in a complex, nuclear extracts were preincubated on ice with 1–2 μg of specific antibodies (c-Jun (sc-45X), Jun-B (sc-46X), Jun-D (sc-74X), c-Fos (sc-7202X), Fra-1 (sc-605X), Fra-2 (sc-604X), Ets-1/2 (sc-112X), EGR1 (sc-189X), Sp1 (sc-59X), or Sp3 (sc-644X), all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1–2 h before incubating with the labeled DNA probe. Toxicant-induced Expression of fra-1 in HBE Cells—To understand the regulation of human fra-1 expression, A549 cells were exposed to TPA (100 ng/ml), EGF (50 ng/ml), H2O2 (200 μm), and lipopolysaccharide (10 μg/ml). RNA was isolated, and Northern blot analysis was performed using a 32P-labeled human fra-1 cDNA probe. As shown in Fig. 1A, TPA induced a strongly enhanced level of fra-1 mRNA expression (lanes 8–14) as early as 30 min after initial exposure, peaked at 3 h, and remained elevated thereafter. The two alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts of fra-1 (3.3 and 1.7 kb) (19Matsui M. Tokuhara M. Konuma Y. Nomura N. Ishizaki R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 249-255PubMed Google Scholar) were similarly induced. Although fra-1 mRNA was transiently induced by H2O2 (90 min), it was undetectable at 6 h after stimulation. In contrast to TPA and H2O2, lipopolysaccharide did not have an appreciable effect on fra-1 expression when evaluated for 180 min, with the exception of a modest induction of the smaller RNA species (1.7 kb) after 6 h (lanes 1–7). As shown in Fig. 1B, EGF caused an increase in fra-1 message levels as early as 30 min after initial treatment. Message levels peaked at 120 min and remained above the basal level for 14 h. The induction of fra-1 mRNA expression by TPA or EGF also correlated with a corresponding increases in its protein levels (Fig. 1C) and DNA binding (data not shown). A similar pattern of fra-1 induction by TPA or EGF was observed in two other HBE cell lines, HBE1 and H441 (data not shown). The differential patterns of fra-1 induction by H2O2 (an oxidant), TPA, and EGF suggest a stimulus-specific regulation of fra-1 expression in HBE cells. Studies using actinomycin D and cycloheximide indicated that TPA-, H2O2-, and EGF-inducible expression of fra-1 was mainly regulated at the transcriptional level and did not require de novo protein synthesis (data not shown). These observations are consistent with the reported regulation of other AP1 genes in different cell types (1Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar, 25Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 26Bergers G. Graninger P. Braselmann S. Wrighton C. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3748-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Mapping of the fra-1 Promoter Required for TPA-inducible Transcription—To further elucidate the mechanisms controlling the inducible expression of fra-1 by TPA, we generated luciferase reporter constructs bearing various portions of the 5′-flanking region of human fra-1. Fig. 2A shows these constructs and the positions of the various putative cis-elements. These reporters were transfected into A549 cells, and luciferase activities were monitored. When compared with 68-Luc (which displayed a promoter activity no greater than pGL3 basic vector), the 105-Luc reporter had a slightly higher (>30%) luciferase expression (Fig. 2B). This observation indicates that the DNA sequences between –105 and +32 probably contain the minimal fra-1 promoter region. Compared with 105-Luc, 466-Luc, and 861-Luc, the 283-Luc construct had an ∼4-fold higher basal activity, suggesting that the region between –283 and –105 bp contains sites responsible for the basal expression of fra-1. As shown in Fig. 2B, cells transfected with the 68-Luc and 105-Luc constructs showed no appreciable change in luciferase activity following TPA treatment. The 283-Luc construct had displayed a 2–4-fold higher luciferase activity in response to TPA. However, an increase of nearly 20–30-fold in TPA-inducible promoter activity was noticed with the 466-Luc, 570-Luc, and 605-Luc constructs. Although TPA markedly stimulated 659-Luc and 861-Luc (∼10–15-fold increase), the induction was not as dramatic as that observed for 466-Luc, 570-Luc, and 605-Luc. Taken together, these results suggest that the regions between –105 and +32, –283 and –105, and –466 and –283 contain necessary cis-elements for directing minimal, basal, and TPA-inducible expression of fra-1, respectively. To better define the coordinates of the TPA inducible cis-elements, additional deletion mutants were generated and used in transfection analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C, cells transfected with 379-Luc showed a high level of luciferase activity in response to TPA, as compared with other constructs. Although 328-Luc showed a 10-fold greater stimulation than did 283-Luc and was nearly comparable with that of 466-Luc, the magnitude of the induction was half of that observed for 379-Luc. This result indicates that the –379/–283 region contains elements necessary for directing high level TPA-inducible fra-1 transcription. Similar results were obtained in other HBE lines, H441 and HBE1 (data not shown). Therefore, we focused the rest of our studies on this region. Multiple cis-Elements within the –379/–283 Region of the fra-1 Promoter Respond to TPA—The –379/–283 region harbors several putative cis-acting elements, including an Ets-like binding site (EBS), a GC box (also known as an Sp1 binding site), and a TRE (see Fig. 3A). To assess the contribution of these motifs to TPA-inducible fra-1 promoter activity, we introduced mutations into these sites. Mutations in any of the individual cis-elements markedly reduced (∼50–80%) the basal level expression of the reporter (Fig. 3B). In particular, mutations in either of these sites profoundly reduced the TPA-inducible fra-1 promoter activity. Because of its profound inhibitory effect on transcription, we infer that the TRE at –318 is essential for transcriptional regulation of fra-1 in both the unstimulated and stimulated state. Analysis of Transcription Factors Binding to the –379/–283 Fragment in HBE Cells—Since mutations in the –379/–283 region ablated promoter activity, we used EMSAs to determine whether this region bound to specific transacting factors. When incubated with the A549 nuclear extracts, the –379/–283 bp fragment formed three major protein complexes, designated I, II, and III. The formation of these complexes was strongly enhanced by TPA treatment (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 2). The specificity of formation of these complexes was determined using competition assays with unlabeled oligonucleotides bearing consensus TRE, EBS, and GC box sequences (see Fig. 5A). Each of these oligonucleotides selectively inhibited the formation of specific protein-DNA complexes with the –379/–283 fragment. Interestingly, the unlabeled TRE probe not only completely blocked the formation of complex I but also significantly diminished the binding intensity of complexes II and III (lanes 3 and 4). A similar effect on complex I was observed with the EBS and GC box oligonucleotides (lanes 5–8), which strongly reduced the formation of complexes II and III. In contrast to the individual oligonucleotides, the unlabeled –379/–283 fragment (self, lane 9) blocked the formation of all three complexes. These observations suggest the formation of multi-protein complexes with the –379/–283 region.Fig. 5The nature of transcription factors complexes formed with the functional elements of the fra-1 promoter.A, DNA sequences of the oligonucleotide probes used for EMSA analysis. The sequence of only the upper strand is shown in each case. cEBS, consensus EBS. EMSA was performed with two different batches of nuclear extracts, and similar results were obtained in both cases. Different binding buffers (see“Experimental Procedures”) were used for detecting ETS and Sp1 complexes. B, the –318 TREwt and –318 TREmt probes were incubated with nuclear extracts as in Fig. 4.

https://openalex.org/W2018914741,"The Toll/interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor family plays an important role in both innate and adaptive immunity. These receptors are characterized by a C-terminal homology motif called the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. A principal function of the TIR domain is mediating homotypic protein-protein interactions in the signal transduction pathway. To suggest interaction sites of TIR domains in the IL-1 receptor complex, we modeled the putative three-dimensional structure of the TIR domain within the co-receptor chain, IL-1 receptor accessory protein. The model was based on homology with the crystal structures of human TLR1 and TLR2. The final structure of the IL-1 receptor accessory protein TIR domain suggests the conserved regions box 1 and 2, including Pro-446, as well as box 3 within the C-terminal α-helix as possible protein-protein interaction sites due to their exposure and their electrostatic potential. Pro-446, corresponding to the Pro/His mutation in dominant negative TLR4, is located in the third loop at the outmost edge of the TIR domain and does not play any structural role. Inhibition of IL-1 responsiveness seen after substitution of Pro-446 by charged amino acids is due to the loss of an interaction site for other TIR domains. Amino acids 527–534 as part of the loop close to the conserved box 3 are critical for recruitment of myeloid differentiation factor 88 and to a lesser extent for IL-1 responsiveness. Modeling suggests that native folding of the TIR domain may be approached by the responsive deletion mutants Δ528–534 and Δ527–533, whereas the C-terminal β-strand and/or α-helix is displaced in the nonresponsive mutant Δ527–534.

The effects of IL-1 are mediated via the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) (3.Heguy A. Baldari C. Bush K. Nagele R. Newton R.C. Robb R.J. Horuk R. Telford J.L. Melli M. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 311-315PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding to its receptor, IL-1 induces multiple physiological responses and the expression of a large number of proinflammatory enzymes such as acute phase proteins, adhesion molecules, tissue-degrading enzymes, and inducible cyclooxygenase (for a review, see Ref. 4O'Neill, L. A. (2000) Sci. STKE, http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/44/re1Google Scholar). Three ligands are known to bind to IL-1RI: IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1Ra, the latter acting as a true receptor antagonist. The IL-1RI complex consists of two type I integral membrane proteins: IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP (5.Sims J.E. March C.J. Cosman D. Widmer M.B. MacDonald H.R. McMahan C.J. Grubin C.E. Wignall J.M.

Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar); both are preassociated with the regulatory protein Tollip (20.Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), whereas IRAK-4 functions as a central element in the early signal transduction of Toll/IL-1 receptors upstream of IRAK-1 (11.Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the cytosolic adapter molecule MyD88 associates with the TIR domains of receptor and co-receptor (12.Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 21.Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z.

French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), and thus introduces death domains into the active receptor complex. Upon activation, IRAK is phosphorylated weakening its affinity for Tollip in favor of interaction with MyD88 (23Dunne, A., and O'Neill, L. A. (2003) Sci. STKE, http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2003/171/re3,Google Scholar). After further phosphorylation, the MyD88·IRAK complex is disrupted. The free cytosolic IRAK interacts with tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6) (24.Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). IL-1 stimulates the membrane-cytosol translocation of the TAK-1-binding protein TAB-2, which functionally links TAK-1 to TRAF-6 (25.Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). TRAF-6 is the upstream regulator of TAK-1 (26.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) thereby coupling IL-1RI to activation of NF-κB (27.Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, a minor part of the IL-1-dependent NF-κB activation is independent of IRAK and uses an alternative pathway involving the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (28.Guo F. Wu S. Inflammation. 2000; 24: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) to a distinct site within the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-1 receptor complex (29.Auron P.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Signal transduction is also mediated via additional signaling cascades such as the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways (26.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K.

IL-1RI has been identified as part of the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) superfamily whose members encode various receptors involved in inflammation and host defense (23Dunne, A., and O'Neill, L. A. (2003) Sci. STKE, http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2003/171/re3,Google Scholar, 32.Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys.

Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These receptors share a conserved cytoplasmic motif consisting of about 150–180 amino acids, the TIR domain, named due to the sequence similarity between IL-1RI and the D. melanogaster protein Toll (34.Gay N.J. Keith F.J. Nature. 1991; 351: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Within the TIR domain three typical regions of conservation can be found called box 1, 2, and 3 (35.Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). A principal function of TIR domains is thought to be mediating homotypic protein-protein interactions in the signal transduction pathway (36.Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular basis of TIR domain signaling, we derived a homology model of the three-dimensional structure of the IL-1RAcP TIR domain based on crystal structures of the human Toll-like receptors TLR1 and TLR2 (37.Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The model suggests at least two conserved regions, 1) box 1 and 2, including Pro-446 in place of the Pro/His mutation in dominant negative TLR4 and 2) box 3 within the C-terminal α-helix, as putative interaction sites for downstream adapter molecules due to their exposure and their electrostatic potential. Structural considerations and functional analyses of mutants suggested aa 527–534, which form the loop preceding box 3, as being critical for MyD88 recruitment and, to a lesser extent, for IL-1 responsiveness. Cell Culture and Biological Reagents—Mouse thymoma EL4D6/76 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (PAN Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany) containing 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 30 μm 2-mercapthoethanol (culture medium) at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. For stimulation, 2 × 105 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Human (h) recombinant (r) IL-1α (rhIL-1α) and mouse (m) recombinant (r) IL-18 (rmIL-18) were purchased from PAN Biotech GmbH, whereas PMA was purchased from Sigma. Human embryonic kidney cells 293IL-1RI stably expressing human IL-1RI (18.Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) were cultured and stimulated in Dulbecco's modified essential medium high glucose (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under the conditions indicated above. Construction of Mutated Forms of IL-1RAcP—Mutated forms of IL-1RAcP were constructed by PCR technique. Deletions in the IL-1RAcP sequence were performed with the ExSite™ PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), whereas point mutations and multiple amino acid exchanges were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To generate multiple mutations within IL-1RAcP, random mutagenesis was performed using degenerated primers as follows: 5′-CAC GGT CAT TAA ATG GA(C/T) AA(A/G) A(C/T)A GA(C/T) A(A/G)(A/T) CA(C/T) A(G/C)A T(G/C)(A/G) TCA GGG CAG GTT CTG G-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCA GAA CCT GCC CTG A(C/T)(G/C) AT(G/C) TAT G(A/T)(C/T) T(A/G)T CT(A/G) T(C/T)T T(A/G)T CCT TTT AAT GAC CGT G-3′ (reverse primer). The vector pFLAG-IL-1RAcP, a derivative of pFLAG-CMV-1 (Sigma) was used as a template in all mutagenesis experiments. All mutations were verified by sequence analysis. Transient Transfection of EL4D6/76 and 293IL-1RI Cells— EL4D6/76 cells, lacking IL-1RAcP expression (9.Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Wesche H. Falk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), at a density of ≤5 × 105/ml were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method. Briefly, the transfection reagent was freshly prepared by mixing 300 μl of 0.5 mg/ml DEAE-dextran in TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 123 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4) and 300 μl of chloroquine (80 μg/ml in TBS) containing 500 ng of IL-1RAcP expression plasmid encoding the various mutated forms of the co-receptor chain together with 1 μg of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the IL-1-inducible proximal region of the murine IL-2 promoter (pGL3-IL-2(-303)) (38.Stricker K. Serfling E. Krammer P.H. Falk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1475-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 39.Radons J. Gabler S. Wesche H. Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Falk W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16456-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 cells (in logarithmic growth phase) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 and resuspended in TBS. After centrifugation the supernatant was decanted, and the cells were resuspended in the residual liquid. Subsequently the DEAE-dextran-DNA transfection mixture was added, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Afterward cells were washed twice with phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium (PAN Biotech GmbH) plus supplements and cultured for 24 h in 6-well plates (Costar) at a density of 106 cells/ml. 293IL-1RI cells were co-transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with different amounts of pFLAG-IL-1RAcP encoding N-terminally FLAG-tagged mouse wt or mutant co-receptor chain in combination with either pTollip-noTag encoding untagged human Tollip or pRK7-Myc/MyD88 (a kind gift from H. Wesche, Tularik, South San Francisco, CA) encoding human MyD88 fused to an N-terminal Myc tag. The total amount of DNA in all transfections was kept constant by adding empty vector DNA. Reporter Gene Assay and Determination of IL-2 Secretion—The transfectants were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 106/ml and co-stimulated with either 20 units/ml rhIL-1α or 250 ng/ml rmIL-18 in the presence of 10 ng/ml PMA for 18 h or remained unstimulated. IL-2 promotor activation was determined by measuring the luciferase activity in transiently transfected cells using the LucLite Plus luciferase reporter gene assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (39.Radons J. Gabler S. Wesche H. Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Falk W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16456-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to the IL-1R complex-independent IL-18 response obtained after co-incubation of the transfectants in the presence of PMA + IL-18. IL-2 secretion into the culture supernatants was quantified by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described elsewhere (39.Radons J. Gabler S. Wesche H. Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Falk W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16456-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—40 h after transfection, 293IL-1RI cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml rhIL-1β (a kind gift from D. Boraschi, Dompé SpA, L'Aquila, Italy) for 5 min and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20 min, 15,000 × g, 4 °C) and incubated under agitation with anti-FLAG M2-Sepharose (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were thoroughly washed with lysis buffer and heated for 10 min at 95 °C in Laemmli buffer (40.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Solubilized proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Specific proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce) using anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Tollip (Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Swizerland) antibodies. Computational Methods—An initial computer model of the mouse IL-1RAcP TIR domain was generated by the program COMPOSER (41.Blundell T. Carney D. Gardner S. Hayes F. Howlin B. Hubbard T. Overington J. Singh D.A. Sibanda B.L. Sutcliffe M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) as part of the molecular modeling package SYBYL 6.9 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). Three crystal structures from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank were selected as templates by overall sequence identity: human TLR1 (1fyv), TLR2 (1fyw), and the TLR2 P681H mutant (1fyx) (37.Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Based on optimal sequence alignments, the structurally conserved regions (SCRs, Fig. 1) and an average Cα framework structure of the template SCRs were determined by an iterative approach, improving both the multiple alignment and the subsequent SCR framework by pairwise Needleman and Wunsch dynamic programming procedures with a similarity matrix constructed from inter-Cα distances. The backbone of each SCR of the IL-1RAcP TIR domain was then built by fitting the corresponding SCR from one of the known homologs (namely that with the highest block sequence identity, mostly TLR1) to the appropriate region of the framework. The least-squares fits are inversely weighted by the variation of the residue positions across the known structures. This approach provides a sufficient degree of diversity on constructing the SCRs of the model and avoids an arbitrary focus on one of the templates. Side chains of the model were added by a knowledge-based approach, taking in account the backbone secondary structure and the side chain conformation at the corresponding residues of the templates. The structurally variable regions of the model were constructed by the loop search algorithm within SYBYL. For each structurally variable region, appropriate fragments from a binary Protein Data Bank with the same length as the structurally variable region of the target are proposed on the base of distances and superpositions of the anchor residues. After adding hydrogens, the models were roughly energy-minimized usingthe Kollman force field (42.Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar) with Kollman all-atom charges (distance-dependent dielectricity constant, 4; ∼500 cycles; first 50 cycles with constrained backbone; steepest descent method) and finally optimized up to a root mean square (r.m.s.) gradient of 0.05 kcal/mol × Å (Powell conjugate gradient). Surfaces and electrostatic potentials of the model were calculated and visualized by the program MOLCAD implied in SYBYL 6.9. Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences between mean values were analyzed using the two-sided Student's t test. A homology model of the putative three-dimensional structure of the TIR domain within IL-1RAcP was generated starting from three Protein Data Bank crystal structures of human TLR1 (1fyv), TLR2 (1fyw), and the TLR2 P681H mutant (1fyx) (37.Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and from multiple alignments of the primary and secondary structure elements of mouse IL-1RAcP and several members of the Toll/IL-1 receptor family. The alignment of IL-1RAcP with TLR1 and TLR2 generated by the program COMPOSER as base for model construction is presented in Fig. 1. In general, the structurally conserved regions SCR1–SCR8 contain the six α-helices αA, αB, αC, αC′, αD, and αE and the five β-strands βA, βB, βC, βD, and βE but additionally parts of the loops AA, BB, and DD and the turn BC. The identity scores of IL-1RAcP with TLR1 (28.2%) and TLR2 (25%) are at the lower limit for application of homology modeling approaches, but within the SCRs identical and conservatively mutated aa together amount to 50.5% (IL-1RAcP versus TLR1) and 49.5% (IL-1RAcP versus TLR2). The long loops BB and CD were selected and inserted by COMPOSER from one of the TIR domain templates (1fyv). The energy-minimized model of IL-1RAcP is shown in Fig. 2A. Due to the homology modeling approach, its domain structure closely resembles that of the templates. The r.m.s. distances of the Cα atoms of the SCRs amount to 1.11, 1.26, and 1.25 Å comparing the IL-1RAcP model with 1fyv, 1fyw, and 1fyx, respectively. The TIR domain structure of IL-1RAcP is predicted to contain a central multiple β-sheet that is surrounded by six α-helices. The disulfide bridge between the cysteines 667 and 686 in TLR1 is neither present in TLR2 nor in IL-1RAcP. The conserved region box 1, mainly consisting of βA, and box 2, including βB and nearly the complete loop BB, are adjacent in space and present most of their side chains for interaction with adapter molecules (37.Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (see surface representation, Fig. 2B, and electrostatic potential, Fig. 2C). Box 2 contains a highly conserved proline residue at position 446 farthest away from the rest of the TIR domain. The identical course of the BB loop in the crystal structures of TLR2 and its P681H mutant (r.m.s. of Cα atoms, 0.27 Å) suggests that this proline does not play any structural role. The BB loops of TLR1 and TLR2 are similar too as indicated by an r.m.s. deviation of 0.97 Å, which is low compared with the overall r.m.s. distance of both TIR domains (2.34 Å). The C-terminal homology motif box 3 as part of αE, possibly together with loop EE, represents a second region for potential recruitment of downstream adapter molecules (Fig. 2, A–C). The eight-amino acid stretch between Lys-527 and Pro-534 (nearly the complete loop EE) was recently shown to be critical for IL-1 responsiveness (39.Radons J. Gabler S. Wesche H. Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Falk W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16456-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In particular, the correct position of helix αE including box 3 seems to be of importance since deletion mutants like Δ527–533 and Δ528–534, enabling the same packing of αE as in the wild type, are fully responsive (Fig. 2D, for more details see “Discussion”). To verify our hypotheses, we analyzed a possible contribution of the conserved Pro-446 as well as the neighboring Gly-447 to IL-1 signaling. For this purpose, Pro-446 and Gly-447 within IL-1RAcP were mutated as indicated in Figs. 3 and 4. To test the functionality of the IL-1RAcP mutants, EL4D6/76 cells lacking the expression of IL-1RAcP (9.Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Wesche H. Falk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected with these constructs, and IL-1-induced signal transduction was investigated in the transfectants using the co-transfected luciferase reporter pGL3-IL-2(-303). We have shown previously that IL-1 acts on the IL-2 promoter by activating the T cell element distal (TCEd) via the IL-1 receptor and mitogens (38.Stricker K. Serfling E. Krammer P.H. Falk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1475-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, stimulation of the transfectants was performed as co-incubation with PMA and cytokine. Afterward luciferase activity was determined as an indicator for IL-2 promoter activation, and IL-2 production was measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-18 was used as an internal control leading to activation of the IL-2 promoter and IL-2 production independent of the IL-1 receptor complex. The IL-18 response remained unaffected in all experiments indicating that the cells were completely functional. Data were normalized with respect to the IL-1R complex-independent IL-18 response obtained after co-incubation of the transfectants in the presence of PMA + IL-18 and expressed as ratio of the IL-1 and IL-18 response. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, mutation of Pro-446 → Ala did not affect both IL-1-specific effects, IL-2 promoter activation and IL-2 production. Moreover mutation of Pro-446 → Leu had no effect on IL-1 responsiveness (data not shown). In contrast, mutation of Pro-446 → His or Pro-446 → Asp resulted in a dramatic decrease of both IL-1-mediated responses (Fig. 3). The same observation was made after mutation of Pro-446 → Arg and Pro-446 → Glu, which reduced IL-1 responsiveness to a comparable extent (not shown). Furthermore the results obtained after mutation of either Gly-447 → Glu or Gly-447 → Ala confirmed our results on the effect of mutations of Pro-446 indicating that only substitution by polar aa residues affects IL-1 responsiveness (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effect of mutations of Gly-447 within IL-1RAcP on IL-1-induced IL-2 promoter activation and IL-2 secretion.

https://openalex.org/W2068755907,"Induction of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in chromosomal DNA is considered a major reason for the antiproliferative effect of psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). It is unclear as to whether PUVA-induced cell cycle arrest is caused by ICLs mechanically stalling replication forks or by triggering cell cycle checkpoints. Cell cycle checkpoints serve to maintain genomic stability by halting cell cycle progression to prevent replication of damaged DNA templates or segregation of broken chromosomes. Here, we show that HaCaT keratinocytes treated with PUVA arrest with S-phase DNA content. Cells that had completed DNA replication were not perturbed by PUVA and passed through mitosis. Cells treated with PUVA during G1-phase continued traversing G1 until arresting in early S-phase. PUVA induced rapid phosphorylation of the Chk1 checkpoint kinase at Ser345 and a concomitant decrease in Cdc25A levels. Chk1 phosphorylation, decrease of Cdc25 A levels and S-phase arrest were abolished by caffeine, demonstrating that active checkpoint signaling rather than passive mechanical blockage by ICLs causes the PUVA-induced replication arrest. Overexpression of Cdc25A only partially overrode the S-phase arrest, suggesting that additional signaling events implement PUVA-induced S-phase arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2024284074,"It has been shown that Fis activates transcription of the ribosomal promoter rrnB P1; however, the mechanism by which Fis activates rrnB P1 transcription is not fully understood. Paradoxically, although Fis activates transcription of rrnB P1 in vitro, transcription from the promoter containing Fis sites (as measured from rrnB P1-lacZ fusions) is not reduced in a fis null mutant strain. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism by which Fis activates transcription of the rrnB P1 promoter and the role of Fis in rRNA synthesis and cell growth in Escherichia coli. Like all other stringent promoters investigated so far, open complex of rrnB P1 has been shown to be intrinsically unstable, making open complex stability a potential regulatory step in transcription of this class of promoters. Our results show that Fis acts at this regulatory step by stabilizing the interaction between RNA polymerase and rrnB P1 in the absence of NTPs. Mutational analysis of the Fis protein demonstrates that there is a complete correlation between Fis-mediated transcriptional activation of rrnB P1 and Fis-mediated stabilization of preinitiation complexes of the promoter. Thus, our study indicates that Fis-mediated stabilization of RNA polymerase-rrnB P1 preinitiation complexes, presumably at the open complex step, contributes prominently to transcriptional activation. Furthermore, our in vivo results show that rRNA synthesis from the P1 promoters of several rRNA operons are reduced 2-fold in a fis null mutant compared with the wild type strain, indicating that Fis plays an important role in the establishment of robust rRNA synthesis when E. coli cells are emerging from a growth-arrested phase to a rapid growth phase.

Thus, our results resolve an apparent paradox of the role of Fis in vitro and in vivo in the field. In nutrient-rich media, most RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviation used is: ! RNAPRNA polymerase. molecules inside rapidly dividing Escherichia coli cells are engaged in transcription of a small set of genes in the genome, whose products, such as rRNA and tRNA, are primarily involved in translation (1Ingraham J.L. Maalfe O. Neidhardt F.C. Growth of the Bacterial Cell. Sinauer, Sundeerland, MA1983Google Scholar, 2Nomura M. Gourse R. Baughman G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 75-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). However, when cells are shifted from nutrient-rich to nutrient starvation conditions, the cellular transcription machinery is reprogrammed to respond to the environmental cue, a process called the stringent response (for a review, see Ref. 3Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). One of the most dramatic effects of the stringent response is to “turn off” the expression of those genes that are most active in nutrient-rich conditions; thus, those genes are stringently regulated, and the promoters from these genes are called stringent promoters. RNA polymerase. We and others have shown that one unique feature shared by all stringent promoters tested is that the interactions between RNAP and stringent promoters are intrinsically unstable (4Gourse R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9789-9809Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 5Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Preinitiation complexes of stringent promoters are unstable because the steps prior to the first phosphodiester bond formation are reversible, with the intermediate closed and open complexes being in rapid equilibrium. The intrinsically unstable preinitiation complexes of stringent promoters probably represent the isomerized open complex that is competent for RNA synthesis. Formation of the first phosphodiester bond results in an initially transcribing complex, which becomes very stable. Contrary to stringent promoters, open preinitiation complexes at nonstringent promoters are generally very stable, and backward reactions to closed complexes are negligible (6McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that several rifampicin-resistant RNAPs, purified from the rpoB mutants that exhibited the stringent response phenotype even in rich media (thus, they are called stringent RNAPs), further destabilize preinitiation complexes with the stringent promoters tested when compared with wild type RNAP (5Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 7Jin D.J. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). As expected, all of these rpoB mutations confer a slow growth phenotype (∼50% of growth rate of wild type cells in rich media), and total RNA synthesis is reduced in these stringent RNAP mutants compared with wild type strain (8Jin D.J. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5229-5231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4292-4298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other RNAP mutants that exhibited partial stringent response phenotypes have also been studied with similar results (10Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Taken together, we and others proposed that a potential regulatory step in transcription of stringent promoters is at the interaction between RNAP and the promoter, presumably at the stability of the open complex, and hence factors that act at this regulatory step would modulate transcription of stringent promoters and the stringent (nutrient starvation) response (5Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 10Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The rrnB P1 promoter is one of the best studied stringent promoters in E. coli (for a review, see Ref. 11Gourse R.L. Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Appleman J.A. Ross W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 645-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Because the sequences of the promoters/regulatory regions are conserved in all of the seven rRNA operons (12Condon C. Philips J. Fu Z.Y. Squires C. Squires C.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4175-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it is likely that the rrnB P1 is representative of the P1 promoters of all rRNA operons. There are multiple elements (both cis and trans) that contribute to the strength and the regulation of rrnB P1 (13Gourse R.L. de Boer H.A. Nomura M.

Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Fis is a nucleoid-associated and site-specific DNA-binding protein that plays an important role in gene expression and site-specific DNA recombination (20Finkel S.E. Johnson R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3257-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21McLeod S.M. Johnson R.C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The expression of fis is subject to growth phase regulation, with its peak expression around the first doubling time after overnight cultures are diluted into a fresh rich medium; thus, the cellular level of Fis is highest at the very early log phase and lowest at the stationary phase (22Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ali Azam T. Iwata A. Nishimura A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fis exists as a dimer in solution, and its crystal structure is known (24Kostrewa D. Granzin J. Koch C. Choe H.W. Raghunathan S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6860-6873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analyses indicate that the domains in Fis that are important for its different functions are distinct (27Osuna R. Finkel S.E. Johnson R.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Koch C. Ninnemann O. Fuss H. Kahmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5915-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For example, the “activation patch” of Fis, responsible for transcriptional activation of several promoters including rrnB P1, is located in residues Gln68, Arg71, Gly72, and Gln74, within and flanking the β-turn connecting helices B and C adjacent to the C-terminal helix-turnhelix DNA binding motif (29Gosink K.K.

Biol. 1999; 294: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas residues near the N terminus (Val16, Asp20, and Val22) are critical for the DNA inversion activity (26Safo M.K. Yang W.Z. Corselli L. Cramton S.E. Yuan H.S. Johnson R.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6860-6873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Osuna R. Finkel S.E. Johnson R.C.

Although there are three Fis binding sites in rrnB P1, most activation by Fis is attributable to site I of the promoter, where Fis interacts with the C-terminal domain of the α subunit of RNAP (15Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 30Bokal A.J. Ross W. Gaal T. Johnson R.C. Gourse R.L.

Biol. 2002; 316: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, some other rrn promoters, such as rrnA P1, require all three Fis binding sites for effective activation (34Rochman M. Aviv M. Glaser G. Muskhelishvili G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35Hirvonen C.A. Ross W. Wozniak C.E. Marasco E. Anthony J.R. Aiyar S.E. Newburn V.H. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6305-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the activation of rrnB P1 by Fis has not been fully elucidated, although much is known about the interactions between RNAP and Fis at the ribosomal promoter (30Bokal A.J. Ross W. Gaal T. Johnson R.C. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36Bokal A.J. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, although Fis activates transcription of rrnB P1 in vitro, transcription from the promoter containing Fis sites (as measured from rrnB P1-lacZ fusions) is not reduced in a fis null mutant strain (15Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 37Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, the effects of the fis mutations on cell growth are inconsistent and often negligible compared with wild type cells (15Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 37Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To account for the apparent contradictions between the in vitro and in vivo results by Fis, a feedback mechanism was proposed for the regulation of rrnB P1 (15Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 37Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mode of action by Fis on the transcriptional activation of rrnB P1. We demonstrated that Fis stabilizes the interaction between RNAP and the rrnB P1 promoter, probably at the step of open preinitiation complexes in the absence of NTPs, thus leading to enhanced transcription. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that Fis plays an important role in establishing robust rRNA synthesis when cells emerge from an arrested state in stationary phase to a rapid growing state in early log phase. Chemicals and Reagents—Nucleotides, [α-32P]UTP, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Glutamic acid, potassium glutamate, and heparin were from Sigma. Magnesium glutamate was from Fluka. Plasmid pRLG1617 containing the rrnB P1 promoter (-88 to +1) and rrnB T1T2 terminators was kindly provided by Wilma Ross and Richard Gourse (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and described (5Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Plasmid pDJ4335, a derivative of pRLG1617, contains a mutant rrnB P1 promoter in which all the G/C in the discriminator sequence upstream of +1 was changed into A/T by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. The DNA sequences of the two primers for the amplification of the rrnB P1 DNA (-88 to +1) and introduction of the discriminator mutations were 5′-CGGAATTCAGGCTGATTTGGTTGAAT (upper strand) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTAATTAATAATTATAGGGAGTTAT (lower strand). The lower strand primer has mutations in the discriminator region (underlined in the above sequences). PCR was performed using pRLG1617 DNA as template. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and then inserted into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pRLG1617 to replace the wild type rrnB P1 sequence. The plasmid supercoiled DNA was purified with a Qiagen plasmid purification kit. RNAPs were purified as described (39Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The stringent RNAPs (RpoB114, RpoB3770, and RpoB3449) were described (5Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant Fis proteins used in this study were overproduced and purified as described elsewhere (30Bokal A.J.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1972Google Scholar). The E. coli strains used were K12 MG1655 (laboratory collection from Carol Gross, University of California, San Francisco) and its derivatives. The fis null mutant strains were constructed by phage P1 transduction with a lysate made from strain RLG1351 (MG1655 Δ lacX74/λ rrnB P1 fis::kan (5Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The latter contained 20 mm Tris-glutamate (pH 8.0), 10 mm magnesium glutamate, and 200 mm or indicated concentrations of potassium glutamate. The concentrations of supercoiled plasmid and RNAPs were 4–5 and 2–4 nm, respectively. Each of the Fis proteins (wild type and the mutants) was titrated, and the concentration (usually ∼150 nm) that gave maximal activation of the rrnB P1 effect was used in the reactions as indicated. The reaction mixtures were preincubated for 15 min, and reactions were initiated by the addition of NTPs (0.2 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP and 0.02 mm UTP including 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP). When indicated, heparin (10 μg/ml for KCl and 100 μg/ml for potassium glutamate) was added with NTPs at the same time. After 10 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA 0.1% bromphenol, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) and analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel (National Diagnostics). The signals were visualized and quantified using PhosphorImager equipment (STORM 680; Amersham Biosciences). Determination of the Kinetics of Inactivation of Preinitiation Complexes at rrnB P1 by the DNA Competitor Heparin—Conditions were the same as described above for in vitro transcription with the following modifications. After preincubation of RNAP, Fis protein as indicated, and DNA template for 15 min, heparin was added into reactions at time 0. Aliquots were taken and mixed with NTPs at specified time intervals after the addition of inhibitor. The transcription reactions were allowed to continue for another 10 min before being terminated and analyzed as described above. The data were analyzed, and half-lives were calculated. To ensure consistency in the measurement of half-lives of preinitiation complexes in the presence of Fis mutant proteins, we always included wild type Fis in the same set of experiments. RNA Extraction—Overnight cultures were diluted 20-fold in fresh prewarmed LB medium and grown at 37 °C. Total RNA was extracted from 3 ml of cell cultures after dilution at the indicated time intervals by a hot phenol procedure (41Hraiky C. Raymond M.A. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11257-11263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The RNA samples were further purified by use of RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and eluted from the RNeasy column in 30 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA concentration was determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm. Primer Extension Analysis—Primer NSL166 (5′-GGGTGTGCATAATACGCC-3′) was used in extension reactions to detect the RNA synthesized exclusively from the P1 promoters of four E. coli rRNA operons (rrnB, rrnA, rrnC, and rrnG). Primer NSL 939 (5′-ACGAGATAACACGGTTAAATCC-3′) was used to determine the RNA synthesized from the ompA promoters, P1 and P2. The expected extension products were 119 bases for rrn P1 and 93 and 89 bases for ompA P1 and P2, respectively. About 1 μg of total RNA and 2 pmol of each 32P-labeled primer were used in the extension reactions, using the AMV reverse transcriptase primer extension system (Promega) at 42 °C in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. After primer extension, the samples were loaded on 6% sequencing gel and analyzed by the PhosphorImager. The length of the transcripts was determined using corresponding sequencing reactions as references. Measurement of the Stability of the Leader rRNAs Initiated at the rrn P1 Promoters in Vivo—The overnight cultures of both MG1655 and MG1655 fis (DJ2592) were diluted 20-fold in fresh prewarmed LB medium and grown at 37 °C. After 30 min of incubation, rifampicin was added to the cells to a final concentration of 250 μg/ml, and samples were removed for RNA extraction at various intervals (0, 20, 40, 60, 120, and 240 s). For time 0, the RNA was extracted immediately before the addition of rifampicin. The RNAs were extracted, processed, and analyzed by primer extension for the leader rRNAs initiated at the rrn P1 promoter as described above. The amount of RNA samples used for primer extension assay was 1 μg for MG1655 and 2.5 μg for MG1655 fis. The products of primer extension were resolved on 6% sequencing gel and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Stringent RNAPs That Further Destabilize the Intrinsically Unstable Preinitiation Complexes at rrnB P1 Display Enhanced Activation by Fis—To understand the mechanism by which Fis activates transcription of rrnB P1, we initially analyzed the effect of Fis on the transcription of the promoter with the stringent RNAPs described above (Fig. 1). Although Fis activates transcription of rrnB P1 by wild type RNAP greatly only at high concentrations of KCl or NaCl (150 mm) in vitro (15Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the experiments were performed with low salt (30 mm KCl), because the syntheses of rrnB P1 by the stringent RNAPs were extremely sensitive to high salt (5Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that whereas these stringent RNAPs (RpoB114, RpoB3449, and RpoB3370) are defective in transcription of stringent promoters, they are proficient in transcription of RNAI (as a control for nonstringent promoter of plasmid origin) (5Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Since Fis does not affect RNAI synthesis, the effects of these stringent RNAPs on the transcription of rrnB P1 can be quantified as the ratios of the transcripts of rrnB P1 over RNAI. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, these mutant RNAPs were defective in the synthesis of rrnB P1 compared with wild type RNAP even at 30 mm KCl. Among them, RpoB3449 is the least defective (∼3.7-fold reduction), and RpoB114 is the most defective (∼15-fold reduction). At this low salt concentration, Fisactivated transcription of rrnB P1 by wild type RNAP only marginally (1.4-fold). However, Fis activated transcription of rrnB P1 by the stringent RNAPs 2–3-fold. In the presence of DNA competitor heparin (Fig. 1, C and D), which was added at the same time as NTPs to trap either dissociated or loosely DNA-bound RNAP (42Pfeffer S.R. Stahl S.J. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5403-5407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transcription of rrnB P1 by wild type RNAP was reduced only ∼10% compared with that in the absence of heparin (compare lane 1 in Fig. 1C with lane 1 in Fig. 1A), indicating that the preinitiation complexes were relatively stable at 30 mm KCl. Under this condition, Fis activated the transcription only marginally (1.6-fold). However, heparin exacerbated the defects of the stringent RNAPs in transcription of rrnB P1, resulting in a 2–3-fold reduction in transcripts compared with the amount obtained in the absence of the DNA competitor (compare lanes 3, 5, and 7 in Fig. 1A with lanes 3, 5, and 7 in Fig. 1C), consistent with the fact that the preinitiation complexes formed with these mutant RNAPs are significantly more unstable than wild type RNAP. Moreover, the Fis-mediated transcriptional activation of rrnB P1 by the stringent RNAPs was significantly increased in the presence of heparin, ranging from 4- to 6-fold. Note that these stringent RNAPs were still defective in transcription of rrnB P1 compared with wild type RNAP in the presence of Fis. It has been shown that these stringent RNAPs further destabilize the preinitiation complexes at rrnB P1 compared with wild type RNAP (5Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The fact that Fis activated transcription from rrnB P1 by the stringent RNAPs to a greater extent than by wild type RNAP under the conditions used indicates that Fis manifests a greater effect on the relatively unstable initiation complexes. Thus, our results suggest that Fis stabilizes metastable preinitiation complexes of the rrnB P1 promoter, leading to increased transcription. Fis Stabilizes the Interaction between RNAP and the rrnB P1 Promoter—We decided to determine the effect of Fis on the stability of RNAP-rrnB P1 preinitiation complexes directly. First, we found the conditions under which the half-lives of RNAP-rrnB P1 complexes could be measured experimentally upon challenge with a DNA competitor. Whereas Fis activated transcription of rrnB P1 by wild type RNAP to different extents in the absence of heparin with 30–150 mm KCl or NaCl, very little rrnB P1 transcription occurred in the presence of heparin and salt concentrations above 50 mm even with Fis (data not shown). With potassium glutamate, which is the major intracellular salt in E. coli (43Cayley S. Lewis B.A. Guttman H.J. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 281-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), Fis activates transcription of rrnB P1 from 200 to 500 mm either in the absence or presence of heparin (Fig. 2). Thus, we initially measured the half-life of RNAP-rrnB P1 complexes both at 40 mm KCl and 200 mm potassium glutamate. At 40 mm KCl in the absence of Fis, only a very small amount of rrnB P1 transcripts were synthesized by the wild type RNAP after a 15-s incubation with heparin, indicating that only a few complexes competent for initiation remained (Fig. 3A). Although the fast decay of the preinitiation complexes prevented us from obtaining an accurate value of the half-life, it was estimated to be much less than 15 s. However, in the presence of Fis, the preinitiation complexes became relatively resistant to heparin challenge (Fig. 3A), and the half-life of the RNAP-rrnB P1 complexes increased to about 30 s (Fig. 3B). Similarly, Fis also increased the half-life of wild type RNAP-rrnB P1 preinitiation complexes when 200 mm potassium glutamate was used (Fig. 3, C and D). With potassium glutamate, the half-life of the RNAP-rrnB P1 complexes in the absence of Fis was about 7 min, whereas in the presence of Fis, the half-life of the RNAP-rrnB P1 complexes increased to about 16 min. With either salt, Fis had no effect on the stability of preinitiation complexes at the RNAI promoter under the conditions used. We also determined the effect of Fis on the stability of RNAP-rrnB P1 preinitiation complexes with one of the least defective mutant RNAPs: RpoB3449. At 40 mm KCl, even in the presence of Fis, the interaction between RpoB3449 and rrnB P1 was too weak to measure t"

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic and Zeta-Sizer experiments indicated an electrostatic as well as a non-electrostatic binding of ααHb to the hydrophilic and to the hydrophobic moieties of the endotoxins with an increase of the inclination angle of the pLA backbone, with respect to the membrane surface, from 25° to more than 50°. Small angle synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction measurements indicated a reorientation of the lipid A aggregates from a multilamellar into a cubic structure as a result of ααHb interaction. Thus, in the absence of ααHb, the molecular shape of the pentaacyl samples was cylindrical with a moderate inclination of the diglucosamine backbone, whereas, in the presence of the protein, the shape was conical, and the inclination angle was high. The cytokine-inducing capability in human mononuclear cells, negligible for the pure pentaacylated compounds, increased markedly in the presence of ααHb in a concentration-dependent manner.

Endotoxins are one of the major agents that may cause septic shock; currently, no successful antiendotoxin therapies are available. LPS consists of a sugar portion with varying lengths of oligo- or polysaccharide chains depending on the type of bacterial mutant, i.e. rough mutant LPS Re to Ra or smooth form LPS. The polysaccharide component is covalently linked to the hydrophobic anchor of LPS, lipid A (2Rietschel E.T. Kirikae T. Schade F.U. Mamat U. Schmidt G. Loppnow H. Ulmer A.J. Zähringer U. Seydel U.

Schumann R.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 216: 39-81PubMed Google Scholar). There are various endotoxin-binding proteins, which may have considerable biological importance. The binding of these proteins to endotoxins is frequently only poorly characterized, but an understanding of the processes involved is important in light of the modifications of the LPS-induced responses (5Brandenburg K.

An activity-enhancing protein is hemoglobin (Hb), the four-subunit globular oxygen-carrying protein of vertebrates and some invertebrates. It is present in the red blood cells specialized for oxygen transport, which contain a high concentration of hemoglobin in their cytoplasm. Hb solutions are potentially clinically useful for resuscitation, elective surgery, shock, cancer therapy, sickle cell anemia, coronary balloon angioplasty, stroke. and myocardial ischemia (8Roth R.I.

Transfusion. 2001; 41: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In previous reports, it was found that the interaction of Hb with LPS results in a significant increase of the biological activity of LPS (8Roth R.I. Kaca W. Levin J. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1994; 388: 161-172PubMed Google Scholar, 10Roth R.I. Kaca W. Biomater. Artif. Cells Immobilization Biotechnol. 1994; 22: 387-398Google Scholar, 11Kaca W. Roth R.I. Levin J. J. Biol.

In addition, the lethal toxicity of LPS for rodents is enhanced in the presence of Hb (13Su D.H. Roth R.I. Yoshida M. Levin J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enhancement of the biological response was found to be associated with a Hb-induced disaggregation of LPS (11Kaca W. Roth R.I. Levin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25078-25084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Roth R.I. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. J. Endotoxin Res. 1996; 3: 361-366Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar).Recently, we characterized the binding of Hb with enterobacterial LPS and lipid A, and found that the increase of the LPS-induced cytokine induction was the result of an enhancement of the “endotoxic conformation” of the lipid A component of LPS (6Jürgens G. Müller M. Koch M.H.J. Brandenburg K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4233-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In that report, enterobacterial endotoxins were used, which a priori were highly active. From these results the question arises whether endotoxins that are only weakly active or completely inactive in biological systems because of a change in chemical structure also may become active by binding with Hb. To determine this, we selected a mutant pentaacylated LPS (pLPS) and the corresponding lipid A (pLA) from Escherichia coli strain F515, which has been shown to be agonistically inactive, i.e. induced cytokine production, if at all, only slightly, but in contrast, was antagonistically active (15Seydel U. Oikawa M. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Brandenburg K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3032-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have found that the interaction of crosslinked ααHb with the pentaacylated endotoxins has an electrostatic as well as a non-electrostatic hydrophobic character, which are associated with conversion of the endotoxins into an active form.MATERIALS AND METHODSLipids and Reagents—Lipopolysaccharide from a mutant of the deep rough mutant Re E. coli F515, which produced only a pentaacylated lipid A, in which the 3-OH-bound myristic acid at position 3′ of the non-reducing diglucosamine is lacking (15Seydel U. Oikawa M. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Brandenburg K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3032-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), was extracted from bacteria grown at 37 °C by the phenol/chloroform/petrol ether method (16Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar), purified, and lyophilized. Free lipid A was isolated by acetate buffer treatment of the mutant LPS F515. After isolation, lipid A was purified and converted to the triethylamine salt form. The known chemical structure of lipid A from LPS F515 was confirmed by the analysis of the amount of glucosamine and total and organic phosphate, and the distribution of the fatty acid residues, applying standard procedures. The amount of 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate never exceeded 5%. Additionally, the homogeneity of the endotoxin samples was checked with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy, which showed a mass peak at m/z = 1596 corresponding to pLA, but no peak at m/z = 1797, which would correspond to the hexaacyl lipid A. The lipids 3-sn-phosphatidylserine, egg 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin from bovine brain, and 3-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine from E. coli were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and cholesterol (Sigma grade) was from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany).Hemoglobin—Human hemoglobin was cross-linked between the Lys-99 residues of the α chains (ααHb) by treatment of deoxyhemoglobin with bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl) fumarate, as previously described (17Christensen S.M. Medina R. Winslow R.M. Snell S.M. Zegna A. Marini M.A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 17: 145-154Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by the Blood Research Detachment, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (Washington, DC). The stock solution was 71 mg/ml in Ringer's acetate, pH 7.4. It was sterile and essentially endotoxin-free (<100 pg/ml as assessed by the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay) (18Levin J. Bang F.B. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1968; 19: 186-197PubMed Google Scholar) and was stored at –70 °C until use. The initial methemoglobin concentration of the cross-linked Hb was always <7%.Native Hb from human blood was purchased from Sigma. It was also tested with respect to endotoxin contamination and was found to have only negligible activity in the Limulus test up to a Hb concentration of 100 μg/ml, as described recently (6Jürgens G. Müller M. Koch M.H.J. Brandenburg K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4233-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Sample Preparation—The lipid samples were usually prepared as aqueous dispersions at 85% water content using 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. For this, the lipids were suspended directly in buffer, temperaturecycled several times between 5 and 70 °C, and then stored at 4 °C for at least 12 h before measurement. This procedure gave the most reproducible results. For elucidation of the protein secondary structure in the absence and presence of endotoxins, 1 mm Hb was prepared in buffer made either in H2O or D2O and incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 h. Lipid dispersions prepared as described above then were added in appropriate amounts, and the mixture incubated at 37 °C for another 15 min. Afterward, 10 μl of these dispersions were spread on a CaF2 infrared window, and the excess buffer was evaporated slowly at 37 °C. For measurement of the lipid:protein interaction, the ααHb was added to the pentaacylated samples and the mixtures were preincubated at room temperature or at 37 °C for at least 0.5 h. The final concentration ratio [ααHb]:[pLA] or [ααHb]:[pLPS] was in the range 1:0 to 1:2 m, the latter ratio corresponding to a weight ratio of 36:1 or 28:1, respectively. For preparation of liposomes resembling the composition of the cell membrane of macrophages (PLMϕ), i.e. phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:0.7:0.5 (19Kröner E.E. Peskar B.A. Fischer H. Ferber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in some cases also cholesterol at a content of 20%, the lipids were solubilized in chloroform, the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipids were then resuspended in the appropriate volume of buffer, vortexed, extensively sonicated, and used for measurement not before the next day.FTIR Spectroscopy—The infrared spectroscopic measurements were performed on a FTIR spectrometer (5-DX; Nicolet Instruments, Madison, WI) and on an IFS-55 spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). The lipid samples were placed in a CaF2 cuvette with a 12.5-μm Teflon spacer. Temperature scans were performed automatically from 10 to 70 °C with a heating rate of 0.6 °C/min. Every 3 °C, 50 interferograms were accumulated, apodized, Fourier-transformed, and converted to absorbance spectra.For overlapping bands, in particular for the analysis of amide I-vi-bration, curve fitting was applied using a modified version of the CUR-FIT program obtained from D. Moffat (National Research Council, Ottawa, Canada). An estimate of the number of band components was obtained from deconvolution of the spectra (20Kauppinen J.K. Moffat D.J. Mantsch H.H. Cameron D.G. Appl. Spectrosc. 1981; 35: 271-276Crossref Google Scholar), and the curve was fitted to the original spectra after subtraction of base lines resulting from neighboring bands. As with the deconvolution technique, the band shapes of the single components are superpositions of Gaussian and Lorentzian. Best fits were obtained by assuming a Gauss fraction of 0.55-0.60.The order parameter S, a measure of the parallel alignment of the endotoxin molecules, was estimated as described earlier (21Brandenburg K. Mayer H. Koch M.H.J. Weckesser J. Rietschel E.T. Seydel U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), where S is calculated from the peak position of the symmetric stretching vibrational band xs of νs (CH2) by S = –941.8 + 0.7217·xs – 7.823·10–5·xs2 – 2.068·10–8·xs3. It should be noted that S defined in this way should be similar, but not identical, to the order parameter used in NMR spectroscopy (S = 1 for perfectly aligned and 0 for isotropic acyl chains).Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR)—The lipids were prepared as oriented thin multilayers as described (15Seydel U. Oikawa M. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Brandenburg K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3032-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), by spreading a 1 mm lipid suspension, which was temperature-cycled between 4 and 60 °C several times prior to spreading, in Hepes buffer on a zinc-selenium ATR plate, and evaporating the excess water by slow periodic movement under a nitrogen stream at room temperature. The lipid sample then was placed in a closed cuvette, and the air above the sample was saturated with water vapor to maintain full hydration. Infrared ATR spectra were recorded with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector with a scan number of 1000 at a resolution of 2 cm–1. The infrared radiation was polarized with a zinc-selenium wire-grid polarizer (Specac, Orpington, United Kingdom). The measurements were performed at 26 °C, the intrinsic instrument temperature, and in some cases also at 37 °C. In the present investigation, dichroic ratios R for particular vibrational bands from the diglucosamine backbone were evaluated at 1170, 1085, and 1045 cm–1. The angle θ represents the angle between the diglucosamine diphosphorylated backbone and the direction of the hydrocarbon chains, and can be calculated from the measured R, if an approximate value of the order parameter S is known (15Seydel U. Oikawa M. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Brandenburg K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3032-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As a first approximation, the S value calculated according to the equation between S, θ, and R, based on the peak position of the symmetric stretching vibration νs(CH2), can be used. Because the hydrocarbon chains of the lipid multilayer are distributed homogenously around the normal to the ATR plate (“partial axial distribution”), a tilt of the backbone with respect to the direction of the acyl chains leads to a broader orientational distribution of the backbone, which would correspond to a lower S value. This implies that the acyl chains are more isotropically distributed and that the estimate of S is an upper limit.The water content of the samples on the ATR crystal, which is important for an exact calculation of the z-component of the electric field, Ez, was estimated from the ratio between the peak intensities of the main OH-stretch around 3400 cm–1 and the antisymmetric stretch of the methylene groups around 2920 cm–1. Because this ratio depends on the chemical composition of the particular lipid/protein sample at a given water content, each sample was calibrated by recording IR spectra in transmission at various water contents and determining the corresponding peak ratios.Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—A stock solution of 1 mg/ml pLPS was dispersed in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. The pLPS aggregates were obtained by sonication as described previously (22Garidel P. Johann C. Blume A. J. Liposome Res. 2000; 10: 131-158Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Jürgens G. Müller M. Garidel P. Koch M.H.J. Nakakubo H. Blume A. Brandenburg K. J. Endotoxin Res. 2002; 8: 115-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A known amount of protein was added to the lipid dispersion at room temperature and the mixture slightly vortexed until full protein dissolution. DSC measurements were performed with a VP scanning calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc., Northhampton, MA) at a heating and cooling rate of 1 °C/min. Heating and cooling curves were measured in the temperature interval from 10 to 95 °C. Three consecutive heating and cooling scans were measured. For more detail see Ref. 24Blume A. Garidel P. Kemp, R.B. From Macromolecules to Man. 1st Ed. Vol. 4. Elsevier, Amsterdam1999: 109-173Google Scholar.Zeta Potential—Zeta potentials were determined with a Zeta-Sizer 4 (Malvern Instruments, Herrsching, Germany) at a scattering angle of 90° from the electrophoretic mobility by laser-Doppler anemometry as described previously (23Jürgens G. Müller M. Garidel P. Koch M.H.J. Nakakubo H. Blume A. Brandenburg K. J. Endotoxin Res. 2002; 8: 115-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The zeta potential was calculated according to the Helmholtz-Smoluchovski equation from the mobility of the aggregates in a driving electric field of 19.2 V·cm–1. It was determined for the endotoxins (0.1 mm) at different ααHb concentrations. As controls, the zeta potential was also determined for standard particles (latex) and 0.1 mm phosphatidylcholine liposomes and the same concentrations of ααHb.Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—The FRET assay was performed as described previously (5Brandenburg K. Jürgens G. Müller M. Fukuoka S. Koch M.H.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Jürgens G. Müller M. Garidel P. Koch M.H.J. Nakakubo H. Blume A. Brandenburg K. J. Endotoxin Res. 2002; 8: 115-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipid liposomes similar to the composition of the macrophage membrane, PLMϕ, were doubly labeled with the fluorescent dyes N-(7-nitrobenz-2oxa-1,3-diazol-4yl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) and N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Intercalation of unlabeled molecules into the doubly labeled liposomes leads to probe dilution, thus inducing a lower FRET efficiency; the emission intensity of the donor increases and that of the acceptor decreases (for clarity, only the quotient of the donor and acceptor emission intensity has been shown here).In all experiments, doubly labeled PLMϕ liposomes (0.01 mm) were prepared and after 50 s, LPS Re, ααHb, or coincubated LPS + ααHb (0.5 h at 37 °C) was added, and the NBD-PE donor fluorescence intensity at 531 nm was then monitored for at least 300 s. The final molar ratios of PLMϕ, LPS, and ααHb were 1:1:0.05.X-ray Diffraction—X-ray diffraction measurements were performed at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory outstation at the Hamburg synchrotron radiation facility HASYLAB, using the double focusing monochromator-mirror camera X33 (25Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instr. Meth. 1983; 208: 461-469Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Diffraction patterns in the range of the scattering vector 0.07 < s < 1 nm–1 (s = 2 sin θ/λ, 2θ the scattering angle, and λ the wavelength = 0.15 nm) were recorded at 40 °C with exposure times of 2 or 3 min, using a linear detector with delay line readout (26Boulin C. Kempf R. Koch M.H.J. McLaughlin S.M. Nucl. Instr. Meth. 1986; A249Google Scholar). The s axis was calibrated with tripalmitate, which has a periodicity of 4.06 nm at room temperature. Details of the data acquisition and evaluation system can be found elsewhere (27Gabriel A. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1977; 48 (399–407): 1303-1305Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The diffraction patterns were evaluated as described previously (28Brandenburg K. Funari S.S. Koch M.H.J. Seydel U. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), assigning the spacing ratios of the main scattering maxima to defined three-dimensional structures.Here, multilamellar and cubic structures are of particular relevance, and can be characterized by the following features. For multilamellar structures, the reflections are grouped in equidistant ratios, i.e. 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc., of the lamellar repeat distance dl. For cubic structures, these are non-lamellar three-dimensional structures. Their various space groups differ in the ratio of their spacings. The relationship between reciprocal spacing shkl = 1/dhkl and lattice constant, a, is shkl = [(h2 + k2 + l2)/a]1/2 (hkl = Miller indices of the corresponding set of planes).Determination of Endotoxin Activity by the Chromogenic Limulus Test—Endotoxin activity of [LPS]:[ααHb] mixtures at concentrations between 10 μg/ml and 10 pg/ml for both compounds was determined by a quantitative kinetic assay based on the reactivity of Gram-negative endotoxin with Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) (18Levin J. Bang F.B. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1968; 19: 186-197PubMed Google Scholar, 29Friberger P. Sörskog L. Nilsson K. Knös M. Watson S.W. Levin J. Novitsky T.J. Detection of Bacterial Endotoxin with the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Test. Alan R. Liss, New York1987: 149-169Google Scholar) using test kits 50-650U from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). pLA was pre-incubated with ααHb in a concentration ratio range of 1:0 to 1:30 m. The measurements were performed in duplicate, and the presented results are the mean of the two determinations. In this assay, saturation occurs at 50 endotoxin units (EU)·ml–1, and the resolution limit is ≤0.2 (EU)·ml–1. The endotoxin used for determining the standard curve (sensitivity versus endotoxin concentration) was from E. coli O55:B5 (Sigma).The red color of ααHb might interfere in the chromogenic Limulus test. However, at the ααHb concentrations used here, there was no measurable disturbance.Stimulation of Human Mononuclear Cells—For an examination of the cytokine-inducing capacity of the [endotoxin]:[ααHb] mixtures, human mononuclear cells (MNC) were stimulated with solutions of endotoxin and ααHb and the TNFα production of the cells was then determined in the supernatant. MNC were isolated from heparinized (20 IU/ml) blood taken from healthy donors and processed directly by mixing with an equal volume of Hanks' balanced solution and centrifugation on a Ficoll density gradient for 40 min (21 °C, 500 × g). The interphase layer of MNC was collected and washed twice in Hanks' medium and then once in serum-free RPMI 1640, which contained 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were resuspended in serum-free medium, and the cell number was equilibrated at 5 × 106/ml. For stimulation, 200 μl/well MNC (5 × 106 cells/ml) were transferred into 96-well culture plates. The stimuli were serially diluted in serum-free RPMI 1640 and added to the cultures at 20 μl/well. The cultures were then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation of the culture plates for 10 min at 400 × g and stored at –20 °C until determination of cytokine content.Immunological determination of TNFα in the cell supernatant was performed in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described elsewhere (30Gallati H. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1982; 20: 907-914PubMed Google Scholar). 96-well plates (Greiner, Solingen, Germany) were coated with a monoclonal antibody against TNF (clone 6b from Intex AG, Muttant, Switzerland). Cell culture supernatants and the standard (recombinant TNF (rTNF); Intex) were diluted with buffer. After exposure to appropriately diluted test samples or serial dilutions of standard rTNF, the plates were exposed to rabbit anti-human TNFα Ig-peroxidase conjugate. The plates then were shaken for 16 –24 h at 4 °C and subsequently washed six times in distilled water to remove the free antibodies. Subsequently, the colorimetric reaction was started by addition of tetramethylbenzidine/H2O2 in alcoholic solution and stopped after 5–15 min by addition of 1 n sulfuric acid. In the colorimetric reaction, the substrate is cleaved enzymatically, and the product was measured photometrically on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Rainbow, Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) at a wavelength of 450 nm; the values were related to the standard. TNFα was determined in duplicate at two different dilutions, and the values were averaged.RESULTSIn the current investigation, the interaction of ααHb was studied with pLPS and pLA. Because lipid A is known to represent the “endotoxic” principle of LPS, most experiments were performed with PLA, and in selected cases also with pLPS from a deep rough mutant of E. coli.β ↔ α Acyl Chain Melting Behavior—The influence of different ααHb concentrations on the gel to liquid crystalline (β ↔ α) phase transition of the acyl chains of pLA was investigated utilizing FTIR, by evaluating the peak position of the symmetric stretching vibration of the methylene groups νs(CH2) lying around 2850 cm–1 in the gel phase and 2852.5 cm–1 in the liquid crystalline phase. The results plotted for pLA at different ααHb concentrations (Fig. 1A) exhibited a clear increase in the phase transition temperature TC from 26 to 33 °C at the highest Hb concentration. This effect was accompanied by a decrease of acyl chain fluidity (rigidification), as indicated by the decrease of the wave number values. At 37 °C, the latter decreased from 2852.5 to 2851.8 cm–1.Competition measurements were performed with the cationic polypeptide polymyxin B (PMB),"

Expression of Cst10 was specific to cartilage, localized in the cytosol of prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes of the mouse growth plate. In the mouse chondrogenic cell line ATDC5, Cst10 expression preceded type X collagen expression and increased in synchrony with maturation. When we compared ATDC5 cells transfected with Cst10 cDNA with cells transfected with a mock vector, hypertrophic maturation and mineralization of chondrocytes were promoted by Cst10 gene overexpression in that type X collagen expression was observed earlier, and alizarin red staining was stronger. On the other hand, type II collagen expression and Alcian blue staining, both of which are markers of the early stage of chondrocyte differentiation, were similar in both cells. Overexpression of the Cst10 gene also caused fragmentation of nuclei, the appearance of annexin V, a change in the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspases. These results strongly suggest that Cst10 may play an important role in the last steps of the chondrocyte differentiation pathway as an inducer of maturation, followed by apoptosis of chondrocytes.

These results strongly suggest that Cst10 may play an important role in the last steps of the chondrocyte differentiation pathway as an inducer of maturation, followed by apoptosis of chondrocytes. Endochondral ossification is an essential process for skeletal development, bone growth, and fracture healing and is implicated in pathological conditions such as osteoarthritis and ectopic ossification. During this process, chondrocytes first proliferate and then progressively differentiate into mature hypertrophic chondrocytes. Once fully matured, these hypertrophic cells mineralize the surrounding matrix and undergo apoptosis. This is followed by a local recruitment of blood vessels and osteoclasts, leading to progressive replacement of cartilage by bone. Thus, in this process of endochondral bone formation, proliferation, maturation, mineralization, and apoptosis of chondrocytes must be properly coordinated. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of endochondral ossification, we have been attempting to isolate novel genes implicated in this process (1Koshizuka Y. Ikegawa S. Sano M. Nakamura K. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 94: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Koshizuka Y. Ikegawa S. Sano M. Nakamura K. Nakamura Y.

Cell Genet. 2000; 90: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Okawa A. Nakamura I. Goto S. Moriya H. Nakamura Y. Ikegawa S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). For this study, we took advantage of the naturally occurring mouse mutant ttw (tiptoe walking), which exhibits ectopic ossification in various soft tissues such as tendons, cartilage, and ligaments of the extremities and the spine (5Hosoda Y. Yoshimura Y. Higaki A. Ryumachi. 1981; 21: 157-164PubMed Google Scholar). We previously found that ttw is caused by a nonsense mutation of the nucleotide pyrophosphatase gene encoding an ectoenzyme generating phosphate and pyrophosphate (4Okawa A. Nakamura I. Goto S. Moriya H. Nakamura Y. Ikegawa S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that a high phosphate diet accelerates ectopic ossification of ttw, using a differential display method, we identified nine mouse genes whose expression is regulated by a high phosphate diet (1Koshizuka Y. Ikegawa S. Sano M. Nakamura K. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 94: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six of the nine genes were novel; and among them, we isolated one, termed cystatin 10 (Cst10), 1The abbreviations used are: Cst10cystatin 10BACbacterial artificial chromosomeFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateRTreverse transcriptionCstCcystatin CPBSphosphate-buffered salinePIpropidium iodidepNAp-nitroanilideBMPbone morphogenetic proteinPTHrPparathyroid hormone-related protein.1The abbreviations used are: Cst10cystatin 10BACbacterial artificial chromosomeFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateRTreverse transcriptionCstCcystatin CPBSphosphate-buffered salinePIpropidium iodidepNAp-nitroanilideBMPbone morphogenetic proteinPTHrPparathyroid hormone-related protein. that is up-regulated by a high phosphate diet and is expressed exclusively in cartilage, suggesting its specific role in endochondral bone formation. cystatin 10 bacterial artificial chromosome fluorescein isothiocyanate reverse transcription cystatin C phosphate-buffered saline propidium iodide p-nitroanilide bone morphogenetic protein parathyroid hormone-related protein. cystatin 10 bacterial artificial chromosome fluorescein isothiocyanate reverse transcription cystatin C phosphate-buffered saline propidium iodide p-nitroanilide bone morphogenetic protein parathyroid hormone-related protein. In this study, we first characterized temporal and spatial expression patterns of Cst10, a novel member of the cystatin superfamily. The cystatin superfamily is known to inhibit the papain-like cysteine proteinases cathepsins B, H, and L by the formation of a tight reversible complex (6Barrett A.J. Fritz H. Grubb A. Isemura S. Jarvinen M. Katunuma N. Machleidt W. Muller-Esterl W. Sasaki M. Turk V. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 312Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These cysteine proteinases are thought to be associated with terminal degradation of proteins in lysosomes, so the cystatin superfamily is ubiquitously expressed and exhibits various biological functions (7Reinheckel T. Deussing J. Roth W. Peters C. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2001; 382: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present study reveals that Cst10 is expressed exclusively in mature chondrocytes. In addition, overexpression of the Cst10 gene accelerates hypertrophic maturation, mineralization, and apoptosis of chondrocytes. These data suggest a crucial and specific role of Cst10 in the later stage of endochondral ossification, implying a physiological role distinct from those other members of the cystatin superfamily. Determination of the Genomic Structure of the Mouse Cst10 Gene—Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing the mouse Cst10 gene were isolated using a BAC PCR screening system (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The set of primers used for screening was Cst10/BAC/F (5′-TCCTGAGGATATATGTCAGGC-3′) and Cst10/BAC/R (5′-ATCTCTGTCTGAGGAAAGGAG-3′). To determine the size of introns of the Cst10 gene, interexon PCRs were carried out with primers designed according to the cDNA sequence we determined in this study. The BAC clones and PCR products were sequenced directly, and the exon-intron junctions were determined by comparing the genomic sequences obtained with the corresponding cDNA sequences. Chromosomal Localization—To determine the chromosomal localization of the mouse Cst10 gene, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization as described previously (8Inazawa J. Saito H. Ariyama T. Abe T. Nakamura Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A BAC clone containing the mouse Cst10 gene was labeled and hybridized to the mouse metaphase chromosome. Hybridization signals were rendered visible with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-avidin. Precise assignments of the signals were determined by visualization of the replicated G-bands. Animals—The ddY and ttw mice were purchased from Shizuoka Laboratories Animal Center (Shizuoka, Japan) and the Central Institute for Experimental Animals (Kanagawa, Japan), respectively. All animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain (9Zimmermann M. Pain. 1983; 16: 109-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6755) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Primary mesenchymal cells (osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and fibroblasts) were extracted from the calvariae, costal cartilage, and skin, respectively, of neonatal ddY mice as described previously (10Kawaguchi H. Manabe N. Miyaura C. Chikuda H. Nakamura K. Kuro-o M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 11Shimoaka T. Ogasawara T. Yonamine A. Chikazu D. Kawano H. Nakamura K. Itoh N. Kawaguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7493-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in α-modified minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. Mouse chondrogenic ATDC5 cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Saitama, Japan). The cells were cultured in medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml human transferrin (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), and 3 × 10-8m sodium selenite (Sigma) as described previously (12Shukunami C. Ishizeki K. Atsumi T. Ohta Y. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1174-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The inoculum density of the cells was 4 × 104 cells/well in 12-multiwell plates (Corning Inc., New York). For induction of chondrogenesis, the cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The medium was replaced every other day. Expression of the Cst10 Transcript—Expression of the Cst10 mRNA was examined by semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, followed by Southern blotting using auricular cartilage from ttw mice, mesenchymal cells from neonatal ddY mice, and cultured mouse chondrogenic ATDC5 cells. For the experiments with ttw mice, the mice were divided into two groups according to the content of phosphate in the diet, i.e. high (0.87%) and low (0%) phosphate groups after weaning at 3 weeks of age. The animals were killed 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days after the start of the diet, and the auricular cartilage was resected en bloc. Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR was done using the following set of primers: Cst10/3′/F (5′-TCC TGA GGA TAT ATG TCA AT-3′) and Cst10/3′/R (5′-GAA CAG TGG GCC TTT GAA AA-3′). The following amplification cycle was used: 2 min of initial denaturation at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles at 94, 60, and 72 °C for 30 s each plus extension at 72 °C for 4 min. The primers and RT-PCR conditions used for type II and X collagens were as described previously (13Wang D. Canaff L. Davidson D. Corluka A. Liu H. Hendy G.N. Henderson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33995-34005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PCR products were electrophoresed and detected by Southern hybridization. For quantification of type X collagen mRNA levels, the density of each band was measured by NIH Image Version 1.62 2Available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/download.html. and is expressed as the ratio to the density of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Immunoblot Analysis—Polyclonal antibody against the full-length Cst10 protein was raised in rabbits using a synthetic peptide of Cst10. For preparation of the whole cell lysate, adherent and detached cells were collected and resuspended in chilled lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin). Collected cells were allowed to lyse by sonication on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The culture medium was collected and centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. The pellet obtained from the supernatants by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 20 min was resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Fifty-μg portions of SDS sample buffer were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse recombinant cystatin C (CstC) protein was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein bands on Western blots were visualized by chemiluminescent detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunohistochemistry—The samples harvested from embryonic mice (18 days postcoitus) were demineralized in 10% EDTA for 1 week at 4 °C. The specimens were dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol and then embedded in paraffin. Cst10 immunolocalization was examined in 4-μm-thick dewaxed paraffin sections. The sections were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min at room temperature and then with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 60 min at room temperature. They were then incubated with polyclonal antibody against mouse Cst10 for 24 h at 4 °C and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the sections were immersed in diaminobenzidine solution for 10 min at room temperature for visualization and counterstained with hematoxylin. Nonimmune rabbit serum at the same concentration was used as a negative control. For ultrastructural analysis, these sections were observed under a transmission electron microscope (H-7100, Hitachi, Tokyo) following the pre-embedding method described previously (14Hoshi K. Ejiri S. Ozawa H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryonic mice (18 days postcoitus) were perfused through the left ventricle with a 2-ml dose of a mixture of 4% paraform-aldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.08 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). The tibiae were then removed and immersed in the same fixative for 2 h at 4 °C. Specimens were decalcified with 4.13% EDTA at 4 °C for 1 day and cryosectioned at a thickness of 10 μm by cryomicrotome. The cryosections were treated following methods similar to those used for immunohistochemical investigations, being post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. The specimens were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in Poly/Bed 812 resin (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Ultrathin sections stained with lead citrate were used for transmission electron microscopic observation. Establishment of ATDC5 Cells Stably Transfected with the Cst10 Gene—The entire sequence of Cst10 cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) including the cytomegalovirus promoter with a hemagglutinin epitope tag at the C terminus (pCMV-Cst10). The subcloned cDNA fragment was confirmed by sequencing. ATDC5 cells (2 × 105) were plated in a 6-cm culture dish 24 h before transfection. pCMV-Cst10 (4 mg/6-cm culture dish) or the mock vector (pCMV) was transfected into ATDC5 cells by lipofection using SuperFect transfection reagent (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days later, cells were diluted 10-fold and incubated in a maintenance medium containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). After 2 weeks, we isolated drug-resistant colonies, each of which was derived from a single clone, and cultured them separately. To confirm the reproducibility of the effects of Cst10 overexpression, we performed two experiments with independent transfection procedures. For the first experiment, we established 18 stable clones from 18 different colonies of ATDC5 cells transfected with pCMV-Cst10 and selected three clones (clones 3, 8, and 12) with the highest expression of Cst10 (pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5) by RT-PCR analysis. Three mock vector-transfected clones (clones 1–3) that were confirmed by RT-PCR not to express Cst10 were also selected as negative controls (pCMV/ATDC5). For the second experiment, we independently transfected pCMV-Cst10 into ATDC5 cells as described above, randomly established four stable clones, and examined the relationship of expressions between Cst10 and collagens by RT-PCR. Alcian Blue and Alizarin Red Staining—pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5 and pCMV/ATDC5 cells were placed in 12-multiwell plates and cultured. Twenty-one days after induction by insulin, cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 95% methanol for 20 min. They were then stained overnight with 0.1% Alcian blue 8GS (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) in 0.1 m HCl. Twenty-eight days after induction by insulin, cultures were stained with 1% alizarin red S (pH 4.0) (Sigma) after fixation with 95% ethanol. Detection of Apoptosis and Activities of Caspases—Apoptosis of pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5 and pCMV/ATDC5 cells was examined by nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342, externalization of phosphatidylserine residues using FITC-labeled annexin V, mitochondrial membrane potential, and flow cytometric analysis. Annexin V binding assay was performed using an FITC-labeled annexin V apoptosis detection kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol (15Fadok V.A.

Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). Briefly, ATDC5 cells were harvested 7 days after induction with insulin and washed with PBS. Cells were then incubated with binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.8 mm CaCl2) containing 2 μl of FITC-labeled annexin V and 5 μg of propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, they were viewed under a fluorescent microscope. PI was added to distinguish cells with membrane permeability due to the loss of membrane integrity, which is characteristic of necrotic cell death. To assess the mitochondrial membrane potential, a MitoCapture apoptosis detection kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories) was used (18Ogawa Y. Nishioka A. Kobayashi T. Kariya S. Hamasato S. Saibara T. Seguchi H. Yoshida S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 603-607PubMed Google Scholar). ATDC5 cells harvested 7 days after induction were incubated with MitoCapture solution for 15 min at 37 °C and viewed under a fluorescent microscope using a band-pass filter (detects FITC and rhodamine). In healthy cells, MitoCapture accumulates and aggregates in the mitochondria, giving off a bright red fluorescence. In apoptotic cells, MitoCapture cannot aggregate in the mitochondria due to the altered mitochondrial membrane potential and thus remains in the cytoplasm in its monomer form, fluorescing green. For flow cytometric analysis, ATDC5 cells were harvested 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days after induction by insulin and fixed with 75% ethanol and PBS at 4 °C for 1 h. After rinsing twice with PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min with 1 ml of PBS containing 1 mg of boiled RNase at 37 °C and then stained with 1 ml of PBS containing 10 μg of PI. A total of 2 × 104 cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCaliber, BD Biosciences). To determine whether caspase-3 is activated in pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5, a PhiLux kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol (19Komoriya A. Packard B.Z. Brown M.J. Wu M.L. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, ATDC5 cells harvested 7 days after induction were incubated with 10 mm GDEVDGI and labeled with two molecules of rhodamine, which was selectively cut by caspase-3. After incubation, cells were viewed under a fluorescent microscope. Caspase-3 activity was determined with a caspase-3/CPP32 colorimetric protease assay kit (Medical and Biological Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, ATDC5 cells were harvested 7 days after induction with insulin and lysed in lysis buffer. Cell lysate (150 μg of protein in 50 μl of lysis buffer) was incubated with DEVD-p-nitroanilide (pNA) as a substrate for 1 h at 37 °C, and the amount of pNA generated was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities were determined with caspase-8/FLICE and caspase-9/Mch6 colorimetric protease assay kits, respectively (Medical and Biological Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's protocols. IETD-p-nitroanilide for caspase-8 and LEHD-p-nitroanilide for caspase-9 were used as substrates. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the amount of p-nitroanilide generated was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm (20Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A.

Statistical Analysis—Means of groups were compared by analysis of variance, and significance of differences was determined by post-hoc testing using Bonferroni's method. Characterization of the Cst10 Gene—In a previous study, using differential display analysis, we identified nine genes, including Cst10, whose expression is regulated in the auricular cartilage of ttw mice fed a high phosphate diet (1Koshizuka Y. Ikegawa S. Sano M. Nakamura K. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 94: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA sequence of the mouse Cst10 gene determined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends is 789 bp long and has an open reading frame of 447 bp, coding for 148 amino acids (DDBJ/GenBank™/EBI accession number AB036743). The mouse Cst10 gene consists of three exons spanning 4.2 kb on genomic DNA. All of the sequences of the exon-intron junction were confirmed to be the consensus sequences for splicing boundaries (AG/GT rule). The predicted amino acid sequence contains two intrachain disulfide bridges and a cystatin domain (consensus (GSTEQKRV)Q(LIVT)(VAF)(SAGQ)GX-(LIVMNK)X2(LIVMFY)X(LIVMFYA)(DENQKRHSIV)), indicating a novel member of the type II cystatin superfamily with 40.5 and 39.0% homologies to mouse and human CstC (Cst3), respectively, the closest cystatin family member (Fig. 1A). Its homologies to other mouse cystatins were around or less than 30%: 31.5% to Cst9, 31.4% to Cst7, 27.0% to CstEM, 28.6% to CstSC, and 26.7% to CstTE. To investigate the localization of the Cst10 gene in the mouse chromosome, >50 metaphase cells were examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a BAC clone containing the mouse Cst10 gene as a probe. Specific hybridization signals were identified on chromosome 2 in almost all cells, and no significant background was observed at any other chromosomal sites (Fig. 1B). Temporal and Spatial Expression of Cst10 in Vivo and in Vitro—We first examined the temporal expression pattern of Cst10 mRNA levels in the auricular cartilage of ttw mice whose endochondral ossification was enhanced with a high phosphate diet. Expression appeared 3 days after weaning and was upregulated by a high phosphate diet at 5 days and thereafter (Fig. 2A). Our previous study on the tissue distribution of Cst10 expression in a variety of mouse tissues showed that this gene is expressed exclusively in cartilage (1Koshizuka Y. Ikegawa S. Sano M. Nakamura K. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 94: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the expression pattern of Cst10 using cell cultures. Among three cultured mesenchymal cells from neonatal ddY mice (primary osteoblasts from calvariae, chondrocytes from costal cartilage, and fibroblasts from skin), Cst10 expression was confirmed to be specific to chondrocytes (Fig. 2B). To characterize the expression pattern during differentiation of chondrocytes, we used the mouse chondrogenic cell line ATDC5, which can be induced to differentiate into mature chondrocytes in the presence of insulin (12Shukunami C. Ishizeki K. Atsumi T. Ohta Y. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1174-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). During induction of differentiation with insulin, expression of type II collagen remained unchanged throughout the culture period up to 14 days, whereas that of type X collagen, a marker for hypertrophic chondrocytes, appeared 7 days after induction (Fig. 2C). Expression of the Cst10 gene appeared at 3 days and increased thereafter, indicating that Cst10 expression is in synchrony with the maturation of chondrocytes. To examine the localization of Cst10 in cartilage, we first confirmed by Western blot analysis the specificity of a polyclonal antibody against Cst10 without cross-reactivity with CstC, the closest member of the cystatin superfamily (Fig. 2D). Using this antibody, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on the growth plates of embryonic ddY mice and found that Cst10 was expressed mainly in mature chondrocytes, including prehypertrophic and hypertrophic cells (Fig. 2E). Electron microscopic examination of a hypertrophic chondrocyte revealed that Cst10 was immunolocalized in the cytosolic areas, but was not found in the nucleus or within the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2F). These findings suggest that Cst10 is not transported into the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum system, but acts as an intracellular protein in the cytosol. Overexpression of the Cst10 Gene Accelerates Maturation of ATDC5 Cells—To elucidate the function of Cst10 in chondrocytes, we established stable clones of ATDC5 cells overexpressing the Cst10 gene (pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5). We first compared by RT-PCR the differentiation of pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5 cells with that of control clones of ATDC5 cells transfected with the mock vector (pCMV/ATDC5) upon induction with insulin (Fig. 3A). In pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5 cells, Cst10 mRNA expression was clearly seen not only after, but also before induction (time 0), whereas in pCMV/ATDC5 cells, expression was faintly seen 7 days after induction and increased moderately thereafter. Western blot analysis revealed that the Cst10 protein was localized in the cell lysate, but not in the culture medium of pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5 cells (Fig. 3B), indicating that Cst10 is not a secreted protein. Expression of type II collagen, which is known to be produced by chondrocytes from their early phase of differentiation, was constitutively seen before and after induction, and expression was not different between pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5 and pCMV/ATDC5 cells (Fig. 3A). However, expression of type X collagen, a marker of hypertrophic chondrocytes, was observed earlier and was stronger in pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5 cells than in pCMV/ATDC5 cells. We also compared the cartilage nodule formation and mineralization between cultured pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5 and pCMV/ATDC5 cells using Alcian blue and alizarin red staining, respectively. No difference was seen in the Alcian blue staining between the two cells; however, alizarin red staining was stronger in cultured pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5 cells than in pCMV/ATDC5 cells (Fig. 3C). To confirm the reproducibility of the effects of Cst10 overexpression, we performed another experiment using ATDC5 cell clones that were independently transfected with pCMV-Cst10 and isolated. In this experiment, we randomly established four stable clones and compared the mRNA levels of Cst10 and type II and X collagens by RT-PCR before (time 0) and 5 days after induction (Fig. 3D). The Cst10 mRNA levels were not changed before or after induction in all clones. There was a good correlation between the Cst10 and type X collagen levels at 5 days, although the type II collagen levels were similar among the clones (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that overexpression of the Cst10 gene accelerates the later (but not earlier) stage of chondrocyte differentiation and mineralization. Overexpression of Cst10 Leads to Apoptosis of ATDC5 Cells—Staining with Hoechst 33342 revealed the existence of cells with fragmented and condensed nuclei with increased fluorescence, suggesting apoptotic cell death in pCMV-Cst10/ATDC5 cells, but not in pCMV/ATDC5 cel"

By DNA transfection and sodium bisulfite sequencing, we show here that overexpression of dDnmt2, which is the only expressed and cloned Drosophila protein consisting of motifs conserved among the DNA cytosine methyltransferases, results in genomic DNA methylation of Drosophila S2 cells. The data provide the first evidence for dDnmt2 being one candidate gene encoding the Drosophila DNA methyltransferase(s)."

The generation of genetic diversity is a result of homologous recombination but it is not the main function of recombination (1Clark A.J. Sandler S.J. Crit. Rev.

Recombinational repair of stalled or collapsed replication forks takes place frequently, even under the normal growth conditions. A similar link between replication and recombination is also observed in eukaryotes (3Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8173-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Thus, the primary function of homologous recombination seems to be the repair of prematurely terminated replication forks. In addition, double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble-strand breakTopo IVtopoisomerase IVntnucleotide(s)oligooligonucleotide.1The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble-strand breakTopo IVtopoisomerase IVntnucleotide(s)oligooligonucleotide. are repaired only by homologous recombination in prokaryotes, which may explain why the mutations in recombination genes cause the hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents (10Clark A.J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).There are three steps in the major pathway for conjugational recombination in E. coli: the initiation of recombination by RecBCD, RecA-mediated homologous pairing and strand exchange, and the branch migration and the resolution of the Holliday junction by RuvABC (1Clark A.J. Sandler S.J. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 20: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 11Eggleston A.K. West S.C.

Genet. 1997; 31: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). During the late stage of homologous recombination, RuvA forms a tetramer, binds specifically to the Holliday junction, and then loads RuvB, a hexameric helicase. Two RuvB hexamers sandwich two RuvA tetramers at the Holliday junction to form the RuvAB branch migration complex. The RuvB helicase functions as a molecular motor to promote the branch migration process. RuvC dimer interacts with the RuvAB complex and cleaves the Holliday junction in a sequence-specific manner (14West S.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).Topoisomerases are responsible for DNA unlinking (15Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 16Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). These enzymes break and rejoin the DNA strand by forming a covalent linkage between the enzyme and the DNA at the site of scission. This covalent topoisomerase·DNA complex is normally a fleeting catalytic intermediate, and the steady-state level of the covalent topoisomerase·DNA complex depends on the cleavage-religation equilibrium. Some topoisomerase inhibitors affect the cleavage-religation equilibrium of a topoisomerase and trap a covalent topoisomerase·DNA complex as a topoisomerase·drug·DNA ternary complex. These drugs, with proven clinical antimicrobial and anticancer activities, are often referred to as “topoisomerase poisons” (17Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Formation of drug-induced covalent topoisomerase·DNA complexes is necessary, but not sufficient, for the cytotoxicity of the drug. In fact, topoisomerase·drug·DNA ternary complexes are completely reversible. An active DNA transaction, such as the passage of a replication fork, must take place to disrupt a ternary complex and generate a permanent DNA damage. Topoisomerase poisoning results in the inhibition of DNA replication and the generation of DSBs (18Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

However, the downstream events of replication fork arrest, including the mechanisms of DSB generation, have not been completely understood. Mutations in genes for homologous recombination, such as recA and recB, increase the susceptibility to quinolone drugs (23Khodursky A.B. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27668-27677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, homologous recombination plays a critical role in the repair of quinolone-induced DNA damage.DNA helicases function as molecular motors and play essential roles in many aspects of DNA transaction including DNA replication, DNA repair, and recombination (26Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 27Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The unwinding of duplex DNA catalyzed by DNA helicases is critical for the continuous progression of such processes. We have shown that Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complexes inhibit the unwinding activities of DnaB, T7 Gene 4, and SV40 T-antigen helicases (28Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All of these replicative helicases are hexameric helicases (27Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complexes also inhibit the action of UvrD, a repair helicase (28Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, it is concluded that the formation of Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complexes causes a general inhibition of DNA helicases.Here, we investigated the effect of Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complexes on the RuvAB branch migration complex. The homologous recombination process, including the RuvAB-catalyzed branch migration, must proceed in the presence of topoisomerase·quinolone·DNA ternary complexes to repair DSBs generated by the quinolone treatment and/or restart the replication fork stalled by a topoisomerase·quinolone·DNA ternary complex. The question was: Does the Topo IV·norfloxacin· DNA ternary complex inhibit the translocation of the RuvAB complex? We employed a strand-displacement assay to address this question. RuvAB was capable of reversing and displacing Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complexes to continue its translocation in vitro. These results indicated that the RuvAB branch migration complex could remove topoisomerase· quinolone·DNA ternary complexes to complete the recombinational repair of DSBs and/or the replication restart in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNAs and Proteins—The construction of M13-T440 (28Shea M.E.

RuvA and RuvB proteins were overexpressed and purified according to protocols described previously (31Iwasaki H. Shiba T. Makino K. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5276-5280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tsaneva I.R. Illing G. Lloyd R.G. West S.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The final preparations of RuvA and RuvB were greater than 97% homogeneous for a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The concentrations of purified proteins were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified RuvA and RuvB proteins, generous gifts of Kenneth Marians (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), were also used.Strand-displacement Assay for the RuvAB Complex—Standard reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 23 °C), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, and 10 fmol (as molecule) DNA substrate, either T440 or T440T. Three hundred fmol (as tetramer) of Topo IV, either in the absence or presence of 400 μm norfloxacin, were bound to the DNA substrate in the first stage incubation of 5 min at 37 °C. The indicated amounts of RuvA (as tetramer) and RuvB (as hexamer) proteins were then added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated during the second stage for 15 min at 37 °C.Reactions were terminated by adding EDTA to 25 mm, followed by the addition of a quarter volume of a dye mixture containing 15% glycerol, 2% sarkosyl, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 50 mm EDTA. Aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis through vertical 1% agarose (Seakem ME, BioWhittaker Molecular Applications) gels (140 × 120 × 3 mm) at 5 V/cm for 2 h in a running buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 23 °C), 40 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (TAE buffer). Portions of reaction mixtures were also analyzed by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide (19:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) gels (140 × 160 × 1.2 mm) at 25 V/cm for 1 h using 50 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3) and 1 mm EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer (TBE buffer). Gels were dried under vacuum onto DE81 papers (Whatman) and autoradiographed with Hyperfilm MP films (Amersham Biosciences). Strand displacement was quantitated by scanning images by a STORM 840 PhosphoImager (Amersham Biosciences).Topo IV-catalyzed Cleavage Assay—Standard reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 23 °C), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, 10 fmol (as molecule) DNA substrate, either T440 or T440T, 300 fmol (as tetramer) of Topo IV, and the indicated concentrations of norfloxacin were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min (or the indicated times). SDS was added to 1% and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. EDTA and proteinase K were then added to 25 mm and 100 μg/ml, respectively, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. The DNA products were purified by extraction of the reaction mixtures with phenol-chloroform (1:1, v/v), heat-denatured by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, and then analyzed by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide (19:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) gels (140 × 160 × 1.2 mm) at 25 V/cm for 1 h using TBE buffer. Gels were dried under vacuum onto DE81 papers (Whatman) and autoradiographed with Hyperfilm MP films (Amersham Biosciences). The extent of cleavage was quantitated by scanning images by a STORM 840 PhosphoImager (Amersham Biosciences).Displacement Assay for Topo IV·Quinolone·DNA Ternary Complexes—The reaction mixtures (200 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 23 °C), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, and 80 fmol (as molecule) T440T DNA. First, 2.4 pmol (as tetramer) of Topo IV, in the presence of 400 μm norfloxacin, were bound to the DNA substrate in the first stage incubation of 5 min at 37 °C. Four pmol each of RuvA (as tetramer) and RuvB (as hexamer) were then added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated during the second stage at 37 °C. Portions (25 μl each) were taken at indicated times. One half of the sample was used for the strand-displacement assay to assess the extent of strand displacement, and the other half was used for the cleavage assay to determine the extent of ternary complexes remained on the DNA. For the strand-displacement assay, reactions were terminated by adding EDTA to 25 mm. DNA products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described in the previous section. For the cleavage assay, reactions were terminated by adding SDS to 1%. DNA products were processed, purified, and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described in the previous section.RESULTSPartial Duplex DNAs—A pair of partial duplex DNAs, T440 and T440T (Fig. 1), were prepared by annealing 5′-end-labeled oligos, T4-62 and T4-62-tail, to the M13-T440 single-stranded DNA, respectively. These oligos are complementary to the cloned Topo IV binding site and the 40-bp-long Topo IV binding site was located in the middle of the 62-bp duplex region on both partial duplex DNAs (28Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, these two partial duplex DNAs differed only by the presence of a 25-nt non-hybridized tail at the 3′-end of the duplex region in T440T DNA (Fig. 1).First, we examined the stimulation of Topo IV-catalyzed cleavage by norfloxacin using either T440 or T440T as a substrate. As we have reported previously (28Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we observed cleavage of the annealed oligo as a result of a norfloxacin-stimulated, Topo IV-catalyzed cleavage (Fig. 2A). Both T440 and T440T were cleaved to a similar extent (Fig. 2B). We have previously demonstrated that the norfloxacin-stimulated, Topo IV-catalyzed DNA cleavage and the nofloxacin-stimulated Topo IV binding to the DNA coincided with each other (28Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, we assumed that the Topo IV-catalyzed cleavage in the presence of various concentrations of norfloxacin shown in Fig. 2 correlated with the extent of Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complexes formed on the partial duplex DNA. In addition, because of the length of the duplex region, it was likely that only one molecule of Topo IV could bind to each partial duplex DNA. Note that Topo IV does not bind to single-stranded DNA (30Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This system allowed us to monitor the events during the collision between a RuvAB complex and a Topo IV·norfloxacin· DNA ternary complex.Fig. 2Norfloxacin-induced, Topo IV-catalyzed cleavage of the partial duplex DNAs.A, the DNA cleavage assay using Topo IV, the partial duplex DNA, either T440 or T440T, and the indicated concentrations of norfloxacin were performed and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the extent of cleavage as a function of the norfloxacin concentration was quantitated using a Phosphor-Imager. Either T440 (open circle) or T440T (closed circle) was used as a substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A 3′-Non-hybridized Tail Stimulates RuvAB-catalyzed Helicase Activity in Vitro—The strand-displacement assay is a useful and the most commonly used system to measure the unwinding activity of DNA helicases (26Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). A partial duplex DNA, an oligo annealed to the single-stranded M13 DNA, is often used as a substrate. In the initial characterization of RuvAB helicase activity, a strand-displacement assay was used to demonstrate its helicase activity (33Tsaneva I.R. Muller B. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 34Tsaneva I.R. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26552-26558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We used a similar strand-displacement assay to assess the helicase activity of the RuvAB branch migration complex (Fig. 3). Either T440 or T440T was used as a substrate. RuvAB could displace an oligo either in the presence (Fig. 3A) or absence (Fig. 3B) of a 3′-non-hybridized tail. However, the 3′-tail stimulated RuvAB-catalyzed strand displacement activity. Both RuvA and RuvB proteins were required for the strand displacement activity and the maximum activity was observed when the molar ratio of RuvA tetramer to RuvB hexamer was 1:1 (data not shown). These results coincided well with the initial studies of the helicase activity of the RuvAB complex (33Tsaneva I.R. Muller B. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 34Tsaneva I.R. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26552-26558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 3A 3′-non-hybridized tail stimulates RuvAB-catalyzed strand displacement activity. The strand-displacement assay was performed using either T440T (A) or T440 (B) as a substrate. Reaction mixtures containing 10 fmol of the partial duplex DNA and indicated amounts (as RuvA tetramer·RuvB hexamer complex) were incubated and DNA products were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lanes 1 and 2 in both panels show intact and heat-denatured substrate, respectively. AB complex, the RuvAB complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Topo IV·Norfloxacin·DNA Ternary Complexes Do Not Inhibit the Translocation of RuvAB—The RuvAB branch migration complex plays an essential role during the late stage of homologous recombination to complete the process (14West S.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). DSBs generated by the quinolone treatment are repaired by the recombinational repair pathway (9Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). In addition, homologous recombination could be involved in the restart of a replication fork stalled by a topoisomerase·quinolone·DNA ternary complex (4Kogoma T. Cell. 1996; 85: 625-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 5Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2790-2796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, the RuvAB complex is likely to function on the DNA, where topoisomerase·quinolone·DNA ternary complexes are formed. The question was: What happens when a RuvAB complex collides with a topoisomerase·quinolone·DNA ternary complex during the branch migration? It is possible that the ternary complex could inhibit the translocation of RuvAB. A strand break could be generated as a result of the collision between a RuvAB complex and a topoisomerase· quinolone·DNA ternary complex. Another possibility is that RuvAB might somehow translocate through ternary complexes. To directly address this question, we assessed the effect of the Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complex on RuvAB (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complex does not block RuvAB translocation in vitro. The strand-displacement assay for RuvAB in the absence and presence of Topo IV and norfloxacin, as indicated, was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ten fmol of T440T was used as a substrate. RuvAB (as RuvA tetramer·RuvB hexamer complex) and Topo IV (as tetramer) were 50- and 30-fold molar excess over substrate, respectively, and norfloxacin was at 400 μm when present. DNA products were analyzed by either agarose (A) or polyacrylamide (B) gel electrophoresis. Lanes 1 and 2 in both panels show intact and heat-denatured substrate, respectively. AB complex, the RuvAB complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RuvAB could displace about 80% of the annealed oligo from T440T DNA under the conditions used (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Either norfloxacin alone or Topo IV alone did not affect RuvAB-catalyzed strand displacement activity (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast to the replicative helicases (28Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), formation of a Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complex did not inhibit the helicase activity of the RuvAB complex (Fig. 4A, lane 6). Displaced DNA fragments in the presence of ternary complexes were the intact 87-nt oligo (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that collisions between RuvAB and Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complexes did not generate any strand breaks at ternary complexes. These results showed that Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complexes did not block the passage of the RuvAB branch migration complex. Similar results were obtained when T440 DNA was used as a substrate (data not shown). These results suggested that RuvAB could promote the branch migration reaction in the presence of topoisomerase·quinolone·DNA ternary complexes.RuvAB Reverses Topo IV·Norfloxacin·DNA Ternary Complexes—To displace the intact oligo from the partial duplex DNA, RuvAB must reverse a Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complex and displace it from the DNA. If this were the case, the extent of norfloxacin-induced, Topo IV-catalyzed cleavage of T440T DNA would decrease, as RuvAB would unwind the duplex DNA and displace the annealed oligo. To directly examine this possibility, time courses of RuvAB-catalyzed strand displacement (Fig. 5) and norfloxacin-induced, Topo IV-catalyzed cleavage (Fig. 6) were measured simultaneously.Fig. 5Time course of RuvAB-catalyzed helicase activity.A, a time course of RuvAB-catalyzed helicase activity was measured in the absence or presence of Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complexes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” T440T was used as a substrate. RuvAB (as RuvA tetramer-RuvB hexamer complex) was 50-fold molar excess over substrate. Topo IV (as tetramer) and norfloxacin were 30-fold molar excess over substrate and at 400 μm, respectively, when present. B, the amounts of the displaced oligo, in the absence (closed circle) or presence (open circle) of Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complexes, at indicated times were quantitated using a PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6RuvAB can displace Topo IV·norfloxacin·DNA ternary complexes.A, a time course of Topo IV-catalyzed cleavage of the T440T DNA was measured in the absence or presence of RuvAB as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thirty-fold molar excess over substrate of Topo IV (as tetramer) and 400 μm norfloxacin were present.
