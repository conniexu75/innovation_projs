https://openalex.org/W4224016686,"Abstract The functions of the tumor microenvironment (TME) are orchestrated by precise spatial organization of specialized cells, yet little is known about the multicellular structures that form within the TME. Here we systematically mapped TME structures in situ using imaging mass cytometry and multitiered spatial analysis of 693 breast tumors linked to genomic and clinical data. We identified ten recurrent TME structures that varied by vascular content, stromal quiescence versus activation, and leukocyte composition. These TME structures had distinct enrichment patterns among breast cancer subtypes, and some were associated with genomic profiles indicative of immune escape. Regulatory and dysfunctional T cells co-occurred in large ‘suppressed expansion’ structures. These structures were characterized by high cellular diversity, proliferating cells and enrichment for BRCA1 and CASP8 mutations and predicted poor outcome in estrogen-receptor-positive disease. The multicellular structures revealed here link conserved spatial organization to local TME function and could improve patient stratification."

For the ongoing Veterans Affairs Genomic Medicine at Veterans Affairs (GenoVA) Study we developed a clinical genotype array-based assay for six published PRS. We used data from 36,423 Mass General Brigham Biobank participants and adjustment for population structure to replicate known PRS-disease associations and published PRS thresholds for a disease odds ratio (OR) of 2 (ranging from 1.75 (95% CI: 1.57-1.95) for type 2 diabetes to 2.38 (95% CI: 2.07-2.73) for breast cancer). After confirming the high performance and robustness of the pipeline for use as a clinical assay for individual patients, we analyzed the first 227 prospective samples from the GenoVA Study and found that the frequency of PRS corresponding to published OR > 2 ranged from 13/227 (5.7%) for colorectal cancer to 23/150 (15.3%) for prostate cancer. In addition to the PRS laboratory report, we developed physician- and patient-oriented informational materials to support decision-making about PRS results. Our work illustrates the generalizable development of a clinical PRS assay for multiple conditions and the technical, reporting and clinical workflow challenges for implementing PRS information in the clinic."

The excessive use of these chemicals leads to the degradation of soil quality, health, as well as nutritional status. These are also causing a degradation of human health. This experiment was conducted during Mrig Bahar (July to December) during two consecutive years (2019–2020)in a randomized block design with three replications in which six-year-old 42 pomegranate plants were tested with 14 treatments of different organic manures. Findings showed that in the various treatments, the organic combination T 13 -Jeevamrut 16.08 L plant -1 + Vermicompost 24.79 kg plant -1 had a significant effect on the nutritional status (available nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium) and microbial population (fungi, bacterial, and actinomycetes count). In addition, T 13 - Jeevamrut 16.08 L plant -1 + Vermicompost 24.79 kg plant -1 found a significant effect on fruit yield characteristics like fruit plant -1 (122.00), fruit yield (17.38 kg plant -1 ), fruit weight (192.50 g) and fruit quality characteristics such as fruit juice percent (52.92%), and total sugar (11.92%)."

Moreover, exchange rate, urbanization, household consumption, per capita income and renewable energy per capita were also essential factors in determining sustainable development. The sample consists of 64 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries from 2003–2018. The outcomes of the two-step system GMM confirmed the statistically significant and positive dynamic nature of sustainable development and its relationship with tourism and other determinants at a significance level of 1% for BRI countries. Institutional quality enhanced the 4.693% sustainability path to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) agenda with regionally interconnected countries at significance level of 1%. Renewable energy per-capita and income per-capita played a significant and positive role, while the exchange rate, household consumption, and urbanization negatively influenced by hurting thd path of sustainable development. The current research findings have valuable contributions to academics as it offers novel insights about the 0. 351% influence of tourism on sustainable development at significance level of 1%, and it proposes valued suggestions to policymakers concerning tourism development strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4229369004,"Fluid shear stress is an important mediator of vascular permeability, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of shear on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) have yet to be clarified in cerebral vasculature despite its importance for brain homeostasis. The goal of this study is to probe components of shear mechanotransduction within the BBB to gain a better understanding of pathologies associated with changes in cerebral perfusion including ischemic stroke. Interrogating the effects of shear stress in vivo is complicated by the complexity of factors in the brain parenchyma and the difficulty associated with modulating blood flow regimes. The in vitro model used in this study is compatible with real-time measurement of barrier function using a transendothelial electrical resistance as well as immunocytochemistry and dextran permeability assays. These experiments reveal that there is a threshold level of shear stress required for barrier formation and that the composition of the extracellular matrix, specifically the presence of high molecular weight hyaluronan, dictates the flow response. Gene editing to modulate the expression of CD44, a mechanosensitive receptor for hyaluronan, demonstrates that the receptor is required for the endothelial response to shear stress. Manipulation of small GTPase activity reveals CD44 activates Rac1 while inhibiting RhoA activation. Additionally, adducin-γ localizes to tight junctions in response to shear stress and RhoA inhibition and is required to maintain the barrier. This study identifies specific components of the mechanosensing complex associated with the BBB response to fluid shear stress and, therefore, illuminates potential targets for barrier manipulation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4224227740,"The serine proteases neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3), cathepsin G (CatG), and neutrophil serine protease 4 (NSP4) are secreted by activated neutrophils as a part of the innate immune response against invading pathogens. However, these serine proteases might be adopted by viruses to mediate viral surface protein priming resulting in host cell entrance and productive infection. Indeed, NE and PR3 hydrolyze the scissile peptide bond within the proteolytically sensitive polybasic sequence of the activation loop of SARS-CoV-2 located at the S1/S2 interface of the Spike (S) protein; an amino acid motif which differs from SARS-CoV-1. The occurrence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants and substitution of distinct amino acids at the polybasic sequence prompts serious concerns regarding increased transmissibility. We propose that a novel cleavage site by CatG of the Omicron variant and the increased substrate turnover of the Delta variant by furin within the polybasic sequence should be considered for increased transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants."
https://openalex.org/W4224247748,"Soil salinity is a major land degradation process reducing biological productivity in arid and semi-arid regions. Therefore, its effective monitoring and management is inevitable. Recent developments in remote sensing technology have made it possible to accurately identify and effectively monitor soil salinity. Hence, this study determined salinity levels of surface soils in 2650 ha agricultural and natural pastureland located in an arid region of central Anatolia, Turkey. The relationship between electrical conductivity (EC) values of 145 soil samples and the dataset created using Landsat 5 TM satellite image was investigated. Remote sensing dataset for 23 variables, including visible, near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral ranges, salinity, and vegetation indices were created. The highest correlation between EC values and remote sensing dataset was obtained in SWIR1 band (r = -0.43). Linear regression analysis was used to reveal the relationship between six bands and indices selected from the variables with the highest correlations. Coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.19) results indicated that models obtained using satellite image did not provide reliable results in determining soil salinity. Microtopography is the major factor affecting spatial distribution of soil salinity and caused heterogeneous distribution of salts on surface soils. Differences in salt content of soils caused heterogeneous distribution of halophytes and led to spectral complexity. The dark colored slickpots in small-scale depressions are common features of sodic soils, which are responsible for spectral complexity. In addition, low spatial resolution of Landsat 5 TM images is another reason decreasing the reliability of models in determining soil salinity."
https://openalex.org/W4224253757,"Several studies in the past have reported positive correlations between circulating Serum amyloid A (SAA) levels and obesity. However, based on limited number of studies involving appropriate mouse models, the role of SAA in the development of obesity and obesity-related metabolic consequences has not been established. Accordingly, herein, we have examined the role of SAA in the development of obesity and its associated metabolic complications in vivo using mice deficient for all three inducible forms of SAA: SAA1.1, SAA2.1 and SAA3 (TKO). Male and female mice were rendered obese by feeding a high fat, high sucrose diet with added cholesterol (HFHSC) and control mice were fed rodent chow diet. Here, we show that the deletion of SAA does not affect diet-induced obesity, hepatic lipid metabolism or adipose tissue inflammation. However, there was a modest effect on glucose metabolism. The results of this study confirm previous findings that SAA levels are elevated in adipose tissues as well as in the circulation in diet-induced obese mice. However, the three acute phase SAAs do not play a causative role in the development of obesity or obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation and dyslipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W4224215435,"Background The general self-rated health (SRH) question is the most common health measure employed in large population surveys. This study contributes to research on the concurrent validity of SRH using representative data with biomarkers from the Czech Republic, a population not previously used to assess the SRH measure. This work determines the relative contribution of biomedical and social characteristics to an individual’s SRH assessment. Studies have already explored the associations between SRH and markers of physical health. However, according to a PubMed systematic literature search, the issue of the relative importance of physiological and psychosocial factors that affect individuals’ assessments of their SRH has generally been neglected. Methodology/Principal findings Using data from a specialized epidemiological survey of the Czech population (N = 1021), this study adopted ordinary least squares regression to analyze the extent to which variance in SRH is explained by biomedical measures, mental health, health behavior, and socioeconomic characteristics. This analysis showed that SRH variance can be largely attributed to biomedical and psychological measures. Socioeconomic characteristics (i.e. marital status, education, economic activity, and household income) contributed to around 5% of the total variance. After controlling for age, sex, location, and socioeconomic status, biomarkers (i.e. C-reactive protein, blood glucose, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein), number of medical conditions, and current medications explained 11% of the total SRH variance. Mental health indicators contributed to an additional 9% of the variance. Body mass index and health behaviors (i.e. smoking and alcohol consumption) explained less than 2% of the variance. Conclusions/Significance The results suggested that SRH was a valid measure of physiological and mental health in the Czech sample, and the observed differences were likely to have reflected inequalities in bodily and mental functions between social groups."
https://openalex.org/W4224256325,"Invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILC) is characterized by proliferative indolence and long-term latency relapses. This study aimed to identify how disseminating ILC cells control the balance between quiescence and cell cycle re-entry. In the absence of anchorage, ILC cells undergo a sustained cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 while maintaining viability. From the genes that are upregulated in anchorage independent ILC cells, we selected Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2), a mediator of cell cycle progression. Using loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that Id2 is essential for anchorage independent survival (anoikis resistance) in vitro and lung colonization in mice. Importantly, we find that under anchorage independent conditions, E-cadherin loss promotes expression of Id2 in multiple mouse and (organotypic) human models of ILC, an event that is caused by a direct p120-catenin/Kaiso-dependent transcriptional de-repression of the canonical Kaiso binding sequence TCCTGCNA. Conversely, stable inducible restoration of E-cadherin expression in the ILC cell line SUM44PE inhibits Id2 expression and anoikis resistance. We show evidence that Id2 accumulates in the cytosol, where it induces a sustained and CDK4/6-dependent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through interaction with hypo-phosphorylated Rb. Finally, we find that Id2 is indeed enriched in ILC when compared to other breast cancers, and confirm cytosolic Id2 protein expression in primary ILC samples. In sum, we have linked mutational inactivation of E-cadherin to direct inhibition of cell cycle progression. Our work indicates that loss of E-cadherin and subsequent expression of Id2 drive indolence and dissemination of ILC. As such, E-cadherin and Id2 are promising candidates to stratify low and intermediate grade invasive breast cancers for the use of clinical cell cycle intervention drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4225985335,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, was identified in late 2019 and caused &gt;5 million deaths by February 2022. To date, targeted antiviral interventions against COVID-19 are limited. The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic to fatal disease. However, the reasons for varying outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection are yet to be elucidated. Here we show that an endogenously activated interferon lambda (IFNλ1) pathway leads to resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell (WD-PNEC) culture model derived from multiple adult donors, we discovered that susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, varied. One of four donors was resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. High baseline IFNλ1 expression levels and associated interferon stimulated genes correlated with resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway in WD-PNECs with high endogenous IFNλ1 secretion resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 titres. Conversely, prophylactic IFNλ treatment of WD-PNECs susceptible to infection resulted in reduced viral titres. An endogenously activated IFNλ response, possibly due to genetic differences, may be one explanation for the differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Importantly, our work supports the continued exploration of IFNλ as a potential pharmaceutical against SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4224010140,"Activated Cdc42-associated kinase (ACK) is an oncogenic nonreceptor tyrosine kinase associated with poor prognosis in several human cancers. ACK promotes proliferation, in part by contributing to the activation of Akt, the major effector of class 1A phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which transduce signals via membrane phosphoinositol lipids. We now show that ACK also interacts with other key components of class 1A PI3K signaling, the PI3K regulatory subunits. We demonstrate ACK binds to all five PI3K regulatory subunit isoforms and directly phosphorylates p85α, p85β, p50α, and p55α on Tyr607 (or analogous residues). We found that phosphorylation of p85β promotes cell proliferation in HEK293T cells. We demonstrate that ACK interacts with p85α exclusively in nuclear-enriched cell fractions, where p85α phosphorylated at Tyr607 (pTyr607) also resides, and identify an interaction between pTyr607 and the N-terminal SH2 domain that supports dimerization of the regulatory subunits. We infer from this that ACK targets p110-independent p85 and further postulate that these regulatory subunit dimers undertake novel nuclear functions underpinning ACK activity. We conclude that these dimers represent a previously undescribed mode of regulation for the class1A PI3K regulatory subunits and potentially reveal additional avenues for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4225486989,"Maintenance drugs are used to treat chronic conditions. Several classes of maintenance drugs have attracted attention because of their potential to affect susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19.Using claims data on 20% random sample of Part D Medicare enrollees from April to December 2020, we identified patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Using a nested case-control design, non-COVID-19 controls were identified by 1:5 matching on age, race, sex, dual-eligibility status, and geographical region. We identified usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), statins, warfarin, direct factor Xa inhibitors, P2Y12 inhibitors, famotidine and hydroxychloroquine based on Medicare prescription claims data. Using extended Cox regression models with time-varying propensity score adjustment we examined the independent effect of each study drug on contracting COVID-19. For severity of COVID-19, we performed extended Cox regressions on all COVID-19 patients, using COVID-19-related hospitalization and all-cause mortality as outcomes. Covariates included gender, age, race, geographic region, low-income indicator, and co-morbidities. To compensate for indication bias related to the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19, we censored patients who only started on hydroxychloroquine in 2020.Up to December 2020, our sample contained 374,229 Medicare patients over 65 who were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among the COVID-19 patients, 278,912 (74.6%) were on at least one study drug. The three most common study drugs among COVID-19 patients were statins 187,374 (50.1%), ACEI 97,843 (26.2%) and ARB 83,290 (22.3%). For all three outcomes (diagnosis, hospitalization and death), current users of ACEI, ARB, statins, warfarin, direct factor Xa inhibitors and P2Y12 inhibitors were associated with reduced risks, compared to never users. Famotidine did not show consistent significant effects. Hydroxychloroquine did not show significant effects after censoring of recent starters.Maintenance use of ACEI, ARB, warfarin, statins, direct factor Xa inhibitors and P2Y12 inhibitors was associated with reduction in risk of acquiring COVID-19 and dying from it."
https://openalex.org/W4224036302,"Resolution of inflammation is an active process that is tightly regulated to achieve repair and tissue homeostasis. In the absence of resolution, persistent inflammation underlies the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with recurrent exacerbations. Over the course of inflammation, macrophage programming transitions from pro-inflammatory to pro-resolving, which is in part regulated by the nuclear receptor Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ (PPARγ). Our previous work demonstrated an association between Fatty Acid Binding Protein 5 (FABP5) expression and PPARγ activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy and COPD patients. However, a role for FABP5 in macrophage programming has not been examined. Here, using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that FABP5 is necessary for PPARγ activation. In turn, PPARγ acts directly to increase FABP5 expression in primary human alveolar macrophages. We further illustrate that lack of FABP5 expression promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage programming with increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased chromatin accessibility for pro-inflammatory transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB and MAPK). And finally, real-time cell metabolic analysis using the Seahorse technology shows an inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in FABP5-deficient macrophages. Taken together, our data indicate that FABP5 and PPARγ reciprocally regulate each other's expression and function, consistent with a novel positive feedback loop between the two factors that mediates macrophage pro-resolving programming. Our studies highlight the importance of defining targets and regulatory mechanisms that control the resolution of inflammation and may serve to inform novel interventional strategies directed towards COPD."
https://openalex.org/W4224247332,"Simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers and secondary metabolite composition were used in combination to study seven varieties of citrus for the first time. With reference to established accessions of citrus, two of the varieties (Chanh Giay and Ma Nao Pan) were predicted to be Mexican key limes, while three were mandarin hybrids (Nagpur, Pontianak and Dalandan) and the remaining two (Qicheng and Mosambi) were related to the sweet orange. Notably, Dalandan was genetically more like a mandarin despite often referred to as an orange locally, whereas Mosambi was more likely to be a sweet orange hybrid although it has also been called a sweet lime due to its green peel and small size. Several key secondary metabolites such as polymethoxyflavones (sinensetin, tangeretin etc.), furanocoumarins (bergapten, citropten etc.) and volatiles (citronellol, α-sinensal etc.) were identified to be potential biomarkers for separation of citrus species. However, despite having similar genetic profiles, variations in the volatile profile of the two limes were observed; similarly, there were differences in the secondary metabolite profiles of the three mandarin hybrids despite having a common ancestral parent, highlighting the usefulness of genetic and compositional analyses in combination for revealing both origins and flavour profiles especially in citrus hybrids. This knowledge would be crucial for variety screening and selection for use in flavour or fragrance creation and application."
https://openalex.org/W4224008869,"The two major pathways of DNA double-strand break repair, nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination, are highly conserved from yeast to mammals. The regulation of 5'-DNA resection controls repair pathway choice and influences repair outcomes. Nej1 was first identified as a canonical NHEJ factor involved in stimulating the ligation of broken DNA ends, and more recently, it was shown to participate in DNA end-bridging and in the inhibition of 5'-resection mediated by the nuclease/helicase complex Dna2-Sgs1. Here, we show that Nej1 interacts with Sae2 to impact DSB repair in three ways. First, we show that Nej1 inhibits interaction of Sae2 with the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex and Sae2 localization to DSBs. Second, we found that Nej1 inhibits Sae2-dependent recruitment of Dna2 independently of Sgs1. Third, we determined that NEJ1 and SAE2 showed an epistatic relationship for end-bridging, an event that restrains broken DNA ends and reduces the frequency of genomic deletions from developing at the break site. Finally, we demonstrate that deletion of NEJ1 suppressed the synthetic lethality of sae2Δ sgs1Δ mutants, and that triple mutant viability was dependent on Dna2 nuclease activity. Taken together, these findings provide mechanistic insight to how Nej1 functionality inhibits the initiation of DNA resection, a role that is distinct from its involvement in end-joining repair at DSBs."
https://openalex.org/W4224081812,"The EtfAB components of two bifurcating flavoprotein systems, the crotonyl-CoA-dependent NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase from the bacterium Megasphaera elsdenii and the menaquinone-dependent NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase from the archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum, have been investigated. With both proteins, we find that removal of the electron-transferring flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) moiety from both proteins results in an uncrossing of the reduction potentials of the remaining bifurcating FAD; this significantly stabilizes the otherwise very unstable semiquinone state, which accumulates over the course of reductive titrations with sodium dithionite. Furthermore, reduction of both EtfABs depleted of their electron-transferring FAD by NADH was monophasic with a hyperbolic dependence of reaction rate on the concentration of NADH. On the other hand, NADH reduction of the replete proteins containing the electron-transferring FAD was multiphasic, consisting of a fast phase comparable to that seen with the depleted proteins followed by an intermediate phase that involves significant accumulation of FAD⋅-, again reflecting uncrossing of the half-potentials of the bifurcating FAD. This is then followed by a slow phase that represents the slow reduction of the electron-transferring FAD to FADH-, with reduction of the now fully reoxidized bifurcating FAD by a second equivalent of NADH. We suggest that the crossing and uncrossing of the reduction half-potentials of the bifurcating FAD is due to specific conformational changes that have been structurally characterized."
https://openalex.org/W4224272873,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are proteins or protein-domains that do not have a single native structure, rather, they are a class of flexible peptides that can rapidly adopt multiple conformations. IDPs are quite abundant, and their dynamic characteristics provide unique advantages for various biological processes. The field of “unstructured biology” has emerged, in part, because of numerous computational studies that had identified the unique characteristics of IDPs and IDRs. The package ‘ idpr ’, short for I ntrinsically D isordered P roteins in R , implements several R functions that match the established characteristics of IDPs to protein sequences of interest. This includes calculations of residue composition, charge-hydropathy relationships, and predictions of intrinsic disorder. Additionally, idpr integrates several amino acid substitution matrices and calculators to supplement IDP-based workflows. Overall, idpr aims to integrate tools for the computational analysis of IDPs within R, facilitating the analysis of these important, yet under-characterized, proteins.

https://openalex.org/W4225583223,"PLK1 and Smad4 are two important factors in prostate cancer initiation and progression. They have been reported to play the opposite role in Pten-deleted mice, one is an oncogene, the other is a tumor suppressor. Moreover, they could reversely regulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and the activation of MYC. However, the connections between PLK1 and Smad4 have never been studied. Here, we showed that PLK1 could interact with Smad4 and promote the ubiquitination and degradation of Smad4 in PCa cells. PLK1 and PELO could bind to different domains of Smad4 and formed a protein complex. PELO facilitated the degradation of Smad4 through cooperating with PLK1, thereby resulting in proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer cell. Changes in protein levels of Smad4 led to the alteration of biological function that caused by PLK1 in prostate cancer cells. Further studies showed that PELO upregulation was positively associated with high grade PCa and knockdown of PELO expression significantly decreased PCa cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and vivo. PELO knockdown in PCa cells could enhance the tumor suppressive role of PLK1 inhibitor. In addition, blocking the interaction between PELO and Smad4 by using specific peptide could effectively inhibit PCa cell metastasis ability in vitro and vivo. Overall, these findings identified a novel regulatory relationship among PLK1, Smad4 and PELO, and provided a potential therapeutic strategy for advanced PCa therapy by co-targeting PLK1 and PELO."
https://openalex.org/W4224239989,"Paracetamol is widely used to manage fever and pain during pregnancy worldwide. However, paracetamol may affect the pregnant woman and fetus, once this drug crosses the placental barrier after therapeutic doses and may impair fetal liver function, affecting fetus growth and development. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between paracetamol use during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes as preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age.Data from 760 pregnant women within the NISAMI Cohort between June 2012 and February 2014 were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association among paracetamol use during pregnancy and preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age. Multivariate analyses were adjusted for socioeconomic, maternal, pregnancy, and newborn covariates. Around 14% of women were exposed to paracetamol during pregnancy. A decrease in paracetamol use throughout pregnancy was observed. Lower risk of low birth weight in infants born to women exposed to the drug (OR 0.21; IC 95% 0.01-0.99) was found. Paracetamol use during pregnancy was not statistically associated with preterm birth or small for gestational age.The findings of this study do not suggest an increased risk of perinatal outcomes. However, it should not be assumed that paracetamol is a risk-free medication and its use must be rational."
https://openalex.org/W4224291371,"To raise biodiversity awareness effectively, communicators should be aware of knowledge levels in their audiences. Species identification skills have been used in the past as a measure of what people know about species, yet it is not known whether they serve as good indicators. To study the link between species identification and in-depth species knowledge, we presented an animal knowledge test to an online audience of over 7,000 Dutch adults, and used correlation and regression analyses to determine the extent to which species identification predicts in-depth knowledge about species' origin, habitat, diet, and behavior. We found that in-depth knowledge was higher in those who correctly identified species as compared with those who did not correctly identify species, for all four types of in-depth knowledge. Moreover, as compared to alternative variables (work, age, gender, and educational level), species identification was by far the best predictor for in-depth knowledge about species. However, species identification levels were generally higher than levels of in-depth knowledge, and knowledge gaps and misconceptions were uncovered. The results confirm the value of species identification tests, but also highlight limitations and challenges that should be taken into account when establishing knowledge levels and communicating biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W4223930703,"In metazoans, the architecture of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) differs between cell types and undergoes major changes throughout the cell cycle and according to physiological needs. Although much is known about how the different ER morphologies are generated and maintained, especially ER tubules, how context-dependent changes in ER shape and distribution are regulated and the factors involved are less well characterized, as are the factors that contribute to the positioning of the ER within the cell. By overexpression and KO experiments, we show that the levels of RHBDL4, an ER-resident rhomboid protease, modulate the shape and distribution of the ER, especially during conditions that require rapid changes in the ER sheet distribution, such as ER stress. We demonstrate that RHBDL4 interacts with cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein 63 (CLIMP-63), a protein involved in ER sheet stabilization, as well as with the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, we found that mice lacking RHBDL4 are sensitive to ER stress and develop liver steatosis, a phenotype associated with unresolved ER stress. Taken together, these data suggest a new physiological role for RHBDL4 and also imply that this function does not require its enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W4224095348,"The transition of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts is a crucial step in kidney fibrosis. However, the biological processes involved in this transdifferentiation are incompletely understood. In this study, we discovered that the midbody plays a role in the fibroblast-myofibroblast transition by mediating TGF-β/Smad signaling. Combining bulk RNA-seq, histology, and the western blot of unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys, we demonstrated that the pathway related to microtubules is implicated in kidney fibrosis, and the blocking of microtubule dynamics by colchicine improved kidney fibrosis. Subsequently, to explore microtubule-based organelles in detail, we cultured NRK-49F (rat kidney fibroblast cell line) and HKC-8 (human proximal tubule cell line) under transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) stimulation, which caused deciliation in both cell lines during epithelial-mesenchymal and fibroblast-myofibroblast transition. We identified another microtubule-based organelle, the midbody, whose formation is promoted by TGF-β1 in fibroblasts as a result of proliferation in contrast to tubular cells. Notably, TGF-β receptors were present in the midbody of both cell lines. In TGF-β1-treated fibroblasts, colchicine or Hedgehog pathway inhibitor 4 impaired the midbody formation, and attenuated the upregulation of canonical TGF-β/Smad signaling and α-SMA expression. These findings offer novel insight into the midbody as an active organelle involved in fibroblast-myofibroblast transition by mediating TGF-β/Smad signaling, which could be a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W4224210955,"Introduction The automatic classification of lymphoma lesions in PET is a main topic of ongoing research. An automatic algorithm would enable the swift evaluation of PET parameters, like texture and heterogeneity markers, concerning their prognostic value for patients outcome in large datasets. Moreover, the determination of the metabolic tumor volume would be facilitated. The aim of our study was the development and evaluation of an automatic algorithm for segmentation and classification of lymphoma lesions in PET. Methods Pre-treatment PET scans from 60 Hodgkin lymphoma patients from the EuroNet-PHL-C1 trial were evaluated. A watershed algorithm was used for segmentation. For standardization of the scan length, an automatic cropping algorithm was developed. All segmented volumes were manually classified into one of 14 categories. The random forest method and a nested cross-validation was used for automatic classification and evaluation. Results Overall, 853 volumes were segmented and classified. 203/246 tumor lesions and 554/607 non-tumor volumes were classified correctly by the automatic algorithm, corresponding to a sensitivity, a specificity, a positive and a negative predictive value of 83%, 91%, 79% and 93%. In 44/60 (73%) patients, all tumor lesions were correctly classified. In ten out of the 16 patients with misclassified tumor lesions, only one false-negative tumor lesion occurred. The automatic classification of focal gastrointestinal uptake, brown fat tissue and composed volumes consisting of more than one tissue was challenging. Conclusion Our algorithm, trained on a small number of patients and on PET information only, showed a good performance and is suitable for automatic lymphoma classification."
https://openalex.org/W4224215744,"Given a pre-trained BERT, how can we compress it to a fast and lightweight one while maintaining its accuracy? Pre-training language model, such as BERT, is effective for improving the performance of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, heavy models like BERT have problems of large memory cost and long inference time. In this paper, we propose SensiMix (Sensitivity-Aware Mixed Precision Quantization), a novel quantization-based BERT compression method that considers the sensitivity of different modules of BERT. SensiMix effectively applies 8-bit index quantization and 1-bit value quantization to the sensitive and insensitive parts of BERT, maximizing the compression rate while minimizing the accuracy drop. We also propose three novel 1-bit training methods to minimize the accuracy drop: Absolute Binary Weight Regularization, Prioritized Training, and Inverse Layer-wise Fine-tuning. Moreover, for fast inference, we apply FP16 general matrix multiplication (GEMM) and XNOR-Count GEMM for 8-bit and 1-bit quantization parts of the model, respectively. Experiments on four GLUE downstream tasks show that SensiMix compresses the original BERT model to an equally effective but lightweight one, reducing the model size by a factor of 8× and shrinking the inference time by around 80% without noticeable accuracy drop."
https://openalex.org/W4224236060,"Background Fluctuating course of delirium and complexities of ICU care mean delirium symptoms are hard to identify or commonly confused with other disorders. Delirium is difficult to diagnose, and clinicians and researchers may combine assessments from multiple tools. We evaluated diagnostic accuracy of different combinations of delirium assessments performed in each enrolled patient. Methods Data were obtained from a previously conducted cross-sectional study. Eligible adult patients who remained admitted to ICU for &gt;24 hours with at least one family member present were consecutively enrolled as patient-family dyads. Clinical delirium assessments (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist [ICSDC] and Confusion Assessment Method-ICU [CAM-ICU]) were completed twice daily by bedside nurse or trained research assistant, respectively. Family delirium assessments (Family Confusion Assessment Method and Sour Seven) were completed once daily by family members. We pooled all delirium assessment tools in a single two-class latent model and pairwise (i.e., combined, clinical or family assessments) Bayesian analyses. Results Seventy-three patient-family dyads were included. Among clinical delirium assessments, the ICDSC had lower sensitivity (0.72; 95% Bayesian Credible [BC] interval 0.54–0.92) and higher specificity (0.90; 95%BC, 0.82–0.97) using Bayesian analyses compared to pooled latent class analysis and CAM-ICU had higher sensitivity (0.90; 95%BC, 0.70–1.00) and higher specificity (0.94; 95%BC, 0.80–1.00). Among family delirium assessments, the Family Confusion Assessment Method had higher sensitivity (0.83; 95%BC, 0.71–0.92) and higher specificity (0.93; 95%BC, 0.84–0.98) using Bayesian analyses compared to pooled latent class analysis and the Sour Seven had higher specificity (0.85; 95%BC, 0.67–0.99) but lower sensitivity (0.64; 95%BC 0.47–0.82). Conclusions Results from delirium assessment tools are often combined owing to imperfect reference standards for delirium measurement. Pairwise Bayesian analyses that explicitly accounted for each tool’s (performed within same patient) prior sensitivity and specificity indicate that two combined clinical or two combined family delirium assessment tools have fair diagnostic accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4224305072,"Action observation (AO) and motor imagery (MI) are used for the rehabilitation of patients who face difficulty walking. Rehabilitation involving AO, MI, and AO combined with MI (AO+MI) facilitates gait recovery after neurological disorders. However, the mechanism by which it positively affects gait function is unclear. We previously examined the neural mechanisms underlying AO and MI of walking, focusing on AO+MI and corticospinal and spinal motor neuron excitability, which play important roles in gait function. Herein, we investigated the effects of a short intervention using AO+MI of walking on the corticospinal and spinal motor neuron excitability and MI ability of participants. Twelve healthy individuals participated in this study, which consisted of a 20 min intervention. Before the experiment, we measured MI ability using the Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire-2 (VMIQ-2). We used motor evoked potential and F-wave measurements to evaluate the corticospinal and spinal motor neuron excitability at rest, pre-intervention, 0 min, and 15 min post-intervention. We also measured corticospinal excitability during MI of walking and the participant’s ability to perform MI using a visual analog scale (VAS). There were no significant changes in corticospinal and spinal motor neuron excitability during and after the intervention using AO+MI (p&gt;0.05). The intervention temporarily increased VAS scores, thus indicating clearer MI (p&lt;0.05); however, it did not influence corticospinal excitability during MI of walking (p&gt;0.05). Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between the VMIQ-2 and VAS scores and changes in corticospinal and spinal motor neuron excitability. Therefore, one short intervention using AO+MI increased MI ability in healthy individuals; however, it was insufficient to induce plastic changes at the cortical and spinal levels. Moreover, the effects of intervention using AO+MI were not associated with MI ability. Our findings provide information about intervention using AO+MI in healthy individuals and might be helpful in planning neurorehabilitation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4224058396,"Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a member of AAA-ATPase superfamily involved in various cellular functions. To investigate the pathophysiological role of VCP in metabolic disorders, we generated knock-in mice bearing an A232E mutation in VCP, a known human VCP pathogenic variant. When heterozygous mutant mice (A232E/+) were fed a high-fat diet, we observed that fatty liver was ameliorated and the proteolytic processing of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) was impaired. Further co-immunoprecipitation analysis in wildtype mice revealed interactions of VCP with SREBP1 and a rhomboid protease, RHBDL4, in the liver, and these interactions were attenuated in A232E/+ mice. Consistent with these results, we show that knockdown or chemical inhibition of VCP or RHBDL4 in human hepatocytes impaired the proteolytic processing of SREBP1. Finally, we found that knockdown of E3 ligases such as glycoprotein 78 and HMG-CoA reductase degradation protein 1 disrupted the interaction of VCP with SREBP1 and impaired the proteolytic processing of SREBP1. These results suggest that VCP recognizes ubiquitinylated SREBP1 and recruits it to RHBDL4 to promote its proteolytic processing. The present study reveals a novel proteolytic processing pathway of SREBP1 and may lead to development of new therapeutic strategies to treat fatty liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4224230169,"Background To compare intravitreal aflibercept injection with intravitreal ranibizumab injection for the risk of major arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) and glaucoma. Methods This retrospective, nationwide cohort study investigated 15 611 and 3867 patients aged &gt;50 years with at least one pharmacy claim for intravitreal ranibizumab injection and aflibercept injection between 2011 and 2016, respectively. The inverse probability of treatment weighting method was performed to adjust the baseline difference between the two groups and the hazard risk of adverse events was estimated using the Cox proportional regression model. Results No significant difference was noted between intravitreal ranibizumab and aflibercept injection for arterial thromboembolic risk, including ischemic stroke and acute myocardial infarction, during a 2-year follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53–1.42; P = .583). Subgroup analyses revealed that patients age &gt;65 years (adjusted HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.45–0.92) and those without coronary artery disease (adjusted HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.37–0.95) had significantly lower arterial thromboembolic risk in the aflibercept group than in the ranibizumab group. Additionally, the risk of glaucoma development after intravitreal injection did not significantly differ between the two groups (adjusted HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.37–1.06; P = .084). Conclusions No significant differences in the risk of major ATEs and glaucoma were found between ranibizumab and aflibercept, and aflibercept might be safe for use in elderly patients."
https://openalex.org/W4224274530,"Laos, a mountainous and landlocked country located in Southeast Asia, has the highest percentage of people using insects as food in the world. Lao people obtain edible insects through harvesting in the natural environment and purchasing at food markets. There has been no comprehensive survey about sales of insects at food markets in the wider areas, and our understanding of sales of insects in Laos is limited. Our study aims to identify environmental factors affecting the sales and the diversity of edible insects sold at food markets in Laos. We visited 37 and 55 markets, during the dry and rainy seasons respectively, in northern Laos to record species of sold insects. We then analyzed the correlations between insect sales and three potential factors (seasons, provinces, and urbanization indices around the markets). There was no significant difference in the percentage of markets selling insects between in the dry and rainy seasons; 40–50% of the markets sold insects in both seasons. The composition of sold insects differed between in the dry and rainy seasons, which reflects the seasonality and life history of each insect species. There tended to be more groups of insects for sale in the Vientiane capital than in the other provinces in both seasons. This trend may reflect that it is more difficult to obtain edible insects through wild harvesting in highly urbanized Vientiane capital than in the other provinces, and the commercial demand for insects is increasing. This possibility is directly supported by the positive correlation between the urbanization index and the insect sales in the rainy season. Laos has recently undergone rapid urbanization, particularly in the Vientiane capital, and we predict that commercial demand for edible insects will be much higher in the Vientiane capital and the urbanized cities in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4224295180,"The middle trough serves as a key part of a scraper conveyor. During the working process, falling raw coal lands on the middle plate of the trough, causing impact damage. This study aims to find the optimal working condition combination to minimize impact damage to the middle trough based on the engineering discrete element method (EDEM) and orthogonal matrix analysis (OMA). In EDEM software, simulation data of the impact damage depth and normal cumulative contact energy of the middle trough corresponding to the four influencing factors of the transverse laying roll angle, front lean angle, raw coal particle size, and chain layout and spacing under different horizontal conditions are obtained. Matrices of the impact damage depth and normal cumulative contact energy are separately established. Based on the respective factor layer, level and evaluation index weight matrices, a global weight matrix is finally obtained. The optimal combination of working conditions is obtained, and the weight of each factor on impact damage to the middle trough is determined by the weight coefficient. The accuracy of the simulation results is then verified in experiments. Among the considered factors, the raw coal particle size achieves the highest impact damage coefficient. When the raw coal particle size is the smallest (0.5 times the basic particle size), the transverse roll angle and front lean angle of the middle trough are positive (5° and 10°, respectively), the chain adopts the double-center chain arrangement, and minimal impact damage to the middle trough occurs. OMA reduces the test times to determine the optimal working conditions of a scraper conveyor."
https://openalex.org/W4224297154,"Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects multiple neural pathways and regions, resulting in various visual impairments such as motion perception. Generally, gamma-band activities during visual motion perception have been thought to reflect ongoing cognitive processes. Nevertheless, few studies have specifically examined induced gamma band activity during visual motion perception in AD patients. Therefore, after performing magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording during apparent motion (AM) stimulation for the left hemi-visual field in patients diagnosed as having AD in the early stage, we compared the results with findings of cognitive performance. Methods Seventeen AD patients in the early stage and 17 controls matched for age, sex, and educational attainment participated in this study. For each participant, memory performance was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R). For MEG analysis, we examined power changes induced in a higher frequency range (20–100 Hz) after AM stimuli. Results The power of induced gamma band activities was significantly higher in AD patients. The power of induced gamma band activities was associated with higher performance on both MMSE and WMS-R tests for attention and concentration in AD patients. Conclusions Given that neuronal dysfunction in AD is associated with excitotoxic neurodegeneration, and given that subsequent development of compensatory inhibitory mechanisms also contributes to pathology in AD patients, elevated gamma band oscillations might reflect an imbalance of inhibitory and excitatory activity in AD patients. Moreover, positive correlation between induced gamma activity and cognitive performance might signify a compensating mechanism of inhibitory neurons which preserve the pyramidal neuron from excitotoxicity in a posterior association area."
https://openalex.org/W4225738763,"Modeling biochemical systems can provide insights into behaviors that are difficult to observe or understand. It requires software, programming, and understanding of the system to build a model and study it. Softwares exist for systems biology modeling, but most support only certain types of modeling tasks. Desirable features including ease in preparing input, symbolic or analytical computation, parameter estimation, graphical user interface, and systems biology markup language (SBML) support are not seen concurrently in one software package. In this study, we developed a python-based software that supports these features, with both deterministic and stochastic propagations. The software can be used by graphical user interface, command line, or as a python import. We also developed a semi-programmable and intuitively easy topology input method for the biochemical reactions. We tested the software with semantic and stochastic SBML test cases. Tests on symbolic solution and parameter estimation were also included. The software we developed is reliable, well performing, convenient to use, and compliant with most of the SBML tests. So far it is the only systems biology software that supports symbolic, deterministic, and stochastic modeling in one package that also features parameter estimation and SBML support. This work offers a comprehensive set of tools and allows for better availability and accessibility for studying kinetics and dynamics in biochemical systems."
https://openalex.org/W4223915141,"Previous studies have found that amphiregulin (AREG) may participate in eye elongation during the development of myopia, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we tested tear concentrations of AREG in adults and detected the role of AREG in scleral remodeling in form-deprivation myopia (FDM) in guinea pigs. We found the tear concentrations of AREG in myopes were significantly higher than those in emmetropes using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Tear concentrations of AREG were negatively correlated with spherical equivalent refraction and positively correlated with axial length (AL) and AL/corneal radii. We then used RNAi, DNA transfection and PD98059 treatments to determine the effects of AREG on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) in primary scleral fibroblasts (SFs). The hypothesis was further verified via loss- and gain-of-function experiments by intravitreal application of anti-AREG antibody (anti-AR) or AREG in form-deprivation eyes in guinea pigs. Immunofluorescence assay was used for cell type identification. Western-blot and q-PCR were used for the detection of relative expressions. Transmission electron microscopy was performed for posterior scleral observation. In vitro, we found AREG overexpression increased phospho-ERK1/2 and MMP-2 expression, while depletion of AREG inhibited their expressions. PD98059 (an effective ERK1/2 inhibitor) inhibited AREG-induced MMP-2 upregulation. In vivo, we found anti-AR treatments suppressed FDM by inhibiting scleral remodeling, while AREG treatments promoted FDM. Our results suggest that AREG in tear fluids can serve as a potential biomarker in myopes. AREG is involved in scleral remodeling through the ERK1/2-MMP-2 pathway. AREG is a potential target for myopia control."

To understand how Mkp-1 affects immune defense, we analyzed the RNA-Seq datasets previously generated from control and E. coli–infected Mkp-1+/+ and Mkp-1−/− mice. We found that E. coli infection markedly induced programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and that Mkp-1 deficiency further amplified PD-L1 expression. Administration of a PD-L1-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) to Mkp-1−/− mice increased the mortality of the animals following E. coli infection, although bacterial burden was decreased. In addition, the PD-L1-neutralizing mAb increased serum interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor alpha, as well as lung- and liver-inducible nitric oxide synthase levels, suggesting an enhanced inflammatory response. Interestingly, neutralization of IFN-α/β receptor 1 blocked PD-L1 induction in Mkp-1−/− mice following E. coli infection. PD-L1 was potently induced in macrophages by E. coli and lipopolysaccharide in vitro, and Mkp-1 deficiency exacerbated PD-L1 induction with little effect on the half-life of PD-L1 mRNA. In contrast, inhibitors of Janus kinase 1/2 and tyrosine kinase 2, as well as the IFN-α/β receptor 1–neutralizing mAb, markedly attenuated PD-L1 induction. These results suggest that the beneficial effect of type I IFNs in E. coli–infected Mkp-1−/− mice is, at least in part, mediated by Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription–driven PD-L1 induction.

Our studies also support the notion that enhanced PD-L1 expression contributes to the bactericidal defect of Mkp-1−/− mice. The immune defense against bacterial pathogens relies on a group of pattern recognition receptors to initiate an inflammatory response that leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. Innate immune recognition: Mechanisms and pathways.Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Activation of these pattern recognition receptors by the conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns, presented by the microbial pathogens, leads to a number of signal transduction cascades, such as the NF-κB, interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, resulting in the production of a variety of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and type I IFNs (1Medzhitov R.

Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. Garland Publishing, NY2001Google Scholar). These inflammatory cytokines can shape the development of adaptive immunity and influence the production of T-cell cytokines such as IFN-γ. The inflammatory cytokines can coordinate a multiarray of cellular programs to organize an effective immune defense against infections. For example, TNF-α and IFN-γ can induce the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to modulate the production of nitric oxide (NO) (3Salkowski C.A. Detore G. McNally R. van Rooijen N.

Previously, it has been reported that blockade of the immune checkpoint protein, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), enhances bacterial clearance, increases systemic inflammation, attenuates liver injury, and improves survival following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), an experimental model of sepsis (30Zhang Y. Zhou Y. Lou J. Li J. Bo L. Zhu K. Wan X. Deng X. Cai Z. PD-L1 blockade improves survival in experimental sepsis by inhibiting lymphocyte apoptosis and reversing monocyte dysfunction.Crit.

A clinical study also showed that PD-L1 levels correlate with increased mortality, nosocomial infection, and immune dysfunctions in septic shock patients (32Guignant C. Lepape A. Huang X. Kherouf H.

Care. 2013; 17: R85Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) demonstrated that neutralizing either PD-L1 or its receptor, programmed death-1 (PD-1), reverses sepsis-induced IFN-γ suppression, enhances major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression on antigen-presenting cells, and improves survival in primary and secondary fungal sepsis. In the present study, we found that PD-L1 was more robustly induced in multiple organs after E. coli infection in Mkp-1 KO mice than in WT mice. PD-L1 induction was almost completely blocked by an IFN-α/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1)–neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb), thus highlighting the critical role of type I IFN in PD-L1 induction. Interestingly, blockade of PD-L1 with a neutralizing mAb in E. coli–infected Mkp-1 KO mice decreased bacterial loads but enhanced inflammation and mortality. We found that Mkp-1 deficiency enhanced PD-L1 expression in macrophages upon E. coli stimulation without affecting PD-L1 mRNA stability. Finally, we showed that PD-L1 induction by E. coli or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of JAK1/2, tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), and IFNAR1-neutralizing mAb. These results suggest that Mkp-1 controls PD-L1 expression by inhibiting type I IFN production during systemic E. coli infection. These studies strongly support the notion that type I IFN–mediated PD-L1 induction acts as a protective mechanism during bloodstream E. coli infection. These studies also revealed both beneficial (prosurvival and anti-inflammatory) and detrimental (inhibition on bacterial clearance) actions of PD-L1 during bacterial sepsis. Previously, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on liver samples from PBS-treated control and E. coli–infected WT and Mkp-1 KO mice (26Borchers A. Pieler T. Programming pluripotent precursor cells derived from Xenopus embryos to generate specific tissues and organs.Genes (Basel). 2010; 1: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Examination of the same dataset revealed a 10.5-fold increase in PD-L1 mRNA levels in the livers of E. coli–infected WT mice over PBS-treated WT mice (Fig. 1A). While the levels of PD-L1 mRNA transcripts in PBS-treated Mkp-1−/− mice were similar to those of WT mice, E. coli infection in Mkp-1−/− mice resulted in a 120-fold increase in liver PD-L1 mRNA levels over PBS-treated Mkp-1−/− mice. The induction in PD-L1 mRNA by E. coli infection and the augmentation of PD-L1 mRNA induction by Mkp-1 deficiency was confirmed by quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR) (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis indicates that PD-L1 protein levels in the livers almost mirrored the PD-L1 mRNA expression patterns: a dramatic increase in PD-L1 protein in WT mice after E. coli infection and further augmentation with Mkp-1 deficiency (Fig. 1C). Quantitation of the PD-L1 protein levels from a large number of animals is shown in Figure 1D. To characterize PD-L1 protein expression in organs, we harvested the lung, liver, spleen, heart, and kidney from control and E. coli–infected WT and Mkp-1 KO mice 24 h postinfection and performed immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody (Ab) against mouse PD-L1 (Fig. 2). The immunoreactivity of the Ab was confirmed by the omission of the primary Ab in the negative controls (data not shown). The most interesting features of PD-L1 expression were present in the livers and spleens. In the livers, PD-L1 protein levels were very low in both WT and Mkp-1 KO mice without E. coli infection, although PD-L1 was occasionally detected on Kupffer cells (Fig. 2A, left columns). In WT mice, after E. coli infection, PD-L1 protein was detected on Kupffer cells, infiltrating mononuclear cells (monocytes), and sinusoid endothelial cells (Fig. 2A, upper row, central and right columns). In Mkp-1 KO mice, E. coli infection resulted in a strong expression of PD-L1 on Kupffer cells and sinusoid endothelial cells, particularly in the centrilobular to midzonal regions (Fig. 2A, lower row, central and right columns). Overall, markedly more PD-L1-positive cells were seen in the livers of E. coli–infected Mkp-1 KO mice than in those of E. coli–infected WT mice. To quantitate the expression of PD-L1 in liver cells, we perfused the livers of control and E. coli–infected mice with collagenase I and enriched hepatocytes and Kupffer cells through centrifugations. The Kupffer cell–enriched and hepatocyte-enriched cell populations were stained with cell type–specific markers (F4/80 for Kupffer cells and inflammatory macrophages (34Gordon S. Taylor P.R. Monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3674) Google Scholar) and asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 [ASGR1] for hepatocytes) to mark these cells and assess PD-L1 expression on these cell types (Fig. 2B). Approximately 7.5% of the F4/80+ cells (Q2 and Q3 quadrants) expressed detectable levels of PD-L1 in control WT mice, and the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of PD-L1 staining in all F4/80+ cells was low. Compared with control WT mice, a larger percentage of hepatic F4/80+ cells (17%) in control Mkp-1 KO mice expressed PD-L1, and the MFI of PD-L1 staining of hepatic F4/80+ cells was higher than that in control WT mice (155 ± 3 versus 285 ± 3, p < 0.05). E. coli infection markedly increased both the percentages of PD-L1-expressing cells and the MFI of PD-L1 staining in F4/80+ cells in both WT and Mkp-1 KO mice. Compared with E. coli–infected WT mice, both the percentage of PD-L1-expressing cells and the MFI of PD-L1 staining among the F4/80+ cells were higher in E. coli–infected Mkp-1 KO mice (40% versus 66%; MFI 646 ± 12 versus 1099 ± 16 [p < 0.05], respectively). However, flow cytometry analysis of ASGR1+ hepatocytes did not detect a marked difference in PD-L1 expression between WT and Mkp-1 KO mice or a convincing effect of E. coli infection on hepatocyte PD-L1 expression (data not shown). In the spleens of both WT and Mkp-1 KO mice treated with PBS, PD-L1 expression was most prominent in macrophages within the marginal zone of the white pulp (Fig. S1A, left column, insets) and to a lesser degree within the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (Fig. S1A). E. coli infection moderately increased PD-L1 expression within the white pulp marginal zone (Fig. S1A, central column, insets) and markedly enhanced PD-L1 expression in macrophages within the red pulp (Fig. S1A, right columns). Flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes indicated that PD-L1 was increased in F4/80+ macrophages upon E. coli infection in both WT and Mkp-1 KO mice (Fig. S1B). PD-L1 expression was slightly higher in splenic F4/80+ macrophages in Mkp-1 KO mice than in F4/80+ macrophages in WT mice (Fig. S1B). PD-L2 was slightly induced upon E. coli infection in splenic F4/80+ macrophages in Mkp-1 KO mice, although there was no significant difference of PD-L2 expression in F4/80+ macrophages between WT and Mkp-1 KO mice. PD-L1 expression was also increased in response to E. coli infection in splenic CD11c+ dendritic cells, and PD-L1 appeared slightly higher in Mkp-1−/− dendritic cells than in WT dendritic cells. In the heart, PD-L1 expression in the myocardium was very weak, although E. coli infection slightly enhanced PD-L1 expression in both WT and Mkp-1 KO mice (Fig. S2, left column). Moderate PD-L1 expression was variably seen in myocardial capillary endothelium in both E. coli–infected WT and Mkp-1 KO mice. In the lungs, PD-L1 was strongly expressed within the cell membranes of the majority of alveolar macrophages and mildly expressed in capillary and medium caliber vascular endothelium of PBS-treated WT and Mkp-1 KO mice (Fig. S2, central column). Upon E. coli infection, PD-L1 was strongly expressed in alveolar capillary endothelium, vascular endothelium, and monocytes adherent to the vascular endothelium (Fig. S2, central column). There were no overt differences in PD-L1 expression in either the lung or the heart between WT and Mkp-1 KO mice, either treated with PBS or infected with E. coli. Finally, weak PD-L1 expression was observed in the kidneys of both WT and Mkp-1 KO mice, particularly in basolateral membranes of tubular epithelium, Bowman’s capsular epithelium, and small artery endothelium (Fig. S2, right column). E. coli moderately enhanced the expression of PD-L1 in both groups of mice. The induction of PD-L1 in the kidneys of Mkp-1 KO mice appeared to be more robust than in WT mice. Previously, it has been reported that neutralizing PD-L1 improved bacterial clearance, increased TNF-α and IL-6, and decreased mortality in a CLP model of sepsis (30Zhang Y. Zhou Y. Lou J. Li J. Bo L. Zhu K. Wan X. Deng X. Cai Z. PD-L1 blockade improves survival in experimental sepsis by inhibiting lymphocyte apoptosis and reversing monocyte dysfunction.Crit. Care. 2010; 14: R220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To understand the function of PD-L1 during systemic E. coli infection in Mkp-1 KO mice, we analyzed the effect of PD-L1 neutralization in these mice. Mice were first given 100 μg PD-L1-neutralizing mAb or an isotype control mAb in the late afternoon and then infected with E. coli the following morning. The mice were monitored for 7 days to assess animal survival (Fig. 3A). Compared with mice that were given the isotype control mAb, mice administered the PD-L1-neutralizing mAb had significantly greater mortality (Fig. 3A). To characterize the effects of PD-L1 neutralization on the host immune responses, we harvested organs and blood from the mice 24 h postinfection to assess bacterial loads, cytokines, and tissue iNOS levels. Interestingly, we found that PD-L1 neutralization significantly decreased splenic bacterial load 24 h postinfection (Fig. 3B). However, the bacterial load in the blood was not significantly different between Mkp-1 KO mice treated with the PD-L1-neutralizing mAb and those that received isotype control mAb. Serum TNF-α levels in the Mkp-1−/− mice treated with the PD-L1-neutralizing Ab were higher at 24 h postinfection than mice that received isotype control mAb (Fig. 4A). Serum IFN-γ and granuclocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels in the Mkp-1−/− mice treated with the PD-L1-neutralizing mAb trended higher at 24 h postinfection than mice that received isotype control mAb, whereas IL-27 levels were not different. At 48 h post E. coli infection, serum IFN-γ levels in the Mkp-1−/− mice treated with the PD-L1-neutralizing mAb were higher than in mice that received isotype control mAb (Fig. 4B), whereas TNF-α, IL-27, and granuclocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels were similar in the two groups. NO is a potent bactericidal substance and a powerful vasodilator that has been implicated in both bacterial clearance, particularly for intracellular pathogens, and septic shock (35Parrillo J.E.

We found that iNOS expression in both the lungs and livers of Mkp-1−/− mice pretreated with PD-L1 mAb was significantly higher than in those organs of mice pretreated with the isotype control mAb (Fig. 5). We have previously reported that Mkp-1−/− mice produced a substantially greater amount of type I IFN than WT mice after systemic E. coli infection (27Kirk S.G. Murphy P.R. Wang X. Cash C.J.

It has been shown that both type I and type II IFNs can stimulate PD-L1 expression (38Xiao W. Klement J.D. Lu C. Ibrahim M.L. Liu K.

https://openalex.org/W4224241555,"Background Despite efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, Addis Ababa, the country’s COVID-19 epicenter, is experiencing a sharp increase in the number of cases and death rate. While poor public adherence to COVID-19 precautionary practices is evident, factors associated with it are not well studied. We aimed to assess the level of practice of COVID-19 precaution and associated factors. Methods This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study conducted from February 1 st to 15 th , 2021 at Saint Paul’s Hospital Millennium Medical College, a tertiary teaching hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We used a structured questionnaire to conduct a face-to-face exit interview with clients visiting the hospital. Systematic random sampling was employed to recruit study participants. Binary and multivariable logistic regressions were implemented to examine factors associated with precautionary practices. Statistical significance was declared at p-value &lt;0.05. The Crude odds ratio (COR) and Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) were reported with a 95% confidence interval. Results We analyzed data obtained from 262 participants. The mean age of participants was 36 (SD+12) years. The majority (207, 79%) of the study participants had a favorable attitude towards prevention and control measures of COVID-19. A little over half (116, 55.7%) of the respondents had a satisfactory level of practice of COVID-19 precautions. Living in an area with strict enforcement of COVID-19 precautionary measures [AOR: 2.25, 95% CI (1.22–4.15)], and having a favorable attitude of COVID-19 prevention [AOR: 4.88, 95% CI (2.08–11.68)] were significantly associated with satisfactory COVID-19 precautionary practices. Conclusions The level of practice of COVID-19 precaution was unsatisfactory. Favorable attitude and stricter enforcement of COVID-19 preventive measures might have contributed more to adherence to precautionary practices. The findings highlight the need for a public health education strategy targeted at improving attitudes of the community on COVID-19 focusing on the effectiveness of preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W4225554536,"Short segments of RNA displace one strand of a DNA duplex during diverse processes including transcription and CRISPR-mediated immunity and genome editing. These strand exchange events involve the intersection of two geometrically distinct helix types—an RNA:DNA hybrid (A-form) and a DNA:DNA homoduplex (B-form). Although previous evidence suggests that these two helices can stack on each other, it is unknown what local geometric adjustments could enable A-on-B stacking. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of an RNA-5′/DNA-3′ strand exchange junction at an anisotropic resolution of 1.6 to 2.2 Å. The structure reveals that the A-to-B helical transition involves a combination of helical axis misalignment, helical axis tilting and compression of the DNA strand within the RNA:DNA helix, where nucleotides exhibit a mixture of A- and B-form geometry. These structural principles explain previous observations of conformational stability in RNA/DNA exchange junctions, enabling a nucleic acid architecture that is repeatedly populated during biological strand exchange events."
https://openalex.org/W4226195345,"Greater muscle fragility is thought to cause the exhaustion of the muscle stem cells during successive degeneration/repair cycles, leading to muscle wasting and weakness in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Chronic voluntary exercise can partially reduce the susceptibility to contraction induced-muscle damage, i.e., muscle fragility, as shown by a reduced immediate maximal force drop following lengthening contractions, in the dystrophic mdx mice. Here, we studied the effect of Prospero-related homeobox factor 1 gene (Prox1) transfer (overexpression) using an AAV on fragility in chronically exercised mdx mice, because Prox1 promotes slower type fibres in healthy mice and slower fibres are less fragile in mdx muscle.Both tibialis anterior muscles of the same mdx mouse received the transfer of Prox1 and PBS and the mice performed voluntary running into a wheel during 1 month. We also performed Prox1 transfer in sedentary mdx mice. In situ maximal force production of the muscle in response to nerve stimulation was assessed before, during and after 10 lengthening contractions. Molecular muscle parameters were also evaluated.Interestingly, Prox1 transfer reduced the isometric force drop following lengthening contractions in exercised mdx mice (p < 0.05 to 0.01), but not in sedentary mdx mice. It also increased the muscle expression of Myh7 (p < 0.001), MHC-2x (p < 0.01) and Trpc1 (p < 0.01), whereas it reduced that one of Myh4 (p < 0.001) and MHC-2b (p < 0.01) in exercised mdx mice. Moreover, Prox1 transfer decreased the absolute maximal isometric force (p < 0.01), but not the specific maximal isometric force, before lengthening contraction in exercised (p < 0.01) and sedentary mdx mice.Our results indicate that Prox1 transfer increased the beneficial effect of chronic exercise on muscle fragility in mdx mice, but reduced absolute maximal force. Thus, the potential clinical benefit of the transfer of Prox1 into exercised dystrophic muscle can merit further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4223925331,"Microtubule targeting agents (MTAs) are widely used cancer chemotherapeutics which conventionally exert their effects during mitosis, leading to mitotic or postmitotic death. However, accumulating evidence suggests that MTAs can also generate death signals during interphase, which may represent a key mechanism in the clinical setting. We reported previously that vincristine and other microtubule destabilizers induce death not only in M phase but also in G1 phase in primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Here, we sought to investigate and compare the pathways responsible for phase-specific cell death. Primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were subjected to centrifugal elutriation, and cell populations enriched in G1 phase (97%) or G2/M phases (80%) were obtained and treated with vincristine. We found death of M phase cells was associated with established features of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, including Bax activation, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, caspase-3 activation, and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. In contrast, death of G1 phase cells was not associated with pronounced Bax or caspase-3 activation but was associated with loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, parylation, nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G, and supra-nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, which was enhanced by inhibition of autophagy. The results indicate that microtubule depolymerization induces distinct cell death pathways depending on during which phase of the cell cycle microtubule perturbation occurs. The observation that a specific type of drug can enter a single cell type and induce two different modes of death is novel and intriguing. These findings provide a basis for advancing knowledge of clinical mechanisms of MTAs."

However, only one brand of this product has been recommended by the World Health Organisation for IRS. To help increase the diversity of the portfolio of IRS insecticides and offer suitable options to procurers and malaria vector control programmes, additional product brands of this highly effective and long-lasting insecticide formulation for IRS will be needed.We evaluated the efficacy of Pirikool® 300CS, a new capsule suspension formulation of pirimiphos-methyl developed by Tianjin Yorkool, International Trading, Co., Ltd in standard WHO laboratory bioassays and experimental hut studies. The efficacy of the insecticide applied at 1000mg/m2 was assessed in laboratory bioassays for 6 months on cement, plywood and mud block substrates and for 12 months in cement and mud-walled experimental huts against wild free-flying pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae sensu lato in Covè, Benin. Actellic® 300CS, a WHO-recommended capsule suspension formulation of pirimiphos-methyl was also tested. WHO cylinder tests were performed to determine the frequency of insecticide resistance in the wild vector population during the hut trial.The vector population at the hut station was resistant to pyrethroids but susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl. Overall mortality rates of wild free-flying pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae (s.l.) entering Pirikool®300CS treated experimental huts during the 12-month trial were 86.7% in cement-walled huts and 88% in mud-walled huts. Mortality of susceptible An. gambiae (Kisumu) and pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae s.l. (Covè) mosquitoes in monthly wall cone bioassays on Pirikool® 300CS treated hut walls remained over 80% for 10-12 months. The laboratory bioassays corroborated the hut findings with Pirikool® 300CS on mud and wood block substrates but not on cement block substrates.Indoor residual spraying with Pirikool® 300CS induced high and prolonged mortality of wild pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors for 10-12 months. Addition of Pirikool®300CS to the current portfolio of IRS insecticides will provide an extra choice of microencapsulated pirimiphos-methyl for IRS."
https://openalex.org/W4224102590,"Trafficking of M-protein (Mprt) from the cytosol of Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) occurs via Sec translocase membrane channels that associate with Sortase A (SrtA), an enzyme that catalyzes cleavage of Mprt at the proximal C-terminal [-LPST355∗GEAA-] motif and subsequent transpeptidation of the Mprt-containing product to the cell wall (CW). These steps facilitate stable exposure of the N-terminus of Mprt to the extracellular milieu where it interacts with ligands.

Herein, we assessed the effects of mutating the Thr355 residue in the WT SrtA consensus sequence (LPST355∗GEAA-) in a specific Mprt, PAM. In vitro, we found that synthetic peptides with mutations (LPSX355GEAA) in the SrtA cleavage site displayed slower cleavage activities with rSrtA than the WT peptide.

The surface of Gram-positive Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is decorated with a variety of proteins that function in aiding the survival and virulence of these microorganisms.

Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1603-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). All protein epitopes exposed on the cell surfaces of Gram-positive bacteria are stabilized by one or more of these processes. Prokaryotic proteins that are ribosomally generated in the cytoplasm must be secreted or translocated into various cell compartments. This trafficking of different classes of proteins from the cytosol possesses some unique features (6Denks K. Vogt A. Sachelaru I. Petriman N.A. Kudva R. Koch H.G. The Sec translocon mediated protein transport in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2014; 31: 58-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Information contained within the signal peptide and other regions of the protein sequence directs transport of proteins to their cellular compartments through specific CM channels (7von Heijne G. The structure of signal peptides from bacterial lipoproteins.Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 8Carlsson F. Stålhammar-Carlemalm M. Flärdh K. Sandin C. Carlemalm E. Lindahl G. Signal sequence directs localized secretion of bacterial surface proteins.Nature. 2006; 447: 943-946Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cytosolic proteins targeted for extracellular secretion are synthesized with an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide and are transported in their unfolded states through general secretory (Sec) translocon channels, which are assembled in microdomains in the CM from partner proteins. On the other hand, some surface displayed proteins, broadly classified as moonlighting proteins (9Jeffery C.J. Protein moonlighting: What is it, and why is it important?.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2018; 373: 20160523Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), for example, enolase, which functions in the cytoplasm in glycolysis but has other properties on the cell surface, contain neither a signal sequence nor other known trafficking information but nonetheless leave the cytosol and are fully or partly exposed on the cell surface. In Gram-positive GAS, these proteins are likely stabilized by hydrophobic/charge interactions with the CW/outer capsule components or can even extend from the CM to the cell surface. Another group of surface displayed proteins also contains cleavable N-terminal signal sequences which terminate in a lipobox (LAAC), for example, lipoproteins (7von Heijne G. The structure of signal peptides from bacterial lipoproteins.Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These lipoproteins are enzymatically diacylated (with a diacyl glyceryl moiety) at the side-chain SH of the latent Cys1-residue and then are stably inserted into the outer leaflet of the CM in Gram-positive bacteria, where the signal sequence is cleaved, leaving the N-terminal Cys embedded in the CM via its acyl groups. This allows extension of the C-terminal regions of some of these proteins to the cell surface. A final group of proteins, for example, M-proteins (Mprts), contain cleavable N-terminal signal sequences within which is a YSIRK amino acid sequence motif (10Bae T. Schneewind O. The YSIRK-G/S motif of staphylococcal protein A and its role in efficiency of signal peptide processing.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2910-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that directs their trafficking to the multiprotein Sec translocon and also encode a transmembrane region (TMD) near the C-terminus. Using this latter example, Mprts are delayed in the CM at the translocon by their TMDs where they are further processed by CM-embedded Sortase (Srt)-type transpeptidases, enzymes that are also located at the Sec channel (11Hu P. Bian Z. Fan M. Huang M. Zhang P. Sec translocase and sortase A are colocalised in a locus in the cytoplasmic membrane of Streptococcus mutans.Arch. Oral Biol. 2008; 53: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Housekeeping SrtA, universally present in Gram-positive bacteria, recognizes a pentapeptide CW sorting signal, for example, LPXTG, followed by a hydrophobic region of ∼21 residues and a short positively charged cytoplasmic tail (12Schneewind O. Missiakas D.M. Protein secretion and surface display in Gram-positive bacteria.Phil. Trans. R. Soc. 2012; 367: 1123-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). SrtA is a Cys-proteinase that functions by forming an acyl-enzyme complex via nucleophilic attack of the active site Cys at the T↓G of the LPXTG signal motif. This step yields a thioacyl intermediate complex, which then transfers the product to Lipid II. The Lipid II–linked intermediate then becomes a substrate for the growing peptidoglycan CW (13Perry A.M. Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Schneewind O. Anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus. III. Lipid II is an in vivo peptidoglycan substrate for sortase-catalyzed surface protein anchoring.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16241-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which results in the covalent attachment of the processed protein to the CW via the transpeptidase activity of SrtA (14Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Staphylococcus aureus sortase, an enzyme that anchors surface proteins to the cell wall.Science. 1999; 285: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 15Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faul K.F. Schneewind O. Purification and characterization of sortase, the transpeptidase that cleaves surface proteins of Staphylococcus aureus at the LPXTG motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Srts are very important to the composition and consequent properties of the CW and the cell surface and have also been used artificially to engineer the surface of cells (16Kumari P. Bowmik S. Paul S.K. Biswas B. Banerjee S.K. Murty U.S. Ravichandiran V. Mohan U. Sortase A: A chemoenzymatic approach for the labelling of cell surfaces.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2021; 18: 4577-4589Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Thus, a deeper understanding of the properties of these enzymes is of great importance. For ease in reading this article, the domain structures of the Pattern D GAS-AP53 Mprt, PAMAP53, along with important recombinant fragments of PAMAP53, are diagrammed in Figure 1. PAM is the only Mprt present in Pattern D GAS cells and is used for emm serotyping of the GAS (emm53 in this case). From the mining of our annotated genomic sequence of GAS-AP53 (GenBank: CP013672.1) (17Bao Y.J. Liang Z. Mayfield J.A. Donahue D.L. Carothers K.E. Lee S.W. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J. Genomic characterization of a Pattern D Streptococcus pyogenes emm53 isolate reveals a genetic rationale for invasive skin tropicity.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 1712-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we find that the only Srts present in GAS-AP53 cells are SrtA (GenBank: AMY97447.1) and SrtB (GenBank: AMY96673.1). The specificities of these Srts are very different and only SrtA strictly applies to this study. SrtB was used as a negative control for SrtA in some experiments. To purify both Srts, recombinant (His)6-tagged [V82]SrtA and [H37]SrtB were expressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified by affinity chromatography on columns containing immobilized Ni2+, and eluted with imidazole. The final proteins were of high purity and appear at the correct molecular weights (Fig. 2A). These purified enzymes were then employed to examine the cleavage by FRET of the fluorescence-tagged substrates, Dabcyl-LPSXGEAA-Edans, where X = T, A, E, K, W, or Y. The results of the assay are shown in Figure 2B. While all substrates are cleaved at different rates by SrtA, no linear rate of cleavage was faster than that of the native LPSTGEAA and the lowest initial rates of cleavage catalyzed by SrtA were found for the peptides with aromatic residues substituted at sequence position-4, viz., LPSYGEAA and LPSWGEAA. Since WT-PAM (GenBank: AMY98239.1) was selectively retained in the CM in cells in which SrtA was inactivated (18Russo B.T. Ayinuola Y.A. Singh D. Carothers K. Fischetti V.A. Flores-Mireles A.L. Lee S.W. Ploplis V.A. Liang Z. Castellino F.J. The M-protein of Streptococcus pyogenes strain AP53 retains cell surface functional plasminogen binding after inactivation of the sortase A gene.J. Bacteriol. 2020; 202e00096-e00020Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), we designed experiments to determine the cellular distribution of AP53/PAM[T355Y] and AP53/PAM[T355A], compared to WT-PAM, in cell lines with a targeted substitution of these variants in place of WT-PAM. We began by evaluating whether these SrtA-resistant PAMs were processed and secreted in the extracellular medium (EM) at mid-log phase cell growth (Fig. 3A). Western blot assays with polyclonal rabbit-anti-PAM and rabbit-anti PAMshort did not reveal meaningful differences in cell surface expression between the SrtA cleavage product of WT-PAM (lane 3, molecular weight ∼40.6 kDa) and the PAM variants (lanes 4 and 5, molecular weights ∼40.6 kDa) of these different cell lines. Moreover, since the Western blot analyses were performed using anti-PAMshort, the data show that the cell surface PAM variants contain their N-termini, which is primarily the A-domain of PAM. The molecular weights of the PAM variants are the same as that of WT-PAM and all are nearly identical to recombinant PAM (lanes 2 and 7, molecular weight ∼40.9 kDa), which has extra residues for purification purposes, with no band appearing for the AP53/Δpam cells (lane 6), as anticipated. These results demonstrate that PAM[T355Y] and PAM[T355A] have been cleaved by an enzyme(s) that recognizes the SrtA cleavage sequences, LPSAGEAA and LPSYGEAA. We next examined the distribution of PAM in mid-log phase subcellular fractions isolated from WT-AP53, AP53/pam[T355A], and AP53/pam[T355Y] cells. The results of the experiments are shown in Figure 3B. There is very little PAM in the CM fractions obtained from WT-AP53 (lane 1), AP53/pam[T355Y] (lane 2), and AP53/pam[T355A] cells (lane 4) and, as expected, PAM was not present in AP53/Δpam cells (lane 3). However, PAM was observable in the CW fractions of WT-cells (lane 7), as well as in both isogenic mutant strains (lanes 8 and 10), but not in AP53/Δpam cells (lane 9). Thus, the PAM variants were cleaved to a similar extent as WT-PAM, despite the reduced level of activity that the synthetic peptides showed against rSrtA in vitro. Further, these variants were covalently attached to the CW, as indicated by the higher molecular weight PAM-positive bands that contained partially digested CW peptidoglycan, similar to WT cells. This demonstrates that the PAM variants are processed through SrtA. A reasonable explanation of these results is that SrtA, in vitro, has a lower level of activity toward its cleavage site in synthetic peptides than SrtA present in the translocon channel (19Jacobitz A.W. Kattke M.D. Wereszczynski J. Clubb R.T. Sortase transpeptidases: Structural biology and catalytic mechanism.Adv. Protein Chem. Struct. Biol. 2017; 109: 223-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). While the SrtA cleavage site peptide variants exhibit reduced activity toward SrtA in vitro, the activity is sufficient in cells to both cleave and transfer these variants to the CW when these sequences are present in vivo in PAM. To confirm the presence and integrity of the PAM variants on the AP53 cell surface, we performed whole cell immunoassays using anti-PAMshort, as well as flow cytometric analysis of human plasminogen (hPg) binding to the cell lines. The data of Figure 4 show that equivalent amounts of each PAM are present on AP53 cells with their N-termini largely intact, as revealed by their reactivities toward rabbit-anti-PAMshort, when whole cells are analyzed by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 4A) and by ELISA (Fig. 4B). Further, cell surface PAM fully reacts with hPg (Fig. 4C), a property of the N-terminal A-domain. We also show (Fig. 4, D and E) that each of the PAM variants expressed by the isogenic cells stimulates the activation of hPg by SK2b (GenBank: AMY98213.1), an SK subform that is coinherited with PAM-type Mprts (20Zhang Y. Liang Z. Hsieh H.T. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J.

Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 42093-42103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SK2b only enhances hPg activation when hPg is bound to PAM, which requires the N-terminal A-domain of PAM to be exposed to the extracellular solution to interact with hPg (20Zhang Y. Liang Z. Hsieh H.T. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J.

Functional differences between Streptococcus pyogenes cluster 1 and cluster 2b streptokinases are determined by their β-domains.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587: 1304-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that PAM and its variants bind in an equivalent and functional manner with hPg. We expanded this study to further define the enzyme(s) responsible for the cleavage of PAM[T355Y]. Here, we used four isogenic AP53 GAS strains in various experiments: (1) AP53/ΔsrtA; (2) a double mutant deficient in both SrtA and SrtB (AP53/ΔsrtA/ΔsrtB); (3) a mutant deficient in SrtA and carrying the SrtA cleavage site mutation in PAM (AP53/ΔsrtA/pam[T355Y]), and (4), a targeted inactivation of an important membrane protease located at the Sec translocon channel, HtrA (GenBank: AMY98408.1), in a SrtA-deficient background (AP53/ΔsrtA/ΔhtrA). We first determined the subcellular fraction of the WT-AP53 cells that catalyzed cleavage of the WT-sequence, viz., Dabcyl-LPSTGEAA-Edans (T) and its variant, Dabcyl-LPSYGEAA-Edans (Y). From the results of Figure 5A, at dilutions and reaction times wherein the native peptide (LPSTGEAA) is slowly cleaved by all of the cell fractions, the same concentration of the variant peptide, Dabcyl-LPSYGEAA-Edans, is very rapidly cleaved by a component(s) in the CM. This comparative rate effect for Dabcyl-LPSTGEAA-Edans is seen by the dashed box in Figure 5A, where the reaction time of the peptide with the CM for AP53-WT cells was increased to 6 h in the presence of the SrtA-stimulatory nucleophile, hydroxylamine (15Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faul K.F. Schneewind O. Purification and characterization of sortase, the transpeptidase that cleaves surface proteins of Staphylococcus aureus at the LPXTG motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The reaction was greatly stimulated under these conditions, as we expected since the strong nucleophile, hydroxylamine, is known to enhance serine and sulfhydryl proteases in which the mechanism of hydrolysis proceeds through acyl-intermediates (22Lawrence P.J. Strominger J.L. Biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls. XVI. The reversible fixation of radioactive penicillin G to the D-alanine carboxypeptidase of Bacillus subtilis.J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3660-3666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in CMs from cells in which both the genes for both SrtA and SrtB are inactivated (AP53/ΔsrtA/ΔsrtB), as well as in cells in which the genes for srtA and htrA are inactivated (AP53/ΔsrtA/ΔhtrA), the variant (Y) peptide is still rapidly cleaved under conditions in which the peptide with the WT-sequence is cleaved very slowly (Fig. 5B). These cells were also grown with (1S,2S)-2-(((S)-1-((4-guanidinobutyl)amino)-4-methyl-1-oxopentan-2-yl)carbamoyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (E64) in the medium, which is an inhibitor of the maturation of SpeB (23Cole J.N. Aquilina J.A. Hains P.G. Henningham A. Sriprakash K.S. Caparon M.G. Nizet V. Kotb M. Cordwell S.J. Djordjevic S.P. Walker M.J. Role of group A Streptococcus HtrA in the maturation of SpeB protease.Proteomics. 2007; 7: 4488-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This also eliminates SpeB as a candidate protease. Thus, the responsible protease(s) has a much higher specificity for aromatic residues at the fourth position of the SrtA cleavage site than for Thr at this same position in the WT-peptide. Further confirmation that the endopeptidase that catalyzed cleavage of the (Y) variant in the CM of cells with targeted deletions of the srtA and srtB genes is seen by large inhibition of its cleavage by hydroxylamine, an established inhibitor of LPXTGase (24Lee S.G. Fischetti V.A. Purification and characterization of LPXTGase from Staphylococcus aureus: The amino acid composition mirrors that found in the peptidoglycan.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The data presented in Figure 6A demonstrate that AP53/ΔsrtA/pam[T355Y] cells secrete high levels of PAM[T355Y] into the EM (lane 5) that have been cleaved in a manner that yielded very similar molecular weights as rPAM (lane 2) (residues 1–351-His6, molecular weight = 40,941 Da). Additionally, PAM secreted by WT-AP53 cells (lane 3) and by AP53/ΔsrtA cells (lane 4) display molecular weights nearly identical to PAM secreted by WT-AP53 cells. The negative control cells, AP53/Δpam, did not show PAM secretion (lane 6), as anticipated. The data of Figure 6B show that while PAM[T355Y] is cleaved from the CM in AP53/ΔsrtA/pam[T355Y] cells, it is not covalently linked to the CW since partially-digested CW peptidoglycan bands containing PAM[T355Y] are not observed (lane 5). This finding is similar to the CW distribution of PAM from AP53/ΔsrtA cells (lane 4). PAM from WT-AP53 cells, in which PAM is attached to incompletely digested peptidoglycan (lane 3), served as a positive control and the lack of PAM from AP53/Δpam cells (lane 6) provides the negative control. The gels of Figure 6C show that WT-PAM is fully cleaved from the CM (lane 3) in WT-AP53 cells, while both WT-PAM (lane 4) and PAM[T355Y] (lane 5) are retained to a large extent in the CM in the absence of SrtA at molecular weights that suggest that the transmembrane domain is present, as required for embedding in the CM. Overall, the major conclusions of these experiments are that SrtA is not required for cleavage at or near the SrtA consensus site of PAM, but SrtA is necessary for transpeptidation to occur. To discover the exact location of the cleavage site in the peptides that are treated with CM fractions, we employed mass spectrophotometric analysis of the products of the cleaved peptides. Dabcyl-LPSTGEAA-Edans and Dabcyl-LPSYGEAA-Edans were incubated with CM fractions and the products that absorbed at the Dabcyl wavelength were subjected to mass analysis. When incubated with CM from WT-AP53, Dabcyl-LPSTGEAA-Edans showed a peak 668.3 Da (Fig. 7A), consistent with Dabcyl-LPST (calculated, 667.8 Da). This fragment is expected if SrtA catalyzed cleavage of this peptide. Upon incubation of Dabcyl-LPSYGEAA-Edans with WT-AP53 membranes, a peak 916.4 Da was observed (Fig. 7B), uniquely corresponding to Dabcyl-LPSYGE (calculated, 916.0 Da). This is characteristic of cleavage by LPXTGase, a nonribosomal membrane endopeptidase, discovered earlier (24Lee S.G. Fischetti V.A. Purification and characterization of LPXTGase from Staphylococcus aureus: The amino acid composition mirrors that found in the peptidoglycan.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). When Dabcyl-LPSTGEAA-Edans was incubated with CMs from AP53/[ΔsrtA] cells (Fig. 7C), two peaks were found, one at 854.4 Da which is the mass corresponding to Dabcyl-LPSTGE (calculated, 853.9 Da) and which is the main cleavage site for LPXTGase as well as an additional peak 925.4 Da, corresponding to Dabcyl-LPSTGEA (calculated 925.0 Da). Lastly, incubation of Dabcyl-LPSYGEAA-Edans with CMs from AP53/ΔsrtA cells show a primary peak at 916.4 Da (Fig. 7D), corresponding to Dabcyl-LPSYGE (calculated, 916 Da) which was previously determined to be the major cleavage site of LPXTGase (24Lee S.G. Fischetti V.A. Purification and characterization of LPXTGase from Staphylococcus aureus: The amino acid composition mirrors that found in the peptidoglycan.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). While the nature of the products of the cleavage are shown in Figure 7, A–D, the percent yield at the incubation times of 24 h of each product is relevant. Dabcyl-LPSYGEAA-Edans reactions showed >98% cleavage by CMs from either WT (Fig. 7B) or AP53/ΔsrtA (Fig. 7D) cells. However, Dabcyl-LPSTGEAA-Edans had a product yield of 50% with the CM from WT-AP53 cells (Fig. 7A) and only an 11% yield with the CM of AP53/ΔsrtA cells (Fig. 7B) at the times of the experiments, with the remainder being uncleaved peptide. This lower reaction yield of Dabcyl-LPSTGEAA-Edans by CMs from AP53/ΔsrtA cells confirms slower reaction rate of the WT-peptide to the remaining endopeptidase, LPXTGase. In addition to these experiments, we examined the reaction product of Dabcyl-LPSYGEAA-Edans and hexa-alanine (AAAAAA) with CMs from WT-AP53 cells. The product displayed a mass peak at 1158.5 Da (in >60% yield), which corresponds to Dabcyl-LPSYAAAAAA (calculated m/z = 1156.4 Da). The half mass fragment of the parent peak generated in the mass spectrometer at 579.8 Da (in 40% yield) is also present. The mass spectrometry data strongly suggest that the covalent attachment of PAM[T355Y] to the CW is through PAM[Y355] and strongly implicates SrtA as the participating endopeptidase. We further show that PAMs from AP53/ΔsrtA and AP53/ΔsrtA/pam[T355Y] cells are displayed on the cell surface in the absence of SrtA. This was assessed by examining their interaction with anti-PAMshort, indicating that all PAMs tested possessed a relatively intact N-terminus (Fig. 8A) with many, if not all, of the NH2-terminal 51 residues present in the product. The surface-exposed PAMs were also functional in stimulating hPg activation by SK2b (Fig. 8B). Whether extension from the CW, and/or from the CM, is the source of the surface-exposed PAM is not known at this stage, but an SrtA deficiency does not significantly affect the ability of CM-bound PAM to function in binding and stimulating the activation of hPg in whole AP53 cells (18Russo B.T. Ayinuola Y.A. Singh D. Carothers K. Fischetti V.A. Flores-Mireles A.L. Lee S.W. Ploplis V.A. Liang Z. Castellino F.J.

Bacteriol. 2020; 202e00096-e00020Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The SEM results (Fig. 9) confirm all the findings of this article. The micrographs (Fig. 9, A and B) are negative controls showing that PAM is not detected on AP53 cells when anti-PAM is not present (Fig. 9A) or in cells with a targeted deletion of the pam gene (Fig. 9B). However, PAM is clearly visible on WT-AP53 cells (Fig. 9C) and in AP53/pam[T355Y] cells (Fig. 9D) treated with anti-PAMshort. Finally, and importantly, WT-PAM (Fig. 9E) and PAM[T355Y] (Fig. 9F) are abundant on the cell surface when srtA gene is genetically deleted, likely extending from the CM to the surface of the cells. Since Gram-positive bacterial strains do not have an outer membrane to stabilize surface-exposed proteins, specialized mechanisms of protein trafficking exist such that surface proteins are expressed in functional forms on the cell surface. The relatively extensive CW in these bacterial strains is of great utility in this regard. The study of surface proteome of bacterial pathogens is critical to their potential utility as vaccine candidates (25Grandi G. Bacterial surface proteins and vaccines.F1000 Biol. Rep. 2010; 2: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In particular, vaccine candidates toward GAS have largely involved Mprt variants and other surface-exposed proteins as potential antigenic determinants for robust antibody-mediated responses (26Steer A.C.

Storing this sheer amount of genomic data has become a major concern in bioinformatics. General purpose compression techniques (e.g. gzip, bzip2, 7-zip) are being widely used due to their pervasiveness and relatively good speed. However, they are not customized for genomic data and may fail to leverage special characteristics and redundancy of the biomolecular sequences.We present a new lossless compression method CHAPAO (COmpressing Alignments using Hierarchical and Probabilistic Approach), which is especially designed for multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of biomolecular data and offers very good compression gain. We have introduced a novel hierarchical referencing technique to represent biomolecular sequences which combines likelihood based analyses of the sequence similarities and graph theoretic algorithms. We performed an extensive evaluation study using a collection of real biological data from the avian phylogenomics project, 1000 plants project (1KP), and 16S and 23S rRNA datasets. We report the performance of CHAPAO in comparison with general purpose compression techniques as well as with MFCompress and Nucleotide Archival Format (NAF)-two of the best known methods especially designed for FASTA files. Experimental results suggest that CHAPAO offers significant improvements in compression gain over most other alternative methods.

The present study attempts to explain this high vaccination uptake among mothers from Arab society by comparing their risk perceptions regarding seasonal influenza vaccination and disease to those of Jewish mothers. The study further examines the impact of SLIV on parental risk perceptions and influenza vaccination uptake.This cross-sectional study included mothers of children in the second and third grades faced with the decision of whether their children should receive the seasonal influenza vaccination at school. The study population included a stratified sample of Jewish mothers (n = 159) and Arab mothers from all the Arab population sub-groups: Muslim, Christian, Druse and Bedouin (n = 534).A comparison of the Arab and Jewish populations revealed a significant difference in vaccination rates; 61.7% among Arab mothers compared to 33.5% among Jewish mothers (χ2(1) = 39.15, P<0.0001). Moreover, significant differences emerged between the Arab and Jewish populations in health literacy and ability to seek information regarding the seasonal influenza vaccination (t (691) = -5.81, p < 0.0001). While no differences emerged in mothers' perceptions regarding influenza as a disease (t (691) = 1.20, p = 0.2318), Arab mothers perceived the vaccination to be safer than Jewish mothers (t (691) = 2.74, p = 0.0063) and saw its inclusion in the school-located vaccination program as providing more legitimacy (Z = -6.6719, P < .0001).This study showed that the factors influencing vaccination uptake among both the Arab and the Jewish populations include perceived influenza risk, perceived vaccination risk, inclusion in the school-located vaccination program and health literacy. Moreover, influenza vaccination uptake is higher among those who have positive attitudes toward vaccinations, low risk perceptions regarding the vaccine, and low health literacy that impedes their ability to seek information. The research also points to the need for education and tools to boost health literacy among minority groups so that mothers can make independent and informed decisions about whether or not to vaccinate their children."
https://openalex.org/W4224238035,"We previously developed a non-cell-dependent biodegradable scaffold to create in situ tissue-engineered vasculature (iTEV) and tested it in a canine inferior vena cava (IVC) model. As iTEV features change dramatically during tissue generation, practical, simple, and accurate methods to evaluate iTEV are needed. The present study examined the usefulness of a novel method to evaluate iTEV growth and remodeling according to a simple formula using angiography: hepatic vein (HV) index = (IVC–HV junction angle) ÷ (π × [minimal internal iTEV diameter ÷ 2] 2 ). HV index strongly correlated with the pressure gradient across iTEV, which tended to improve during the tissue generation period up to 12 months post-implantation. Time-course changes in HV index reflected iTEV tissue development and in-vivo characteristics, such as hemodynamic congestion. In conclusion, HV index is useful to assess iTEV graft function because it represents both the morphometrics and hemodynamics of iTEV with only diagnostic imaging data."
https://openalex.org/W4224246914,"Background The ability to accurately distinguish bacterial from viral infection would help clinicians better target antimicrobial therapy during suspected lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Although technological developments make it feasible to rapidly generate patient-specific microbiota profiles, evidence is required to show the clinical value of using microbiota data for infection diagnosis. In this study, we investigated whether adding nasal cavity microbiota profiles to readily available clinical information could improve machine learning classifiers to distinguish bacterial from viral infection in patients with LRTI. Results Various multi-parametric Random Forests classifiers were evaluated on the clinical and microbiota data of 293 LRTI patients for their prediction accuracies to differentiate bacterial from viral infection. The most predictive variable was C-reactive protein (CRP). We observed a marginal prediction improvement when 7 most prevalent nasal microbiota genera were added to the CRP model. In contrast, adding three clinical variables, absolute neutrophil count, consolidation on X-ray, and age group to the CRP model significantly improved the prediction. The best model correctly predicted 85% of the ‘bacterial’ patients and 82% of the ‘viral’ patients using 13 clinical and 3 nasal cavity microbiota genera ( Staphylococcus , Moraxella , and Streptococcus ). Conclusions We developed high-accuracy multi-parametric machine learning classifiers to differentiate bacterial from viral infections in LRTI patients of various ages. We demonstrated the predictive value of four easy-to-collect clinical variables which facilitate personalized and accurate clinical decision-making. We observed that nasal cavity microbiota correlate with the clinical variables and thus may not add significant value to diagnostic algorithms that aim to differentiate bacterial from viral infections."

This study investigated CO 2 effects on embryos of the European eel ( Anguilla anguilla ), a catadromous fish that is considered at risk from climate change and that is targeted for hatchery production to sustain aquaculture of the species. Eel embryos were reared in three independent recirculation systems with different pH/CO 2 levels representing “control” (pH 8.1, 300 μatm CO 2 ), end-of-century climate change (“intermediate”, pH 7.6, 900 μatm CO 2 ) and “extreme” aquaculture conditions (pH 7.1, 3000 μatm CO 2 ). Sensitivity analyses were conducted at 4, 24, and 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf) by focusing on development, survival, and expression of genes related to acute stress response ( crhr1 , crfr2 ), stress/repair response ( hsp70 , hsp90 ), water and solute transport ( aqp1 , aqp3 ), acid-base regulation ( nkcc1a , ncc , car15 ), and inhibitory neurotransmission ( GABAAα6b , Gabra1 ). Results revealed that embryos developing at intermediate pH showed similar survival rates to the control, but egg swelling was impaired, resulting in a reduction in egg size with decreasing pH. Embryos exposed to extreme pH had 0.6-fold decrease in survival at 24 hpf and a 0.3-fold change at 48 compared to the control. These observed effects of acidification were not reflected by changes in expression of any of the here studied genes. On the contrary, differential expression was observed along embryonic development independent of treatment, indicating that the underlying regulating systems are under development and that embryos are limited in their ability to regulate molecular responses to acidification. In conclusion, exposure to predicted end-of-century ocean pCO 2 conditions may affect normal development of this species in nature during sensitive early life history stages with limited physiological response capacities, while extreme acidification will negatively influence embryonic survival and development under hatchery conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4225633519,"To grasp the complexity of biological processes, the biological knowledge is often translated into schematic diagrams of, for example, signalling and metabolic pathways. These pathway diagrams describe relevant connections between biological entities and incorporate domain knowledge in a visual format making it easier for humans to interpret. Still, these diagrams can be represented in machine readable formats, as done in the KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways databases. However, while humans are good at interpreting the message of the creators of diagrams, algorithms struggle when the diversity in drawing approaches increases. WikiPathways supports multiple drawing styles which need harmonizing to offer semantically enriched access. Particularly challenging, here, are the interactions between the biological entities that underlie the biological causality. These interactions provide information about the biological process (metabolic conversion, inhibition, etc.), the direction, and the participating entities. Availability of the interactions in a semantic and harmonized format is essential for searching the full network of biological interactions. We here study how the graphically-modelled biological knowledge in diagrams can be semantified and harmonized, and exemplify how the resulting data is used to programmatically answer biological questions. We find that we can translate graphically modelled knowledge to a sufficient degree into a semantic model and discuss some of the current limitations. We then use this to show that reproducible notebooks can be used to explore up- and downstream targets of MECP2 and to analyse the sphingolipid metabolism. Our results demonstrate that most of the graphical biological knowledge from WikiPathways is modelled into the semantic layer with the semantic information intact and connectivity information preserved. Being able to evaluate how biological elements affect each other is useful and allows, for example, the identification of up or downstream targets that will have a similar effect when modified."
https://openalex.org/W4225641688,"Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) is the agonist of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), which participates in innate immune responses under the condition of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI). It has been shown that poly(I:C) exhibited cardioprotective activities through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is the main signal transduction pathway during autophagy. However, the precise mechanism by whether poly(I:C) regulates autophagy remains poorly understood. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the therapeutic effect of poly(I:C) against MIRI and the underlying pathway connection with autophagy. We demonstrated that 1.25 and 5 mg/kg poly(I:C) preconditioning significantly reduced myocardial infarct size and cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, poly(I:C) significantly promoted cell survival by restoring autophagy flux and then regulating it to an adequate level Increased autophagy protein Beclin1 and LC3II together with p62 degradation after additional chloroquine. In addition, mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenoviruses exhibited autophagy activity in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCMs). Mechanistically, poly(I:C) activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to induce autophagy, which was abolished by LY294002 (PI3K antagonist), rapamycin (autophagy activator and mTOR inhibitor), or 3-methyladenine (autophagy inhibitor), suggesting either inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway or autophagy activity interrupt the beneficial effect of poly(I:C) preconditioning. In conclusion, poly(I:C) promotes cardiomyocyte survival from ischemia/reperfusion injury by regulating autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway."
