https://openalex.org/W2106441070,"Endoglin (CD105) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that binds transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and -β3, and coprecipitates with the Ser/Thr kinase signaling receptor complex by affinity labeling of endothelial and leukemic cells. The present study shows that in addition to TGF-β1 and -β3, endoglin interacts with activin-A, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7, and BMP-2 but requires coexpression of the respective ligand binding kinase receptor for this association. Endoglin cannot bind ligands on its own and does not alter binding to the kinase receptors. It binds TGF-β1 and -β3 by associating with the TGF-β type II receptor and interacts with activin-A and BMP-7 via activin type II receptors, ActRII and ActRIIB, regardless of which type I receptor partner is coexpressed. However, endoglin binds BMP-2 by interacting with the ligand binding type I receptors, ALK3 and ALK6. The formation of heteromeric signaling complexes was not altered by the presence of endoglin, although it was coprecipitated with these complexes. Endoglin did not interact with BMP-7 through complexes containing the BMP type II receptor, demonstrating specificity of its action. Our data suggest that endoglin is an accessory protein of multiple kinase receptor complexes of the TGF-β superfamily.

TGF-β-like factors are a multifunctional set of growth and differentiation factors conserved among flies, frogs, and mammals (reviewed in Refs. 1Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

These factors control biological processes such as embryogenesis, organogenesis, morphogenesis of tissues like bone and cartilage, vasculogenesis, wound repair and angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and immune regulation (reviewed in Refs. 2Roberts A.B.

Signaling by ligands of the TGF-β superfamily is mediated by a high affinity, ligand-induced, heteromeric complex consisting of related Ser/Thr kinase receptors divided into two subfamilies, type I and type II (3Massagué J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 172-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Formation of this high affinity complex is essential, as the type II receptor transphosphorylates and activates the type I receptor in a Gly/Ser-rich region (9Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cárcamo J.

Commun. 1995; 207: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The type I receptor in turn phosphorylates and transduces signals to a novel family of recently identified downstream targets, termed Smads (12Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). Although the cooperativity between two kinase receptors is a general signaling mechanism for the TGF-β superfamily, where the type I receptors are considered the signal transducing receptors, ligand binding ability is not restricted to receptor type. For TGF-β and activin, the type II receptors TβRII and ActRII or ActRIIB, respectively, are known to bind ligand independently (14Lin H.Y. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F.

The BMP family differs in this respect as the BMP type I receptors, ALK3 (BMPRI) and ALK6 (BMPRIB), can bind BMP-2 and BMP-4 efficiently in the absence of the type II receptor, yet require a type II receptor for transducing a transcriptional response (22Koenig B.B.

In the case of BMP-7, the type II receptor BMPRII binds ligand weakly, and cooperates with the type I receptors ALK3, ALK6, and ALK2 (ActRI) to generate high affinity receptor complexes (24Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BMP-7 can also bind to the activin type II receptors and form functional complexes with BMP type I receptors (27Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Huylebroeck D. Sampath T.K. Andries M. Smith J.C. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). This cross-talk between the activin receptor system and the BMP receptors suggests BMPs may have a broader function in vivo than first recognized. Endoglin (CD105) is a homodimeric integral membrane glycoprotein composed of disulfide-linked subunits of 90–95 kDa. In human, it is expressed at high levels on vascular endothelial cells and on syncytiotrophoblast of term placenta (28Gougos A. Letarte M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1925-1933PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gougos A. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8361-8364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gougos A. St. Jacques S. Greaves A.

It is transiently expressed on extravillous cytotrophoblasts and induced upon activation of peripheral blood monocytes (31Lastres P. Bellon T. Cabanas C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Acevedo A. Gougos A.

Biol Reprod. 1994; 51: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Transient expression of endoglin is also striking during human heart development, as it is expressed at high levels on endocardial cushion tissue mesenchyme during heart septation and valve formation, and subsequently expression drops as the valves mature (33Qu R. Silver M.M. Letarte M. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Other sites of expression include a population of pre-erythroblasts, leukemic cells of lymphoid and myeloid lineages, and bone marrow stromal fibroblasts (28Gougos A. Letarte M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1925-1933PubMed Google Scholar, 34Buhring H.-J. Muller C.A. Letarte M. Gougos A. Saalmuller A. van Agthoven A.J. Busch F.W.

Haematol. 1996; 93: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Endoglin is the target gene for the dominantly inherited vascular disorder hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1) (36McAllister K.A. Grogg K.M. Johnson D.W. Gallione C.J. Baldwin M.A. Jackson C.E. Helmbold E.A. Markel D.S. McKinnon W.C. Murrell J. McCormick M.K. Pericak-Vance M.A. Heutink P. Oostra B.A. Haitjema T. Westerman C.J.J. Porteus M.E. Guttmacher A.E. Letarte M. Marchuk D.A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). HHT is characterized by frequent nose bleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectases, and the development of arteriovenous malformations predominantly in lung, brain, and the gastrointestinal tract that lead to recurrent hemorrhage and shunting (37Guttmacher A.E. Marchuk D.A. White R.I.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 918-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that mutant forms of endoglin are degraded intracellularly and that HHT1 is associated with reduced levels of surface endoglin on endothelial cells and activated monocytes (38Pece N. Vera S. Cymerman U. White R.J. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Endoglin was shown to bind TGF-β1 and -β3 with high affinity, but not -β2 (39Cheifetz S. Bellón T. Calés C. Vera S. Bernabeu C. Massagué J. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19027-19030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting it mimics the isoform specificity of TβRII. Endoglin was coprecipitated with TβRII and a type I receptor in endothelial and leukemic cells (38Pece N. Vera S. Cymerman U. White R.J. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Clin.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were shown to have a single high affinity binding site representative of TβRII complexes (39Cheifetz S. Bellón T. Calés C. Vera S. Bernabeu C. Massagué J. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19027-19030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, when overexpressed in U937 monocytic cells, endoglin did not alter binding (42Lastres P. Letamendia A. Zhang H. Rius C. Almendro N. Lopez L.A. Langa C. Fabra A. Letarte M. Bernabeu C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These previous studies suggested that endoglin alone may not bind TGF-β. We tested this using a COS1 transfection system and now demonstrate that endoglin requires the coexpression of TβRII to bind TGF-β1 and -β3. In addition, it binds activin-A, BMP-2, and BMP-7 only in the presence of their respective ligand binding receptors. We also demonstrate that endoglin associates with heteromeric signaling receptor complexes of multiple members of the TGF-β superfamily. Endothelial cells were derived from HUVEC of newborns by previously published procedures and maintained as described (28Gougos A. Letarte M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1925-1933PubMed Google Scholar). NCTC2071 fibroblasts were cultured as published (43St-Jacques S. Cymerman U. Pece N. Letarte M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). COS1 cells were maintained and transiently transfected with expression constructs using the DEAE-dextran-chloroquine method as reported (44Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massagué J. Mol. Cell.

The EcoRI fragment of human full-length endoglin in pcEXV-1 (46Bellón T. Corbi A. Lastres P. Calés C. Cebrián M. Vera S. Chefeitz M. Massagué J. Letarte M. Bernabeu C. Eur. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for transient transfection, as all other cDNA used were already subcloned into this mammalian expression vector. The pCMV5 expression constructs containing cDNAs for TβRII, ALK5/HA (tagged at the COOH terminus with the influenza hemagglutinin epitope, HA), ALK1/HA, ActRII/HA, ActRIIB2/HA, ActRIIB2, ActRII/His (tagged at the COOH terminus with six histidine residues), ALK6/HA, ALK2/HA, and ALK3/HA have all been described previously (9Wrana J.L.

Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). P3D1 and P4A4 hybridoma to human endoglin were provided by E. A. Wayner (Seattle, WA) and were described and characterized extensively (50Pichuantes S. Vera S. Bourdeau A. Pece N. Kumar S. Wayner E.A. Letarte M. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Murine IgG1 (Coulter Electronics) was used as an isotype control for these two monoclonal antibodies (mAb). For immunoprecipitation of TβRII, the polyclonal antisera (pAb) C16, which was raised in rabbits by immunization with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 550–565 of the highly conserved carboxyl terminus of human type II TGF-β receptor, was used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). For immunoprecipitation of HA- and FLAG-tagged TGF-β superfamily receptors, monoclonal antibodies 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) and M2 (IBI, Eastman Kodak), respectively, were used. TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 were from R&D Systems. Recombinant human activin-A, BMP-2, and BMP-7 were generous gifts from Y. Eto (Ajinomoto Co. Inc.), V. Rosen (Genentech Institute), and K. Sampath (Creative Biomolecules) respectively. TGF-βs, activin, and BMPs were iodinated with 125I using chloramine-T as described previously (16Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J.

For binding assays with and without affinity labeling, HUVEC or transiently transfected COS1 cell monolayers were incubated with 200 pm125I-TGF-β1 for 4 h, washed, treated with or without disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS; Pierce), and solubilized with lysis solution (0.01 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.128 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) as published previously (54Massagué J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Aliquots (300–500 μl) of total cell lysates containing equivalent protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with control IgG (2 μg), anti-endoglin mAb P3D1 (4 μg), or polyclonal antibody C16 to TβRII (1 μg IgG). Immune complexes were collected with Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed three times with lysis solution containing 1% Triton X-100 (without protease inhibitors), and eluted in 1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate; >95 °C). When different detergents were compared, lysis solution contained 1% digitonin (Wako) or 1% CHAPS (Sigma) instead of Triton X-100; otherwise, the latter was used throughout. Total lysates and eluted immunoprecipitates were counted in a γ counter (Beckman). Cross-linked receptors, bound to radiolabeled ligand, were visualized by separation on SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polacrylamide gel electrophoresis; 4–12% gradient gels; Novex) under reducing (50 mm dithiothreitol) and non-reducing conditions. Gels were subjected to autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat film and DuPont Cronex-II screens or BioMax MS film and the BioMax TranScreen HE intensifying screen system (Kodak). Multiple exposures of each experiment were obtained. For all other ligands tested, HUVEC or transfected COS1 were incubated with 250 pm125I-TGF-β3, 800 pm125I-activin-A, 2 nm125I-BMP-2, or 1–2 nm125I-BMP-7 for 3–4 h, cross-linked with DSS, and analyzed as described above using Triton X-100 in the lysis solution. Conditions for immunoprecipitation and analysis were also the same as above; however, some assays included the mAb P4A4 (1.6 μg) to endoglin, anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (1.5 μg), or anti-FLAG mAb M2 (3 μg) to tagged receptors. Endoglin and TβRII expression in transfected COS1 cells were quantitated by metabolic labeling in Fig. 1. Briefly, transfected COS1 were treated in parallel to affinity labeling by incubation with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Methionine (Met) (Tran35S-label; ICN Pharmaceuticals Canada Ltd.) in Met-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose; Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 h, solubilization in lysis solution containing 1% Triton X-100, and immunoprecipitated with saturating amounts of antibodies, and quantitated using a PhosphorImager and Image Quant Software (Molecular Dynamics) according to published procedures (38Pece N.

In other experiments, endoglin protein levels in transfected COS1 cells were monitored by Western blot analysis. Aliquots of total lysates from affinity-labeled transfected cells were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–12% gradient, non-reducing conditions) and assayed by immunoblotting using mAb P4A4 (1.6 μg/ml) to endoglin as described previously (38Pece N.

Immunoblots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL®; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the protocols provided. Multiple exposures using Hyper-film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were obtained. Equivalent numbers of HUVEC or transiently transfected COS-1 cells at subconfluence (∼90%) were surface-labeled with biotin in the absence of added ligand as reported (38Pece N. Vera S. Cymerman U. White R.J. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated as described under “Binding and Affinity Labeling” except lysates were precleared for at least 1 h with Protein A-Sepharose® CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Eluates were fractionated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride nylon membranes, and blocked as described for Western blots. Membranes were probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (400-fold dilution in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min, and biotinylated proteins were detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); multiple exposures were obtained. Previous studies have shown that endoglin interacts with the TGF-β binding complex. To investigate the nature of this complex, we transiently expressed endoglin in COS1 cells in the presence or absence of TβRII. Cell monolayers were affinity-labeled with125I-TGF-β1, chemically cross-linked using DSS, and cell lysates fractionated by SDS-PAGE either directly or after immunoprecipitation using antibodies to endoglin or TβRII (Fig.1 A). Compared with the vector control, no affinity-labeled proteins were detectable when endoglin was expressed alone (compare lanes 4–6 withlanes 1–3), whereas TβRII expressed alone bound TGF-β1 strongly (lanes 7–9). Control experiments confirmed that endoglin was expressed at levels comparable to that of TβRII (Fig. 1 B). We previously showed that endoglin is processed by COS1 cells and is expressed on the cell surface in the absence of TβRII (38Pece N. Vera S. Cymerman U. White R.J. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, when endoglin was coexpressed with TβRII, affinity-labeled endoglin migrating as a monomer of 105–120 kDa was detected (Fig. 1 A,lane 11). Since endoglin and TβRII migrate close to each other on reducing SDS-PAGE gels, affinity-labeled proteins were also analyzed on non-reducing gels (lanes 14–17). Under these conditions, products characteristic of dimers (180 kDa) and oligomers (>200 kDa) of endoglin were detected (39Cheifetz S. Bellón T. Calés C. Vera S. Bernabeu C. Massagué J. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19027-19030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could be immunoprecipitated using anti-endoglin (Fig.1 A, lane 15). Immunoprecipitation with anti-TβRII revealed that endoglin coprecipitated with TβRII (85–95 kDa) (Fig. 1 A, lane 16). Thus we conclude that endoglin is unable to bind TGF-β1 when expressed alone. We also analyzed the effect of chemical cross-linking on125I-TGF-β1 binding to endoglin (TableI). TGF-β1 binding to endoglin alone was very low in the presence of the cross-linker DSS, and may represent association of endoglin with the low levels of endogenous TGF-β receptors present on COS1 cells (see Fig. 1 A,lanes 1–3). However, in the absence of DSS, no binding of TGF-β1 to endoglin was observed (Table I). When TβRII was coexpressed with endoglin, strong binding of125I-TGF-β1 to endoglin was observed in DSS-treated cells, while binding was significantly less in non-cross-linked samples. In contrast to endoglin, TGF-β1 binding to TβRII showed little dependence on the chemical cross-linker. These data suggest that the binding of TGF-β1 to endoglin is unstable in the absence of a cross-linker.Table IEffect of chemical cross-linking on 125I-TGF-β1 binding to endoglin and TβRII transiently expressed in COS1 cells125I-TGF-β1 boundpCMV5ENDTβRIIEND + TβRII−DSS+DSS−DSS+DSS−DSS+DSS−DSS+DSScpmcpmcpmcpmTotal lysate402,719201,309416,956289,225876,649680,456857,186661,511αTβRII196432741858325867,08461,49947,76153,759αEND046030900298812,297COS1 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated gene constructs endoglin (END) and TβRII in the pCMV5 vector.

Since detergents such as Triton X-100 can disrupt membrane protein complexes, we also solubilized cells with milder detergents like CHAPS and digitonin known to better preserve some protein/protein interactions (55Oettgen H.C.

The chaperone activity of mammalian Hsc70/Hsp70 is regulated by partner proteins that either modulate the peptide binding cycle or that target the actions of these chaperones to specific proteins and subcellular compartments. DnaJ-family proteins (Hdj-1/Hsp40; Hdj-2; Hsj-1) stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70/Hsp70, resulting in the ADP-bound state that binds tightly to peptide substrates (1Ellis R. Curr.

The Hip protein collaborates with Hsc70/Hsp70 and DnaJ homologues in stimulating ATP hydrolysis and, thus, also stabilizes Hsc70/Hsp70 complexes with substrate polypeptides, whereas the Hop protein may provide co-chaperone functions through interactions with the C-terminal peptide binding domain (4Frydman J.

Specialized functions for Hsc70-family chaperones are promoted by their interactions with particular co-chaperones. For instance, the DnaJ-family proteins Ydj1p of yeast and human hdj2 have C-terminal CAAX prenylation motifs that account for their post-translational modification with lipids which anchor them in intracellular membranes, thereby allowing them to recruit Hsp70/Hsc70-family chaperones into protein-folding reactions involved in mitochondrial protein import (7Caplan A.J.

In contrast, hdj-1 and its yeast counterpart Sis1p are uniquely associated with ribosomes among known DnaJ-family members, collaborating with Hsp70/Hsc70-family proteins in folding of nascent polypeptides during translation (11Frydman J.

BAG-1 competes with Hip for binding to the Hsc70/Hsp70 ATPase domain and promotes substrate release (13Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.J. Reed J.C.

Biochemical characterization of two members of this family, BAG-2 and BAG-3, suggests that they interact with and modulate Hsp70/Hsc70 similarly as to BAG-1. The findings reveal unexpected diversity in the protein networks available for targeting Hsp70/Hsc70 functions in cells. Yeast two-hybrid library screening of a human Jurkat cell cDNA library was performed as described previously (13Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.J.

Of the resulting ∼5 × 106 transformants, 112 Leu+ colonies were obtained after 1-week incubation at 30 °C. Assay of β-galactosidase activity of these colonies resulted in 96 clones. Mating tests were then performed using RFY206 yeast strain transformed with pGilda, pGilda mBAG-1-(1–219), or pGilda Hsc70/ATPase. Of these, 66 displayed specific interactions with Hsc70/ATPase. The pJG4–5 cDNAs were recovered using KC8 Escherichia coli strain that is auxotrophic for Trp. DNA sequencing revealed three partially overlapping huBAG-1, four identical and one overlapping cDNAs encoding BAG-2, and two partially overlapping BAG-3 clones. The cDNAs encoding residues 5–211 of huBAG-2 (clone 11) and the C-terminal 135 amino acids of huBAG-3 (clone 28) were subcloned into theEcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These plasmids, as well as pGEX4T-1-BAG-1, pGEX-4T-1-BAG-1(ΔC), and pGEX-4T-1-XL plasmids (13Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.J. Reed J.C.

Cells were then recovered and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and a mixture of other protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim 1697498) at room temperature for 0.5 h, followed by sonication. Cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 27,500 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were incubated with 30 ml of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C overnight. The resin was then washed with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol untilA 280 nm reached <0.01. For removal of GST, the resin with immobilized GST-fusion protein was incubated overnight with 10 units of thrombin (Boehringer, Inc.) at 4 °C in 20 mmTris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. Released proteins were then purified on Mono Q (HR10/10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by fast protein liquid chromatography using a linear gradient of 0.5 m NaCl at pH 8.0 and then dialyzed into chaperone assay buffer. Hip was purified as His6 protein (30Prapapanich V. Chen S. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 944-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation andin vitro GST-protein binding assays were performed as described (13Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.J. Reed J.C.

Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), using recombinant luciferase (Promega, QuantiLumTM) that was heat-denatured at 42 °C for 10 min, 1.8 μm Hsc70 (Sigma; purified from bovine brain), 0.9 μm Hsp40 (kindly provided by O. Minami, Oita Medical College), and various recombinant purified proteins as indicated. Luciferase activity was measured (Promega luciferase assay kit) using a luminometer (EG&G Berthold, MicroLumat luminometer, model LB96 P). All results were normalized relative to non-denatured luciferase subject to the same conditions. Control reactions lacking ATP, Hsc70, or Hsp40 resulted in negligible luciferase refolding. Using the ATPase domain of Hsc70 as a “bait” in yeast two-hybrid screens, several human cDNAs were cloned that encode portions of BAG-1 or two other BAG-1-like proteins, which were arbitrarily named BAG-2 and BAG-3. The longest of the cDNAs for BAG-2 and BAG-3 contained open reading frames (ORFs) of 207 and 162 amino acids, respectively, followed by stop codons. All BAG-1, BAG-2, and BAG-3 cDNAs obtained by two-hybrid library screening with Hsc70/ATPase contained a conserved domain of ∼40–50 amino acids, which we have termed the “BAG” domain (Fig.1). A λ-phage cDNA library was screened using the longest of the BAG-2 and BAG-3 clones derived from two-hybrid screening as hybridization probes. DNA sequencing of huBAG-2 cDNA clones revealed an ORF encoding a predicted 211-amino acid protein, preceded by an in-frame stop codon (Fig. 1 A). The predicted ATG initiation codon resides in a favorable context for translation. The longest of the 23 obtained huBAG-3 λ-phage cDNA clones contained a continuous ORF of 682 amino acids followed by a stop codon, but without an identifiable start codon. Thus, the 5′ end of this ORF remains to be defined. Though BAG-1, BAG-2, and BAG-3 all contain a homologous BAG domain near their C termini, the N-terminal regions of these proteins are dissimilar. The BAG-2 N-terminal region contains potential kinase phosphorylation sites but otherwise shares no apparent similarity with other proteins or functional domains. In contrast, the predicted N-terminal region BAG-3 contains a WW domain (Fig.1 A). bBLAST and FASTA searches of the translated GenBankTM data base also identified human expressed sequence tags that appear to represent additional BAG-family proteins, which we have tentatively termed BAG-4 (accession numbers AA693697 and N74588) and BAG-5 (accession numbers AA456862 and N34101). The putative BAG-4 and BAG-5 proteins contain BAG domains that share the greatest sequence similarity with the BAG domain of BAG-3, having 62% identity (∼81% similarity) to BAG-4 and 51% identity (∼75% similarity) to BAG-5 (Fig. 1 B). Probable BAG-family orthologues or homologues were also identified by computer-based searches in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The C. elegans genome encodes two apparent BAG-family proteins, which are most similar in their overall sequences to the human BAG-1 (Afo39713, gi:2773211) and BAG-2 (Afo68719, gi:3168927), whereas S. pombe contains two BAG-family proteins that share the greatest overall sequence similarity with human BAG-1 (ALo23S54, gi/3133105 and Alo23634, gi/3150250). The human andC. elegans BAG-1 proteins as well as S. pombeBAG-1A all have ubiquitin-like domains of unknown function near their N termini (Fig. 1 A). Evolutionary tree prediction algorithms suggest that human and C. elegans BAG-2 represent a distinct branch of the BAG-family that is more evolutionarily distant from the other BAG-family proteins. None of the predicted BAG-family proteins contain recognizable regions analogous to those found in other Hsc70 regulatory proteins, such as the J-domains and G/F-domains of DnaJ-family proteins and the TetratricopeptideRepeat (TR) domains of Hip/Hop family proteins. To confirm that the BAG-2 and BAG-3 proteins interact specifically with Hsc70/ATPase, the longest of the cDNAs obtained for each of these proteins were expressed with N-terminal transactivation (TA) domains in yeast and tested by two-hybrid assay for interactions with fusion proteins consisting of Hsp70/ATPase or a variety of unrelated proteins (Fas, Siah, Fadd) containing N-terminal LexA DNA-bindings domains. TA-BAG-2 and TA-BAG-3 displayed positive interactions with LexA-Hsc70/ATPase, resulting in transactivation of a lacZ reporter gene under the control of LexA operators, whereas no interactions with LexA-Fas (cytosolic domain), LexA-Siah, LexA-Fadd, or LexA were detected by this method (Fig. 2 A). BAG-2 and BAG-3 also failed to interact with BAG-1 or a deletion mutant of BAG-1(ΔC), which is missing part of its C-terminal domain required for Hsp70/Hsc70 binding (13Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.J. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins do not form heterodimers. Specific two-hybrid interactions between Hsc70/ATPase and either BAG-2 or BAG-3 were also observed when BAG-2 and BAG-3 were expressed as LexA DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, and Hsc70/ATPase was fused with a TA domain (Fig. 2 A, right panel), further confirming the validity of the measured interactions. Association of BAG-2 and BAG-3 with Hsc70/ATPase was also tested by anin vitro protein binding assay wherein Hsc70/ATPase or BAG-family proteins were expressed in bacteria as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, and tested for binding to35S-labeled in vitro translated (IVT) proteins.35S-Hsc70/ATPase bound in vitro to GST-BAG-1, GST-BAG-2, and GST-BAG-3 but not to GST-BAG-1(ΔC) or a variety of negative control proteins such as GST-CD40 cytosolic domain (Fig.2 B). Similarly, GST-Hsc70/ATPase bound to35S-BAG-1, BAG-2, and BAG-3 but not to BAG-1(ΔC) or several other control proteins (Fig. 2 B; and not shown). BAG-1, BAG-2, and BAG-3 also exhibited little or no binding to themselves or each other, suggesting that these proteins do not strongly homo- or hetero-dimerize or oligomerize. Next, the ability of the BAG-2 and BAG-3 proteins to interact in cells with Hsc70 was explored by co-immunoprecipitation assays, expressing these proteins with N-terminal Flag epitope tags in 293T human epithelial cells. For these experiments, cDNAs encoding the λ-phage cloned regions of BAG-2 and BAG-3 were subcloned in-frame into pcDNA3-Flag. Anti-Flag immune complexes prepared from 293T cells after transfection with plasmids encoding Flag-BAG-1, Flag-BAG-2, or Flag-BAG-3 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot assay, revealing the presence of associated Hsc70, as detected with an anti-Hsc70-specific antiserum. In contrast, control immune complexes prepared with IgG1 as well as anti-Flag immune complexes prepared from cells transfected with Flag-tagged control proteins such as Daxx and Apaf-1 did not contain associated Hsc70 protein (Fig.1 C). BAG-1 binds tightly to the ATPase domain of Hsc70 (31Stuart J.K. Myszka D.G. Joss L. Mitchell R.S. McDonald S.M. Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22506-22514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To contrast the affinity and kinetics of binding of Hsc70/ATPase to BAG-1 with that of BAG-1, BAG-2, and BAG-3 proteins, we used a surface plasmon resonance technique (BIAcore) (29Xie Z. Schendel S. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6410-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Stuart J.K. Myszka D.G. Joss L. Mitchell R.S. McDonald S.M. Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22506-22514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For these experiments, BAG-1, BAG-2, and BAG-3 proteins were produced in bacteria and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 3 A) and then immobilized on biosensor chips and tested for interactions with Hsc70 in the soluble phase. Addition of Hsc70 to chips containing BAG-1, BAG-2, or BAG-3 resulted in concentration-dependent binding, as reflected by an increase in the response units (Fig.3 B, RU; and data not shown) measured at the chip surface. In contrast, Hsc70 failed to display interactions in BIAcore assays with a variety of control proteins (not shown) as well as a mutant of BAG-1 lacking a C-terminal portion of the BAG domain that is required for Hsc70-binding (Fig. 3 B) (13Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.J. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Moreover, flowing various control proteins such as GST, BSA, and Bcl-XL over the BAG-1, BAG-2, or BAG-3 chips resulted in negligible interaction (not shown), further confirming the specificity of these results. The rates of Hsc70 binding to BAG-1, BAG-2, and BAG-3 were similar, following pseudo first-order kinetics with estimated association rate constants (ka) of 2.1, 2.1, and 2.4 × 105m−1 sec−1, respectively. After allowing binding of Hsc70 to immobilized BAG-1, BAG-2, or BAG-3 to reach plateau levels, the chaperone was removed from the flow solution, and the dissociation rate was monitored. BAG-1 and BAG-2 exhibited similar dissociation rates, with relatively slow loss of Hsc70 from the chip surface, resulting in estimated dissociation rate constants (kd) of 3.0 and 5.0 × 10−4 sec−1, respectively (Fig.3 B). In contrast, Hsc70 dissociated more rapidly from biosensor chips containing BAG-3 (Fig. 3 B), yielding an estimated kd of 1.7 × 10−3sec−1. From the kinetic data, the apparent affinities (K D =kd/ka) were calculated for binding of Hsc70 to BAG-1 (K D ≅ 1.4 nm), BAG-2 (K D ≅ 2.4 nm), and BAG-3 (K D ≅ 7.4 nm). We conclude, therefore, that interactions of Hsc70 with these BAG-family proteins occur with apparent affinities sufficient for physiological relevance. BAG-1 has been shown to inhibit Hsp70/Hsc70-dependent refolding of denatured protein substrates in vitro (13Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.J. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 14Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 15Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). We, therefore, contrasted the effects of BAG-1 with BAG-2 and BAG-3 using in vitro protein refolding assays similar to those employed previously for assessing BAG-1 function. In one assay (10Terada K. Kanazawa M. Bukau B. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), purified components were employed consisting of human Hsc70 and bacterial DnaJ. The combination of Hsc70 (1.8 μm) and DnaJ (0.9 μm) resulted in ATP-dependent refolding of chemically denatured firefly luciferase, with function of over half the denatured enzyme restored in a 90-min reaction, as monitored by a chemiluminescence assay. In contrast, neither Hsc70 nor DnaJ alone was competent to induce substantial refolding of denatured luciferase (not shown), and very little spontaneous restoration of luciferase activity was seen with control proteins such as BSA, GST, or Bcl-XL (Fig.4 A, and not shown). Addition of recombinant purified BAG-1, BAG-2, or BAG-3 to these assays in amounts equimolar to Hsc70 (1.8 μm) resulted in striking inhibition of luciferase refolding, with BAG-2 and BAG-3 displaying somewhat greater inhibitor activity than BAG-1 (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the BAG-1(ΔC) protein that fails to bind Hsc70 (Fig.4 A), as well as several other control proteins (not shown), had no effect in this refolding assay. In another refolding assay (32Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), purified Hsc70 and the human DnaJ homolog Hdj-1 (Hsp40) were employed with additional cofactors provided in reticulocyte lysates (5% v/v) to produce a system competent to refold denatured luciferase. Various amounts of purified BAG-1, BAG-2, or BAG-3 were added relative to Hsc70, resulting in concentration-dependent inhibition of Hsc70 chaperone activity. As in the other assay, BAG-2 and BAG-3 inhibited Hsc70 chaperone activity at least as potently as BAG-1. In contrast, the BAG-1(ΔC) mutant (Fig. 4 B) as well as a variety of control proteins (not shown) did not suppress Hsc70-mediated refolding of denatured luciferase. Previously, it has been shown that BAG-1 competes with Hip for binding to Hsc70, with these proteins having opposing effects on Hsc70-mediated protein refolding (15Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Addition to refolding assay reactions of purified Hip protein (Fig. 3 A) at equimolar concentrations relative to BAG-1, BAG-2, or BAG-3 (1.8 μm) completely negated the inhibitory effects of these BAG-family proteins on refolding of denatured luciferase (Fig. 4 C). This observation demonstrates that the suppression of Hsc70 chaperone activity by BAG-1, BAG-2, and BAG-3 is reversible, and suggests that Hip antagonizes the effects not only of BAG-1, as previously reported (15Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), but also BAG-2 and BAG-3. Though BAG-1 reportedly stimulates ADP/ATP exchange (15Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and shares some limited sequence similarity with the prokaryotic nucleotide exchange factor GrpE (31Stuart J.K. Myszka D.G. Joss L. Mitchell R.S. McDonald S.M. Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22506-22514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we observed only an ∼2-fold increase in nucleotide exchange induced by BAG-1 (not shown), suggesting that its mechanism is not analogous to GrpE. Hsc70/Hsp70 family molecular chaperones require partner proteins for dictating their functions in specific cellular compartments and cellular processes (1Ellis R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R531-R533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar, 3Bukau B. Horwich A. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). The discovery of a family of BAG-1-like proteins thus reveals additional potential diversity in the regulation of Hsc70/Hsp70 chaperones. BAG-family proteins all contain an ∼45-amino acid conserved region that mediates binding to the ATPase domain of Hsc70/Hsp70 but differ markedly in their N-terminal unique regions. These non-conserved regions of BAG-family proteins may participate in targeting of Hsc70/Hsp70 to other proteins or protein complexes or may control their subcellular distribution. For instance, isoforms of the human BAG-1 protein have been identified that differ in their N-terminal regions, with the BAG-1L protein containing a nuclear localization sequence that preferentially targets it to the nucleus (16Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 17Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar). BAG-1L has been shown to collaborate with androgen receptors, enhancing their transactivation function, whereas BAG-1 does not (28Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11660-11666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), demonstrating an important functional difference between these proteins. It seems likely, therefore, that the unique regions of other BAG-family proteins, such as the WW domain (33Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 161-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) found in BAG-3, will be responsible for mediating interactions with specific proteins in various subcellular compartments. It is also likely that additional diversity can be generated through tissue-specific control of BAG-family gene expression (17Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar), analogous to the DnaJ-family protein wherein at least one member, Hsj-1, is expressed primarily in neurons (34Cheetham M. Brion J. Anderton B. Biochemistry J. 1998; 284: 469-476Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The ability of BAG-family proteins to modulate the chaperone activity of Hsc70/Hsp70 can have different consequences for the various proteins whose functions are controlled by conformational changes induced by Hsc70/BAG-complexes. For instance, BAG-1 or its longer isoforms BAG-1M and BAG-1L have been reported to form complexes with and enhance the functions of Bcl-2, the kinase Raf, androgen receptors, human growth factor (HGF) receptors, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, while inhibiting retinoic acid receptors (RAR), glucocorticoid receptors, and Siah-1 (18Takayama S.

The mechanisms responsible for either a net enhancement or inhibition of protein function in vivo may not be predictable. The functional antagonisms displayed between BAG-family proteins and Hip suggests that a proper balance of these two types of protein is required for achieving optimal cycles of substrate binding and release required for inducing conformational changes in proteins, with Hip promoting peptide substrate binding by Hsc70/Hsp70 and BAG-family protein promoting dissociation. Thus, while BAG-family proteins exert a measurable inhibitory effect on Hsc70-assisted refolding of denatured luciferase in vitro, this may not be reflective of all protein folding reactions in which BAG-family proteins participate in cells. Future studies of the biological roles played by individual members of the BAG-family, as well as biochemical and structural analysis of their mechanisms, are likely to provide new insights into the repertoire of means used to customize Hsc70/Hsp70 chaperone functions in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2083359402,"P84 (also known as SHPS-1, BIT, and SIRP) is a heterophilic adhesive membrane protein involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling that is found at synapses in the mammalian central nervous system and in non-neural tissues. We have identified a binding partner for P84 using an expression cloning strategy. Here we report that integrin-associated protein (IAP/CD47) is a predominant binding partner of P84. Immunohistochemistry reveals a virtually identical distribution of P84 and IAP in a variety of adult brain regions. Because IAP has been implicated in cell signaling in cells of the immune system, P84 and IAP represent a heterophilic binding pair that is likely to be involved in bi-directional signaling at the synapse and in other tissues.

We originally identified the immunoglobulin family member P84 by virtue of its adhesive properties when tested with cerebellar and neocortical neurons (5Chuang W. Lagenaur C.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The ability of P84 to promote neurite outgrowth and stimulate robust filopodial extension in growth cones suggested that its ligand was also capable of signal transduction (5Chuang W. Lagenaur C.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Abosch A. Lagenaur C. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The association of P84 with synaptic regions in the CNS suggested that it might be another candidate molecule for mediation of synaptic adhesion. We recently cloned the P84 gene and discovered that it was identical to SHPS-1, BIT, and SIRP-α molecules that had been identified by their binding to the cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2 (7Comu S.

P84 contains a single transmembrane domain, three extracellular Ig-like domains, and a cytoplasmic segment that includes tyrosine phosphorylation sites. These phosphotyrosines correspond to sites recognized by SH2-containing segments of the SHP-2 phosphatase. There remain many intriguing questions regarding P84 that are to be answered, including how and why this molecule is localized at the synapse, what the downstream effects of P84 activation are, and what extracellular molecules are involved in initiating signaling via P84. To address this last question, we undertook an expression-cloning approach to identify ligands that bound to the extracellular segment of P84. We have discovered that a predominant ligand for P84 is the integrin-associated protein (IAP/CD47). In addition to its expression in lymphocytes and other extraneural tissues, IAP was known to be expressed in the brain, and its expression has recently been associated with memory formation (11Huang A-M. Wang H.L. Tang Y.P. Lee E.H.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4305-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against IAP blocked the adhesion of cerebellar neurons, erythrocytes, and thymocytes to P84-coated substrates. We also showed that the distribution of P84 and IAP in the cerebellum and retina were very similar and consistent with their participation in a heterophilic synaptic adhesion complex. Alkaline phosphatase (AP)-tag2 and AP-tag4 plasmids were a generous gift of J. Flanagan (Harvard University, School of Medicine). The sequences corresponding to the signal peptide and extracellular segment of murine P84 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and cloned into theBglII site of the AP-tag 2 vector. This plasmid was transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) into 293TWT cells (Edge Biosystems), and the supernatant was collected between days 4 and 8. The supernatant was monitored for phosphatase activity using a synthetic substrate,p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma 104 phosphatase substrate) (12Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was affinity purified and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As a control, 293T cells were transfected with the AP-tag4 plasmid, which directed the secretion of AP alone. For P84 ligand staining in situ, the P84-AP fusion protein (culture supernatant) was incubated with tissue sections or cells (receptor alkaline phosphatase (RAP) in situ) following the method of Cheng and Flanagan (13Cheng H-J. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of IAP was cloned into the AP-tag2 vector, and an IAP-AP fusion protein was produced as described above for P84-AP. Immunopurified P84, L1, and neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) were spotted on nitrocellulose, blocked, and incubated with IAP-AP for 30 min. After washing, AP activity was detected with NBT/BCIP. An adult mouse brain cDNA library was obtained from Edge Biosystems Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). This library was constructed in the pEAK8 plasmid vector. Forty pools of about 2500 colonies each were plated. These were harvested into liquid medium, and an aliquot of each was saved. DNA was extracted from the remainder of each sample (Perfect Prep Kit, 5 Prime–3 Prime, Inc.). DNA from each pool (0.3–0.5 μg) was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells in 6-well plates using LipofectAMINE. After 48 h, cells were incubated with P84-AP fusion protein and stained. From a single positive pool, a single cDNA clone was purified by sib selection. Briefly, the culture corresponding to the positive pool was replica plated onto nylon membranes, and one of these membranes divided into ten segments. DNA was extracted from each of the subpools and tested for staining with the P84-AP fusion protein. This process was iterated until a single positive cDNA clone was obtained. As a control, transfected and untransfected cells were stained with P84-AP and AP alone. The positive clones were sequenced using vector-specific primers (pEAK8.for -ggatcttggttcattctcaa; and pEAK8.rev -ctggatgcaggctactctag) and with gene-specific primers. Animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and dissected tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Cryostat sections were collected on pretreated slides. The monoclonal P84 and IAP (miap301, PharMingen) antibodies were previously described (5Chuang W. Lagenaur C.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Lindberg F.P. Bullard D.C. Caver T.E. Gresham H.D. Beaudet A.L. Brown E.J. Science. 1996; 274: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Sections were stained with primary antibodies for 1 h and incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Cappel) for 30 min. The staining was examined with fluorescence microscopy. Coverslips were first coated with nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell, Inc.) as described previously (6Abosch A. Lagenaur C. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Purified proteins (P84, P84-AP, laminin, or miap301 antibody) were spotted at the center of the coated coverslips in 5-mm spots. The substrate solution was aspirated after 5 min. Coverslips were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS followed by medium containing 10% horse serum. Laminin was a generous gift of Dr. J. Hassel (University of Pittsburgh). Cerebellar cells were prepared as described previously (15Schnitzer J. Schachner M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1981; 1: 429-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Blood was collected from adult mice in heparinized tubes, washed twice, and suspended in 1% BSA containing PBS at a titer of 5 × 106 cell/ml. Thymus was removed from young mice, washed several times with PBS, and cut into several small pieces to release free thymocytes. After several washes, thymocytes were resuspended in PBS containing 1% BSA at a titer of 5 × 106 cell/ml. Purified miap301 (0.5 mg/ml) was added to suspended cells at 1:100 ratio and then allowed to bind for 20 min at 0 °C. After plating on P84-coated coverslips and incubation for 2 h, cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and counted. To facilitate the cloning of P84-binding proteins, a cDNA encoding the P84 ectodomain was inserted into the AP-tag2 vector (13Cheng H-J. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This plasmid directs expression of a soluble fusion protein with human alkaline phosphatase at the carboxyl-terminal end (Fig.1 A). 293T cells transiently transfected with this construct secreted the recombinant P84-AP, and this fusion protein was purified with an anti-P84 affinity column (Fig.1 B). Because native P84 was known to be a good substrate for cerebellar cell attachment and neurite outgrowth, we tested the purified P84-AP fusion protein in a cell adhesion assay. The purified P84-AP was immobilized on Petri dishes, and mouse cerebellar cells were allowed to attach and grow for 24 h. There was no obvious difference in the attachment of neurons or pattern of neurite growth on native P84 or P84-AP (Fig. 1 C, and see Ref. 5Chuang W. Lagenaur C.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). RAP in situ staining (13Cheng H-J. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) was done to examine P84 binding activity in the brain regions which were known to contain P84. In the cerebellum, the molecular layer was heavily stained, and a pattern consistent with synaptic glomeruli in the granule cell layer was observed (Fig.1 D). This P84-AP cerebellar staining was very similar to that seen with P84 antibody staining (7Comu S. Weng W. Olinsky S. Ishwad P. Mi Z. Hempel J. Watkins S. Lagenaur C.F. Narayanan V. J. Neuroscience. 1997; 17: 8702-8710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested that the P84-AP probe detected an endogenous extracellular binding partner for P84. No staining was observed with AP alone (Fig. 1 E). To search for P84-binding proteins, we screened a mouse brain cDNA library with the P84-AP fusion protein. Transfected cells were screened for P84-AP binding using the procedure described by Cheng and Flanagan (13Cheng H-J. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). AP without the P84 ectodomain was included as a negative control. From the 40 pools screened (about 2,500 colonies in each pool), two positive pools were identified. From one of these, a single positive cDNA clone was purified (Fig. 2). Sequencing of the cDNA derived from this clone revealed that it was the brain-specific form of mouse IAP (form 4) (16Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Plas D. Reynolds S. Peters M.G. Brown E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3419-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This form of IAP has the longest cytoplasmic domain of all the forms of IAP. We also noticed that a region of 63 nucleotides that encode 21 amino acids in the extracellular domain near the first transmembrane region (but not in IgV-like domain) is lacking in this particular clone. This 21 amino acid region is also lacking in some mouse, rat, and human IAP forms (Fig. 3 A) (17Furusawa T. Yanai N. Hara T. Miyajima A. Obinata M. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An IAP-AP fusion protein was tested for binding on purified P84, L1, and N-CAM. Binding was observed on P84 but not on the other molecules (Fig.3 B).Figure 3Comparison of P84 ligand to IAP. A, diagram showing the structure of mouse IAP and the P84 ligand. B, IAP-AP fusion protein binds directly to purified brain P84 but not L1 or N-CAM. No binding is seen with AP alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Freshly dissociated cerebellar cells can bind to native P84 within 10 min. We tested whether IAP was present on trypsin-dissociated cerebellar cells. Anti-IAP (miap301) was bound to nitrocellulose-coated coverslips, and cerebellar cells were tested for their ability to bind to these coverslips. Cell binding to this antibody occurred within 10 min; with overnight incubation, the cells remained attached to the antibody substrate and extended neurites (data not shown). To determine whether IAP represented a major binding partner for P84, we attempted to block neuronal IAP with the miap301 antibody which is directed against the IgV domain of IAP. We then tested antibody-treated neurons for their ability to bind to purified brain P84. Freshly dissociated cerebellar cells were incubated with anti-IAP antibody or in antibody-free media for 30 min at 0 °C and then plated on P84-coated coverslips. Cells were allowed to attach for 2 h at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and photographed. The antibody-blocking effect was dramatic; virtually no antibody-treated neurons attached, in contrast to the large number of cells that attached in untreated controls (Fig.4, A and B). To be sure that the blocking effect was specific, we tested the ability of anti-IAP to interfere with neuronal binding to laminin. As shown in Fig. 4, D and E, anti-IAP had no effect on neuronal binding to laminin. Both P84 and IAP are found on a number of non-neuronal tissues, with IAP found on lymphocytes and erythrocytes (as well other tissues) and P84 found on dendritic cells and macrophages (18Adams S. van der Laan L.J.W. Vernon-Wilson E. de Lavalette C.R. Döpp E.A. Dijkstra C.D. Simmons D.L. van den Berg T.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1853-1859PubMed Google Scholar, 19Timms J.F. Carlberg K. Gu H. Chen H. Kamatkar S. Nadler M.J.S. Rohrshneider L.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3838-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To determine whether some of the other IAP expressing cells could bind to P84, we tested thymocytes and erythrocytes for their ability to bind to brain P84. Both erythrocytes and thymocytes attached rapidly to P84-coated coverslips, and this binding could be completely blocked by anti-IAP antibody (Fig. 4,G–L). These experiments support the idea that IAP might be a ubiquitous receptor for P84. To be a functional ligand-receptor binding pair in the brain, P84 and IAP must be expressed on adjacent membranes of interacting cells. Previous studies with a P84 antibody demonstrated an apparent synapse-associated distribution of P84 in cerebellum and retina. We stained adjacent sections from these two structures with anti-IAP and anti-P84 antibodies for comparison. The overall distribution of P84 and IAP was strikingly similar. In the cerebellum, the molecular layer exhibited the most intense P84 and IAP staining, and in the granule cell layer, staining was observed that appeared to be associated with synaptic glomeruli (Fig.5, A and B; see also Ref. 6Abosch A. Lagenaur C. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the retina, both P84 and IAP were found in the synapse-rich inner plexiform and outer plexiform layers, with little or no staining outside of these synaptic layers (Fig. 5, C andD). This co-localization of P84 and IAP is consistent with an adhesive association between these two molecules in vivo. P84 is a synapse-associated cell adhesion molecule that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (5Chuang W. Lagenaur C.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Comu S. Weng W. Olinsky S. Ishwad P. Mi Z. Hempel J. Watkins S. Lagenaur C.F. Narayanan V. J. Neuroscience. 1997; 17: 8702-8710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P84 is identical to SHPS-1, BIT, and SIRP-α, molecules that are known to bind the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and modulate cell signaling (8Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The human SIRPs comprise a large family of signaling molecules, encoded by different genes, with multiple isoforms generated from these genes by alternative splicing (10Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Because P84 has been associated with synapse-rich regions in the CNS, and because P84 was known to bind to a heterophilic receptor, the intriguing possibility existed that P84 and its receptor were involved in establishment or regulation of synaptic function. Isolation of a membrane ligand that bound to the extracellular domain of P84 was critical for the analysis of mechanisms by which P84 and this ligand contributed to the formation of synapses. We have cloned a ligand for the P84 molecule and identified it as IAP (CD 47). This identification is supported by the following observations. 1) The distribution of P84 binding activity (by RAP-in situ staining with P84-AP fusion protein) and IAP by immunohistochemistry are identical. 2) The distribution of P84 and its ligand, IAP, within the brain and retina are also identical, with both being strongly expressed in various synaptic regions. 3) A monoclonal antibody against IAP completely blocked the attachment of cerebellar neurons, erythrocytes, and thymocytes to P84-coated substrates. These findings support our conclusion that IAP was indeed a ligand for the P84 adhesion molecule. IAP was initially described as a 50-kDa cell surface protein that was involved in the enhancement of neutrophil adhesion, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis triggered by extracellular matrix molecules (20Senior R.M. Gresham H.D. Griffin G.L. Brown E.J. Chung A.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2251-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Brown E. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). IAP did not directly interact with integrin ligands (RGD-containing peptides) but could physically associate with certain integrins and could regulate integrin function (21Brown E. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). IAP appears to be a functional component of several processes including (a) transendothelial and transepithelial migration of neutrophils (23Cooper D. Lindberg F.P. Gamble J.R. Brown E.J.

Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar); and (f) stroma-supported erythropoiesis in spleen and other tissues (17Furusawa T. Yanai N. Hara T. Miyajima A. Obinata M. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). IAP was widely expressed in hematopoietic cells (erythrocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, monocytes, and neutrophils) and other tissues (placenta, surface epithelia, liver, and brain), including cells that did not express integrins (29Rosales C. Gresham H.D. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2759-2764PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mawby W.J. Holmes C.H. Anstee D.J. Spring F.A. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This suggested that there were integrin-independent functions of IAP. The structure of human and murine IAP was inferred from primary sequence of cloned cDNAs (30Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The N terminus of IAP (extracellular) contains an immunoglobulin-like domain, most similar to members of the IgV family. Several alternatively spliced isoforms of IAP mRNA are known to exist, one of these (form 4) being most abundant in the brain and peripheral nervous system (16Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Plas D. Reynolds S. Peters M.G. Brown E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3419-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human SIRP gene family contains at least 14 members that differ in the amino acid sequence of the extracellular domains (10Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Whether these different forms of P84/SIRP all bind to IAP isoforms or to other ligands, remains to be determined. Recently, an interesting correlation has been noted between levels of IAP mRNA in the hippocampus and memory retention in rats (11Huang A-M. Wang H.L. Tang Y.P. Lee E.H.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4305-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These authors suggest that IAP may have a role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory formation, an idea consistent with our finding that IAP is a ligand for the synaptic neural adhesion molecule, P84. P84 homologues SHPS-1 and SIRP are known to be involved in cell signaling via tyrosine phosphorylation in a variety of cell types. As noted above, IAP is also known to play critical roles in cell signaling in cells of the immune system. Our findings identify P84 and IAP as a bi-directional signaling pair that may be preserved across a variety of tissues, including both the nervous system and immune system. Although the details of the mechanisms of signaling of each of these molecules remains unclear, their distinct structures suggest that the signals are likely to be different in the cells that express P84 and those that express IAP. Based on their synaptic localization and apparent signaling capacities, we propose that P84 and IAP may also be involved in regulation of synaptic function and remodeling. We thank Dr. J. Flanagan for providing the Ap-tag plasmids and for sharing a manuscript describing AP-staining methods.

https://openalex.org/W1947863214,"When cultured hepatocytes were incubated in cell culture medium at 4°C for up to 30 h and then returned to 37°C, blebbing of the plasma membrane, cell detachment, chromatin condensation and margination, enhanced nuclear stainability with Hoechst 33342, ruffling of the nuclear membrane, and DNA fragmentation occurred. Similar to hepatocytes, cultured liver endothelial cells exhibited blebbing, chromatin condensation and margination, marked nuclear condensation, and increased stainability with Hoechst 33342 when exposed to hypothermia/rewarming. In both cell types, the occurrence and extent of these alterations were dependent on the duration of the cold incubation period. This cold-induced apoptosis was inhibited by hypoxia, by an array of free radical scavengers/antioxidants, and by iron chelators. However, the extent of the protection by the different antioxidants was different in the two cell types: iron chelators provided complete protection in liver endothelial cells but only partial protection in hepatocytes, whereas lipophilic antioxidants such as α-tocopherol provided complete protection in both cell types. During cold incubation, and especially during rewarming, lipid peroxidation occurred. These results suggest that the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a key mediator of cold-induced apoptosis, with ROS formation being completely iron-mediated in liver endothelial cells and partially iron-mediated in hepatocytes.—Rauen, U., Polzar, B., Stephan, H., Mannherz, H.

https://openalex.org/W1553342043,"T cells are considered to be unresponsive to testosterone due to the absence of androgen receptors (AR). Here, we demonstrate the testosterone responsiveness of murine splenic T cells in vitro as well as the presence of unconventional cell surface receptors for testosterone and classical intracellular AR. Binding sites for testosterone on the surface of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets of T cells are directly revealed with the impeded ligand testosterone-BSA-FITC by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry, respectively. Binding of the plasma membrane impermeable testosterone-BSA conjugate induces a rapid rise (<5 s) in [Ca2+]i of Fura-2-loaded T cells. This rise reflects influx of extracellular Ca2+ through non-voltage-gated and Ni2+-blockable Ca2+ channels of the plasma membrane. The testosterone-BSA-induced Ca2+ import is not affected by cyproterone, a blocker of the AR. In addition, AR are not detectable on the surface of intact T cells when using anti-AR antibodies directed against the amino and carboxy terminus of the AR, although T cells contain AR, as revealed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and Western blotting. AR can be visualized with the anti-AR antibodies in the cytoplasm of permeabilized T cells by using CLSM, though AR are not detectable in cytosol fractions when using the charcoal binding assay with 3H-R1881 as ligand. Cytoplasmic AR do not translocate to the nucleus of T cells in the presence of testosterone, in contrast to cytoplasmic AR in human cancer LNCaP cells. These findings suggest that the classical AR present in splenic T cells are not active in the genomic pathway. By contrast, the cell surface receptors for testosterone are in a functionally active state, enabling T cells a nongenomic response to testosterone."

First, ground-state peroxynitrite can oxidize the substrates in a process that is first order in peroxynitrite and first order in substrate. In the second pathway, peroxynitrous acid rearranges in a rate-limiting step into a highly reactive species, which is the ultimate oxidant. This process is first order in peroxynitrite and zero order in substrate (1Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol.

To better understand the mechanisms of peroxynitrite cytotoxicity and its role in pathological processes, it is important to characterize its reactivity toward different biomolecules. In this sense, proteins are key targets of oxidative stress. Exposure to oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide leads to amino acid modifications and subsequent changes in protein structure and function. These alterations have been related to protein turnover, aging, and diverse pathological processes (11Stadtman E.R.

HSA is the most abundant protein in plasma. Its physiological roles include the maintenance of colloid osmotic pressure and the transport of different ligands. In addition, HSA may have important roles as an extracellular antioxidant, by ligating free metals and scavenging reactive species and serving as a transport molecule for nitric oxide. This well characterized 66-kDa protein has 18 tyrosines, 6 methionines, 1 tryptophan, 17 sulfur bridges, and only 1 free cysteine in a total of 585 amino acids, and no prosthetic groups. In this paper, the kinetics of peroxynitrite reaction were studied for all free l-amino acids, HSA, BSA, and their single sulfhydryls. In addition, the influence of carbon dioxide/bicarbonate on the interactions between peroxynitrite and albumin was assessed. This study enables us to rationalize peroxynitrite reactivity toward proteins on kinetic terms and also contributes to understanding the fate of peroxynitrite in the intravascular space. Human and bovine serum albumin (fraction V) were obtained from Sigma. Mercuric chloride was obtained from Merck. To prevent metal interference, 0.1 mmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (dtpa) was added to the solutions. Peroxynitrite was synthesized from hydrogen peroxide and nitrous acid as described (1Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6642) Google Scholar). Contaminating hydrogen peroxide was eliminated with manganese dioxide, and peroxynitrite concentration was determined at 302 nm (ε = 1.67 mm−1 cm−1) (26Hughes M.N. Nicklin H.G. J. Chem. Soc. 1968; : 450-456Crossref Google Scholar). HSA was defatted with charcoal in acid solution (27Chen R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 173-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To reduce sulfhydryls oxidized during purification and storage, HSA was treated overnight with 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C, and excess reductant was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 using 0.01 m potassium phosphate, 0.1 mm dtpa, pH 7.4. HSA typically was 1 mm and had a sulfhydryl to albumin molar ratio (R) of 0.6–0.8, as described previously (1Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sulfhydryl of HSA was blocked by the addition of an equimolar amount of mercuric chloride (HgCl2), leaving no residual sulfhydryls. Alternatively, HSA was incubated for 30 min at 20 °C with a 7-fold excess of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), followed by gel filtration. In this case, the sulfhydryl to albumin ratio was diminished to 0.015. Albumin concentration was measured by absorbance at 279 nm (ε = 0.531 (28Meucci E. Mordente A. Martorana G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4692-4699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.667 (29Peters Jr., T. Putman F.W. The Plasma Proteins. 1. Academic Press, New York1975: 133-181Google Scholar), (g/liter)−1 cm−1 for HSA and BSA, respectively). The molecular weights were 66,486 for HSA (30Bunk D.M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 69: 2457-2463Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and 66,429 for BSA (31Wada Y. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The amino acid compositions were obtained from GenBank (accession numbers A06977 for HSA and M73993 for BSA). Sulfhydryls were quantified using 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (ε412 = 13.6 mm−1cm−1) (32Ellman G. Lysko H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Carbon dioxide-containing solutions were prepared immediately before the experiment and used within 10 min to minimize diffusion of CO2 out of the solution (33Radi R. Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 301: 353-367Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Nitration of tyrosine residues in HSA was assessed by measuring the increase in absorbance at 430 nm after alkalinization to pH ≥ 10 (ε430 = 4.4 mm−1cm−1) (17Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. van der Woerd M. Smith C. Chen J. Harrison J. Martin J.C. Tsai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The kinetics of peroxynitrite decomposition were studied in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, SF17MV) at 302 nm. Fits to kinetic traces were performed with the software provided with the instrument. Time-dependent spectra were obtained with a photodiode array (Applied Photophysics). All experiments were performed at 37 °C, and the pH was measured before and after reactions. Computer simulations for a given reaction scheme and a set of rate constants were produced with Gepasi version 3.1 (34Mendes P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mendes P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative data are reported. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Graphics and mathematical fits to experimental data were performed with SlideWrite (Advanced Graphics Software) or Origin (Microcal Software). The usual approach to study the rate of peroxynitrite reaction with target molecules is through an integral rate method, under pseudo-first order conditions (36Radi R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 354-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite decomposition then follows an exponential functionversus time, and the rate constant is determined through the fit of the kinetic trace to this function. For peroxynitrite reaction with HSA, it was not possible to achieve pseudo-first order conditions, since the limiting maximal concentration of HSA solutions (about 1 mm) did not permit a 10-fold excess over peroxynitrite in stopped-flow experiments. The kinetic traces of peroxynitrite (0.25 mm) decomposition in the presence of 0.139 mmHSA (r = 0.608) (Fig. 1) did not follow a single exponential function, since the logarithmic plots were not linear (Fig. 1 , inset). Rather, the rate of peroxynitrite decay was initially faster as peroxynitrite reacted with both the single sulfhydryl residue present in substoichiometric amounts and with the other amino acids of the protein. When sulfhydryl-blocked HSA was used (pretreated with mercuric chloride), the decay of peroxynitrite was slower than for native HSA. Hence, the kinetics of peroxynitrite-HSA reaction could not be studied through the integral rate method. Instead, an initial rate approach was used, using relatively similar concentrations of peroxynitrite and HSA. Since the absorbance at 302 nm (A) is proportional to peroxynitrite concentration and the change in albumin absorbance is negligible at this wavelength in the experimental conditions, the initial rate of peroxynitrite decomposition would be as shown in Equation 1. −d[ONOO−]0dt=−[ONOO−]0dA/dt(Ao−A∞)=kobs[ONOO−]0Equation 1 where dA/dt is the initial change in absorbance at 302 nm, and A o andA ∞ are the initial and final values, respectively. Following the initial rate assumption that the concentration of reagents remains effectively constant during this period, the rate constant could be determined by Equation 2. kobs=−dA/dt(Ao−A∞)Equation 2 In order to ensure accuracy of the rate constant determinations, 200 absorbance measurements were acquired during the initial part of the reaction (≈20% decrease in peroxynitrite absorbance), and 200 further points were acquired until more than 99.9% of peroxynitrite had decomposed. The initial slopes were determined for the period of linear decrease in absorbance, which corresponded to 10–15% of peroxynitrite decomposition. In the absence of HSA, the rate constants of peroxynitrite decomposition determined from the initial rate method compared well with the values determined from the integral rate method. For instance, the initial rate method yielded values of k obs = 1.11 ± 0.09 s−1 (n = 7), with the integral method giving a k obs of 0.99 ± 0.03 s−1. Differences in the values calculated from both methods were a maximum of 10%, with the initial rate method systematically having a greater degree of dispersion than the integral one, as revealed by the increase in the standard deviation. In the presence of relatively high concentrations of sulfhydryl-blocked HSA, peroxynitrite decay better approximated an exponential function, due to the high overall concentration of target residues. In this case, the values determined through both kinetic approaches were in good agreement. To validate further the initial rate method, we confirmed that values of k obs determined at 320 nm were the same as those determined at 302 nm. For the following reaction schemes (Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5) ONOOH→k1NO3−+H+Equation 3 ONOOH+HSA→k2productsEquation 4 ONOO−+HSA­SH→k3productsEquation 5 k 1, k 2, andk 3 are the rate constants of peroxynitrite isomerization and reaction with sulfhydryl-blocked HSA and with the sulfhydryl, respectively. Defining k′1,k′2, and k′3 as the corresponding apparent rate constants at a fixed given pH of 7.4 and 37 °C, the observed rate constant of peroxynitrite disappearance would be as shown in Equation 6. kobs=k1′+k2′[HSA]+k3′[HSA­SH]Equation 6 Since R was defined as the sulfhydryl to albumin molar ratio, then (see Equation 7) kobs=k1′+(k2′+k3′R)[HSA]Equation 7 As observed in Fig. 2, k obs determined through the initial rate approach increased linearly with HSA concentration, in agreement with Equation 7. For native HSA, the second order rate constant of peroxynitrite reaction with HSA (R = 0.636) at pH 7.47 ± 0.02 and 37 °C was determined from the slope of the plot to be 8.3 ± 0.3 × 103m−1 s−1. The plot was consistently observed to intercept the y axis at a value lower than that for peroxynitrite spontaneous decomposition, as noted previously for other molecules (15Quijano C. Alvarez B. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 37Alvarez B. Denicola A. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 38Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Radi R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1998; 24: 1331-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For sulfhydryl-blocked HSA (pretreated with mercuric chloride), the slope of the plot decreased. In this case, Equation 7 simplifies to Equation 8. kobs=k1′+k2′[HSA]Equation 8 From Equation 8, k′2, the rate constant of peroxynitrite reaction with sulfhydryl-blocked HSA was 5.9 ± 0.3 × 103m−1s−1. According to Equations 7 and 8,k′3, the rate constant of peroxynitrite reaction with the single sulfhydryl of HSA, can be calculated by dividing the difference in the slopes with and without mercury treatment byR. In this way, k′3 was determined to be 3.8 ± 0.8 × 103m−1s−1. By adding the values of the rate constants with sulfhydryl-blocked HSA and with the sulfhydryl, the total rate constant of peroxynitrite reaction with HSA, assuming R = 1, can be calculated to be 9.7 ± 1.1 × 103m−1 s−1. The rate constants of peroxynitrite reaction with BSA at pH = 7.43 ± 0.03 and 37 °C were determined in the same way as with HSA (data not shown), and the total rate constant with BSA (assumingR = 1) was determined to be 7.5 ± 0.8 × 103m−1 s−1. The rate constant with the single sulfhydryl of BSA wask′3 = 3.9 ± 0.5 × 103m−1 s−1. This value is in good agreement with the one determined for HSA and higher than the one reported previously for BSA of 2.6–2.8 × 103m−1 s−1 (1Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate constant for peroxynitrite reaction with sulfhydryl-blocked BSA wask′2 = 3.6 ± 0.3 × 103m−1 s−1, significantly lower than that for HSA and again higher than the previously reported value of 2.5 × 103m−1s−1 (1Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The differences with the previous values are likely to be due to the use of an integral rate approach. The kinetics of peroxynitrite decomposition in the presence of all the l-amino acids was studied under pseudo-first order conditions at pH = 7.40 ± 0.05 and 37 °C. The initial peroxynitrite concentration was 0.2–0.6 mm, and the amino acid concentration ranged from 0 to 100 mm where solubility permitted. Leu, Phe, Met, and Trp were studied at lower concentrations (up to 67, 60, 25, and 3.5 mm, respectively). Tyr and cystine could not be studied because of their low solubility. The decrease in absorbance at 302 nm was monitored for more than 8 t12, and absorbance versus time traces were fitted to a single exponential function in order to obtaink obs. For the amino acid Cys, k obs increased linearly with concentration as before (1Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Met, k obsshowed a hyperbolic plus linear dependence on concentration as previously at 25 °C (16Pryor W.A. Jin X. Squadrito G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11173-11177Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This is the case for Trp as well (19Alvarez B. Rubbo H. Kirk M. Barnes S. Freeman B.A. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), although in this work the low concentration range used in order to prevent interference from nitrotryptophan absorbance did not allow us to observe the linear dependence. Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp, Gln, Glu, Gly, Ile, Lys, Pro, Ser, Thr, and Val displayed hyperbolic behavior, as exemplified for Pro in Fig. 3. His, Leu, and Phe did not affect peroxynitrite decay rate to any detectable extent in the conditions studied. This is expected for Tyr as well according to the results obtained for Phe (this work), phenol, and salicylate (18Ramezanian M.S. Padmaja S. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 160-169Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). From the plots of k obs versus amino acid concentration, three parameters, a 1,a 2, and a 3, were adjusted by nonlinear regression to the function shown in Equation 9. kobs=k1′+a1[aa]a2+[aa]+a3[aa]Equation 9 where [aa] is the amino acid concentration,a 1 represents the difference betweenk obs at infinite (k ∞) and zero (k′1) amino acid concentrations,a 2 represents the concentration of amino acid, where k obs is halfway betweenk′1 and k ∞, anda 3 represents the slope of the linear portion of the plot, when present.

For sulfhydryl-blocked HSA (see Equation 10), then kobs=k1[H+]Ka1+[H+]+k2[H+]Ka2+[H+][HSA]Equation 10 The first term represents the spontaneous decomposition of peroxynitrous acid as first proposed by Keith and Powell (39Keith W.G. Powell R.E. J. Chem. Soc. 1969; : 90Crossref Google Scholar).k 1 and pK a1 at 37 °C were determined in a separate experiment to be 4.6 ± 0.1 s−1 and 6.8 ± 0.1, respectively, in agreement with previous reports (1Radi R.

Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). The second term in Equation 10 represents the reaction with HSA, assuming peroxynitrous acid is the reacting species. The experimental data were fitted to Equation 10. The value ofk 2 determined from the fit was 14.4 ± 0.5 × 103m−1s−1 and pK a2, the apparent pK a of peroxynitrous acid ionization in the presence of HSA, was 7.45 ± 0.05. For native HSA, assuming peroxynitrite anion is reacting with hydronated sulfhydryl (see Equation 11), then kobs=k1[H+]Ka1+[H+]+k2[H+]Ka2+[H+][HSA]+k3Ka1[H+](Ka1+[H+])(Ka3+[H+])R[HSA]Equation 11 In order to fit the experimental data to Equation 11, the values of k 2 and pK a2used were those just determined for sulfhydryl-blocked HSA. Thus,k 3 was 5.0 ± 0.9 × 103m−1 s−1 and the dissociation constant of the sulfhydryl was pK a3 = 8.6 ± 0.4. To confirm these values, k obsfor sulfhydryl-blocked HSA were subtracted fromk obs for native HSA at each pH and divided by the sulfhydryl concentration in order to fit to the following function shown in Equation 12. k3′=kobs(native)−kobs(blocked)R[HSA]=k3Ka1[H+](Ka1+[H+])(Ka3+[H+])Equation 12 Despite the relatively high degree of dispersion arising from data processing, the plot of k′3 as a function of pH fitted this bell-shaped function, with a maximum around pH 7.55 (Fig.4, inset). The values of k 3 and pK a3 were calculated to be 5.5 ± 0.5 × 103m−1s−1and 8.3 ± 0.2, respectively, and are in good agreement with those determined from the fit to Equation 11. With the values of k 3 and pK a3 determined from Fig. 4, it can be calculated from Equation 12 that k′3 at pH = 7.4 would be 3.7 × 103m−1s−1, in accordance with the value of 3.8 ± 0.8 × 103m−1 s−1obtained experimentally at pH 7.4 in Fig. 2. From the data reported in Fig. 4 it cannot be elucidated which the reacting species are, since the pH dependence of the kinetics of peroxynitrite anion reaction with hydronated sulfhydryl are homomorphic with those of peroxynitrous acid reacting with the thiolate. Although Equations 11 and 12 correspond to the former, it can be calculated that for peroxynitrous acid reacting with the thiolate, the pH-independent rate constant would be k 3 = 335 ± 39 × 103m−1 s−1. Since the kinetic constant of peroxynitrite reaction with the single sulfhydryl can account for about 39% of the reactivity of HSA, it could be expected that the sulfhydryl would inhibit nitration of aromatic residues. HSA (0.270 mm, R = 0.526) was reacted with peroxynitrite (1 mm) in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, and time-dependent spectra were recorded throughout th"

NF-κB activation results from sequential phosphorylation and hydrolysis of the cytoplasmic inhibitor, IκBα, through the 26 S proteasome. Here, we show a parallel proteasome-independent pathway for cytokine-inducible IκBα proteolysis in HepG2 liver cells mediated by cytosolic calcium-activated neutral protease (calpains). Pretreatment with either calpain- or proteasome-selective inhibitors partially blocks up to 50% of TNF-α-inducible IκBα proteolysis; pretreatment with both is required to completely block IκBα proteolysis. Similarly, in transient cotransfection assays, expression of the specific inhibitor, calpastatin, partially blocks TNF-α-inducible NF-κB-dependent promoter activity and IκBα proteolysis. In TNF-α-stimulated cells, a rapid (within 1 min), 2.2-fold increase in cytosolic calpain proteolytic activity is measured using a specific fluorescent assay. Inducible calpain proteolytic activity occurs coincidentally with the particulate-to-cytosol redistribution of the catalytic m-calpain subunit into the IκBα compartment. Addition of catalytically active m-calpain into broken cells was sufficient to produce ligand-independent IκBα proteolysis and NF-κB translocation. As additional evidence for calpain-dependent IκBα proteolysis and NF-κB activation, we demonstrate that this process occurs in a cell line (ts20b) deficient in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Following inactivation of the temperature-sensitive ubiquitin-activating enzyme, IκBα proteolysis occurs in a manner sensitive only to calpain inhibitors.

Nonlysosomal (cytoplasmic) protease systems have recently been identified as important regulators of intracellular activities including programmed cell death, protein kinase abundance, and cell-cycle progression (1Croall D.E.

In viable cells, two prominent cytoplasmic protease systems have been identified. These include the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, mediating targeted turnover of misfolded and unstable proteins, and the calcium-activated neutral protease (calpain)-calpastatin system, initially thought to be important in regulating turnover of protein kinases and key structural proteins in the cell (1Croall D.E.

More recently, however, inducible proteolysis has also been shown to be important in hormonal control of gene expression by modulating the nuclear abundance of certain transcription factors.

Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 5Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwartz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). NF-κB, a multiprotein complex inactivated in the cytoplasm by association with its IκB inhibitor, translocates into the nucleus following dissociation of the NF-κB·IκB complex. TNF-α modifies NF-κB·IκB association through a process initiated by inducible IκBα serine phosphorylation on its amino-terminal regulatory domain, a modification coupled to IκB polyubiquitination (Ubn) on adjacent lysine residues (6DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB·IκB dissociation requires IκB proteolysis because phosphorylated and ubiquitinated IκB still inactivates NF-κB (Ref. 6DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Presently, the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been the only pathway identified in mediating cytokine-inducible IκB proteolysis. Pretreatment with cell-permeant proteasome inhibitors blocks TNF-α-inducible IκB proteolysis concomitantly with the accumulation of Ubn- and phosphorylated IκB intermediates (6DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). Independently, inducible IκBα proteolysis in cells harboring thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzymes is markedly slowed at non-permissive temperatures (9Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian A. Ciechanover A. Ben-Neriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10599-10603Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate the presence of alternative (nonproteasome-dependent) processing pathways for IκB proteolysis. First, in pre-B lymphocytes, c-Rel:NF-κB1 is constitutively nuclear as the consequence of a calcium-dependent proteolytic activity that preferentially affects IκBα (rather than IκBβ (10Miyamoto S. Seufzer B.J. Shumway S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Second, we have observed a non-proteasome-dependent pathway mediating inducible IκBα proteolysis (and NF-κB activation) following respiratory syncytial virus infection of human airway epithelial cells (11Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Han Y. Elliott T. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4849-4857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether additional nonproteasome-dependent pathways participate in cytokine-inducible NF-κB activation have not been explored. These studies prompted us to examine whether nonproteasome-dependent pathways participate in cytokine-inducible IκBα degradation. Here we investigate the proteolytic mechanism involved in a well characterized model of NF-κB activation in TNF-α-stimulated HepG2 hepatocytes, where NF-κB activation mediates the expression of acute phase reactants (12Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Brasier A.R. Ron D. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3933-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). By using calpain and proteasome-selective inhibitors, we demonstrate that inducible IκBα proteolysis is partially blocked following inhibition of either pathway and completely blocked following inhibition of both. By using a specific fluorescent assay in intact cells, we describe for the first time that TNF-α rapidly activates cytosolic calpain proteolytic activity. In subcellular fractionations of TNF-α-stimulated cells, the catalytic m-calpain subunit translocates from the particulate into the cytosolic fraction (the latter containing IκBα) coincidentally with IκBα proteolysis. Moreover, TNF-α-inducible IκBα proteolysis occurs in cells conditionally deficient in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and in cells expressing IκBα mutations deficient in proteasome-dependent processing. Together, these data implicate calpains are a parallel pathway in mediating IκBα proteolysis and NF-κB activation. Purified phosphorylated bovine casein (sodium salt) and rabbit skeletal muscle m-calpain (specific activity 30 units/mg protein, >90% 80- and 30-kDa subunits by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were from Sigma and Aldrich. Lactacystin (Lacta), was a generous gift of E. J. Corey (Harvard University). Benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-phenylalaninal (Z-LLF) was a gift of Mark Suto (Signal Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA). Z-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG132, Z-LLL), Z-Leu-norleucinal (calpeptin, Z-LnL),trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanido)butane (E64), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). CBZ-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-tyrosine diazomethyl ketone (Z-LLY) was from Molecular Probes. The temperature-sensitive Balb/c 3T3 cell line, ts20b, and its corrected version transfected with wild-type E1 enzyme, H38–5, was gift from Harvey Ozer (UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School). A reporter plasmid containing −162 to +44 bp of the human IL-8 promoter driving expression of CAT was produced by subcloning the BamHI/HindIII restricted polymerase chain reaction product of the IL-8 gene into the same sites of a pGEMCAT plasmid. For this, an upstream primer 5′-ACTTGGATCCACTCCGTATTTGATAAGG-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and the downstream primer 5′-AGAAGCTTGTGTGCTCTGCTGTCTCTGAA-3′ were used to polymerase chain reaction amplify the IL-8 promoter (11Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Han Y. Elliott T. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4849-4857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids were purified by ion exchange chromatography (Qiagen) and sequenced to verify authenticity prior to transfection. Human HepG2 cells were cultured and stimulated with 30 ng/ml recombinant human TNF-α as described (12Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For protease inhibitor experiments, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 10 μm lactacystin, 10 μm Z-LLF, 25 μm Z-LLL, 10 μmZ-LnL, 50 μm E64, 100 μm PMSF, or 100 μm Z-LLY as indicated. HepG2 cells were transfected usingN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate:DNA liposomes into triplicate 60-mm plates with 20 μg of −162/+44 human IL-8/CAT reporter, 5 μg of SV40-driven alkaline phosphatase internal control, and 4 μg of pcDNA I expression plasmid (InVitrogen). Cells were stimulated with TNF-α for 12 h prior to reporter assay. Where indicated, transiently transfected cells were isolated following cotransfection with 5 μg of plasmid CMV.IL2R encoding the IL-2 receptor. Transient transfectants in 100-mm plates (108 cells) were purified by adding anti-human CD25 (Caltag Laboratories) and captured on magnetic beads conjugated to rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dynabeads, Dynal Inc.) as described (7Padmanabhan R. Howard T. Gottesman M. Howard B.H. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In experiments using ubiquitin pathway-defective ts20b cells and their controls, H38–5, cells were transferred from 32 °C (permissive temperature) to 39 °C (restrictive temperature) for a 6-h period to inactivate the temperature-sensitive E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (14Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with 30 ng/ml TNF-α at 37 °C. Identically treated wild-type E1-corrected H38–5 cells were taken as control. For protease inhibitor experiments, 6-h temperature-restrictedts20b cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37 °C without or with 50 μm Z-LnL, 100 μm E64, 100 μm Z-LLY, 10 μm Lacta, and 100 μm PMSF prior to TNF-α stimulation. Antibodies used were to IκBα (sc-203, recognizing amino acids 6–20, and sc-371, recognizing amino acids 297–317), IκBβ (sc-945, recognizing amino acids 339–358), Rel A (sc-109), Rel B (sc-226) from Santa Cruz Biotech and m-calpain (Research Diagnostics, Inc.). Subunit-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies to recombinant Methanosarcina thermophilia α and β subunits, corresponding to the human proteasome subunit ζ and RING 10, respectively, were obtained from Calbiochem. 200 μg of cytosolic or nuclear extracts were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene membranes (12Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Following incubation with primary antibody, antigens were detected in the enhanced chemiluminescent assay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's recommendations. For proteasome activity, 200 μg of HepG2 lysates from control or TNF-α-treated (30 ng/ml, 15 min) were incubated with 60 μm in 1 ml of ATP-containing reaction buffer (15Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of indicated protease inhibitor (30 min, 30 °C). AMC released was quantitated by measuring fluorescence emission intensity at 440 nm (Iex, 365 nm) normalizing to standards. Results are mean ± S.D. of three experiments. To confirm Suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolyzing activity was dependent on proteasome activity, HepG2 lysate was proteasome-depleted by ultracentrifugation (150,000 × g, 26 h, 4 °C). Western blots before or after ultracentrifugation were done to detect the core proteasome subunits, RING 10 and ζ. Both RING 10 and ζ, present in the crude supernatant, were lost in the S150supernatant and recovered in the 150,000 × g pellet. By contrast, the 80-kDa m-calpain catalytic subunit remained in the S150 supernatant. Ninety four percent of the AMC generation was lost in the S150 supernatant, indicating that proteasome activity was selectively being measured by this assay. For measurement of m-calpain caseinolytic activity, 0.025 units/ml purified human erythrocyte m-calpain was incubated with phosphorylated bovine casein (2 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of indicated inhibitors under standard conditions (4 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, at 30 °C, 1 h). Hydrolysis was quantitated by Coomassie Brilliant Blue colorimetric assay (16Buroker-Kilgore M. Wang K.K.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with purified rabbit skeletal muscle m-calpain (not shown). For HepG2 andts20b cells, calpain activity was measured by the rate of generation of the fluorescent product, AMC, from intracellular thiol-conjugated Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC (17Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were dispersed, grown on glass coverslips, continuously superfused with physiologic saline solution at 37 °C, and sequentially imaged with a quantitative fluorescence imaging system (18Pariat M. Carillo S. Molinari M. Salvat C. Debussche L. Bracco L. Milner J. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2806-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). At t = 0, Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC (10 μm, Molecular Probes) was introduced into the superfusion solution, and mean fluorescence intensity (excitation 350 nm, emission 470 nm) of individual cells was measured at 60-s intervals. At 10 min, TNF-α (30 ng/ml) was added to the superfusion solution with 10 μm Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC. The slope of the fluorescence change with respect to time represents the intracellular calpain activity (17Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the thiol-conjugated substrate was rate-limiting for the generation of fluorescent product as shown by comparing the initial rate of cell fluorescence increase after exposure to Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC with that produced by CMAC. CMAC requires only the thiol conjugation step, not hydrolysis, for fluorescence. There was a 35.8-fold increase in the AMC fluorescence rate compared with Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC, demonstrating that hydrolysis and not conjugation was rate-limiting. For calpain assays in whole cell populations, suspension cultures of HepG2 cells were loaded with 10 μm Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC, and changes in intracellular fluorescence was measured prior to and after TNF-α addition at 37 °C using a FACS Vantage system. Cellular fluorescence of AMC was measured using a 360-nm excitation filter and a 405-nm long-pass emission filter. Two hundred μg of protein 100,000 × g supernatant (S100) was incubated with 150 ng of recombinant human IκBα for indicated times in Reaction Buffer (RB, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 65 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) at 32 °C in a final volume of 60 μl. IκBα degradation was quantitated by Western immunoblot. Indicated amounts of purified rabbit skeletal muscle m-calpain was added to a mixture of 200 μg of HepG2 cytosol and 1 × 106 sucrose cushion-purified nuclei (12Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in 10% glycerol-containing RB (100 μl, 32 °C). IκB proteolysis in cytoplasmic extract and nuclear Rel A was analyzed by Western immunoblot following sucrose-cushion purification of nuclei (12Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assay was performed using the NF-κB-binding site from the angiotensinogen promoter as described (12Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that administration of TNF-α (30 ng/ml) to HepG2 cells induces rapid IκB (α and β) proteolysis and NF-κB translocation, maximally detectable 15 min following addition of hormone (12Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To examine initially if proteasome-independent pathways for IκB proteolysis exist, IκB abundance was assayed by Western immunoblots in protease inhibitor pretreated cells harvested 15 min after TNF-α stimulation. A battery of previously characterized proteasome (lactacystin, Z-LLF, Z-LLL (8Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 15Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L.

Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar)), calpain (Z-LnL (20Tsujinaka T. Kajiwara J. Sakon M. Higuchi N. Tanaka T. Mori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), E64), and nonspecific serine protease (PMSF) inhibitors were used (Fig.1 a). In data not shown, pretreatment with these agents had no effect on constitutive (nonstimulated) levels of either IκB isoform. In the absence of protease inhibitors, TNF-α produced rapid proteolysis of both 37-kDa IκBα and 49-kDa IκBβ (compare lanes 1 and2). Pretreatment with lactacystin, Z-LLF, or Z-LLL blocked IκBβ processing (compare lane 2 with 3–5), whereas Z-LnL, E64, and PMSF had no effect. These observations are consistent with a predominant role of the proteasome pathway mediating IκBβ proteolysis (6DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, IκBα proteolysis was partially blocked by the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and Z-LLF (Fig. 1 a, lanes 3 and 4). Of the presumed proteasome-selective inhibitors, only Z-LLL was a completely effective inhibitor of IκBα proteolysis. Surprisingly, moreover, the calpain inhibitors Z-LnL and E64 also partially blocked IκBα proteolysis, even under conditions where IκBβ proteolysis was unaffected (compare lane 2with 6 and 7). These data suggest a parallel contribution of calpain-like proteases in TNF-α-inducible IκBα hydrolysis. To define the kinetics of proteasome-independent pathways mediating IκBα proteolysis, IκBα half-life in TNF-α-treated cells was compared in cells containing with that in cells lacking proteasome activity (Fig. 1 b). In cells not treated with protease inhibitors, IκBα proteolysis is rapid ( t12 of 1–3 min), occurring coincidentally with the generation of phosphorylated IκBα intermediates (Fig. 1 b, IκBαP). In cells pretreated with the potent irreversible proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, IκBα proteolysis occurs with a detectably slower half-life ( t12 of 7–15 min) and is incomplete, with the appearance of a <30-kDa intermediate (Fig. 1 b, bottom). To determine whether any pathway other than the combined calpain/proteasome account for IκBα proteolysis, the additive effects of the specific irreversible calpain inhibitor Z-LLY (21Mellgren R.L. Lu Q. Zhang W. Lakkis M. Shaw E. Mericle M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15568-15574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and lactacystin were studied (Fig. 1 c). At saturating doses, neither Z-LLY nor lactacystin alone could completely inhibit IκBα proteolysis. In the presence of both inhibitor types, IκBα proteolysis was completely blocked with accumulation of non- and phosphorylated IκBα intermediates (Fig.1 c). We note consistently that IκBαPintermediate was detectable at the 15-min time point in the presence of proteasome inhibitors but not in calpain inhibitors (see “Discussion”). Enzymatic activity of calpains are influenced by the effect of endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin. As additional evidence for the role of calpains in NF-κB activation, the effect of transiently expressed calpastatin was determined on NF-κB-dependent reporter activity in transient cotransfection assay (18Pariat M. Carillo S. Molinari M. Salvat C. Debussche L. Bracco L. Milner J. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2806-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22Maglova L.M. Jackson A.M. Meng X.J. Carruth M.W. Schteingart C.D. Ton-Nu H.T. Hofmann A.F. Weinman S.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 637-647PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the human IL-8 promoter is TNF-α-inducible in a manner solely dependent on a high affinity NF-κB site (23Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3551-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of calpastatin expression plasmid (pcDNA I-calpastatin) did not affect basal IL-8/CAT activity but significantly blocked TNF-α-inducible CAT activity (Fig. 1 d). As a control, the effect of calpastatin on IκBα steady state levels was measured in transient transfectants. HepG2 cells cotransfected with IL-2 receptor expression plasmid in the absence or presence of various concentrations of pcDNA I-calpastatin were stimulated with TNF-α. Following isolation of transfected cells, a Western immunoblot was done to determine changes in IκBα in cytosolic lysates (Fig.1 e). In the presence of 2.5 μg of pcDNA I-calpastatin, IκBα proteolysis was inhibited by ∼50%. Combined, these data strongly suggest a parallel contribution of the calpain system in TNF-α-inducible proteolysis of IκBα and NF-κB activation. The specificity and effect of protease inhibitors for proteasome and calpain activities were directly measured in vitro (Fig.2). Hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC was used to measure proteasome activity in whole cell lysates (15Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 19Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” following proteasome depletion, 94% of the Suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolyzing activity was depleted, indicating that the assay is measuring bona fide proteasome activity. As shown in Fig. 2 a, in both control and TNF-α-treated cells, Suc LLVY-AMC hydrolytic activity was indistinguishable (12.5 and 13 nmol/min/mg, respectively). Also, greater than 90% inhibition of proteasome activity was seen following lactacystin, Z-LLF, and Z-LLL treatment, indicating these inhibitors potently inhibited (whereas Z-LnL, E64, Z-LLY and PMSF had no effect) cellular proteasome activity. This effect was consistent for either control or TNF-α-stimulated cells. Caseinolytic activity of purified m-calpain was measured in the presence of the same inhibitors (Fig. 2 b). Surprisingly, the presumed “selective” proteasome inhibitors Z-LLF and Z-LLL, as well as the calpain inhibitors Z-LnL, E64, and Z-LLY, were potent inhibitors of m-calpain. Only lactacystin, therefore, was able to differentiate calpain from proteasome activity, and Z-LnL, E64, and Z-LLY, conversely, were specific for caseinolytic activity of calpain, without effects on the proteasome. Direct measurement of dynamic changes in intracellular calpain activity in broken cells has been hampered due to the presence of endogenous calpastatin inhibitor that rapidly associates with active calpains following cell disruption. However, the recent development of a specific fluorescent assay using a cell-permeant calpain substrate to measure changes in calpain proteolytic activity has obviated the need for broken cell assays (17Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After diffusion of the substrate, Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC, into cells, it is conjugated with glutathione (GSH) to form a membrane-impermeant, nonfluorescent calpain substrate. Following its hydrolysis, the unquenched fluorescent product (AMC-GSH) accumulates, where its rate of accumulation is a measure of intracellular calpain activity (17Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specificity of this assay for calpain has been previously demonstrated by its inhibition by the specific calpain inhibitor, Z-LLY, and independence from lysosomal, serine, or cathepsin proteases (17Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A basal rate of generation of AMC-GSH was observed in individual cells (Fig.3 a, 1–10 min). We further examined the assay specificity by measuring the effects of inhibitors on basal proteolytic activity. Basal generation of the fluorescent proteolysis product is calcium-dependent due to the inhibitory effects of the intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester (76% inhibition, 100 μm(n = 30)) and is quantitatively inhibited by the calpain inhibitors, Z-LnL (59% inhibition at 100 mm(n = 40) and 93% at 200 μm(n = 30)) and Z-LLY (62% inhibition at 100 μm (n = 70)), and not inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (0% inhibition at 10 μm (n = 20)). In individual cells, TNF-α increased calpain"
https://openalex.org/W2076831743,"ClC-4 and ClC-5, together with ClC-3, form a distinct branch of the CLC chloride channel family. Although ClC-5 was shown to be mainly expressed in endocytotic vesicles, expression of ClC-5 in Xenopus oocytes elicited chloride currents. We now show that ClC-4 also gives rise to strongly outwardly rectifying anion currents when expressed in oocytes. They closely resemble ClC-5 currents with which they share a NO3− > Cl− > Br− > I− conductance sequence that differs from that reported for the highly homologous ClC-3. Both ClC-4 and ClC-5 currents are reduced by lowering extracellular pH. We could measure similar currents after expressing either channel in HEK293 cells. To demonstrate that these currents are directly mediated by the channel proteins, we introduced several point mutations that change channel characteristics. In ClC-5, several point mutations alter the kinetics of activation but leave macroscopic rectification and ion selectivity unchanged. A mutation (N565K) equivalent to a mutation reported to have profound effects on ClC-3 does not have similar effects on ClC-5. Moreover, a mutation at the end of D2 (S168T in ClC-5) changes ion selectivity, and a mutation at the end of D3 (E211A in ClC-5 and E224A in ClC-4) changes voltage dependence and ion selectivity. This shows that ClC-4 and ClC-5 can directly mediate plasma membrane currents. ClC-4 and ClC-5, together with ClC-3, form a distinct branch of the CLC chloride channel family. Although ClC-5 was shown to be mainly expressed in endocytotic vesicles, expression of ClC-5 in Xenopus oocytes elicited chloride currents. We now show that ClC-4 also gives rise to strongly outwardly rectifying anion currents when expressed in oocytes. They closely resemble ClC-5 currents with which they share a NO3− > Cl− > Br− > I− conductance sequence that differs from that reported for the highly homologous ClC-3. Both ClC-4 and ClC-5 currents are reduced by lowering extracellular pH. We could measure similar currents after expressing either channel in HEK293 cells. To demonstrate that these currents are directly mediated by the channel proteins, we introduced several point mutations that change channel characteristics. In ClC-5, several point mutations alter the kinetics of activation but leave macroscopic rectification and ion selectivity unchanged. A mutation (N565K) equivalent to a mutation reported to have profound effects on ClC-3 does not have similar effects on ClC-5. Moreover, a mutation at the end of D2 (S168T in ClC-5) changes ion selectivity, and a mutation at the end of D3 (E211A in ClC-5 and E224A in ClC-4) changes voltage dependence and ion selectivity. This shows that ClC-4 and ClC-5 can directly mediate plasma membrane currents.

Dent's disease is an X chromosome-linked disorder and has two main symptoms: hypercalciuria, which leads to kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure, and second, low molecular weight proteinuria (7Scheinman S. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 3-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The proteinuria points to a defect in endocytosis of proximal tubular cells. Indeed, ClC-5 is expressed in the proximal tubule and in intercalated cells of the distal nephron (8Günther W. Lüchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Both cell types are involved in endocytosis. The localization of ClC-5 in intracellular vesicles and its co-localization with the proton pump suggests that it provides an electrical shunt necessary for an efficient acidification of these vesicles. This defect in intravesicular acidification probably leads to the impaired endocytosis of proteins observed in Dent's disease. In transfected cells, ClC-5 was present in intracellular vesicles. In addition, there was also some labeling of the plasma membrane (8Günther W. Lüchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Consistent with a plasma membrane localization, expression of ClC-5 inXenopus oocytes elicited chloride currents (9Steinmeyer K.

These had a NO3− > Cl− > Br− > I− conductance sequence and were strongly outwardly rectifying. Currents were detectable only at voltages more positive than +20 mV.

In contrast to ClC-1 mutations in myotonia (13Pusch M. Steinmeyer K. Koch M.C. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1455-1463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), we never found changes in rectification, voltage dependence, or ion selectivity. Thus, we could not rule out the possibility that these currents were mediated by a different channel that was activated by expressing ClC-5. Mutations compromising ClC-5 function would then change those currents quantitatively without changing their characteristics. Given that ClC-5 plays a role in endocytosis (8Günther W. Lüchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), ClC-5 expression may change the plasma membrane localization of channels that are endogenous to the expression system. Thus, identifying mutations that change current characteristics seemed of high priority. Despite these open questions, ClC-5 is the best understood member of the ClC-3/4/5 branch of the CLC gene family. These three proteins are about 80% identical (9Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we did not observe currents upon ClC-4 expression (14Jentsch T.J. Günther W. Pusch M. Schwappach B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 19S-25SCrossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). While some groups reported that ClC-3 expression gave no currents (14Jentsch T.J. Günther W. Pusch M. Schwappach B. J. Physiol.

These authors introduced a mutation into ClC-3 that was equivalent to a mutation changing pore properties in other CLC channels (20Pusch M. Ludewig U. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J.

Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The present study has two major aims. First, to compare several electrophysiological properties of currents elicited by these highly homologous proteins. Second, to prove that these currents are directly due to these gene products by introducing mutations that change their properties. For the first time, ClC-4 gave chloride currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or HEK293 cells. These resemble ClC-5 currents in many respects, but differ slightly in voltage dependence and pH sensitivity. Using various point mutations we demonstrate that these currents are indeed mediated by ClC-4 and ClC-5. Surprisingly, their properties differ significantly from those reported for ClC-3 (16Kawasaki M. Uchida S. Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Marumo F. Sasaki S.

Nature. 1997; 390: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and we could not detect currents upon ClC-3 expression. A human ClC-4 cDNA was cloned into pTLN (23Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) or pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI). It differed from the published sequence (24van Slegtenhorst M.A. Bassi M.T. Borsani G. Wapenaar M.C. Ferrero G.B. de Concilis L. Rugarli E.I. Grillo A. Franco B. Zoghbi H.Y. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number X77197) at the following residues: Ala instead of Arg (GenBankTM) at 178; Ile-Ile instead of Tyr-Tyr at 498 and 499; and Lys instead of Asn at 659. The residues we found are also present in the rat (GenBankTM accession number Z36944) and mouse (GenBankTM accession number S47327) cDNAs. The 5′ end of ClC-4 contains three ATGs in frame (at amino acid numbers 1, 7, and 14; the last one corresponds to the ClC-5 initiator ATG). We could not detect functional differences between these and therefore used the first ATG for all subsequent studies. Amino acids are numbered starting from this methionine. Mutations were introduced by recombinant polymerase chain reaction. All polymerase chain reaction-derived fragments were fully sequenced. The cDNA of ClC-5 contained the rat sequence between the initiator ATG and the DraIII restriction site, which is 100% identical to the human sequence on the protein level. Using SP6 RNA polymerase capped cRNA was transcribed from the constructs after linearization. 10–25 ng of cRNA were injected into Xenopus oocytes isolated by manual defolliculation as described (1Jentsch T.J. Steinmeyer K. Schwarz G. Nature. 1990; 348: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Oocytes were kept at 17 °C in modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements were performed at room temperature 2–3 days after injection using Turbotec 05 or 10C amplifiers (NPI Instruments, Tamm, Germany) and pClamp 5.5 software (Axon Instruments). Currents were recorded in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4). For anion replacement, 80 mm Cl− was substituted by equivalent amounts of Br−, I−, NO3−, or glutamate. When using different pH values, 5 mm HEPES (for pH 7.4) were replaced by 5 mm MES (for pH 6.5 and 5.5) or 5 mm TAPS (for pH 8.5). Permeability coefficients were calculated from reversal potential measurements under biionic conditions using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (25Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2 nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with ClC-4 or ClC-5 cDNA (WT or mutants, subcloned into pCIneo) using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer′s procedures. To identify transfectants, a green fluorescent protein construct (pEGFP;CLONTECH) was co-transfected. Whole cell patch-clamp measurements were performed 30–72 h after transfection at room temperature in an extracellular solution containing 140 mm NMDG, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments) and pClamp5.5 software. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass to 2–5 μm tip diameter and filled with either high-Cl intracellular solution (140 mm NMDG, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) or low-Cl intracellular solution (120 mm NMDG-aspartate, 20 mm NMDG-Cl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES pH 7.4). Pipette resistances were in the range of 1–5 MΩ. Data were usually digitized at 2 kHz frequency after filtering at 1 kHz. To reinvestigate the functional expression of ClC-4, we cloned the human ClC-4 cDNA into an optimized expression vector (23Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and injected derived cRNA into Xenopus oocytes. After 2–3 days, two-electrode voltage-clamping revealed strongly outwardly rectifying chloride currents (Fig. 1 a) that were absent from control oocytes. Currents activated rapidly at positive voltages and in many respects resemble ClC-5 currents (9Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). No tail currents could be detected when stepping back to negative voltages. Similar currents were observed when ClC-4 or ClC-5 were studied in transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, c andd, respectively). This excludes that these currents are due to the activation of a chloride channel specific for Xenopusoocytes. Since the intracellular solution is buffered with EGTA, both channels do not depend on intracellular calcium. In contrast to ClC-5, where currents begin to activate at voltages more positive than +20 mV ((9) and Fig. 1 e), ClC-4-induced currents are already visible at slightly more negative potentials and depend less steeply on voltage (Fig. 1 e). Partial replacement of extracellular chloride by other anions indicated a NO3− > Cl− > Br− > I− conductance sequence (Fig.1 b). This is again similar to ClC-5 (9Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and readily distinguishes these currents from outwardly rectifying, endogenous oocyte currents that display an I− > Cl−conductance (9Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It is not possible to determine permeability ratios as both channels do not mediate large enough currents at the chloride equilibrium potential. Currents mediated by either ClC-4 or ClC-5 are markedly reduced by extracellular acidification (Fig. 2). A similar pH sensitivity was recently described for a XenopusCLC channel that may be the species homolog of ClC-5 (26Schmieder S. Lindenthal S. Banderali U. Ehrenfeld J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 379-393Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ClC-5 currents respond to pH changes already in the neutral range and are reduced to less than 50% at pH 5.5 (Fig. 2 a). By contrast, ClC-4 currents are nearly unaffected in the neutral pH range, and currents begin to decrease when extracellular pH drops below pH 6.5 (Fig. 2 b). We could not measure currents at more acidic pH reliably because currents in Xenopus oocytes became unstable. Nonetheless, our results suggest that the pH dependence of ClC-4 is shifted toward more acidic pH values when compared with ClC-5 (Fig. 2 c). Although the rather subtle differences between the currents induced by ClC-4 and ClC-5 suggest that they are directly mediated by these proteins, we sought more definitive evidence from mutational analysis. Mutations associated with Dent's disease either abolished or reduced ClC-5 currents without changing their biophysical properties (6Lloyd S.E. Pearce S.H.S. Fisher S.E. Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B.

Kidney Int. 1998; 54 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). S244L and S520P are mutations that resulted in reduced but otherwise typical currents (6Lloyd S.E. Pearce S.H.S. Fisher S.E. Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Scheinman S.J. Harding B. Bolino A. Devoto M. Goodyer P. Rigden S.P.A. Wrong O. Jentsch T.J. Craig I.W. Thakker R.V. Nature. 1996; 379: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The mutated amino acids are located in putative transmembrane domains D5 and D11, respectively (Fig.3 f). We mutated these critical residues to other amino acids (alanine and threonine). While S244A currents were similar to WT (Fig. 3 a), the other mutations significantly slowed the activation of ClC-5 (Fig. 3, b,c, and d). This was observed both in transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3) and in Xenopus oocytes (not shown). However, we did not find changes in ion selectivity or in steady-state rectification. As with WT channels, we could not use tail currents to measure the rectification of the open pore. Residues affecting ion selectivity and rectification were found in several regions of CLC channels (27Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The first mutation shown to affect pore properties was K519Q (and K519E) in ClC-0 (20Pusch M. Ludewig U. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This lysine at the end of a large transmembrane block is conserved within ClC-0, -1, -2, and the two ClC-K isoforms. Both mutations reduced the Cl− > I− selectivity of ClC-0, introduced an outward rectification, slowed gating, and reduced its single channel conductance (20Pusch M. Ludewig U. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 27Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 28Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In ClC-3, -4, and -5, an asparagine is present at the equivalent position. We changed this asparagine to a lysine in ClC-5 (N565K). Its effect may be opposite to that of K519Q, particularly since the effect of that ClC-0 mutation may be due to the charge of the side chain (28Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This would predict a more linear I − V relationship and an increase in the Cl−/I− conductance ratio. However, this is not the case. While the N565K mutation slightly slowed the activation of ClC-5 currents (Fig. 3 e), it did not change the overall rectification (Figs. 3 e and 4 a). It slightly increased the relative iodide conductance (Fig.4 a). Thus, it is not a mirror image of the Torpedo K519Q mutation. Nevertheless, it shows that these currents are directly mediated by ClC-5 and that residues at the end of D12 influence pore properties. Several other regions modulate CLC pore properties. In ClC-0, a conservative mutation (S123T) in a highly conserved stretch (GSGIPE) at the end of D2 increases bromide and iodide conductances relative to chloride (27Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The equivalent mutation (S168T) also reduces the ion selectivity of ClC-5 (Fig. 4 b). At positive voltages, bromide and iodide conductances are increased with respect to chloride, an effect that is more drastic than that of the ClC-0 S123T mutation (27Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Several studies (19Fahlke C. Yu H.T. Beck C.L. Rhodes T.H. George A.L.

A. 1997; 94: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) reported that mutations in another highly conserved region, GKEGP at the end of D3, also have effects on gating and pore properties. We mutated the glutamate to alanine in ClC-4 (E224A) and in ClC-5 (E211A). There was a drastic effect on gating (Fig. 4, c and d). Both channels now mediate significant currents in the negative voltage range. We could not detect significant current relaxations, suggesting that gating is now either substantially faster or does no longer depend on voltage. There was also a slight increase in bromide conductance at positive voltages, the only range where a comparison to WT channels is possible (Fig. 4,e and f). The changed voltage dependence allowed us to measure permeability ratios that indicated a NO3− (1.5) = Br− (1.45) > Cl− (1.0) = I− ratio for ClC-4(E224A), and a Br− (1.2) > Cl− (1.0) = NO3− > I− (0.7) sequence for ClC-5(E211A). It is unclear how these differ from the WT permeabilities which cannot be measured. Given the strong similarity between ClC-4 and ClC-5 currents, it is surprising that ClC-3 was reported to elicit less strongly rectifying channels with an I− > Cl− selectivity (16Kawasaki M.

Genomics. 1995; 27: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were unable to obtain ClC-3 currents in Xenopus oocytes. We have now repeated these experiments with human and guinea pig (18Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B.

We again failed to observe currents with human ClC-3 in Xenopusoocytes. Attempts to express chloride currents with the guinea pig ClC-3 in transiently transfected HEK293 or NIH3T3 cells were unsuccessful as well. ClC-4 and ClC-5, together with ClC-3, form a distinct branch of the CLC gene family (2Jentsch T.J. Günther W. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This branch has received much attention because ClC-5 mutations cause Dent's disease (6Lloyd S.E. Pearce S.H.S. Fisher S.E. Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Scheinman S.J. Harding B. Bolino A. Devoto M.

Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) to represent the long sought swelling-activated chloride channel. ClC-4 did not elicit currents in previous studies, and attempts to express ClC-3 gave conflicting results (9Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, a formal proof that the strongly outwardly rectifying currents provoked by ClC-5 are directly mediated by this channel was missing. We now demonstrate that both ClC-4 and ClC-5 directly mediate plasma membrane currents that are very similar. This includes their extreme outward rectification, the lack of significant tail currents, and the NO3− > Cl− > Br− > I− conductance sequence at strongly depolarizing potentials. Both ClC-4 and ClC-5 currents were sensitive to extracellular pH. However, they are not identical. Given these differences, it is unlikely that both proteins activate an identical endogenous oocyte channel, an otherwise frequently observed phenomenon with Xenopus oocytes (32Buyse G. Voets T. Tytgat J. De Greef C. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Eggermont J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3615-3621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This is also unlikely in view of the very similar currents in different expression systems (Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells). The observed pH dependence of ClC-4 and ClC-5 possibly points to an important physiological role of these channels. ClC-5 is expressed in the endocytotic pathway where it may provide the electrical shunt necessary for an efficient acidification of the vesicle interior (8Günther W. Lüchow A. Cluzeaud F.

Seven sequences with the best matches to the methyltransferase consensus motifs were selected for further study. We prepared yeast disruption mutants of each of the genes encoding these sequences, and we found that disruption of the YJL125c gene is lethal, whereas disruptions of YCR047c and YDR140w lead to slow growth phenotypes. Normal growth was observed when the YDL201w, YDR465c, YHR209w, and YOR240w genes were disrupted. Initial analysis of protein methylation patterns of all mutants by amino acid analysis revealed that the YDR465c mutant has a defect in the methylation of the δ-nitrogen atom of arginine residues. We propose that YDR465c codes for the methyltransferase responsible for this recently characterized type of protein methylation, and we designate the enzyme as Rmt2 (protein arginine methyltransferase). In addition, we show that the methylation of susceptible residues in Rmt2 substrates is likely to take place on nascent polypeptide chains and that these substrates exist in the cell as fully methylated species. Interestingly, Rmt2 has 27% sequence identity over 138 amino acids to the mammalian guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase, an enzyme responsible for methylating the δ-nitrogen of the small molecule guanidinoacetate.

The recent explosion in the number of uncharacterized genes resulting from sequencing of entire genomes presents a new challenge in biology. Although several living organisms can now be completely defined in terms of their genetic codes, understanding the functions and interactions of macromolecules encoded by the multitude of genes is in its infancy. Methods are needed to assign function to new gene products in order to come closer to understanding what makes up a living system. With this goal in mind, we wanted to assign function to a fraction of the new sequences, specifically toS-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for which the complete genome has recently been reported (1Goffeau A. et al.Nature. 1997; 387 (suppl.): 1-105Google Scholar). A large class of AdoMet 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; [3H]AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ORF, open reading frame. -dependent methyltransferases have been found to share a conserved catalytic domain structure due to the interaction of the enzymes with a common cofactor, S-adenosylmethionine (2Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To date, the structures of nine AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases have been solved, and they show a similar folding pattern with a central parallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helces (3Cheng X.

The common three-dimensional structure of these enzymes is reflected in sequence motifs that are conserved among a large number of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (12Ingrosso D. Fowler A.V.

Takata Y. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The conserved regions, which we have previously designated as motifs I, post-I, II, and III (15Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), are always found in the same order on the polypeptide chain and are separated by comparable intervals. The three-dimensional structures of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases have revealed that motif I and post-I interact directly with AdoMet, whereas motifs II and III interact with each other and with a portion of motif I to form the central portion of the β-sheet (Fig.1). By using the conserved motifs, we could theoretically identify all of the AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases in S. cerevisiae which belong to the major supergroup of methyltransferases that share this common structural organization. In previous studies, we have successfully predicted several open reading frames to be yeast methyltransferases based on the conserved sequence motifs. For example, YBR236c (L12000 (GB)), which we predicted to be a methyltransferase (15Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) was later found to be an mRNA cap methyltransferase (18Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similarly, YML008c (YYAP_Yeast (SW)) was subsequently shown to be a sterol methyltransferase (15Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 19Hardwick K.G. Pelham H.R. Yeast. 1994; 10: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). While we were compiling a list of putative methyltransferases for the present study, one of the sequences on our list, YML110c, was found to code for a methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone (20Barkovich R.J.

Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). There are now a limited number of methyltransferases in S. cerevisiae for which the corresponding genes have been identified (Table I). About half of these methyltransferases contain identifiable sequence motifs. The enzymes lacking motifs may have three-dimensional structures distinct from the family of methyltransferases for which the crystal structures are known or may have diverged sufficiently for the motifs to become unrecognizable. In addition to the enzymes for which the gene sequence has been described, several other methyltransferases are known based on characterization of the enzyme itself or on the presence of methyl groups on a substrate molecule (Table I). Putative methyltransferase genes identified by sequence motifs can be correlated with these activities by the analysis of their disruption mutants.Table IAdoMet-dependent methyltransferases in S. cerevisiaeEnzymeEC numberGeneMotifsaND, not detected.

Open table in a new tab In this paper, we take advantage of the completion of the yeast genome sequence to analyze directly all of the open reading frames for potential methyltransferases. We present the identification of 33 sequences that contain conserved methyltransferase motifs. Seven of the sequences represent known methyltransferases and 26 are either proteins of unknown function or proteins not previously associated with methylation. We describe the construction of yeast disruption mutants of seven genes possessing the best matches to the consensus motifs. We find that one of the yeast disruptions is lethal and two others lead to slow growth phenotypes. A fourth disruption mutant in theYDR465c gene shows a protein methylation defect in a recently characterized amino acid derivative where the methyl group is present on the δ-nitrogen atom of arginine residues (41Zobel-Thropp P. Gary J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29283-29286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Previously, arginine methylation was only described on the ω-guanidino nitrogens of arginine residues by enzymes such as the yeast Rmt1 methyltransferase (22Gary J.D. Lin W.-J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 42Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although methylation of the δ-nitrogen atom on the small molecule guanidinoacetate is known to occur (43Isbrandt D. von Figura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that the YDR465c gene encodes the methyltransferase activity responsible for this modification, and we designate the gene for this novel enzyme as RMT2 (protein arginine methyltransferase). Analyses of the other disruption strains have provided some clues to the possible function of their corresponding methyltransferases. The genes designated as F1, F7, F8,F10, and F12 were subcloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Table II). Each gene was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA using primers containing aBamHI site in the 5′ primer and EcoRI site in the 3′ primer (Table III). PCR products and the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were digested withBamHI and EcoRI, and gene inserts were ligated into the pGEX-2T vector in frame with the glutathioneS-transferase coding region to allow for expression of each gene as a fusion protein. DH5α cells were transformed with each ligation mixture, and the plasmids containing gene insertsF1, F7, F8, F10, andF12 were designated pAN102, -100, -106, -107, and -108, respectively (Table IV).Table IICloning strategy for yeast disruptions of 7 putative methyltransferasesORFCodeSizeCloning vectorDisruption sitesaThere are two Bg1II sites in F4; therefore, insertion of the TRP1 marker results in the deletion of a 218-base pair fragment.

The resulting plasmids were designated pAN130 and pAN120. The yeast expression vector containing F3 was constructed by cutting the gene out from the vector pAN109 with BamHI and ligating it into the BamHI site of pCH1 (Table IV). The forward orientation of the insert was confirmed by restriction digests, and the resulting plasmid was designated pAN132. The yeast strain AN3-S was transformed with pAN132 or pCH1 as described below for yeast disruptions and selected on uracil-deficient SD plates to make the yeast strains AN-SR2 and AN-SV2, respectively (Table IV). Yeast disruption was carried out using the one-step technique described previously (50Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). Disruption constructs were created by inserting auxotrophic markers into the middle of the coding region for each gene at a specific restriction site (Table II). The auxotrophically selectable markers for disruption wereTRP1 or HIS3 and were obtained from YDp plasmids (44Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) either directly by digesting at BamHI sites or by PCR amplification using the YDp vectors as templates. The primers used for amplification of auxotrophic markers contained restriction sites (BspEI, ClaI, or NcoI) required for subsequent ligation of each marker into a matching site in the gene (Tables II and III). One primer was used in each PCR reaction because the sequences flanking the auxotrophic markers on YDp vectors are identical. However, to amplify HIS3 for F7disruption, two primers, HIS/BspEI.1 and HIS/BspEI.2, were used (TableIII). For versatility, PCR products of the markers were subcloned into either the pCR2.1 vector (original TA cloning vector, Invitrogen) to create plasmids pAN116 and pAN121 or into pBluescript to create pAN099 (Table IV). Each auxotrophic marker was cut out of its plasmid at the appropriate restriction sites as needed for disruption. The disruption constructs were created by linearizing each of the vectors containing one of the seven genes at a restriction site in the middle of the coding region (Table II). The gene F4contained two BglII sites, and therefore, digestion of the pAN120 vector resulted in the deletion of a 218-base pair fragment (Table II). An auxotrophic marker with matching restriction sites at each end was then obtained from the plasmids pAN116, pAN121, and pAN099 (Table IV) by digesting with the appropriate restriction enzyme and ligating the marker into one of the linearized vectors. In cases whereBglII sites were used for disruption (F1 andF4; Table II), the auxotrophic marker was obtained from one of the YDp vectors by digesting with BamHI and ligating the marker directly into the BglII sites. Disruption constructs were released from each vector usingBamHI and either EcoRI or SmaI (TableII). The disruption mutants of S. cerevisiae were created in the strain SEY6210 or in JDG9100-2, a strain defective in arginine methylation (Table IV). For diploid disruptions of F4 andF10, the strain GPY278 was used (Table IV). The transformation protocol involved a simplified lithium acetate procedure as described (51Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were selected on tryptophan or histidine-deficient SD plates using an amino acid dropout mix (Bio 101). The transformants were replated at least 3 times before they were confirmed by Southern blot or PCR. The yeast strains are listed in Table IV. The strain SEY6210-R was created in the strain SEY6210 as described previously (22Gary J.D. Lin W.-J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) in order to disrupt the chromosomalRMT1 gene and was confirmed by PCR and by amino acid analysis of methylarginines (22Gary J.D.

Sporulation and tetrad analyses were conducted as described by Sherman and Hicks (52Sherman F. Hicks J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A haploid disruption mutant of F10 (AN10-S; Table IV) was obtained by sporulating the strain AN10 (Table IV) and isolating a spore with the genotypeMATα, leu2-3, 112,ura3-52, his3-Δ200, trp1-Δ901,lys2-801, suc2-Δ9, mel,F10::TRP1. The isogenic strain SEY6210 was used as a control strain for characterization of AN10-S. S. cerevisiae mutant and parent cells were labeled in vivousing [3H]AdoMet. Cells were grown to early log phase (A 600 nm = 0.6–0.8) in YPD media (1% bacto-yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% dextrose) at 30 °C. FiveA 600 nm units of each culture were then harvested by centrifugation at 1,600 × g for 6 min at 25 °C. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 820 μl of YPD, and 180 μl of [3H]AdoMet (NEN Life Science Products, 77.9 Ci/mmol, 550 μCi/ml in 10 mmH2SO4/ethanol (9:1, v/v)) was added. Cells were labeled for 30 min at 30 °C with shaking, pelleted at 16,000 ×g for 5 s at 25 °C, and washed twice with water, and pellets were saved at −80 °C. For the strains AN3-SR2 and AN3-SV2,in vivo labeling was performed as above except cells were grown and labeled in uracil-deficient SD medium to maintain the plasmids, and the [3H]AdoMet was at 72.4 Ci/mmol. Labeled cell extracts were prepared by resuspending each cell pellet in 50 μl of lysis buffer (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotonin). To each mixture, 0.2 g of baked zirconium beads (Biospec Products) were added, and each sample was vortexed 1 min and placed on ice for 1 min. The vortexing and ice incubation was repeated seven times. The lysate was collected, and the beads were washed with 50 μl 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The wash was combined with the lysate and debris was spun down at 16,000 ×g for 5 s. The cleared lysate was used for acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using a Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) against a standard of bovine serum albumin. We were interested in identifying new methyltransferases in the complete genome of the yeast S. cerevisiae based on conserved sequence motifs common to AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. We used motifs I, post-I, II, and III, which we defined previously based on a large number of known methyltransferases (15Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), to search the yeast genome at the site Motifs in Protein Data Bases. 2Available on-line at the following address: http://alces.med.umn.edu/dbmotif.html. The search resulted in 33 candidate genes with identifiable motifs (TableV). Seven of the genes turned out to be known methyltransferases responsible for modifying a variety of substrates including ubiquinone precursors, rRNA, the mRNA cap, an ergosterol precursor, uroporphyrin, and arginine residues on proteins (Tables I and V). We grouped the remaining 26 genes in two categories, “good matches” and “marginal matches” based on the number of conserved regions present in each sequence and on how well the conserved regions, and the intervals between the regions, matched the consensus sequences. We designated these genes as F1 toF26 (Table V). Among the new sequences are four genes (GCD14, NOP1, RAD51, and COX1) which have previously been characterized but have not been associated with methylation. Interestingly, Nop1, a fibrillarin homolog, is known to be important for proper methylation of pre-rRNA (53Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Jansen R. Kern H. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 443-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and it associates with small nucleolar RNAs to allow small nucleolar RNA to properly guide 2′-O-methylation (54Kiss-Laszlo Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Cell. 1996; 85: 1077-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). It is possible that fibrillarin may itself be the rRNA ribose O-methyltransferase. However, its direct role as a methyltransferase has not been demonstrated.

Resting Ca2+ concentrations were higher in HEK-293 cells expressing homotetrameric CCD mutant RyR1 than in cells expressing homotetrameric MH mutant RyR1. Cells expressing homotetrameric CCD or MH mutant RyR1 exhibited lower maximal peak amplitudes of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release than cells expressing wild type RyR1, suggesting that MH and CCD mutants might be “leaky.” In cells expressing homotetrameric wild type or mutant RyR1, the amplitude of 10 mm caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was correlated significantly with the amplitude of carbachol- or thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release, indicating that maximal drug-induced Ca2+ release depends on the size of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store. The content of endogenous sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2b (SERCA2b), measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,45Ca2+ uptake, and confocal microscopy, was increased in HEK-293 cells expressing wild type or mutant RyR1, supporting the view that endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ storage capacity is increased as a compensatory response to an enhanced Ca2+ leak. When heterotetrameric (1:1) combinations of MH/CCD mutant and wild type RyR1 were expressed together with SERCA1 to enhance Ca2+ reuptake, the amplitude of Ca2+release in response to low concentrations of caffeine and halothane was higher than that observed in cells expressing wild type RyR1 and SERCA1. In Ca2+-free medium, MH/CCD mutants were more sensitive to caffeine than wild type RyR1, indicating that caffeine hypersensitivity observed with a variety of MH/CCD mutant RyR1 proteins is not dependent on extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD) mutations were introduced into full-length rabbit Ca2+ release channel (RYR1) cDNA, which was then expressed transiently in HEK-293 cells.

Magee K.R. Brain. 1956; 79: 610-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 2Denborough M.A. Dennett X. Anderson R.M. Br. Med. J. 1973; 1: 272-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Central core disease (CCD) is a rare, non-progressive myopathy, presenting in infancy and characterized by hypotonia and proximal muscle weakness (1Shy G.M. Magee K.R. Brain. 1956; 79: 610-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). An important feature of CCD is its close association with MH susceptibility (2Denborough M.A. Dennett X. Anderson R.M. Br. Med. J. 1973; 1: 272-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although diagnosis of CCD is made on the basis of the lack of oxidative enzymatic activity in central regions of skeletal muscle fibers (3Dubowitz V. Pearse A.G.E. Lancet. 1960; : 23-24Abstract PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the diagnostic test for MH susceptibility in humans is the North American caffeine halothane contracture test (4Larach M.G. Anesth. Analg. 1989; 69: 511-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or its European counterpart, the in vitro contracture test (5Group E.M. Br. J. Anaesth. 1984; 56: 1267-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These tests are based on the hypersensitivity of contracture of muscle strips, obtained by biopsy, to caffeine or halothane. Genetic and biochemical data have supported the view that mutations in the gene encoding the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (RYR1) are a major cause of MH in swine and humans (6MacLennan D.H.

Both MH and CCD mutations are located in two distinct clusters in the linear sequence ofRYR1 lying between residues 35 and 614 (MH domain 1) and between residues 2163 and 2458 (MH domain 2). The fact that MH and CCD mutations are found in the same gene suggests that different genotypic variants might result in a spectrum of phenotypic responses of different severity (7MacLennan D.H. Phillips M.S. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1995; 50: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9MacLennan D.H. Philips M.S. Zhang Y. Schultz S.G. Molecular Biology of Membrane Transport Disorders.

No significant differences were observed in measurements of caffeine and halothane sensitivity between MH and CCD mutants when they were expressed in homozygous state in HEK-293 cells (22Tong J.

It is not clear whether there are differences in resting myoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations in muscle fibers of MH and CCD patients (23Iaizzo P.A. Klein W. Lehmann-Horn F.

Difficulties in obtaining accurate and reproducible measurements of resting Ca2+ concentrations in MH or CCD muscle fibers arise from the possibility that compensation may occur in muscle cells and from the different methods used by different groups who have studied the different mutations. We have attempted to alleviate these problems by transfecting all MH and CCD mutants into HEK-293 cells, which have a homogenous genetic background, and using a fluorescent (Fura-2) imaging assay to measure resting Ca2+ concentrations in these transfected cells. In an earlier study (22Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we showed that 15 MH or CCD (MH/CCD) mutant homotetramers expressed in HEK-293 cells were more sensitive to caffeine and halothane than wild type RyR1. In addition, the response observed for the mutant channels expressed in HEK-293 cells correlated closely with the response observed in contracture tests of muscle samples from humans bearing the same mutations (22Tong J.

In human MH or CCD individuals, however, heterozygosity is most common. In the present study, we have measured resting Ca2+ concentrations in HEK-293 cells expressing the various mutations, analyzed the relationship between caffeine-induced Ca2+ release and intracellular Ca2+ stores, tested for an increase in sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2b (SERCA2b) synthesis as a compensatory factor in cells expressing wild type or mutant RyR1, tested the caffeine sensitivity of heterotetrameric MH or CCD mutants expressed in the presence or absence of SERCA1, and tested the influence of extracellular Ca2+concentration on caffeine responses of MH or CCD mutant channels.

Control cells were treated in the same way, but with no DNA or with expression vector DNA only. Ca2+ photometry and Ca2+ imaging assays were used to measure Ca2+concentration changes in transfected HEK-293 cells as described previously (22Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S.

A Photon Technologies Inc. micro-fluorimetry system was used in photometric assays to measure caffeine-induced changes in Fura-2/AM fluorescence resulting from Ca2+ release through the different ryanodine receptor proteins expressed in HEK-293 cells. Dose-response curves were generated and normalized to the maximal Ca2+ release response observed at 10 mmcaffeine for both the caffeine and the halothane responses. Procedures for Ca2+ imaging were the same as for the Ca2+ photometric assay, except that the cells were loaded with 4 μm Fura-2 AM, 0.02% pluronic F-127 for 45 min and the emitted fluorescence was fed into a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Photon Technologies Inc. SenSys-KAF 1400) instead of a photomultiplier tube. Acquired digital images (400 ms/frame) were analyzed with Image Master 2.0 software (Photon Technologies Inc.). The 340/380 nm ratios from single cells were converted to Ca2+concentrations according to Grynkiewicz et al. (30Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

R min was determined to be 0.4, and the proportionality constant (S f2/S b2) was determined to be 15.2. A value of 224 nm was used for the apparent K dof Ca2+ binding to Fura-2 (30Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Microsomes were prepared and assayed for Ca2+ transport activity, and data were analyzed as described previously (31Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Rice W.J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18359-18364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of 50 μl of the microsome preparation (1 mg/ml) were analyzed by ELISA, as described previously (32Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A primary mouse monoclonal anti-SERCA2 ATPase antibody (IgG2a, Affinity Bioreagents Inc.) was used to detect SERCA2 in microsomes. HEK-293 cells transfected with RYR1 cDNA were cultured on coverslips. They were fixed for 20 min in 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature, washed once with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were then incubated with IgG2a (Affinity Bioreagents Inc.) in 1:100 dilution for 1 h, washed 3 times with PBS, followed by tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody in 1:100 dilution for 1 h, and washed 3 times with PBS. All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides in ImmunoFloure Mounting Medium obtained from ICN. Cells were observed and analyzed with a Nikon Optiphot II microscope, equipped with epifluorescence illumination, and a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal laser scanning microscope system. Immunofluorescent images were recorded on a zip disk and analyzed using NIH Image 5.19 software. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Linear regression analysis was performed using Origin software (Microcal Software Ltd., Northampton, MA). An unpaired Student'st test was used for statistical comparisons of mean values between samples. A value of p < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. In this study, we used Ca2+ photometry and Ca2+ imaging to record the Ca2+ release properties of a number of RyR1 mutants expressed in HEK-293 cells. Ca2+ photometry, which is fast and accurate, provides spatially averaged measurements of the fluorescence used to monitor Ca2+ release. Ca2+imaging provides spatially resolved measurements and was used to acquire images at 2.5 s/frame, permitting us to analyze events in individual cells in response to caffeine. We used Ca2+ imaging to detect caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected withRYR1 cDNA, thereby distinguishing transfected cells from untransfected cells. Ca2+ photometry indicates that Ca2+ release is a rare event in vector-transfected or nontransfected HEK-293 cells which is lost in the background fluorescence when a cluster of 50 or more cells is analyzed. In single cell imaging of pcDNA vector-transfected cells, 6 out of 200 cells responded to 10 mm caffeine, increasing cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations to an average of 180 ± 54 nm (n = 6) and establishing a background response rate of about 3%. In wild type or MH/CCD mutantRYR1-transfected cells, however, 40–60% of isolated cells, where higher DNA transfection was observed, responded to 10 mm caffeine, a rate about 13–20-fold higher than background. Accordingly, caffeine-responsive cells in our Ca2+ imaging studies were regarded asRYR1-transfected cells, and an error rate of 3% was considered to be acceptable. Resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations and 10 mm caffeine-induced Ca2+ release for wild type and 15 MH/CCD mutant RyR1 proteins were measured in singleRYR1-transfected cells. The resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in untransfected HEK-293 cells was 97 ± 5 nm. Transfection with wild type RyR1 raised the resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration to 112 ± 11 nm (Fig. 1 A). The resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in HEK-293 cells transfected with each of the 10 MH mutants tested (C36R, G249R, G342R, R553W, R615C, R615L, R2163C, G2435R, R2458C, and R2458H) also raised the resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration to values ranging from 103 ± 7 to 119 ± 7 nm with an average value of 110 ± 2 nm (Fig. 1 A). There were no significant differences in resting Ca2+concentrations between wild type and any of the MH mutant forms ofRYR1. The resting Ca2+ concentration (Fig.1 A) for each of the 5 CCD mutants tested (R164C, I404M, Y523S, R2163H, and R2436H) was higher than for any of the 10 MH mutants and the average resting Ca2+ concentration for the 5 CCD mutants, 142 ± 9 nm, was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the average resting Ca2+concentration for the 10 MH mutants. However, when resting Ca2+ concentrations for individual CCD mutants were compared with wild type RYR1, significant differences were found for only 2 of the 5 individual CCD mutants tested, Y523S and R2163H (p < 0.05 for Y523S and p < 0.001 for R2163H). Average caffeine-induced Ca2+ release and maximal 340/380 nm ratio change values for MH mutants were 590 ± 107 nm (Fig. 1 B) and 0.36 ± 0.03 (Fig.1 C) (n = 10), respectively, and the comparable values for CCD mutants were 495 ± 60 nm(Fig. 1 B) and 0.28 ± 0.06 (Fig. 1 C) (n = 5). The caffeine-induced Ca2+ release values for MH mutants was not significantly different from the comparable values for CCD mutants. It should be noted, however, that many individual MH and CCD mutants had a significantly lower response to caffeine, measured by both Ca2+ photometry and Ca2+ imaging, than wild type RYR1 (Fig. 1). Maximal 340/380 nm ratio changes were significantly lower for the Y523S (p < 0.001) and R2163H (p < 0.001) mutants (Fig. 1 B), which had higher resting Ca2+concentrations (Fig. 1 A) than wild type RyR1. These results are consistent with the view that CCD mutants might be more leaky than MH mutants, accounting for higher resting Ca2+concentrations and lower Ca2+-releasable stores, and that MH mutants might also be more leaky than wild type, accounting for lower concentrations of Ca2+ in caffeine-releasable stores. To test whether resting Ca2+ concentrations might determine caffeine sensitivity and influence maximal caffeine-induced Ca2+ release, a linear correlation analysis was carried out. Resting Ca2+ concentrations had no linear correlation with caffeine ED50 values (r = −0.31,p = 0.24) or with maximal caffeine-induced Ca2+ release (r = −0.31, p= 0.24). Surprisingly, a linear correlation was observed between ED50 and maximal caffeine-induced Ca2+ release (r = 0.63, p < 0.05) and between ED50 and maximal 340/380 nm ratio change (r= 0.67, p < 0.05, data not shown). A linear correlation analysis was also carried out between maximal caffeine–induced Ca2+ release for 9 MH/CCD mutants obtained in this study and caffeine-induced muscle tension or caffeine threshold obtained through in vitro contracture test in an earlier study (19Manning B.M. Quane K.A. Ording H. Urwyler A. Tegazzin V. Lehane M. O'Halloran J. Hartung E. Giblin L.M. Lynch P.J. Vaughan P. Censier K. Bendixen D. Comi G. Heytens L. Monsieurs K. Fagerlund T. Wolz W. Heffron J.J. Muller C.R. McCarthy T.V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 599-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A linear correlation was observed between maximal caffeine-induced Ca2+ release and caffeine-induced muscle tension (r = −0.83, p < 0.05) and between maximal caffeine-induced Ca2+ release and caffeine threshold (r = 0.83, p < 0.05). To test whether releasable ER Ca2+ stores were really lower in MH/CCD mutant-transfected cells, thapsigargin and carbachol were used to gate Ca2+ release, determined by fluorescence measurement of the amount of Ca2+ released. Thapsigargin increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration by irreversible blocking of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) molecules. Thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release, therefore, represents the rapid, passive depletion of the internal Ca2+ store (33Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Carbachol increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration by activation of the phospholipase C pathway through an endogenous muscarinic receptor found in HEK-293 cells, resulting in elevation of intracellular IP3 and activation of the IP3 receptor (34Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Thus low ER Ca2+ stores would respond with low Ca2+ release following the application of either of these agents. Figs. 2, A–C, shows that there was a close linear correlation for Ca2+ release induced by any of these three reagents in 27 RYR1 cDNA-transfected cells. These cells were challenged sequentially by 10 mm caffeine (RyR1), 20 μm carbachol (IP3 receptor), and 1.5 μm thapsigargin (SERCA). In cells transfected with different MH/CCD mutant cDNAs to form either homotetrameric or heterotetrameric channels, caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was closely correlated with thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 2 D). This close correlation among caffeine-, carbachol-, and thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release indicates that maximal caffeine-induced Ca2+ release reflects the size of the ER Ca2+ store. The lower maximal caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in MH/CCD mutants is likely to be due to a lower Ca2+ store, which, in turn, is likely to reflect Ca2+ leakage through MH/CCD mutant channels. To compare ER Ca2+ stores among untransfected and RYR1 cDNA-transfected cells, carbachol-induced Ca2+ release was measured by Ca2+ imaging and was regarded as an indicator of the size of the Ca2+ store. Fig.3 shows that carbachol-induced Ca2+ release in untransfected HEK-293 cells was smaller than Ca2+ release in cells transfected with wild typeRYR1 but was higher than Ca2+ release in cells transfected with CCD or MH mutant RYR1. The smaller carbachol-induced Ca2+ release in cells transfected with MH/CCD mutants supports the view that these mutants are more leaky than wild type RyR1. The enhancement of the Ca2+ store by transfection of wild type RyR1 led us to test the hypothesis that cells transfected with channels that increase release from ER Ca2+ stores may overexpress endogenous SERCA2b in an attempt to reestablish Ca2+ homeostasis by lowering elevated resting Ca2+ concentrations to normal (Fig. 1). To determine whether cells transfected with wild type or mutant RYR1 had the capacity to create a larger Ca2+ store, SERCA2b contents were measured by ELISA (Fig.4 A), and Ca2+uptake was measured in microsomes extracted from transfected cells (Fig. 4 B). When HEK-293 cells were transfected with wild type RYR1, the SERCA2b content was increased to 119% (ELISA) or 120% (Ca2+ uptake). Transfection with MH mutant R615L led to an increase in SERCA2b content to 117% (ELISA) or 120% (Ca2+ uptake), whereas transfection with CCD mutant Y523S led to an increase in SERCA2b content to 127% (ELISA) or 123% (Ca2+ uptake). Although transfection efficiency approaches 50% for non-confluent cells, overall transfection efficiency is only about 25%. Therefore, the real increase in SERCA2b expression in transfected cells would be about 4-fold higher, approaching a doubling of SERCA2b content. Immunofluorescent labeling and confocal microscopy were used in a third measurement of the enhancement of SERCA2b content in single cells transfected with mutant RyR1. Because only mouse anti-RyR1 and mouse anti-SERCA2 monoclonal antibodies are available, green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector (CLONTECH) and rabbit RyR1 mutant Y523S were cotransfected into HEK-293 cells in a 1:9 molar ratio. GFP fluorescence in cells was regarded as an indicator of transfected cells. Immunofluorescent staining of rabbit RyR1, detected by mouse monoclonal 34C antibody, showed that about 80% of transfected cells expressed both GFP and RyR1, 17% of transfected cells expressed GFP alone and 3% of transfected cells expressed RyR1 alone (not shown). The SERCA2 fluorescence from Y523S-transfected cells, which were GFP-positive, was increased by 74 ± 4% (n = 45, p < 0.001) when compared with fluorescence from untransfected cells (not shown), supporting our other measurements showing that the SERCA2 content of Y523S-transfected cells was nearly doubled. These results suggest that compensation in the form of enhanced SERCA2 expression occurs in RYR1 or MH/CCD mutant cDNA-transfected cells. The maximal caffeine-induced Ca2+ release for most MH/CCD mutant homotetrameric channels was smaller than for wild type channels (Fig. 1). This is in contrast to clinical observations which show that muscle fibers from malignant hyperthermia-sensitive individuals contract more strongly in low concentrations of caffeine and halothane than fibers from normal individuals, in line with enhanced Ca2+ release. Although homotetrameric MH/CCD mutant channels expressed in HEK-293 cells have been shown to be more sensitive to caffeine and halothane than wild type RyR1 (22Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N.

DNA damage triggers a variety of cellular responses in eukaryotic cells, including the induction of a regulatory signaling network that activates checkpoint controls (1Elledge S.J.

Checkpoint activation transiently blocks cell cycle progression by arresting cells in G1 and G2/M and slowing progression through S phase. Genetic studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae andSchizosaccharomyces pombe have identified many of the relevant players in DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation (4Carr A.M. Int. J. Radiat.

A common theme that emerges from these studies is that checkpoint-deficient yeast are dramatically more sensitive to genotoxins than their wild-type counterparts (1Elledge S.J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5525-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting that the checkpoint proteins play critical roles in cellular responses to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that key checkpoint regulators may be conserved between yeast and humans. Cloning of the human gene mutated in AT (ATM) revealed that the ATM gene exhibited significant homology with the S. pombe rad3(sprad3) and S. cerevisiae MEC1(scMEC1) checkpoint genes (6Savitsky K. Bar-Shira A. Gilad S. Rotman G. Ziv Y. Vanagaite L. Tagle D.A. Smith S. Uziel T. Sfez S. et al.Science. 1995; 268: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). The corresponding proteins scMec1, spRad3, and Atm are protein kinases that share large stretches of homology, including a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) 1The abbreviations used are: PIKK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase; IR, ionizing radiation; Gy, gray; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: PIKK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase; IR, ionizing radiation; Gy, gray; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. domain. The PIKKs are also functionally conserved as mutation of scMEC1,sprad3, or ATM disrupts ionizing radiation (IR)-induced checkpoints and sensitizes the organisms to IR (7Zakian V.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 685-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The PIKKs are integral players in a tentative DNA damage-inducible signaling pathway that interfaces with the cell cycle machinery (2Weinert T.

In this model, an unidentified sensor recognizes damaged DNA. Potential sensor candidates include the checkpoint proteins, spRad1, spRad9, spRad17, and spHus1. The sensor relays a signal to PIKK family members, which, at least in the case of ATM, are activated by IR (9Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C.

Despite these advances, the physical and functional roles of these proteins are largely unexplored, even in the well studied yeast systems. To gain insight into the functions of other human checkpoint proteins, we have undertaken a biochemical and cellular analysis of the novel human checkpoint proteins hRad1, hHus1, and hRad9. We show that hRad9 undergoes complex post-translational modifications in undamaged cells and is inducibly phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, suggesting that this protein participates in a DNA damage-inducible signaling pathway. We also demonstrate that fully modified hRad9 interacts selectively with hHus1 and hRad1 in a stable multimolecular complex that is present even in undamaged cells. Thus, these results demonstrate that hRad1, hRad9, and hHus1 form a stable radioresponsive checkpoint complex that actively participates in human cellular responses to DNA damage. K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were transiently transfected by electroporation using a 345-volt, 10-ms pulse delivered with a T 820 electoporator (BTX). All transfections used 40 μg of plasmid DNA, which included, if required, empty vector added to this amount. Cells were cultured for 16–24 h after transfection before use in experiments. Cells were irradiated at a dose rate of 11.4 Gy/min using a 137Cs γ-irradiator. All PCR amplifications were performed with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim). Cloned PCR products were sequenced, and plasmids without mutations were selected for use. The hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 cDNAs were amplified by PCR from a PCR-ready human testes cDNA library (CLONTECH). For hRad9, oligonucleotide primers were used that produced an amino-terminal in-frame fusion with a tandem AU1 epitope tag. The PCR fragment was cloned into pcDNA3 to yield pcDNA3-AU12-hRad9. hRad1 was amplified with PCR primers that appended an amino-terminal tandem FLAG epitope tag fused in-frame with hRad1. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pcDNA3 to yield pcDNA3-FLAG2-hRad1. The hHus1 expression vector was prepared by amplifying hHus1 using primers that added a tandem HA epitope tag to the carboxyl terminus of hHus1. The PCR-derived DNA fragment was cloned into pEF-BOS-ΔRI (19Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) to yield pEF-BOS-ΔRI-hHus1-HA2. Bacterial expression vectors for hexahistidine-tagged hRad1, hHus1, and hRad17 were generated by cloning PCR-amplified DNA fragments into pET24a+ (Novagen, Madison, WI). Histidine-tagged proteins were induced and purified according to manufacturer's instructions. The hRad9 cDNA was cloned into pGEX-KG (20Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal.

Bacterially produced GST-hRad9 was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione agarose. The purified proteins were used to immunize rabbits with standard procedures. The anti-HA and anti-AU1 mAbs were from Babco (Berkeley, CA), and the anti-FLAG mAb was from Eastman Kodak Co. Exponentially growing K562 cells (1 × 107 per sample) were either transfected as indicated above or used directly for immunoprecipitation studies. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 30 mmNa4P207, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, containing freshly added: 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μm microcystin-LR). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated mouse monoclonal antibodies and protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) or rabbit antisera and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel). The gels were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and immunoblotted. All membranes were developed with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Membranes that were sequentially blotted were stripped with two 30-min washes of 8 mguanidine hydrochloride prior to blocking and immunoblotting. K562 cells (1 × 107 per assay point) were treated with the indicated stimuli, and hRad9 was immunoprecipitated. For the phosphatase experiments, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and three times with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm EDTA. Phosphatase-treated samples were incubated with 0.25 unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at 30 °C, with or without 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, following the manufacturer's directions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were then washed once with lysis buffer, mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Comparisons of the predicted human and yeast protein sequences indicate that the human proteins are 25–30% identical and 53–57% similar to their respective homologs, with homologies extending over extensive portions of each protein (12Freire R.

In S. pombe, spRad1 and spHus1 associate in wild-type, but notrad9, mutant yeast. One interpretation of this result is that spRad9 may physically link spRad1 to spHus1, although this hypothesis has not been validated experimentally (18Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To address whether conservation extends to a functional level, we examined the ability of the human homologs to form biochemical complexes similar to those reported in yeast. hHus1 immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 A, upper left panel) contained a 34-kDa protein, which is similar in size to hHus1's predicted mass of 32 kDa. The hHus1 immunoprecipitates also contained an anti-hRad1-reactive 33-kDa band (Fig. 1 A,middle left panel), which comigrated with immunoprecipitated hRad1 (Fig. 1 A, middle right panel), demonstrating that hRad1 associated with hHus1. Immunoblotting of the hHus1 immunoprecipitate with an anti-hRad9 antiserum revealed a 70-kDa band (Fig. 1 A, bottom left panel) that comigrated with immunoprecipitated hRad9 (Fig. 1 A, lower center panel). This was surprising, as hRad9 has a predicted molecular mass of 45 kDa, which is much smaller than the 70-kDa band we observed. However, as we show later, hRad9 undergoes extensive modification (see Figs. 2 and3), which likely accounts for the discrepancy between the apparent and predicted molecular masses.Figure 2Transiently overexpressed hRad9 undergoes complex modifications. K562 cells were transiently transfected with 40 μg of pcDNA3 empty vector only (lanes 1,2, and 4), with 5 μg of pEF-BOS-ΔRI-hHus1-HA2, and 5 μg pcDNA3-FLAG2-hRad1 expression vectors (lane 3), with 20 μg AU1-hRad9 alone (lane 5) or with these amounts of all three checkpoint expression vectors (lane 6). The following day, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either preimmune serum (PI, lane 1), anti-hRad9 (lanes 2 and 3), or anti-AU1 mAb (lanes 4-6). Immunoprecipitations (IP) were immunoblotted with anti-hRad9. The arrows indicate apparent molecular masses of AU1-hRad9 calculated using commercially available protein standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Transiently expressed, epitope-tagged hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 interact. Cells were transfected with 40 μg of pcDNA3 (lanes 1, 5, 9,13), 30 μg of pcDNA3-AU12-hRad9 (lanes 3, 4, 7, 8,11, 12, 15, 16), 5 μg of pEF-BOS-ΔRI-hHus1-HA2 (lanes 2, 4,6, 8, 10, 12,14, 16), or 5 μg of pCDNA3-FLAG2-hRad1 expression vectors. Twenty hours after transfection, the cells were lysed, and an aliquot of each lysate was prepared for electrophoresis (Lysate). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG, anti-HA, or anti-AU1 mAb and lysates, and the precipitates were immunoblotted sequentially with anti-hRad9 (C), anti-FLAG (A), followed by anti-HA (B). The apparent molecular mass of AU1-hRad9 was estimated by comparison with protein standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further verify that these proteins associate, we immunoprecipitated hRad9. In these precipitates we readily observed a hHus1-reactive band (Fig. 1 A, upper center panel) that comigrated with immunoprecipitated hHus1 (Fig. 1 A, upper left panel). We also immunoprecipitated hRad1 and demonstrated that hHus1 (Fig. 1 A, upper right panel) and hRad9 (Fig. 1 A, lower right panel) were present in anti-hRad1 immunoprecipitates. However, we did not find hRad1 in anti-hRad9 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A, middle center panel), even though we did observe hRad9 in anti-hRad1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A, lower right panel). One explanation for these discrepant results is that hRad1 and the immunodominant anti-hRad9 antibodies share an overlapping binding site, which precludes simultaneous interaction. In support of this Fig. 3 demonstrates that anti-epitope immunoprecipitates of AU1-tagged hRad9 contain hRad1. These results suggest that this group of human checkpoint proteins assembles into a multimolecular complex even in the absence of genotoxic stimuli. Epistasis studies identify genetic interactions and are frequently indicative of biochemical interactions as well. Studies in S. cerevisiaehave shown genetic and biochemical interactions among the members of the scRAD24 epistasis group (21Lydall D. Weinert T. Science. 1995; 270: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Longhese M.P. Paciotti V. Fraschini R. Zaccarini R. Plevani P. Lucchini G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which includesS. cerevisiae homologs for HRAD1(scRAD17), HRAD17 (scRAD24), andHRAD9 (partially homologous to scDDC1). Additionally, previous work demonstrated that hRad17 and hRad1 interacted in a two-hybrid system (16Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H.M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18340-18346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, we addressed the possibility that hRad1 and hHus1 might interact with the checkpoint protein hRad17. We immunoprecipitated hHus1 and hRad17 (Fig.1 B, left panel) and hRad1 and hRad17 (Fig.1 B, right panel). The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted first with anti-hHus1 (Fig. 1 B, lower left panel) or anti-hRad1 (Fig. 1 B, lower right panel), followed by anti-hRad17 (Fig. 1 B, upper panels). We found no interactions between hRad17 and hRad1 or hHus1. Thus, these results suggest that the human checkpoint complexes may be differentially assembled in undamaged cells. Alternatively, the interactions may be transient and not detectable under our experimental conditions. To generate a system amenable to further biochemical analysis, we prepared epitope-tagged expression vectors for hRad1, hHus1, and hRad9. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), hRad9 migrated with an apparent molecular mass (70 kDa) that was much larger than predicted (45 kDa), suggesting that the cellular pool of hRad9 may undergo extensive post-translational modifications (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and3). Consistent with this observation, overexpression of AU1-tagged hRad9 revealed multiple species when resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane 5). The major detectable band had an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa. This is significantly smaller than the 70-kDa endogenous hRad9 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3), but still larger than the predicted molecular mass (45 kDa), even when the 2-kDa epitope tag is taken into account. Thus, the major 55-kDa may be either an unmodified form that migrates anomalously or a partially modified version. In addition to the 55-kDa form, multiple slower migrating bands were present above this band, suggesting several steps of post-translational modification (Fig. 2, lane 5). Remarkably, coexpression of hRad9 with hHus1 and hRad1 increased the amount of a highly modified, 72-kDa form of hRad9 (Fig. 2, lane 6). This slow-migrating form of hRad9 had an apparent molecular mass slightly greater than endogenous hRad9, which is due to the addition of the tandem AU1 tag on hRad9. To test whether the epitope-tagged checkpoint proteins recapitulate complex formation, K562 cells were transfected with empty vector, a combination of hHus1 and hRad1, hRad9 alone, or expression vectors for all three proteins. The anti-hRad9 immunoblots of cell lysates (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4) revealed that epitope-tagged hRad9 was highly overexpressed compared with the 70-kDa endogenous hRad9 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and 4), which was not visible on this exposure. Consistent with the results presented in Fig. 2, there were multiple forms of AU1-tagged hRad9, and coexpression of hRad1 and hHus1 enhanced the accumulation of the highly modified form (Fig. 3 C,lane 15 versus lane 16). To assess associations among the transfected proteins, we immunoprecipitated hRad1 (Fig. 3, lanes 5–8) and found epitope-tagged hRad1 (Fig. 3 A), hHus1 (Fig. 3 B), and both endogenous hRad9 (Fig. 3 C, lane 6) and epitope-tagged hRad9 (Fig. 3 C, lane 8) in these immunoprecipitates. We also immunoprecipitated with anti-HA (Fig. 3,lanes 9–12) and looked for associated hRad1 (Fig.3 A), hHus1 (Fig. 3 B), and hRad9 (Fig.3 C). Again, as in the hRad1 (anti-FLAG) immunoprecipitates, endogenous and AU1-tagged hRad9 were present in the complex. Strikingly, in both the hRad1 and hHus1 precipitations, only the most highly modified form of transfected hRad9 associated with these proteins, suggesting that the modification is essential for interaction. In the reciprocal experiment (Fig. 3, lanes 13–16) we observed that hRad1 (Fig. 3 A) and hHus1 (Fig. 3 B) coprecipitated with hRad9. Unlike our observations with the endogenous proteins, hRad1 (Fig. 3 A) was detected readily in the anti-AU1-hRad9 immunoprecipitations, thus suggesting strongly that the rabbit anti-hRad9 antiserum indeed masks or disrupts the hRad1 interaction (see Fig. 1). Taken together, these results revealed that the human checkpoint proteins hRad1 and hHus1 associated selectively with modified hRad9 in a protein assembly that mimics the endogenous complex. scDdc1 is a putative S. cerevisiae homolog of spRad9 and hRad9. Because scDdc1 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage (22Longhese M.P. Paciotti V. Fraschini R. Zaccarini R. Plevani P. Lucchini G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that hRad9 may also be phosphorylated in response to genotoxins. It is important to note that endogenous hRad9 (although highly modified) migrates as a single band when isolated from undamaged cells. However, we noticed that the single endogenous hRad9 band (70-kDa form) exhibited a progressively greater reduction in electrophoretic mobility when isolated from cells irradiated with increasing doses of IR (Fig.4 A). We also explored the time course of the mobility shift, which showed that hRad9 was modified within 30 min, was maximal at 2 h, and persisted for at least 6 h (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether the mobility shift reflected DNA damage-induced phosphorylation, we treated hRad9 immunoprecipitates isolated from irradiated cells with calf intestinal phosphatase (Fig. 4 C). As expected for phosphorylation, the DNA damage-induced mobility shift was readily reversed by treatment with the phosphatase. Moreover, the phosphatase inhibitor β-glycerophosphate blocked the effects of the phosphatase, suggesting that effects of the phosphatase preparation are not the result of contaminating activities. The present results demonstrate that hRad9 undergoes extensive and quantitative modification even in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stimuli. This modification is significant, because it is crucial for hRad9 to interact with the checkpoint proteins hRad1 and hHus1. However, there is an intricate interplay between hRad9 modification and complex formation. Overexpression of hRad1 and hHus1 promote the appearance of fully modified hRad9. One possible explanation for this result is that hRad1 and hHus1 are required for hRad9 modification. Another, perhaps more plausible explanation is that hRad9 is not stable when overexpressed singly, but once modified it associates with hRad1 and hHus1 and forms a stable multimolecular complex. In addition to the modification required for hHus1 and hRad1 interactions, hRad9 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, like its S. cerevisiae homolog scDdc1 (22Longhese M.P. Paciotti V. Fraschini R. Zaccarini R. Plevani P. Lucchini G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of scDdc1 requires the Atm homolog scMec1 (23Paciotti V. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Longhese M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4199-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, in SV40-transformed AT fibroblasts, we observed DNA damage-induced hRad9 phosphorylation (data not shown), suggesting that other PIKKs, possibly Atr, may be key mediators of this signaling pathway. Although we do not yet know the significance of hRad9 phosphorylation, it has no effect on association with hRad1 or hHus1 (data not shown), suggesting that phosphorylation regulates interactions with other members of the checkpoint signaling cascade. There is a precedent for other checkpoint proteins undergoing extensive modifications that dramatically alter their apparent molecular mass and regulate their interactions with other proteins. The unrelated scRad9 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, and this modification is essential for scRad9's interaction with the checkpoint protein kinase scRad53 (24Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). There are several potential molecular modifications that may contribute to hRad9's mobility shift, including phosphorylation that is resistant to phosphatase treatment, possibly due to protection by hHus1 and hRad1 interaction. Although the nature of the hRad9 modification is currently unknown, we are intensively investigating these and other possible molecular alterations of the protein. Previous studies in yeast demonstrated that hRad1 and hHus1 genetically and biochemically interact and are required for activation of checkpoints in response to DNA damage and replication inhibitors (18Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although much genetic evidence attests to their importance in cell cycle arrest and survival, even in the well studied yeast models little is known about their functions. To add further complexity, spRad9, hRad9, spHus1, and hHus1 have no signature sequences or homologies with other proteins that yield clues to their functions. However, spRad1 and hRad1 have significant homology with Ustilago maydis Rec1 exonuclease (12Freire R. Murguia J.R. Tarsounas M. Lowndes N.F. Moens P.B. Jackson S.P.

Additionally, hRad1 may possess 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity (13Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Oostveen I. Yon J. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H.M.L. J. Biol.

The presence of a putative DNA-metabolizing protein in the multimolecular checkpoint complex, coupled with genetic data that place spRad1, spHus1, and spRad9, and their S. cerevisiaecounterparts, early in the response pathway (2Weinert T. Cell. 1998; 94: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 3Longhese M.P. Foiani M. Muzi-Falconi M. Lucchini G. Plevani P.

Science. 1995; 270: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), suggests that the complex may function as a sensor that scans the genome for damaged DNA. Once damaged DNA is detected, this complex may initiate endonucleolytic processing of the lesions and trigger interactions with downstream signaling elements. Alternatively, the checkpoint complex may link unknown damage recognition components to downstream signal-transducing pathways that include ATM and hChk1, both of which are implicated in actively enforcing cell cycle arrest after DNA damage. Thus, the present data provide the first identification of a DNA damage-responsive human checkpoint complex that is fundamentally conserved between yeast and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2150446853,"A growing body of evidence indicates that regulation of protein-serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A) involves its association with other cellular and viral proteins in multiprotein complexes. PP2A-containing protein complexes may exist that contribute to PP2A's important regulatory role in many cellular processes. To identify such protein complexes, PP2A was partially purified from rat brain soluble extracts following treatment with a reversible cross-linker to stabilize large molecular size forms of PP2A. Compared with native (uncross-linked) PP2A, cross-linked PP2A revealed an enrichment of p70 S6 kinase and two p21-activated kinases (PAK1 and PAK3) in the PP2A complex, indicating these kinases may associate with PP2A. The existence of protein kinase-PP2A complexes in rat brain soluble extracts was further substantiated by the following results: 1) independent immunoprecipitation of the kinases revealed that PP2A co-precipitated with p70 S6 kinase and the two PAK isoforms; 2) glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase fusion proteins of p70 S6 kinase and PAK3 each isolated PP2A; and 3) PAK3 and p70 S6 kinase bound to microcystin-Sepharose (an affinity resin for PP2A-PP1). Cumulatively, these findings provide evidence for association of PP2A with p70 S6 kinase, PAK1, and PAK3 in the context of the cellular environment. Moreover, together with the recent reports describing associations of PP2A with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (Westphal, R. S., Anderson, K. A., Means, A. R., and Wadzinski, B. E. (1998) <i>Science</i> 280, 1258–1261) and casein kinase IIα (Heriche, J. K., Lebrin, F., Rabilloud, T., Leroy, D., Chambaz, E. M., and Goldberg, Y. (1997)<i>Science</i> 276, 952–955), the present data provide compelling evidence for the existence of protein kinase-PP2A signaling modules as a new paradigm for the control of various intracellular signaling cascades."

Recent evidence suggests that GABA transporter function can be regulated, although the initial triggers for such regulation are not known. One hypothesis is that transporter function is modulated by extracellular GABA concentration, thus providing a feedback mechanism for the control of neurotransmitter levels at the synapse. To test this hypothesis, GABA uptake assays were performed on primary dissociated rat hippocampal cultures that endogenously express GABA transporters and on mammalian cells stably expressing the cloned rat brain GABA transporter GAT1. In both experimental systems, extracellular GABA induces chronic changes in GABA transport that occur in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. In addition to GABA, ACHC and nipecotic acid, both substrates of GAT1, up-regulate transport; GAT1 transport inhibitors that are not transporter substrates down-regulate transport. These changes occur in the presence of blockers of both GABAA and GABAB receptors, occur in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, and are not influenced by intracellular GABA. Surface biotinylation experiments reveal that the increase in transport is correlated with an increase in surface transporter expression. This increase in surface expression is due, at least in part, to a slowing of GAT1 internalization in the presence of extracellular GABA. These data suggest that the GABA transporter fine-tunes its function in response to extracellular GABA and would act to maintain a constant level of neurotransmitter at the synaptic cleft. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporters on neurons and glia at or near the synapse function to remove GABA from the synaptic cleft.

Iversen L.L. Iversen S.D. Snyder S.H. Handbook of Psychopharmacology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1975: 381-442Google Scholar). Demonstration of a physiological role for GABA transporters comes from experiments involving specific GABA uptake inhibitors; these inhibitors prolong the decay phase of GABAA receptor-mediated post-synaptic potentials (2Isaacson J.S. Solis J.M. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and both prolong the decay phase and increase the magnitude of responses mediated by the G protein-coupled GABAB receptor (2Isaacson J.S.

GABA transporters also play a physiological role in toad and catfish horizontal cells where calcium-independent GABA efflux through the transporter is a principal mode of neurotransmitter release (5Schwartz E.A. Science. 1987; 238: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). GABA transporters also have a pathophysiological role. There is decreased calcium-independent GABA release in the affected hippocampus of temporal lobe epileptics. This decrease in transporter-mediated efflux is correlated with fewer GABA transporters and is hypothesized to result in decreased inhibitory tone (6During M.J. Ryder K.M. Spencer D.D. Nature. 1995; 376: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Not only can GABA transporters regulate neuronal signaling, transport itself can be regulated. This is true for GABA transporters and other members of this family as well (for review see Refs. 7Gegelashvili G. Schousboe A. Mol.

Functional modulation occurs through a variety of second messengers such as kinases, phosphatases, arachidonic acid, and pH. These factors may act directly on the transporter protein (e.g. by phosphorylation; see Refs. 9Casado M. Bendahan A. Zafra F. Danbolt N.C. Arag-n C. Giménez C. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

A recurring theme is that the regulation occurs through changes in the number of functional surface transporters (14Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J.

In rat basophilic leukemia cells, the maximum velocity of serotonin transport is increased upon adenosine receptor activation (17Miller K.J. Hoffman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27351-27356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serotonin transport is increased in platelets following stimulation of histamine receptors (18Launay J.M. Bondoux D. Oset-Gasque M.J. Emami S. Mutel V. Haimart M. Gespach C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R526-R536PubMed Google Scholar). Increases in glutamate transport in primary astrocyte cultures are prevented by antagonists of αamino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid/kainate receptors (19Gegelashvili G. Civenni G. Racagni G. Danbolt N.C. Schousboe I. Schousboe A. Neuroreport. 1996; 8: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); this result is consistent with the hypothesis that extracellular transmitter levels, signaled by receptor activation, feed back to up-regulate transporter function. Several investigations have shown regulation of transporters following interactions of the transporter with transporter antagonists. Heterologously expressed norepinephrine transporters are down-regulated following long term (>3 days) treatment with the norepinephrine transporter antagonist desipramine, perhaps through changes in protein expression and/or transporter turnover (20Zhu M.Y. Blakely R.D. Apparsundaram S. Ordway G.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1547-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For GABA transporters, chronic treatment with the GAT1-specific transporter inhibitor tiagabine down-regulates GABA transporter expression in brain tissue (21Thomsen C. Suzdak P.D. Epilepsy Res. 1995; 21: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), although whether this is due to inhibition of the transporter directly or to spillover of GABA onto GABA receptors, and subsequent receptor-mediated signaling effects, is not known. In the present report, we show that both agonists and antagonists of the GABA transporter can trigger long term changes in GABA transporter function, and we identify the mechanism underlying these changes. This effect occurs in several different cell systems including hippocampal cells that endogenously express the transporter. We show that transporter expression increases with extracellular GABA concentration and occurs on a time scale of minutes, consistent with the idea that transporter function might be regulated in order to maintain constant neurotransmitter levels at the synapse. Furthermore, we show that the modulation occurs through the action of GABA on the transporter directly (i.e. it is not mediated by GABA receptors) and that the regulation of transporter expression levels is due to a net change in the rate of transporter internalization. Primary hippocampal cultures were prepared from postnatal day 0–3 rats by mincing tissue in α-MEM supplemented with cysteine, glucose, and 100 units of papain (Sigma or Worthington). Tissue was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C followed by gentle trituration, dilution, and plating onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. To obtain pure neuronal cultures, mixed cultures were treated for 48 h with 10 μm cytosine arabinoside (Sigma); treatment was initiated 24 h after plating. Astrocyte cultures were prepared as described (22Ye Z.-C. Sontheimer H. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2181-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto untreated 24-well plates and maintained in Earle's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 1F9 cells (CHO cells stably expressing GAT1; see Ref. 23Corey J.L. Guastella J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were maintained in α-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum,l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.). The lipid/DNA mixture was incubated with the cells for 5 h; cells were then rinsed and re-fed with complete media. Stable transformants were obtained by selection in 500 ng/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Pre-assay drug incubations were performed in HBSS. Preincubation solutions were continually perfused to maintain constant extracellular drug concentrations. Following preincubation, cells were rinsed three times in 1× HBSS and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min in the final wash. Buffer was then exchanged with control HBSS or drug-containing HBSS. GABA was added to initiate the assay. The final [3H]GABA concentration of the assay solution was 100 nm; the total GABA concentration of the assay solution was 30 μm. In order to minimize changes in transporter expression during the assay, assay times were 5 min. The assay was terminated by rapidly rinsing the cells 3 times with 1× HBSS, followed by solubilization in 300 μl of 0.001–0.005% SDS at 37 °C for 2 h. Aliquots were used for scintillation counting and to determine protein concentrations. Statistical analyses of the uptake data were performed using SPSS. Two-sample comparisons were made using t tests; multiple comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variances followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc test. Biotinylation experiments were performed essentially as described (14Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 60-mm tissue culture dishes to 80% confluence. The cells were rinsed twice with 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline/Ca2+/Mg2+ (in mm: 138 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 1.5 KH2PO4, 9.6 Na2HPO4, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cells were next incubated with 2 ml of a solution containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline/Ca2+/Mg2+ for 20 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The biotinylation solution was removed by two washes in phosphate-buffered saline/Ca2+/Mg2+ plus 100 mmglycine and quenched in this solution by incubating the cells at 4 °C for 45 min with gentle shaking. The cells were lysed with 1 ml of RIPA buffer (in mm: 100 Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 250 μmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 60 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. The supernatant fractions (300 ml) were incubated with an equal volume of Immunopure Immobilized Monomeric Avidin beads (Pierce) at room temperature for 60 min. The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and adsorbed proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for 30 min. Analysis was performed on aliquots 1) taken prior to incubation with beads (total cell lysate), 2) of the supernatant fraction after adsorption and centrifugation (intracellular fraction), and 3) of the bead eluate (biotinylated fraction). Western blotting was carried out using anti-GAT1 antibody 346J (13Beckman M.L. Bernstein E. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described (24Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and visualized using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Monoclonal anti-actin antibodies (Sigma) were used to normalize protein levels in each fraction. Immunoreactive bands were scanned and quantitated with ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). To examine the effect of extracellular GABA on chronic changes in GABA uptake, primary neuronal cultures from neonatal rat hippocampus were preincubated in 100 μm GABA for 1 h prior to assay. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig.1 A. Compared with control cultures not incubated in GABA, treatment of these cultures with extracellular GABA resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in GABA uptake measured in subsequent transport assays. This increase in transport did not occur in experiments in which extracellular GABA was replaced by glutamate or by glycine (data not shown). These data suggest that the modulation of uptake is due to a GABA-mediated process. The inclusion of SKF89976A, a high affinity inhibitor (25Larsson O.M. Falch E. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Schousboe A. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) of the rat brain GABA transporter GAT1 (26Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), during the assay reduced GABA uptake by greater than 90% both in control cultures and cultures pretreated with GABA. These data suggest that the majority of GABA transport mediated in these neuronal cultures, and the subsequent modulation by GABA, occurs via GAT1. However, the effect is not specific to GAT1 expressed in neuronal cultures. Fig. 1 Bshows that a similar modulation in GABA uptake following extracellular GABA treatment occurs in primary rat hippocampal astrocyte cultures. Treatments with SKF89976A reveal that the effects on astrocyte cultures are mediated primarily by GAT1 as well. To eliminate the possibility that the increase in GABA transport following GABA preincubation might simply be due to an increase in the velocity of transport (because of higher GABA concentrations inside the pretreated cells), we performed the assays using 30 μm GABA, a concentration that is saturating for GAT1-mediated transport. Fig. 1, C and D, shows that the increase in transport following extracellular GABA treatment is both concentration-dependent and time-dependent. A logistic fit to the concentration-response data estimates an EC50 for up-regulation by GABA to be approximately 5 μm, which is comparable to the K mvalues for GABA uptake in both brain tissue (27Martin D.L. Roberts E. Chase T.N. Tower D.B. GABA in Nervous System Function. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1976: 347-387Google Scholar, 28Lewin L. Mattsson M.-O. Rassin D.K. Sellstrom A. Neurochem. Res. 1992; 17: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and in cells heterologously expressing GAT1 (23Corey J.L. Guastella J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 29Keynan S. Suh Y.-J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Additionally, maximal up-regulation of uptake occurred with 30 min of pretreatment with 100 μm GABA. Twelve-hour treatment with extracellular GABA resulted in no further increases in uptake than that seen at 30 min (data not shown). The evidence that the EC50 of GABA necessary for up-regulation is comparable to the K m of the transporter for GABA suggested the hypothesis that the up-regulation was closely related to a transporter-mediated process. To add support to this hypothesis, experiments were performed (i) using other substrates and an antagonist of the transporter, and (ii) inhibitors of GABA receptors. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig.2. Fig. 2 A shows concentration-response curves for neuronal cultures treated with two GABA transport substrates, nipecotic acid and ACHC, and the GAT1 antagonist SKF89976A. Pretreatment of neurons for 1 h prior to assay with either nipecotic acid or ACHC resulted in an up-regulation in GABA transport, with estimates of EC50 values for up-regulation of approximately 9 and 72 μm, respectively. SKF89976A caused a down-regulation of transport, similar to that previously reported for the GAT1 antagonist tiagabine (21Thomsen C. Suzdak P.D. Epilepsy Res. 1995; 21: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with an EC50 for down-regulation of approximately 1 μm. To rule out the possibility that the decrease in transport seen following incubation with SKF89976A was due to acute inhibition of uptake during the assay (i.e. to rule out the possibility that SKF89976A was not washed off prior to assay), transport in untreated cells was compared with cells that were treated with SKF89976A for 5 min and then rinsed and assayed. No difference between these two groups was seen (data not shown). These results provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that the transport regulation is a transporter-mediated process. Namely, EC50values for both up-regulation and down-regulation for each compound tested are comparable to the K m values for transport estimated for these compounds in previous GABA transporter investigations (30Bowery N.G. Jones J.P. Neal M.J. Nature. 1976; 264: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Yunger L.M. Fowler P.J. Zarevics P. Setler P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984; 228: 109-115PubMed Google Scholar). Because nipecotic acid, ACHC, and SKF89976A prevent the uptake of GABA competitively, it was possible that some of the transport regulation was due to GABA receptor-mediated action from neuronally released GABA. To test this hypothesis, GABA-mediated up-regulation was examined in the presence of bicuculline and phaclofen, inhibitors of GABAA and GABAB receptors, respectively. These results are shown in Fig. 2 B. Pretreatment of cultures with these drugs, at concentrations that are routinely used to eliminate receptor-mediated responses in hippocampal cells, failed to inhibit the up-regulation. In addition, pretreatment of cultures with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, failed to alter the GABA-mediated up-regulation; these latter results are not surprising given the 30-min time course over which transport is altered (see Fig.1 D). Given the data from hippocampal neurons suggesting that regulation of transport is mediated through GAT1, an expression system was sought that would mimic the endogenous phenomenology and that would permit a detailed characterization of the mechanisms underlying the regulation. Therefore, the experiments were repeated in 1F9 cells, a mammalian cell line stably expressing GAT1. The results of such experiments are shown in Fig. 3. As in neuronal cultures, pretreatment of 1F9 cells with 100 μm extracellular GABA resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in subsequent GABA uptake. The other two transporter substrates, nipecotic acid and ACHC, similarly increased transport. The GAT1 antagonist SKF89976A, incubated alone or with submaximal concentrations of transporter substrates, reduced subsequent GABA transport. Similar results were obtained using a PC12 cell line stably expressing GAT1 (data not shown). These data demonstrate that GAT1 regulation occurs similarly in cells that endogenously express the transporter and in heterologous expression systems and support the idea that the regulation is a transporter-mediated effect. Given that there is unlikely to be extracellular GABA in these cultures in the absence of that exogenously applied, these data strongly suggest that the change in transport is not due to spillover of GABA onto GABA receptors. Chronic changes in uptake induced by transporter-interacting compounds could be produced, in general, either by altering the turnover rate of individual transporters or by altering the number of functional transporters. By analogy with receptor binding experiments, data obtained from saturation experiments are often used to distinguish between these two possibilities as follows: changes in the maximum velocity of transport (V max) are indicative of changes in the number of transporter-binding sites, and changes in affinity (K m) are indicative of changes in the function of individual transporters. Saturation analysis was performed on 1F9 cells preincubated in control solution or solution containing GABA or SKF89976A. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig.4A. Eadie-Hofstee transformations (not shown) of the saturation data revealed V maxvalues of 424 pmol/min/mg of protein (untreated cells), 302 pmol/min/mg of protein (SKF89976A-treated cells), and 842 pmol/min/mg of protein (GABA-treated cells). K m values, which were not significantly affected by the treatments were 5.3, 5.9, and 5.4 μm for untreated, SKF89976A-treated, and GABA-treated cells, respectively. These alterations in V maxare consistent with changes in the number of functional transporters. To test this hypothesis directly, GAT1 immunoreactivity following biotinylation of surface proteins was examined in 1F9 cells preincubated with either GABA or SKF89976A. These data are shown in Fig. 4 B. As shown both in the representative immunoblot and in the graph of densitometry measurements, preincubation of cells with GABA caused an increase in the amount of GAT1 immunoreactivity in the biotinylated fraction, the fraction corresponding to the surface population of transporters. This increase in surface immunoreactivity was correlated with a decrease in intracellular GAT1 immunoreactivity. Pretreatment of cells with SKF89976A resulted in a decrease in surface GAT1 immunoreactivity and a corresponding increase in intracellular GAT1 labeling. Two control experiments support these findings. First, the intracellular cytoskeletal protein actin was not labeled by the biotinylation reagent, suggesting that only surface proteins were being labeled; and second, immunoreactive bands were not seen in untransfected CHO cells immunoblotted with the GAT1 antibody (data not shown). The immunoblot data correlate well with the functional changes in uptake suggesting that compounds that interact with the transporter act to alter the number of cell-surface transporters. Furthermore, the evidence that the amount of transporter immunoreactivity in total cell lysates was unchanged by GABA or SKF89976A treatment supports the data showing regulation of the transporter in the presence of cycloheximide (see Fig. 2 B) and suggests that the modulation is due to a redistribution of transporters rather than due to synthesis of new transporter protein. The data obtained in the presence of GABA receptor blockers and the results from experiments using substrates of the transporter that do not activate GABA receptors strongly suggest that the mechanism of transporter regulation is not through a GABA receptor-mediated process. Another possibility is that the amount of GABA (or related compounds) present intracellularly regulates transporter redistribution. This hypothesis is consistent with up-regulation of GABA transport by transporter substrates and down-regulation of GABA transporters in the presence of SKF89976A. To test this hypothesis, 1F9 cells were transfected with another GABA transporter, GAT3, and experiments were performed in the presence of extracellular GABA and SKF89976A. If regulation is due to the amount of intracellular GABA, then GABA uptake by GAT3 in the presence of SKF89976A (which blocks GAT1 with approximately 200-fold higher affinity than GAT3) should increase GAT1 expression. On the other hand, if the regulation signal is a GAT1-mediated process directly, then the presence of SKF89976A should result in a down-regulation of GAT1 expression (as shown in Fig.4 B). The result of this experiment is shown in Fig.5. The concentration of SKF89976A was chosen such that the majority of GAT1 would be inhibited, whereas GAT3 inhibition would be minimal. Cells expressing both GAT1 and GAT3 show less inhibition by SKF89976A than cells expressing GAT1 alone when SKF89976A is included in the assay. This decrease in inhibition of uptake is consistent with GABA transport occurring through GAT3. Biotinylation experiments (see immunoblot) revealed that surface GAT1 expression was reduced following preincubation with SKF89976A. Since intracellular GABA should have been accumulating (via GAT3) during this time, intracellular GABA levels do not appear to determine the regulation of the transporter. Rather, the down-regulation of the transporter in the presence of SKF89976A in these cells is consistent with an interaction of compounds with the transporter directly. It is interesting to note that preincubation of GAT1/GAT3-expressing cells with both GABA and SKF89976A caused a slight increase in transport compared with untreated cells. Since surface GAT1 expression was reduced by this treatment, such an increase is likely due to an increase in GAT3 expression. The redistribution of GAT1 from intracellular locations to the plasma membrane in the presence of extracellular GABA suggested that the modulation might be occurring by changes in the rates of transporter turnover. To test this hypothesis, 1F9 cells were preincubated for 1 h with a control solution or a solution containing 100 μm GABA, surface-biotinylated, and then processed at various time points after biotinylation. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 6 A. Control cultures showed an approximately 50% decrease in surface GAT1 immunoreactivity (GAT1 immunoreactivity of the biotinylated fraction) over the 2-h experiment. In contrast, the decrease in surface GAT1 immunoreactivity was significantly slowed in GABA-treated cultures. Greater than 80% of the immunoreactivity remained at 2 h. Although these data strongly support the idea that the interaction of the transporter with substrates slows the internalization of the transporter, these data do not rule out the possibility that there is also an increase in the rate of transporter insertion into the membrane as well. To determine whether a similar mechanism occurs with the endogenous GABA transporter, these time course biotinylation experiments were repeated in hippocampal neurons. Cultures were preincubated for 1 h with a control solution or a solution containing 100 μmGABA, surface-biotinylated, and then processed at various time points after biotinylation. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig.6 B. Once again, the evidence suggests that the interaction of the transporter with substrates slows transporter internalization. Neurotransmitter transporters exhibit a number of functional properties that enable them to influence extracellular neurotransmitter levels. For example, unitary transport rates are dependent on substrate concentrations, with half-maximal effective concentrations for transport occurring in the sub-micromolar to low micromolar range (1Iversen L.L. Iversen L.L. Iversen S.D. Snyder S.H. Handbook of Psychopharmacology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1975: 381-442Google Scholar,32Rudnick G. Clark J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Additionally, transporters operate in reverse and non-vesicular efflux of transmitter will contribute to ambient extracellular transmitter levels. Transmitter efflux through the transporter may be related to pathophysiological conditions (6During M.J. Ryder K.M. Spencer D.D. Nature. 1995; 376: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 33Attwell D. Barbour B. Szatkowski M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16561-16568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) but is also a principal mode of neurotransmitter release in some systems (5Schwartz E.A. Science. 1987; 238: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Neurotransmitter transporter expression can be regulated, and such changes in the number of functional transporters will also contribute to the control of synaptic neurotransmitter levels. In the present report, we show that GABA transporter substrates and antagonists can interact with the GABA transporter to regulate directly transmitter uptake through alterations in surface transporter expression. These data strongly suggest a feedback mechanism in which transporters use extracellular neurotransmitter levels as a signal for the dynamic control of neurotransmitter levels at the synapse. GABA transporter function is modulated by protein kinase C both in cells that endogenously express the transporter (13Beckman M.L. Bernstein E. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gomeza J. Casado M. Gimenez C. Aragon C. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and in heterologous expression systems (24Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sato K. Betz H. Schloss P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37Osawa I. Saito N. Koga T. Tanaka C. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 19: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The results from a majority of these studies show changes in the maximum velocity of transport, consistent with the hypothesis that transporter expression levels are altered. More direct measures, including subcellular fractionation (24Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and estimating functional GABA transporter number by transporter-specific charge movements (15Quick M.W. Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), support this hypothesis. One mechanism by which protein kinase C mediates its effect on GAT1 is by regulating the interaction of GAT1 with components of the docking and fusion apparatus (13Beckman M.L. Bernstein E. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The evidence that GABA-mediated decreases in GAT1 function also result in a change in surface GAT1 molecules raises the possibility that such SNARE proteins are also involved in this form of GAT1 internalization. SNARE proteins have been implicated in the internalization and externalization of the type 4 glucose transporters (for review, see Ref. 38Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There appear to be multiple mechanisms even by which transporter substrates and/or antagonists can influence transporter function and expression. mRNA levels in brain for serotonin (39Neumaier J.F. Root D.C. Hamblin M.W. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1996; 15: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 40Rattray M. Wotherspoon G. Savery D. Baldessari S. Marden C. Priestley J.V. Bendotti C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 268: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and dopamine (41Xia Y. Goebel D.J. Kapatos G. Bannon M.J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) transporters are reduced following long term (>24 h) transporter antagonist treatments or by removal of substrate (42Yu A. Yang J. Pawlyk A.C. Tejani-Butt S.M. Brain Res. 1995; 688: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although whether this significantly alters transporter protein levels (42Yu A. Yang J. Pawlyk A.C. Tejani-Butt S.M. Brain Res. 1995; 688: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) is unclear. In the present experiments it is unlikely that changes in mRNA or protein levels are mediating the regulation because (i) the time course of the modulation is on the order of minutes, (ii) it occurs in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, and (iii) GAT1 protein levels, although redistributed, appear to be unchanged. The triggers for these effects on mRNA levels are unclear sincein vivo blockade of transporters likely causes increased receptor-mediated signaling as well. Mammalian cells expressing norepinephrine transporters also show reduced uptake following 3-day transporter antagonist incubation, and this occurs in the absence of changes to mRNA levels (20Zhu M.Y. Blakely R.D. Apparsundaram S. Ordway G.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1547-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whether this net internalization of norepinephrine transporters occurs by a mechanism similar to that of GAT1 in unknown; the much slower time course suggests that this could be a different form of transporter regulation. Experiments are under way to examine changes in GAT1 mRNA and protein levels following long term (>3 day) substrate and antagonist treatments. We are also examining whether other neurotransmitter transporters are regulated in a manner similar to GAT1. Although there have not been other reports of transporter regulation by extracellular neurotransmitter levels on the time scale of minutes, such changes may be easily overlooked because the time course of the regulation occurs on a time scale comparable to that typically used to assay uptake (i.e. 15–60 min). Thus, assays used to assess control levels of uptake will be confounded by concomitant changes in transporter expression. There are two well characterized systems in which agonist-induced and antagonist-induced signals produce changes in rates of internalization. These are nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (43Berg D.K. Hall Z.W. Science. 1974; 184: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and G protein-coupled receptors (for review, see Ref. 44Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although the phenomenology of these processes is well described, the mechanisms underlying the down-regulation in surface expression are not well understood. How rates of transporter internalization are altered by substrate interaction is not known, although the opposite effects that occur in the presence of antagonists raise the possibility that the internalization signal is influenced by transporter conformation. One possibility is that the process of substrate transport alters the interaction of GABA transporter with SNARE proteins (e.g.syntaxins) that act to sequester the transporter in a non-functional state (13Beckman M.L. Bernstein E. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus shifting the balance of surface and internalized transporter pools."
https://openalex.org/W1874909451,"A novel member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family has been identified from the human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library, named vascular endothelial growth inhibitor (VEGI). The VEGI gene was mapped to human chromosome 9q32. The cDNA for VEGI encodes a protein of 174 amino acid residues with the characteristics of a type II transmembrane protein. Its amino acid sequence is 20-30% identical to other members of the TNF family. Unlike other members of the TNF family, VEGI is expressed predominantly in endothelial cells. Local production of a secreted form of VEGI via gene transfer caused complete suppression of the growth of MC-38 murine colon cancers in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. Histological examination showed marked reduction of vascularization in MC-38 tumors that expressed soluble but not membrane-bound VEGI or were transfected with control vector. The conditioned media from soluble VEGI-expressing cells showed marked inhibitory effect on in vitro proliferation of adult bovine aortic endothelial cells. Our data suggest that VEGI is a novel angiogenesis inhibitor of the TNF family and functions in part by directly inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation. The results further suggest that VEGI maybe highly valuable toward angiogenesis-based cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1971873200,"Escherichia coli possesses a flavohemoglobin (Hmp), product of hmp, the first microbial globin gene to be sequenced and characterized at the molecular level. Although related proteins occur in numerous prokaryotes and eukaryotic microorganisms, the function(s) of these proteins have been elusive. Here we report construction of a defined hmp mutation and its use to probe Hmp function. As anticipated from up-regulation ofhmp expression by nitric oxide (NO),S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP), the hmp mutant is hypersensitive to these agents. Thehmp promoter is more sensitive to SNP andS-nitroso-N-penicillamine (SNAP) than is thesoxS promoter, consistent with the role of Hmp in protection from reactive nitrogen species. Additional functions for Hmp are indicated by (a) parallel sensitivity of thehmp mutant to the redox-cycling agent, paraquat, (b) inability of the mutant to up-regulate fully thesoxS and sodA promoters in response to oxidative stress caused by paraquat, GSNO and SNP, and (c) failure of the mutant to accumulate reduced paraquat radical after anoxic growth. We conclude that Hmp plays a role in protection from nitrosating agents and NO-related species and oxidative stress. This protective role probably involves direct detoxification of those species and sensing of NO-related and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W1750623197,"It is not well appreciated that nutritional status can modulate apoptosis, a process that eliminates unwanted or damaged cells. Choline is an essential nutrient, and its absence induces apoptosis. When PC12 cells were cultivated in a choline-free medium, apoptosis was induced (27.4% of cells apoptotic at 72 h as compared to 4.4% in control medium). In choline-free medium at 72 h, there was a 49% decrease in phosphatidylcholine concentration (P<0.01) and a 34% decrease in sphingomyelin concentration (P<0.01); however, there was no change in phosphatidylethanolamine concentration. Before detecting increased apoptosis in choline-deficient cells, we measured a significant increase in ceramide (218% control) and diacyglycerol (155% control) concentrations. The addition of a cell-permeable ceramide to cells in control medium induced apoptosis; however, adding a cell-permeable diacyglycerol did not induce apoptosis. Caspase is a common mediator of apoptosis, and choline deficiency-induced apoptosis was prevented completely by replacing choline or adding a caspase inhibitor into the medium within 48 h of initial choline deprivation. In those cells rescued by replacing choline at 36 h, the concentrations of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, ceramide, and diacyglycerol returned to levels of control cells. In those cells rescued by adding a caspase inhibitor at 36 h, the concentrations of sphingomyelin and ceramide returned to control levels, but the concentrations of phosphatidylcholine and diacyglycerol did not return to normal. We propose that availability of dietary factors (choline in this model) can modulate apoptosis. Mechanisms that we identify using this model may help us to explain why dietary choline influences brain development.—Yen, C.-L. E., Mar, M.-H., Zeisel, S. H. Choline deficiency-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells is associated with diminished membrane phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, accumulation of ceramide and diacylglycerol, and activation of a caspase.

We report that Stat5 interacts constitutively with the IFN receptor-associated Tyk-2 kinase, and during IFNα stimulation its tyrosine-phosphorylated form acts as a docking site for the SH2 domain of CrkL. CrkL and Stat5 then form a complex that translocates to the nucleus. This IFN-inducible CrkL-Stat5 complex binds in vitro to the TTCTAGGAA palindromic element found in the promoters of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes.

Following engagement of the Type I IFN receptor by IFNα or IFNβ, two kinases of the Janus family, Tyk-2 and Jak-1, are activated and phosphorylate the Stat proteins: Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, and Stat5 (3Darnell Jr., J.E.

Activated Stat proteins form distinct signaling complexes to regulate gene transcription. Stat1 and Stat2 form a heterodimer that associates with a member of the IFN regulatory factor family, p48, resulting in the formation of the mature ISGF3 complex that translocates to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription by binding to interferon-stimulated response elements (3Darnell Jr., J.E.

These include the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) pathway that regulates activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (6Uddin S. Yenush L. Sun X-J. Sweet M.E. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

In the present study we determined whether the CrkL pathway functions in coordination with the Stat pathway. Our data demonstrate that Stat5 is constitutively associated with the Tyk-2 kinase, and its IFN-phosphorylated form provides a docking site for the SH2 domain of CrkL. The resulting CrkL-Stat5 complex translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription via GAS elements. Viewed together, these findings provide evidence for a novel function of CrkL as a nuclear adapter protein. The Daudi and KG1 human cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics. Human recombinant IFNα2 was provided by Hoffmann-La Roche. Human recombinant IFNα-consensus (IFNCon1) was provided by Amgen Inc. Human recombinant IFNβ was provided by Biogen Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The anti-CrkL and anti-Stat5b polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The production of the pGEX-CrkLSH2 construct has been described previously (10Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with 104 units/ml of the indicated interferons as described previously (9Ahmad S. Alsayed Y. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29991-29994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After stimulation, the cells were lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting using the ECL method were performed as described previously (9Ahmad S. Alsayed Y.

Production of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and binding experiments using lysates from IFNα-untreated or -treated cells were performed as described previously (9Ahmad S. Alsayed Y.

Preparation of nuclear extracts, genomic DNA affinity chromatography, and mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described previously (12Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide specific for Stat5 binding (AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAAATC), derived from the β-casein promoter, was synthesized and used in gel shift assays. We sought to identify the tyrosine kinase that regulates IFNα-induced activation of Stat5 and the mechanisms by which the protein is activated and binds DNA. When lysates from IFNα-stimulated KG1 myeloid cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Tyk-2 antibody and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine, we noted that a tyrosyl phosphoprotein migrating as a doublet at 96/94 kDa was complexed with Tyk-2 (Fig. 1 A). This protein corresponded to Stat5, as determined by immunoblotting with a specific anti-Stat5 antibody (Fig. 1 B). The interaction of Stat5 with Tyk-2 was present prior to IFNα treatment and increased further after IFNα stimulation, suggesting that Stat5 interacts constitutively with Tyk-2 and thus may provide a link between this kinase and downstream signaling elements. Similarly, a constitutive interaction of Stat5 with Tyk-2 was seen in studies with the IFNα-sensitive Daudi lymphoblastoid cell line (Fig. 1, C and D). In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the adapter protein CrkL interacts in an IFNα-dependent manner with Tyk-2 and is tyrosine-phosphorylated during IFNα stimulation, providing a link between the Type I IFN receptor and the C3G-Rap-1 growth-inhibitory pathway (9Ahmad S. Alsayed Y. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29991-29994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether CrkL associates with Stat5 during IFNα or IFNβ stimulation. In time course studies, Daudi cells were left untreated or treated for 10 or 20 min with IFNα or IFNβ. Cell lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with an anti-CrkL antibody, and then immunoblotted with an anti-Stat5 antibody. Stat5 was detected in association with CrkL after IFNα stimulation, establishing that this member of the Stat family of proteins associates with CrkL in an IFNα-dependent manner (Fig. 2,A and B). In contrast, there was no Stat1 present in anti-CrkL immunoprecipitates from IFNα-treated cells, 2S. Uddin and L. C. Platanias, unpublished observations. indicating that the CrkL-Stat5 interaction is selective. As Stat5 was found to be constitutively associated with the Tyk-2 kinase, while the CrkL interaction was IFNα-dependent, we determined whether Stat5 undergoes IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequently functions as a docking site for the SH2 domain of CrkL. In experiments in which Daudi or KG-1 cells were treated with IFNα for different times and the status of phosphorylation of Stat5 was examined, we observed that Stat5 is phosphorylated on tyrosine, suggesting that it acts as a substrate for the kinase activity of the associated Tyk-2 protein (Fig. 3, A andB, and data not shown). In addition, the SH2 domain of CrkL bound to the phosphorylated/activated form of both Stat5 isomers (a and b) in an IFNα-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C and D), confirming that Stat5 acts as a docking site for the CrkL SH2 domain and strongly suggesting that such an interaction mediates the formation of the CrkL-Stat5 complex.Figure 3The IFNα-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated form of Stat5 functions as a docking site for the SH2 domain of CrkL. A, Daudi cells were incubated in the presence or absence of IFNα for 20 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against Stat5b and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine.B, the blot shown in A was stripped and reprobed with the anti-Stat5b antibody. C, Daudi cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of IFNα. Cell lysates were bound to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encoding the SH2 domain of CrkL (GST-CkLSH2) or GST alone used as control. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against Stat5b. D, KG-1 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of IFNα. Cell lysates were bound to glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encoding the SH2 domain of CrkL (GST-CkLSH2) or GST alone used as control. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against Stat5b.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have shown that CrkL functions as an adapter, linking tyrosine kinases or their substrates to guanine exchange factors for small G proteins. Our finding that the protein interacts in an SH2-dependent manner with Stat5 suggested that it may also participate in the formation of DNA binding complexes that regulate transcription of interferon-stimulated genes. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the ability of CrkL to bind DNA using genomic DNA affinity chromatography (GDAC) (12Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Specifically, nuclear extracts from Daudi cells treated with IFNα or IFNβ were subjected to GDAC, and then the DNA-bound fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for CrkL (Fig. 4 A). CrkL bound DNA in an IFNα- or IFNβ-dependent manner (Fig.4 A), and its DNA-bound form migrated at approximately 140 kDa, strongly suggesting that such DNA binding occurs in a complex with Stat5. Furthermore, as CrkL was detectable in immunoblots of the nuclear extracts only after Type I IFN treatment, these data suggested that the protein translocates to the nucleus in a Type I IFN-dependent manner. Similarly, when the IFN-induced DNA-bound fractions collected following GDAC were immunoblotted with Stat5, we noticed that Stat5 was detectable in the same complex with CrkL (Fig. 4 B), strongly suggesting that it forms a DNA-binding complex in association with CrkL. Further analyses of these Type I IFN-induced nuclear extracts by gel shift assays, employing an oligonucleotide specific for Stat5 binding derived from the β-casein promoter, identified the presence of IFNα- or IFNβ-inducible DNA-binding complexes, whose mobilities were affected by inclusion of anti-CrkL antibodies (Fig.5 A) but not control RIgG (Fig.5 A and data not shown). The presence of Stat5 in these CrkL-containing complexes in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibodies to Stat5 (Fig.5 B). Thus, CrkL forms DNA-binding complexes in association with Stat5, strongly suggesting that it is involved in the regulation of Type I IFN-dependent gene expression. Our data provide strong evidence that CrkL, in cooperation with Stat5, binds DNA, and this complex likely functions as a transcription factor in IFNα/β-induced signaling. Indeed, we have observed this IFN-induced CrkL-Stat5 complex in other IFN-sensitive cell lines, namely human glial T98G and human osteosarcoma U2OS cells (data not shown). Such a role for CrkL was unexpected and raises the possibility that other related proteins, e.g. CrkII, Grb-2, may function as transcriptional activators in other signaling cascades. The members of this family of proteins have been previously shown to function as adapters, providing a link between receptor tyrosine kinases or their substrates and guanine exchange factors. Until now, there has been no evidence of their exhibiting DNA binding activity. CrkL has been shown to interact primarily with C3G (9Ahmad S. Alsayed Y. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

Regulation of Rap-1 activation by the CrkL-C3G complex appears to be critical for inhibition of T-cell proliferation and induction of anergy (20Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that CrkL interacts with a newly cloned member of the IRS family of proteins, IRS-4, in an IGF-1-dependent manner and that it has oncogenic potential when overexpressed in cell lines (21Koval A.P. Karas M. Zick Y. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 14780-14787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The current report implicates Stat5 in the engagement of CrkL in IFN signaling, as shown by the requirement of Stat5 as a docking site for the SH2 domain of CrkL. Most importantly, for the first time these data demonstrate that a Stat protein can act as a docking protein for the SH2 domain of a non-Stat protein to form a DNA-binding complex with it. Although, in the case of CrkL, this function appears to be specific for Stat5, it is likely that other Stats will be found to function in a similar manner in other systems. Recent reports have suggested that Stat5 is involved in IFNα signaling in myeloid cell lines and HeLa cells (5Meinke A. Barahmand-Pour F. Wohrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and its activation has been observed in response to differentiation and growth arrest signals (22Barahmand-pour F. Meinke A.

Our results strongly suggest that such functions for Stat5 require its interaction with and formation of a signaling complex with CrkL."

H2O2 (1–10 mm) caused a biphasic increase in free [Ca2+]i, an initial rise observed within 3 min and a second, much larger rise following a 30-min exposure. Extracellular calcium removal blocked the late, but not the initial, rise in [Ca2+]i. Thapsigargin did not affect either response to H2O2, but activated capacitive calcium entry, an action abolished by 10 μm La3+.

Oxidative stress, through the production of oxygen metabolites, particularly H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species (free radicals), results in destruction of many cell types through putative necrotic/apoptotic processes (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4450) Google Scholar, 2Olanow C.W. Ann. Neurol. 1992; : S2-S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Furthermore, excessive production of reactive oxygen species (e.g. via mitochondrial oxidation) has been causally related in the etiology of numerous degenerative disorders, including many age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (3Coyle J.T. Puttfarcken P. Science. 1993; 262: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (3533) Google Scholar, 4Richardson S.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Although reactive oxygen species have been implicated in cell death, the exact mechanism(s) are, as yet, unclear. A favored hypothesis is that H2O2 causes DNA strand breaks, leading to the activation of nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which critically depletes the cell of NAD, leading to eventual cell death (6Okamoto H. Bioessays. 1985; 2: 15-21Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has also been postulated that H2O2 disrupts the cell membrane integrity in a nonspecific manner through lipid peroxidation (7Gutteridge J.M.C. Halliwell B. Neurodegeneration and Neuroprotection in Parkinson's Disease. Academic Press Ltd., London1996: 1-21Google Scholar). However, there is also a good correlation between oxidative stress (H2O2 toxicity), induction of reactive oxygen species, and an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels immediately preceding the final destructive events (8Nicotera P. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Pancreatic beta cells have long been known to be particularly susceptible to oxidative stress-induced destruction (9Yu B.P. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar), making these cells useful models for mechanistic studies. Indeed, alloxan, which is toxic to pancreatic beta cells through the production of H2O2 and ultimately the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (⋅OH), (10Grankvist K. Marklund S. Sehlin J. Täljedal I.-B. Biochem. J. 1979; 182: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Fischer L.J. Hamburger S.A.

Mcletchie N.G.B. Lancet. 1943; 1: 484-487Google Scholar). This susceptibility has been correlated with a reduced capacity to withstand free radical attack through a limited cellular defense mechanism, as pancreatic beta cells have been reported to be deficient in glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase (14Grankvist K. Marklund S.L. Täljedal I.-B. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 15Tiedge M. Lortz S. Drinkgern J. Lenzen S.

Therefore, we have combined Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiological recordings of an insulin-secreting cell line (CRI-G1) to enable an investigation of the cellular consequences and mechanisms underlying mammalian cell responses to oxidative stress. Previously, it had been demonstrated, by intracellular recordings, that exposure to alloxan causes irreversible depolarization of mouse pancreatic beta cells (16Dean P.M. Matthews E.K. Diabetologia. 1972; 8: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These initial observations have more recently been substantiated using whole-cell recordings, which show that alloxan and H2O2, through the production of reactive oxygen species, cause complete and irreversible depolarization of CRI-G1 insulin-secreting cells (17Herson P.S. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501.1: 59-66Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that the H2O2-driven collapse of the membrane potential is mediated by the opening of a previously quiescent novel non-selective cation (NSNAD) channel. Although activated by oxidative stress in intact cells, this non-selective cation channel requires the presence of both Ca2+ and NAD on the cytoplasmic aspect of excised patches for channel activity to be observed (18Herson P.S. Dulock K.A. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505.1: 65-76Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Reale V. Hales C.N. Ashford M.L.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Permeation studies indicate that this channel has a significant conductance for divalent cations, most notably Ca2+ (18Herson P.S. Dulock K.A. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505.1: 65-76Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar); and therefore, oxidative stress-induced activation of this channel would be expected to allow a significant Ca2+ influx associated with the collapse of the membrane potential. We now report that exposure of CRI-G1 cells to concentrations of H2O2 that activate NSNAD channels causes a biphasic rise in [Ca2+]i. The second, late rise in [Ca2+]i induced by H2O2 reaches micromolar concentrations, indicating unregulated calcium influx. It is proposed that the second rise in [Ca2+]i is caused by H2O2-induced activation of NSNADchannels, leading to concurrent depolarization and eventual cell death through calcium overload. Some of these data have been reported previously in preliminary form (20Herson P.S. Lee K. Ashford M.L.J. Pinnock R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507P: P15-P16Google Scholar). Cells from the insulin-secreting cell line CRI-G1 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing sodium pyruvate (0.01%) and glucose (0.1%) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were passaged at 2–5-day intervals as described previously (21Carrington C.A. Rubery E.D. Pearson E.C. Hales C.N. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 109: 193-200Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), plated either onto glass coverslips or directly onto 3.5-cm Petri dishes at dilutions that provided a subconfluent cell density (Falcon 3001), and used 1–4 days after plating. Experiments were performed using whole-cell current and voltage clamp and single channel recording modes. Recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries and had resistances of 8–12 megaohms for outside-out recordings and 2–6 megaohms for whole-cell experiments when filled with electrolyte solution. Recordings were made using an Axopatch-1D or List EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier. Data were recorded onto digital audio tape and replayed for illustration onto a Gould TA 240 chart recorder. During current clamp experiments, hyperpolarizing current pulses (50 pA and 0.2-s duration) were applied every 5 s to monitor changes in input resistance. All voltage clamp experimental protocols were generated, and the resultant data were stored using PCLAMP6 (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and a Viglen PS/200 computer. In whole-cell voltage clamp recording mode, the membrane potential was held at −70 mV, and current-voltage relations were obtained by either applying 10-mV voltage steps of 200-ms duration with 100 ms between steps over the range −130 to −50 mV for H2O2-activated currents or 10-mV steps from −40 to +40 mV every 5 s when investigating Ba2+currents. The mean current amplitude of the final 50 ms of the voltage clamp current response for each voltage jump was plotted against the applied voltage to generate current-voltage relations. Typical values for the series resistance during whole-cell recordings were 10–18 megaohms. All values in the text are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between data sets was determined using unpaired Student's t test. For outside-out patch experiments, the pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 5.02 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), resulting in a free Ca2+concentration of 50 μm; and the bathing medium consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The pipette solution for whole-cell recordings contained 140 mm KCl, 0.6 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), resulting in a free Ca2+concentration in the low nanomolar range, before stimulation with H2O2, and allowing an increase in free Ca2+ concentration during stimulation. Some whole-cell recordings were performed with a pipette solution containing 140 mm KCl, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES in order to clamp intracellular Ca2+ in the low nanomolar range. The bath solution consisted of normal saline (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)). Additionally, when investigating voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel currents, the pipette contained 140 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 0.6 mmMgCl2, 2.73 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), resulting in a free Ca2+concentration of 100 nm; and the bath contained normal saline supplemented with Ba2+ (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm BaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)). After washing with normal saline supplemented with 3 mm glucose, the plated cells were incubated with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 45–120 min at room temperature (22–25 °C) prior to experiments in which [Ca2+]i was measured in intact cells. Single coverslips were mounted in a chamber on top of an inverted fluorescence microscope and perfused with normal saline plus 3 mm glucose. Measurements of [Ca2+]iin individual cells were made from the fluorescence ratio (excitation at 340/380 nm and emission at >510 nm for fura-2) using a specially designed filter wheel assembly, incorporating a CCD camera, a photomultiplier, and a suite of software (MAGICAL, Applied Imaging, Sunderland, United Kingdom) that samples emission following excitation at 340- and 380-nm wavelengths at 15-s intervals. [Ca2+]i was calculated from a calibration curve using the equation [Ca2+]i =K d·β·((R −R min )/(R max −R)), where R max,R min, and R are the maximum ratio, minimum ratio, and measured ratio, respectively; β is minimum 380/maximum 380; and K d represents the Ca2+ binding affinity of fura-2.R max, R min, and β were determined from free standing solutions of 2 and 0 mmCa2+o (+5 mm EGTA) in HEPES buffer solution as described previously (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Williams D.A. Fay F.S. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); these values did not vary significantly from day to day. Zero extracellular Ca2+ was obtained by the removal of CaCl2 from the normal saline as well as by the addition of 5 mm EGTA. All intact cell imaging was performed on at least three separate cultures, and numbers quoted (n) represent the number of individual cells analyzed. The intrinsic autofluorescence of cells, induced by the presence of reduced pyridine nucleotides, was examined without loading with fura-2/AM. Significant changes in autofluorescence were observed using excitation at 360 nm and emission at >510 nm. Methods for detecting [Ca2+]i in cells while recording in the whole-cell configuration were essentially the same as those used for intact cells, except that the pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 50 μm fura-2 (pH 7.2), and in some experiments, 10 mm EGTA was added to buffer intracellular Ca2+ to low nanomolar levels. The bath solution consisted of normal saline (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 3 mm glucose (pH 7.4)). Under these conditions in the cell-attached configuration, the fluorescence ratio indicated <10 nm free Ca2+i contamination of the pipette solution from stock reagents. In these experiments, the cells were viewed on an upright Zeiss Axioskop microscope with the appropriate dichroic mirror (405 nm) and trinocular mounting to send the emitted light to the photomultiplier tube (PHOCAL, Life Sciences Resources, Basingstoke, United Kingdom). Fura-2 and fura-2/AM were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Thapsigargin was from Calbiochem (Badsoden, Germany), and all other chemicals were from Sigma (Poole, United Kingdom). All solution changes were achieved by superfusing the bath with a gravity-feed system at a rate of ∼10 ml/min, which allowed complete bath exchange within 2 min. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Intact CRI-G1 cells were loaded with fura-2/AM, and the effect of H2O2 on the fura-2 ratio ([Ca2+]i) was monitored. The addition of either 1 or 10 mm H2O2 to the extracellular medium resulted in a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i(Fig. 1 A). Although the [Ca2+]i response to 1 and 10 mmH2O2 differed temporally (data not shown), the magnitude of both the early and late phases of increased [Ca2+]i was indistinguishable (p> 0.05). The initial rise occurred within 3 min, and the fura-2 ratio increased from an initial resting level of 0.44 ± 0.01 (∼57 nm) to 0.93 ± 0.02 (190 nm;n = 72). The second, late response occurred ∼30 min later (∼40 min for 1 mm H2O2) and induced a rise to near-dye saturation (fura ratio > 2; >1 μm Ca2+i). Removal of extracellular calcium by the addition of 5 mm EGTA decreased the initial rise in [Ca2+]i (ratio rising from 0.40 ± 0.01 (48 nm) to 0.73 ± 0.02 (130 nm);n = 52; p < 0.01) and completely abolished the second rise induced by 10 mmH2O2 (Fig. 1 B). The re-addition of extracellular calcium resulted in an immediate increase in [Ca2+]i, again rising to near-dye saturation, indicating that a calcium permeation pathway had been activated by the H2O2 exposure. These results indicate that the H2O2-induced early increase in intracellular calcium levels results predominantly from mobilization of Ca2+i from an intracellular source and that the second, late increase in intracellular calcium levels is a result of extracellular calcium influx. Previous studies examining the consequences of mammalian cell exposure to reactive oxygen species have generally been inconclusive with respect to the identity of the permeation pathway for the oxidative stress-induced rise in [Ca2+]i consequent to Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium. There are reports that implicate voltage-gated calcium channels (through the use of organic Ca2+ channel blockers) as the source of calcium influx (24Albano E. Bellomo G. Parola M. Carini R. Dianzani M.U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Roveri A. Coassin M. Maiorino M. Zamburlini A. Van Amsterdam F.T. Ratti E. Ursini F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whereas others indicate that such a pathway is unlikely (26Bielefeldt K. Whiteis C.A. Sharma R.V. Abboud F.M. Conklin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1439-G1450PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kaneko M. Matsumoto Y. Hayashi H. Kobayashi A. Yamazaki N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Even if voltage-gated calcium channels were not the primary path, reactive oxygen species-derived depolarization of cells could activate these channels, which could then secondarily contribute to the increased intracellular calcium levels. To examine whether voltage-gated calcium channels contribute in any way to the H2O2-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in CRI-G1 cells, 100 μmCd2+ was applied to the extracellular environment of the cells. This concentration of Cd2+ completely inhibits voltage-gated calcium currents (n = 5) in this cell line, an action partially reversible on washout of the Cd2+(Fig. 2 A). As further verification that Cd2+ inhibits the function of voltage-gated calcium channels in these cells, the increased [Ca2+]i response associated with a depolarization-induced (40 mm K+) calcium influx was shown to be completely prevented by 100 μmCd2+ (n = 12) (Fig. 2 B). However, in the presence of extracellular calcium, co-application of 100 μm Cd2+ and 10 mmH2O2 failed to inhibit the H2O2-induced rise in [Ca2+]i, with the fura-2 ratio increasing to dye saturation (n = 13) (Fig.3 A). The presence of Cd2+ did produce a striking change in the time course of the [Ca2+]i response in that the second phase of the H2O2-induced increase in [Ca2+]i occurred almost immediately on application of the oxidative stress, with no obvious evidence of the initial [Ca2+]i response (n = 20). This acceleration of the [Ca2+]i response is possibly consistent with Cd2+ catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 to form reactive oxygen species (9Yu B.P. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). The effects of Cd2+ on [Ca2+]i were also examined in the absence of extracellular calcium, and Cd2+ was demonstrated to have no effect on [Ca2+]i per se and did not alter the initial H2O2-induced rise in [Ca2+]i (ratio rising from 0.37 ± 0.01 (42 nm) to 0.83 ± 0.06 (155 nm);p > 0.05 compared with data in the absence of Cd2+). However, re-addition of 1 mmCa2+-containing extracellular solution in the continued presence of Cd2+ induced a rapid, large increase in [Ca2+]i (n = 13) (Fig.2 B). Consequently, it appears highly unlikely that activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels is responsible for, or contributes significantly to, the H2O2-induced second, late phase of increased [Ca2+]i in CRI-G1 cells.Figure 3Cd2+ does not inhibit H2O2-induced Ca2+ influx. A, fluorescence measurements of fura-2/AM-loaded CRI-G1 cells showing a rapid and maximal increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels caused by the application of 10 mmH2O2 in the presence of 100 μmCd2+. Note the highly accelerated rate of the [Ca2+] rise compared with Fig. 1 A.B, separate experiment illustrating the lack of effect of 100 μm Cd2+ on Ca2+ per se and the effect of subsequent addition of 10 mmH2O2 plus Cd2+ to the bathing medium in the absence of extracellular calcium, which caused a small sustained rise in intracellular calcium levels. The re-addition of extracellular calcium in the continued presence of Cd2+resulted in an immediate massive rise in Ca2+ levels, which reached near-dye saturation (>1 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Another possible contributor to this second, large rise in [Ca2+]i is by means of an intracellular Ca2+-triggered capacitive entry system for Ca2+(I CRAC) that has somehow become unregulated by the presence of H2O2. The data described above indicate that the initial phase of increased [Ca2+]i in response to H2O2 challenge is due to mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores. Consequently, the possibility that the calcium originates from microsomal stores was investigated using thapsigargin, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor that depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores by blocking the uptake of calcium (28Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The addition of 1 μmthapsigargin to intact cells resulted in a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i, which peaked and then declined, but did not return to initial pre-thapsigargin levels (Fig.4 A), with the fura-2 ratio increasing from 0.41 ± 0.01 (50 nm) to 0.83 ± 0.03 (155 nm) and then plateauing to a new level of 0.59 ± 0.02 (90 nm) (n = 32). Following thapsigargin treatment, removal of extracellular calcium decreased [Ca2+]i to a level below that seen in control experiments, 0.32 ± 0.01 (32 nm;p < 0.05). The subsequent addition of 10 mm H2O2 resulted in a response indistinguishable from that of cells not exposed to thapsigargin (Fig.1 A), i.e. an initial sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, with the fura-2 ratio rising from 0.32 ± 0.01 (32 nm) to 0.76 ± 0.02 (137 nm) (p > 0.05), followed by a second, larger rise following re-addition of extracellular Ca2+, reaching near-dye saturation. It is therefore clear that H2O2 mobilizes intracellular calcium from a thapsigargin-insensitive source. Previous studies have demonstrated that emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores in pancreatic beta cells triggers capacitive calcium entry throughI CRAC (29Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar, 30Miura Y. Henquin J.-C. Gilon P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503.2: 387-398Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that low (10–100 μm) concentrations of La3+ inhibit this process (31Preuß K.-D. Nöller J.K. Krause E. Göbel A. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 240: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the CRI-G1 cells, emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin resulted in the activation ofI CRAC. This can be seen (Fig. 4, Aand B) by removal and re-addition of extracellular calcium, which resulted in [Ca2+]i transients not observed without exposure to thapsigargin (n = 32 and 24 with and without thapsigargin, respectively). The induction of [Ca2+]i transients indicative ofI CRAC activation in these cells was maximally and reversibly inhibited by the presence of 10 μmLa3+ (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the presence of 10 μm La3+ did not abolish the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (n = 13) induced by 10 mm H2O2, although there was an ∼30% inhibition (Fig. 4 B). However, application of 100 μm La3+ did eradicate the second [Ca2+]i transient due to H2O2-induced Ca2+ influx (n = 24) (Fig. 4 C), an action that was reversible, as washout of the La3+ in the continued presence of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in eventual massive influx of Ca2+. Consequently, these data indicate that the H2O2-induced Ca2+ influx is pharmacologically distinct from the I CRACpathway in these cells and also exclude a nonspecific membrane breakdown as mediator of Ca2+ entry. The identity of the Ca2+ entry pathway responsible for the second, late increase in [Ca2+]i induced by H2O2 in CRI-G1 cells was investigated using whole-cell current clamp recordings with 50 μm fura-2 in the intracellular solution in order to monitor simultaneously membrane potential and the levels of free intracellular calcium. After initiation of the whole-cell recording mode, the cell interior was dialyzed with an ATP-free solution, which resulted in cell hyperpolarization (Fig. 5 A,upper trace). The membrane potential changed from an initial resting value of approximately −40 mV to a new stable potential of −74 ± 1.8 mV (n = 6). Concomitant with the hyperpolarization was a decrease in cell input resistance. This hyperpolarization and decreased input resistance are due to the opening of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels as internal ATP is washed out of the cell (17Herson P.S. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501.1: 59-66Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Trube G. Rorsman P. Ohno-Shosaku T. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Following stabilization of the membrane potential and input resistance, application of 10 mm H2O2 caused a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5 A, lower trace), which preceded any effect on membrane potential. This increase occurred within 3 min (2.6 ± 0.2 min; n= 6), and the fura-2 ratio rose from 0.45 ± 0.02 (46 nm) to 0.87 ± 0.08 (150 nm). There was then a further delay of ∼10–12 min before a second phase of increased [Ca2+]i was observed (fura-2 ratio rising from 0.87 ± 0.08 to 1.94 ± 0.16 (>600 nm)) (Fig. 5 A, lower trace). These [Ca2+]i responses to 10 mmH2O2 almost exactly recapitulated those obtained in intact cells. The decreased delay for the second phase of increased [Ca2+]i during whole-cell recordings in comparison with intact cells is likely due to dialysis of the cells' natural antioxidant protective mechanisms (e.g.glutathione). The second, late phase of increased [Ca2+]i coincided with the appearance of a slow, irreversible depolarization to ∼0 mV. This H2O2-induced depolarization is consistent with our previous report on the action of H2O2 in this cell line (17Herson P.S. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501.1: 59-66Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether the later large increase in [Ca2+]i induced by H2O2is dependent upon the initial increase in [Ca2+]i, simultaneous recordings of membrane potential and [Ca2+]i were made with 10 mm EGTA included in the intracellular pipette solution to clamp the [Ca2+]i to low nanomolar levels. As illustrated in Fig. 5 B, the inclusion of 10 mmEGTA in the pipette clamped the [Ca2+]i below the resting level (0.26 ± 0.01; <1 nm), and this did not change after application of 10 mmH2O2. Furthermore, although the reduction in intracellular calcium had no effect on the hyperpolarization induced by the washout of the internal ATP (the mean cell hyperpolarization was to −75 ± 2.4 mV; n = 4), it completely prevented the H2O2-induced depolarization (Fig.5 B, lower trace). Clearly, activation of the late phase of increased [Ca2+]i by H2O2 is dependent upon the initial rise in calcium levels, is through a specific permeation pathway, and is consequent to the depolarization of the cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that the H2O2-induced depolarization of CRI-G1 cells is due to the opening of a novel non-selective cation conductance (NSNAD channel), which also allows permeation of Ca2+ (17Herson P.S. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501.1: 59-66Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Herson P.S. Dulock K.A. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505.1: 65-76Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Activation of this channel by H2O2 is shown in Fig.6, where cell-attached single channel recordings from CRI-G1 cells were performed. Following application of H2O2 (4.4 mm), there was a delay of ∼9–10 min before the appearance of single channel currents (Fig.6 A). This current was characterized by a linear current-voltage relation with a conductance of 70 pS 1The abbreviation used is: S, siemens. and a reversal potential of 0 mV (Fig. 6, B and C). Excision of the patch into the inside-out configuration resulted in loss of channel activity, which could only be recovered by application of NAD to the cytoplasmic aspect of the membrane patch (Fig. 6 C), identifying the channel as NSNAD (17Herson P.S. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501.1: 59-66Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We also examined the likelihood that this channel is responsible for the late phase of Ca2+ entry induced by H2O2 by determining the sensitivity of this conducting pathway to inhibition by La3+. Following attainment of the whole-cell recording configuration (Fig. 7 A), the conductance of the cell was small (1.46 ± 0.54 nS;n = 3), with a reversal potential of −42.3 ± 4.0 mV (n = 3), which is close to the cell resting membrane potential of approximately −40 mV.

Itk is expressed primarily in T cells and activated by TCR/CD3, CD28, and CD2. However, the defect in T cell signaling in itk-deficient mice is very modest. Thus, we looked for other Tec family kinases that could be expressed in lymphoid cells and involved in T cell signal transduction. Here, we demonstrate that Tec, expressed in T cells, is activated following TCR/CD3 or CD28 ligation and interacts with CD28 receptor in an activation-dependent manner. This interaction involves the Tec SH3 domain and the proline-rich motifs in CD28. We also show that Tec can phosphorylate p62dok, one CD28-specific substrate, whereas Itk cannot. Overexpression of Tec but not Itk can enhance the interleukin-2 promoter activity mediated by TCR/CD3 or CD28 stimulation and introduction of a kinase-dead Tec but not Itk can suppress interleukin-2 expression, indicating that Tec is directly involved in T cell activation.

They are all characterized by a pleckstrin homology domain (PH)1 (except Rlk/Txk), a Tec homology domain (TH) containing a region homologous to the GAP1 family of Ras GTPases at the N terminus and one or two proline-rich motifs at its C terminus (2Vihinen M.

In the unactivated state, the interaction of Itk SH3 domain with the proline-rich motif (KPLPPTP) present in its TH domain would result in an intramolecular binding that could prevent the interaction of these domains with other cellular interaction motifs and probably inhibit their enzymatic activity.

Itk is activated by various T cell surface receptors such as TCR/CD3, CD28, and CD2 (21August A. Gibson S. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Mills G.B. Dupont B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, mice lacking Itk have both decreased numbers of mature thymocytes and reduced proliferative responses to allogeneic major histocompatibility complex stimulation or TCR cross-linking (23Liao X.C. Littman D.R. Immunity. 1995; 3: 757-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These signaling defects of the antigen receptors can be overcome by stimulation with phorbol esters (PMA) and calcium ionophores (ionomycin), indicating that this protein kinase functions at an early stage in the signaling pathways. Tec is expressed in most hematopoietic cells (24Mano H. Mano K. Tang B. Koehler M. Yi T. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Ihle J.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar) and B cells (25Kitanaka A. Mano H. Conley M.E. Campana D. Blood. 1998; 91: 940-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

So far, Tec functions are hardly understood, and its substrates still remain to be identified. However, it was recently suggested that Tec can phosphorylate Jak-2 and the transient expression of Tec in BAF3 cells resulted in the marked elevation of the promoter activity of the c-fosproto-oncogene (30Ohya K.I. Kajigaya S. Yamashita Y. Miyazato A. Hatake K. Miura Y. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Ozawa K. Mano H. J. Biol.

The full activation of T cells requires both interaction of the TCR with antigen bound to major histocompatibility complex molecules and costimulatory signals. The major costimulatory molecule is the adhesion molecule CD28 that interacts with its ligands B7.1/CD80 and B7.2/CD86 on antigen presenting cells. These two signals induce T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and regulation of T cell apoptosis and survival. The signaling pathways for TCR/CD3 stimulation and CD28 costimulation still remain poorly understood. TCR/CD3 or CD28 signal transduction induces various biochemical events inclusive of calcium mobilization, tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream substrates, PTK activation, activation of PI 3-kinase, and activation of p21ras. TCR/CD3 and CD28 must recruit PTKs to phosphorylate their substrates upon activation since they lack intrinsic kinase activities. For example, it has been shown that Lck, Fyn, ZAP-70, and Itk can be recruited and activated in TCR/CD3 pathway and that Lck, Fyn, and Itk can be recruited and activated in CD28 pathway. Although similar PTKs can be recruited, TCR/CD3 and CD28 induce phosphorylation of their specific substrates such as SLP-76 (p76) and LAT (p36/38) for TCR/CD3 and p62dok and the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (32Lu Y.

PTKs are critical for T cell signaling since inhibition of PTKs abrogated the substrate phosphorylation and IL-2 production. Nevertheless, in theitk-deficient mice, CD3-mediated proliferative response was severely compromised, whereas CD28-mediated proliferation was significantly enhanced when compared with cells from control animals (36Liao X.C. Fournier S. Killeen N. Weiss A. Allison J.P. Littman D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Itk negatively regulates the amplitude of CD28 costimulation. Intriguingly, instead of being involved in the amplification of IL-2 production which is the hallmark of CD28 costimulation, Itk could down-modulate these events. These observations prompted us to look for other Tec family kinases that could be expressed in lymphoid cells and involved in the amplification of IL-2 production. Here, we demonstrate that Tec kinase is also expressed in T cells and activated on TCR/CD3 or CD28 stimulation. We also show that Tec inducibly binds to CD28 via SH3 domain proline-rich motif interaction and Tec can phosphorylate in vivo p62dok protein, a Ras GAP-associated adaptor that can be phosphorylated in CD28 but not TCR/CD3 pathway. Furthermore, Tec but not Itk can induce IL-2 promoter activity. In addition, kinase-dead Tec can suppress IL-2 activation in TCR/CD3 and CD28 pathways. These data suggest that two Tec family kinases, namely Itk and Tec, are involved in T cell signal transduction and that Tec is a likely candidate for regulating T cell activation. Murine T hybridoma parental cells DC27.1, clone DWT6.11+− expressing wild-type huCD28 cDNA, mutant DYF173+200 where Tyr has been substituted by Phe at positions 173 and 200, and DEL 21 where 21 amino acids in the C terminus of CD28 have been truncated and contained no functional proline-rich motifs were previously described (37Pages F.

Here we renamed clones DWT6.11+- and DYF173+200 for WT and Y173F+Y200F. Clones P181A+P183A, P193A, and P194A were derived from DC27.1 cells that were stably transfected with the plasmids PSRαCD28P181A+P183A, PSRαCD28P193A, and PSRαCD28P194A. Clone WTHAp62dok was obtained from WT stably transfected with the plasmid pMSCV-HADok. All T murine hybridoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, β-mercaptoethanol, sodium pyruvate, and glutamate. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamate. Besides human Jurkat T leukemia cells JH6.2 (38Nunes J.A. Collette Y. Truneh A. Olive D. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp.

Expression plasmids pSRαCD28, p48Src, pF10, and BtkHA containing human wild-type CD28, Src, Fyn, and Btk tagged with HA epitope cDNAs were gifts from Drs. R. Sweet, S. Courtneige, C. Bebbington, and R. Guinamard. Expression plasmids pCDNALck, pCDNAItkflag, and pCDNAHAp62dokpossessing Lck, Itk tagged in 3′ end, and p62dok tagged with HA epitope were constructed by subcloning of pSMLck gifted from Dr. M. Marsh, p52.2.1, a gift from Dr. S. Desiderio, and pMSCV-HADok gifted from Dr. Y. Yamanashi to pCDNA3 vector, respectively. Plasmid pCDNAflagTec containing a wild-type full-length murine Tec cDNA tagged with the FLAG epitope in 5′ end was described previously. This enzyme corresponds to the full-length enzyme, type IV or TecA (24Mano H. Mano K. Tang B. Koehler M. Yi T. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Ihle J.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pCDNAflagTeckd was the kinase-dead version of pCDNAflagTec with a point mutation at the ATP-binding site of Tec corresponding to amino acid 397 (Lys to Glu). pCDNAItkkdflag was the kinase-dead version of pCDNAItkflag with a point mutation at the ATP-binding site of Itk corresponding to amino acid 396 (Lys to Glu). Plasmid prCD2flagTec was constructed by in frame subcloning TecEcoRI fragment of pCDNAflagTec downstream of rat CD2 corresponding to amino acids 1–219 in pCDNArCD2BE vector. Plasmid prCD2flagTeckd was a kinase-dead version of prCD2Tec with a point mutation at the ATP-binding site of Tec corresponding to amino acid 397 (Lys to Glu). Plasmids PSRαCD28P181A+P183A, PSRαCD28P193A, and PSRαCD28P194A in which human CD28 was point-mutated from Pro to Ala at amino acid residues 181 and 183, 193, and 194, respectively, were generated using the Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GST fusion plasmids pGSTTECSH1, pGSTTECSH2, and pGSTTECSH3 were constructed by respectively subcloning the polymerase chain reaction product of SH1, SH2, and SH3 regions of Tec into pGEX4T3 vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). pGSTTEC5N containing PH and TH region of Tec has been described previously (12Tang B. Mano H. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8432-8437Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These constructs are further depicted in Fig. 3. pGSTITKSH3 containing Itk SH3 domain was a gift from Dr. R. Guinamard. The promoter assay plasmids pIL-2-Luc composed of IL-2 promoter fused with firefly luciferase reporter gene and pβ-actin-RLuc composed of β-actin promoter fused with Renilla luciferase reporter gene were gifts from Drs. E. Verdin (39Ott M. Emiliani S. Van L.C. Herbein G. Lovett J. Chirmule N. McCloskey T. Pahwa S. Verdin E. Science. 1997; 275: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and R. Castellano, respectively. Anti-human CD28 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 248, CD28.2, and CD28.6 and anti-human CD3 mAb 289 have already been described (40Nunes J. Klasen S. Ragueneau M. Pavon C.

The anti-Itk, anti-Tec, anti-p62dok rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against murine Itk, Tec, and p62dok proteins using synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 605–625 (DRPPFSQLLSQLAEIAEAGL), amino acid residues 162–179 (EIKKRRPPPPIPPEEENT), and amino acid residues 424–437 (PQGLILPESGTTRGS), respectively. Anti-Itk mAb Tuk-N1 has been previously described (41Tanaka N. Abe H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 834-841PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG and 4G10 mAbs were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. Anti-rat CD2 mAb (OX34) was a kind gift from Dr. D. A. Cantrell (London, UK) and 145 2C11 mAb is a hamster IgG specific for murine CD3 ε chain (ATCC). Anti-Lck, anti-Src, and anti-phosphotyrosine antisera were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM) antiserum was from Jackson ImmunoResearch. CD28-bound beads was obtained by incubation of CD28.2 mAb with avidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Immunotech) bound to biotinylated GAM (Jackson ImmunoResearch) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Immunotech, France). Ten million cells per ml medium were stimulated at 37 °C for 2 min with 10 μg of CD28.2 mAb, then cross-linked with 30 μg of GAM antiserum for 5 min at 37 °C. For nonstimulated controls, 10 × 106 of cells per ml of medium were left at 37 °C for 2 min and then cross-linked with 30 μg of GAM antiserum for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmorthovanadate) on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. Postnuclear supernatants were precipitated with antibody. The precipitates were washed and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then electro-transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and the membrane was probed with antibody. Alternatively, 10 × 106 cells per ml of medium were stimulated at 4 °C for 15 min with 20 μg of CD28 mAb bound to beads and prepared according to the above described protocol. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer, and CD28 molecules were precipitated using a magnet. For nonstimulated control, 10 × 106 cells per ml of medium were left unstimulated at 4 °C for 15 min, lysed, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. Postnuclear lysates were precipitated also with CD28 mAb bound to beads. The precipitates were processed as described above. The bacterial hosts Escherichia coliDH5α or BL21, transformed with GST fusion plasmids, were cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). GST fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). For pulldown precipitation, 5 × 106 hybridoma cells were stimulated, lysed, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. Postnuclear lysates were incubated with 10 μg of GST recombinant protein coupled with Sepharose at 4 °C overnight, and the precipitates were treated as described above. COS-7 (6 × 106) cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method as described (42Andrea L. Etienne J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 216-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The immune complex containing Tec was precipitated from T murine hybridoma cells expressing endogenous Tec with anti-Tec polyclonal antiserum and then washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4). The immune complex was then incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 1 h. The immune complex was subjected to gel electrophoresis, and gels were dried and phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by autoradiography. Jurkat cells (10 × 106) were electroporated at 960 microfarads and 250 V using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with 15 μg of pIL-2-Luc plasmid, 5 μg of pβ-actin-RLuc, and 15 μg of the other plasmids expressing Tec and Itk or their mutants. The cells were incubated for 2 h and then left unstimulated or stimulated for 6 h with PMA (Sigma, 50 ng/ml), PMA plus 248 (1/400 dilution), or PMA plus 289 (10 μg/ml). Following the centrifugation, the cells were washed and lysed. Proteins were quantified by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Ten μg of cell lysates were subjected to dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The efficiency of transfection was corrected by the activity of firefly luciferase normalized by that ofRenilla luciferase in the lysates. Four isoforms of Tec protein-tyrosine kinase type I to type IV (527, 608, 602, and 630 aa long) have been described, resulting from alternative splicing (26Mano H. Yamashita Y. Sato K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1995; 85: 343-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They have estimated molecular masses of 62, 70, 68, and 72 kDa, respectively. The largest type IV which has an estimated molecular mass of 72 kDa is also known as TecA. For clarity we will hereafter refer to TecA/Tec type IV as Tec. By using specific anti-Tec antiserum, Tec with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa was found to be predominantly expressed in all cell lines examined here with the exception of fibroblast cell line (Fig.1 A). These cells include a monocytic cell line (THP1), B cell lines (Nalm6, BAF3, and U266), a myeloid cell line (KG1a), T cell lines (WT and JH6.2), and resting T cells. Moreover, another Tec isoform with 70 kDa can be found in myeloid cell line KG1a, pro-B cell line BAF3, and T hybridoma cell line WT (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2, 5, and 7). The other band at 79 kDa as described previously by Kitanaka et al. (25Kitanaka A. Mano H. Conley M.E. Campana D. Blood. 1998; 91: 940-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is probably nonspecific since it does not correspond to any predicted molecular weight of Tec protein, is expressed in the fibroblast cell line, and is not detected in COS-7 transfected with Tec plasmid (data not shown). Fig. 1 B illustrates the anti-Tec antiserum specificity since anti-Tec antiserum can only recognize Tec but not Itk or Btk protein expressed in COS-7 cells. Hence, Tec is expressed in lymphoid cell lines, primary resting T cells and myeloid cell line. Itk, a member of Tec family kinases, has been shown to be expressed in T cells and be activated following TCR/CD3 or CD28 ligation. Because the defect in T cell signaling in itk-deficient mice is quite modest and Tec kinase is expressed in T cells, we wanted to know whether another Tec family kinase member, Tec kinase, could be involved in T cell signaling. To evaluate Tec activation, in vitroautokinase assay indicating the Tec kinase activity (Fig.2 A, upper panel) and Western blotting to quantify the Tec kinase amount in each lane (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) were carried out. Relative activity is shown at thebottom of Fig. 2 A. Ligation of CD3 or CD28 on the CD28-transfected hybridoma line (WT) elicited a 2.3- or 2-fold increase in Tec autokinase activity, respectively (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2and 3), in contrast to non-stimulated condition (Fig.2 A, lane 4). As in autokinase assay, tyrosine phosphorylation in different stimulations was also evaluated by immunoblot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2 B). Relative activity is shown at the bottom of Fig.2 B. Ligation of CD3 or CD28 on the CD28-transfected hybridoma line (WT) also induced a 3- or 3.2-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation level. The increase in relative activity of Tec following ligation was relatively modest but reproducible because Tec family kinases have a much lower autokinase activity than Src family kinases, and there is no known substrate available for evaluating their transphosphorylation activity. For example, the relative activity of Itk is about 2–3-fold following CD28 or CD3 ligation (43Gibson S. August A. Branch D. Dupont B. Mills G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7079-7083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 44Gibson S. August A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, these results suggest that Tec can be involved in TCR/CD3 or CD28 pathway in T cells. Tec expression in T cells and activation following CD28 ligation incited us to determine how Tec is involved in CD28 signaling. Indeed, another member of the Tec family Itk/Emt/Tsk is expressed in T cells and inducibly binds to CD28 (21August A. Gibson S. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Mills G.B. Dupont B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9347-9351Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This interaction implicates Itk SH3 domain and the first proline-rich motif of CD28 (45Marengere L.E. Okkenhaug K. Clavreul A. Couez D. Gibson S. Mills G.B. Mak T.W. Rottapel R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3220-3229PubMed Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 3, endogenous Tec inducibly bound to CD28 following cross-linking (Fig. 2, lane 3), although a weak association was found in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2, lane 2). Hence, Tec can bind to CD28 in vivo in an activation-dependent manner. In our hybridoma T cells, Itk associated with CD28 receptor following its cross-linking (data not shown), confirming previous works (45Marengere L.E. Okkenhaug K. Clavreul A. Couez D. Gibson S. Mills G.B. Mak T.W. Rottapel R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3220-3229PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ratio of Itk and Tec that became recruited to CD28 receptor in comparison to the total kinase amount detected in total cell lysates was similar (data not shown). This may mean that both Tec and Itk play similarly important roles in CD28 pathway. Tec possesses various domains that are likely candidates for protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction, PH, TH, SH3, and SH2 domains. So far, the only region of Tec involved in its functional interaction with defined proteins is its TH domain that binds to protein kinase, adaptor molecules, and to the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit (9Mano H.

The obtained results demonstrate that the widely distributed thyroglobulin type-1 domains can support a variety of functions. The recently discovered thyroglobulin type-1 domain inhibitors, thyropins, are a group of proteins that have the ability to inhibit both cysteine (1Lenarčič B. Bevec T. Biol.

Thyroglobulin type-1 domain is a structural element first found in thyroglobulin, a molecule that serves as the precursor of the thyroid hormone and in which three different types of cysteine-rich domains are present (3Malthiery Y.

It is a reversible and tightly binding competitive inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteinases. Sequence data (SWISS-PROT accession number P8149) have shown that the inhibitor has an M r of 21,755 and is composed of three repeated thyroglobulin type-1 domains (13Lenarčič B. Ritonja A. Štrukelj B. Turk B. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13899-13903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Lenarčič B. Ritonja A. Štrukelj B. Turk B. Turk V. J. Biol.

The first domain (eq d-1) has 43% sequence identity with the second domain (eq d-2) and 49% with the third domain (eq d-3), whereas eq d-2 and eq d-3 show 32% identity. In the present study we have examined the inhibitory activity of the thyroglobulin type-1 domains present in equistatin. This has been done by dissecting the molecule by limited proteolysis into folded domain structures, isolating the domains and investigating their inhibitory activities against the cysteine proteinase: papain; a number of aspartic proteinases: cathepsin D, pepsin, chymosin, and HIV-PR; and serine proteinase: trypsin. Equistatin from A. equina and β-trypsin were prepared as described (Refs. 13Lenarčič B. Ritonja A. Štrukelj B. Turk B. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13899-13903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar and 16Štrop P. Čechova D. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 207: 55-62Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, respectively). Cathepsin D was purified from human and porcine liver using a procedure slightly modified from that previously described (17Kregar I. Urh I. Umezawa H. Turk V. Croat. Chem. Acta. 1977; 49: 587-592Google Scholar). Papain (crystallized twice) was obtained from Sigma and further purified by affinity chromatography (18Blumberg S. Schechter I. Berger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Pepstatin (a specific inhibitor of aspartic proteinases), porcine pepsin, and calf chymosin were also purchased from Sigma, and chromogenic substrate H-Pro-Thr-Glu-Phe-Phe(NO2)-Arg-Leu-OH was from Novabiochem. The HIV-PR and its substrate Ala-Thr-His-Gln-Val-Tyr-Phe(NO2)-Val-Arg-Lys-Ala were generously provided by Dr. Bruce Korant. Equistatin was subjected to limited proteolysis with β-trypsin, 500 μg being incubated with 5 μg of β-trypsin in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, for 40 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid. The β-trypsin digest of equistatin was separated by high performance liquid chromatography (Milton Roy Co.) using a reverse-phase Vydac C18 column equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was performed using a linear gradient of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. Peptide fractions were collected and assayed for inhibitory activities toward papain and cathepsin D. The same HPLC conditions were used when the mixture of equistatin and cathepsin D was applied. Prior to application the inhibitor and the enzyme were incubated in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.7, at 37 °C. The incubation time was 2 h, and the concentration of the proteinase was 30% (w/w). An Applied Biosystems liquid pulse sequencer 475A connected on line to a phenylthiohydantoin analyzer 120A from the same manufacturer was used for automated amino acid sequence analyses. SDS-PAGE was performed using PhastSystem apparatus (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Samples and molecular weight markers ranging from 14,000–94,000 (Pharmacia) were run in the presence of 5% SDS on an 8–25% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoretic separation under native conditions was carried out using the same apparatus. The 12.5% homogeneous polyacrylamide gel and buffer strips having a pH of approximately 4.1 were used. The complex was made by mixing 10 μm porcine cathepsin D and 40 μm equistatin in 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. To identify proteins migrating on native PAGE, microsequencing of the separated proteins was performed. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked into transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 100 mm glycine, and 20% methanol, pH 8.6) for 10 min. During this time a PVDF difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) was rinsed with 100% methanol and stored in transfer buffer. The gel, sandwiched between a sheet of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and several sheets of blotting paper, was assembled into a blotting apparatus (Biometra) and electro-eluted for 1 h at 65 mV in transfer buffer. The PVDF membrane was washed in deionized water for 5 min. Proteins electroblotted onto PVDF membranes were stained with 0.05% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 1 min and cut out. Membranes were destained with 50% methanol, air-dried, and placed in the cartridge block of the sequenator. Protein concentrations were determined from absorbance at 280 nm using molar absorption coefficients calculated from the amino acid sequences (19Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). A molar absorption coefficient of 33,700 m−1cm−1 was calculated for equistatin, 13,355m−1 cm−1 for eq d-1, 20,345m−1 cm−1 for eq d-2,3, 49,320m−1 cm−1 for cathepsin D, 52,185m−1 cm−1 for pepsin, and 54,090m−1 cm−1 for chymosin. The concentration of papain was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient of 56,200 m−1cm−1 (20Brocklehurst K. Carlson J. Kierstan M.P.J. Crook E.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Pepstatin, a tightly binding inhibitor of cathepsin D, was used to titrate human cathepsin D, pepsin, and chymosin. The active site titrated cathepsin D was then used to determine the active concentrations of equistatin, eq d-1, and eq d-2,3 as follows. Cathepsin D (final concentration, 0.1 μm) was incubated with increasing amounts of pepstatin (final concentration, 0–1.5 μm) in 390 μl of 0.1m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.1. After 30 min of incubation, 10 μl of 10 mmH-Pro-Thr-Glu-Phe-Phe(NO2)-Arg-Leu-OH was added. The initial cleavage rates were monitored as a function of decreasing absorbance at 300 nm with Perkin-Elmer Lambda 18 Spectrophotometer (21Dunn B.M. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5241-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The equilibrium dissociation constants (K i) for the interaction between the equistatin, eq d-1, or eq d-2,3 and cathepsin D were determined by the equilibrium method. The procedure (see previous paragraph) was repeated with lower concentrations of cathepsin D (final concentration, 6.4 nm) and inhibitors (final concentration, 0–10 nm). K i was obtained from the dependence of (v i /v o) onI according to the equationv i /v o =(E/2){[E − I −K i] + [(K i + I− E)2 − 4K i E]1/2}, wherev i and v o are velocities with and without inhibitor, respectively, I is the inhibitor concentration, and E is the enzyme concentration (22Greco W.R. Hakala M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12104-12109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The potential inhibitory properties of equistatin against pepsin (12.5 nm), chymosin (12 nm), and HIV-PR (30 nm) were tested in a same way as against cathepsin D. Papain purified by affinity chromatography (18Blumberg S. Schechter I. Berger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) had a thiol content of 0.92 ± 0.05 mol/mol of enzyme as determined by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Active site titrated papain was then used to determine the active concentrations of eq d-1 as described previously (23Lenarčič B. Križaj I. Žunec P. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and that of equistatin as follows. Papain (final concentration, 0.1 μm) mixed with cathepsin D (final concentration, 0.115 μm) was incubated with increasing amounts of equistatin (final concentration, 0–0.2 μm) in 500 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 0.1m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. After 45 min of incubation at 25 °C, 500 μl of 100 μm Z-Phe-Arg p-nitroanilide was added, and the residual activity of papain was monitored as described previously (23Lenarčič B. Križaj I. Žunec P. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The kinetics of inhibition of papain were analyzed according to Ref. 13Lenarčič B. Ritonja A. Štrukelj B. Turk B. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13899-13903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar. All experiments were done under pseudo first order conditions with at least 10-fold molar excess of inhibitor. Papain activity was assayed in the presence of fluorogenic substrate Z-Phe-Arg 4-methyl-7-coumarylamide, and the release of product was monitored continuously at excitation and emission wavelengths of 370 and 460 nm, respectively, using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter. All progress curves were fitted by non-linear regression analysis to the integrated rate equation (24Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (492) Google Scholar): [P] = v s t +(v z −v s)(1 −e -kt)/k, where [P] presents the product concentration, v z andv s are the initial and the steady-state velocities, respectively, t is time, and k is the observed pseudo-first order rate constant. The second order rate constant k a was calculated from the slope of the plot k versus [I] (slope = k a [I]/(1 +S/K m) + k d. The dissociation rate constants, k a, were obtained from individual measurements k d =kv i /v z, and the equilibrium inhibition constant, K i, was calculated from K i=k d /k a.K m values of 65 μm were used for papain (25Zucker S. Buttle D.J. Nicklin J.H. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 828: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), 2 μm for cathepsin L (26Mason R.W. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and 150 μm for cathepsin B (27Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods. Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Equistatin was tested for inhibitory activity against papain, the aspartic proteinases cathepsin D, pepsin, chymosin, and HIV-PR and against serine proteinase, trypsin. It inhibits papain as previously shown (13Lenarčič B. Ritonja A. Štrukelj B. Turk B. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13899-13903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and also cathepsin D but not other proteinases. In addition, it has been reported that p41 fragment does not have any inhibitory effect on cathepsin D (15Bevec T. Stoka V. Pungerčič G. Dolenc I. Turk V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To check whether equistatin acts as a substrate for cathepsin D, we incubated both in different molar ratios for different periods of time and subjected the mixtures to reverse-phase HPLC system. No degradation products were observed (Fig.1 A). In contrast, equistatin was found to be a good substrate for trypsin, and this fact was used for the separation of the thyroglobulin type-1 domains by a limited proteolysis with β-trypsin. Two major peaks were obtained on reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1 B). The molecular weights, estimated by the SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, were about 7,000 and 14,000 (Fig. 2 A). N-terminal sequences of the fragments locate them in the sequence of the equistatin molecule as shown in Fig.3. Their sizes, determined by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2 A), are consistent with their being domains. The smaller fragment starts with the N terminus of the equistatin and therefore corresponds to the first domain (eq d-1). The larger fragment revealed two sequences, starting with Ala68 and Val152. The Lys67–Ala68 bond is positioned at the beginning of the second domain (Fig. 3). Equistatin as isolated is substantially nicked between Arg151 and Val152, but the fragments are linked by a disulfide bond. 2B. Lenarčič, unpublished observations. A narrow double band, visible on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A), suggests the presence of cleavage by trypsin very near to the C terminus. The fragment with N-terminal Ala68 thus represents the combined second and third domains, eq d-2,3 (Fig. 3).Figure 2Electrophoretic analyses of equistatin.

When cathepsin D was titrated with equistatin, 1 mol of the latter was also needed to saturate 1 mol of cathepsin D (Fig. 4 A). Even more, by titrating papain with intact equistatin in the presence of cathepsin D, we demonstrated that the two inhibitory activities of equistatin are structurally separate. The residual activities of both papain and cathepsin D are listed in TableI.Table IDemonstration of the physical independence of the binding sites of equistatin for papain and cathepsin DPapainHuman cathepsin DEquistatinInitial velocity (ΔA/Δt) papain activityInitial velocity (ΔA/Δt) cathepsin D activitynmnmnm10011500.141−0.115100115200.125100115410.09010011561.50.060100115820.027100115102.50.015−0.00531001151220.009100115163.50.006 Open table in a new tab To assign the inhibitory activities to individual domains of equistatin, a kinetic analysis of the inactivation of papain and cathepsin D was performed.

Using H-Pro-Thr-Glu-Phe-Phe(NO2)-Arg-Leu-OH as substrate means that 6.4 nm enzyme is the minimum concentration usable, so that the determination of subnanomolar K i values cannot be precisely determined. However, the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction between cathepsin D and equistatin (K i = 0.3 nm) indicates that equistatin is a strong inhibitor of cathepsin D (Fig. 4 B). For the papain active fragment, eq d-1, K i is >1 μm. This is at least several orders of magnitude higher than the K i value for intact equistatin, indicating that the inhibitory active site of the equistatin must be located on other domains. The eq d-2,3 domains exhibited the same inhibition characteristics as the whole equistatin molecule (K i= 0.4 nm). Additionally, the formation of a tight complex between cathepsin D and equistatin was demonstrated by native PAGE (Fig. 2 B) and confirmed by microsequence analysis. On SDS-PAGE without reduction, equistatin migrates as a single band with an M r of about 22,000 (Fig. 2 A), whereas under reducing conditions it showed single band with anM r of about 16,000 (13Lenarčič B. Ritonja A. Štrukelj B. Turk B. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13899-13903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). On the other hand, equistatin on native PAGE gives one major and one minor band, both having the same N-terminal sequence and molecular weight. The minor band probably reflects a molecule of equistatin differing slightly in covalent structure, e.g. glycosylation, amide content, etc. Equistatin showed no inhibitory activity against other aspartic proteinases, pepsin, chymosin, and HIV-PR, even at 2 μmconcentrations of inhibitor, thus showing a high degree of specificity for cathepsin D. Multiplication of inhibitory reactive sites has also occurred in several families of serine proteinase inhibitors (28van der Logt C.P.E. Reitsma P.H. Bertina R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 29: 1571-1577Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar, 30Bolander M.E. Young M.E. Fischer L.W. Yamada Y. Termine F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2919-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the case of kininogen, two (D2 and D3) of three cystatin-like domains can simultaneously inhibit papain-like cysteine proteinases (31Salvesen G. Parkes C. Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 32Turk B. Stoka V. Björk I. Boudier C. Johansson G. Dolenc I. Čolič A. Bieth J.G. Turk V. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1874-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The subtle differences between both domains have significant implications for protein interactions. The D2 domain is able to inhibit calpain, and this feature is unique among cystatins. The region responsible for the calpain inhibition is distinct from the inhibitory region for papain-like cysteine proteinases (33Bradford H.N. Jameson B.A. Adams A.A. Wassell R.P. Collman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26546-26551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another example is the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) family of proteins where two or three copies of the BIR (baculovirus IAP repeat) domain are present. Not all BIRs are equivalent in their ability to inhibit caspases (34Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Our results show clearly that the different thyroglobulin type-1 domains present in equistatin, despite their amino acid sequence similarity, can inhibit proteinases of different classes. The first domain inhibits the cysteine proteinases very strongly, and the second and/or third domains inhibit cathepsin D equally strongly. This is particularly clear in the case of equistatin, because this protein is composed only of thyroglobulin type-1 domains. One molecule of cathepsin D binds somewhere on eq d-2,3. The cleavage characterized above may result in a change in conformation and hence function. It is therefore not possible to say, from the properties of equistatin as isolated, whether the uncleaved C-terminal domain has inhibitory activity or not. Alternatively, if the cleavage has no effect on the structure of domain 3, it could be that domain 3 binds cathepsin D, in which case the results show that domain 2 would not. The resolution of the problem will require the production of individual domains by recombinant technology. Efforts to identify the targets of each of the individual thyroglobulin type-1 domains within thyropins and to understand the structural basis of their differential inhibition of proteinases will provide additional insights into the mechanisms by which thyropins regulate the proteolytic activity. We thank Dr. Selma Berbić, Dr. Lejla Begić-Odobašić, and Tina Lenassi for cathepsin D, Dr. Igor Križaj and Adrijana Leonardi for performing N-terminal sequences, and Dr. Roger Pain for helpful discussion and critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2016847790,"Hemopexin protects cells lacking hemopexin receptors by tightly binding heme abrogating its deleterious effects and preventing nonspecific heme uptake, whereas cells with hemopexin receptors undergo a series of cellular events upon encountering heme-hemopexin. The biochemical responses to heme-hemopexin depend on its extracellular concentration and range from stimulation of cell growth at low levels to cell survival at otherwise toxic levels of heme. High (2–10 μm) but not low (0.01–1 μm) concentrations of heme-hemopexin increase, albeit transiently, the protein carbonyl content of mouse hepatoma (Hepa) cells. This is due to events associated with heme transport since cobalt-protoporphyrin IX-hemopexin, which binds to the receptor and activates signaling pathways without tetrapyrrole transport, does not increase carbonyl content. The N-terminal c-Jun kinase (JNK) is rapidly activated by 2–10 μm heme-hemopexin, yet the increased intracellular heme levels are neither toxic nor apoptotic. After 24 h exposure to 10 μm heme-hemopexin, Hepa cells become refractory to the growth stimulation seen with 0.1–0.75 μm heme-hemopexin but HO-1 remains responsive to induction by heme-hemopexin. Since free heme does not induce JNK, the signaling events, like phosphorylation of c-Jun via activation of JNK as well as the nuclear translocation of NFκB, G2/M arrest, and increased expression of p53 and of the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 generated by heme-hemopexin appear to be of paramount importance in cellular protection by heme-hemopexin.

Generation of reactive oxygen species as well as radical reactions occur upon tissue and red blood cell damage and release of heme, for example, hydroxyl radical production by hemoglobin and myoglobin from hydrogen peroxide (1Paller M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F539-F544PubMed Google Scholar). Heme is considered to be one causative agent in organ failure after ischemia reperfusion since heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; heme, iron-protoporphyrin IX; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; CoPP, cobalt-protoporphyrin IX; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MT-1, metallothionein-1; PKC, protein kinase C; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; LSDMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FBS; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FBS, fetal bovine serum. is induced in heart and kidney (2Raju V.S. Maines M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 1814-1822PubMed Google Scholar). The forms of heme in the circulation which initially predominate after an injury are hemoglobin, heme-hemopexin, hemoglobin-haptoglobin, and heme-albumin (3Smith A. Dailey Jr., H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw Hill, Inc., New York1990: 435-489Google Scholar). Haptoglobin does not recycle and is readily depleted, and heme rapidly transfers to hemopexin from heme-albumin (4Morgan W.T. Deaciuc V. Riehm J.P. J. Mol. Recognit. 1989; 2: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and from deoxyhemoglobin in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (5Miller Y.I. Smith A. Morgan W.T. Shaklai N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13112-13117Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hemopexin, because of its avidity for heme (K d <1 pm; Ref. 6Hrkal Z. Vodrazka Z. Kalousek I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 43: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), has a protective role in hemolysis, trauma, and ischemia reperfusion and is in the first line of defense against heme-mediated oxidative damage (7Gutteridge J.M. Smith A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 8Vincent S.H. Grady R.W. Shaklai N. Snider J.M. Muller-Eberhard U. Arch. Biochem.

Hemopexin binds heme in a low spin complex, thereby decreasing heme's peroxidative activity, and transports it via endocytosis into cells expressing hemopexin receptors (10Smith A. Hunt R.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 234-245PubMed Google Scholar, 11Taketani S. Kohno H. Tokunaga R. Biochem. Int. 1986; 13: 307-312PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, hemopexin is resistant to depletion since it recycles after heme delivery (12Smith A. Hunt R.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 234-245PubMed Google Scholar, 13Smith A. Morgan W.T. Biochem. J. 1979; 182: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Smith A. Morgan W.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 84: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and remains in circulation to protect against heme-stimulated peroxidation. On the other hand, while hemopexin (about 10–20 μm in plasma) is protective extracellularly, the increase in intracellular heme and iron consequent to hemopexin-mediated transport might increase the intracellular oxidation state and possibly lead to biochemical responses to prevent oxidative damage to cell constituents. However, the induction of HO-1 by heme-hemopexin (15Alam J. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16379-16384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by hypoxia ischemia (16Bergeron M. Ferriero D.M. Vreman H.J. Stevenson D.K. Sharp F.R. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), cytokines, and hydrogen peroxide (17Terry C.M. Clikeman J.A. Hoidal J.R. Callahan K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H883-H891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is considered to be protective for cells, since the heme catabolites biliverdin and bilirubin are anti-oxidants in vitro (18Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 663: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In addition, iron sequestration by ferritin protects cells against the toxic effects of iron released by heme oxygenase, and hemopexin induces ferritin (9Hunt R.C. Hunt D.M. Gaur N. Smith A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the gene expression of metallothionein-1 (MT-1) is also induced by heme-hemopexin (15Alam J. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16379-16384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in part by activation of signaling pathways (19Smith A. Alam J. Escriba P.V. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7365-7371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ren Y. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23988-23995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We proposed (20Ren Y. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23988-23995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that MT induction helps the cells to maintain homeostasis as intracellular heme and iron levels increase since the sulfhydryl-rich MT protects against radicals (21Chubatsu L.S. Meneghini R. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and also sequesters zinc, which might otherwise occupy iron sulfur protein active sites as well as copper, which is redox active. MT functions normally in copper (22Kelly E.J. Palmiter R.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and zinc homeostasis (23Fischer E.H. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3333-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but recent studies with MT-null mice support the role in oxidative stress conditions (24Zheng H. Liu J. Liu Y. Klaassen C.D. Toxicol. Lett. 1996; 87: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Heme-hemopexin targets heme to a discrete set of tissues and cells via selective expression of the hemopexin receptor and protects receptor null cells, including endothelial cells lining blood vessels, by preventing diffusion of free heme. Receptors for heme-hemopexin are expressed by liver parenchymal cells (25Smith A. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12049-12053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lymphocytes (26Smith A. Eskew J.D. Borza C.M. Pendrak M. Hunt R.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and cells of barrier tissues, e.g. retinal pigment epithelia (9Hunt R.C. Hunt D.M. Gaur N. Smith A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and probably also neurons of the peripheral (27Madore N. Sagot Y. Guinaudy M.J. Cochard P. Swerts J.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and central nervous systems (28Morris C.M. Candy J.M. Edwardson J.A. Bloxham C.A. Smith A. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 149: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Heme-hemopexin has also recently been shown to act as a growth factor by providing a source of nutrient iron and activating PKC in human T-lymphocytes (26Smith A. Eskew J.D. Borza C.M. Pendrak M. Hunt R.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As with other growth factors, the growth response curve is bell-shaped, raising the possibility that high levels of transported heme are deleterious to the cells or even toxic, although heme-hemopexin induces HO-1 and ferritin (9Hunt R.C. Hunt D.M. Gaur N. Smith A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Alam J. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16379-16384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the heme-iron is rapidly incorporated into ferritin (29Davies D.M. Smith A. Muller-Eberhard U. Morgan W.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1504-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If the heme handling system is overloaded, heme can participate in intracellular oxygen radical reactions that lead to the degradation of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and DNA (30Aft R.L. Mueller G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 301-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address the cellular and biochemical consequences of increasing intracellular heme via the specific hemopexin receptor, we investigated the effects of nanomolar to micromolar levels of heme-hemopexin on the cellular oxidation state as well as on cell growth and activation of signaling cascades known to respond to growth factors and stress that ultimately activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members. Here, the focus is on the N-terminal c-Jun kinase (JNK), also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), one member of the MAPK family activated by exposure of cells to UV radiation, heat shock, or inflammatory cytokines. Other members include extracellular signal regulated kinase, which responds to binding of growth factors to receptor tyrosine kinases via Ras, and p38 kinase (reactivating kinase or MAP2), which is activated in response to inflammatory cytokines, endotoxins, and osmotic stress (reviewed in Ref. 31Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). These kinases play key roles in determining cellular responses to many extracellular stimuli which activate small G-proteins such as Rho, Rac, and Ras which in turn stimulate MAPK kinase cascades and lead to the phosphorylation of transcription factors to produce a unique, appropriate transcriptional activity for a particular external stress. We report here additional evidence for the pleiotropic protective effects of heme-hemopexin, particularly in increasing cell survival under heme stress and generating high levels of a DNA-binding form of two transcription factors, c-Jun and NFκB. Metalloporphyrin (Porphyrin Products, Logan, UT) concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically in dimethyl sulfoxide using published procedures (19Smith A. Alam J. Escriba P.V. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7365-7371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Camptothecin and hydroxyurea were obtained from Sigma; doxorubicin from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); and dinitrophenyl hydrazine and guanidine from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Commercial antibodies to bcl-2 were obtained from Oncogene Research Products and Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Intact rabbit hemopexin was purified and stoichiometric 1:1 heme-hemopexin complexes (>90–95% saturated) characterized and quantitated as described previously (19Smith A. Alam J. Escriba P.V. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7365-7371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Morgan W.T. Muster P. Tatum F. Kao S. Alam J. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6256-6262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) keeping the Me2SO concentration less than 5% (v/v), and using extinction coefficients (A·m−1·cm−1) of 1.1 × 105 at 280 nm for apo-hemopexin; 1.2 × 105 at 280 nm and 1.3 × 105 at 405 nm for rabbit mesoheme-hemopexin. Cobalt-protoporphyrin IX-hemopexin complexes were similarly made using published extinction coefficients (19Smith A. Alam J. Escriba P.V. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7365-7371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and all hemopexin complexes were dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C before use. Mouse hepatoma cells (Hepa) were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 5% FBS as described (33Smith A. Ledford B.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For growth studies, cells seeded at an initial density of 2000 cells per well in 96-well plates were synchronized by incubation in DMEM containing 0.5% serum (LSDMEM) for 16 h before addition of increasing concentrations of sterilized (0.2-μm nylon) heme-hemopexin. Cell number was assessed using the Promega Cell Titer proliferation assay as described previously for MOLT-3 cells (26Smith A. Eskew J.D. Borza C.M. Pendrak M. Hunt R.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Initial experiments using direct cell counting confirmed the accuracy of this method under the experimental conditions investigated. Although liver cells are differentiated and not actively dividing, mouse Hepa cells were used because they have well characterized responses to heme-hemopexin (15Alam J. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16379-16384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Smith A. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12049-12053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are models for replicating cells with liver-specific functions like interleukin-6 responsiveness 2A. Smith, unpublished observations. and plasma protein synthesis (34Ledford B.E. Davis D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3304-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepa cells were synchronized by incubation in low serum medium for 16 h after seeding (2 × 106 cells per T75 flask) in normal culture medium and attachment during 5 h incubation. Then the medium was changed to LSDMEM containing heme-hemopexin or the DNA intercalator, doxorubicin (0.2 μg/ml), or the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, hydroxyurea (10 mm), which were used to induce G2/M and G1/G0 arrest, respectively. After 3, 8, 24, and 48 h cells were fixed and the DNA stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) containing RNase (60 μg/ml). The amount of DNA was measured using Immunocount II with an Orthocytronabsolute flow cytometer (Orthodiagnostics, Raritan, NJ) and the data analyzed and correlated with changes in the cell cycle using Modfit (Verity House Software, Topsham, ME). After the usual subculture and synchronization, cells (6 × 106 cells per T-75) were incubated for up to 2 h in the presence or absence of 2–10 μm heme-hemopexin, 2–10 μm CoPP-hemopexin, 0.5–10 μm free heme, or 400 μm hydrogen peroxide (stock concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 43.6 m−1 cm−1 at 240 nm). The cellular carbonyl content of oxidatively modified proteins in cell extracts was determined using a published protocol (35Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar) and contaminating nucleic acids were removed from the cell extracts (1 mg of protein) by precipitation upon addition of streptomycin sulfate (1% w/v). Proteins were recovered by precipitation and the protein carbonyl content of the final washed pellet, dissolved in 6 mguanidine-HCl, pH 2.3 (600 μl), was calculated from the maximum absorbance (360–390 nm) using a molar absorbance coefficient of 22 mm−1 cm−1. To minimize variation, the amount of protein recovered in the final pellet after solubilization in 6 m guanidine was quantitated using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and the carbonyl content of cell samples expressed per mg of protein. Forty eight hours after seeding (4 × 106 cells/T150 flask) Hepa cells were rinsed and incubated for 1 h in serum-free HEPES-buffered DMEM, pH 7.4, supplemented with heme-hemopexin (50 nm to 10 μm). Nuclear extracts were then prepared from these cells essentially as described previously for HeLa cells (36Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out using a 4% (80:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) polyacrylamide gel after incubation of nuclear extracts (3 μg) for 20 min at room temperature with 0.035 pmol of an radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe encoding a consensus sequence for the transcription factor NFκB (Promega, WI). The oligonucleotides were radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) and [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products Inc., specific activity 10 μCi/μl). The identity of the specific NFκB·DNA complex was confirmed by separate competition studies with 50 m excess of the unlabeled NFκB consensus oligonucleotide (AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC from Promega, Madison, WI) as well as by supershift assays using a rabbit polyclonal anti-p65 NFκB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Synchronized Hepa cells (seeded at 1.3 × 106 cells per T-75 flask) were incubated in LSDMEM for up to 6 h in the presence of 1–10 μm heme-hemopexin, 2–10 μm CoPP-hemopexin, or 0.4–10 μm free heme and cell extracts prepared using Tris-Triton X-100 buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm sodium vanadate (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) as phosphatase inhibitor. Using c-Jun-glutathione S-transferase bound to Sepharose (2 μg) as substrate, the amount of activated JNK/SAPK in cell extracts (1 mg of protein) was estimated using an in vitro kinase assay (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) followed by quantitation of phospho-c-Jun-glutathione S-transferase produced by Western analysis using a polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) antibody followed by detection using ECL (Amersham) and quantitation using the NIH Image program. Due to the low abundance of p53, Hepa cells were first treated with doxorubicin (0.2 μg/ml) for 48 h to induce p53 expression. Cell lysates were prepared in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS with 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin (PBS-TDS buffer) and after preclearing by incubation with 1 μg of mouse IgG and “protein G-plus-agarose,” p53 was recovered by incubating the lysates with 1 μg of antibodies to wild type and mutant p53 (Ab-4 and Ab-3, respectively; Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA). The antibody-bound p53 was recovered by addition of protein G-plus-agarose and detected by Western analysis after SDS-PAGE using as primary antibody Pantropic Ab-7 to p53 (diluted 1:2500) followed by detection using biotinylated rabbit anti-sheep IgG and streptavidin horseradish peroxidase with the ECL system and quantitated as described above. After the usual subculture and synchronization, Hepa cells (seeded at 1.3 × 106 per T75) were then incubated in LSDMEM in the presence or absence of 10 μm heme-hemopexin for 21 h. Cell extracts were prepared from washed cells by solubilization in Laemmli buffer and sonication, and PARP detected after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of cell extracts (equivalent to 1 × 105 cells) and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) using monoclonal antibodies (diluted 1:10,000) which recognize both the intact protein and the 86-kDa proteolytic fragment (C2-10 from Dr. Guy Poirier, Research Center of the Central Hospital of Laval University, Quebec, Canada) were detected with donkey anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase and carried out as usual with the ECL system. Cleaved PARP present in extracts of ectoposide (VP16)-treated HL-60 cells (also from Dr. Guy Pourier) was used as a marker. After the usual subculture and synchronization, Hepa cells (seeded at 1.3 × 106 per T75) were then incubated in LSDMEM in the presence or absence of heme-hemopexin or doxorubicin at various times and concentrations given in the figure legends. Cell extracts were prepared from washed cells by solubilization in PBS-TDS buffer and p21WAF1/CIP/SDI1 detected after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of cell extracts (25 μg of protein) and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Anti-murine p21 antibodies (Ab-5 from Oncogene Research Products) were detected using donkey anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase and the ECL system. To establish whether events associated with receptor binding and hemopexin-mediated heme transport increase the intracellular oxidation state, the production of protein carbonyls was measured after incubation of Hepa cells with heme-hemopexin. Concentrations in the range 2–10 μm represent a “heme load” at sites of localized trauma injury since circulating plasma hemopexin levels are approximately 20 μm. Within 15 min, 10 μm heme-hemopexin doubled the cell carbonyl content to about 7 nmol/mg of protein, equivalent to the level produced in response to 400 μm H2O2 (Fig.1 A). This effect of heme-hemopexin is dose-dependent from 2 to 10 μm (Fig. 1 B) and transient since carbonyl levels declined after 30 min. As expected, free heme also rapidly increased carbonyl content (Fig. 1 C). The nuclear concentration of NFκB is induced by extracellular hydrogen peroxide, cell damage, and growth arrest (37Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 63-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Within 1 h, heme-hemopexin (2–10 μm) induces NFκB DNA binding approximately 5–7-fold as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 1 D). Identification of NFκB was confirmed by the supershift of the radiolabeled DNA-protein complexes in the presence of an antibody to the p65 subunit of NFκB (Fig. 1 D, lane 6) and by specific competition with a non-radiolabeled oligonucleotide encoding an NFκB consensus binding site (Fig. 1 D, lane 8). Low levels of heme-hemopexin (i.e. 0.01–1 μm), which stimulate cell growth in MOLT-3 cells (26Smith A. Eskew J.D. Borza C.M. Pendrak M. Hunt R.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and in Hepa cells (see below), do not detectably increase the DNA binding of NFκB. As a third parameter for the increased oxidation state we investigated whether heme-hemopexin activated JNK/SAPK, known to respond to a variety of stresses including DNA damage, heat shock, or tumor necrosis factor β. Exposure of cells to 2–10 μm heme-hemopexin caused extensive activation of JNK/SAPK within 30 min, which continues to increase for 1 h (Fig. 2). The extent of JNK/SAPK activation is proportional to the extracellular concentration of heme-hemopexin (Fig. 2 B). JNK/SAPK activity exhibits a biphasic response: declining by 3 h but increasing again by 6 h. Phospho-c-Jun levels are maintained for at least 6 h, with a small decline at 3 h (Fig. 2 A) and there is no apparent change in the amount of total c-Jun, as determined by Western analysis, over this time (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). Hepa cells express relatively abundant, high affinity receptors for hemopexin (25Smith A. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12049-12053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and proliferate normally using 0.05 to 1 μm heme-hemopexin as the sole iron source (Fig.3 A), as previously reported for human lymphocytes (MOLT-3 cells) and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes (26Smith A. Eskew J.D. Borza C.M. Pendrak M. Hunt R.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of higher concentrations of heme-hemopexin (2–10 μm), cell growth was arrested. Stimulation of cell growth was equivalent for cells of either low (passage 39; data not shown) or high (passage 99; Fig. 3 A) passage number, and there was no loss of viability as judged by trypan blue staining in cells exposed to 10 μm heme-hemopexin (data not shown). Heme-hemopexin also overcame the growth inhibition by the permeable iron chelator, desferroxamine (Fig. 3 B), as previously reported for MOLT-3 cells (26Smith A. Eskew J.D. Borza C.M. Pendrak M. Hunt R.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), further substantiating that the iron released by heme catabolism was used for cell growth. When, after an initial 24-h period, the culture medium containing 10 μm heme-hemopexin is removed and replaced with fresh medium lacking heme-hemopexin but containing FBS, cell growth resumes and 24 h later cell number is increased in proportion to the FBS concentration (Fig.4 A). After 24 h incubation in the presence of 10 μm extracellular levels of heme-hemopexin, the cells are refractory to a previously stimulatory concentration of heme hemopexin (0.1 μm, see Fig.4 B; 0.5 and 0.75 μm (data not shown)) but are neither dead nor undergoing apoptosis. This was confirmed by examining whether cleavage of PARP by activated caspases was occurring (38Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). There was no detectable PARP cleavage after 21 (Fig. 4 C) or 48 h (data not shown) exposure of the cells to 10 μmheme-hemopexin. As a positive control, the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, was shown to induce apoptosis in Hepa cells, producing typical morphological changes within 3 h (data not shown). The expected reduction in volume of cytoplasm and release of vesicles without cell lysis as well as cleavage of PARP were apparent at 21 h. Thus, cell arrest, not apoptosis nor necrosis, occurs at heme-hemopexin concentrations greater than 1 μm. Although cells treated with 10 μm heme-hemopexin are arrested for a time, they do retain hemopexin receptors and remain responsive to other biological consequences of heme-hemopexin. In particular, HO-1 protein is induced within 3 h by 10 μm heme-hemopexin, and increases for at least the next 4 h before declining to basal levels at 20 h (data not shown). A second exposure to heme-hemopexin 20 h after the first induces HO-1 again and to a similar extent over time. Taken together, these observations show that cell cycle regulation has taken place with no obvious loss of hemopexin receptors at the cell surface or ability to induce HO-1 and catabolize heme. Since the tumor suppressor gene product, p53, increases in response to DNA damage (39Wu Y. Huang H. Miner Z. Kulesz-Martin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8982-8987Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and since many transformed cell lines express mutant forms of p53, we investigated whether Hepa cells express wild type p53, and whether changes in p53 expression occur in response to high extracellular levels of heme-hemopexin. Immunoprecipitation studies reveal that Hepa cells express wild type p53, which is induced by the DNA intercalator, doxorubicin (data not shown). When cells are grown for 48 h in medium containing low levels of serum, p53 expression is also induced by high levels of heme-hemopexin, but a growth stimulating concentration (0.5 μm) of heme-hemopexin consistently causes a 50–60% decrease in immunodetectable p53 (data not shown). Heme-hemopexin increases the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1, as assessed with two different protocols, and prevents apoptosis due to withdrawal of serum factors (Fig. 5). Somewhat unexpectedly, using a protocol for induction of apoptosis by staurosporine in a p53-null lung cancer cell line (40Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc."
https://openalex.org/W2091643513,"Basal cell adhesion molecule (B-CAM) and Lutheran (LU) are two spliceoforms of a single immunoglobulin superfamily protein containing five Ig domains and comprise the sickle (SS) red cell receptor for laminin. We have now analyzed laminin binding to murine erythroleukemia cells transfected with various human B-CAM/LU constructs. B-CAM and LU bound equally well to laminin, indicating that the longer cytoplasmic tail of LU is not required for binding. However, binding of soluble laminin did require the presence of the membrane-proximal fifth immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domain of LU, while deletion of IgSF domains 1, 2, 3, or 4 individually or together did not abrogate laminin binding. Under flow conditions, MEL cells expressing B-CAM, LU, and LU lacking domains 1, 2, 3, or 4 adhered to immobilized laminin with critical shear stresses over 10 dynes/cm2. However, MEL cells expressing LU lacking domain 5 bound to laminin poorly (critical shear stress = 2.3 dynes/cm2). Moreover, expression of only IgSF domain 5 of LU was sufficient to mediate MEL cell adhesion to immobilized laminin (critical shear stress >10 dynes/cm2). Finally, Scatchard analysis showed that SS red cells had an average of 67% more B-CAM/LU than normal red cells, and low density red cells from sickle cell disease patients expressed 40–55% more B-CAM/LU than high density SS red cells. B-CAM/LU copy number thus may also play a role in the abnormal adhesion of SS red cells to laminin.

Vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease patients is a complex process involving not only the mechanical obstruction of vessels by misshapen and nondeformable sickle (SS) 1The abbreviations used are: SS, homozygous for sickle hemoglobin; B-CAM, basal cell adhesion molecule; LU, Lutheran glycoprotein; MEL, murine erythroleukemia; IgSF, immunoglobulin superfamily; Ab, antibody; mAb, murine monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MFC, mean fluorescence channel; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ALCAM, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (CD166). 1The abbreviations used are: SS, homozygous for sickle hemoglobin; B-CAM, basal cell adhesion molecule; LU, Lutheran glycoprotein; MEL, murine erythroleukemia; IgSF, immunoglobulin superfamily; Ab, antibody; mAb, murine monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MFC, mean fluorescence channel; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ALCAM, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (CD166). red cells but also cellular adhesion and the activation of coagulation (1$$Google Scholar). In addition, sickle cell disease is characterized by endothelial damage, some of which may result from the effects of a variety of cytokines on endothelial cells, resulting in increased circulating endothelial cells and, potentially, exposure of subendothelial matrix to flowing blood (2Sowemimo-Coker S.O. Meiselman H.J. Francis Jr., R.B. Am. J. Hematol. 1989; 31: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Hebbel R. Solovey A. Lin Y. Gui L. Key N. Browne P. Sickle Cell Disease in the 21st Century: National Sickle Cell Disease Conference, Washington, D. C., September 15–20, 1997. 1997; : 109Google Scholar). Among the subendothelial matrix molecules to which SS cells adhere, laminin is the one to which these cells adhere most avidly (4Hillery C.A. Du M.C. Montgomery R.R. Scott J.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 4879-4886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Laminin is a family of at least 11 heterotrimeric proteins, each containing an α, β, and γ subunit (5Engvall E. Wewer U.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that basal cell adhesion molecule/Lutheran glycoprotein (B-CAM/LU), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily with two known isomers (B-CAM and LU), is the major laminin receptor on SS red cells and promotes SS but not normal red cell adhesion to immobilized as well as soluble laminin (6Udani M. Zen Q. Cottman M. Leonard N. Jefferson S. Daymont C. Truskey G. Telen M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Expression of B-CAM/LU appeared to be increased on SS red cells, as measured by flow cytometry, and the level of B-CAM/LU expression was proportional to laminin binding among red cells from both normal donors and individuals with sickle cell disease (6Udani M. Zen Q. Cottman M. Leonard N. Jefferson S. Daymont C. Truskey G. Telen M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, the exact scale of increased expression was not determined in that study. The role of B-CAM/LU in adhesion to laminin was further supported by the binding of transfected MEL cells expressing recombinant human B-CAM (rB-CAM) to both soluble and immobilized laminin. B-CAM was first described as an IgSF protein expressed along the basal surface of epithelial cells (7Campbell I.G. Foulkes W.D. Senger G. Trowsdale J. Garin-Chesa P. Rettig W.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5761-5765PubMed Google Scholar). Later, Lutheran (LU) protein was characterized as a spliceoform of B-CAM (8Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5496-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Rahuel C. Le Van Kim C. Mattei M.G. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular portions of B-CAM and LU are identical and contain five IgSF domains: two variable-type, or V, domains and three constant-type 2, or C2, domains (Fig. 1 A). B-CAM differs from LU in that it lacks the last 40 amino acids, including a putative SH3 binding site, of the cytoplasmic tail and thus has a molecular mass of about 78 kDa, compared with a mass of 85 kDa for LU. Both proteins are expressed by normal and SS red cells. Other IgSF proteins have also been identified as laminin receptors, including members of the integrin subfamily (10Kramer R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mercurio A.M. Shaw L.M. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 169-173Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, no consensus motif for laminin binding has been identified, possibly because different laminin receptors bind to different sites and different isoforms of laminin. Previous studies of IgSF domain activity in cell adhesion involving other ligands have identified the N-terminal IgSF domain as the most frequent major binding domain, as in ICAM-1/LFA-1 and ICAM-3/LFA-1 interactions (13Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 14Klickstein L.B. York M.R. de Fougerolles A.R. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23920-23927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The N-terminal IgSF domain of ALCAM, which has two V and three C2 domains similar to B-CAM/LU, also mediates ALCAM's interaction with CD6 (15Bowen M.A. Bajorath J. D'Egidio M. Whitney G.G. Palmer D. Kobarg J. Atarling G.C. Siadak A.W. Aruffo A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1469-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In some cases, the second IgSF domain plays a less critical but important role (16Karecla P.I. Green S.J. Bowden S. Coadwel J. Kilshaw P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30909-30915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Newham P. Craig S.E. Seddon G.N. Schofield N.R. Rees A. Edwards R.M. Jones E.Y. Humphries M.J. J.

And in other instances, such as in the interactions of CD4 with major histocompatibility complex II and CD8 with major histocompatibility complex I, multiple IgSF domains are involved (18Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 19Moebius U. Pallai P. Harrison S.C.

In the present study of B-CAM/LU, we have measured the B-CAM/LU copy number on SS and normal red cells, as well as on density fractionated SS red cells, in order to determine if increased expression of B-CAM/LU is likely to be a factor in the observed increased adhesion of SS red cells to laminin. We have also used a number of recombinant LU proteins from which various IgSF domains have been deleted to demonstrate that the membrane proximal IgSF domain (domain 5) alone is critical for laminin binding, and that the cytoplasmic tail of LU, which is absent from B-CAM, does not appear to affect laminin binding. The MEL cell line was obtained from Dr. B. Haynes, Duke University Medical Center, and maintained under standard tissue culture conditions in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. The anti-Lub mAb LM342/767:31 was produced by Dr. Robin Fraser, Glasgow and West Scotland Blood Transfusion Service, UK. mAb 4F2 was generated by immunizing a mouse with MEL cells expressing rB-CAM and rLU and recognizes the fifth IgSF domain of B-CAM/LU. 2M. Lacaze, Q. Zen, and M. Telen, unpublished data. Human anti-Lu8, which recognizes an epitope on the second IgSF domain of B-CAM/LU (20Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Daniels G.L. Green C.A. Smythe J.S. Anstee D.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was provided by the Immunohematology Laboratory of the Duke University Medical Center Transfusion Service. Rabbit anti-human laminin was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibodies and FITC-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Purified anti-Lub mAb was radiolabeled with 1.0 mCi of Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per 1.0 mg of protein, using glass tubes coated with IODO-GEN (Pierce) (21Telen M.J. Palker T.J. Haynes B.F. Blood. 1984; 64: 599-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The iodinated mAb was separated from free Na125I by repeated dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline, resulting in mAb with a specific activity of 0.3–0.5 μCi/μg of protein, with >99% of the radioactivity precipitable by cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Aliquots (100 μl) of serially diluted radiolabeled mAb with concentrations ranging from 30 ng/ml to 60 μg/ml were added to equal volumes of red cells suspended at 2 × 108/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 1 g/dl bovine serum albumin, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Red cells used were all homozygous Lu(a−b+), according to routine typing performed in the Duke Hospital Transfusion Service. In order to determine nonspecific binding, inhibition of the binding of 125I-mAb to red cells was achieved by incubating the cells with 50 m excess of unlabeled mAb prior to adding 125I-mAb. Quantitation of antigen sites per cell was calculated as described elsewhere (22Lowenthal J.W. Coethesy P. Tougne C. Lees R. MacDonald H.R. Nabholz M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3988-3994PubMed Google Scholar, 23Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17789) Google Scholar), with the assumption that each antigen site was capable of binding one Ig molecule. In order to separate low density (reticulocyte-enriched) and high density (older) red cells, a variable density solution composed of low, intermediate, and high density arabinogalactan layers was prepared according to the manufacturer's directions (Cellsep Protocol, Larex Inc., St. Paul, MN). These layers had densities of 1.085, 1.090, and 1.095 g/ml, respectively. One ml of packed SS red cells was carefully laid on the top of the density solution without disturbing the layers, and the tube was then centrifuged for 45 min at 50,000 ×g at room temperature. This procedure resulted in separation of red blood cells into three distinct bands; the top and bottom layers of cells were extracted and used as the low and high density cells, respectively. A partial human LU cDNA was provided by D. Anstee (International Blood Group Reference Laboratory, Bristol, UK) and expanded to include the entire coding region or modified to replicate the previously described B-CAM cDNA by PCR. This construct was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which was used for all studies involving expression of recombinant proteins. A complete LU cDNA constructed and inserted into the pcDNA3.1(−) vector as described above was used as the template for all further PCR reactions to create constructs encoding domain deletion mutants. The cDNA sequences encoding each IgSF domain were deleted individually from the full-length LU cDNA using deletional oligonucleotide primers in overlapping extension PCR (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Norton R.M. Pullen L.R. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar). The forward primers used to produce the 3′ cDNA fragments of each construct are listed in Table I. Complementary reverse oligonucleotide primers were utilized to generate the 5′ fragments of each construct. A first round of PCR reactions was performed using one of the deletional oligonucleotide primers (forward or reverse sense) and a corresponding vector primer under the following cycling conditions: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 3 min; 4 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min; and finally, 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. The two overlapping cDNA fragments were then used to prime each other for 4 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 66 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min). The 5′ and 3′ vector primers were then added to the PCR reactions to amplify the entire mutagenized cDNA, and PCR was performed as follows: 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min; and 1 more cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. A LU construct containing only domain 5 (LU5) without domains 1–4 was also generated using the same PCR method and primers as listed in Table I. The amino acids expressed by each LU deletion construct are also listed in Table I, and the structure of all constructs used is illustrated in Fig. 2 A.Table IConstruction of Lutheran Proteins with IgSF Domain DeletionsConstructDeletional oligonucleotide (forward sense)Resulting protein structureLUΔ1GATGCCCAGGCGGAGAAGCCAGAGGCCACTMet1–Glu32, Lys146–Cys628LUΔ2AAGCCAGAGGCCACTCTCACCCTGCACTATMet1–Thr150, Leu258–Cys628LUΔ3CTCACCCTGCACTATGTGGCCTATCTGGACMet1–Thy262, Val358–Cys628LUΔ4GCCTATCTGGACCCCCAAGGCTCGCCAGAGCTMet1–Pro363, Gln445–Cys628LUΔ5CGCCAGAGCTAAAGACACAGACCTCCCAGGMet1–Thr452, Gln543–Cys628LU5GATGCCCAGGCGGAGCAAGGCTCGCCAGAGMet1–Glu32, Gln445–Cys628 Open table in a new tab All cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(−) expression vector; restriction mapping and DNA sequencing confirmed that the vectors contained the desired constructs with deletions, and constructs were transfected into MEL cells by electroporation, as described previously (6Udani M.

Transfected cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells with strong expression of recombinant protein were further selected by immunofluorescence-activated cell sorting. MEL cells (107/ml) transfected with LUΔ2, LUΔ3, LUΔ4, or LUΔ5 constructs and grown for >2 weeks in medium containing Geneticin were incubated with anti-Lub mAb at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 1 g/dl bovine serum albumin, and incubation with FITC-linked secondary Ab, and repeated washing. MEL cells expressing LUΔ1 were incubated with human anti-Lu8. MEL/LU5 cells were incubated with mAb 4F2. Transfectants expressing high levels of desired proteins were selected by sterile sorting using a Becton Dickinson FACStar Plus at Duke University Cancer Center. Stably transfected MEL cells were assayed for their ability to bind soluble laminin by incubation with 3 μg/ml human laminin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by staining with rabbit anti-laminin and FITC-conjugated secondary Ab, as described previously (6Udani M. Zen Q. Cottman M. Leonard N. Jefferson S. Daymont C. Truskey G. Telen M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis of soluble laminin binding was performed on an Orthocytoron Absolute flow cytometer (Ortho Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Raritan, NJ). Each transfected cell line was tested for its ability to bind laminin a minimum of three times, and data shown are representative of the results obtained. Red cell membrane proteins were prepared as previous described (21Telen M.J. Palker T.J. Haynes B.F.

MEL cell transfectants were lysed in Tris-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). All membrane protein lysates were boiled in non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. Five μg of SS red cell membrane proteins and 10 μg of MEL transfectant membrane lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). A combination of mAbs 4F2 and anti-Lub was used as primary antibody, since no single antibody recognized all the LU deletion mutants expressed. Blots were developed using the ECL system according to manufacturer's directions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Studies of intact cell adhesion to immobilized laminin were performed using a flow chamber system in which a graduated chamber height allowed variable shear stresses to be produced along the length of a single slide, as described previously (6Udani M. Zen Q. Cottman M. Leonard N. Jefferson S. Daymont C. Truskey G. Telen M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In brief, 3 μg/ml human placental laminin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was coated onto a glass slide, which was then mounted into the flow chamber. Following a 15-min static incubation with MEL cell transfectants containing a LU construct or vector only and quantification of cells in each of seven fields along the length of the slide, flow was applied at 20 ml/min for 6 min. After flow, the adherent cells were again counted at the same seven areas of the slide, corresponding to shear stresses ranging from 0.2 to 10 dynes/cm2. Results were calculated as the percentage of cells adherent after flow, compared with the number of cells initially seen in each field after the static adherence phase. Critical shear stress is defined as the shear stress at which 50% of the cells become detached. Each transfected cell line was examined at least twice, with concordant results, by this method. As previous results have suggested that the B-CAM/LU proteins are overexpressed by SS red cells (6Udani M. Zen Q. Cottman M. Leonard N. Jefferson S. Daymont C. Truskey G. Telen M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 28El Nemer W. Gane P. Colin Y. Bony V. Rahuel C. Galacteros F. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. J. Biol.

Red cells from six randomly selected normal blood donors expressed 1550, 1750, 1800, 1820, 1900, and 1970 molecules of B-CAM/LU per cell, with an average of 1798 ± 144 molecules per cell. The red cells from six patients with sickle cell anemia expressed 2500, 2600, 2700, 2980, 3080, and 4300 molecules of B-CAM/LU per cell, with an average copy number per cell of 3027 ± 662 (p < 0.005 compared with red cells from normal donors). Thus, on average, SS red cells expressed about two-thirds more B-CAM/LU molecules than did normal red cells. Similar studies using density fractionated red cells were also performed on red cells from four sickle cell disease patients (TableII) selected to represent a range of B-CAM/LU copy numbers per cell. Although the copy number of B-CAM/LU per cell for low density red cells enriched in reticulocytes was about 40–55% more than that seen in the high density fraction, the B-CAM/LU copy number of unfractionated SS red cells was only 2–9% more than that of the high density fraction (Table II), demonstrating that the presence of reticulocytes with higher numbers of B-CAM/LU molecules per cell affected the overall expression of B-CAM/LU by circulating red cells very little. Furthermore, the binding affinities of the radiolabeled anti-Lub mAb to B-CAM/LU on normal and SS red cells varied only slightly among red cells donors. The range of dissociation constants (K d) observed was 1.0–5.6 pm. In addition, the antibody also showed similar affinities when reacted with high, low, and unfractionated SS cells (data not shown), suggesting that the conformation of the B-CAM/LU Lub antigen was similar among cells of different ages.Table IICopy number of B-CAM/LU on density-fractionated and unfractionated SS red cellsMolecules B-CAM/LU per SS red cellUnfractionatedHigh densityLow densityPatient 1322031504600Patient 2303027704400Patient 3330031505120Patient 4217020002800 Open table in a new tab In order to determine whether the presence or absence of the cytoplasmic tail lacking from B-CAM affects laminin binding, stably transfected MEL cells expressing B-CAM or LU were tested for their ability to bind soluble laminin by flow cytometric assay (Fig.1 B). Recombinant B-CAM and LU proteins were easily detected by anti-Lub on the transfectants containing B-CAM or LU cDNAs, but not on cells containing vector alone. Likewise, soluble laminin bound equally well to both B-CAM and LU transfectants but not to the cells transfected with vector alone. This indicates that the cytoplasmic region has little or no effect on laminin binding. To determine the domain of B-CAM/LU that contributes to laminin binding, we expressed cDNA constructs containing LU cDNA from which had been deleted individual regions encoding each of the five IgSF domains (Fig. 2 A). Stably transfected MEL cells expressing these constructs were then examined by immunoblot with anti-Lub and 4F2 (anti-domain 5) mAbs (Fig.2 B). These studies demonstrated double protein bands arising from expression of all the Lutheran deletion constructs expressed in MEL cells; in each case, the lower band was 62–70 kDa and the higher band was 75–85 kDa. We hypothesize that these multiple bands arise from varying degrees of glycosylation in MEL cells. The lower protein bands of the LUΔ1, LUΔ2, LUΔ3, and LUΔ5 mutated proteins were expressed as dominant bands, while the upper ones were expressed weakly; the higher band of MEL/LUΔ5 was barely detectable. However, the two protein bands of LUΔ4 were equally expressed, and the molecular weights of these were lower than that of the other four deletion mutants, consistent with the fact that most of the glycosylation sites are on domain 4 (7Campbell I.G. Foulkes W.D. Senger G. Trowsdale J. Garin-Chesa P. Rettig W.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5761-5765PubMed Google Scholar, 20Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Daniels G.L. Green C.A. Smythe J.S. Anstee D.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEL cells transfected with full-length LU cDNA also showed two bands, with molecular mass values of approximately 80 and 95 kDa, suggesting that in MEL cells, LU protein can be more extensively glycosylated than it is in human red cells. Stably transfected MEL cells expressed all the LU domain deletion constructs to a variable but easily detectable degree (MFC = 106.5–165.3, versusMEL/vector MFC = 59.8) when reacted with either anti-Lub mAb or a human anti-LU8 antibody in flow cytometric assays (Fig.3 A). LU8 recognizes the second IgSF domain of LU (20Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Daniels G.L. Green C.A. Smythe J.S. Anstee D.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was therefore used for detecting the expression of LU protein lacking IgSF domain 1 (LUΔ1), because anti-Lub mAb recognizes the first IgSF domain. Binding of LU8 to MEL/vector followed by FITC goat anti-human second Ab resulted in similar “background” fluorescence as that observed with anti-Lub and FITC goat anti-mouse (data not shown). The observed ability of LU proteins without IgSF domains 1, 2, 3, or 4 to bind soluble laminin was variable, most likely in large part due to the different levels of protein expression achieved. Nevertheless, MEL cells expressing the recombinant proteins LUΔ1, LUΔ2, LUΔ3, and LUΔ4 all gave distinctively higher fluorescence when reacted with soluble laminin (MFC = 126.6, 100.3, 110.8, and 120.7, respectively) than did MEL/vector (MFC = 84.7) (Fig.3 B). However, the recombinant LU protein without domain 5 (LUΔ5) bound laminin minimally, with MFC of only about 89.6, even though the expression of LUΔ5 protein detectable by anti-Lub mAb (MFC = 152.4) was much higher than those of LUΔ2 (MFC = 106.5), LUΔ3 (MFC = 117.6), and LUΔ4 (MFC = 139.5). No laminin binding was detected when LUΔ5 was expressed at levels similar in terms of MFC to those of MEL/LUΔ2 or MEL/LUΔ3. These data, therefore, suggested that domain 5 of LU protein is critical for laminin binding. In order to demonstrate that Lutheran domain 5 mediates laminin binding, we deleted from LU cDNA sequences encoding the first four IgSF domains. This new construct (LU5) was translated into a 25-kDa protein by MEL cells and was detected by immunoblot using the anti-domain 5 mAb 4F2 (Fig. 2 B, lane 9). As shown in Fig. 4, mAb 4F2 bound significantly to MEL/LU5, as did soluble laminin, when examined by flow cytometry. We also studied the ability of various mutated LU proteins expressed by stably transfected MEL cells to mediate intact cell adhesion to immobilized laminin using a flow chamber assay. The MEL/vector control cell line began to detach at a shear stress of 0.3 dyne/cm2, and 50% of cells were detached at a shear stress of 0.7 dyne/cm2 (critical shear stress). In contrast, cells expressing LU or LU deletion constructs LUΔ1, LUΔ2, LUΔ3, or LUΔ4 all showed little detachment at shear stress as high as 10 dynes/cm2 (TableIII). The critical shear stress for LUΔ5 transfected MEL cells, however, was only 2.3 dynes/cm2 (Fig. 5), only slightly above that seen with MEL/vector transfectants. In addition, we also tested the adhesion of MEL/LU5 to immobilized laminin under similar flow conditions. As shown in Fig. 5, the critical shear stress of MEL/LU5 attachment to laminin was above 10 dynes/cm2, indicating that LU domain 5 alone is sufficient to mediate strong cell adhesion to immobilized laminin.Table IIIAdhesion to laminin by MEL cells expressing various rLU proteinsCell line/constructCritical shear stressdynes/cm2MEL/VEC0.7MEL/LU>10MEL/LUΔ1>10MEL/LUΔ2>10MEL/LUΔ3>10MEL/LUΔ4>10MEL/LUΔ52.3 Open table in a new tab Scatchard analysis of 125I-labeled anti-Lub mAb binding to SS and normal red cells allowed us to evaluate red cell expression of B-CAM/LU. Although the expression of B-CAM/LU on SS and normal red cells varied among individuals, on average, SS red cells expressed 67% more molecules of B-CAM/LU than did normal red cells, consistent with our earlier observations using flow cytometric assays (6Udani M. Zen Q. Cottman M. Leonard N. Jefferson S. Daymont C. Truskey G. Telen M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The mechanism of B-CAM/LU overexpression on SS cells is not known. While the expression of B-CAM/LU by reticulocytes from sickle cell disease patients was 40–50% higher than that of unfractionated or high density red cells from sickle cell disease patients, expression of B-CAM/LU by dense SS red cells was only minimally different from that of total circulating cells, indicating that overexpression of B-CAM/LU is a characteristic of the total circulating SS red cell population, not only of the reticulocytes. This is also consistent with our previous results using two-color immunostaining and flow cytometry to characterize B-CAM/LU expression on reticulocytes. 3M. Udani, Q. Zen, and M. Telen, unpublished data. The affinity of 125I-labeled anti-Lub mAb binding to B-CAM/LU on either unfractionated or fractionated SS cells, as well as on normal red cells, did not vary significantly, making it unlikely that the Lub epitope of IgSF domain 1 is activated or altered in sickle cell anemia. However, this does not rule out the possibility of conformational change elsewhere in B-CAM/LU of SS cells, especially at the laminin binding site. Our previous data had suggested that soluble laminin binding to both normal and SS red cells was proportional to B-CAM/LU copy number (6Udani M. Zen Q. Cottman M. Leonard N. Jefferson S. Daymont C. Truskey G. Telen M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, under conditions of flow, adhesion of SS red cells to immobilized laminin was at least 3-fold stronger than that of normal red cells. Since our current data indicate that the magnitude of the increased expression of B-CAM/LU is less than 2-fold, the increased laminin binding of SS red cells is likely to be due at least in part to factors other than simple overexpression of the laminin receptor. Possible explanations include that increased adhesion might be partially due to an activation process or that increased B-CAM/LU protein expression markedly enhances homotypic aggregation or protein-protein interaction, leading to receptor activation and much stronger cell adhesion. This study also confirms that both B-CAM and LU proteins can mediate laminin binding. We had previously shown that on Western blot both B-CAM and LU proteins from normal and SS red cells bound soluble laminin and that rB-CAM expressed by MEL cells mediated strong adhesion to immobilized laminin (6Udani M. Zen Q. Cottman M. Leonard N. Jefferson S. Daymont C. Truskey G. Telen M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We have now shown that both B-CAM and LU on intact cells mediated both binding of soluble laminin and adhesion to immobilized laminin equally well. Thus, presence or absence of the cytoplasmic tail of LU does not appear to affect laminin binding. The role of the putative SH3 binding domain or of possible serine/threonine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of LU, as well as the potential functional differences between B-CAM and LU, thus require further study. Expression of LU cDNAs by MEL cells resulted in double bands on Western blot. For the complete LU cDNA, the higher band demonstrated a molecular mass of 95 kDa, even higher than the 85-kDa LU band of red cells. LU deletion mutants also gave two bands. We hypothesize that this phenomenon results from differences in the glycosylation process. Since all five putativeN-glycosylation sites are within domains 3 and 4 (8Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5496-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), deletion of which does not affect laminin binding, it is therefore likely that laminin binding to LU is glycosylation-independent. Studies designed to identify the laminin binding domain of LU by both flow cytometry and flow chamber assays revealed that LU IgSF domain 5 is both critical and sufficient for laminin binding. Only deletion of domain 5 (MEL/LUΔ5) significantly decreased soluble laminin binding to transfected MEL cells, and MEL/LUΔ5 cells detached from immobilized laminin easily at low shear stress (critical shear stress = 2.3 dynes/cm2) under flow conditions. Deletion of all of the other four IgSF domains did not abrogate laminin binding. In addition, MEL/LU5 adhered strongly to immobilized laminin under high shear stress, although, in flow cytometric assays, soluble laminin did not bind to MEL/LU5 as strongly as it bound to MEL/LU. One possibility is that deletion of all first four IgSF domains affected the conformation of the remaining domain 5, altering its ability to bind soluble laminin. A second possibility is that the level of expression of LU5 achieved, which was lower than the level of expression achieved for LU, resulted in lower laminin binding. A third possibility is that additional LU domains may contribute to the localizing of laminin to its binding site on domain 5. So far, structural studies identifying the functional domains of other IgSF proteins, especially IgSF adhesins, have shown the N-terminal IgSF domain(s) as the major heterotypic binding site(s) (13Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 14Klickstein L.B. York M.R. de Fougerolles A.R. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23920-23927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, our work shows that a membrane-proximal IgSF domain can also be a major heterotypic binding site. Laminin, a family of heterotrimeric molecules with molecular masses up to 800 kDa, might be imagined to have difficulty accessing such a membrane-proximal domain. Thus, although LU domain 5 alone could bind to both soluble and immobilized laminin directly, it may not be the first contact point for laminin in vivo. A non-critical site might exist elsewhere in B-CAM/LU and act as a preliminary docking site for laminin, thereby facilitating the attachment of laminin to LU domain 5. With the identification of the active laminin-binding domain of LU, further studies are now feasible to determine the importance of red cell adhesion to laminin in sickle cell vaso-occlusion. We anticipate the generation of inhibitory antibodies or other ligands directed against domain 5, followed by in vivo studies, perhaps in current murine models of sickle cell disease, to determine the physiologic effect of blocking red cell adhesion to laminin. If adhesion to laminin should prove physiologically important in sickle cell anemia, as we suspect, B-CAM/LU may become a new target for therapeutic intervention in this disease. In addition, further investigation into the mechanism of B-CAM/LU overexpression and activation on SS red cells should offer additional opportunities to understand and modulate the vaso-occlusion process. We are indebted to Manisha Udani for technical assistance and many thoughtful suggestions."

Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) lignans, such as plicatic acid 1 (Fig. 1), are deposited in large amount (>20% by dry weight) during its heartwood formation, thereby helping confer protection against invading pathogens (1Gang D.R. Fujita M. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1998; 697: 389-421Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and contributing significantly to the color, quality, and durability of its highly valued heartwood. Other lignans, such as secoisolariciresinol 2 and matairesinol 3, which are present in certain dietary components (e.g. flax (Linum usitatissimum) seed), are thought to substantially reduce the risk in humans of the onset of breast, prostate, and other hormonally linked cancers, as suggested by epidemiological and tumor-induction suppression studies (2Adlercreutz H.

This so-called chemoprotection occurs through their metabolism by intestinal flora into the compounds enterodiol and enterolactone, respectively, both of which act as phytoestrogens, thereby helping to regulate the hormonal balance in the body. Additionally, the secoisolariciresinol2 and matairesinol 3-derived lignan (5Dewick P.M. Atta-ur-Rahman Studies in Natural Product Chemistry. 5. University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan1990: 459-503Google Scholar), podophyllotoxin 4 (as its etoposide or teniposide derivatives) from Podophyllum species, is one of only five or so plant-derived substances used in cancer treatment today (6Stähelin H.

This firstcase of control of bimolecular phenoxy radical coupling is considered to involve a unique biochemical mechanism of radical capture (9Davin L.B. Wang H.-B. Crowell A.L. Bedgar D.L.

The corresponding gene encoding the protein has been cloned, and the functional recombinant protein was obtained using aSpodoptera/baculovirus expression system.1 Additionally, several cDNAs in western red cedar that are homologous to the dirigent protein (11.Lewis, N.

The regio- and enantioselective control of coupling conferred by these homologous proteins, as well as their temporal and tissue-specific expression, are under current investigation. In Forsythia intermedia, (+)-pinoresinol 6a can undergo enantiospecific reduction to first give (+)-lariciresinol7a and then (–)-secoisolariciresinol 2a (see Fig. 2 A). This reductive sequence is catalyzed by the enantiospecific, bifunctional, NADPH-dependent (+)-pinoresinol-(+)-lariciresinol reductase (PLR-Fi1) 2The abbreviations used are: PLR, pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; pfu, plaque-forming unit; IFR, isoflavone reductase.

(–)-Matairesinol 3a biosynthesis then occurs via enantiospecific NADP+-dependent dehydrogenation of (–)-secoisolariciresinol 2a (14Umezawa T. Davin L.B. Yamamoto E. Kingston D.G.I. Lewis N.G. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1990; 20: 1405-1408Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, other species can contain the opposite enantiomeric forms of these lignans (e.g. (+)-secoisolariciresinol2b (∼99% enantiomeric exacess) in flax seed), suggesting that their formation is determined by genes encoding (–)-pinoresinol dirigent proteins and (–)-pinoresinol-(–)-lariciresinol reductases. As an additional complexity, some other species, such asWikstroemia sikokiana, have been proposed to contain pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductases, which may not be fully enantioselective, based on assays using crude cell-free extracts rather than purified proteins (15Umezawa T. Okunishi T. Shimada M. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1998; 697: 377-388Google Scholar). An alternative explanation, however, is that both (+)- and (–)-pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductases are present in such plants, with each being expressed in differing amounts and tissues. The deposition of the lignans plicatic acid 1 and its congeners occurs during western red cedar heartwood formation; this formation is proposed to result from the metabolism of secoisolariciresinol 2 and matairesinol 3 as shown (Fig. 1) (1Gang D.R. Fujita M. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1998; 697: 389-421Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that these metabolites are formed in the transition zone between the living sapwood and the dead heartwood, being deposited into the pre-lignified tissue from the neighboring ray cells via an infusion process (see Ref. 1Gang D.R. Fujita M. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1998; 697: 389-421Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar and references therein). This process of metabolite deposition, therefore, leads to what is known as heartwood, which constitutes some 80–90% of all woody stem tissues. Despite the tremendous importance of this process of metabolite deposition to heartwood formation and its importance to industries that use heartwood as their main resource, particularly the finished wood products and pulp/paper industries, no enzymes or genes have yet been identified that are involved. This can be partly explained by the difficulties in working with heartwoods, especially in extracting proteins from their tissues that are high in phenolic materials. The goal of this study, therefore, was to establish whether the genes encoding pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase(s) were present in T. plicata stem tissue, as a first step toward gaining insight into the biochemical processes accompanying heartwood (lignan) formation. We report herein the identification of two classes of pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductases from T. plicata: the first type reduces (+)-pinoresinol 6a to give (–)-secoisolariciresinol 2a (Fig. 2 A), whereas the second reduces (–)-pinoresinol 6b to produce (+)-secoisolariciresinol 2b (Fig. 2 B). As discussed below, the identification of these two classes of proteins from its stem tissue further illustrates the inherent biochemical complexity involved in control of phenolic coupling and metabolism in higher plants.

DNA and amino acid sequence analyses were performed using the Unix-based GCG Wisconsin Package (16Genetics Computer Group Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar, 17Rice P. The Sanger Centre. Hinxton Hall, Cambridge, United Kingdom1996Google Scholar) and the ExPASy World Wide Web molecular biology server (Geneva University Hospital and University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). Ultraviolet spectra (including RNA and DNA determinations at 260 nm) were recorded on a Lambda 6 UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer). A Temptronic II thermocycler (Thermolyne) was used for all PCR amplifications. Purification of plasmid DNA for sequencing employed a QIAwell Plus plasmid purification system (Qiagen) followed by polyethylene glycol precipitation (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidnam J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, John Wiley & Sons, New York1991Google Scholar) or Wizard® Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega), with DNA sequences determined using an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated sequencer. High performance liquid chromatography was carried out as described previously (12Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, reversed-phase column chromatography employed a Nova-pak C18 column (3.5 mm × 150 mm) (Waters) with an isocratic solvent system consisting of methanol:3% acetic acid in H2O (3:7) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min−1. Separations of (+)- and (–)-secoisolariciresinols 2a and 2b, and (+)- and (–)-pinoresinols 6a and 6b were achieved using a Chiralcel OD column (4.6 mm × 250 mm; Chiral Technology) eluted with ethanol/hexanes 3:7 (flow rate, 0.5 ml min−1) and 1:1 (flow rate, 0.8 ml min−1), respectively. Separations of (+)- and (–)-lariciresinols 7a and7b were achieved using a Chiralcel OC column (4.6 mm × 250 mm) (Chiral Technology) eluted with ethanol/hexanes 4:1 (flow rate, 0.5 ml min−1). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was carried out on a Waters Integrity system. Total RNA (6.7 μg/g fresh weight) was obtained from young green stems (with leaves attached) of a single greenhouse-grown western red cedar tree (T. plicata) according to the method of Lewinsohn et al.(19Lewinsohn E. Steele C.L. Croteau R. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 12: 20-25Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). An initial T. plicata cDNA library (library A) was constructed using 3 μg of purified poly(A)+ mRNA (Oligotex-dTTM Suspension, Qiagen) with the ZAP-cDNA® synthesis kit, the Uni ZAPTM XR vector, and the Gigapack® II Gold packaging extract (Stratagene), with a titer of 1.2 × 105 pfu for the primary library. The amplified library (7.1 × 108pfu/ml; 28 ml total) was used for initial screening (12Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A secondT. plicata cDNA library with a much higher titer (8.8 × 105 pfu for the primary library; 1.34 × 1011 pfu/ml, 180 ml total, for the amplified library) was later constructed (library B) and screened in the same manner as library A to obtain the full-length clones, as described below. TheF. intermedia (+)-pinoresinol-(+)-lariciresinol reductase cDNA (12Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was used to synthesize a probe for screening T. plicata cDNA library A. Purified plasmid (10 ng) containing cDNA of F. intermedia (+)-pinoresinol-(+)-lariciresinol reductase was used as the template in 100-μl PCR reactions (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm each dNTP, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase) with the N-terminal primer PLRN5 (100 pmol) and the internal primer PLRI5R (20 pmol) as described previously (12Dinkova-Kostova A.T.

PCRs were carried out in a thermocycler as follows: 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 42 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C, with 5 min at 72 °C and an indefinite hold at 4 °C after the final cycle. PCR products were resolved in a preparative 1.3% agarose gel where a DNA band corresponding to ∼400 base pairs (called PLRN5-PLRI5R) was isolated. The gel-purified PLRN5-PLRI5R fragment (50 ng) was used with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech T7 Quick Prime® kit and 5 μl (50 μCi) [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci·mmol−1), according to kit instructions, to produce a radiolabeled probe (in 50 μl), which was purified over BioSpin 6 columns (Bio-Rad) and added to carrier DNA (0.5 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), 0.85 ml). 150,000 pfu of T. plicatacDNA library A were plated for primary screening, as described previously (12Dinkova-Kostova A.T.

Plaques were blotted onto Magna Nylon membrane circles (Micron Separations Inc.), which were then allowed to air dry. The membranes were placed between two layers of Whatman® 3MM Chr paper. cDNA library phage DNA was fixed to the membranes and denatured in one step by autoclaving for 4 min at 100 °C with fast exhaust. The membranes were washed for 30 min with gentle shaking at 37 °C in 6× standard saline citrate and 0.1% SDS and prehybridized for 5 h with gentle shaking at 57 °C in preheated 6× standard saline citrate, 0.5% SDS, and 5× Denhardt's reagent (hybridization solution, 220 ml) in a crystallization dish (190 × 75 mm). The32P-radiolabeled probe (see above) was denatured (98 °C for 10 min), quickly cooled (on ice for 15 min), and added to a preheated fresh hybridization solution (50 ml at 57 °C) in a crystallization dish (150 × 75 mm). The prehybridized membranes were next added to this dish, which was then covered with plastic wrap. Hybridization was performed for 17 h at 57 °C with gentle shaking. The membranes were washed in 4× standard saline citrate and 0.5% SDS (250 ml) for 5 min at room temperature, transferred to preheated 2× standard saline citrate and 0.5% SDS (250 ml), and incubated at 57 °C for 20 min with gentle shaking. After the membranes were removed from the dish and wrapped with plastic wrap to prevent drying, they were finally exposed to Kodak X-OMAT AR film for 24 h at −80 °C between intensifying screens. Ten positive plaques were purified through two more rounds of screening with hybridization conditions as above. Ten purified cDNA clones were rescued from the phage following Stratagene's in vivo excision protocol. The cDNAs rescued in pBluescript SK(–) were sequenced using overlapping sequencing primers. Full-length T. plicatapinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase cDNA was obtained from T. plicata mRNA by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) strategy. Briefly, first-strand DNA was synthesized from the purified mRNA previously used for the synthesis ofT. plicata cDNA library. Purified mRNA (150 ng) was mixed with linker-primer (1.4 μg) from ZAP-cDNA®synthesis kit (Stratagene), heated to 70 °C for 10 min, and quickly chilled on ice. The mixture of denatured mRNA template and linker-primer was then mixed with First Strand Buffer (Life Technologies), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmeach dNTP, and 200 units of SuperScriptTM II (Life Technologies) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 50 min and then stopped by heating (70 °C, 15 min). Escherichia coli RNase H (1.5 units, 1 μl) was added to the solution and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The first-strand reaction (2 μl) was next used as the template in 100-μl PCR reactions (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase) with primer CR6-NT (5′GCACATAAGAGTATGGATAAG3′) (10 pmol) and primerXhoI-poly(dT) (5′GTCTCGAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT3′) (10 pmol). The sequence of primer CR6-NT was based on the 5′-end of the truncated cDNAs obtained in the first round of screening (see above). PCR amplification was carried out in a thermocycler as described previously (12Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) except for the annealing temperature at 52 °C. PCR products were resolved in 1.3% agarose gels, where at least two bands possessing the expected length (about 1200 base pairs) were observed. The bands were extracted from the gel. The gel-purified PCR products (56 ng) were then ligated into the pT7Blue T-vector (50 ng) and transformed into competent NovaBlue cells, according to Novagen's instructions. The size and orientation of the inserted cDNA were determined using the rapid boiling lysis and PCR technique (with the following primer combinations: R20-mer + U19-mer, R20-mer + CR6-NT, and U19-mer + CR6-NT primers) according to Novagen's instructions. The CR6-NT primer site of the inserted DNAs was located on the side of U19-mer primer site of the T-vector. The T-vectors containing the inserted cDNAs were purified with Wizard® Plus SV Minipreps DNA purification system, and the inserted cDNAs were completely sequenced using overlapping sequencing primers, revealing five individual cDNA inserts that were identical except for different sites of polyadenylation. The longest cDNA, called PLR-Tp1, was used to screen, as described above, 300,000 pfu ofT. plicata cDNA library B. 19 cDNAs were isolated and completely sequenced. See under “Results and Discussion” for a description of these cDNA clones. The open reading frame of one of the clones encoding PLR-Tp2 was found to be in frame with the β-galactosidase gene α-complementation particle in pBluescript SK(–), allowing for expression of the pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase as a fusion protein (12Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In order for the open reading frame of PLR-Tp1 to be in frame with the β-galactosidase gene α-complementation particle, PLR-Tp1 was excised from the pT7Blue T-vector with SacI and XbaI, gel-purified, and then ligated into pBluescript SK(–) digested with these same enzymes. These two plasmids, pBSPLR-Tp2 and pBSPLR-Tp1, were each transformed into NovaBlue cells according to Novagen's instructions. The transformed cells for each clone (5-ml cultures) were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg ml−1 carbenicillin with shaking (225 rpm) to mid-log phase (A 600 = 0.5–0.7). The cells were next collected by centrifugation (1000 × g for 10 min) and resuspended to an absorbance of 0.6 (at 600 nm) in fresh LB medium supplemented with 10 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 50 μg ml−1 carbenicillin. The cells were allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C and then were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500–700 μl (per 5-ml culture tube) of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Next, the cells were lysed by sonication (five periods of 45 s each). After centrifugation (17,500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min) to pellet cellular debris, the supernatant for each clone was removed and assayed for pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase activity as described below. Both positive and negative assay controls were performed in assays containing equivalent protein amounts from cell-free extracts from induced E. coli cells containing either the parental plasmid (pBluescript SK(–)) without insert DNA (negative control), where no conversion of (±)-pinoresinols was observed with assays incubated for as long as 24 h, or containing the plasmid pBSPLR-Fi1, where the cDNA of authentic F. intermedia(+)-pinoresinol-(+)-lariciresinol reductase was in frame with the β-galactosidase gene α-complementation particle in pBluescript SK(–) (positive control). Pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase activity was assayed by monitoring the formation of (+)-7a and (–)-7b[3,3′-O14CH3]lariciresinols and (–)-2a and (+)-2b[3,3′-O14CH3]secoisolariciresinols (12Dinkova-Kostova A.T.

Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27026-27033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each of triplicate assays consisted of (±)-[3,3′-O14CH3]pinoresinols6a/6b (21Kato M.J. Chu A. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 583-591Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (5 mm in methanol, 33 MBq·mmol−1, 20 μl) and the enzyme preparation (i.e. total soluble protein extract from E. coli, 210 μl). The enzymatic reaction was initiated by addition of NADPH (10 mm, in deionized and distilled H2O, 20 μl). Incubations were carried out at 30 °C with shaking for several different times (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min), after which the assay mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (500 μl) containing (±)-lariciresinols 7a/7b(20 μg) and (±)-secoisolariciresinols 2a/2b(20 μg) as radiochemical carriers. After centrifugation (13,800 × g for 5 min), the ethyl acetate solubles were removed and the extraction procedure was repeated, but without addition of radiochemical carriers. For each assay, the ethyl acetate solubles were combined with an aliquot (100 μl) removed for determination of its radioactivity using liquid scintillation counting. The remainder of the combined ethyl acetate solubles was evaporated to dryness in vacuo, reconstituted in methanol/H2O (3:7, 100 μl) and subjected to reversed-phase and chiral column HPLC. Fractions were collected from the chiral column HPLC separation and analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Assays were conducted as described above but using (±)-[9,9′-2H2, OC2H3]pinoresinols6a/6b as substrates and NADPH as cofactor. After incubation at 30 °C for 24 h, the assay mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 500 μl). The ethyl acetate solubles were combined, evaporated to dryness, reconstituted in methanol/H2O (1:1, 100 μl), and subjected to reversed-phase HPLC. Fractions corresponding to secoisolariciresinol2 and pinoresinol 6 were individually collected, freeze-dried, redissolved in methanol (100 μl), and subjected to chiral column analysis with detection at 280 nm and mass spectral analysis in the electrostatic ionization mode (Integrity System, Waters, Inc.). Formation of western red cedar (T. plicata) heartwood occurs through the massive deposition of the lignans plicatic acid1 and its higher molecular weight congeners into pre-lignified sapwood. Surprisingly, little is known about what induces and ultimately forms both developed heartwood and its forerunner, lignified secondary xylem, in woody plants. This is a curious fact given not only its general biological significance, but also its importance to lumber and pulp/paper operations, which essentially only use secondary xylem containing 80–90% heartwood. From a phenomenological perspective, heartwood formation is initiated in the stem pith, and once initiated continues to expand in diameter across the pre-lignified zone as the plant ages. Depending on the species involved, its formation involves deposition of various metabolites (lignans, flavonoids, tannins, and other substances) into pre-lignified secondary xylem, and these can often account for >20% of the dry weight of the tissue (22MacLean H.

Phytochemistry. 1969; 8: 345-351Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The composition and amounts of these metabolites can vary from plant to plant, and these determine, to a large extent, the properties of the different woods encountered in the plant kingdom. The general process of metabolite deposition leading to heartwood appears to be well conserved in the plant kingdom and was first described almost 50 years ago by Chattaway (31Chattaway M.M. Aust. J.

https://openalex.org/W1979002819,"An understanding of the molecular basis of hormonal activation of receptors provides important insights for drug design. Toward this end, intrinsic photoaffinity labeling is a powerful tool to directly identify the ligand-binding domain. We have developed a new radioiodinatable agonist ligand of the secretin receptor that incorporates a photolabilep-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) into the position of Leu22 and have utilized this to identify the adjacent receptor domain. The rat [Tyr10,Bpa22]secretin-27 probe was a fully efficacious agonist, with a potency to stimulate cAMP accumulation by Chinese hamster ovary SecR cells similar to that of natural secretin (EC50 = 68 ± 22 pm analogue and 95 ± 25 pm secretin). It bound specifically and with high affinity (K i = 5.0 ± 1.1 nm) and covalently labeled the M r = 57,000–62,000 secretin receptor. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the receptor yielded a major labeled fragment of apparent M r = 19,000 that shifted to M r = 9,000 after deglycosylation. This was most consistent with either of two glycosylated domains within the amino-terminal tail of the receptor. Immunoprecipitation with antibody directed to epitope tags incorporated into each of the candidate domains established that the fragment at the amino terminus of the receptor was the site of labeling. This was further localized to the amino-terminal 30 residues of the receptor by additional proteolysis of this fragment with endoproteinase Lys-C. This provides the first direct demonstration of a contact between a secretin-like agonist and its receptor and will contribute a useful constraint to the modeling of this interaction.

The secretin receptor is prototypic of a recently recognized family (Class II) of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) 1The abbreviations used are: G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Bpa, p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Bpa, p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.-coupled receptors (1Kolakowski L.F. Recept. Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Members of this family are believed to have the seven-transmembrane segment topology typical of the superfamily, but they share <12% homology with the extensively studied Class I receptors in the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor family, and they lack the signature sequences of this family (2Segre G.V.

Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 382-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Secretin family receptors have long amino-terminal domains incorporating six highly conserved Cys residues, believed to contribute to disulfide bonds that help define the family (3Ulrich II, C.D.

Other extracellular loop domains have also been implicated in complementary roles for agonist binding and receptor activation (4Vilardaga J.P. Di Paolo E. Bialek C. De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Bollen A.

Commun. 1996; 218: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Natural ligands for this family of receptors are all peptides longer than 27 residues, with structure-activity series suggesting the presence of diffuse pharmacophoric domains (3Ulrich II, C.D. Holtmann M. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 382-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although this large diffuse pharmacophore nicely complements the multiple domains predicted to be outside the membrane bilayer, there is no working model to predict how the two molecules might interact. In this work, we attempt to establish an initial constraint that will contribute to the development of a model for the interaction of secretin with its receptor. We do this through photoaffinity labeling. This has the theoretical advantage of directly probing the domain adjacent to the photolabile residue within the probe after it binds to the receptor. Using this approach, we have successfully identified two binding contacts between photolabile analogues of cholecystokinin and its receptor (11Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P.

In this work, we have developed an analogue of secretin that incorporates a site for radioiodination and a photolabile residue intrinsic to the pharmacophore for establishment of a covalent bond to a domain of the receptor adjacent to it as it resides in its binding site. We have characterized this as a fully efficacious and potent agonist, likely to reside in the natural secretin-binding site within the secretin receptor. We have characterized its high affinity, saturable, and specific binding to the receptor, and we have demonstrated that it efficiently covalently labels the secretin receptor in a single distinct domain. This domain was identified as the amino-terminal 30 residues of the amino-terminal tail of the secretin receptor. Although it is too early to know how generalizable such a contact may be within the secretin receptor family, this is likely since themes for the impact of mutagenesis for various members of this family have been generally consistent. Wheat germ agglutinin-agarose was from EY Laboratories, Inc. (San Mateo, CA). Endoproteinase Lys-C and anti-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope monoclonal antibody were from Boehringer Mannheim. Iodoacetic acid was from Pierce. Endoglycosidase F was prepared in our laboratory, as we have reported (13Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Powers S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other reagents were analytical grade. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were used as source of receptors for this study. The CHO-SecR cell line stably expressing the wild-type rat secretin receptor has been previously established and characterized (14Ulrich II, C.D. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Chang-Miller A. Gates L.K. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two new cell lines were established for this report. These express secretin receptor mutants in which the HA epitope (with sequence YPYDVPDYA) was inserted after residue 36 (SecR-HA37) and after residue 78 (SecR-HA79) of the wild-type rat secretin receptor. Constructs were prepared by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (15Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar) of the wild-type rat secretin receptor cDNA in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and had their identities checked by direct dideoxynucleotide chain termination DNA sequencing (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52494) Google Scholar). These cell lines were established in a similar manner to the CHO-SecR cell line (14Ulrich II, C.D. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Chang-Miller A. Gates L.K. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), transfecting non-receptor-bearing CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), enriching the population of cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and selecting clonal populations of cells by a series of limiting dilutions. The CHO-SecR-HA37 and CHO-SecR-HA79 cell lines were selected based on their expression of a high density of the relevant secretin receptor constructs and having clear cAMP responses to secretin stimulation. These cell lines had their binding and signaling characteristics fully characterized. Cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in an environment containing 5% CO2 on Falcon tissue culture plastic ware in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% Fetal Clone-2 (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were passaged twice a week and were lifted mechanically prior to membrane preparation. Enriched plasma membranes were prepared from these cell lines, as we previously described (17Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Rat secretin-27, rat [Tyr10]secretin-27, and rat [Tyr10,Bpa22]secretin-27 were synthesized using solid-phase manual techniques, as we previously reported (12Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L.

The t-butoxycarbonylbenzoylphenylalanine residue was synthesized as per Kauer et al. (18Kauer J.C. Erickson-Viitanen S. Wolfe H.R. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10695-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was incorporated as an intact blocked residue into the appropriate position during synthesis. Design of the rat [Tyr10,Bpa22]secretin-27 probe provided a site for oxidative radioiodination that is known to be accommodated without interfering with secretin activity (14Ulrich II, C.D. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Chang-Miller A. Gates L.K. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and a site for cross-linking at a photolabile Bpa incorporated into position 22, where there is a Phe residue in chicken secretin and where apara-nitrophenylalanine has been previously successfully incorporated (14Ulrich II, C.D. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Chang-Miller A. Gates L.K. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC. The identities of the peptides were assured by amino acid analysis and Edman degradation sequencing. The Tyr10-containing peptides were radioiodinated oxidatively with Na125I, exposing it to the solid-phase oxidantN-chlorobenzenesulfonamide (IODO-BEAD, Pierce) for 15 s and purifying the product by reversed-phase HPLC to yield specific radioactivities of 2,000 Ci/mmol. The peptide corresponding to the hemagglutinin epitope (YPYDVPDYA) that was incorporated into the epitope-tagged secretin receptor constructs was also synthesized using solid-phase techniques and purified by reversed-phase HPLC (19Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The agonist activity of rat [Tyr10, Bpa22]secretin-27 was studied using an assay for cAMP in lysates from CHO-SecR cells stimulated with secretin and secretin analogues that was performed with reagents provided by Diagnostic Products Corp. (Los Angeles, CA). The assay was performed as we have previously described (20Ganguli S.C. Park C.-G. Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Kenakin T.P. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). The same assay was utilized to determine the signaling characteristics of the two cell lines established to express HA epitope-tagged secretin receptors. In brief, cells were stimulated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold perchloric acid. After adjusting the pH to 6 with KHCO3, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were used in the assay. Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting in a Beckman LS6000. All assays were performed in duplicate and repeated in at least three independent experiments. Binding of rat [Tyr10,Bpa22]secretin-27 to secretin receptors was characterized in a standard assay using cells or membranes from the CHO-SecR cell line as the source of receptor (7Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,14Ulrich II, C.D. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Chang-Miller A. Gates L.K. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Membranes (1–10 μg) or 106 cells were incubated with a constant amount of rat [125I-Tyr10]secretin-27 (3–5 pm) and increasing concentrations of nonradioactive secretin analogue (0–1 μm) for 1 h at room temperature in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) medium (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin). Bound and free radioligands were separated using a Skatron cell harvester with glass-fiber filter mats that had been soaked in 0.3% Polybrene, and bound radioactivity was quantified in a γ-spectrometer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm secretin and represented <20% of total binding. The same assay was also utilized to characterize the binding activity of the two cell lines established to express HA epitope-tagged secretin receptors. For covalent labeling, receptor-bearing membranes from the secretin receptor-bearing cells containing ∼100 μg of protein were incubated with rat [125I-Tyr10,Bpa22]secretin-27 (0.1–1 nm) in KRH medium in the absence or presence of concentrations of nonradiolabeled secretin ranging up to 1 μm. Incubations were performed for 1 h at room temperature. The incubation mixture was frozen and exposed to photolysis in a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Hamden, CT) equipped with 3500-Å lamps for 30 min at 4 °C. Membranes were then pelleted, washed, and exposed to reduction and alkylation. Reduction was accomplished by suspension of the membranes in KRH medium containing 5 mm dithiothreitol in a nitrogen environment at room temperature for 1 h. This was followed by alkylation with 2 mm iodoacetic acid under the same conditions for another 1 h. Membrane proteins were then either directly applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar) or solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 in KRH medium, prior to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose affinity chromatography and subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The affinity-labeled secretin receptor and relevant receptor fragments were deglycosylated with endoglycosidase F using techniques previously described (17Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Gel-purified, affinity-labeled native and deglycosylated secretin receptors were digested with cyanogen bromide in 70% formic acid according to the procedure previously described (12Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R. Lybrand T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Endoproteinase Lys-C digestion (20 μg/ml) was performed at 37 °C for 24 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmEDTA, and 0.1% SDS. Receptor fragments were resolved on 10% NuPAGE gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) with MES running buffer. The apparent molecular masses of radiolabeled receptor fragments were determined by interpolation on a plot of the mobility of MultimarkTMprotein standards (Novex) versus the log values of their apparent masses. The radiolabeled fragments of the affinity-labeled, epitope-tagged secretin receptors resulting from cyanogen bromide digestion were unambiguously identified by immunoprecipitation. For this, fragments were solubilized for 15 min at room temperature in 200 μl of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor. Samples were divided in half, with one tube containing competing HA peptide (25 μm) and all tubes having anti-HA monoclonal antibody (2 μg). After 2 h of incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking, heat-inactivated, fixed Staphylococcus aureus (10 μl) cells were added to bind antigen-antibody complexes. After an additional hour, the adsorbent was pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 2 min and washed with 1 ml of solubilization buffer without bovine serum albumin. Proteins bound to the washed pellet were eluted in SDS-containing sample buffer and separated by NuPAGE gel electrophoresis. All observations were repeated at least three times in independent experiments and are expressed as the means ± S.E. Binding curves were analyzed using the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (22Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar) and were plotted using the nonlinear regression analysis routine for radioligand binding in the Prism software package (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA). The rat [Tyr10,Bpa22]secretin-27 analogue of secretin was synthesized, purified to homogeneity, and characterized by amino acid analysis and Edman degradation sequencing (Fig.1). It was a fully efficacious and potent agonist at the secretin receptor, as demonstrated by its ability to stimulate cAMP accumulation in receptor-bearing CHO-SecR cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2). The analogue stimulated cAMP with an EC50 of 68 ± 22 pm, not statistically different from natural secretin (95 ± 25 pm). Consistent with this, the analogue bound to the secretin receptor saturably, specifically, and with high affinity (Fig. 2). Analysis of the binding data with this analogue best fit a single site with aK i of 5.0 ± 1.1 nm. This also was not different from natural secretin.Figure 2Binding and biological activity characteristics of rat [Tyr10,Bpa22]secretin-27. The left panel illustrates the abilities of increasing concentrations of secretin (Sec) and the photolabile secretin analogue to compete for the binding of rat [125I-Tyr10]secretin-27 to CHO-SecR cell membranes. Values are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments, with data presented as percentages of maximal saturable binding. The right panel illustrates the abilities of increasing concentrations of these peptides to stimulate cAMP accumulation in CHO-SecR cells. Values are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate, with data normalized relative to the maximal response to natural secretin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The photolabile secretin analogue covalently labeled a plasma membrane protein from the CHO-SecR cells that migrated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel at apparent M r = 57,000–62,000 (Fig.3). This labeling was saturable and competed in a concentration-dependent manner with unlabeled secretin. Densitometric analysis of three similar experiments is also shown in Fig. 3. The IC50 for this competition was 6.5 ± 2.4 nm, in the range expected from the binding affinity given the large amount of radioligand used in these experiments. As previously reported for the secretin receptor (3Ulrich II, C.D. Holtmann M. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 382-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F shifted the migration of the labeled band toM r = 42,000 (Fig. 3). Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the affinity-labeled secretin receptor was used as a first indication of the receptor domain being covalently labeled. Shown in Fig.4 is a graphical representation of the sites of cyanogen bromide cleavage of this receptor and the characteristics of the expected fragments. Protein cores of these fragments range in mass from 1 to 11 kDa, with three of the fragments also containing potential sites of N-linked glycosylation. Also shown in Fig. 4 is a typical autoradiograph of a 10% NuPAGE gel used to separate the products of cyanogen bromide cleavage of the labeled native and deglycosylated receptor. This consistently demonstrated a specifically labeled band migrating atM r ∼ 19,000 that shifted toM r ∼ 9,000 after deglycosylation. Given that the ligand probe has a mass of 3,341 Da, the core protein of the labeled fragment should be in the 5,700-Da range. With this and the requisite need for glycosylation, the only candidates represent the first and third fragments, both within the amino-terminal tail of the secretin receptor. One candidate fragment is at the end of this domain, and the other is adjacent to the first transmembrane domain. These have characteristics that are too similar for them to be distinguished by this simple manipulation. To determine which of these domains included the site of covalent attachment, two secretin receptor constructs were prepared that incorporated HA epitope tags within each of these cyanogen bromide fragments. Each of these constructs was expressed stably in a CHO cell line. These were characterized to demonstrate normal secretin binding and signaling characteristics (Fig. 5). Each of these epitope-tagged receptor-bearing cell lines was effectively affinity-labeled with the rat [125I-Tyr10,Bpa22]secretin-27 probe (Fig. 6), with the labeled epitope-tagged secretin receptor migrating at a slightly higher apparent M r than the wild-type receptor (14Ulrich II, C.D. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Chang-Miller A. Gates L.K. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both intact epitope-tagged receptor constructs were well recognized by the anti-HA monoclonal antibody, as demonstrated by their saturable immunoprecipitation in the absence and presence of competing HA peptide (Fig. 6). However, after cyanogen bromide cleavage, only the epitope-tagged first fragment was radioactive, containing the site of affinity labeling with the radioiodinated probe (Fig. 6). This immunoprecipitation was also saturable with excess HA peptide (Fig. 6). This provides definitive identification of the amino-terminal end of the amino-terminal tail of the secretin receptor as the site of covalent attachment through Bpa22.Figure 6Immunoprecipitation of cyanogen bromide fragments of secretin receptor constructs incorporating epitope tags within the first and third fragments. Shown are the sequences of the key HA epitope-tagged secretin receptor fragments and autoradiographs of 10% NuPAGE gels used to separate immunoprecipitated proteins or peptides. Each immunoprecipitation was attempted with a similar amount of antibody in the absence and presence of competing HA peptide. The left panel demonstrates that after photoaffinity labeling of these receptor constructs and solubilization, they were both immunoprecipitated by the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Ab), with this effectively competed by excess HA peptide. The right panel shows that only the epitope-tagged first fragment was radioactive, reflecting the presence of covalently attached rat [125I-Tyr10,Bpa22]secretin-27.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further localize the site of covalent labeling of the receptor with this probe, this cyanogen bromide fragment was further cleaved with endoproteinase Lys-C. As shown in Fig. 7, this proteolytic enzyme cleaves at the carboxyl-terminal side of Lys residues, dividing the first cyanogen bromide fragment of the receptor into a non-glycosylated fragment with a mass of 3,425 Da, a glycosylated fragment with core protein of 1,808 Da, and two tiny fragments. A typical autoradiograph of a NuPAGE gel used to separate various fragments of the affinity-labeled secretin receptor is shown in Fig. 7. As expected, the labeled cyanogen bromide fragment of this receptor migrated at M r ∼ 19,000 and shifted to M r = 9,000 after deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F. Endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of each of these fragments shifted the labeled fragment to migrate atM r ∼ 6,000, with similar migration of both the native and deglycosylated fragments. Given the mass of the attached probe and the absence of effect of deglycosylation on electrophoretic migration of the labeled products of endoproteinase Lys-C digestion, the data support the covalent attachment of this probe to the secretin receptor through the amino-terminal portion of the first fragment. Further evidence for the identity of the site of labeling as the amino-terminal domain of the first fragment came from the endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of the intact receptor, again yielding a labeled band of this same size (Fig. 7). The superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors is extensive and diverse, binding and being activated by ligands as different as photons, odorants, biogenic amines, small peptides, and large glycoproteins. Our understanding of the molecular basis of ligand binding is most advanced for small molecules, such as the biogenic amines, where the binding domain is intramembranous (23Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 24Schwartz T.W. Rosenkilde M.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 213-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Binding of peptide ligands appear to be more complex, with determinants closer to the external face of the bilayer and within external loop domains. The examples of true rational design of drugs acting at peptide hormone receptors are limited, and almost all of these are antagonists. Successful mimicking of natural peptide agonists with small non-peptidyl compounds is only beginning to be successful (25Aquino C.J. Armour D.R. Berman J.M. Birkemo L.S. Carr R.A.E. Croom D.K. Dezube M. Dougherty Jr., R.W. Ervin G.N. Grizzle M.K. Head J.E. Hirst G.C. James M.K. Johnson M.F. Miller L.J. Queen K.L. Rimele T.J. Smith D.N. Sugg E.E. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and only by screening large libraries of compounds. The development of such drugs using structure-based rational design will be markedly advanced by a better understanding of the molecular basis of ligand binding and receptor activation. In this work, we focus on the molecular basis of agonist binding for a recently recognized group of G protein-coupled receptors, the secretin receptor family (Class II). Members of this family were first identified in 1991 (26Ishihara T. Nakamura S. Kaziro Y. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 27Lin H.Y. Harris T.L. Flannery M.S. Aruffo A. Kaji E.H. Gorn A. Kolakowski L.F. Lodish H.F. Goldring S.R.

Segre G.V. Science. 1991; 254: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) and were noted to be structurally quite distinct from the extensively studied rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor family (Class I). The secretin family receptors have <12% sequence homology to the rhodopsin family and are missing all the signature sequences of that family. Although the predicted seven-transmembrane segment topology was felt to be intact in the secretin receptor family, substantial differences are even predicted to be present in the helical packing motifs (29Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A prominent feature of this family is a moderately long and complex amino-terminal tail region, incorporating a series of conserved Cys residues that are predicted to contribute to critical disulfide bonds (3Ulrich II, C.D.

This theme has also been consistent for several other receptors in the secretin receptor family, including the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor (5Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J.

Because of the indirect nature of most mutagenesis studies, in which a function is lost or impeded, and the paucity of examples of successful unambiguous gain-of-function mutagenesis experiments, we have used the complementary approach of direct photoaffinity labeling of the ligand-binding domain of the receptor. We hoped that this would provide an unambiguous constraint to use in the initial modeling of the secretin-binding domain. This approach is dependent on the spatial proximity between a photolabile group incorporated into a ligand as it resides in its binding site and a portion of the receptor molecule. It is also critical that the photolabile group has appropriate chemical reactivity to form a covalent bond with the receptor. We chose a benzoylphenylalanine residue to incorporate into a secretin analogue because of the favorable characteristics and substantial experience with this residue (12Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z.

Furthermore, it was a reasonable substitute for the Phe residue present in position 22 in chicken secretin and for the para-nitrophenylalanine residue that was previously well tolerated in the same position in another secretin analogue probe (14Ulrich II, C.D.

The efficiency of covalent attachment of the benzophenone precursor probe to the secretin receptor was much greater than that of the nitroaryl probe used previously (14Ulrich II, C.D. Pinon D.I.

This increased efficiency was critical to facilitate the mapping of the receptor domain that was labeled. It is noteworthy that the intrinsic photoaffinity labeling approach identified the amino-terminal tail of the secretin receptor as the site of covalent attachment to the probe. This is consistent with the previous secretin receptor mutagenesis studies (5Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

Goldring S.R. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 876-884PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest, this work demonstrates proximity between the carboxyl-terminal region of secretin (and residue 22 in particular) and the amino-terminal end of the amino-terminal tail of the secretin receptor. This is quite similar to the very recent localization of the region of the parathyroid hormone receptor interacting with a photolabile residue in position 23 of a 36-residue analogue of parathyroid hormone (42Mannstadt M. Luck M.D. Gardella T.J. Juppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16890-16896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This is distinct from the covalent labeling of a domain of the amino-terminal tail of the parathyroid hormone receptor that is adjacent to the first transmembrane domain when using a probe with the site of cross-linking in position 13 of the probe (41Zhou A.T.

The domain adjacent to the first transmembrane domain was also identified as important for secretin action by mutagenesis (7Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although it has not yet been directly identified in affinity labeling experiments. The molecular contacts in the amino-terminal tail of the Class II G protein-coupled receptors that have been gleaned from photoaffinity labeling studies will be much more meaningful once the disulfide bonds in this domain are also mapped. In the presence of such constraints and the extensive insights into the conformation of peptides representing natural ligands for these receptors (44Bodanszky M. Bodanszky A.

https://openalex.org/W2032728378,"Abstract The response of the pituitary gonadotrope to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) correlates directly with the concentration of GnRH receptors (GnRHR) on the cell surface, which is mediated in part at the level of GnRHR gene expression. Several hormones have been implicated in this regulation, most notably GnRH itself. Despite these observations and the central role that GnRH is known to play in reproductive development and function, the molecular mechanism(s) by which GnRH regulates transcription of the GnRHR gene has not been well elucidated. Previous studies in this laboratory have identified and partially characterized the promoter region of the mouse GnRHR gene and demonstrated that the regulatory elements for tissue-specific expression as well as for GnRH regulation are present within the 1.2-kilobase 5′-flanking sequence. By using deletion and mutational analysis as well as functional transfection studies in the murine gonadotrope-derived αT3-1 cell line, we have localized GnRH responsiveness of the mouse GnRHR gene to two DNA sequences at −276/−269 (designated Sequence UnderlyingResponsiveness to GnRH-2 (SURG-2), which contains the consensus sequence for the activating protein-1-binding site) and −292/−285 (a novel element designated SURG-1), and demonstrated that this response is mediated via protein kinase C. By using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we further demonstrate that a member(s) of the Fos/Jun heterodimer superfamily is responsible in part for the DNA-protein complexes formed on SURG-2, using αT3-1 nuclear extracts. These data define a bipartite GnRH response element in the mouse GnRHR 5′-flanking sequence and suggest that the activating protein-1 complex plays a central role in conferring GnRH responsiveness to the murine GnRHR gene."

In this study, we show that the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) from HT 1080 human fibrosarcoma cells was stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in a time- and dose-dependent manner that involved protein kinase C. The phorbol ester also increased PLD activity in the cells. Evidence that PLD was involved in the stimulation of MMP-9 secretion was provided by the observations that the secretion of MMP-9 was stimulated by the introduction of short-chain phosphatidic acid (PA) into the growth medium and that inhibition of PA production by 1-propanol inhibited secretion. Using a short-chain diacylglycerol we excluded the possibility that MMP-9 secretion was induced by diacylglycerol formed from PA by phosphatidic acid phosphatase. Furthermore, propranolol, an inhibitor of this enzyme, had no effect on secretion induced by either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or PA.

ARFs also activate phospholipase D (PLD), and it has been suggested that the Golgi-associated PLD mediates some of the effects of ARF on the Golgi (6Kahn R.A. Yucel J.K. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 75: 1045-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that phosphatidic acid (PA), the product of phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by PLD, promotes vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi (7Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and also budding of secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (8Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that PA stimulates the assembly of COPI on the Golgi (10Ktistakis N.T. Brown N.A. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 134: 295-306Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). PLD has also been reported to regulate the recruitment of the adapter proteins required for clathrin coat assembly on the Golgi (11West M.A. Bright N.A. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In summary, although the exact role of PLD remains unclear, there is much evidence that it participates in the control of vesicular trafficking to, through, and from Golgi components. Secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) from cancer cells is an important stage in the metastatic spread. MMPs hydrolyze collagen, a major component of the extracellular matrix, and allow the invasion of cancer cells from their primary site to the circulation and secondary sites (12Liotta L.A. Tryggvason K. Garbisa S. Gehron-Robey P. Abe S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Liotta L.A. Abe S. Gehron-Robey P. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Commun. 1988; 154: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Various stimuli, including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), have been shown to induce the secretion of MMP-9 from cancer cell lines (15Mackay A.R. Ballin M. Pelina M.D. Farina A.R. Nason A.M. Hartzler J.L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Invasion Metastasis. 1992; 12: 168-184PubMed Google Scholar) including the human fibrosarcoma line HT 1080 (16Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Goldberg G.I. Collier I.E. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Marmer B.L. Wilhelm S.M. Matrix. 1992; 1 (suppl.): 25-30Google Scholar). Focusing on the mechanisms regulating Golgi functions, we investigated the regulation of MMP-9 secretion from HT 1080 cells. PMA stimulated both MMP-9 secretion and PLD activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A role for PLD was indicated by the observation that inhibition of PA production blocked MMP-9 secretion. Furthermore, the addition of dioctanoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA) induced high secretion of MMP-9. The effect of DOPA seemed to be direct because the product of its hydrolysis by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) dioctanoylglycerol (DOG) had only a minor effect on secretion. Moreover, inhibition of PAP with propranolol had no effect on secretion induced by DOPA or PMA. These findings and those to be reported elsewhere 2B.-T. Williger, W.-T. Ho, S. Gharachoulou, and J. H. Exton, manuscript in preparation. implicate ARF and PLD in the stimulation of MMP-9 secretion by protein kinase C (PKC). Essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) and PMA were products of Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum, and all other supplements for growth media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. [9,10-3H]Myristic acid was a product of NEN Life Science Products. Polyacrylamide 10% zymogram gels, zymogram renaturing, and developing buffers were products of Novex. All organic solvents were of fine grade and were obtained from Fisher. Cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (growth medium) at 37 °C and in 10% CO2 atmosphere. For MMP-9 assays 6 × 105 cells were seeded in 60-mm plates and then allowed to grow for 24 h. Prior to the experiments, cells were serum-deprived for 18 h in DMEM, 0.1% BSA. For PLD assays, 35-mm plates were seeded with 3.5 × 105 cells. After 24 h, the cells were serum-deprived and labeled in DMEM, 0.1% BSA with 1 μCi/ml [3H]myristic acid for 18 h. The serum-deprived and labeled cells were washed with DMEM, 0.1% BSA, and following a 20-min preincubation in DMEM, 0.1% BSA, and 0.3% 1-butanol, they were stimulated with PMA at the concentrations and times given in the figure legends. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (1.68 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 8.05 mmNa2PO4, 137 nm NaCl) and 0.1% BSA, scraped with 1 ml of ice-cold CH3OH, and transferred into glass tubes. CHCl3 and 0.1 m HCl were added to a final ratio of 1:1:1. The lipid-containing lower phase was collected, dried under a nitrogen stream, and dissolved in 30 μl of CH3OH:CHCl3 (1:1). The samples were loaded on thin layer chromatography plates that were developed in the lower phase of H2O:ethyl acetate:acidic acid:iso-octane (100:110:20:50). Tritiated phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut) was measured after the band corresponding to the PtdBut standard was scraped (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.). Before the assays, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM, 0.1% BSA containing, unless otherwise described, either 100 nm PMA or 80 μg/ml DOPA. Medium samples were collected, unless otherwise described, after 7.5 h and loaded with nonreducing sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) on 10% zymogram gels. Before developing, the gels were rinsed for 30 min in renaturing buffer and then for 30 min in developing buffer at room temperature. Gels were incubated in fresh developing buffer for 18 h at 37 °C. MMP-9 activity was indicated by clear bands at 92 kDa that appeared after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and removal of excess dye by an 18-h rinse in water. Gels were dried and scanned, and then the image was inverted (clear to black and black to clear) for presentation. To investigate the role of PLD and PA in the induction of MMP-9 secretion from HT 1080 cells, we established whether PMA stimulated MMP-9 secretion from HT 1080 cells. The cells were treated with PMA for various times, and then medium samples were assayed for collagenolytic activity. Fig.1 A illustrates that MMP-9 activity accumulated in the medium of cells treated with PMA in a time-dependent manner, whereas no activity was observed in untreated cells or cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide, the solvent for PMA. The effect of PMA was dose-dependent, with secretion being detected with concentrations as low as 0.5–1 nm and reaching a plateau at 50–100 nm PMA (Fig. 1 B). Finally, the expected involvement of PKC in the PMA effect was confirmed by the inhibition of secretion in cells treated with the PKC blocker Ro 31-8220 (Fig. 1 C). PKC isozymes have a broad spectrum of effects and among these is the activation of PLD (18Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that PLD and its product PA are important for vesicular trafficking involving the Golgi (6Kahn R.A. Yucel J.K. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 75: 1045-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr.

Therefore, we tested for the possible involvement of PLD in the stimulation of MMP-9 secretion by PMA. We checked if PMA induced PLD activation in HT 1080 cells. HT 1080 cells prelabeled with [3H]myristate were stimulated with PMA for various times, and PLD activity was measured by the formation of [3H]PtdBut from 1-butanol. As shown in Fig.2, PtdBut formation was rapidly induced and reached a maximum at 90 min. The response was detectable with 1 nm PMA and maximal at 100 nm PMA (data not shown). Although the preceding experiments showed that PLD was activated in PMA-treated HT 1080 cells, they provided no evidence that PLD was involved in the secretory pathway. To test this, the cells were treated with various concentrations of a short-chain (dioctanoyl) PA (DOPA). Fig. 3 shows that DOPA induced MMP-9 secretion in a dose-dependent manner with secretion reaching a plateau at 80 μg/ml. A role for PLD (PA) in the pathway leading to MMP-9 secretion received further support when 1-propanol was used to block PA production by PLD by virtue of the formation of phosphatidylpropanol through the transphosphatidylation reaction. Cells were first treated with various concentrations of 1-propanol or, for control, 2-propanol and then stimulated with PMA. Medium samples were collected after 7.5 h and analyzed for MMP-9 secretion. Secretion was inhibited by 100 mm 1-propanol but not by the same concentration of 2-propanol (Fig.4 A). At 200 mm, both alcohols were inhibitory, but the effect of 1-propanol was complete. In an additional experiment we checked secretion from cells treated with 133 mm 1- or 2-propanol prior to stimulation with various PMA concentrations. Although MMP-9 secretion was increased by increasing concentrations of PMA in the presence of 2-propanol, 1-propanol almost totally inhibited secretion (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that PLD activity and the intracellular accumulation of PA are importantly involved in PKC-dependent MMP-9 secretion.Figure 4MMP-9 secretion is inhibited by 1-propanol. Overnight serum-deprived cells were incubated with freshly added DMEM, 0.1% BSA. A, the indicated concentrations of either 2-propanol or 1-propanol were then added. After 45 min, 100 nm PMA was added, and cells were incubated for 7.5 h after which 5-μl medium samples were analyzed for MMP-9 secretion. B, the cells were incubated with 133 nm 2-propanol or 1-propanol for 45 min. PMA was then introduced to give the indicated concentrations. The cells were incubated for 7.5 h after which 5-μl medium samples were analyzed for MMP-9 secretion. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the preceding experiments, medium samples for the MMP-9 secretion assay were taken after 7.5 h. This is because the MMP-9 activity in shorter incubations was too low to give reliable quantitative measurements (Fig. 1 A). Several reasons could account for this, but one is that prolonged PLD activity is necessary for MMP-9 secretion. To address this possibility, cells were treated with PMA, and 133 mm 1-propanol was added at hourly intervals after the addition of PMA. After 7.5 h, medium samples were collected and analyzed for MMP-9 secretion (Fig.5). The figure illustrates that the presence of 1-propanol during the first 2–3 h almost fully inhibited MMP-9 secretion. At later times, there was partial suppression of secretion. These data indicate that prolonged formation of PA is important in the action of PMA on MMP-9 secretion. Although the preceding results implicated PLD and PA formation in the regulation of MMP-9 secretion, they did not prove that PA was the signaling molecule involved. This is because it was possible that PA was converted to a diacylglycerol. Two approaches were used to show that PA rather than diacylglycerol had a role in inducing secretion. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of DOG, and then medium samples were assayed for collagenolytic activity. As is shown in Fig. 6 A, DOG had only a minor effect on secretion, even at a concentration higher than that of DOPA. In additional experiments, the secretion of MMP-9 was assayed in cells pretreated with propranolol, an inhibitor of PAP activity (19Koul O. Hauser G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 253: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 B shows that propranolol had no effect on the secretion of MMP-9 from cells treated with either PMA or DOPA.

Pelina M.D. Farina A.R. Nason A.M. Hartzler J.L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Invasion Metastasis. 1992; 12: 168-184PubMed Google Scholar). We have confirmed that in human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells, MMP-9 is secreted in response to PMA (17Goldberg G.I. Collier I.E. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Marmer B.L. Wilhelm S.M. Matrix. 1992; 1 (suppl.): 25-30Google Scholar). As expected, the secretory pathway involves the Golgi as revealed by the inhibition of secretion by brefeldin A and other agents that interfere with ARF activation or action.2 The most novel finding in the present study is the apparent involvement of PLD in the effect of PMA (PKC) on MMP-9 secretion. Although PMA was shown here to activate PLD in HT 1080 cells as in many other cell types (18Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), the phorbol ester undoubtedly induced many other changes that could be involved in the secretory response. However, the evidence favors PLD as an important target of PKC in the stimulation of MMP-9 secretion. Importantly, inhibition of PA formation through the addition of the primary alcohol 1-propranol blocked MMP-9 secretion, whereas 2-propanol, which does not participate in transphosphatidylation (20Ella K.M. Meier K.E. Kumar A. Zhang Y. Meier G.P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 41: 715-724PubMed Google Scholar), had much less effect. Furthermore, direct addition of a short-chain PA to the cells was as effective as PMA in stimulating MMP-9 release, supporting the postulated role of PLD. The present study does not define the cellular site of action of PLD. However, it is very probable that it is the Golgi, because there is much evidence that PLD is involved in protein trafficking involving this organelle (6Kahn R.A. Yucel J.K. Malhotra V.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and exogenous PA can relieve the inhibition of MMP-9 secretion induced by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of Golgi function.2 In addition, prolonged activation of PLD was required for the effect of PMA (Fig. 5) consistent with its involvement in a relatively slow process. The PLD isoform (PLD1) that has been localized to the Golgi (21Colley W.C. Sung T.-C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr.

These observations provide additional support for a site of action at this organelle. Because PA can be metabolized to other lipids such as diacylglycerol (by PAP) or lysophosphatidic acid (by phospholipase A2), the initial results provided no assurance that the observed effects of added PA were because of this lipid per se. However, the possibility that diacylglycerol was the active lipid was rendered unlikely by the observation that the product of PAP action on DOPA (DOG) was largely ineffective. Furthermore, propranolol, an inhibitor of PAP, did not diminish the effect of DOPA. With regard to the possibility that lysophosphatidic acid was the active agent, this seems improbable because the addition of this lipid to HT 1080 cells did not affect MMP-9 secretion. 3B.-T. Williger, and J. H. Exton, unpublished observations. Finally, we describe here the characterization of a new model system for the study of Golgi-dependent secretion. In comparison with other methods, the assay of MMP-9 secretion is quick and convenient. It offers an easier and faster way for studying membrane vesiculation and trafficking in response to extracellular signals. Unlike most other methods, it does not require cell permeabilization, virus infection, or any other stressful procedure. Therefore, the cells are in a more physiological state providing information that is as valid as possible in a tissue culture experiment.

https://openalex.org/W2086581082,"A ribonuclease protection assay was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) for the binding of various RNAs by wheat germ EF-1α·GTP. Aminoacylated fully modified tRNAs and unmodified tRNA transcripts of four specificities (valyl, methionyl, alanyl, and phenylalanyl) from higher plants or Escherichia coli were bound with K d values between 0.8 and 10 nm. A valylated 3′-fragment of turnip yellow mosaic virus RNA, which has a pseudoknotted amino acid acceptor stem, was bound with affinity similar to that of Val-tRNAVal. Uncharged tRNA and initiator Met-tRNAMet from wheat germ, RNAs that are normally excluded from the ribosomal A site in vivo, bound weakly. The discrimination against wheat germ initiator Met-tRNAMet was almost entirely due to the 2′-phosphoribosyl modification at nucleotide G64, since removal resulted in tight binding by EF-1α·GTP. A 44-nucleotide RNA representing a kinked acceptor/T arm obtained by in vitroselection to bacterial EF-Tu formed an Ala-RNA·EF-1α·GTP complex with a K d of 29 nm, indicating that much of the binding affinity for aminoacylated tRNA is derived from interaction with the acceptor/T half of the molecule. The pattern of tRNA interaction observed for EF-1α (eEF1A) therefore closely resembles that of bacterial EF-Tu (EF1A).

The pattern of tRNA interaction observed for EF-1α (eEF1A) therefore closely resembles that of bacterial EF-Tu (EF1A). The translational elongation factors EF-1α (eEF1A) 1New names for EF-1α and EF-Tu (eEF1A and EF1A, respectively) are being adopted by IUPAC and IUBMB. 1New names for EF-1α and EF-Tu (eEF1A and EF1A, respectively) are being adopted by IUPAC and IUBMB. and EF-Tu (EF1A) are GTP-binding proteins that serve similar roles in protein synthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. Their normal role is to deliver aminoacylated tRNAs into the A site of the ribosome. While dispensing this function for tRNAs carrying all the standard 20 amino acids (including methionine) that are elongationally inserted into proteins, elongation factors must discriminate against non-aminoacylated tRNAs and against the methionylated initiator tRNAMet that is loaded into the ribosomal P site by initiation factors. The basis for these functions is well understood in bacterial systems, for which extensive ligand binding and structural studies have been performed. The reported equilibrium dissociation constants for the interactions of Escherichia coli EF-Tu·GTP with aminoacylated elongator tRNAs fall between 0.2 and 7 nm(1Louie A. Jurnak F.

Acta. 1990; 1050: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) range when determined in a single set of experiments. These tight associations forming aminoacyl-tRNA·EF-Tu·GTP ternary complexes contrast strongly with the weak affinity of E. coli EF-Tu·GTP for uncharged tRNA (K d = 2.6–2.8 μm; Ref.3Janiak F. Dell V.A. Abrahamson J.K. Watson B.S. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4268-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The 2250-fold weaker affinity for tRNAPhe lacking the esterified phenylalanyl moiety (3Janiak F. Dell V.A. Abrahamson J.K. Watson B.S. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4268-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) effectively prevents uncharged tRNA from reaching the ribosomal A site unless the normal aminoacylation status of cellular tRNAs is severely impaired. A considerably smaller binding differential exists in the case of methionylated initiator tRNAMet; the K d values for binding elongator methionyl-tRNAMet and initiator formylmethionyl-tRNAMet were reported as 1.8 and 136 nm, respectively (3Janiak F. Dell V.A. Abrahamson J.K. Watson B.S. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4268-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a 76-fold difference. Exclusion of initiator formylmethionyl-tRNAMet from the A site thus relies only partially on EF-Tu·GTP discrimination, but also on A site competition by elongator methionyl-tRNAMet·EF-Tu·GTP ternary complex, complex formation with IF2·GTP, and selective interaction of initiator tRNA with the ribosomal P site (5RajBhandary U.L. Chow C.M. Söll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 511-528Google Scholar). The recently solved crystal structure of the phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe·EF-Tu·GTP complex fromThermus aquaticus (6Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F.C. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) has shown that the protein contacts the aminoacyl-tRNA only in the acceptor/T half of the tRNA molecule. Accordingly, aminoacylated tRNA half-molecules and tRNAs lacking the anticodon domain have been reported to bind Thermus thermophilus EF-Tu·GTP with affinities similar to those of the parental tRNAs (7Rudinger J. Blechschmidt B. Ribeiro S. Sprinzl M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5682-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Nazarenko I.A. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The overall similarity of EF-1α function to that of EF-Tu (see,e.g., Refs. 9Richter D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Ravel J.M. Dawkins R.C. Lax S. Odom O.W. Hardesty B. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1984; 234: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) has been convincingly established by the interchangeability of EF-Tu and EF-1α in binding to, although not in supporting protein synthesis by, bacterial and mammalian ribosomes (12Grasmuk H. Nolan R.D. Drews J. FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). EF-1α, like EF-Tu, has been shown to form ternary complexes with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA (9Richter D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Ravel J.M. Dawkins R.C. Lax S. Odom O.W. Hardesty B. Arch. Biochem.

However, in contrast to the rich information available for EF-Tu, quantitative data on the interaction of EF-1α with tRNAs are almost non-existent. The only estimate for the stability of aminoacyl-tRNA·EF-1α·GTP ternary complex we have found in the literature is one of “about 10 nm” for Phe-tRNA (11Carvalho M.G.C. Carvalho J.F. Merrick W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the extent of binding discrimination against uncharged tRNA is not known. With regard to the exclusion of initiator methionyl-tRNAMet from the A site of eukaryotic ribosomes, it has been shown that a 2′-phosphoribosyl modification of the purine at position 64 of the yeast and wheat germ initiator tRNAs is an important antideterminant of interaction with EF-1α·GTP (14Förster C. Chakraburtty K. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Kiesewetter S. Ott G. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4677-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After removal of this modification, both tRNAs could serve as elongators in in vitro protein synthesis (15Kiesewetter S. Ott G. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4677-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); in the yeast case, the demodified methionyl-tRNA showed an increased ability to enter ternary complex with EF-1α·GTP (14Förster C. Chakraburtty K. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), although no dissociation constants were reported. In order to improve our understanding of the detailed function of EF-1α in eukaryotic protein synthesis, we have studied the binding of wheat germ EF-1α·GTP to various charged and uncharged RNAs. Our results emphasize the similarity in the RNA binding properties of higher eukaryotic EF-1α·GTP to those of its bacterial homologue EF-Tu·GTP. Mature tRNAPhe fromE. coli strain MRE600 was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, total wheat germ tRNA was purchased from Sigma, and purified yeast initiator tRNAMet was a gift from Drs. C. Florentz and R. Giegé (Institut de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France). Mature tRNAVal, and initiator and elongator tRNAsMet were purified from total wheat germ tRNA by hybridization affinity using a procedure based on those of Tsuruiet al. (16Tsurui H. Kumazawa Y. Sanokawa R. Watanabe Y. Kuroda T. Wada A. Watanabe K. Shirai T. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Mörl et al. (17Mörl M. Dörner M. Pääbo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3380-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 3′-Biotinylated deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to the 30 nucleotides upstream and including the discriminator base (nucleotide 73) were synthesized by automated chemistry; these oligomers were based on the sequences of higher plant tRNAVal (lupine; Ref. 18Barciszewska M. Jones D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), elongator tRNAMet (wheat germ; Ref. 19Barciszewska M. Dirheimer G. Keith G. Biochem. Biophys Res.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 3241-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). About 15 μg of each tRNA was obtained from 4 mg of total tRNA. Purity was assessed by 3′-labeling with [5′-32P]cytidine bisphosphate and T4 RNA ligase (21England T.E. Bruce A.G. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and analysis of ribonuclease T1 digestion products by 20% sequencing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; no products apart from those expected from the selected sequence were observed (data not shown). All other tRNAs were generated in vitro by transcription with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 10 mm 5′-GMP and 1 mm GTP to produce 5′-monophosphate termini (22Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). RNAs were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8%), recovered by electroelution, and dialyzed against water. Transcriptional templates were either plasmid DNAs linearized at aBstNI restriction site coincident with the 3′-CCA, or DNA amplified in vitro by polymerase chain reaction (23Tsai C.-H. Dreher T.W. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 58-61PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid templates were used to make unmodified lupine tRNAVal (synthetic clone pTVAL, which encodes tRNAVal with a CAC anticodon in place of the modified IAC (I = inosine) of the mature tRNA), E. colitRNAAla and short derivatives thereof (8Nazarenko I.A. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and wheat germ elongator tRNAMet (24Dreher T.W. Tsai C.-H. Skuzeski J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RNA, was made by transcription with T7 RNA polymerase from BstNI-linearized plasmid DNA as described (25Dreher T.W. Florentz C. Giegé R. Biochimie (Paris). 1988; 70: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). RNAs (30–50 pmol) were preparatively aminoacylated with appropriate radiolabeled amino acids and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The completed reactions were acidified by adjusting to 75 mm sodium acetete (pH 5.2), deproteinized with phenol/chloroform equilibrated to pH 5.2 with sodium acetate solution, and ethanol–precipitated. After recovery by centrifugation, the valylated RNAs were redissolved in 5 mmsodium acetate (pH 5.2) and stored at −80 °C until use. The plant tRNAs, yeast initiator tRNAMet, and the viral TYSma RNA were aminoacylated with activities present in a partially purified wheat germ extract (26Dreher T.W. Tsai C.-H. Florentz C. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 91839189Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), in TM buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm spermine) containing 10 μm[3H]valine (47.2 Ci/mmol), 10 μm[3H]alanine (50 Ci/mmol), or 10 μm[35S]methionine (350–1200 Ci/mmol) at 30 °C. E. coli tRNAPhe was aminoacylated with [3H]phenylalanine (136 Ci/mmol), and E. colitRNAAla and its short derivatives were aminoacylated with [3H]alanine (50 Ci/mmol) using purified recombinantE. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as described (8Nazarenko I.A. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Purified wheat germ EF-1α (27Lax S.R. Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was activated by incubation with 20 μm GTP in EF buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mmNH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) plus 25% (v/v) glycerol at 30 °C for 20 min. Various concentrations (0–250 nm) of EF-1α·GTP were incubated together in multiwell strips (Nunc) with valylated RNAs (0.2–5 nm) in EF buffer containing 12.5% glycerol and 0.5 mg/ml fragmented salmon sperm DNA on ice for 15 min (after Ref. 13Nagata S. Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in 20 μl reactions. The amounts of ternary complex were estimated with a ribonuclease protection/ trichloroacetic acid filter precipitation assay adapted from Louie et al. (4Louie A. Ribeiro N.S. Reid B.R. Jurnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5010-5016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were terminated by addition of 4 μl of ice-cold 5 mg/ml ribonuclease A (Sigma) and incubation for 15 s before quenching the ribonuclease activity with the further addition of 4 μl of 50 mg/ml tRNA or total torula RNA (Sigma). Total reaction mixtures were then immediately pipetted onto dried 1-cm filter paper squares (3MM, Whatman) impregnated with 20% trichloroacetic acid containing 2 mmof the appropriate amino acid, and immediately plunged into excess 10% trichloroacetic acid to be held on ice for at least 5 min. After several washes with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 95% ethanol, the dried filters were subjected to counting in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) were calculated from binding curves comprising data from 14 concentrations of EF-1α·GTP. Each binding assay was performed in duplicate, and repeated at least twice. The concentration of active EF-1α·GTP present in binding experiments was determined by binding in the presence of excess [3H]Val-tRNAValtranscript. Aminoacyl-tRNA·EF-1α·GTP ternary complex formation follows Equation 1. Kd=[free aa­tRNA][free EF­1α·GTP][aa­tRNA·EF­1α·GTP]Equation 1 In terms of total concentrations of aminoacylated tRNA (t) and EF-1α·GTP (e), and defining the concentration of ternary complex as c, this equation becomesK d = ((t −c)(e − c))/c, which can be rearranged to c 2 −c(t + e + Kd) +t·e = 0. Solution for c, the quantity assayed in the binding reaction, by means of the general quadratic equation yields c = ((t +e + Kd) ± √((t + e + Kd)2 − 4t·e))/2. The plotting program KaleidaGraph (Adelbeck Software) was used to solve the plot of c (filter cpm) versus e, yielding K d, t, and the yintercept representing the level of background counts. Note that, in practice, t (total concentration of charged tRNA competent to enter ternary complex) is an unknown quantity, since not all the aminoacyl-tRNA is capable of forming ternary complexes, presumably due to denaturation. Typically, 80–95% of aminoacylated tRNAs were bound, but in some instances lower proportions of charged tRNAs were competent for binding (see Tables II and III).Table IIThe interaction of wheat germ EF-1α·GTP with elongator and initiator tRNAMetMet-tRNAMetK dFraction of Met-tRNA boundaThe fraction bound represents the proportion of input Met-tRNA bound at the highest concentration of EF-1α·GTP.

Open table in a new tab The plotted equation incorporated a specific activity constant converting tc filter cpm to moles. This specific activity constant was determined by assaying 3H- or35S-labeled aminoacylated tRNA immediately after desalting with a Sephadex G50 spin column. Counts (cpm) from direct counting in scintillation fluid at known efficiency were compared with counts obtained after taking an aliquot of the labeled tRNA in 20 μl of binding buffer through a mock assay termination procedure (including addition of RNA and spotting onto filter paper). This specific activity measurement thus included adjustment for losses during transfer to the filter paper and from incomplete precipitation onto the paper. Assays were performed as above, except that all EF-1α·GTP concentrations were represented in triplicate, and two binding curves for the [35S]methionyl-tRNAMet transcript were performed in parallel in the presence and absence of unlabeled competitor RNA. The same quadratic function used for fitting standard binding curves gave a good fit to the data determined in the presence of competitor RNA (similar chi-square value), and was used as an approximation of the extremely complex function describing the competition. The difference in K d estimated in the presence and absence of competitor (“K doffset”), which represents the concentration of competitor RNA·EF-1α·GTP complex when the reporter is half-bound, was then used to calculate the K d for the competitor RNA. Equation 1 applied to the competitor RNA is shown by Equation 1a; when the reporter is half-bound, [free EF-1α·GTP] =K d (reporter), this latter term being determined in the binding assay lacking competitor. Kd(comp.)=[free comp.RNA][free EF­1α·GTP][comp.RNA·EF­1α·GTP]Equation 1a Thus, the above equation becomes Equation 2. Kd(comp.)={[total comp.RNA]−Kdoffset}Kd(reporter)KdoffsetEquation 2 The competition binding assay was compared with the direct assay by determining the K d for a [3H]valylated viral RNA both ways (data not shown). The direct assay yielded K d = 2.9 ± 0.5 nm, while the competition assay yieldedK d values of 1.5 and 2.0 nm in two runs. The similarity of these estimates validates the competition assay. Periodate oxidation and ribose removal by β-elimination were performed on wheat germ and yeast initiator tRNAMet as described (15Kiesewetter S. Ott G. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4677-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), except that the reaction products were not subjected to chromatographic purification. The treatment results in loss of the phosphoribosyl modification of nucleotide 64 as well as removal of the 3′ nucleotide. Demodification was judged complete, since the 3′ nucleotides were shown after 3′-labeling to have been quantitatively removed. The treated tRNAs were methionylated by a wheat germ methionyl-tRNA synthetase activity in the presence of (CTP,ATP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, which is able to regenerate the eliminated 3′-A residue. A ribonuclease protection assay based on that described for the EF-Tu studies of Louie et al. (4Louie A. Ribeiro N.S. Reid B.R. Jurnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5010-5016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was developed to measure the dissociation constants for the interactions between EF-1α·GTP and various aminoacylated tRNAs. This assay relies on the protection of the RNA bearing an amino acid labeled with 3H or35S against ribonucleolytic degradation that occurs when the RNA is bound by EF-1α. To make the technique more convenient, cheaper, and more accessible to RNAs available in limited quantities, the binding reactions were reduced in size to 20 μl. This permitted the entire reaction to be spotted onto paper filters at the end of the assay, avoiding cumbersome filtration. After treatment with the high levels of ribonuclease A necessary to digest unprotected phosphodiester bonds within 15 s on ice, rapid quenching of the ribonuclease was needed to prevent further digestion while the RNA was precipitated onto filter paper squares. This was achieved by addition of ice-cold RNA, rapid spotting onto filter paper that had been dried after impregnation with 20% trichloroacetic acid, and immediate addition to a 10% trichloroacetic acid bath held on ice. To permit binding assays at subnanomolar concentrations of aminoacylated tRNA, necessary when using [35S]methionyl-tRNAMet as a reporter in competition binding assays (see below), fragmented salmon sperm DNA (0.5 mg/ml) was included in all binding reactions in order to prevent adsorptive losses of labeled RNA to the plastic walls of the incubation vessel. Representative binding curves of four of the aminoacylated RNAs studied are shown in Fig. 1, and the dissociation constants determined from at least three replicates are reported in Table I. The tRNAs assayed were of four specificities (valine, methionine, alanine, and phenylalanine), and included tRNAs of higher plant or bacterial origin; the tRNAs were either fully modified mature tRNAs purified from cells, or in vitro transcripts lacking post-transcriptional modifications but with the natural 5′-GMP termini. The dissociation constants measured for the aminoacylated tRNAs varied between about 1 and 10 nm. Only small differences in binding affinity were observed between the fully modified and unmodified forms of plant tRNAVal and tRNAMet (both forms were derived from the same gene in the case of tRNAMet). No significant difference was observed between the binding affinities of the plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) and bacterial (E. coli) tRNAAla transcripts (5.3 versus 6.5 nm). Both alanyl-tRNA and phenylalanyl-tRNA were bound considerably less tightly than valyl-tRNA and methionyl-tRNA. The rather narrow range in the dissociation constants of the aminoacylated tRNAs studied in Table I (12-fold) indicates a capacity for wheat germ EF-1α·GTP to form tight complexes with tRNAs of widely differing sequences. Despite varying primary sequence, however, tRNAs all share very similar L-shaped tertiary conformations. Different structural motifs (a pseudoknotted amino acid acceptor stem; Refs.28Rietveld K.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 303-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Joshi R.L. Ravel J.M. Haenni A.-L. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although dissociation constants for these interactions have never been reported. TYMV RNA has a 3′-terminal 82-nucleotide-long tRNA-like structure that can be aminoacylated with valine (26Dreher T.W. Tsai C.-H. Florentz C. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 91839189Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Pinck M. Yot P. Chapeville F. Duranton H.M. Nature. 1970; 226: 954-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To assess the affinity of EF-1α for pseudoknotted RNA, we prepared 264-nucleotide-long TYSma transcripts (25Dreher T.W. Florentz C. Giegé R. Biochimie (Paris). 1988; 70: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that included the tRNA-like structure shown in Fig.2, and assayed the binding affinity of the valylated RNA to wheat germ EF-1α·GTP. The dissociation constant (1.9 nm; Table I) measured for the valylated viral RNA was comparable to that of the unmodified valyl-tRNAValtranscript (2.3 nm), indicating a capacity for EF-1α·GTP to form tight complexes with RNAs of varying acceptor stem architecture. Tight complex formation was dependent on EF-1α activation and was not observed for EF-1α·GDP, and valylated viral RNA competed with valylated tRNAVal for binding by EF-1α·GTP (data not shown). These observations confirm that the valylated viral RNA was bound by the same binding surface as aminoacyl-tRNA. The high specific activity labeling achievable for tRNA aminoacylated with [35S]methionine made this an excellent reporter species in a competition variant of the standard assay, permitting a study of the affinity of wheat germ EF-1α·GTP for uncharged wheat germ tRNA. The addition of 10 μm uncharged wheat germ tRNA to 0.47 nm [35S]methionyl-tRNAMettranscript resulted in a slightly weakened apparent binding affinity of the reporter methionyl-tRNAMet. The calculatedK d of 15.2 ± 6.3 μm for the uncharged tRNA (Table I) means that the affinity of EF-1α·GTP for uncharged tRNA is 103-fold to 104-fold weaker than for charged tRNA. Mature initiator tRNAMet and elongator tRNAMet were purified by a hybridization affinity method from total wheat germ tRNA. 3′-Labeling with 32P revealed no detectable cross-contamination of signature oligonucleotides generated by ribonuclease T1 between these two tRNAMet preparations (data not shown). In contrast to the tight binding of elongator [35S]methionyl-tRNAMet (K d= 0.83 nm; Table I), initiator [35S]methionyl-tRNAMet bound weakly to EF-1α·GTP. At accessible concentrations of EF-1α·GTP, the binding curves were incomplete, preventing relia"
https://openalex.org/W1918972798,"With the electro-driven import of rhodamine 123, we used single cell fluorescence microscopy to single out the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) in controlling mitochondrial membrane potential expressed by (stationary growing) rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma cells in culture. The experimental design and the computer-aided image analysis detected and quantitated variations of fluorescence signals specific to mitochondria. We observed that 1) the two cell lines display changes of fluorescence dependent on mitochondrial energization states; 2) mitochondrial fluorescence decreases after exposure of the cells to a NO releaser; 4) the different fluorescence intensity measured under stationary growing conditions, or after activation and inhibition of constitutive NO synthase, is consistent with a steady-state production of NO. Direct comparison of single cell fluorescence with bulk cytofluorimetry proved that the results obtained by the latter method may be misleading because of the intrinsic-to-measure lack of information about distribution of fluorescence within different cell compartments. The kinetic parameters describing the reactions between cytochrome oxidase, NO, and O2 may account for the puzzling (20-fold) increase of the KM for O2 reported for cells and tissues as compared to purified cytochrome c oxidase, allowing an estimate of in vivo NO flux.—Sarti, P., Lendaro, E., Ippoliti, R., Bellelli, A., Benedetti, P.

https://openalex.org/W2033160367,"The regulation of glycogen synthesis and associated enzymes was studied in human myoblasts and myotubes maintained in culture. Both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis approximately 2-fold, this stimulation being accompanied by a rapid and stable activation of the controlling enzyme glycogen synthase (GS). EGF also caused inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) and activation of the α isoform of protein kinase B (PKB) with the time-course and magnitude of its effects being similar to those induced by insulin. An inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway did not prevent stimulation of GS by EGF, suggesting that this pathway is not essential for the effect. A partial decrease in the fold activation of GS was, however, observed when p70<sup>S6k</sup> activation was blocked with rapamycin, suggesting a contribution of this pathway to the control of GS by either hormone. Wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI-3 kinase) completely blocked the effects of both EGF and insulin in these cells. These results demonstrate that EGF, like insulin, activates glycogen synthesis in muscle, acting principally via the PKB/GSK-3 pathway but with a contribution from a rapamycin-sensitive component that lies downstream of PI-3 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2004246358,"The signaling pathway mediating the contractile effect of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-AR) in the heart is still matter of debate. By using embryonic chick ventricular cardiomyocytes that express both functional β1-and β2-ARs, we show here that the specific β2-AR agonist, zinterol, increases the amplitude of Ca2+ transients and cell contraction of electrically stimulated cells. Zinterol, up to 10 μm, did not stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, and its effect on Ca2+transients was unmodified by the specific cAMP antagonist, (Rp)-cAMPS. In contrast, zinterol (10–100 nm) triggered arachidonic acid (AA) release from [3H]AA-loaded cells via the activation of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Stimulation of the Ca2+ transients by zinterol was abolished by the cPLA2 inhibitor, AACOCF3, and was mimicked by AA (0.3–3 μm). Both stimulations of [3H]AA release and of [Ca2+]i cycling by zinterol were abolished after treatment of the cardiomyocytes with pertussis toxin. Although cell responses to β2-AR stimulation were mediated by AA, they were under cAMP control as follows: (i) the β1-AR stimulation exerted a cAMP-mediated negative constraint on the β2-AR/cPLA2 pathway; (ii) cAMP potentiated AA action downstream β-AR stimulation. We conclude that, in cardiomyocytes, β2-AR is coupled to cPLA2 activation via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. These results demonstrate the involvement of the cPLA2/AA pathway in mediating positive inotropic effects, which could potentially compensate for a defective cAMP pathway.

However, their relative amount and their respective participation in the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline vary depending on the cardiac tissue, the animal species, and/or the pathophysiological state (1Brodde O.E.

Ther. 1997; 283: 452-461PubMed Google Scholar). In the non-failing human left ventricle, β1-ARs represent 80% of the total β-ARs but mediate about 60% only of β-adrenergic-induced ventricular contractility (3Bristow M.R. Ginsburg R. Umans V.

In the human failing heart, the β1/β2-AR ratio decreases, and the contribution of β2-AR to the contractile responses becomes predominant over that of β1-AR, in particular at low adrenaline concentrations (3Bristow M.R.

For these reasons, the potential role of β2-AR for improving cardiac performance has received considerable attention. In fact, the myocardial-targeted overexpression of β2-ARs in transgenic mice significantly enhanced myocardial left ventricular contractility (5Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C.

It is well documented that β1-AR and β2-AR subtypes are coupled to adenylyl cyclase activation and that stimulation of both receptors generally leads to an increase in cellular cAMP (4Del Monte F.

Furthermore, in a recent study, we have demonstrated that glucagon action relies not only on cAMP but also on the synergistic support of AA, by activation of the cPLA2 which hydrolyzes thesn-2 fatty acyl ester bonds of membranous phospholipids (15Sauvadet A.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the respective role of cAMP and AA in the cardiac response to β-adrenergic agonists. We used the model of embryonic chick ventricular cardiomyocytes that has been widely exploited for studies on metabolism, contractile physiology, electrophysiology, and examination of pathophysiologic states such as ischemia (19Marsh J.D. Smith T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 10-18PubMed Google Scholar). We show that those cells, in addition to expressing β1-AR (19Marsh J.D. Smith T.W. Mol.

We compared the β1- and β2-AR-mediated effects on adenylyl cyclase, [Ca2+]i transients, cell contraction, and AA release. Our results demonstrate that cAMP is the messenger of β1-AR responses. In contrast, cell responses to β2-AR stimulation were mediated by AA but under cAMP control. Zinterol and CGP 20712A were kindly supplied by Squibb and CIBA-Geigy (Basel, Switzerland), respectively. Mini-glucagon was obtained from ICN (Orsay, France). (Rp)-cAMPS, H89, HELSS, and AACOCF3 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Penicillin/streptomycin, antibiotic solution, trypsin, nucleotides, (±)-isoproterenol, bovine serum albumin, arachidonic acid, ICI 118551, and pertussis toxin were obtained from Sigma (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France).

Primary monolayer cultured heart cells were prepared from 13-day-old chick embryo ventricles as described previously (15Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were dissociated by repeated cycles of trypsinization. The resulting cell suspension (5–7 × 105 cells/ml) was bubbled with 5% CO2, 95% air, at 4 °C, and kept in buffer A (M199 medium containing 0.1% (w/v) NaHCO3, 0.01% (w/v)l-glutamine, 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic solution) until used, up to 5 days. Cells were plated on plastic dishes, the bottom of which was replaced by a glass coverslip coated with laminin (1 μg/ml), and were incubated at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air for 17–24 h. Cells, attached to laminin, were bathed in 2 ml of saline buffer B (10 mm glucose, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes buffered at pH 7.4 with Tris base, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2) and were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with 1.5 μmFura-2/AM (3 μl of 1 mm Fura-2/AM in Me2SO), in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to improve Fura-2 dispersion and facilitate cell loading. Cells were then washed with saline buffer B (2 × 2 ml) and allowed to incubate in the same buffer for 15 min at 25 °C to facilitate hydrolysis of intracellular Fura-2/AM. The concentration of Fura-2 in myocytes was estimated as described previously (15Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25864-25872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under usual loading conditions, the average intracellular concentration of Fura-2 was 15 μm. Ca2+ imaging, developed by A. Trautman in collaboration with the IMSTAR (Paris, France), was essentially as described by Sauvadet et al. (21Sauvadet A. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Field electrical stimulation (square waves, 10-ms duration, amplitude 20% above threshold, 0.5 Hz) was supplied through a pair of platinum electrodes connected to the output of an HAMEG stimulator (Paris, France). Cells were perifused with saline buffer B containing 2 mm CaCl2 and stimulated until a steady-state level of the Ca2+transients was achieved, before addition of drugs and peptides to the perfusion medium. Experiments were performed in conditions similar to Ca2+ imaging, but cells were illuminated with visible light and images transmitted through a solid-state camera (CCD, black and white, 0.847-cm high sensitivity) connected to the sideport of the microscope, as described previously (15Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12437-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Contractions of single stimulated (0.5 Hz) myocytes were displayed on a video monitor, and the corresponding images (pixel × pixel) were recorded at a frequency of 9/s. Contractility measurements were determined by assessing changes in cell length using the Morphostar II software, developed by the IMSTAR (Paris, France). A particulate fraction of embryonic chick ventricular cardiomyocytes was obtained from cells washed twice in saline buffer B, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured as described previously (24Brechler V. Pavoine C. Hanf R. Garbarz E.

The assay medium contained, in a final volume of 60 μl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm [α-32P]ATP (106cpm), 1 mm [8-3H]cAMP (20,000 cpm), 50 μm GTP, 0.2 mm methylisobutylxanthine, 25 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mg/ml creatine kinase. The incubation was initiated by the addition of 20–70 μg of proteins and run at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.2 ml of 0.5n HCl. Samples were boiled for 6 min and thereafter buffered with 0.2 ml of 1.5 m imidazole. [32P]cAMP formed was separated from [32P]ATP by chromatography on alumina columns according to the procedure of White (25White A.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Results were obtained from triplicate determinations. Embryonic chick ventricular cardiomyocytes (5 × 105 cells/ml), suspended in buffer A, were plated in 24-well plates, left for 24 h in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air, at 37 °C, and then incubated with 1.5 μCi/ml [3H]AA (6.75 nm). After 24 h incubation with [3H]AA, the cells were washed twice in saline buffer B containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and resuspended in saline buffer B. At time 0 of the experiment, [3H]AA-labeled cells were exposed to various peptides and/or enzymatic inhibitors and incubated for various periods at 37 °C. Incubation was terminated by the addition of ice-cold EGTA (2 mm final), and the media were immediately transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifugation at 17,600 × gfor 20 min in a Sigma centrifuge (model 2K15) at 4 °C was performed to pellet any cells or debris inadvertently collected with the extracellular medium. The amount of radioactivity in the supernatant was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Analysis of the lipids released in the incubation medium was performed as described (26Matzuoka I. Nakanishi H. Thromb. Res. 1985; 37: 185-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation period, the reaction mixture was acidified to pH 3.0 with HCl, and the products were extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The dried extracts were dissolved in ethanol/chloroform (1:2, v/v) and chromatographed on silica gel thin layer plate (Whatman LK5) in ethyl acetate/isooctane/water/acetic acid (11:5:10:2, v/v) as the solvent system. Standard concentrations of AA, prostaglandins E, and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids were co-chromatographed and visualized by exposing the plates to ultraviolet light. The area corresponding to each visualized spot was carefully extracted, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The effect of increasing concentrations of isoproterenol was examined on [Ca2+]i cycling of electrically stimulated embryonic chick ventricular myocytes. A dose-dependent increase in the amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients was observed, reaching a maximal (210 ± 9%) stimulation at 1–10 μm isoproterenol (Fig. 1). Preincubation for 10 min with 100 nm of the selective β2-AR antagonist, ICI 118551 (7Kaumann A.J. Lemoine H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1987; 335: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), significantly reduced the stimulation evoked by 10 μm isoproterenol (26% inhibition) but was poorly effective in inhibiting the effect of lower concentrations. In contrast, 300 nm of the selective β1-AR antagonist, CGP 20712A (7Kaumann A.J. Lemoine H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1987; 335: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), markedly blocked the effect of low isoproterenol concentrations, leading to a rightward-shifted dose-response curve of isoproterenol effect. CGP 20712A also reduced by 54% the maximal effect of 10 μmisoproterenol (Fig. 1). It thus appeared that isoproterenol behaved as a β1-AR agonist at concentrations below 100 nm, and as a mixed β1/β2-AR agonist in the micromolar range of concentrations. Zinterol, a specific, partial β2-AR agonist (8Waelbroeck M. Taton G. Delhaye M. Chatelain P. Camus J.C. Pochet R. Leclerc J.L. De Smet J.M. Robberecht P. Christophe J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 174-182PubMed Google Scholar, 27Xiao R.P. Lakatta E.G. Endoh M. Morad M. Scholtz H. Iijima T. Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Regulation. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo, 1996: 291-316Crossref Google Scholar), elicited a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i transient amplitude of electrically stimulated embryonic chick cardiomyocytes (Fig.2 A). A maximal, 144 ± 3%, increase was observed at 30 nm zinterol, with a half-maximal response occurring at 10 nm zinterol. As illustrated by the typical traces of [Ca2+]itransients (Fig. 2 B), the effect of zinterol was reversed by 100 nm of the selective β2-AR antagonist, ICI 118551, but was not affected by 300 nm of the selective β1-AR antagonist, CGP 20712A (Fig. 2 B). Both β1- and β2-AR stimulatory effects on [Ca2+]i cycling were correlated with increases in the amplitude of cell contraction; 30 nm zinterol (β2-AR agonist) and 100 nm isoproterenol (at a concentration at which the agonist functioned as a β1-AR agonist) increased the amplitude of cell contraction by 80 and 150% over basal, respectively (Fig.3, A and B). Furthermore, as shown in the normalized and superimposed tracings of contraction (Fig. 3 C), zinterol, like isoproterenol, markedly accelerated the kinetics of relaxation. The effects of zinterol and isoproterenol on adenylyl cyclase activity were examined in a particulate fraction of embryonic chick ventricular myocytes. Isoproterenol, at 10 μm, elicited a maximal 1.8-fold stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, the half-maximal effect being obtained at 0.15 μm isoproterenol (Fig.4 A). This effect was totally blocked by 300 nm of the β1-AR antagonist, CGP 20712A. Under the same assay conditions, zinterol had no effect on adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 4 A). These results suggest that, in embryonic chick ventricular cardiomyocytes, adenylyl cyclase is specifically coupled to β1-ARs but not to β2-ARs. To analyze further cAMP dependence of [Ca2+]i cycling modulations in response to β2- and β1-AR stimulations, we used the cell-permeable selective cAMP antagonist, (Rp)-cAMPS, (28Bell D. McDermott B.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1994; 26: 1439-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Following preincubation for 1 h with 10 μm(Rp)-cAMPS, the increase in amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients in response to 300 nm prenalterol, a specific β1-AR agonist, was reduced by 83% (from 142 ± 7 to 107 ± 1% of control amplitude, Fig. 4 B). The cAMP antagonist produced a similar reduction in the β1-AR-mediated effect of 100 nm isoproterenol (from 178 ± 9 to 118 ± 3%, Fig. 4 B). In contrast, (Rp)-cAMPS failed to inhibit the β2-AR response to either zinterol (30 nm) or fenoterol (100 nm) (Fig. 4 B). These findings demonstrate that adenylyl cyclase and cAMP govern β1-AR agonist-induced stimulation of [Ca2+]i cycling but are not involved in β2-AR-mediated effects. The next series of experiments was performed to assess the possible involvement of AA in mediating β2-AR effects. Embryonic chick ventricular myocytes were labeled for 24 h with [3H]AA before the addition of agonist. As shown in Fig. 5 A,zinterol evoked a dose-dependent release of [3H]AA, which reached a maximal (147 ± 4%) increase with 30 nm zinterol, the half-maximal effects occurring at 5 nm zinterol (Fig. 5 A). The β1-AR agonist prenalterol, as well as isoproterenol ≤100 nm, when functioning in the β1-AR mode, had no effect on [3H]AA release (Fig. 5 A). Only at concentrations above 1 μm did isoproterenol, functioning in the mixed β1/β2-AR mode, evoke a limited, 10% increase over basal in AA release. Resolution on thin layer chromatography (TLC) of the3H-labeled material, released in cell supernatants, identified [3H]AA as the major product, both in control and zinterol-treated cells (75 and 79%, respectively) (TableI). Non-enzymatic degradation or contaminants of standard [3H]AA represented 4–19% of the total radioactivity recovered in supernatants; lipoxygenase and cycloxygenase products represented 4–24 and 1–8%, respectively (Table I).Table IIdentification of 3H-labeled metabolites in supernatants of cells prelabeled with [3H]AAMetabolitesBasal conditions10 μmAACOCF3Migration of standard [3H]AAControlZinterolControlZinteroldpm%dpm%dpm%dpm%%Arachidonic acid1,833(75)3,788(79)2,053(55)2,798(61)89Lipoxygenase products (HETE15, HETE13, and HETE15)188(8Waelbroeck M.

Standard [3H]AA was migrated in parallel in order to determine the nonenzymatic breakdown of AA. HETE, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Since AA formation in the heart is essentially attributed to PLA2 activity, we examined the effect of AACOCF3, a specific inhibitor of the cPLA2. The addition of 10 μm AACOCF3 to the perfusion medium dramatically reduced [3H]AA release evoked by zinterol (from 206 to 136% of control [3H]AA release, Table I). This inhibitory effect correlated with a blockade of the stimulatory effects on [Ca2+]i transients of both specific β2-AR agonists zinterol and fenoterol (Fig.5 B). In contrast, AACOCF3 did not affect the β1-AR-mediated increase in [Ca2+]icycling triggered by either prenalterol or isoproterenol at 100 nm (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, these findings further supported the notion that β2-AR stimulation elicited AA release by stimulating the cPLA2, sensitive to AACOCF3. It may be noted that AACOCF3 completely inhibited β2-AR-mediated effects on [Ca2+]icycling, whereas it had only a partial effect on β2-AR-stimulated AA release (Table I). This may suggest that the onset of the Ca2+ response requires the cellular AA level to reach a threshold. Importantly, exogenous application of micromolar concentrations of AA reproduced the effect of β2-AR agonists on [Ca2+]i transients; at 3 μm, AA evoked a 140% increase in amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients (Fig.6). The activating effect of AA on [Ca2+]i cycling was potentiated by 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 6). Next, we looked for a possible cross-talk between β1- and β2-AR responses. In a first series of experiments, cells were electrically stimulated and exposed to 300 nm of the β1-agonist, prenalterol. The time course of the amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients is illustrated in Fig.7. [Ca2+]itransient amplitude increased for the first minutes of exposure to prenalterol, reaching a maximal 50% increase over basal at 10 min. After 15 min, a decline in stimulation of [Ca2+]icycling occurred, and after 30 min, the β1-AR-mediated effect was no more detectable (Fig. 7). Such a waning of a stimulated response in the face of continuous agonist exposure is typical of"

In this work we have evaluated the requirement of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase kinase (JNKK), and c-Jun/AP-1 activities in transformation and extracellular matrix invasion ofras oncogene expressing NIH 3T3 fibroblasts by expressing stable mutant genes that constitutively inhibit these activities. Whereas the inhibition of ERK activity reverts the transformed and invasive phenotype, the inhibition of the JNK pathway and AP-1trans-activating activities by JNKK[K129R] and c-Jun(TAM67) had no effect on the ability of the rasoncogene-expressing cells to grow in soft agar or invade Matrigel basement membrane. Thus an elevated JNK activity and/or c-Jun/AP-1trans-activating activity are not absolute requirements forras transformation or invasion through basement membrane, and the dependence on AP-1 activity for transformation is cell-specific. However, inhibition of JNK kinase (JNKK) inras-transformed cells with normally elevated JNK activity switches the protease-dependent invasive phenotype from a urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)-dependent to a cathepsin L (CL)-dependent invasive phenotype. Conversely, treatment of ras-transformed cells of low constitutive JNK activity with the JNK stimulator, anisomycin, converts the protease mRNA levels from those characteristic of a CL-dependent to a uPA-dependent phenotype. These protease phenotypes can be duplicated in untransformed NIH 3T3 cells that express platelet-derived growth factor receptors and m1 muscarinic receptors that selectively stimulate the ERK or JNK pathways, respectively. It is concluded that high ERK activity is required for both protease phenotypes, whereas the JNK pathway and c-Jun/AP-1 activity are not required for transformation but regulate a switch between uPA and CL protease phenotypes in both transformed and untransformed cells.

Inhibition of uPA and CL protease gene expressions with antisense oligonucleotides showed that the EJ/vHa-ras-transformed cells metastasized to the nude mouse lung after tail vein injection in a uPA-dependent and CL-independent manner. In contrast to the EJ/vHa-ras cells, NIH 3T3 cells transformed by the RAS1Leudel oncogene showed elevated levels of CL mRNA and secreted CL protease activity but low basal expression of uPA. Selective inhibition of CL and uPA gene expressions with antisense oligonucleotides showed theRAS1Leudel-transformed cells colonized the lung in a CL-dependent and uPA-independent manner. The EJ/vHa-ras-transformed cells were designated aras uPA+/CL− phenotype and theRAS1Leudel-transformed cells a reciprocalras CL+/uPA− phenotype. Based on the observation of the two different protease-dependent metastatic phenotypes(ras uPA+/CL− andras CL+/uPA−) generated by the EJ/vHa-ras and RAS1Leudel oncogenes, it was hypothesized that the different ras isoforms activated different combinations of Ras downstream activities. Analysis of the ERK and JNK pathway activities downstream from Ras showed that in the EJ/vHa-ras-transformed cells of phenotyperas uPA+/CL− both ERK and JNK activities were elevated (21Silberman S. Janulis M. Schultz R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5927-5935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Correlated with the elevated JNK activity, the EJ/vHa-ras-transformed cells showed high levels of c-Jun and hyperphosphorylated c-Jun. TheRAS1Leudel-transformed cells had a constitutively elevated ERK activity, identical in magnitude to the ERK activity in the EJ/vHa-ras-transformed cells. However, in the RAS1Leudel-transformed cells of phenotyperas CL+/uPA−, the JNK activity and c-Jun levels appeared inhibited (JNK activity was ∼30% of the activity in untransformed NIH 3T3 cells) (21Silberman S. Janulis M. Schultz R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5927-5935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When a dominant negative c-Jun, TAM67, was expressed in EJ/vHa-ras-transformed cells of phenotype ras uPA+/CL−, the uPA mRNA levels were decreased to basal, and the CL mRNA levels were elevated to that identical to the level of CL mRNA inRAS1Leudel of phenotyperas CL+/uPA− (21Silberman S. Janulis M. Schultz R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5927-5935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This indicated that c-Jun levels regulate a switch between the uPA- and CL-dependent protease phenotypes, with high levels of c-Jun generating a uPA+/CL− protease phenotype and low levels of c-Jun a CL+/uPA− protease phenotype in the ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. In this paper we show that expression of TAM67 inhibits both wild-type c-Jun expression and total AP-1 trans-activating activity in the ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. However, the cells remain transformed and invasive, as shown by growth in soft agar and invasion through Matrigel basement membrane. This result is surprising, since prior reports in other cell lines showed a requirement for AP-1 activity to maintain the transformed state induced by a rasoncogene (26Johnson R. Spiegelman B.

We also show that inhibition of JNK1 inras-transformed cells by expression of a dominant negative JNKK/SEK similarly has no effect on the ability of the cell to grow in soft agar or invade basement membrane. However, as with the inhibition of c-Jun/AP-1 through TAM67, expression of the mutant JNKK[K129R] in EJ/vHa-ras-transformed cells switches the protease phenotype for invasion from ras uPA+/CL− toras CL+/uPA−. The protease phenotype could be switched in reverse, from ras CL+/uPA− toras uPA+/CL−, by stimulating the intrinsically low JNK activity inRAS1Leudel-transformed cells with the JNK stimulator anisomycin. Finally, the mRNA levels characteristic of the ras CL+/uPA− orras uPA+/CL− phenotypes can be generated in non-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with selective inducers that activate either ERK alone or both ERK and JNK activities, respectively, indicating that a ras oncogene is not required to regulate the switch between CL and uPA expression. A switch in protease expressions in cellular invasions through regulation of JNK or c-Jun activities allows an invasive cell to overcome inhibitors of one class of protease (i.e. serine- or cysteine-type proteases) by switching to the expression of another class of protease.

The c-myc gene is an immediate-early response gene, which is activated in quiescent cells by mitogenic stimuli. c-myc is required for the G0 to G1transition (reviewed in Refs. 1Marcu K.B.

Deregulated overexpression of c-Myc blocks terminal differentiation of a number of cell types. Likewise, cellular differentiation is normally accompanied by a decrease of c-Myc in a variety of cell lines (reviewed in Refs. 1Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev.

Given the opposing actions of Myc-Max and Mad-Max, the cell may alter the activities of E-box-dependent genes by altering the relative levels of Myc and Mad, and this in turn may control proliferation.

Thus, Mxi1/Mad proteins are essential in the regulation of normal and neoplastic growth. The mechanism of inverse expression of the c-myc andmxi1 genes is not known. However, in vivo, c-myc expression ceases in many tissues during terminal differentiation, at the time that the mxi1 gene is activated. The c-myc gene is regulated at multiple levels including repression of transcription (42Krumm A. Hickey L.B. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 43Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 56: 1-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). c-myctranscripts are initiated from two major start sites, P1 and P2, which are separated by 162 base pairs in the human c-myc gene. Because the great majority of c-myc transcripts arise from P2 (43Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 56: 1-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), P2 is a likely target for transcriptional repression. Myc is known to repress its own promoter, providing an autoregulatory loop that limits c-myc transcription (44Grignani F. Lombardi L. Inghirami G. Sternas L. Cechova K. Dalla-Favera R.

In fact, Myc may induce cell proliferation, at least in part, by repressing genes with growth arrest activity (54Hopewell R. Li L. MacGregor D. Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 19S: 85-89Crossref Google Scholar). This repression is opposed by USF, an ubiquitous B-HLH-LZ transcription factor (49Li L.H. Nerlov C. Prendergast G. MacGregor D. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 50Philipp A. Schneider A. Vasrik I. Finke K. Xiong Y. Beach D. Alitalo K. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4032-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The autoregulation of the c-myc promoter may be controlled by a similar Myc-dependent repression mechanism in continuously proliferating cells. However, an autoregulatory mechanism is inherently incapable of the complete shut down of c-myc promoter activity that takes place during terminal differentiation. Thus other mechanisms for c-myc regulation are likely to operate during terminal differentiation. In this report, we show that the Mxi1 protein is a repressor of the c-myc promoter. Mxi1 represses the chromosomal c-myc gene 30-fold, even in the absence of other aspects of terminal differentiation. Repression of c-myc depends on a novel regulatory domain within the Mxi1 COOH terminus and targets the major c-myc promoter, P2. This repression is independent of the Mxi1 NH2 terminus and mSin3, and thus differs from the E-box repression function of Mxi1. Thus, Mxi1 represses genes required for proliferation through two distinct pathways: repression of E-box-dependent genes by a mechanism dependent on the Mxi1 amino terminus interaction with mSin3, and repression of the c-myc P2 promoter by a mechanism dependent on the Mxi1 carboxyl-terminal domain. To express Mxi1 in vivo, CMV-Mxi1 was constructed by subcloning a fragment from the full-length Mxi1 cDNA (a 2.4-kb EcoRI fragment (24Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) generated by PCR using a 5′ primer 5′-CGGGATCCACCATGGAGCGGGTGAAGAT (mx1f) and a 3′ primer (5′)-GGAATTCCCACTGTTATGTCATGCTGGG (mx2r) into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The following mutations were generated by PCR and expressed in pcDNA3. CMV-Mxi1NT36 was generated using a 5′ primer 5′-CGGGATCCATGCCGAGCCCCCGACTGCA and the same 3′ primer as in the wild-type Mxi1 construction. CMV-Mxi1CT149 and CMV-Mxi1CT187 were constructed using the same 5′ primer as the wild-type construction and a 3′ primer, (5′)-GGAATTCCTAACCCTGCAGCTGTTCCAG or (5′)-GGAATTCCTAGGAGAACTCTGTGCTTTC, respectively. CMV-Mxi1 ΔBR was constructed by subcloning from CMV-Mxi1 a PCR-generated fragment made in two steps: first, by amplifying the NH2-terminal fragment with the 5′ primer mx1f and 3′ primer (5′)-AAGGCGCAGATGAGCTCTGTTGGCAGTGCT, and the COOH-terminal fragment with 5′ primer 5′-AGCACTGCCAACAGAGCTCATCTGCGCCTT and 3′ primermx2r; then, by generating the full deletion mutant by mixing the two reactions and amplifying with mx1f andmx2r primers. Mutant Mxi1 expressing plasmids CMV-Mxi1ΔLZ, CMV-Mxi1Δ162–185, CMV-Mxi1Δ170/172[SS-AA], and CMV-Mxi1Δ198/200[SS-AA] were similarly constructed. The primers used for generating the NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments were: for ΔLZ, mxif and (5′)-TTCCATCTCCTGAGGGATGTGTGCTTTGGC, and 5′-GCCAAAGCACACATCCCTCAGGAGATGGAA and mx2r, respectively; for Δ162–185, mx1f and (5′)-TTCTCCATGGGAGAAAATGCTGTCCATTCG, and 5′-CGAATGGACAGCATTTTCTCCCATGGAGAA and mx2r, respectively; for Δ170/172[SS-AA], mx1f and (5′)-CTCTCGCTCTGCATCAGCACGATC, and 5′-GATCGTGCTGATGCAGAGCGAGAG andmx2r, respectively; and for Δ198/200[SS-AA],mxif and (5′)-ATCAATGTCAGCGATGGCGGTGGT, and 5′-ACCACCGCCATCGCTGACATTGAT and mx2r, respectively. Mxi1 wild-type and mutants (except for Δ170/172[SS-AA] and Δ198/200[SS-AA]) were tagged at their amino termini with the FLAG epitope in order to distinguish their in vivo expression from that of endogenous Mxi1. Flag-Mxi1 had the same phenotype as Mxi1 in repression assays (data not shown). M4tk-luc was derived from M4MinCAT (gift of L. Kretzner) by replacing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene with the luciferase gene. Tk-luc was constructed by deleting the four tandem E-box repeats from the upstream promoter region of m4tk-luc. P2(−2489)-luc was constructed by cloning −2489 to +352 (relative to P2) withHindIII linkers into the HindIII site of pGL2Basic (Promega). P2(−514) was derived from a PvuII digestion of the −2489/+352 fragment and cloning into thePvuII/HindIII site of pGL2Basic. P2(−70)-luc contains −70 to +10 relative to P2 and was constructed by PCR amplification using 5′ primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGCTTGGCGGGAAAAAGAACG and 3′ primer (5′)-CCCAAGCTTGTACAGCGAGTTAGATAAAGC, and cloned intoXhoI/HindIII digested pGL2Basic. P1P2myc-luc, P2myc-luc, and P1myc-luc contain c-myc promoter fragments −266 to +352, −96 to +352, and −266 to −96 (relative to P2), respectively, and were constructed by cloning the insert from the appropriate restriction enzyme digestion of P2(−2489)-luc into pGL2Basic. P2TATA-luc, P2SVL-luc, and SVL-luc were kindly provided by J. Lang. Plasmid MT-mxi1 was constructed by inserting the human Mxi1 coding sequence (aa 1–228) tagged with a NH2-terminal Flag-epitope (DYKDDDDK) obtained by PCR amplification of a fragment from the human Mxi1 cDNA (24Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) into MT-neo (also known as pMTH βglobin.neo, kindly provided by S. Segal) in the sense orientation. NIH3T3 and 3T3L1 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Differentiation of 3T3L1 cells was performed as described in published procedures (55Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections of NIH3T3 cells were performed in 10-cm dishes using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (56Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A total of 25 μg of plasmid DNA was used in each transfection, consisting of 3–8 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of CMV-βgal as an internal control plasmid to monitor transfection efficiency, a variable amount of expression plasmid adjusted with empty vector plasmid to equalize the amount of effector plasmid, and pBS SK plasmid as carrier DNA. For stable transfections into NIH3T3 and 3T3L1 cells, 5 μg of MT-mxi1 or MT-neo were used. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 800 or 1500 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively. Individual clones were expanded and used for experiments or cryopreserved. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-LightTM chemiluminescent reporter assay system (Tropix, Inc.) and performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with the modification that 100 μl of lysis buffer were used to lyse cell pellets prepared from 10-cm dishes. Ten microliters of the lysate were mixed with 100 μl of reaction buffer and 100 μl of light emission accelerator. The same lysate (50 μl) was used for measurement of luciferase activity in a Berthold Lumat LB9501 luminometer as described previously (49Li L.H. Nerlov C. Prendergast G. MacGregor D. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to account for variations in transfection efficiency. Normalization between experiments was done by setting the activity obtained with the empty expression vector equal to 1. -Fold change is calculated as the inverse of relative luciferase activity. A positive -fold change represents stimulation; a negative -fold change, repression. At least four determinations were made for each reporter/activator combination. Northern analyses were performed as described previously (52Lee T.C. Li L. Philipson L. Ziff E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12886-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using human cDNA probes for human c-myc, human mxi1, and humangapdh labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (Boehringer Mannheim). Western blotting was performed as described previously (52Lee T.C. Li L. Philipson L. Ziff E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12886-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Amounts of total cellular protein from transiently transfected cells were normalized to β-galactosidase activity to adjust for variations in transfection efficiency, and protein lysates representing equivalent β-galactosidase activity were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting. Otherwise, 50 or 100 μg of total protein per lane were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Detection was performed with the Amersham ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (International Biotechnologies, Inc) or goat anti-Mad2 (Mxi1) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect Mxi1. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect c-Myc. Cell cycle distribution experiments were performed as described previously (52Lee T.C. Li L. Philipson L. Ziff E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12886-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton & Dickinson). Briefly, 5 × 105cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplement with 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and fixed in 100% ethanol. The fixed cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.75 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (with 2% fetal calf serum), stained with propidium iodide, and treated with RNase A. These cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry for DNA content. The 3T3L1 cell line differentiates in culture from a proliferating preadipocyte cell to a non-proliferating postmitotic adipocyte (Fig. 1 A) (57Green H. Meuth M. Cell. 1974; 3: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Between days 1 and 7 of 3T3L1 differentiation, c-mycmRNA levels decrease and mxi1 messenger RNA expression is strongly induced (Fig. 1 B). These changes are reminiscent of the inverse relationship of mxi1 and c-mycgene expression in other differentiation systems (24Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 34Larsson L.G. Pettersson M. Oberg F. Nilsson K. Luscher B.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2487-2501PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest a role for Mxi1 in the repression of c-myc. We therefore asked whether Mxi1 can repress the c-myc promoter. For these and subsequent experiments that employ transient transfection, we made use of NIH3T3 cells, which are the parent cells of 3T3L1. This was necessary because transfection of 3T3L1 preadipocytes was extremely inefficient, while NIH3T3 cells were readily transfected. We transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells with increasing amounts of the Mxi1 expression plasmid, CMV-Mxi1,and the repression target plasmid, P2(−2489)-luc (Fig.2), which contains residues −2489 to +352 of the human c-myc promoter region (numbering relative to P2) linked to the firefly luciferase reporter gene. A cotransfected CMV-βgal expression plasmid provided an internal control for variations in transfection efficiency. In an initial experiment (Fig.2), transient expression of Mxi1 reduced c-myc promoter activity 3-fold, but the tk promoter, a control, was relatively unaffected. Repression of c-myc by Mxi1 differed from repression of an E-box. While the Max protein is required for Mxi1 repression of the E-box (23Ayer D.E. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N.

Indeed, Max expression in the absence of Mxi1 greatly stimulated the c-myc promoter (Fig. 3 A). As a control, Max synergized with Mxi1 to repress E-box-dependent transcription from plasmid m4tk-luc (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, the Mxi1 mutant, Mxi1NT36, which lacks the Mxi1 amino-terminal 35 amino acids required for mSin3 interaction (Fig.4 A) and for mSin3-dependent repression of E-boxes (26Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 40Koskinen P.J. Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 623-629PubMed Google Scholar), repressed c-myc promoter activity to the same extent as wild-type Mxi1 (Fig. 4 B), although as expected, it could not repress the E-box-dependent activity of m4tk-luc (Fig. 4 B). These observations indicate that Mxi1 represses the c-mycpromoter and E-boxes by different mechanisms.Figure 2Repression of the c-mycpromoter by Mxi1. Reporter plasmid P2(−2489)-luc (5 μg) or tk-luc (10 μg) was co-transfected with the indicated amounts of CMV-Mxi1.

We studied the regulation of both enzymes by interleukins 4 and 13 and found an inverse response. When human lung carcinoma cells A549 were cultured in vitro in the presence of these cytokines, an up-regulation of the 12/15-lipoxygenase and a down-regulation of the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase were observed. A similar inverse regulation was found in human peripheral monocytes. Interleukin 4-treated A549 cells exhibited an impaired capability of reducing exogenous hydroperoxyl lipids and their levels of endogenous lipid hydroperoxides were markedly increased. To find out whether these regulatory processes also occur in vivo, arachidonic acid oxygenase and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase activity was assayed in various tissues of transgenic mice that systemically overexpress interleukin 4. In lung, spleen, kidney, and heart, an increased arachidonic acid oxygenase activity was detected when transgenic mice were compared with inbred controls. The phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase activity was impaired in lung, liver, and spleen of the transgenic animals. These data indicate that lipid-peroxidizing and lipid peroxide-reducing enzymes are inversely regulated in various mammalian cells. Up-regulation of the 12/15-lipoxygenase and simultaneous down-regulation of the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase may lead to an increased oxidizing potential, which is reflected by an augmented intracellular peroxide tone."
https://openalex.org/W2010521881,"The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) is an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein that binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) as well as certain members of the low density lipoprotein receptor superfamily and antagonizes ligand binding. In order to identify important functional regions of RAP, studies were performed to define the domain organization and domain boundaries of this molecule. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments revealed that the process of thermal denaturation of RAP is highly reversible and occurs in a broad temperature range with two well resolved heat absorption peaks. A good fit of the endotherm was obtained with four two-state transitions suggesting these many cooperative domains in the molecule. A number of recombinant fragments of RAP were expressed in bacteria, and their domain composition and stability were characterized by DSC, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results confirmed that RAP is composed of four independently folded domains, D1, D2, D3, and D4, that encompass residues 1–92, 93–163, 164–216, and 217–323, respectively. The first and the fourth domains preserved their structure and stability when isolated, whereas the compact structure of the fragment corresponding to D2 seems to be altered when isolated from the parent molecule. Isolated D3 was partially degraded during isolation from bacterial lysates. The isolated D4 was capable of binding with high affinity to LRP whereas neither D1 nor D2 bound. At the same time a fragment containing both D1 and D2 exhibited high affinity binding to LRP. These facts combined with the thermodynamic analysis of the melting process of the fragments containing D1 and D2 indicate that these two domains interact with each other and that the proper folding of the second domain into a native-like active conformation requires presence of the first domain.

Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the results of these studies suggest that multiple portions of RAP are capable of interacting with LRP. However, a detailed understanding of structure-function relationships is hampered by the fact that the domain organization of RAP is not known. A possible internal triplication is noticed by aligning residues 1–100, 101–200, and 201–319 of rat RAP (20Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3404-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which led to the suggestion that RAP is composed of three domains. This initial observation was modified by Ellgaard et al. (22Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) who suggested the three putative domains may comprise residues 18–112, 113–218, and 219–323 of human RAP. Although the three-dimensional structure of RAP is not yet known, the solution structure of fragment 18–112 has been solved by NMR (23Nielsen P.R. Ellgaard L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Poulsen F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that this portion of RAP consists of three helices composed of residues 23–34, 39–65, and 73–88. Residues 92–112 were found to be disordered in the structure, raising the possibility that the domain boundaries deduced from the primary sequence may not be correct. A more comprehensive identification of functional regions on RAP requires the delineation of its domain organization. To accomplish this we performed studies to define the domain structure of RAP and the boundaries of its domains by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results of these studies reveal that human RAP is composed of four independently folded domains. The first NH2-terminal domain and the second domain appear to interact with each other, whereas the forth COOH-terminal domain seems to be rather independent within the molecule. The third domain is proteolyzed during isolation resulting in destabilization. Binding studies reveal that the first and second domain cooperate to form a high affinity binding site for LRP and that the isolated fourth domain of RAP also binds with high affinity to LRP. Human RAP cDNA that was cloned into the pGex-2T vector (10Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was utilized as a template to amplify by polymerase chain reaction a cDNA encoding the RAP fragments studied. The following oligonucleotides were used as primers: 5′-CCGCGTGGATCCTACTCGCGGGAA-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCTCAATTGAGGTTGCGTAT-3′ for fragment 1–82; 5′-CCGCGTGGATCCTACTCGCGGGAA-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCTCATCCGTCCAG ACCATA-3′ for fragment 1–92; 5′-CCGCGTGGATCCTACTCGCGGGAA-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCTCACACCTGCCGAGCGTC-3′ for fragment 1–99; 5′-CCGCGTGGATCCTACTCGCGGGAA-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCTCAAGCCTCAGTGCTGTA-3′ for fragment 1–216; 5′-CCGCGTGGATCCTACTCGCGGGAA-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCTCATTCGGTCCTGCTCAG-3′ for fragment 1–164; 5′-CCGCGTGGATCCTACTCGCGGGAA-3′ and 5′-CATGAATCCTCACAGGTCCGAGGGGCT-3′ for fragment 1–175; 5′-TTGGCCGGATCCGGTCTGGACGGAAAG-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCTCATTCGGTCCTGCTCAG-3′ for fragment 89–164; 5′-TTGGCCGGATCC GGTCTGGACGGAAAG-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCTCAAGCCTCAGTGCTGTA-3′ for fragment 89–216; 5′-ATACGCGGATCCAATGTCATCTTGGCC-3′ and 5′-GACGGCGAATTCTCAGAGTTCGTT GTGCCG-3′ for fragment 82–323; 5′-TGCTGGGATCCCTGAGCAGGACCGAA-3′ and 5′-CATGAATTCTCAAGCCTCAGTGCTGTA-3′ for fragment 159–216; 5′-CCGCATGGATCCAGGGTCAGCCAC-3′ and 5′-GACGGCGAATTCTCAGAGTTCGTTGTGCCG-3′ for fragment 206–323; 5′-TACAGCGGATCCGCTGAGTTCGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GACGGCGAATTCTCAGAGTTCGTTGTGCCG-3′ for fragment 216–323. The sense primer was designed with a BamHI cleavage site and the antisense primer with an EcoRI cleavage site to facilitate cloning into the pGex-2T vector. The cleaved pGex-2T vector and the cDNA of the RAP fragment were isolated after digestion withBamHI and EcoRI. The cDNA was then ligated into the cleaved pGex-2T vector and then transformed intoEscherichia coli DH5 F′. Clones were selected for growth on LB plates containing ampicillin. The resultant clones were then sequenced to determine integrity. This expression vector is designed to produce a fusion protein of the insert encoded protein and glutathioneS-transferase (GST) from Schistosoma japonicumand contains a thrombin cleavage site between the GST and encoded protein. The fusion proteins were purified and digested with thrombin as described (10Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the cleavage was performed at room temperature. In the case of fragment 216–323, digestion was carried out at room temperature for 8 h using a 1/500 ratio of thrombin to fragment. Even under these conditions only approximately 40% of the GST fusion protein was cleaved. Secondary structure predictions for RAP and its fragments was done with PCGene software using GGBSM method that employs the protocol of Gascuel and Golmard (24Gascuel O. Golmard J.L. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 357-365PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in all experiments were determined spectrophotometrically using absorption coefficients (A 2800.1%) calculated from the amino acid composition of RAP and its individual fragments by the following equation:A 2800.1% = (5,690W + 1, 280Y + 120 S-S)/(0.1m), where W, Y, and S-S represent the number of Trp and Tyr residues and disulfide bonds, respectively, and m represents molecular mass (25Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar, 26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5009) Google Scholar). Molecular masses of the recombinant fragments were calculated based on their amino acid composition. The following values of molecular masses and A 2800.1% were used: RAP, 0.926 and 37,915; fragment 206–323, 0.688 and 13,995; fragment 1–216, 1.11 and 25,298; fragment 1–164, 1.38 and 19,408; fragment 1–175, 1.30 and 20,613; fragment 1–99, 1.18 and 11,801; fragment 1–92, 1.29 and 10,975; fragment 89–164, 1.44 and 8,937; fragment 89–216, 0.952 and 14,827; fragment 82–323, 0.84 and 28,246. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter with a Peltier PFD-350S unit for temperature control. Proteins were dissolved in phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 8.65), and their concentrations were optimized as recommended by Johnson (27Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Protein thermal stability was monitored by CD spectroscopy at constant wavelength. For assessing tertiary structure, unfolding was monitored in the near UV at 268 nm (ellipticity minimum) and 291 (ellipticity maximum). For secondary structure unfolding, changes in ellipticity were followed at 222 nm, the characteristic benchmark for α-helix. For temperature scan experiments, the protein ellipticity was monitored at constant wavelength in the near and far UV. Spectra were recorded in the temperature range of 5–95 °C at 0.5 °C/min in steps of 0.1 °C with an instrument response of 4 s. The protein solution was contained in a 1-cm optical path length cell, under magnetic stirring. For secondary structure analysis, a 1-mm path length cell was used, and CD spectra data points were recorded every 0.5 nm for the wavelength range 300–180 nm at 5 and 95 °C with 20 nm/min scans and a 2-s response time. Four scans were accumulated per spectrum. Secondary structure was estimated via the variable selection method using the VARSLC1 program (28Toumadje A. Alcorn S.W. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements of thermal unfolding were performed by monitoring the ratio of the intrinsic fluorescence intensity at 350 nm to that at 320 nm with excitation at 280 nm in an SLM 8000-C fluorometer. Right angle light scattering was measured simultaneously in the same fluorometer with excitation and emission set at 350 nm. Temperature was controlled with a circulating water bath programmed to raise the temperature at 1 °C/min. Protein concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 0.05 mg/ml. Titration with urea or guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) was accomplished in the same instrument at room temperature by continuous addition with a motorized syringe of a concentrated stock solution of the titrant (8m GdmCl or 10 m urea) at 20 μl/min to a stirred cuvette containing 1.6 ml of the protein while monitoring the fluorescence ratio and right angle light scattering as above. Both the fluorometer and the syringe driver were controlled by a computer that automatically corrected the fluorescence intensity for dilution assuming a linear dependence on protein concentration below 0.15 mg/ml. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were made with a DASM-4M calorimeter (29Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) at a scan rate of 1 °C/min. Protein concentrations varied from 1.0 to 2.0 mg/ml. The DSC curves were corrected for the instrumental base line obtained by heating the solvent. Deconvolution analysis was performed as described (29Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 30Filimonov V.V. Potekhin S.A. Matveev S.V. Privalov P.L. Mol. Biol. (Moscow). 1982; 16: 551-562PubMed Google Scholar). The software allows an analysis by either independent or dependent schemes. The former is based on the assumption that each domain unfolds independently, regardless of the state of the neighboring domains. The latter assumes an ordered process in which constituent domains unfold sequentially, implying the occurrence of interactions between domains such that the unfolding of any given domain depends on the status of its neighbors. In the absence of domain-domain interactions the two schemes give essentially the same results, whereas the dependent scheme gives a better fit if there is such interaction. Melting temperatures (T m), calorimetric (ΔH cal), and van't Hoff (ΔH vH) enthalpies were determined from the DSC curves using the same software. The values of the theoretical heat capacity of the denatured RAP and its fragments were calculated based on the amino acid composition of the protein as described (31Privalov P.L. Makhatadze G.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 32Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The values of the partial molar heat capacities of amino acid side chains in aqueous solutions that were used for the calculation were taken from Privalov and Makhatadze (31Privalov P.L. Makhatadze G.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). RAP and all RAP fragments were iodinated with 125I by IODO-GEN (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (33Williams S.E. Inoue I. Tran H. Fry G.L. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.-H. Lalouel J.-M. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8653-8658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with specific activities ranging from 3 to 17 μCi/μg. Wells of microtiter plates (Dynatech Immulon 2, Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of 1 μg/ml LRP. The wells were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2 for 1 h at 25 °C. Following washing, the indicated concentrations of RAP, fragment 1–92, fragment 89–164, fragment 1–164, fragment 89–216, or fragment 206–323 were added to the wells and also to control wells coated with just bovine serum albumin. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the wells were washed, and 100 μl of 0.1 n NaOH was added. An aliquot was removed and counted. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using (Equation 1), B=Bmax[L]KD+[L]Equation 1 where B represents the amount of ligand bound,B max is the amount of ligand bound at saturation, [L] is the molar concentration of free ligand, andK D is the dissociation constant. Fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering were used to derive initial information about the conditions for denaturation of RAP in order to identify those under which the protein unfolds reversibly and/or without aggregation. Fig.1 A presents several curves obtained by heating RAP at pH values between 2.9 and 10.5 while monitoring the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 350 nm to that at 320 nm as a measure of the spectral shift that accompanies unfolding. Under such conditions the protein exhibited a sigmoidal denaturation transition whose midpoint (T m) was sensitive to pH. The denaturation process was partially or fully reversible in all cases since the fluorescence parameter returned to a value near the original upon cooling of the heated sample with the highest degree of reversibility occurring between pH 4.3 and 8.7. The protein also exhibited the highest stability in this pH range. At the same time the denaturation was accompanied by partial aggregation of the denatured molecules since simultaneous light scattering measurements indicated an increase in turbidity following denaturation that was not restored upon cooling (an example is shown in Fig. 1 B). The turbidity was abolished when RAP was heated at pH 8.7 in the presence of 0.5m urea (Fig. 1 B) with 0.25 m GdmCl producing a similar effect (not shown). Both urea and GdmCl did not change noticeably the stability of the protein at pH 8.7. These conditions were selected for studying the denaturation of RAP with DSC, a technique that gives more information about the structural organization of the molecule. The original endotherm of RAP obtained by heating the protein in the calorimeter while monitoring the changes in its heat capacity (C p) is presented in Fig.2 A (solid curve). The endotherm exhibits two well resolved heat absorption peaks that are centered at 43 and 63 °C and reflect denaturation of at least two compact regions with different stability. The denaturation of RAP was highly reversible since the endotherm was well reproduced when the protein was heated up to 95 °C then cooled and reheated (Fig.2 A, inset). This is in excellent agreement with the fluorescence data even though the concentration of the protein used in the DSC experiment was more than 1 order of magnitude higher. TheC p function of the denatured RAP almost coincides with the theoretically calculated C p function after 85 °C indicating that the protein was fully denatured at this temperature and that the exothermic processes of aggregation are absent upon denaturation. The high reversibility of the process and the absence of post-denaturation aggregation enabled for accurate determination of the C p function in the studied temperature region. This allowed us to perform a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the excess heat capacity function (ΔC p(exc)), i.e. the observed heat absorption on melting of the protein, that provides more definite information on the number of the independently folded domains in RAP. In this analysis one can deconvolute the ΔC p(exc) function into simple constituents corresponding to the heat effect of individual two-state transitions that reflect melting of individual domains (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although the accuracy of the deconvolution analysis depends mainly on the accuracy of the experimentally determined C pfunction, in the case of RAP the main challenge is the proper selection of the base line for accurate determination of ΔC p(exc). Despite the well defined beginning and ending of the process, the occurrence of the denaturation in a broad temperature range (25–85 °C) results in difficulties in the accurate determination of this parameter (ΔC p(exc)). When the base line was drawn arbitrarily as presented in Fig. 2 A (dashed lines, a and b), the total enthalpies of the process were found to be slightly different, 152 and 170 kcal/mol. Of significance, the deconvolution analysis resulted in three two-state transitions in the first case and four transitions in the second case (Fig. 2 B) reflecting the melting of that many domains, respectively, in the protein. To select between these two schemes an additional study with individual RAP fragments was performed. The deconvolution of the RAP endotherm into three two-state transitions (see above) is in agreement with the three-domainal composition of RAP proposed on the basis of triplicate internal sequence similarity with residues 18–112, 113–218, and 219–323 forming three individual domains (22Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To test this model we expressed two fragments as follows: 1–216 that was expected to comprise two domains, and 216–323 corresponding to the third predicted domain. Note that we selected slightly different boundaries between predicted domains 2 and 3 (at 216–217) to correlate with the boundaries between exons encoding corresponding regions (Fig.3 A). The fragments were expressed in a bacterial system as fusion proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). Digestion of GST-RAP1–216 generated fragment 1–216 in high yield. In contrast, the GST-RAP216–323 fusion protein was not readily cleaved by thrombin (see “Experimental Procedures”), most likely due to the presence of acidic residues near the cleavage site. To avoid this complication we expressed a longer version of this fragment starting at residue 206, and we obtained high yields of the final 206–323 fragment. This fragment exhibited a CD spectrum typical for α-helical proteins (Fig. 4 A, inset). Comparison of its melting properties with that of the 216–323 fragments by fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that both fragments exhibit similar sigmoidal transitions in the same temperature range (Fig. 4 B) indicating that they both form cooperative structure with similar stability. The CD-detected melting curve of the 206–323 fragment (Fig. 4 A) also revealed a cooperative unfolding transition with a similar T m as that measured by fluorescence. When melted in the calorimeter the 206–323 RAP fragment exhibited a symmetrical heat absorption peak in the same temperature range that was readily fitted with a two-state transition with a denaturation enthalpy (ΔH) of 45 kcal/mol and aT m of 43.1 °C (Fig.5 and TableI). These results indicate that the 216–323 region of RAP forms a stable cooperative domain and suggest that the extra 10 residues in 206–323 fragment most probably are not a part of this domain.Figure 4Fluorescence- and CD-detected thermal denaturation of COOH- and NH2-terminal recombinant fragments of RAP.

Rat VAChT has a number of aspartate residues within its predicted transmembrane domains (TM) and cytoplasmic loops, which may play important structural or functional roles in acetylcholine transport. In order to identify functional charged residues, site-directed mutagenesis of rVAChT was undertaken.

However, replacement of Asp-398 in TM10 with Asn completely eliminated both ACh transport and vesamicol binding. The conservative mutant D398E retained transport activity, but not vesamicol binding, suggesting this residue is critical for transport. Mutation of Asp-193 in TM4 did not affect ACh transport activity; however, vesamicol binding was dramatically reduced.

Based on hydrophobic moment analysis of the deduced primary amino acid sequence, it appears that VAChT has 12 transmembrane domains and 2 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Both glycosylation sites are found within the luminal loop between the first and second putative transmembrane domain (16Erickson J.D Varoqui H. Schafer M.K.H. Modi W. Diebler M.F. Weihe E. Rand J.B.

The sequence of VAChT cDNAs and their predicted structure indicate that VAChT and the two vesicular monoamine transporters VMAT1 and VMAT2, which are responsible for biogenic amine accumulation (19Erickson J.D.

Sequence conservation of charged and polar amino acids within the putative hydrophobic transmembrane domains of VAChT from different species suggests functional importance. This could reflect their involvement in maintaining the native conformation of the transporter, an involvement in substrate binding, or a role in H+/antiporter activity. Thus, aspartate residues within putative transmembrane domains (TMs) 1, 6, 10, and 11 are conserved between all species of VAChT and both forms of VMAT (14Alfonso A. Grundahl K. Duerr J.S. Han H.-P.

At least three of these conserved aspartates, those in TMs 1, 10 and 11, have been shown to be critical for amine transport in VMAT1 and VMAT2 (21Steiner-Mordach S. Shirvan A. Schuldiner S. J. Biol.

Fon E. Bellocchio E. Edwards R.H. Poo M.M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). An aspartate residue in TM4, which is found in all species of VAChT, but is absent in VMATs, has been reported as a critical residue for ACh transport (24Song H.J. Ming G.L. Fon E. Bellocchio E. Edwards R.H. Poo M.M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A proposed charge-pair interaction between a lysine in TM2 and aspartate in TM11, both conserved in all amine transporters and VAChT, has been demonstrated to be crucial for substrate recognition in VMAT2 (23Merickel A. Kaback H.R. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5403-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, although transmembrane aspartate residues have been shown to be important for VMATs, these residues have not been systematically studied in VAChT. In this study, we have used a mutant PC12 cell line, which is devoid of endogenous VAChT, but contains the small synaptic vesicles to which VAChT is normally targeted, to study the function of conserved aspartate residues in the cytoplasmic loops and in the hydrophobic transmembrane domains of rat VAChT. The results of this study led to the identification of aspartate residues that are crucial for ACh transport and/or vesamicol binding. For these studies, we utilized a mutant PC12 cell line, PC12A123.7, which was generated by transfection of PC12 cells with a mutant regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (25Correll L.A. Woodford T.A. Corbin T.D. Mellon P.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16672-16678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PC12A123.7 is deficient in both type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (26Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been found to express negligible levels of both ChAT (27Inoue H. Li Y.-P. Wainer J.A. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Shimojo M. Wu D. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1118-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and VAChT (28Shimojo M. Wu D. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1118-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Wild-type rat VAChT was subcloned into theEcoRI and XbaI site of pBluescript SK+ (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel et al. (29Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) using the BD2399 strain of Escherichia coli to prepare a single-stranded uracil-containing DNA. Mutagenic oligonucleotides, which contain a single base mismatch with wild-type VAChT, were annealed to the parental single-stranded DNA and extended to synthesize the complementary strand. The product was transformed into the JM109 strain of E. coli to remove uracil-containing parental DNA. To verify that only the desired mutation was introduced, the mutated portion was sequenced by the dideoxy method (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar). The intact VAChT was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). PC12A123.7 cells were maintained in 10% CO2 at 37 °C in a 1:1 mixture of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 Ham's nutrient mixture containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Wild-type and mutant rVAChT cDNAs were transfected into PC12A123.7 cells by electroporation. For electroporation, cells were detached from plates with trypsin/EDTA, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 800 μl of cold PBS at a concentration of ∼6 × 107 cells/ml. The resuspended cells were mixed with 50 μg of DNA. After a 10-min incubation on ice, the cell-DNA mixture was transferred to a 0.4-cm gap cuvette (Bio-Rad), electroporated (0.2 kV, 975 microfarads), then replated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 Ham's medium and cultured for 48–72 h. At 24 h after electroporation, the medium was changed. The level of expression of wild-type and mutant VAChTs was checked by Western blot analysis. Within a given experiment, VAChT expression levels did not vary significantly between replicates or between different constructs. Transfected cells were trypsinized and rinsed with ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). Cell pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 4% of protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim), and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). The cell suspension was homogenized on ice with a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer by several up and down strokes within a 5-min period. Postnuclear supernatants were then collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration was measured with the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent based on the Bradford method (Pierce). Vesicle suspensions were incubated with 100 μm acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (paraoxon), for 30 min at room temperature as a precautionary measure. However, we could not detect any acetylcholinesterase activity in the untreated postnuclear supernatant using acetylthiocholine as a substrate. The treated vesicles were stored at −80 °C until use. Transport of acetylcholine into synaptic vesicles and vesamicol binding to the vesicles were performed according to Varoqui and Erickson (31Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27229-27232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, for ACh transport assays, aliquots (50 μl) of postnuclear supernatants containing 500 μg of protein were mixed with uptake/binding buffer (50 μl) containing 110 mm potassium tartrate, 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mm ascorbic acid and preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence or absence of the following drugs:l-vesamicol (Research Biochemicals Inc.), bafilomycin A1 (Sigma), or carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP; Sigma). Uptake was initiated by addition of uptake/binding buffer (100 μl) containing 10 mm Mg2+-ATP and various concentrations of [3H]ACh (40–50 mCi/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and allowed to proceed at 37 °C for the desired time period. For vesamicol binding assays, aliquots (50 μl) of postnuclear supernatants containing 250 μg of protein were mixed with uptake/binding buffer (150 μl) containing various concentrations of [3H]vesamicol (31 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). The suspensions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Both uptake and binding reactions were terminated by vacuum filtration through an HAWP filter (Millipore) pre-wetted with cold uptake/binding buffer followed by two washes with 5 ml each of ice-cold uptake/binding buffer. Radioactivity bound to the filters was solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1% SDS and measured by scintillation counting in 4 ml of Econo-Safe (Research Product International Co.). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 4 μm unlabeled vesamicol in the absence of ATP at 0 °C, and was subtracted from total binding. Each experiment was performed in duplicate, and the experiment was repeated twice. 500 μl (5 mg of total protein) of postnuclear supernatant was loaded onto a 10-ml linear sucrose gradient from 0.6 to 1.6 m sucrose in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 6 h in an SW40 rotor in a Beckman LE-80 centrifuge at 4 °C. Fractions of 500 μl were collected from the bottom of the tube and stored at −80 °C until use. For the detection of mutant protein expression, 5 μl of postnuclear supernatant (50 μg of total protein) from each mutant was diluted to 500 μl with homogenization buffer and then pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 1 h in a TLA-100–3 rotor using a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) using a semidry electrotransfer apparatus (Alltech). The blot was blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 10% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was sequentially incubated with primary antibody (goat anti-rVAChT antibody; Chemicon International Co.), then with secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase for 1 h each at room temperature. Between each reaction, the blot was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min. The immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The same fractions from sucrose gradients were immunoblotted as described above using either a monoclonal antibody against synaptophysin (Boehringer Mannheim) or a rabbit antiserum against secretogranin II. The latter antiserum was a generous gift from Dr. Jonathan Scammell, University of Alabama. Based on studies with other transporters, evidence has been obtained that negatively charged residues on the cytoplasmic membrane surface may play a role in substrate-protein interaction at the beginning or end of the transport cycle. We thus used asparagine scanning mutagenesis to investigate the importance of conserved aspartate residues found on cytoplasmic loops of rVAChT. There are two aspartate residues, Asp-147 and Asp-152, in the cytoplasmic loop between TM2 and TM3 of rVAChT. Asp-147 is conserved in all species of VAChT, but is absent in both VMAT1 and VMAT2. On the other hand, Asp-152 is not conserved in all species of VAChT, it is absent in C. elegans VAChT, and it is absent in VMATs (Fig. 1). As shown in Table I, when these two aspartate residues were substituted by asparagine, there was no significant difference in the ability of isolated vesicles to transport ACh.Table I[3H]ACh uptake by mutants in cytoplasmic loops of rVAChTMutants[3H]ACh uptakeActivitypmol/mg protein·min%Mock00WT26100D147N24.394D152N25.397D202N25.798D288N26.3101D410N26.7102Postnuclear supernatants from each mutant transfected cells were incubated with 0.5 mm [3H]ACh and 5 mm Mg2+-ATP in the uptake/binding buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Uptake and binding in the presence of 4 μm cold vesamicol was subtracted as a background. WT, wild-type. Open table in a new tab Postnuclear supernatants from each mutant transfected cells were incubated with 0.5 mm [3H]ACh and 5 mm Mg2+-ATP in the uptake/binding buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Uptake and binding in the presence of 4 μm cold vesamicol was subtracted as a background. WT, wild-type. There are three other aspartate residues found in cytoplasmic loops. These include Asp-202, which is located in the cytoplasmic loop between TM4 and TM5 and conserved in all VAChTs sequenced to date but absent in VMATs; and Asp-288, between TM6 and TM7, and Asp-410, between TM10 and TM11, which are conserved in all VAChT species and in VMATs (Fig. 1). Replacement of these residues with Asn also had no effect on acetylcholine transport (Table I). It should be noted that Asp-202 could reside within a transmembrane domain. It is located at the boundary between a hydrophobic transmembrane segment and a hydrophilic cytoplasmic loop segment. Thus, none of the five aspartate residues in cytoplasmic loops between transmembrane domains that, with the exception of Asp-152, which inC. elegans VAChT is a Glu residue, are conserved among VAChT species play a significant role in either ACh binding or ACh transport. VAChT has 12 transmembrane domains spanning the vesicular membrane. Because of the hydrophobic environment in these transmembrane regions, few charged amino acid residues are present. Those that are found in the transmembrane domain may play an important role in the transport process. We thus applied asparagine scanning mutagenesis to test the functionality of transmembrane aspartate residues. Asp-46 in TM1 and Asp-255 in TM6, are conserved in all VAChTs and in VMATs (Fig. 1 B). These residues appear to be located in the middle of the putative transmembrane domains in VAChT (Fig. 1 A). The aspartic acid residue in TM1 of VMAT2 plays a critical role in substrate recognition (22Merickel A. Rosandich P. Peter D. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), while mutation of the Asp residue in TM6 of VMAT2, although not eliminating serotonin transport, produced a consistent lower rate of transport (23Merickel A. Kaback H.R. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5403-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of these residues in the transport of acetylcholine, the mutants D46N and D255N were generated. As shown in Fig. 2, removal of the negative charge from these residues has no effect on the transport of acetylcholine or on vesamicol binding. As shown in Fig.3, each mutant expressed to the same extent as the wild-type VAChT. Furthermore, these mutants produce the same maximal accumulation of ACh as did wild-type VAChT (Fig.4). Thus, these charged residues do not have a critical role in substrate transport or vesicle targeting.Figure 3Western blot analysis of wild-type (WT) and mutant rVAChT proteins. Vesicle proteins from wild-type and mutant transfected PC12A123.7 cells were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and then immunoblotted with a goat anti-rat VAChT antibody.

However, in our hands, cells expressing the D193N mutant of rVAChT transported acetylcholine at the same rate as wild-type transporter (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.5 A, the time dependence for transport activity of D193N is the same as wild-type VAChT. The concentration dependence on acetylcholine (K m = 1.8 ± 0.4 mm, V max = 108 ± 16 pmol/mg) as well as the maximal accumulation of ACh by this mutant was identical to wild-type transporter (K m = 1.5 ± 0.3 mm, V max = 100 ± 9 pmol/mg) (Fig. 4 A). In order to confirm that the transport activity of this mutant is dependent on the H+-ATPase, we determined the dependence of the transport assay on Mg-ATP, as well as the effect of the proton ionophore FCCP, or in the specific V type ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (31Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27229-27232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Since the V-type ATPase is sensitive to low temperature (33Haigh J.R. Noremberg K. Parsons S.M. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also examined transport activity at 0 °C. As shown in Fig. 5 B, transport activity is completely inhibited in the absence of ATP, by the presence of 2.5 μm FCCP, or by the presence of 1 μm bafilomycin A1. Similarly, no transport was observed at 0 °C. The D193N mutant exhibited reduced vesamicol binding, while the D398N mutation virtually eliminated vesamicol binding, (Fig. 2 B). To confirm this result, the concentration dependence on vesamicol for inhibition of acetylcholine transport was measured. As shown in Fig.6, with the D193N mutant, vesamicol was much less effective in inhibiting acetylcholine transport,K i = ∼1 μm, compared with aK i of 100 nm for vesamicol inhibition of acetylcholine transport by wild-type transporter. Although not shown, vesamicol had no effect on acetylcholine transport at a concentration of 1 μm with the D398N mutant. In order to evaluate whether the vesamicol binding site might be involved in transporter targeting to synaptic vesicles, the postnuclear supernatants from wild-type transporter and the D193N, D398N, and D425N (see below) mutants were fractionated on a linear sucrose gradient by centrifugation. The result, which is shown in Fig.7, indicates that both the wild-type transporter and all three mutant transporters co-sediment with synaptophysin, a marker protein for small synaptic vesicles.

Stem cell factor (SCF), an essential regulator of spermatogenesis produced by Sertoli cells, utilize both modes of cell to cell communication. Indeed, SCF exists in soluble (SCFs) and membrane-bound (SCFm) forms, which are required for a complete spermatogenesis, and are generated by alternative splicing of optional exon 6, encoding sites of proteolysis. We show that in the mouse testis, the alternative splicing of SCF is developmentally regulated. SCFs predominates in fetal and neonatal gonads and is then replaced by SCFm in the prepubertal and adult gonads. By sequencing SCF exon 6, we show that the flanking intronic sequences perfectly follow the gt-at rule, suggesting that the basal splicing machinery might not be responsible by itself for exon 6 skipping. Moreover, freshly isolated Sertoli cells mainly express SCFm, but a switch to SCFs occurs after 48 h of culture. We found that this change can be prevented by acidification of the culture medium at pH 6.3 or by addition of lactate. The sustained synthesis of SCFm at low pH was no longer observed in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that SCF exon 6 skipping requires de novo protein synthesis. Accordingly, UV cross-linking experiments show that nuclear Sertoli cell protein(s) bind in a sequence-specific manner to exon 6. Together, our data allow the proposal of an integrated mechanism in which the synthesis of lactate by Sertoli cells is used in the same time as an energetic substrate for germ cells and as a promoter of their survival/proliferation through the production of SCFm.

Specifically, in the testis, the conversion of stem cell spermatogonia into differentiated haploid spermatozoa is a complex process highly dependent upon the somatic Sertoli cells. One of the major questions is the identification of the Sertoli cell-derived factors driving quiescent stem cells into proliferation. Although these factors are largely unknown, some growth factors and cytokines have been suggested to be at play (2Benahmed M.

Mouse News Lett. 1960; 23: 33-34Google Scholar). SCF has been detected both in membrane-bound (SCFm) or soluble (SCFs) forms (7Anderson D.M. Lyman S.D. Baird A. Wignall J.M. Eisenman J. Rauch C.

The soluble form is generated from an integral membrane protein precursor, by proteolytic cleavage at a site located in the proximal extracellular domain (9Huang E.J. Nocka K.H. Buck J. Besmer P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Because the main proteolytic site involved in this process is encoded by a short 84-base pair-long alternative exon (exon 6), the final localization of SCF is ultimately dictated by differential splicing (10Flanagan J.G. Chan D. Leder P. Cell. 1991; 64: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Although SCFm and SCFs transcripts are equally abundant in spleen and heart (9Huang E.J.

Interestingly, in the testis, where SCF and its cognate receptor c-kit are produced, respectively, by Sertoli cells (12Motro B. Van der Kooy D. Rossant J. Reith A. Bernstein A.

Dev. 1996; 45: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the major form of SCF found in the adult mouse is SCFm (10Flanagan J.G. Chan D. Leder P. Cell. 1991; 64: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 11Marziali G. Lazzaro D. Sorrentino V. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Accordingly, SCFm has been shown to be of major functional importance for germ cells, as demonstrated by the infertility of mice homozygous for a SCF gene mutation named Steel-Dickie (Sld) (6Bernstein S.E. Mouse News Lett. 1960; 23: 33-34Google Scholar, 18Kuroda H. Nakayama H. Namiki M. Matsumoto K. Nishimune Y. Kitamura Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This mutation consists in an intragenic deletion of the transmembrane- and cytoplasmic domain-coding regions, resulting in the constitutive production of SCFs (10Flanagan J.G. Chan D. Leder P. Cell. 1991; 64: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 19Brannan C.I. Lyman S.D. Williams D.E. Eisenman J. Anderson D.M. Cosman D. Bedell M.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G.

In the present study, we demonstrate that SCF pre-mRNA splicing is developmentally regulated in the male gonad and that an acidic microenvironment, probably because of the high amounts of lactate in testicular Sertoli cells, might be responsible for the switch of SCF splicing in favor of SCFm, which can promote germ cell survival in the contact of Sertoli cells and proliferation of spermatogonia type A. OF1 mice were obtained from Iffa Credo (L'arbresle, France). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DME)/Ham's F-12 medium, TRIzol®, and reverse transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Eragny, France). Collagenase/dispase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Sigma was the source for transferrin, gentamicin, nystatin, insulin, α-tocopherol, HEPES, random hexanucleotides, and deoxynucleotides triphosphate (dNTP). Taq polymerase was purchased from Appligene-Oncor (Illkirch, France). Amersham Pharmacia Biotech was the source for [α-32P]UTP. In vitrotranscription kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), and ABI Prism® dye terminator kit was from Perkin-Elmer. Sertoli cells were prepared from 16- to 18-day-old mice, as described by Dorringtonet al. (20Dorrington J.H. Roller N.F. Fritz I.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1975; 3: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Sertoli cells were plated in 3-cm diameter plates in DME/F-12 medium supplemented with transferrin (5 μg/ml), insulin (2 μg/ml), gentamicin (20 μg/ml), nystatin (20 IU/ml), and α-tocopherol (10 μg/ml) and cultured at 32 °C. SCF intron 5 and 6 were amplified using a mouse DNA library as a template and Expand® long template PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). Intron 5 was amplified using the following primers (see Fig.1 A): S5 (5′-TGGTGGCATCTGACACTAGTGA-3′) and S6b (5′-GCTACTGCTGTCATTCCTAAGG-3′); intron 6 was amplified using the primers: S6a (5′-CCAGAGTCAGTGTCACAAAACC-3′) and S7 (5′-CTTCCAGTATAAGGCTCCAAAAGC-3′). PCRs were done in the presence of 300 nm primers in the following conditions: 94 °C for 5 min; 10 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 8 min; 20 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 8 min (with an increment of 20 s at each cycle); and 68 °C for 14 min; 90 ng of purified PCR products were used as template for DNA sequencing using the ABI Prism dye terminator kit in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer) for 30 cycles: 96 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 4 min. After cycling, PCR products were purified and dried, and just before loading, the sample was resuspended in 4.0 μl of deionized formamide, 50 mmEDTA, pH 8.0 (5:1). Fluorescence-based DNA sequence analyses were obtained on an ABI 373 DNA sequencer fitted with a 6% polyacrylamide gel using the manufacturer's version 2.1.0 software. Total RNAs were extracted from mouse testis or cultured Sertoli cells with TRIzol® reagent, a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate. Single strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription starting from 3 μg of total RNA and using 5 μm random hexanucleotides, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 1 units/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus. PCR reactions were done using Taqpolymerase (0.01 units/μl), 0.2 mm dNTP, and 0.01 μg/μl S5 and S7 primers. The mixture was first heated at 94 °C for 5 min and then 20 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 57 °C for 1 min (with 0.02 s and 0.3 °C decrease each cycle), 72 °C for 40 s followed with 12 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 51 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 40 s, then 72 °C for 5 min. SCF amplification products containing exon 6 (SCFs) or lacking exon 6 (SCFm) were, respectively, 251 bp and 167 bp long (Fig. 1 A). They were analyzed on 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium-UV staining. For β-actin RT-PCR we used the primers: 5′-GACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGAT-3′ and 5′-TTGCTGATCCACATCTGCTG-3′, and β-actin cDNAs were amplified according the following conditions 94 °C for 2 min, 28 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 5 min. Buffers A, C, and D used for preparation of nuclear extracts were described by Dignamet al. (21Dignam J.E. Lebovitz R.M. Rœder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). All steps were done on ice, and proteolysis was minimized by addition of 0.5 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride and 0.3 μg/ml antipain and leupeptin to all buffers. Aprotinin (0.5 μg/ml) was also added to buffers A and C. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dehbi et al. (22Dehbi M. Mbiguino A. Beauchemin M. Chatelain G. Bedard P.-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The extract was removed and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford at 545 nm, using bovine serum albumin as a standard (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). A SCF cRNA containing the last 57 nucleotides of exon 5, whole exon 6, and the first 46 nucleotides of exon 7 (named SCF 567) was synthesized by in vitrotranscription from a pGEM-T plasmid containing the corresponding cDNA fragment after linearization with NcoI and using the SP6 RNA polymerase. A SCF cRNA containing the last 57 nucleotides of exon 5 and 110 nucleotides of exon 7 but lacking exon 6 (named SCF 57) was transcribed using the T7 RNA polymerase after linearization of the pGEM-T vector with NotI. A 241-nucleotide-long cRNA Trk B, corresponding to a mRNA species produced by Sertoli cells but unrelated to SCF, was used as a control and generated by transcription from a pGEM-T vector containing the trkB cDNA using the SP6 RNA polymerase after linearization with NcoI. Radiolabeled RNAs were obtained by adding 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP in thein vitro transcription mixtures. The specific activity of32P-SCF 567 is 7.9 × 108 cpm/μg. Proteins interacting with radiolabeled precursor RNAs were detected by UV cross-linking methods (24Stolow D.T. Berget S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled RNAs were incubated with 20 μg of nuclear protein extracts for 10 min at 30 °C in binding buffer (1 mg/ml poly(G), 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2). After binding, samples were cross-linked at 2 J/cm2 using an Appligene UV cross-linker. Then, RNA was digested for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of RNase A (1 mg/ml). After the addition of SDS sample buffer, the samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min and then run on SDS, 10% PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed 1–2 days with Fuji RX film. SCFs and SCFm mRNAs were discriminated by exon connection RT-PCR, using primers defined in exons 5 and 7 and named S5 and S7, respectively, as shown in Fig.1 A. The SCFs cDNA fragment appears longer, with an additional 84-bp-long exon 6. Using this method, we have first determined the evolution of the SCFm/SCFs ratio during mouse testicular development (Fig. 1 B). Mouse testes were removed at different key stages of testicular developmenti.e. fetal (13, 15, 18 days post-coitum (dpc); day 0 post-coitum was the day where the vaginal plug was detected), neo-natal (2 and 8 days post-partum (dpp), pre-pubertal (10, 15, and 21 dpp), pubertal (28, and 42 dpp), and adult (60 dpp). SCFm (lacking exon 6) appears predominant in 13 dpc fetal testis, whereas SCFm and SCFs (containing exon 6) mRNAs appear equally abundant in 15 dpc testis, and SCFs becomes predominant at the end of gestation (18 dpc) and in neonatal testis (2 dpp) (Fig. 1 B). At the pre-pubertal and adult periods, male gonad contains predominantly SCFm. At 42 and 60 dpp, the total level of expression of SCF was lower because of the dilution of Sertoli cells (which are in a limited number) by the increasing amounts of adult germ cells (Fig. 1 B). Because most cases of alternative splicing are the consequence of suboptimal splice sites, we determined the genomic sequences surrounding exon 6. Surprisingly, this analysis showed that 5′ and 3′ splice sites of introns 5 and 6 perfectly follow the gt-ag rule, but in addition, exactly fit mammalian 5′ and 3′ splice site consensus motifs, which are, respectively, GTRAGT and YAG preceded by a polypyrimidine stretch (Fig. 2). The presence of these optimal splice sites suggests that the basal splicing machinery can not be responsible by itself for exon 6 skipping. Hence, we have looked for the presence of other cis elements that may be the targets for more specific RNA binding factors. The particularly high conservation degree of the exon 6 nucleotide sequence, when compared with upstream and downstream exons (TableI), suggest that, in addition to its coding capacity, the nucleotide sequence of exon 6 may contain a cis element involved in its own splicing. Scanning of the intronic sequences against data bases revealed that only the intronic region flanking exon 6 in 3′ (accession number AF083887) is related to a previously identified cDNA sequence. This cDNA (accession number A50814) corresponds to a human SCF mRNA species likely to have retained intron 6 during splicing.Table INucleotide sequence conservation of SCF gene exons among mammals% Identity/mouseExon 1Exon 2Exon 3Exon 4Exon 5Exon 6Exon 7Exon 8%%%%%%%%Human93959786861008594Pig98839685801007090The % of identity between mouse and human SCF (“Human”) and between mouse and pig SCF (“Pig”) are compared for each exon.

Note that only the exon 6 sequence is 100% conserved. We wanted then to test the ability of Sertoli cells to synthesize SCF when isolated from the whole testis context. As shown in Fig. 3, freshly isolated Sertoli cells (from 16–18-day-old animals) predominantly expressed SCFm mRNA, as observed in vivo. By contrast, during the culture, Sertoli cell SCF alternative splicing pattern changed in favor of the expression of SCFs mRNA (Fig. 3). For example, at 0.5 and 2.5 h of culture, SCFm mRNA is still predominantly expressed (ratio SCFm/SCFs > 1), whereas at 48 and 72 h of culture, SCFs becomes predominant (ratio SCFm/SCFs < 1). The point of equivalence of SCFm and SCFs mRNAs is around 24 h (ratio SCFm/SCFs ≅ 1). The shift of SCF alternative splicing pattern observed in cultured Sertoli cells has led us to look for the mechanisms regulating the presence of exon 6 in mature SCF mRNAs. While testing various culture conditions for their ability to maintain the predominance of SCFm synthesis, we found that the SCFm mRNA synthesis is strikingly dependent on pH. Lowering the culture medium pH by HCl addition or sodium bicarbonate withdrawal prevents the shift to the SCFs mRNA form. Sertoli cells cultured for 48 h at acidic pH (6.3) predominantly expressed SCFm, whereas those cultured at pH 7.2 and pH 7.6 presented an alternative processing in favor of SCFs (Fig.4). Furthermore, kinetic studies show that at pH 6.3, SCFm predominates at each time tested (2 to 72 h), whereas it is progressively replaced by SCFs after culture shift at pH 7.6 (Fig. 5). Indeed, at pH 6.3, at each time tested, the SCFm/SCFs ratio is higher than 1, whereas at pH 7.6, the ratio decreased progressively until 0.6 at 72 h (Fig. 5) The action of low pH on SCFm expression was detected at 12 h and maintained during the other times tested.Figure 5Time course of SCF alternative splicing following pH changes. Sertoli cells were cultured for different times (2 to 72 h) in DME/F12 medium, and the pH was adjusted to 6.3 or 7.6. The histogram in the lower panelrepresents the SCFm/SCFs ratio.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As Sertoli cells are known to produce lactate, an acidic metabolite in the context of Sertoli cell-germ cell metabolic cooperation, this metabolite was tested. As shown in Fig.6, lactate in cultured Sertoli cells maintained the SCFm expression. Indeed, after 48 h of culture in the presence of lactate, the SCFm/SCFs ratio is higher than 1, whereas in the absence of lactate, the ratio is lower than 1 (Fig. 6). Altogether, these results suggested that the trans-acting factors regulating exon 6 skipping are somehow regulated by acidity. In this respect, one must notice that pH remained neutral at the end of the experiment shown in Fig. 3, suggesting that an intracellular factor responsible for the production of SCFm is lost from the Sertoli cells maintained in culture unless an experimental acidification is imposed. As shown in Fig. 7, Sertoli cells cultured at pH 6.3 for 48 h expressed predominantly SCFm (SCFm/SCFs ratio >1), whereas a progressive increase of the SCFs is observed when cycloheximide is added into the culture medium (SCFm/SCFs ratio = 1). This result indicates that protein synthesis is required for sustained production of SCFm at low pH. To test whether exon 6 may be bound by a specific RNA binding factor, [α-32P]UTP RNAs containing exon 6 (SCF567) were cross-linked by UV to nuclear protein extracts from Sertoli cells freshly isolated. A single cross-linked protein-RNA complex was detected, with an apparent molecular mass of 69 kDa (Fig.8 A, lane 1). Competition experiments showed that the 69-kDa complex formation can be prevented by previous addition of an excess of cold RNA containing exon 6 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8 A,lanes 2–4) but not with SCF lacking exon 6 (SCF57) or the unrelated trkB mRNA (Fig. 8 B). The 69-kDa complex is no longer obtained when using RNA probes unrelated to exon 6 as SCF57 or TrkB RNA (data not shown). Altogether, these results suggested the exon 6 sequence specificity of the 69-kDa RNA-binding protein(s). The key role of SCF action in spermatogenesis is dramatically dependent on its membrane-bound localization, as demonstrated by several observations. (i) Adult mutant mice, which express only SCF soluble form (Steel-Dickie mutation (19Brannan C.I. Lyman S.D. Williams D.E. Eisenman J. Anderson D.M. Cosman D. Bedell M.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4671-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar)) or an abnormal SCFm devoid of cytoplasmic domain (Steel 17H mutation with a skipping of exon 8, which encodes the cytoplasmic tail of SCF (25Brannan C.I. Bedell M.A. Resnick J.L. Eppig J.J. Handel M.A. Williams D.E. Lyman S.D. Donovan P.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar)) are infertile; ii) Disruption of spermatogenesis using a Sertoli cell toxicant such as 2,5-hexanedione was accompanied with a switch in alternative splicing from SCFm to SCFs mRNA (26Allard E.K. Blanchard K.T. Boekelheide K. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); iii) In vitro experiments have shown that SCFm promotes anchoring of germ cells to Sertoli cells (11Marziali G. Lazzaro D. Sorrentino V. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as well as proliferation of germ cells (19Brannan C.I. Lyman S.D. Williams D.E. Eisenman J. Anderson D.M. Cosman D. Bedell M.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4671-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). SCF thus provides a striking example for the biological importance of certain post-transcriptional regulations. The aim of the present study was to examine the splicing responsible for the synthesis of SCFm and SCFs during gonadal development and to identify the regulatory mechanisms involved in alternative splicing of SCF pre-mRNA in Sertoli cells. Two other laboratories (11Marziali G. Lazzaro D. Sorrentino V. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C. Grimaldi P. Ricca R. Geremia R. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) have reported, by using RT-PCR approach, the testicular expression of SCFs and SCFm during the post-natal period (but not to the fetal period). These data were conflicting. Rossi et al. (27Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C. Grimaldi P. Ricca R. Geremia R. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) showed that testis from 8 to 13 dpp expressed predominantly SCFm transcripts, whereas 18- to 60-day-old testis expressed the SCFs form. By contrast, Marzialiet al. (11Marziali G. Lazzaro D. Sorrentino V. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showed that at 6 dpp, SCFs and SCFm were equally abundant, whereas SCFm form was predominantly expressed from 12 dpp to the adult period. Because of these discrepancies, we first investigated the developmental pattern in SCF expression during the testicular fetal, postnatal, prepubertal pubertal, and adult periods. Our results, at least in adult animal, appears to correlate with those of Marziali et al. (11Marziali G. Lazzaro D. Sorrentino V. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the fetal mouse testes, we have shown that SCFm mRNAs are predominant at 13 dpc when primordial germ cells proliferate. Indeed, primordial germ cells proliferate from 7.5 to 13 dpc (28Monk M. McLaren A. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1981; 63: 75-84PubMed Google Scholar). Then SCFs mRNAs are predominant at 18 dpc to 2 dpp, when germ cells are quiescent (28Monk M. McLaren A. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1981; 63: 75-84PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, the two SCF forms are likely to play important and distinctive roles during the fetal gonad development. SCFs may promote migration and survival of primordial germ cells, whereas SCFm allows survival and proliferation of primordial germ cells (29Dolci S. Williams D.E. Ernst M.K. Resnick J.L. Brannan C.I. Lock L.F. Lyman S.D. Boswell H.S. Donovan P.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 809-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 30Matsui Y. Toksoz D. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S.-I. Williams D. Zsebo K.M. Hogan B.L.M. Nature. 1991; 353: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Finally, from 8 dpp to adulthood, the SCFm form predominates. The switch from SCFs to SCFm coincides with the first wave of multiplication of spermatogonia, occurring at 6/8 dpp (31Bellvé A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that as soon as Sertoli cells were isolated from their in vivo context, they exhibit a dramatic decline in their ability to synthesize SCFm, suggesting that a factor(s) from their local in vivo environment is required for active exon 6 skipping. We propose that low pH might initiate this process. Indeed, acidity (pH 6.3) was able to maintain SCFm synthesis by cultured Sertoli cells. Our findings were consistent with examples in the literature showing that some cases of pre-mRNA splicing are regulated by pH (32Borsi L. Balza E. Gaggero B. Allemanni G. Zardi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6243-6245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Endo H. Matsuda C. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12488-12493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, in the case of the ATP synthase that is involved in energy production in heart and skeletal muscle tissues, an exon skipping in ATP synthase γ subunit is specifically observed in heart and skeletal muscle but not in the liver (33Endo H. Matsuda C. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12488-12493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether an acidic (micro)environment may occur in Sertoli cells in physiological conditions is still to be established. However, it is of interest to note that, in the testis, lactate is produced in very large amounts by Sertoli cells, to fulfill the energetic requirements of germ cells that are unable to metabolize glucose (34Robinson R. Fritz I.B. Biol. Reprod. 1981; 24: 1032-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Lactate is an energetic substrate preferentially used by post-meiotic germ cells and particularly spermatids (35Jutte N.H.P.M. Grootegoed J.A. Rommerts F.F.G. Clausen O.O.F. Van der Molen H.J. J.

Recently, we have shown that these germ cells control and direct glucose metabolism in Sertoli cells toward lactate formation through some signaling molecules that increase lactate dehydrogenase A (an enzyme that favors the convertion of pyruvate into lactate (36Nehar D. Mauduit C. Boussouar F. Benahmed M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Based on the present observation that in acidic conditions, Sertoli cells preferentially express the SCFm, we hypothesize that at certain specific stages during the seminiferous epithelium cycle, which particularly associates Sertoli cells and spermatids, an acidic microenvironment might be generated by an elevated concentration of lactate. Therefore, lactate synthesis, in addition to supplying spermatids with their energetic substrate, can also, by lowering the pH, allow the synthesis of SCFm that stimulates through c-kit the proliferation of spermatogonia and therefore triggers a new spermatogenic cycle. The hypothesis that terminally differentiated germ cells (spermatids) might send signals to stem germ cells to initiate a new spermatogenic cycle, has been proposed some 40 years ago by Roosen-Runge (37Roosen-Runge E.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1952; 55: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although some candidates (e.g. residual bodies (37Roosen-Runge E.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1952; 55: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) have been suggested as such signals between differentiated and stem germ cells, the precise determining factor remains unknown. This report proposes that an increased acidity through an increase in lactate production at the level of Sertoli cells in contact to spermatids may represent the triggering signal for SCFm expression. To investigate the mechanisms involved in SCF exon 6 skipping in the male gonad, we used as an experimental model, purified mouse Sertoli cells cultured in defined medium and have taken advantage from the observation related to a switch occurring from SCFm to SCFs after 12 h of culture of Sertoli cells. With regard to the mechanisms involved in alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, examples available in the literature indicate that exon skipping is most often the consequence of suboptimal cis elements at the exon-intron boundaries. These weak sites fail to bind components of the basal splicing machinery, including U1 small nuclear RNP (38Kuo H.C. Nassim F.-U. Grabowski P.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 39Chabot B. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and U2AF65 (39Chabot B. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), thus leading to constitutive exon exclusion. Exon inclusion then requires additional trans-acting factors, which specifically recognize the weak exons at the level of so-called splicing enhancers (40Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an opposite situation is likely to occur in the case of SCF. Because our determination of intron sequences surrounding the alternative exon 6 has revealed the presence of 5′ and 3′ intron sequences, exactly fitting the splice site consensus for the major splicing pathway of nuclear pre-mRNA introns (41Tarn W.-Y. Steitz J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 132-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), exon 6 of SCF would be constitutively retained in mature SCF mRNAs by the basal spliceosome. In such a situation, one may hypothesize that an exclusion factor is involved to specifically eliminate exon 6 during the synthesis of SCFs mRNA. This possibility is strongly supported by the fact that de novoprotein synthesis is required for predominant synthesis of SCFm,i.e. for exon 6 elimination. The particularly high degree of sequence conservation of exon 6 during evolution raises the hypothesis that exon 6 RNA sequence may be the target for a sequence-specific RNA binding factor(s). Consistently, cross-linking experiments show that a nuclear protein(s) specifically interacts with SCF alternative exon. Although we have not yet obtained direct evidence that the exon 6-binding 69-kDa complex is the one actually involved in the acidity-mediated splicing, this possibility is highly suggested by the strict sequence conservation of exon 6 between mammals and even birds (42Petitte J.N. Kulik M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), in parallel with the evolutionary conservation of the roles of SCFs and SCFm. Identifying the nuclear protein(s) interacting with SCF exon 6 would be of great interest for elucidating a central turning point of the testis development. We thank Dr. O. Chassande for his generous gift of DNA mouse library."

ABC transporters share extensive sequence homology and are composed of four structural elements: two integral membrane domains and two hydrophilic domains that contain a conserved nucleotide-binding motif (3Doige C.A. Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 291-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 4Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). In the prokaryotic systems, the various domains usually consist of separate polypeptides interacting with each other and forming a membrane-bound complex, whereas in eukaryotes, they are generally fused into a single polypeptide. Among the best studied prokaryotic systems are bacterial periplasmic permeases, which, in addition to the membrane-bound complex, also contain a soluble receptor (the periplasmic substrate-binding protein) that binds the substrate in the periplasm and delivers it to the membrane-bound complex for translocation (5Boos W.

This permease can serve as a good model system for understanding the mechanism of action of ABC transporters in general. The membrane-bound complex of the histidine permease, HisQMP2, 1The abbreviations used are: HisQMP2, membrane-bound complex containing HisQ, HisM, and HisP; LAO, lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding protein; PLS, proteoliposomes. 1The abbreviations used are: HisQMP2, membrane-bound complex containing HisQ, HisM, and HisP; LAO, lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding protein; PLS, proteoliposomes.comprises two integral membrane proteins, HisQ and HisM, and two copies of the nucleotide-binding subunit, HisP. HisQMP2 interacts with the soluble receptor, the histidine-binding protein (HisJ), and another closely related receptor, the lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-bindng protein (LAO) (70% identity with HisJ (12Higgins C.F. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6038-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)). Both HisJ and LAO have been crystallized, and their structure has been determined. Similar to what has been found for the structure of other periplasmic receptors extensively studied (13Quiocho F. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), HisJ and LAO include two globular domains or lobes (lobe I and lobe II) that are far apart in the open unliganded form and close to each other in the closed liganded form. As determined by x-ray crystallography, the switch between the two states involves a large hinged-domain movement in which the two lobes act as rigid globular domains, changing their relative positions dramatically without resulting in significant structural changes within the lobes. The closed liganded form is stabilized by numerous interactions between the ligand and the side chain residues and the peptide backbone from both lobes and by several lobe-lobe interactions via water molecules (14Oh B.-H.

Chem. 1991; 266: 16293-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary investigations have shown that the liganded receptor displays an unexpected conformational plasticity that depends on the nature of the ligand, as was demonstrated using conformation-specific antibodies (8Wolf A. Lee K.C. Kirsch J.F. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21243-21250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Is this property a crucial factor with regard to the mode of interaction between the receptor and HisQMP2 and the subsequent response(s)?In this study, we utilized HisJ proteins mutated in either of the two lobes and wild type HisJ liganded with different substrates to show, using biochemical tools, that each HisJ lobe carries an interaction site, that both lobes are involved in inducing the ATPase activity, and, specifically, that the spatial relationship between the lobes may be one of the factors dictating the efficiency of the induction signal and of translocation. Interestingly, there is a surprising lack of direct correlation between the induced levels of ATPase and the efficiency of translocation. Several of the HisJ residues involved in interaction have been identified, and we show that HisQMP2can distinguish between the various liganded forms of HisJ and adjust accordingly the nature of the signal triggering ATP hydrolysis. Evidence is also provided that the soluble receptor supplies some essential function(s) in translocation that is independent of the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis, because translocation is very poor when ATP hydrolysis is constitutively and maximally expressed, unless HisJ is present.RESULTSBoth Lobes of HisJ Are Involved in the Interaction with HisQMP2It has been speculated in the past, but not proven, that the two structural lobes of HisJ interact physically with separate sites on HisQMP2 (3Doige C.A. Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 291-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 22Wolf A. Shaw E.W. Oh B.-H. De Bondt H. Joshi A.K. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14264-14270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, we provide biochemical evidence in support of this notion, using as a measure of the efficiency of the interaction the in vitro ability of HisJ to stimulate (i) ATP hydrolysis and (ii) transport by HisQMP2. Both in vitro systems use PLS reconstituted with pure HisQMP2and pure receptor, and the concentrations of all components and the energy source can be accurately controlled (10Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Transport is a functional assay of the interaction, whereas ATPase levels directly reflect the nature of the physical interaction between the receptor and the membrane-bound complex. The ATPase activity of HisQMP2responds to receptor, unliganded and liganded, by being induced 2- and 10-fold, respectively (11Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The functions of the two lobes were separated by studying the effect of various residue replacements in each of the lobes on the ability of HisJ to stimulate ATP hydrolysis and induce histidine translocation by HisQMP2. Residues located in solvent-exposed regions on the receptor surface were chosen for analysis because they would be most likely to be directly implicated in interaction and because the corresponding mutant HisJ proteins would be least likely to have an overall structure that is grossly deformed.HisJ Mutations in Lobe IA loop structure (which includes residues 19–25) is evident in lobe I in the high resolution structure of LAO and HisJ (15Oh B.-H. Pandit J. Kang C.-H. Nikaido K. Gokcen S. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11348-11353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that this structure is involved in the interaction with HisQMP2 because of its extensive protrusion from lobe I and of its orientation. To test this hypothesis, the following mutations were introduced by in vitromutagenesis into this region: deletion ΔLys-20–Leu-26, eliminating residues Lys-20 to Leu-26 (hisJΔ9163); single replacement K20E (hisJ9145); and double replacements G24A/E25K (hisJ9164/hisJ9165), K20E/E25K (hisJ9145/hisJ9165), and E18K/E25K (hisJ9166/hisJ9165). Except for E18K/E25K, the corresponding mutant HisJs were determined to have essentially normal binding affinity for histidine (TableI). 2It has been shown that Kdvariations of at least 1 order of magnitude are necessary to affect transport (24Kustu S.G. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6976-6983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, assay of the level of transport in vitro shows that most of the mutants display a level of transport that is different from that of the wild type, being both higher and lower (Fig.1 A; data summarized in TableI). Transport was performed at saturating histidine concentrations, thus eliminating the possibility that minor changes in histidine-binding activity would influence transport activity. Transport was also measured using an in vivo assay based on the ability of auxotrophs to grow on d-histidine as a source of histidine (25Ames G.F.-L. Noel K.D. Taber H. Spudich E.N. Nikaido K. Afong J. Ardeshir F. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and yielded essentially the same results (data not shown). Thus, although the protruding loop is not essential for ligand binding, it is involved in some aspect of transport. Presumably this area of lobe I interacts with the membrane-bound complex and thus may be also involved in the ATPase induction event. Therefore, the level of induction of ATPase activity was determined using saturating concentrations of l-histidine (Fig. 1 B and TableI). Several of the loop-defective HisJs induce levels of ATPase activity that are different than that induced by the wild type and vary similarly to the respective transport activity levels. Deletion ΔLys-20–Leu-26 and double mutant E18K/E25K display ATPase-inducing activities that are considerably lower than that of the wild type, which may account directly for their lower levels of transport. The affinity of these two mutant HisJs was also determined by using a variety of HisJ concentrations to induce the ATPase (data not shown); both have the same affinity for HisQMP2 as wild type HisJ. Therefore, the important distinction can be made that the decreased level of transport and ATP hydrolysis at saturating HisJ concentrations must reflect a defective signaling ability, rather than a defect in the physical interaction. For E18K/E25K, its poorer histidine-bindingK d value might additionally contribute to its poor transport activity. It is interesting to note that K20E/E25K has a higher transport and ATPase-inducing activities than the wild type HisJ, 1.7- and 1.4-fold, respectively. A higher level of transport is also displayed by G24A/E25K despite its normal level of ATP hydrolysis, indicating that the level of ATPase activity is not strictly or exclusively correlated with the level of transport, as will also be discussed later.Table IEffect of mutations in Lobe IMutation in HisJl-Histidine binding (K d)l-Histidine transportaIn vitro l-histidine transport was measured in PLS using purified HisQMP2 and purified HisJ and expressed as nmol/min/mg of HisQMP2.

Open table in a new tab In conclusion, it appears that lobe I interacts with HisQMP2 (at least through the protruding loop), supplies at least part of the signal responsible for inducing the ATPase activity of HisQMP2, and is also involved in some aspect of the transport mechanism.HisJ Mutations in Lobe IIIn the x-ray crystal structure of HisJ, residue Arg-154 in lobe II is surface exposed; it and the loop in lobe I are located on the same side of HisJ as the opening of the histidine-binding pocket (15Oh B.-H. Pandit J. Kang C.-H. Nikaido K. Gokcen S. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11348-11353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier genetic studies had identified a mutation in hisJ, hisJ5625, that allows normal binding but is unable to support transport (24Kustu S.G. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6976-6983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ames G.F.-L. Spudich E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1877-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of mutation hisJ5625 was determined to consist of a replacement of Arg-154 with a cysteine residue (R154C). To confirm the importance and properties of this residue, two additional replacements of Arg-154 (one neutral and one acidic) were created by in vitro mutagenesis: R154S and R154D. Both were shown to bind histidine as well as the wild type does and, like R154C, to be defective in transport (27.Prossnitz, E., In Vitro Reconstitution of the Histidine Transport System of Salmonella typhimurium.Ph.D. thesis, 1989, University of California, Berkeley.Google Scholar). Therefore, Arg-154 is a possible candidate for being involved in an interaction with HisQMP2. Is it also involved in the signaling mechanism? If this were the case, substitution of Arg-154 should affect the levels of in vitrostimulation of the ATPase activity. Therefore, we purified these mutant HisJs and tested them for a variety of properties. First of all, they were tested by physicochemical techniques for not being grossly altered. They were shown to be indistinguishable from wild type HisJ with regard to their tryptophan fluorescence and their UV spectra (data not shown). Thus, in agreement with the fact that Arg-154 is on the surface and with their unchanged affinity for l-histidine, they are unlikely to have major structural alterations. Fig.2 A compares the ability of R154S and R154D to induce the ATPase activity with that of wild type HisJ. Essentially no ATPase was induced by R154S or R154D. The ability to transport was also measured (Fig. 2 B); both are essentially unable to support transport. TableII summarizes these data together with results obtained for other lobe II mutants. As an additional indication of the importance of Arg-154 in interaction, evidence of physical interaction was also obtained by chemical cross-linking to HisQ using formaldehyde (23Ames G.F.-L.

Table II shows that, in contrast to the wild type (and similarly to R154C), cross-linking is essentially absent in R154S and R154D. Thus, it appears that Arg-154 is directly involved in the interaction with HisQMP2.Figure 2Effect of mutations in lobe II of HisJ.

Open table in a new tab In order to determine whether other residues are also part of the interaction site, Asp-149, which is very close to Arg-154 in the three-dimensional structure of HisJ, was replaced by in vitro mutagenesis with alanine or asparagine, and the biochemical properties of the respective mutant HisJs (D149A and D149N) were tested. Similarly to the R154 replacements, both have normal histidine-binding affinity (Table II), yet both are defective in histidine transport (Fig. 2 B and Table II). They are also defective in stimulating ATPase activity, although not completely (Fig.2 A). In addition, both are defective in chemical cross-linking to HisQ, having approximately 40% of the cross-linking efficiency of the wild type (Table II). Thus, residue Asp-149 appears to be involved in the interaction.The fact that several of the properties of D149A and D149N are only partially defective indicates that these mutant proteins are still capable of interacting with HisQMP2, although at a much reduced level. A method was developed to measure the affinity of HisJ for HisQMP2 by measuring the level of ATPase induction using varying concentrations of HisJ (10Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol.

Using this method, D149A was shown to interact with HisQMP2 with an affinity essentially identical to that of wild type HisJ, whereas its maximal level of ATPase induction is 50% of that of the wild type. This result indicates that, similarly to the loop mutants in lobe I, D149A is specifically defective in signaling for ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly, when D149A is greatly overexpressed in strains that also produce wild type HisJ, it inhibits histidine transport in vivo (data not shown). Such a negative dominance characteristic supports the notion that D149A is still able to interact with the membrane-bound complex. Negative dominance was also observed for R154S, R154C, and R154D. Because physical interaction appears to be grossly altered in the Arg-154 replacement mutants, it is possible that the residual interaction observed with these proteins, as expressed by negative dominance, occurs through lobe I. In the case of R154S, it was also found that, despite its inhibition of transport by wild type HisJ, it does not inhibit ATP hydrolysis induced by liganded wild type HisJ (Fig. 3), a result similar to what has been found for wild type unliganded HisJ (11Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because unliganded HisJ has been shown to interact with HisQMP2 (23Ames G.F.-L. Liu C.E. Joshi A.K. Nikaido K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14264-14270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a likely explanation is that the interaction between HisQMP2 and unliganded HisJ or liganded R154S is via lobe I.Figure 3Dominant negative effects of HisJ mutant R154S on transport but not ATP hydrolysis by HisQMP2. A, in vitro l-histidine transport was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods,” in the presence of wild type HisJ and mutant R154S at the indicated concentrations.B, the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis by purified HisQMP2 was assayed at 37 °C in the presence of 6 μm wild type HisJ and various concentrations of mutant HisJ (R154S) as indicated. Both transport and ATPase activity were expressed as percent activity relative to the activity obtained with wild type HisJ alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The α-helical patch on the surface where Arg-154 is located also includes Asp-144, which may also be involved in interaction (15Oh B.-H. Pandit J. Kang C.-H. Nikaido K. Gokcen S. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11348-11353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HisJ mutant D144N transports poorly d-histidine and azaserine (a histidine permease transport substrate). Its ability to be cross-linked to HisQ is also poor (Table II). Thus, it appears that Asp-144 is also part of the interaction site on HisJ. However, it is interesting to note that D144N binds and translocates l-histidine normally, and it can bind azaserine normally, although it cannot translocate it (data not shown). This behavior can be explained if the precise conformation of the closed liganded form were to vary with the nature of the ligand, resulting in efficient translocation if the ligand is l-histidine, but not if it isd-histidine or azaserine. The effect of ligand on conformation is discussed at length below.In contrast to the above mentioned residues, Asp-156, which is very close to Arg-154 and Asp-149 in the three-dimensional structure, does not seem to be involved in the interaction. Replacement of Asp-156 with alanine (D156A) does not result in a significant change in properties, both with respect to ATPase activity, transport, and cross-linking ability (Fig. 2 and Table II). Thus, the region of lobe II where Asp-144, Asp-149, and Arg-154 are located is involved in stimulating the ATPase activity and the region of contact is both small and precisely defined, excluding the nearby residue Asp-156.The Membrane-bound Complex Senses the Spatial Relationship between the Lobes, Which Depends on the Nature of the LigandThe results presented above show that both HisJ lobes are involved in the interaction with HisQMP2. Considering that the loop in lobe I and residues Arg-154 and Asp-149 in lobe II are aligned on the same face of the liganded molecule, it is to be expected that HisQMP2 is capable of interacting with these elements simultaneously. HisQMP2 responds differently to unliganded and histidine-liganded HisJ by inducing different levels of ATPase (11Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and by exhibiting different levels of cross-linking to HisJ; however, the individual surface structures of the two lobes, as is true of other binding proteins (29Quiocho F.A. Wilson D.K. Vyas N.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 30Vyas M.N. Vyas N.K. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4762-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), are essentially unchanged upon ligation (14Oh B.-H. Kang C.-H. De Bondt H. Kim S.-H. Nikaido K. Joshi A. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4135-4143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the relative position of the lobes is an important element in the interaction process that dictates the efficiency of ATP hydrolysis and transport. HisQMP2presumably distinguishes between various receptor forms by “reading” the relative distance between the two lobes or their rotation angles. It has been shown (through the use of conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies) that HisJ assumes measurably different liganded conformations upon binding different ligands (8Wolf A. Lee K.C.

J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). TXA2 is rather labile, being hydrolyzed with half-life of about 30 s in aqueous solution to the biologically inactive thromboxane B2 (2Hamberg M. Svensson J. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2994-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar). This lability indicates that TXA2 is primarily an autocrine or paracrine mediator, acting in the vicinity of its biosynthesis. TXAS was characterized spectrophotometrically as a cytochrome P450 enzyme and was found to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (3Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ruan K.-H. Wang L.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19483-19490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other microsomal P450s that require a P450 reductase as electron donor to catalyze a mono-oxygenation reaction, TXAS catalyzes an isomerization reaction without need for a reductase or other electron donor or for molecular oxygen. Interestingly, TXAS also catalyzes formation of the scission products, 12-l-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) at a ratio of 1:1:1 with TXA2(3Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although TXAS was purified from platelets more than a decade ago, limited information has been obtained about the reaction mechanism or about structural/functional relationships. This is mainly due to the low abundance of the enzyme (∼0.1% of platelet microsomal protein) and the difficulty in purifying sufficient enzyme for kinetic and spectroscopic studies. Conventional chromatography of platelet TXAS was found to have poor yields and reproducibility (3Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoaffinity purification of TXAS was accompanied by loss of >90% of the activity during elution (5Shen R.-F. Tai H.-H. J.

TXAS purified on a high pressure liquid chromatographic, anion exchange column lost its P450 characteristics and became an inactive P420 form (7Jones D.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol.

Several groups have described systems for heterologous expression of TXAS. In prokaryotic expression systems, fusion of TXAS with glutathione S-transferase produced a protein of the correct size but that was enzymatically inactive (4Ruan K.-H. Wang L.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19483-19490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); insertion of TXAS cDNA into a common P450 expression vector, pCW, resulted in a very low yield of recombinant protein (13Xia Z. Tai H.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic expression systems, plasmid-directed transient expression in COS-1 cells and baculovirus-driven expression in Sf9 cells generated enzymatically active TXAS but in amounts insufficient for spectroscopic studies (4Ruan K.-H.

Here, we report development of a high level bacterial expression system for human TXAS and a rapid and reproducible purification procedure that affords milligram levels of active enzyme suitable for detailed biophysical and biochemical characterization. Nickel-nitrilotriacetate agarose (Ni-NTA) was obtained from Qiagen. DEAE-Sephacel and octyl-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PGH2 was purchased from Biomol, and the stable PGH2 analog, U44069 (15-hydroxy-9,11-[epoxymethano]prosta-5,13-dienoic acid), was from Cayman. Imidazole, 1-phenylimidazole, 1-butylimidazole, 2-phenylimidazole, 4-phenylimidazole, pyridine, 4-ethylpyridine, 3,5-lutidine, pyrimidine, 2-aminopyrimidine, and 4-methylpyrimidine were from Aldrich. Clotrimazole (1-[o-chloro-α,α-diphenylbenzyl]imidazole) and miconazole (1-[2,4-dichloro-β-([2,4-dichlorobenzyl]-oxy)phenyl]imidazole) were obtained from Sigma. Emulgen 913 was a gift from Kao Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan. The pCW and pT-groE expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Amy Roth (University of Oregon) and Dr. Shunsuke Ishii (Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Ibaraki, Japan), respectively. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the human TXAS cDNA, isolated from a lung cDNA library (8Ohashi K. Ruan K.-H. Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 789-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sense primers were designed to introduce the initiator codon ATG within an NdeI site and to make desired truncations of the TXAS amino-terminal region,e.g. by replacing amino acid residues 1–28 with an 8-residue segment (MALLLAVF) favoring expression in Escherichia coli (15Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The antisense primers were designed to add aBglII site near the carboxyl terminus, with or without a 4-histidine terminal segment to facilitate protein purification. Individual polymerase chain reaction products were digested withNdeI and BglII and ligated into the corresponding restriction enzyme sites of the pCW plasmid, which uses thetac promoter to drive expression (16Gegner J.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The resultant amino- and carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences of recombinant TXAS are listed in Table I. Plasmids were transformed into a protease-deficientE. coli strain BL21(DE3) containing the chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid pT-groE (17Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T.

Proteins in the supernatant were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the TXAS expression levels were estimated by Coomassie staining and immunoblot analyses. Typically, an overnight culture (20 ml) was inoculated into 1 liter of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in a shaker at 200 rpm until the Klett reading reached 100–140. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) and δ-aminolevulinic acid (0.5 mm) were then added, and the culture was continued at 160 rpm for 20 h at 30 °C before harvesting. The pelleted cells were kept at −70 °C until protein purification. Harvested cells (17 g from 5 liters of culture medium) were resuspended in 90 ml of Buffer A (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 m NaCl) containing 50 μg/ml DNase, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell at 14,000 pounds/square inch. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell homogenates were stirred for 60 min with 1% Emulgen 913 to solubilize the TXAS. The suspension was then centrifuged at 18,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant containing solubilized TXAS was diluted to 200 ml with Buffer A and applied to a Ni-NTA column (1.5 × 5 cm) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of Buffer A, then with 10 column volumes of Buffer B (0.02 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.02% of Emulgen 913, and 10% glycerol) containing 5 mm histidine, and then with 5 column volumes of Buffer B containing 10 mmhistidine to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. TXAS was eluted with Buffer B containing 40 mm histidine. The brown-colored fractions were pooled and loaded on a DEAE-Sephacel column (1.5 × 3 cm) pre-equilibrated with Buffer B. The flow-through fractions, which contained the majority of the TXAS activity, were collected and applied to an octyl-Sepharose column (1.5 × 3 cm) pre-equilibrated with Buffer C (0.02 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.5 m NaCl. The column was washed with 10 volumes of the same buffer and then with 10 volumes of Buffer C. TXAS was eluted with Buffer C containing 0.2% Emulgen 913 and stored at −70 °C until used. The level of recombinant TXAS expression was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining after separation of proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions; the identity of TXAS was confirmed by Western blot analysis using antiserum raised against a glutathione transferase-TXAS fusion protein (4Ruan K.-H. Wang L.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19483-19490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heme content was determined by the formation of pyridine hemochromogen (18Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified TXAS (∼150 μg) was incubated in 0.15 m NaOH and 1.8m pyridine and then reduced by addition of a few grains of dithionite. Absorbance differences at 556 nm and 540 nm were recorded for the reduced and oxidized heme pyridine complexes. A difference extinction coefficient of 24 mm−1cm−1 (reduced minus oxidized forms) was used for calculation of heme concentration. Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (19Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). TXAS was also quantified for total number of tryptophan residues by magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) usingl-tryptophan as standard (A 282 = 5500 m−1 cm−1) (20Holmquist B. Valee B.L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). TXAS activity was routinely measured by a coupled assay as follows. Purified sheep prostaglandin H synthase (about 1000 units; Ref. 21Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8760-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was mixed with TXAS in 190 μl of 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1 μm hemin at 23 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of 1.2 mm arachidonic acid (in ethanol) and continued for 3 min before stopping with 5 μl of 2 n HCl. The reaction mixture was neutralized with 20 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, prior to the radioimmunoassay for thromboxane B2 (22Wu K.K. LeBreton G.C. Tai H.-H. Chen Y.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the stable hydration product of TXA2. To obtainK m and V max values, PGH2 in a small volume of isopropyl alcohol was added directly to TXAS in 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5. UV-Vis absorbance spectra were recorded with an HP8452 diode array spectrophotometer or a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer. Reduced CO difference spectra were obtained by treating the protein with dithionite and then purging the sample cuvette with carbon monoxide. Heme ligand perturbation spectra were obtained by titration of the protein with a concentrated stock solution of ligand. Dissociation constants (K d) were calculated by fitting the peak-trough amplitudes from the perturbation difference spectra and the corresponding ligand concentrations to a one-site hyperbolic binding model (23Berka V. Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33293-33300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). MCD spectra were obtained at room temperature using a Jasco J-500C spectrometer with a 1.3 Tesla electromagnet calibrated with camphor sulfonic acid and potassium ferricyanide (24Vickery L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 65: 284-302Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded at liquid helium temperature on a Varian E-6 spectrometer with an Air Products liquid helium transfer line (25Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Chen P.-F. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32563-32571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). EPR parameters, including g values, V and D, the rhombic and axial ligand field terms for low spin heme complexes, and the ratio of rhombic (E) and axial (D) ligand field components for high spin heme complexes, were determined as described previously (25Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Chen P.-F. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32563-32571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Expression of human TXAS in E. coli was assessed for various TXAS cDNA constructs. Initially, full-length, wild-type TXAS cDNA was ligated into the pCW vector, a system that has been widely used in the heterologous bacterial expression of other P450s (26Waterman M.R. Jenkins C.H. Pikuleva I. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82/83: 807-813Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Coomassie staining and immunoblot analysis indicated that the full-length construct yielded low levels of expression in E. coli (TableI), similar to results with other unmodified P450 cDNAs (27Gonzalez F.J. Korzekwa K.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 369-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In light of earlier results with P450c17 expression in E. coli (28Imai T. Globerman H. Gertner J.M. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19681-19689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we modified the TXAS cDNA by progressive truncation of the amino-terminal sequence and insertion of the amino-terminal sequence MALLLAVF. In some constructs, 4 histidine residues were added at the carboxyl terminus to facilitate protein purification. Five constructs, with deletion of residues 1–3, 1–24, 1–28, 1–59 or 1–65, were each found to be expressed to some degree in E. coli strain JM109 (Table I). The highest levels were obtained with deletion of residues 1–28 (Δ1–28), and addition of the histidine tag to the Δ1–28 construct did not affect the expression level. Previous studies have shown that deletion of the first 28 amino acid residues had little effect on TXAS activity (13Xia Z. Tai H.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Δ1–28 TXAS construct with a modified P450C17 amino terminus sequence and a histidine tag at the carboxyl terminus, termed pCW-TXAS(Δ1–28)mod(His)4, was used for further studies. Immunoblot analyses indicated that the majority of recombinant TXAS protein expressed from pCW-TXAS(Δ1–28)mod(His)4 in JM109 was insoluble even after treatment with detergents Emulgen 913, Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, cholate, or Lubrol, presumably reflecting misfolded protein in inclusion bodies. To improve the production of properly folded TXAS, we utilized a co-expression system in which TXAS was expressed along with chaperonins groES and groEL in the protease-deficient BL21 host strain. These changes increased the yield of detergent-soluble recombinant TXAS by at least 2-fold (data not shown). The expression of chaperonins is under the control of T7 polymerase, which is induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in the BL21 cells. Upon induction, production of groES (10 kDa), groEL (60 kDa), and recombinant TXAS (56 kDa) were greatly increased. About 80% of the total TXAS activity in the homogenate was found in the membrane fraction, indicating that enzymatically active recombinant TXAS was properly integrated in membrane. To facilitate purification, TXAS was routinely solubilized with 1% Emulgen 913 directly from the cell extract, without isolation of the membrane fraction. A protocol that includes chromatography on Ni-NTA, DEAE-Sephacel, and octyl-Sepharose was developed for purification of recombinant TXAS, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Typical results are presented in TableII and Fig.1. The Ni-NTA affinity column step produced the most dramatic purification, increasing the TXAS specific activity by ∼30-fold. The pooled TXAS fractions from Ni-NTA column did not bind to the DEAE-Sephacel column, whereas some major contaminants were retained. The octyl-Sepharose chromatography had little effect on the TXAS specific activity, but it served to concentrate the samples and remove histidine carried over from Ni-NTA chromatography. The final TXAS fraction was nearly homogeneous as judged from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 A), and the identity of the recombinant protein was confirmed as TXAS by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 B). Overall, the recombinant TXAS was purified about 100-fold, with a yield near 14%.Table IIPurification of recombinant TXAS from E. coliStepProteinSpecific activityYieldmgnmol TXB2/min/mg protein%Homogenate267029.7100Detergent extract178038.187Ni-NTA column18.4109026DEAE column4.64280017Octyl column3.72295014Values shown are for a typical run for materials from 5 liters of culture medium with the pCW-TXAS(Δ1–28)mod(His)4 construct co-expressed with chaperonins groES and groEL.

The purified recombinant TXAS was found to be catalytically active, with aK m of 20 μm PGH2 and aV max of 12 μmol of TXA2/min/mg of protein at 23 °C. To determine the stoichiometric ratio of TXA2, HHT, and MDA formed by the recombinant TXAS, PGH2 was added to the enzyme, and the absorption spectra were followed as a function of incubation time (Fig.2). Formation of HHT and MDA, as indicated by the absorption maxima at 234 and 268 nm, respectively, was observed in the presence of TXAS but not in the control (data not shown). At the end of the reaction, an aliquot was withdrawn and assayed quantitatively for the TXA2 degradation product, thromboxane B2. On the basis of the known extinction coefficients of HHT (33 mm−1 cm−1at 234 nm) and MDA (31.5 mm−1cm−1 at 268 nm) (29Hecker M. Haurand M. Ullrich V. Diczfalusy U. Hammarstrom S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 124-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the molar ratio of TXA2:HHT:MDA formed by the recombinant TXAS was calculated to be 0.94:1.0:0.93, consistent with published results using purified platelet TXAS (3Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heme content of the purified recombinant TXAS determined by pyridine-hemochromogen analysis was 0.72 ± 0.06 mol of heme/mol of TXAS, indicating that some 70% of the purified recombinant protein was present as the holoenzyme. This is not due to the inaccuracy of protein quantitation since results from bicinchoninic acid assay and noninvasive MCD quantitation for tryptophan residues were consistent. The purified TXAS exhibited an electronic spectrum typical for low spin cytochrome P450, with a Soret maximum at 418 nm and α and β bands at 567 and 535 nm, respectively (Fig.3). The heme-carbon monoxide complex of dithionite-reduced TXAS had a major peak at 450 nm, and minor peaks at 420 nm and 546 nm, similar to the reduced CO spectrum reported for purified platelet TXAS (3Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The small fraction of 420 nm species in the reduced heme-CO spectrum in Fig. 3 is probably not an inactive P420 form of TXAS because complete conversion to the 450 nm species was observed in the presence of methyl viologen, a mediator dye (data not shown). The difference spectrum between the reduced heme-CO complex and resting TXAS highlights the 450 nm peak, characteristic of cytochrome P450 (Fig. 3). To evaluate the effects of axial ligands on the TXAS heme behavior, UV-Vis and MCD spectroscopy were used to characterize resting TXAS and TXAS complexed with U44069 (O-based ligand) or imidazole (N-based ligand). As shown in Fig.4 A, resting TXAS had optical absorbance peaks at 360 (46.2 mm−1cm−1), 418 (100 mm−1cm−1), 535 (13.6 mm−1cm−1), 567 (12.3 mm−1cm−1), and 655 (4.9 mm−1cm−1) nm. The U44069 complex exhibited a blue-shifted Soret peak at 414 nm (101 mm−1cm−1) and bands in the visible region at 531.5 (12.7 mm−1 cm−1), 563 (12.5 mm−1 cm−1), and 652 (4.7 mm−1 cm−1) nm. In contrast, imidazole ligation of the TXAS yielded a bathochromic shift in the electronic spectrum, with peaks at 424 (97.4 mm−1 cm−1) and 540 (4.4 mm−1 cm−1) nm. These spectra are typical for low spin P450 hemoproteins in both peak positions and amplitude (30Dawson J.H. Dooley D.M. Lever A.B.P. Gray H.B. Iron Porphyrins. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1989: 1-131Google Scholar). The MCD spectra for TXAS shown in Fig. 4 Bdisplay standard features typical for a low spin P450 heme with the symmetric Soret crossovers closely matching the electronic absorbance peaks. The two marker MCD bands at 556.1 and 520.7 nm in the visible region for resting TXAS and its complex with imidazole (560.7 and 526.5 nm) or U44069 (549.9 and 515.1 nm) are very similar to those seen with low-spin P450cam, chloroperoxidase (31Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and nitric oxide synthase (32Sono M. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Dawson J.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6136-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), each of which has a proximal thiolate ligand. The lack of significant features in the 600–700 nm region of the MCD spectrum (Fig. 4 B) indicated that the TXAS complexes were primarily low spin in nature. X-band EPR spectra of TXAS derivatives were measured at liquid helium temperature. Except for some nonspecific signals at g = 4.3 (adventitious iron) and at g = 2 (organic radicals), we only observed signals for low spin heme.

This study describes a novel, metabolic effect of exogenous ATP in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. In these quiescent (i.e. noncontracting) cells, micromolar concentrations of ATP depressed the rate of basal, catecholamine-stimulated, or insulin-stimulated glucose transport by up to 60% (IC50 for inhibition of insulin-dependent glucose transport, 4 μm). ATP decreased the amount of glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT4) in the plasma membrane, with a concomitant increase in intracellular microsomal membranes. A similar glucose transport inhibition was produced by P2 purinergic agonists with the following rank of potencies: ATP ≈ ATPγS ≈ 2-methylthio-ATP (P2Y-selective) > ADP > α,βmeATP (P2X-selective), whereas the P1 purinoceptor agonist adenosine was ineffective. The effect of ATP was suppressed by the poorly subtype-selective P2 antagonist pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid but, surprisingly, not by the nonselective antagonist suramin nor by the P2Y-specific Reactive Blue 2. Glucose transport inhibition by ATP was not affected by a drastic reduction of the extracellular concentrations of calcium (down to 10−9m) or sodium (down to 0 mm), and it was not mimicked by a potassium-induced depolarization, indicating that purinoceptors of the P2X family (which are nonselective cation channels whose activation leads to a depolarizing sodium and calcium influx) are not involved. Inhibition was specific for the transmembrane transport of glucose because ATP did not inhibit (i) the rate of glycolysis under conditions where the transport step is no longer rate-limiting nor (ii) the rate of [1-14C]pyruvate decarboxylation. In conclusion, extracellular ATP markedly inhibits glucose transport in rat cardiomyocytes by promoting a redistribution of glucose transporters from the cell surface to an intracellular compartment. This effect of ATP is mediated by P2 purinoceptors, possibly by a yet unknown subtype of the P2Y purinoceptor family. ATP is known to act as an extracellular signal in many organs.

This effect of ATP is mediated by P2 purinoceptors, possibly by a yet unknown subtype of the P2Y purinoceptor family. It is well established that ATP acts as an extracellular signal in many tissues and is involved in a variety of regulatory processes including the control of vascular tone, muscle contraction, pain, or neuronal communication (for review see Ref. 1Burnstock G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In particular, ATP serves as a neurotransmitter or co-transmitter in central, as well as in peripheral neurons (1Burnstock G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 2Bean B.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 87-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For instance, ATP is co-released with noradrenaline or acetylcholine from sympathetic or parasympathetic nerve endings, respectively, and even from neuromuscular synapses (1Burnstock G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Another source of extracellular ATP is that released from parenchymal cells under hypoxic or ischemic conditions (3Skobel E. Kammermeier H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Many biological responses to ATP are mediated via P2purinoceptors, which belong to either of two structurally and functionally distinct families of receptors: ligand-gated, nonselective cation channels (P2X-type), or G-protein-coupled receptors linked to the phospholipase C signaling cascade (P2Y-type) (1Burnstock G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 4Burnstock G. CIBA Found. Symp. 1996; 198: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of P2X receptors leads to sodium and calcium influx and to cell depolarization and is therefore stimulatory in nature (e.g. it causes smooth muscle cell contraction). Although P2Y purinoceptor activation also results in an increased cytosolic calcium concentration (at least in part via inositoltrisphosphate-mediated calcium release), it induces both stimulatory and inhibitory effects (the latter through the opening of potassium channels or indirectly through nitric oxide production). In the heart, extracellular ATP and ATP analogues were found to exert pronounced although relatively complex effects on coronary tone and mechanical activity, depending on the type of preparation studied and on the purine concentrations used (5Burnstock G. Meghji P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 79: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Legssyer A. Poggioli J. Renard D. Vassort G. J. Physiol.

By contrast, it is not known whether ATP may also impinge on cardiomyocyte metabolism, whose regulation often closely matches the changes in energy demand and contractile status. The aim of the present investigation was therefore to investigate possible effects of ATP and other purinergic agents on the trans-sarcolemmal transport and utilization of glucose that, besides fatty acids and lactate, represents an essential substrate in cardiac myocytes. In these studies, we observed a pronounced inhibitory action of purinergic agonists on the rate of glucose transport and explored the underlying mechanisms. All chemicals were of the highest purity grade available. Chemicals for media used for cell isolation and the glucose transport assay were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), except for bovine serum albumin (fraction V, fatty acid-free), which was from Boehringer Mannheim. All nucleotides (except 2MeSATP), 1The abbreviations used are: 2MeSATP, 2-methylthio-ATP; dGlc, 2-deoxy-d-glucose; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); α, βmeATP, α,β-methylene-ATP; PPADS, pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid; LDM, low density microsomes; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene. adenosine, andl-phenylephrine were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany); dichloroacetic acid was from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany); 2-methylthioadenosine triphosphate, pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid, suramin, and Reactive Blue 2 were from RBI (Biotrend, Cologne, Germany); purified bovine insulin was a kind gift from Prof. Axel Wollmer (Aachen, Germany). 2-Deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (glucose transport assay), [3-3H]-d-glucose (glycolytic measurements), [1-14C]-pyruvic acid (pyruvate oxidation assay), and ECL (Western blots) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Braunschweig, Germany). The antiserum used to immunodetect GLUT4 (OSCRX) was a kind gift from Prof. A. Zorzano (Barcelona, Spain), and that against GLUT1 was purchased from Biogenesis Inc. (Quartett, Berlin, Germany). Cardiomyocytes from adult, female Sprague-Dawley rats (220–250 g, fed ad libitum) were obtained as described previously (21Fischer Y. Rose H. Kammermeier H. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, treatment of cardiomyocytes (∼1.5 mg protein/sample) was performed in medium A (6 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.4 mmMgSO4, 128 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, and 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) at 37 °C, equilibrated with 100% oxygen. The rates of carrier-mediated 2-deoxy-d-glucose (dGlc) uptake were determined over a period of 30 min as described (21Fischer Y. Rose H. Kammermeier H. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the experiments examining the relevance of ionic gradients (see Fig. 3), cardiomyocytes were incubated in media whose composition was identical to medium A, except that the concentration of the ion to be tested was varied as indicated in the figure. All the media used were isotonic; thus sodium was replaced by an equimolar amount of choline (see Fig. 3 A), potassium was replaced by sodium (see Fig. 3 C), or chloride was replaced by HEPES (see Fig. 3 D). The calcium concentration was adjusted according to the method of Fabiato and Fabiato (22Fabiato A. Fabiato A. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig.3 B). The experiments in which the sodium concentration was lowered (see Fig. 3 A) were performed at a calcium concentration of 10−7m to avoid a calcium overload of the cells due to impairment of the sodium-dependent calcium extrusion via the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. The flux through the 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase reaction was estimated by measuring the rate of 3H2O formation from [3-3H]glucose with a protocol adapted from Ref. 23Hue L. Hers H.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 58: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. In brief, cardiomyocytes were treated (with or without ATP and insulin) as described in the legend of Fig. 5 before [3-3H]glucose (0.75 μCi/sample) was added for 30 min at 37 °C. The incubation was then stopped with perchloric acid (0.3m). The extracts were neutralized with KOH/KHCO3, and the tritiated water glycolytically formed was separated on Dowex-borate columns (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) as described (23Hue L. Hers H.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 58: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The amount of nonspecific 3H2O (i.e. that which is not related to the glycolytic activity of the myocytes) was determined by adding perchloric acid to a parallel set of cell samples prior to the incubation with [3-3H]glucose. Flux through the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was determined by monitoring the production of14CO2 from [1-14C]pyruvate as described (24Fischer Y. Böttcher U. Eblenkamp M. Thomas J. Jüngling E. Rösen P. Kammermeier H. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, cardiomyocytes were exposed to the experimental conditions to be investigated (ATP and/or insulin treatment) at 37 °C in 20-ml vials sealed with rubber stoppers (under the same conditions as for the glucose transport assays,i.e. in a total volume of 1.5 ml and with ∼1.5 mg cell protein/sample). The oxidation reaction was then started by injecting 0.1 μCi of [1-14C]pyruvate (final concentration, 0.1 mm) into the cell suspension. After another 10 min at 37 °C, the incubation was terminated by injecting 300 μl of 0.3n perchloric acid. The released14CO2 was trapped (over 18 h at 4 °C) in 0.3 ml ethanolamine/ethylene glycol (1:1, v/v) contained in a polypropylene center well (placed in the vials before the incubations). Nonspecific values (determined by injecting perchloric acid in parallel cell samples before adding [1-14C]pyruvate) were subtracted from all samples. The quenching caused by the ethanolamine/ethylene glycol mixture was determined in each experiment and taken into account for the calculation of pyruvate oxidation rates. Cardiomyocytes were treated as detailed in the legend of Fig. 4 and then rapidly washed once with TES buffer (20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mmsucrose, 0.1 mm (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen in a ratio of 107cells/2.7 ml of TES.

The curves shown in Fig. 1, as well as the IC50values of glucose transport inhibition, were obtained from the dGlc transport data using a computer program (Prism) from GraphPad Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA), according to the following equation. Y=[Ymin+(Ymax−Ymin)]/[1+10((logIC50−X)·S)]Equation 1 where X is the logarithm of agonist concentration,Y min and Y max are the minimum and maximum dGlc transport rates, IC50 is the agonist concentration producing a half-maximal inhibition, andS the Hill slope of the curves. For the statistical tests used to assess the difference of data sets, see the figure legends. Glucose transport is the first step and under many physiological conditions the rate-limiting step of myocardial glucose utilization and is known to be the target of a host of regulatory factors in heart muscle cells, such as insulin, catecholamines, contraction, anoxia, ischemia, or alternative substrates (24Fischer Y.

In an initial series of experiments, we therefore investigated the action of purinergic agonists on cardiomyocyte glucose transport. As documented in Table I, ATP produced a substantial inhibition of glucose transport in basal (nonstimulated) myocytes, as well as in cells stimulated with insulin or with the α1-adrenergic agent phenylephrine. The effect of ATP was rapid; thus the extent of inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport was the same, regardless of whether ATP was added to the cells 30, 20, 10, or 0 min before or even 2 min after insulin addition (not shown).Table IEffects of adenine nucleotides on dGlc uptake in cardiomyocytesAdditionsRate of dGlc uptakePercentagepBasal (nonstimulated)15.5 ± 1.0 (32)100+ Adenosine (100 μm)17.2 ± 1.6 (3)104>0.05+ ATP (30 μm)5.8 ± 0.9 (6)37<0.001Insulin203.1 ± 10.8 (31)100+ Adenosine (100 μm)200.0 ± 2.0 (3)98>0.05+ ATP (30 μm)102.0 ± 10.0 (13)51<0.01+ ADP (100 μm)149.3 ± 5.9 (4)74<0.01+ ATPγS (30 μm)114.5 ± 16.3 (3)58<0.01+ α,βmeATP (100 μm)152.8 ± 20.8 (4)75<0.01+ 2MeSATP (100 μm)123.5 ± 19.9 (5)58<0.01+ NADH (100 μm)161.1 ± 6.4 (4)79<0.01+ NAD+ (100 μm)163.4 ± 13.7 (4)81<0.05+ NADPH (100 μm)162.3 ± 11.3 (3)86>0.05+ NADP+ (100 μm)159.9 ± 7.6 (3)84>0.05+ UTP (100 μm)214.2 (2)106Phenylephrine90.6 ± 6.6 (5)100+ ATP (30 μm)33.4 ± 3.4 (5)37<0.001Cardiomyocytes were incubated for 10 min (at 37 °C in medium A) with or without nucleotides at the indicated concentrations before insulin (12 nm) or phenylephrine (120 μm) were added for another 30 min. In another series of samples, cells were treated for 60 min with oligomycin B (0.6 μm) in the presence or absence of ATP.

Similarly, other purine nucleotides known to mainly interact with P2 purinoceptors (2Bean B.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 87-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) efficiently depressed glucose transport; thus addition of ATP and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues (ATPγS1, 2MeSATP, and α,βmeATP) at micromolar concentrations resulted in a decrease in insulin-dependent glucose transport by up to ∼50%. Inhibitory effects were also observed with other purine nucleotides such as ADP, NADH, and NAD+ (Table I); NADPH and NADP+ also tended to inhibit glucose transport, although these effects did not quite reach statistical significance (Table I). By contrast, adenosine (100 μm), which preferentially activates members of the P1 purinoceptor family, had no effect on the basal or on the insulin-stimulated rate of glucose transport (Table I). In an attempt to discriminate the potential P2 receptor type involved, we examined the concentration dependence of the effects of some of the above agonists. As illustrated in Fig.1, the P2-subtype nonselective agonists ATP, ATPγS, and ADP were effective in the low micromolar range (IC50 = 4.0 ± 0.7, 5.4 ± 1.5, and 7.8 ± 3.4 μm, respectively). The P2Y-selective analogue 2MeSATP (31Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) also produced a significant inhibition (p < 0.001) at 1–10 μm, but higher concentrations than with ATP or ATPγS were required to reach a maximal degree of inhibition (Fig. 1); in this case the dose-response relationship could not be fitted to a simple sigmoidal function. The selective P2X purinoceptor agonist α,βmeATP (31Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) was clearly less potent (with an apparent IC50 of ∼100 μm) (Fig. 1). UTP, which specifically activates so-called P2U purinoceptors (which belong to the P2Y family and are also expressed in the myocardium; Ref. 32Webb T.E. Boluyt M.O. Barnard E.A. J. Auton. Pharmacol. 1996; 16: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was without effect at a concentration as high as 100 μm (Table I). A second approach aimed to address the question of the P2-type mediating the inhibiting effect of ATP was to use purinoceptor antagonists. Surprisingly, neither did the P2Y-specific antagonist Reactive Blue (31Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) nor suramin, which is known to antagonize the binding of agonists to and the activation of both P2X and P2Y purinoceptors (31Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), affect the decrease in glucose transport brought about by ATP (Fig. 2). By contrast, the poorly subtype-selective antagonist pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS, 100 μm; Ref. 33Lambrecht G. J. Auton. Pharmacol. 1996; 16: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suppressed the ATP-dependent inhibition of glucose transport (Fig. 2). It should also be mentioned that the effect of ATP (30 μm) was not influenced by the P1 receptor antagonists 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine, or 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (100 μm each) (not shown). Because the pharmacological data presented above were not sufficient to clearly define or exclude either P2X or P2Y receptors as the mediator of the effect of ATP on glucose transport, we considered the possible involvement of the former purinoceptor type by using a functional approach. P2X purinoceptors are nonselective cation channels whose activation produces a depolarizing inward sodium and calcium current (1Burnstock G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 2Bean B.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 87-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Burnstock G. CIBA Found. Symp. 1996; 198: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the influence of trans-sarcolemmal ionic gradients on the inhibition of glucose transport by ATP. To this end, we modified the composition of the incubation medium with respect to sodium, calcium, and potassium over a wide range of concentrations (while keeping the osmolarity constant). The results of this series of experiments are summarized in Fig.3. Even a reduction of the extracellular sodium concentration to nominally 0 mm (Fig. 3 A) or of the free calcium concentration down to 10−9m (Fig. 3 B) did not suppress the ATP-induced glucose transport inhibition. It is noteworthy that the basal rate of glucose transport (in the absence of ATP) significantly rose when the calcium level was lowered from the physiological value of 10−3m (Fig. 3); conversely, we had previously found that an increase in calcium from 1 to 5 mm depresses the rate of glucose transport in these cells (34Fischer Y. Kamp J. Thomas J. Pöpping S. Rose H. Carpéné C. Kammermeier H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1211-C1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence it appears that calcium exerts an inhibiting influence of the glucose transport system of cardiomyocytes. However, our present data (Fig. 3,A and B) show that the action of ATP on glucose transport is not dependent on extracellular calcium and sodium, thus ruling out that a depolarizing influx of these ions could mediate the action of the nucleotide. In addition, depolarization with 30 mm potassium chloride (in the absence of ATP) did not produce an inhibition of glucose transport (Fig. 3 C,open bars). Since purinoceptor activation was also shown to activate cardiac potassium channels (18Babenko A.P. Vassort G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Friel D.D. Bean B.P. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 415: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we also examined the possible influence of the potassium gradient across the plasma membrane. As shown in Fig.3 C (closed bars), ATP significantly reduced the rate of glucose transport at all tested potassium concentrations, although the percentage of inhibition tended to be smaller at 0.6 mm potassium. However, such a low potassium concentration may limit the function of the Na+/K+-ATPase,i.e. of Na+ extrusion, thus impairing Ca2+ efflux or even promoting Ca2+ influx via the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, which would eventually result in an increased cytosolic Ca2+concentration. We therefore also studied the effect of ATP at a very low extracellular Ca2+ concentration (10−7m) (at which the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is not required to maintain a low cytosolic calcium concentration). We found that ATP inhibited glucose transport by 57 ± 7% even in the complete absence of extracellular potassium (two independent experiments; not shown). Moreover, the effect of ATP (as tested at 6 mm potassium and 1 mm Ca2+) was not affected by the potassium channel blockers Tedisamil, Apamin, or Glibenclamide (3–10 μm): thus, in the presence of these inhibitors, the percentage of inhibition by ATP was 48 ± 1%, 37 ± 16%, and 49 ± 2%, respectively (n = 2–3). In conclusion, we found no indication that the trans-sarcolemmal potassium gradient or potassium channels may be relevant to the action of ATP on glucose uptake. Finally, it was reported that in cardiomyocytes ATP activates trans-sarcolemmal bicarbonate/chloride exchange (10Puceat M. Clement O. Vassort G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 444: 241-256Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Kaneda M. Fukui K. Doi K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 111: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore also investigated the influence of the extracellular chloride concentration on the effect of the nucleotide on glucose transport. As illustrated in Fig. 3 D, this parameter"
https://openalex.org/W1976183129,"A gene encoding a serine-type protease has been cloned from Aquifex pyrophilus using a sequence tag containing the consensus sequence of proteases as a probe. Sequence analysis of the cloned gene reveals an open reading frame of 619 residues that has three canonical residues (Asp-140, His-184, and Ser-502) that form the catalytic site of serine-type proteases. The size of the mature form (43 kDa) and its localization in the cell wall fraction indicate that both the NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences of the protein are processed during maturation. When the cloned gene is expressed in Escherichia coli, it is weakly expressed as active and processed forms. The pH optimum of this protease is very broad, and its activity is completely inactivated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The half-life of the protein is 6 h at 105 °C, suggesting that it is one of the most heat-stable proteases. The cysteine residues in the mature form may form disulfide bonds that are responsible for the strong stability of this protease, because the thermostability of the protein is significantly reduced in the presence of reducing reagent.

Hyperthermophiles are organisms that grow optimally at 80 °C or higher temperatures. Ever since they were identified at various geothermal locations, there has been interest in their evolutionary significance as well as their ability to thrive at temperatures in which normal proteins would be denatured. From the ability to grow autotrophically at high temperature and their position in the deepest branch of the phylogenetic tree, hyperthermophiles are presumed to be the closest living descendants of a universal ancestor of life (1Olson G.J. Woese C.R. Overbeek R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4465) Google Scholar). Except for two genera of eubacteria, Aquifex andThermotoga, all identified hyperthermophiles belong to Archaea. Most of them are grouped as autotrophs that use inorganic materials such as carbon and nitrogen sources or heterotrophs that exploit organic materials as nutrients (3Stetter K.O. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 149-158Crossref Google Scholar). To degrade exogenous organic compounds, heterotrophic hyperthermophiles have various hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases and glycosidases. Autotrophic organisms also contain proteases that may be involved in cellular processes. The proteases from hyperthermophiles have been studied for their biotechnological applications as well as for their metabolic significance (4Bauer M.W. Halio S.B. Kelly R.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 48: 271-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the existing types of proteases such as serine-, thiol-, or acid-type proteases, the majority of them belong to a family of serine-type proteases (5Cowan D.A. Smolenski K.A. Daniel R.M. Morgan H.W. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Eggen R. Geerling R.A. Watts J. de Vos W.M. FEMS Microbiol.

Some of them are processed from a preprotein to a mature form and are localized at the cell wall or are secreted. These proteases show heat stability or are resistant to a high concentration of denaturing agents. The half-life measured at around 100 °C varied from a few minutes for archaelysin (5Cowan D.A. Smolenski K.A. Daniel R.M. Morgan H.W. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to several hours for pyrolysin (6Eggen R. Geerling R.A. Watts J. de Vos W.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 71: 17-20Crossref Google Scholar). Aquifex pyrophilus is a microaerobic eubacterium that grows optimally at 85 °C. This organism is also regarded as the most ancient bacterium because of its autotrophic nature and its deep location in the phylogenetic tree (10Burggraf S. Olsen G.J. Stetter K.O. Woese C.R. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Several genes homologous to proteases have been identified from the genomic sequence ofAquifex aeolicus (11Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). In addition, sequence tags similar to protease-like genes such as the lon protease inEscherichia coli allowed the recognition of the signal peptidase and the serine-type protease from the sequence analysis of the genomic DNA of A. pyrophilus (12Choi I.G. Kim S.S. Ryu J.R. Han Y.S. Bang W.G. Kim S.H. Yu G.Y. Extremophiles. 1997; 1: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The role of the serine-type protease in A. pyrophilus may not be involved in the degradation of extracellular peptides because these compounds are not utilized as carbon or nitrogen sources. To characterize the serine-type protease of A. pyrophilus, we have cloned the entire gene and determined its DNA sequence. The cloned gene belongs to the subtilisin family and is localized in the cell wall fraction of A. pyrophilus as a mature form of 43 kDa. When the gene is transformed into E. coli, it is expressed as active and processed forms, although the expression level is low. This protein shows extreme stability at high temperatures and at a broad range of pH values. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from Promega. Sequencing primers were purchased from Bioneer (Seoul, Korea). A. pyrophilus was obtained from the German Collection of Microorganism and Cell Culture (Deutsch Sammlung von Mikroorganismen, Braunschweig, Germany) and was grown in a modified SME medium (13Stetter K.O. Konig H. Stackebrandt E. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1983; 4: 535-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) at 85 °C as described by Huber et al. (14Huber R. Wilharm T. Huber D. Tricone A. Burggraf S. Konig H. Rachel R. Rockinger I. Fricke H. Stetter K.O. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 340-351Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The cells were inoculated into 20 ml of liquid medium in a 120-ml bottle that was filled with 3 bars of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen at a ratio of 79.5:20:0.5 and grown for 12 h with moderate shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at −80 °C until further usage. The E. coli strain used for plasmid DNA amplification was DH5aH (supE44 ΔlacU169(φ80 lacZΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1). E. coli XL1-blue MRA P2 (Δ(mcrA)18 Δ(mcrCB-hsdSMR-mrr)173 endA1 supE44 thi-l relA1 gyrA96 lac P2 lysogen) was used for λ phage propagation, andE. coli BL21(DE3) (E. coli B F− dcm ompT hsdS(rB- mB-) gal λ(DE3)) was used for protein expression. A. pyrophilus genomic DNA was purified using a genomic DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For the construction of the genomic λ library, 20 μg of genomic DNA from A. pyrophilus was partially digested with HindIII and ligated with 5 μg of λ DASHII digested with HindIII. The ligated DNA was packaged using a packaging kit (Stratagene) and amplified in E. coli MRA (P2) in which only phages containing foreign DNA were propagated. About 4,000 primary plaques were obtained and further amplified. DNAs from λ clones was isolated using a Qiagen λ DNA extraction kit. Standard procedures were used for cloning and sequencing as described by Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Southern analysis was performed with an ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (UK). The determination of nucleotide sequence was carried out with an ABI 373 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The obtained DNA sequences were converted into amino acid sequences in all six possible reading frames and were compared with known proteins in the data base using a sequence comparison program, BLAST (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar). For multiple sequence alignment between functionally related proteins, the SEQSEE (17Wishart D.S. Boyko R.F. Willard L. Richards F.M. Sykes B.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar) and MACAW programs (18Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) were used. The putative membrane-spanning region was assigned using the TMpred program (19Hofman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166-170Google Scholar). Cell paste of A. pyrophilus was suspended in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 μg/ml lysozyme) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were sonicated for 2 min using a Branson Sonifier 450 (Branson Ultrasonic Co.). The crude extract was centrifuged for 20 min at 18,000 × g, and the pellet representing the cell wall fraction was recovered. The proteins in the cell wall fraction were extracted with 0.1% SDS at 95 °C for 20 min. The membrane fraction was prepared from the crude extract using serial centrifugation. The crude extract was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet representing the membrane fraction was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For the preparation of peripheral or integral membrane proteins, the membrane fraction was treated with 1.0 m NaCl or 0.5% Triton X-100 and was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Different regions of the open reading frame of the cloned protease gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with 5′ and 3′ primers harboring NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The amplified DNA fragment and the vector, pET21a (Novagen), were treated with NdeI andBamHI, ligated, and transformed into E. coliBL21(DE3) cells. The transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin with vigorous shaking to anA 600 nm of 0.7. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × gfor 10 min. For the preparation of an antibody specific to the cloned gene product, a fragment of the open reading frame representing amino acids 102–494 was expressed in E. coli using the pET system as described above. The expressed protein, recovered from inclusion bodies, was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ORF, open reading frame; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. The protein band was excised from the gel, crushed, and injected into a mouse for antibody production. Mouse serum was obtained 4 weeks after injection. For Western analysis, proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) in 100 mm CAPS buffer, pH 10.0. The membrane was treated with a 5% skim milk solution and then reacted with 1/2,000 diluted serum in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST buffer, protein bands that bound to the antibody were detected using a chemiluminescent reaction using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). Immunoprecipitation was carried out according to the method described by Kessler (20Kessler S.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 442-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The immune serum was added to 50 ml of the cell wall extract and incubated on ice for 1 h with occasional stirring. Then, 50 ml of Staphylococcus aureus formalin fixed cells (Sigma) were added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at 0 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and protease activity in the supernatant was further analyzed. E. coli cells that expressed the cloned gene were harvested at 4,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in lysis buffer without lysozyme (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The cells were disrupted by sonication for 2 min, and the soluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min. After removing heat-labile proteins in the crude extract by heat treatment for 20 min at 95 °C, the soluble fraction was loaded onto a 1.5 × 15-cm Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. A 200-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 m NaCl in equilibrating buffer was used to elute the protease. Either a colorimetric method or a gel-staining method was used to measure protease activity. For a colorimetric method, samples were reacted with 0.5% azocasein as described by Cowanet al. (5Cowan D.A. Smolenski K.A. Daniel R.M. Morgan H.W. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. The reaction mixture consisted of 100 μl of enzyme sample and 500 μl of 0.5% azocasein dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 9.0. After incubation at 85 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of 15% trichloroacetic acid, and the absorbance value at 440 nm was measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The gel staining assay was carried out using 0.1% gelatin-containing gel as described by Kleiner and Stetler-Stevenson (21Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Proteins were assayed by the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. One of the λ clones from the genomic DNA library ofA. pyrophilus hybridized to the sequence tag (Fig.1 A, AQpBB007) that contained a sequence similar to that found in serine-type proteases (12Choi I.G. Kim S.S. Ryu J.R. Han Y.S. Bang W.G. Kim S.H. Yu G.Y. Extremophiles. 1997; 1: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Southern analysis indicates that the sequence tag used as a probe is located in the middle of the cloned DNA. The sequence of the 2.1-kilobase region including the sequence tag region has been determined in both strands (Fig. 1 B). In the sequenced region, there is only one open reading frame (ORF) larger than 100 amino acids. This ORF contains the serine-type protease consensus sequence present in the sequence tag. The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the ORF are shown in Fig. 2. Upstream from the beginning of the ORF, consensus bacterial promoter sequences were found. The TATAAT and TTGAAG sequences at 24 and 52 bases upstream from the open reading frame are homologous to the −10 (TATAAT) and −35 (TTGACA) promoter sequences (23McClure M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Downstream of the putative promoter sites, there are four ATG codons (at the first, 50th, 102nd, and 121st codon) that are candidates for translation initiation sites of the gene. None of them has a distinct ribosome-binding sequence (AGGAGG) in the adjacent 5′-region, except the purine-rich sequence (AACAAG) located at the 8 bases upstream from the first ATG codon. In addition, the amino acid sequences translated between the first and fourth ATG codon are not conserved among proteases. However, the hydrophobic stretch of 20 amino acids starting right after the first ATG codon has a characteristic bacterial secretion signal. Because the gene product is mostly found in the cell wall fraction (see below), the first ATG codon may serve as a translation initiation site and the hydrophobic sequence may serve as a targeting signal. For these reasons, we have tentatively assigned the first methionine as the start site for translation. This ORF codes for a protein of 619 amino acids (69-kDa protein).Figure 2Nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the cloned protease gene of A. pyrophilus. The numbering is started from the ATG codon at the +1 position. The putative transcription sites are enclosed in a box. Amino acids inblack boxes represent the catalytic residues commonly found in a serine-type protease. The putative signal sequence isunderlined. The probe sequence is indicated as adotted line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The amino acid sequence of the cloned gene was compared with gene sequences deposited in data banks using the BLAST program. The genes that show strong sequence similarity to the cloned gene are serine-type proteases. It has three canonical residues of aspartic acid (Asp-140), histidine (His-184), and serine (Ser-502) that constitute the active site of serine-type proteases. Amino acid sequences around these residues are highly homologous to those of other proteases (Fig.3 A). The cloned gene has three regions of nonhomologous sequences at the NH2 and COOH terminus and between His-184 and Ser-502 (Fig. 3 B). The 150 amino acids at the NH2 terminus are assumed to be involved in membrane translocation because the presence of a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids and positive charges following them are well matched to those of a bacterial secretion signal sequence. The COOH-terminal nonhomologous region starts from amino acid 555. Interestingly, this region contains a putative transmembrane sequence (596–615) at the COOH-terminal end (Fig. 3 C). The sequence of 150 amino acids between His-184 and Ser-502 does not show any sequence similarity with any proteins in the data base. However, a serine-type protease from Bacillus subtilis, Vpr (24Sloma A. Rufo G.D. Theriault K.A. Dwyer M. Wilson S.W. Pero J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6889-6895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a cell envelope-localized serine protease from Lactobacillus lactis, Wg2 (25Vos P. Simons G. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13579-13585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also have a nonhomologous sequence between the active site residues, His and Ser. Although these sequences are not homologous, the size of this nonhomologous sequence and the arrangement in the gene are comparable. To confirm whether the cloned gene is expressed inA. pyrophilus, Western analysis was performed on the crude extract of A. pyrophilus with an antibody raised against a truncated protein of the cloned gene. A 43-kDa protein from the crude extract of A. pyrophilus was strongly detected by the antibody along with two faint bands migrating at 55 and 64 kDa. These bands are mainly observed in the cell wall fraction, and only small portions are detected in the cytosolic fraction (Fig.4 A). These results indicate that the cloned gene is expressed in A. pyrophilus as a precursor form, translocated to the cell wall, and processed to a mature form of 43 kDa. The 64- and 55-kDa bands are probably intermediate forms of the processing step. When the proteases in the extract of A. pyrophilus were observed by the gel staining assay, at least three positive proteases appeared in the cell wall fraction. Among them, the 43-kDa protease showed the highest proteolytic activity (Fig. 4 B). Treatment of the gel with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride abolished most of the protease activity of the 43-kDa protein, 2I.-G. Choi, W.-G. Bang, S.-H. Kim, and Y. G. Yu, unpublished results. indicating that the 43-kDa protease is a serine-type protease. To examine whether the 43-kDa protein observed in the Western analysis and in the gel-staining activity assay is the same protein, immunoprecipitation analysis was performed. The 43-kDa protease selectively cross-reacted with the antibody specific to the cloned gene product and was precipitated byS. aureus cells (Fig. 4 C). These results show that the 43-kDa protein encoded by the cloned gene is the major serine protease in the cell wall fraction. The cloned gene has a putative transmembrane sequence at the COOH terminus. To examine whether the gene product is a membrane protein, the membrane fraction was prepared from the cell extract of A. pyrophilus. Although the 43-kDa protein that cross-reacted with the antibody was mainly observed in the cell wall fraction, a significant amount of the protein was detected in the membrane fraction. To determine whether the protein is a peripheral or integral membrane protein, extracted protein treated with 1.0 m NaCl or 0.5% Triton X-100 was examined. Treatment with high salt did not wash out the protein from the membrane, and only a small fraction of protein was eluted from the membrane by detergent (Fig.5). Failure of extraction by detergent suggests that the 43-kDa protein is not a membrane protein. The protein observed in the membrane fraction may be because of contamination during cell fractionation. Attempts to purify the 43-kDa protease from A. pyrophilus were not successful because of low expression and difficulty in cell growth. When the gene was expressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) cell using a pET21a vector, the expression level was very low, and the host cells stopped growing and lysed. When the coding regions starting from the methionine at the 1st, 50th, or 102nd codon were expressed in E. coli, the proteins were expressed at low levels and showed a toxic effect on the host cells.2Expression of the coding region from the methionine at the 50th codon showed the lowest toxic effect, and the expressed protein was characterized. The expressed protein was not distinctively observed in Coomassie-stained PAGE (Fig. 6 A); however, it was observed as multiple bands whose sizes were in the range of 34–55 kDa by Western analysis (Fig. 6 B). The size of the expressed protein was reduced after heat treatment (Fig. 6 B). This result indicated that the cloned protease expressed in E. coli undergoes self-processing. To examine the properties of the cloned protease, the protein expressed in E. coli was partially purified by anion exchange chromatography and characterized. In addition, the thermostability and pH optimum of the native protease in the cell wall fraction of A. pyrophilus were also investigated. The activity of the native protease was highest at 85 °C and pH 7–9 (Fig. 7,A and B). When protease activity of the expressed protein in E. coli was investigated using azocasein as a substrate, it also showed a pattern similar to the native protease. The maximum activity was measured at 85–95 °C, and the activity gradually decreased as the temperature decreased (Fig.8 A). The optimum pH for the protease activity was obtained at pH 9 (Fig. 8 B). At the same pH, the protease seemed slightly more active in phosphate buffer than in Tris-HCl buffer. The stability of the expressed protein was examined by measuring the decrease in activity after incubation at high temperature. When the protein was incubated at 85 °C, it was slowly inactivated, and its half-life was calculated to be 90 h (Fig.9 A). At 105 °C, the activity of the protease decreased by 50% after incubation for 6 h (Fig. 9 B). These results indicate that the expressed protein is one of the highest thermostable proteases.Figure 8Characteristics of the protease expressed inE. coli. The partially purified protease was assayed for its protease activity using azocasein as a substrate at different pH values at 85 °C (A) or different incubation temperatures at pH 8.0 (B) for 30 min. Sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm) was used at pH 6–7 (•), 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7–9 (▪), and 100 mmCAPS buffer at pH 9–11 (▴).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Thermostability of the expressed protease.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Although a canonical ribosome-binding sequence that has been found in a manganese-superoxide dismutase gene of A. pyrophilus (27Lim J.H. Yu Y.G. Choi I.G. Ryu J.R. Ahn B.Y. Kim S.H. Han Y.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) has not been found in the cloned gene, the first methionine codon of the open reading frame was proposed as the initiation site of translation because it was located downstream of the putative promoter sequences. The size of the native protein was smaller than the calculated size based on the deduced amino acid sequence, indicating that the gene was translated as a precursor protein and processed to a mature form. Many subtilisin family proteases are translated as the prepro-form containing a secretion signal sequence. The signal sequence (presequence) was processed after translocation through the periplasmic membrane, and the following sequence (prosequence) was further processed to become the mature form (28Ikemura H. Takagi H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7859-7864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, the prosequences were located at both the NH2 and COOH termini of the protein and were cleaved during the maturation process (29Terada I. Kwon S.-T. Miyata Y. Matsuzawa H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6576-6581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 21 hydrophobic amino acids at the NH2 terminus of the open reading frame have characteristics found in signal sequences (30Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar). Besides the signal sequence, portions of the NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences should be processed. The distance between the conserved sequences containing aspartate (Asp-140) and serine (Ser-502) is about 385 residues, whose calculated size is slightly smaller than the size of the mature form. Hence, the 110–130 residues at the NH2terminus and the 80–100 residues at the COOH terminus of the precursor form should be processed to generate a 43-kDa protein. It is interesting that a putative membrane spanning sequence is present at the presumed COOH terminus prosequence (Fig. 3 C). A transmembrane sequence at the COOH terminus of a protease that anchors the protein to the membrane has been found in the Wg2 protease fromL. lactis (25Vos P. Simons G. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13579-13585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobic sequence at the COOH terminus may serve as a membrane anchor. In that case, the protein may be attached to the membrane transiently because most of the gene product was present as a processed form in the cell wall fraction. The function of the cloned protease in the cell is unclear. The protease may not be used for degradation of exogenous nutritional peptides, because A. pyrophilus is a strict autotroph. The physiological role of this protein may be related to its cellular localization. A. pyrophilus contains a very stable proteinaceous layer, called the S-layer, that is present outside of the outer membrane (14Huber R. Wilharm T. Huber D. Tricone A. Burggraf S. Konig H. Rachel R. Rockinger I. Fricke H. Stetter K.O. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 340-351Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The S-layer of hyperthermophiles consists of heat-stable proteins, and it is assumed to protect the cell from extreme environments such as high temperature (31Peters J. Nitsch M. Kuhlmorgen B. Golbik R. Lupas A. Kellermann J. Engelhardt H. Pfander J.-P. Muller S. Goldie K. Engel A. Stetter K.-O. Baumeister W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 385-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis has shown that a very stable protease has been attached to the middle of the long stem that forms the S-layer (7Mayr J. Lupas A. Kellermann J. Eckerskorn C. Baumeister W. Peters J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We presume that the cloned protease is associated with the S-layer proteins of A. pyrophilus, because the protein is tightly associated to the cell wall where the S-layer is present. However, whether the protease is involved in the protein degradation process or serves as a building block of the S-layer structure is currently unknown. The cloned protease is extremely stable to heat. The half-life of the expressed protein at 105 °C (6 h) suggests that this enzyme is one of the most heat-stable proteases. Structural analysis has shown that one of the major factors that stabilizes proteins from hyperthermophiles is ionic bonds or salt bridges between charged amino acids (32Yip K.S.P. Stillman T.L. Britton K.L. Artymiuk P.J. Baker P.J. Sedelnikova S.E. Engel P.C. Pasquo A. Chiaraluce R. Conslavi V. Scandurra R. Rice D.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 1147-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In addition, proteins from hyperthermophiles have more charged amino acids than proteins from mesophiles or thermophiles. A higher occurrence of charged amino acids is also observed in the proteins from A. pyrophilus (12Choi I.G. Kim S.S. Ryu J.R. Han Y.S. Bang W.G. Kim S.H. Yu G.Y. Extremophiles. 1997; 1: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The percentage of aspartate, glutamate, arginine, and lysine of the cloned protease is about 20%. This is similar to the value found in pyrolysin from Pyrococcus furiosus and is much higher than proteases from mesophiles or thermophiles (TableI). These charged residues may be engaged in the formation of salt bridges.Table IComparison of amino acid composition of Aquifex protease with those of several serine proteasesAmino acidsApproteasePyrolysinaHyperthermophile.Aqualysin IbThermophile.ThermitasebThermophile.Subtilisin BPNcMesophile.No. of residues%No. of residues%No. of residues%No. of residues%No. of residues%Ala304.8835.96412.54415.85213.6Arg223.6292.1275.351.830.8Asn376.0795.7214.1217.5205.2Asp315.0785.6224.3134.7143.7Cys91.500.071.410.400.0Gln121.9221.6163.1124.3143.7Glu396.31107.9132.520.7112.9Gly497.91148.26212.13311.84010.5His111.8191.461.241.482.1Ile569.01107.9142.7145.0174.5Leu6610.71077.7397.693.2215.5Lys345.5654.781.6103.6287.3Met71.1231.771.410.492.4Phe294.7483.4122.331.182.1Pro264.2775.5275.3124.3153.9Ser548.7805.7489.42910.44712.3Thr365.81107.9428.2227.9184.7Trp61.0211.5122.362.241.0Tyr254.0846.0295.7155.4143.7Val406.51399.9377.2238.23910.2Total619100.01398100.0513100.0279100.0382100.0Pyrolysin was from P. furiosus (NCBI accession no. 1556463), aqualysin I was from T. aquaticus (NCBI accession no. 94701), thermiatase was from T. vulgaris (NCBI accession no. 494645), and subtilisin BPN was from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (NCBI accession no. 67620).a Hyperthermophile.b Thermophile.c Mesophile.

Another factor that contributes to the stability of the protease is disulfide bonds. There are a total of nine cysteine residues in the precursor form of the cloned protein and eight residues in the predicted mature form. Most of these cysteine residues form disulfide bonds that stabilize the protein because treatment with 1 mm dithiothreitol reduced the heat resistance of the protein at 85 °C to less than 2 h.2 Hence, disulfide bonds contribute to the extremely high stability of the protein. Among 170 subtilisin family proteases, only a few, such as aqualysin I, have cysteine residues that may form disulfide bonds (33Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Also, serine-type proteases from hyperthermophiles discovered so far do not have cysteine residues except aerolysin and STABLE (7Mayr J. Lupas A. Kellermann J. Eckerskorn C. Baumeister W. Peters J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Enhancement of thermal stability by introduction of intramolecular disulfide bonds has been reported in phage T4 lysozyme (34Matsumura M. Singer G. Matthews B.M. Nature. 1989; 342: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) or subtilisin (35Takagi H. Takahashi T. Momose H. Inouye M. Maeda Y. Matsuzawa H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6874-6878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, stabilization of the protein by disulfide bonds is an unusual case among the serine-type proteases from hyperthermophiles. The identity of the disulfide bonds that contribute to the stability of the cloned protease is of current interest."

This renders it incapable of transducing a signal in response to ligand binding. However, in conjunction with ErbB2, ErbB3 is a potent mediator of signaling by the growth factor heregulin. Heregulin binding to ErbB3 induces formation of a heterodimeric complex with ErbB2, and this results in transactivation of the ErbB2 kinase. Although interaction between the extracellular domains of these receptors is an essential part of this process, it was not clear whether interaction between the cytoplasmic domains is also necessary for transactivation. By examining the abilities of a series of cytoplasmic domain mutants of ErbB3 to activate ErbB2, we have found a discrete sequence of three amino acid residues (LVI), located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the impaired ErbB3 kinase region, that is obligatory for transactivation. We conclude that formation of a functional ErbB2-ErbB3 signaling complex requires the presence of a specific structural feature within the ErbB3 cytoplasmic domain and suggest that ErbB2 transactivation results from a physical interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors.

Receptor tyrosine kinases play a pivotal role in the transduction of extracellular signals into the cells. The binding of cognate growth factors to these cell-surface receptors results in receptor oligomerization and activation of the intrinsic kinase activity (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This leads to receptor phosphorylation and triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling events that ultimately elicit a variety of cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, or migration.An extensively characterized subgroup of this receptor superfamily is the ErbB group of receptors, also known as the class I receptor tyrosine kinases. Members of this group include the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HRG, heregulin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HRG, heregulin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. or ErbB1), ErbB2 (also termed HER2 or Neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). EGFR binds several distinct ligands including EGF and transforming growth factor-α (3Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).

A ligand that directly binds to ErbB2 has not been identified. Nevertheless, ErbB2 plays an important role in signaling.

At least 10 different homo- and heteromeric combinations of ErbB proteins have been reported (10Riese D.J.I. van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D. Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell.

The interreceptor interactions are hierarchically organized, where ErbB2 is the preferred heteromeric partner, and it favors interaction with ErbB3 (12Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G.

Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar) may account for the lack of catalytic activity. ErbB2, however, is characterized by a constitutively active kinase (17Lonardo F.

The physiological significance of this heteromeric complex is emphasized by the fact that the presence of ErbB2 in ErbB3-expressing cells significantly enhances the transformation ability (18Alimandi M.

Additionally, active ErbB2-ErbB3 receptor complexes have been seen in several mammary tumor cell lines, indicating the relevance of this heteromeric receptor aggregate in human neoplasia (18Alimandi M.

Recruitment of ErbB2 into the HRG-ErbB3 complex leads to the formation of a high affinity HRG-binding receptor, which is capable of generating a tyrosine phosphorylation signal due to the kinase activity of ErbB2 (7Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III., K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the isolated extracellular domain of ErbB3 show that ligand binding is exclusively mediated by the extracellular region of ErbB3 (22Horan T. Wen J. Arakawa T. Liu N. Brankow D. Hu S. Ratzkin B. Philo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24604-24608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interaction between ErbB2 and ErbB3 upon HRG stimulation is seen with a modified version of the extracellular domain of ErbB3 containing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety anchoring it to the plasma membrane (23Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J.D. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 6: 4938-4950Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Also, receptor IgGs consisting of the extracellular domains of ErbB3 and ErbB2 fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain show increased HRG binding affinity compared with ErbB3 binding alone (24Fitzpatrick V.D. Pisacane P.I. Vandlen R.L. Sliwkowski M.X. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that HRG binding and the affinity shift for HRG binding in the presence of ErbB2 require only the extracellular domains of these receptors.Details of the molecular mechanism that leads to the activation of ErbB2 kinase are unknown, and in particular, the role of the intracellular domain of ErbB3 is uncertain. We questioned whether structural elements in the intracellular domain of ErbB3 were needed for the transactivation of ErbB2. In this study, we designed a series of C-terminal deletion and substitution mutants of ErbB3 and assessed the phosphorylation status of the receptors in the complex. We report here that a distinct three-amino acid segment (LVI) in the intracellular domain of ErbB3 is required for transactivation of ErbB2 and propose that this is an intermediate step between ligand-induced receptor dimerization and kinase activation.DISCUSSIONThe allosteric oligomerization model proposed for EGFR by Schlessinger (33Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3119-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 34Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) predicts that ligand binding induces formation of receptor dimers, which brings the intracellular domains into close proximity, and causes them to phosphorylate one another intrans. Because ErbB3 lacks intrinsic kinase activity and ErbB2 does not bind HRG, this model does not fully explain the phosphorylation pattern observed in the ErbB2-ErbB3 complex following HRG stimulation. It was also previously unclear whether activation of the intrinsic kinase required specific cytoplasmic domain interactions. Here, we present data showing that transactivation of the ErbB2 kinase by ErbB3 requires the presence of a structural element within the ErbB3 cytoplasmic domain. Using ErbB3 deletion and substitution mutants, we found a discrete sequence of three amino acids (LVI) at the carboxyl terminus of the inactive kinase domain of ErbB3 that is necessary for ErbB2 transactivation. Deletion of segments distal to this region had no effect, indicating that they are not required for this activity. At present, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional sequences N-terminal to this region may also contribute to the transactivation of ErbB2.The results of our study suggest at least two models whereby direct sequence-specific molecular interactions may result in receptor transactivation. These models extend the Schlessinger hypothesis (33Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3119-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,34Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) to the ErbB2-ErbB3 system and are shown schematically in Fig.8. In the first model, activation of ErbB2 results from a direct interaction between the intracellular domains of the two receptors. In this model, HRG binding to ErbB3 results in a conformational change in the extracellular domain of ErbB3 facilitating recruitment of ErbB2 and formation of the heterodimeric complex. The interaction between the extracellular domains of the receptors aligns their intracellular domains, bringing the LVI motif of ErbB3 into direct contact with an as yet undefined region of ErbB2. This, in turn, leads to the activation of the ErbB2 kinase. An alternative model assumes the participation of a third protein. Ligand-induced heterodimerization of ErbB3 with ErbB2 allows an adaptor molecule with specific recognition sites for each receptor to bridge their intracellular domains. The putative adaptor protein binds to the LVI sequence in ErbB3 and to an unknown sequence in ErbB2. We postulate that the adaptor stabilizes interactions between adjacent cytoplasmic domains that lead to the activation of the ErbB2 kinase, resulting in transphosphorylation of the receptors.Sequence alignment of the tyrosine kinase domains of members of the ErbB receptor family revealed that the LVI segment is conserved in EGFR as well as ErbB3 and ErbB4 (Fig. 5). Interestingly, in ErbB2, the motif is conservatively changed, having leucine replaced by valine. The conservation of LVI in the ErbB receptors suggests that the transactivation mechanism seen in the ErbB2-ErbB3 and ErbB2-ErbB4 dimers is not restricted to these combinations, but may be a widespread mechanism of transactivation in ErbB2-containing complexes. Consistent with a more general mechanism are data from down-regulation studies of ErbB2-EGFR heterodimers (35Worthylake R. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8594-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ErbB2 down-regulation is correlated with the transactivation of ErbB2 upon EGF binding and occurs only if sequences between amino acids 899 and 958, containing the LVI motif, are present in a kinase-defective EGFR mutant. It is noteworthy that the LVI sequence in EGFR has been identified as part of the lysosomal targeting sequence (YLVI) that contributes to the down-regulation of EGFR (36Opresko L.K. Chang C.-P. Will B.H. Burke P.M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4325-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This segment has also been mapped as part of the binding site of a newly isolated sorting nexin protein (37Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).Uncontrolled signaling from ErbB family members is observed in various cancers (38Prigent S.A. Lemoine N.R. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 1-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Overexpression of EGFR or ErbB2 occurs with high frequency and often correlates with poor patient survival (39Modjtahedi H. Dean C. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 4: 277-296PubMed Google Scholar, 40Slamon D.J.

Therefore, blocking the ErbB signaling pathway may be an ideal target for an antiproliferative agent. To date, several approaches have been undertaken to intercept the signal generation (42Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). For example, antibodies that directly bind to the extracellular domain of ErbB2 or EGFR have been very efficient as antiproliferative reagents (43Baselga J. Mendelsohn J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 127-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 44Baselga J. Tripathy D. Mendelsohn J. Baughman S. Benz C.C. Dantis L. Sklarin N.T. Seidman A.D. Hudis C.A. Moore J. Rosen P.P.

Treat. 1994; 29: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The selective inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase with various small molecules also results in antitumor activity (46Klohs W.D. Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1997; 9: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The identification of the transactivation sequence in ErbB3 suggests another way to block signaling in a heteromeric complex. A compound that directly interacts with the LVI segment in ErbB3 could inhibit specific transactivation, receptor phosphorylation, and consequently all downstream signaling pathways. Receptor tyrosine kinases play a pivotal role in the transduction of extracellular signals into the cells. The binding of cognate growth factors to these cell-surface receptors results in receptor oligomerization and activation of the intrinsic kinase activity (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This leads to receptor phosphorylation and triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling events that ultimately elicit a variety of cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, or migration. An extensively characterized subgroup of this receptor superfamily is the ErbB group of receptors, also known as the class I receptor tyrosine kinases. Members of this group include the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HRG, heregulin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HRG, heregulin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. or ErbB1), ErbB2 (also termed HER2 or Neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). EGFR binds several distinct ligands including EGF and transforming growth factor-α (3Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). ErbB3 and ErbB4 bind isoforms of the heregulin family (also designated neuregulin or Neu differentiation factor) (4Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A.

A ligand that directly binds to ErbB2 has not been identified. Nevertheless, ErbB2 plays an important role in signaling. ErbB2 is transactivated by heterodimerization with ligand-occupied EGFR, ErbB3, or ErbB4 (6Wada T. Myers J.N. Kokai Y. Brown V.I. Hamuro J. LeVea C.M. Greene M.I.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The extensive interreceptor associations that occur in the ErbB family serve to increase the repertoire of cellular responses to growth factor stimulation and to fine-tune growth factor signaling. At least 10 different homo- and heteromeric combinations of ErbB proteins have been reported (10Riese D.J.I. van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D. Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 11Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). However, these combinations are not equally favorable. The interreceptor interactions are hierarchically organized, where ErbB2 is the preferred heteromeric partner, and it favors interaction with ErbB3 (12Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between ErbB2 and ErbB3 is especially important as the kinase of ErbB3 is dysfunctional. The impaired kinase activity has been demonstrated in several systems. It was initially reported in insect cells expressing ErbB3 (14Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III., K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alterations of four amino acid residues in the kinase region that are otherwise conserved among all protein tyrosine kinases (16Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar) may account for the lack of catalytic activity. ErbB2, however, is characterized by a constitutively active kinase (17Lonardo F.

The physiological significance of this heteromeric complex is emphasized by the fact that the presence of ErbB2 in ErbB3-expressing cells significantly enhances the transformation ability (18Alimandi M.

Additionally, active ErbB2-ErbB3 receptor complexes have been seen in several mammary tumor cell lines, indicating the relevance of this heteromeric receptor aggregate in human neoplasia (18Alimandi M.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). HRG binds with low affinity to kinase-inactive ErbB3. Recruitment of ErbB2 into the HRG-ErbB3 complex leads to the formation of a high affinity HRG-binding receptor, which is capable of generating a tyrosine phosphorylation signal due to the kinase activity of ErbB2 (7Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III., K.L. J. Biol.

Studies on the isolated extracellular domain of ErbB3 show that ligand binding is exclusively mediated by the extracellular region of ErbB3 (22Horan T. Wen J. Arakawa T. Liu N. Brankow D. Hu S.

Furthermore, the interaction between ErbB2 and ErbB3 upon HRG stimulation is seen with a modified version of the extracellular domain of ErbB3 containing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety anchoring it to the plasma membrane (23Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J.D. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 6: 4938-4950Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Also, receptor IgGs consisting of the extracellular domains of ErbB3 and ErbB2 fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain show increased HRG binding affinity compared with ErbB3 binding alone (24Fitzpatrick V.D. Pisacane P.I. Vandlen R.L. Sliwkowski M.X. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that HRG binding and the affinity shift for HRG binding in the presence of ErbB2 require only the extracellular domains of these receptors. Details of the molecular mechanism that leads to the activation of ErbB2 kinase are unknown, and in particular, the role of the intracellular domain of ErbB3 is uncertain. We questioned whether structural elements in the intracellular domain of ErbB3 were needed for the transactivation of ErbB2. In this study, we designed a series of C-terminal deletion and substitution mutants of ErbB3 and assessed the phosphorylation status of the receptors in the complex. We report here that a distinct three-amino acid segment (LVI) in the intracellular domain of ErbB3 is required for transactivation of ErbB2 and propose that this is an intermediate step between ligand-induced receptor dimerization and kinase activation. DISCUSSIONThe allosteric oligomerization model proposed for EGFR by Schlessinger (33Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3119-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 34Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) predicts that ligand binding induces formation of receptor dimers, which brings the intracellular domains into close proximity, and causes them to phosphorylate one another intrans. Because ErbB3 lacks intrinsic kinase activity and ErbB2 does not bind HRG, this model does not fully explain the phosphorylation pattern observed in the ErbB2-ErbB3 complex following HRG stimulation. It was also previously unclear whether activation of the intrinsic kinase required specific cytoplasmic domain interactions. Here, we present data showing that transactivation of the ErbB2 kinase by ErbB3 requires the presence of a structural element within the ErbB3 cytoplasmic domain. Using ErbB3 deletion and substitution mutants, we found a discrete sequence of three amino acids (LVI) at the carboxyl terminus of the inactive kinase domain of ErbB3 that is necessary for ErbB2 transactivation. Deletion of segments distal to this region had no effect, indicating that they are not required for this activity. At present, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional sequences N-terminal to this region may also contribute to the transactivation of ErbB2.The results of our study suggest at least two models whereby direct sequence-specific molecular interactions may result in receptor transactivation. These models extend the Schlessinger hypothesis (33Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3119-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,34Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) to the ErbB2-ErbB3 system and are shown schematically in Fig.8. In the first model, activation of ErbB2 results from a direct interaction between the intracellular domains of the two receptors. In this model, HRG binding to ErbB3 results in a conformational change in the extracellular domain of ErbB3 facilitating recruitment of ErbB2 and formation of the heterodimeric complex. The interaction between the extracellular domains of the receptors aligns their intracellular domains, bringing the LVI motif of ErbB3 into direct contact with an as yet undefined region of ErbB2. This, in turn, leads to the activation of the ErbB2 kinase. An alternative model assumes the participation of a third protein. Ligand-induced heterodimerization of ErbB3 with ErbB2 allows an adaptor molecule with specific recognition sites for each receptor to bridge their intracellular domains. The putative adaptor protein binds to the LVI sequence in ErbB3 and to an unknown sequence in ErbB2. We postulate that the adaptor stabilizes interactions between adjacent cytoplasmic domains that lead to the activation of the ErbB2 kinase, resulting in transphosphorylation of the receptors.Sequence alignment of the tyrosine kinase domains of members of the ErbB receptor family revealed that the LVI segment is conserved in EGFR as well as ErbB3 and ErbB4 (Fig. 5). Interestingly, in ErbB2, the motif is conservatively changed, having leucine replaced by valine. The conservation of LVI in the ErbB receptors suggests that the transactivation mechanism seen in the ErbB2-ErbB3 and ErbB2-ErbB4 dimers is not restricted to these combinations, but may be a widespread mechanism of transactivation in ErbB2-containing complexes. Consistent with a more general mechanism are data from down-regulation studies of ErbB2-EGFR heterodimers (35Worthylake R. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8594-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ErbB2 down-regulation is correlated with the transactivation of ErbB2 upon EGF binding and occurs only if sequences between amino acids 899 and 958, containing the LVI motif, are present in a kinase-defective EGFR mutant. It is noteworthy that the LVI sequence in EGFR has been identified as part of the lysosomal targeting sequence (YLVI) that contributes to the down-regulation of EGFR (36Opresko L.K. Chang C.-P.

This segment has also been mapped as part of the binding site of a newly isolated sorting nexin protein (37Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N.

Ther. 1994; 64: 127-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 44Baselga J. Tripathy D. Mendelsohn J. Baughman S. Benz C.C. Dantis L. Sklarin N.T. Seidman A.D. Hudis C.A. Moore J. Rosen P.P.

Treat. 1994; 29: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The selective inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase with various small molecules also results in antitumor activity (46Klohs W.D. Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1997; 9: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The identification of the transactivation sequence in ErbB3 suggests another way to block signaling in a heteromeric complex. A compound that directly interacts with the LVI segment in ErbB3 could inhibit specific transactivation, receptor phosphorylation, and consequently all downstream signaling pathways. The allosteric oligomerization model proposed for EGFR by Schlessinger (33Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3119-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 34Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) predicts that ligand binding induces formation of receptor dimers, which brings the intracellular domains into close proximity, and causes them to phosphorylate one another intrans. Because ErbB3 lacks intrinsic kinase activity and ErbB2 does not bind HRG, this model does not fully explain the phosphorylation pattern observed in the ErbB2-ErbB3 complex following HRG stimulation. It was also previously unclear whether activation of the intrinsic kinase required specific cytoplasmic domain interactions. Here, we present data showing that transactivation of the ErbB2 kinase by ErbB3 requires the presence of a structural element within the ErbB3 cytoplasmic domain. Using ErbB3 deletion and substitution mutants, we found a discrete sequence of three amino acids (LVI) at the carboxyl terminus of the inactive kinase domain of ErbB3 that is necessary for ErbB2 transactivation. Deletion of segments distal to this region had no effect, indicating that they are not required for this activity. At present, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional sequences N-terminal to this region may also contribute to the transactivation of ErbB2. The results of our study suggest at least two models whereby direct sequence-specific molecular interactions may result in receptor transactivation. These models extend the Schlessinger hypothesis (33Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3119-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,34Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) to the ErbB2-ErbB3 system and are shown schematically in Fig.8. In the first model, activation of ErbB2 results from a direct interaction between the intracellular domains of the two receptors. In this model, HRG binding to ErbB3 results in a conformational change in the extracellular domain of ErbB3 facilitating recruitment of ErbB2 and formation of the heterodimeric complex. The interaction between the extracellular domains of the receptors aligns their intracellular domains, bringing the LVI motif of ErbB3 into direct contact with an as yet undefined region of ErbB2. This, in turn, leads to the activation of the ErbB2 kinase. An alternative model assumes the participation of a third protein. Ligand-induced heterodimerization of ErbB3 with ErbB2 allows an adaptor molecule with specific recognition sites for each receptor to bridge their intracellular domains. The putative adaptor protein binds to the LVI sequence in ErbB3 and to an unknown sequence in ErbB2. We postulate that the adaptor stabilizes interactions between adjacent cytoplasmic domains that lead to the activation of the ErbB2 kinase, resulting in transphosphorylation of the receptors. Sequence alignment of the tyrosine kinase domains of members of the ErbB receptor family revealed that the LVI segment is conserved in EGFR as well as ErbB3 and ErbB4 (Fig. 5). Interestingly, in ErbB2, the motif is conservatively changed, having leucine replaced by valine. The conservation of LVI in the ErbB receptors suggests that the transactivation mechanism seen in the ErbB2-ErbB3 and ErbB2-ErbB4 dimers is not restricted to these combinations, but may be a widespread mechanism of transactivation in ErbB2-containing complexes. Consistent with a more general mechanism are data from down-regulation studies of ErbB2-EGFR heterodimers (35Worthylake R. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8594-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ErbB2 down-regulation is correlated with the transactivation of ErbB2 upon EGF binding and occurs only if sequences between amino acids 899 and 958, containing the LVI motif, are present in a kinase-defective EGFR mutant. It is noteworthy that the LVI sequence in EGFR has been identified as part of the lysosomal targeting sequence (YLVI) that contributes to the down-regulation of EGFR (36Opresko L.K. Chang C.-P. Will B.H. Burke P.M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4325-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This segment has also been mapped as part of the binding site of a newly isolated sorting nexin protein (37Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Uncontrolled signaling from ErbB family members is observed in various cancers (38Prigent S.A. Lemoine N.R. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 1-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Overexpression of EGFR or ErbB2 occurs with high frequency and often correlates with poor patient survival (39Modjtahedi H. Dean C. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 4: 277-296PubMed Google Scholar, 40Slamon D.J.

Therefore, blocking the ErbB signaling pathway may be an ideal target for an antiproliferative agent. To date, several approaches have been undertaken to intercept the signal generation (42Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar).

Aberrant expression of these ErbB proteins is frequently observed in human malignancies (10O'Rourke D.M. Zhang X. Greene M.I. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1997; 109: 209-219PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane mutation in rat p185neu (also termed Tneu) (12Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) serves as a paradigm for receptor dimerization that leads to constitutive kinase activation contributing to oncogenic transformation (11Bargmann C.I.

Additional support for this mechanism has come from the identification of a naturally occurring activated EGFR oncoprotein (ΔEGFR or EGFRvIII) in human tumors, which forms constitutive dimers and confers increased tumorigenicity (14Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 15O'Rourke D.M. Nute E.J.L. Davis J.G. Wu C. Lee A. Murali R. Zhang H.-T. Qian X.

Gene amplification and overexpression of ErbB-2 have been observed in a high frequency of human adenocarcinomas, including those of the breast and ovary, and these features correlate with poor clinical prognosis (16Slamon D.J.

Biochemical and biophysical analysis of baculovirus-expressed p185neu proteins further support the notion of receptor oligomerization as a mechanism of kinase activation of normal holoreceptors (20LeVea C.M. Myers J.N. Dougall W.C. Qian X. Greene M.I. Receptor. 1993; 3: 293-309PubMed Google Scholar, 21Samanta A. LeVea C.M. Dougall W.C. Qian X. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Heterodimeric interactions govern many signaling properties within the ErbB receptor family. Co-expression of EGFR and p185c-neu at modestly elevated levels (105/cell) (but not either receptor independently) results in synergistic transformation (22Kokai Y. Myers J.N. Wada T. Brown V.I. LeVea C.M. Davis J.G. Dobashi K. Greene M.I.

A. 1992; 89: 1330-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization of EGFR and ErbB-2 has also been observed in human breast tumor lines (25Goldman R. Benlevy R. Peles E. Yarden Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11024-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Moreover, ligand treatment promotes the assembly of an activated p185c-neu·EGFR kinase complex in many cells (24Qian X.L. Decker S.J. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1330-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), resulting in novel distinct cellular signaling events (26Dougall W.C. Qian X. Miller M.J. Greene M.I. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, the receptor tyrosine kinase ensemble can be activated not only by homodimer formation, but also by heterodimeric associations. In this regard, endodomain interactions between p185neu and EGFR appear to influence functional signaling outcomes (27Qian X. Dougll W.C. Fei Z. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). In response to EGF or Neu differentiating factor/heregulin (a ligand for ErbB-3 and ErbB-4) family ligands (28Peles E. Yarden Y.

More recent data support the notion that p185neu·ErbB-2 is the preferred heterodimerization partner of all ErbB receptors and a mediator for divergent cellular signaling in many distinct cell types (34Tzahar E.

The structural basis for ErbB receptor heterodimerization has not been completely defined and crystallographic information on dimerized ErbB receptor kinases is currently unavailable. Previous work has revealed that ectodomain interactions are sufficient to stabilize dimer formation between p185neu and EGFR in fibroblasts and transformed cells (5Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.

Although the transmembrane alone can stabilize the formation of p185neu homodimers, the relative contributions of the transmembrane region and the ectodomain have not been directly compared regarding the formation of signaling heterodimers. In this study, we have constructed various p185neu deletion mutants in order to specifically compare signaling events resulting from associations between EGF receptors and either p185neuectodomain- or endodomain-derived mutant receptors. We have co-expressed EGFR with low levels of p185neu proteins, or their mutant derivatives, to monitor p185neu-mediated enhancement of cell growth and transformation in vitro and in vivo, and to analyze the influence of EGF-induced heterodimeric receptor interactions on downstream signaling effectors. Signaling resulting from heterodimeric associations between full-length EGFR and mutant p185neu proteins has revealed the functional importance of p185neu subdomains in the induction of Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathways contributing to cell growth and transformation.

These wild-type or mutant p185neu cDNAs were also subcloned into pcDNA3 vector for transient expression in COS7 cells. pSRαEGFR/hygr vector (44Qian X. LeVea C.M. Freeman J.K. Dougall W.C. Greene M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1500-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was used for full-length EGFR expression. Ten micrograms of the p185neu constructs were transfected into NR6 cells, a mouse fibroblast cell line devoid of endogenous EGF receptors (43Pruss R.M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3918-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), or NE91 cells expressing human EGFR (37Qian X. Dougall W.C. Hellman M.E. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1507-1514PubMed Google Scholar) by calcium phosphate precipitation. After 2–3 weeks of selection with Geneticin (0.9 mg/ml), the established stable clones were screened and characterized. Gene amplification by methotrexate was used to increase the p185neu receptor level. Expression of p185neu and its derivatives in resultant subclones was examined by flow cytometric analysis following anti-p185neu mAb 7.16.4 staining. Surface expression of p185neu proteins was then estimated by comparing the mean channel fluorescent intensity with that of B104-1-1 cells, as the level of p185neu in B104-1-1 cells was previously determined by 125I-labeled anti-neu mAb binding assay (22Kokai Y. Myers J.N. Wada T. Brown V.I. LeVea C.M. Davis J.G. Dobashi K. Greene M.I. Cell. 1989; 58: 287-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). EGFR numbers in NE91 cells and mutant p185neu co-transfected cells were determined by Scatchard assays as described (37Qian X. Dougall W.C. Hellman M.E. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1507-1514PubMed Google Scholar). These transfected clones were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Subconfluent cells in 10-cm dishes were washed and starved in cysteine-free DMEM for 1 h, and grown in low cysteine-containing 5% FBS-DMEM containing 55 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 16 h for metabolic labeling. Alternatively, the unlabeled cells were cultured overnight in 10-cm Petri dishes. After treatment with or without EGF, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with PBS containing 2 mmmembrane-impermeable cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3, Pierce), for 30 min. After quenching the cross-linking reaction with a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.9% NaCl, and 0.1 m glycine, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and solubilized with PI/RIPA buffer as described (24Qian X.L. Decker S.J. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1330-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes were washed and solubilized, then separated by gradient SDS-PAGE gels (4–7.5%). Proteins from metabolically labeled cells were analyzed by autoradiography. Proteins from unlabeled cells were transferred onto nitrocellulose and then immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20, anti-EGFR CT, or anti-p185 antiserum as indicated in the figures. The protein signals were identified by the binding of 125I-labeled protein A (NEN Life Science Products), or by enhanced chemiluminase (ECL) using ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cells (1 × 105) were plated in a six-well dish with DMEM containing 5% FBS overnight. Cells were then treated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 0–4 h and were harvested and washed with cold PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide. Cell preparations were then incubated with a saturating amount (0.5 μg/reaction) of anti-neu mAb 7.16.4 or anti-EGFR mAb 225, or an irrelevant mAB (such as 9BG5 against the hemagglutinin of reovirus receptor), at 4 °C for 30 min, restained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for another 30 min after extensive washing. Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson), as described previously (37Qian X. Dougall W.C. Hellman M.E. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1507-1514PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after subtracting the nonspecific background staining with 9BG5, the mean channel values from each time point were used to determine the percentage of surface expression of EGFR or p185neu proteins at the various time points after EGF treatment. Anchorage-independent growth ability was determined by assessing the colony forming efficiency of cells suspended in soft agar (15O'Rourke D.M. Nute E.J.L. Davis J.G. Wu C. Lee A. Murali R. Zhang H.-T. Qian X. Kao C.-C. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Qian X. Dougall W.C. Hellman M.E. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1507-1514PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (1000/dish) were suspended in 7% FBS-DMEM containing 0.18% agarose, and plated on 0.25% basal agar in each dish. Cells were fed with DMEM supplemented with 7% FBS-DMEM, 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.5). Colonies (>0.3 mm) were visualized at day 21 for all cell lines after stained with p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (1 mg/ml). Each cell line was examined in triplicate samples for separate experiments. To analyze the tumor growth in athymic mice, cells (1 × 106) of each line were suspended in 0.1 ml of PBS and injected intradermally in the mid-dorsum of NCR nude mice. PBS alone was also injected as a control. Animals used in this study were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the Committee on Animals of the University of Pennsylvania and those prepared by the Committee on Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resource. Tumor growth was monitored twice a week up to 10 weeks. Tumor size was calculated by this formula: 3.14/6 × (length × width × thickness) as described (27Qian X. Dougll W.C. Fei Z. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). The 3,(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay for measuring cell growth has been described previously (38Drebin J.A. Stern D.F. Link V.C. Weinberg R.A. Greene M.I. Nature. 1984; 312: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (3000/well) of each cell line were seeded in 96-well plates overnight in DMEM containing 5% FBS. Cells were starved in serum-free ITS-DMEM for 48 h, then cultured in 100 μl of the same medium plus various concentrations of EGF for another 48 h. 25 μl of MTT solution (5 μg/ml in PBS) were added to each well, and after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 100 μl of the extraction buffer (20% w/v SDS, 50% N,N-dimethyl formamide, pH 4.7) was added. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, the optical density at 600 nm was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Each value represents a mean of four samples. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-HA-ERK2 (a gift from Silvio Gutkind, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and pSRαEGFR/hygr, along with either empty vector or plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant p185c-neu using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and assayed 48 h after transfection. Cells deprived of serum for 16–20 h were treated with or without EGF (50 ng/ml) for 5 min. For MAP kinase assay, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (100 μg) from cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA (BabCo). After washing extensively, the immunocomplexes were then incubated with 50 μl of reaction buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and 2 μg of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated myelin basic protein was visualized by autoradiography. PI 3-kinase immune complex assays were carried out as described (45Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madrugal M. Emlet D.R. Montgomery R.B. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Equal amounts of protein (600 μg) from cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 3 h. Protein A-Sepharose was then added and rotated at 4 °C for overnight. Immunocomplexes were washed twice with lysis buffer; twice with 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 m LiCl, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, plus 0.2 mm adenosine; and twice with reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl). The beads were resuspended in 40 μl of reaction buffer containing substrate mixture (phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylserine dispersed by sonication in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA). The tubes were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and reaction were initiated by adding 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) per reaction in 5 μl of 500 mm ATP and terminated by addition of 80 μl of CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1) after another 10 min. Phospholipids were extracted, desiccated, and redissolved as described (45Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madrugal M. Emlet D.R. Montgomery R.B. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The samples were the chromatographed on thin layer chromatography plates (precoated with potassium oxalate and baked at 100 °C for 1 h before use) in CHCl3:CHOH:2.5 mNH4OH:H2O (45:35:2.7:7.3). Spots corresponding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate were visualized after autoradiography. Unlabeled phospholipid standards were included and were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor. Cell lines expressing EGFR and various p185neu deletion mutant proteins derived from full-length transforming p185neu were all generated in the NR6 cell background (43Pruss R.M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3918-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In addition, stable transfectants derived from NR6 fibroblasts expressing human EGFR (termed NE91 cells) were also generated. NE91 cells, as well as NR6 parental cells, were then transfected with various p185neu cDNA constructs to express one of the following mutant p185neu proteins with or without EGFR, respectively (Fig. 1): (a) Er/p185neu or p185neu (full-length oncogenic p185neu product), (b) Er/T691stop or T691stop (lacking 591 aa from the carboxyl terminus), (c) Er/TAPstop or TAPstop (a 122-aa truncation at carboxyl terminus), and (d) Er/TΔ5 or TΔ5 (an ectodomain deleted p185neu product, also termed TΔ5). A schematic representation of the oncogenic p185neu protein and its mutant derivative species is shown in Fig. 1. B104-1-1 murine fibroblasts transformed by the expression of oncogenic p185neu were used as a positive control, since surface expression of p185neu, biochemical features of p185neu homodimerization and p185neu transforming potency have been characterized previously (13Weiner D.B. Kokai Y. Wada T. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1175-1183PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kokai Y. Myers J.N. Wada T. Brown V.I. LeVea C.M. Davis J.G. Dobashi K. Greene M.I.

As shown in TableI, relative expression levels of various p185neu mutant proteins in selected clones were estimated by a comparison with B104-1-1 cells, while the expression of EGFR in these cells was estimated by Scatchard analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2044246876,"We investigated interaction of an RNA domain covering the target site of α-sarcin and ricin (sarcin/ricin domain) of Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA with ribosomal proteins. RNA fragments comprising residues 2630–2788 (Tox-1) and residues 2640–2774 (Tox-2) of 23 S rRNA were transcribed in vitroand used to analyze the binding proteins by gel shift and filter binding. Protein L6 bound to both Tox-1 (K d: 0.31 μm) and Tox-2 (K d: 0.18 μm), and L3 bound only to Tox-1 (K d: 0.069 μm) in a solution containing 10 mmMgCl2 and 175 mm KCl at 0 °C. Footprinting studies were performed using the chemical probe dimethyl sulfate on full-length 23 S rRNA. Binding of L6 protected a single base, A-2757, and strongly enhanced reactivity of C-2752. A direct role of A-2757 in the L6 binding was verified by site-directed mutagenesis; replacements of A-2757 with G and C impaired the L6 binding. On the other hand, binding of L3 protected A-2632, A-2634, A-2635, A-2675, A-2726, A-2733, A-2749, and A-2750. Interestingly, binding of L6 and L3 together protected additional bases A-2657, A-2662, C-2666, and C-2667 in the sarcin/ricin loop, in addition to A-2740, A-2741, A-2748, A-2753, A-2764, A-2765, and A-2766 in the other stem-loop. This appears to be due to cooperative interaction of L3 and L6 with the RNA. The results are discussed with respect to conformational modulation of the sarcin/ricin domain by the protein binding. We investigated interaction of an RNA domain covering the target site of α-sarcin and ricin (sarcin/ricin domain) of Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA with ribosomal proteins.

This appears to be due to cooperative interaction of L3 and L6 with the RNA. The results are discussed with respect to conformational modulation of the sarcin/ricin domain by the protein binding. It is generally recognized that rRNA plays a fundamental role in translation and associated ribosomal proteins help it by modulating the conformation and dynamics of rRNA (reviewed in Ref. 1Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 191-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Detailed knowledge of rRNA-protein interaction is, therefore, important to understand the mechanism of action of rRNA, particularly of the conserved functional regions. The sarcin/ricin loop comprising residues 2653–2667 in domain VI of Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA is one of the most notable regions, since this includes an important site of interaction of elongation factors EF-G 1The abbreviations used are: EF, elongation factor; DMS, dimethyl sulfate. and EF-Tu with the ribosome (2Hausner T.P.

It is not clear whether a certain ribosomal protein interacts with this region and affects the conformation in the ribosome, although a model of the three-dimensional structure of this loop region has been built up on the basis of NMR data (7Szewczak A.A. Moore P.B. Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9581-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 8Szewczak A.A. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). There is evidence suggesting that assembly of ribosomal proteins to 23 S rRNA changes a feature of the sarcin/ricin loop region; (a) many sites at or near the loop region in the naked rRNA are much more reactive with a variety of chemicals and ribonucleases than those in the 50 S subunit (9Leffers H. Egebjerg J. Andersen A. Christensen T. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 507-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and (b) this loop region is accessible to ricin in the naked 23 S rRNA, but not in the intactE. coli ribosome (6Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Leffer et al. (9Leffers H. Egebjerg J. Andersen A. Christensen T. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 507-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) identified proteins L3 and L6 that bound to domain VI comprising residues 2629 to the 3′ end of 23 S rRNA. By a footprinting approach, they localized the major binding site for L3 on the 2630–2644/2771–2788 stem, a root of the large RNA domain including the sarcin/ricin loop region, but failed to determine the L6 binding site (9Leffers H. Egebjerg J. Andersen A. Christensen T. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 507-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the binding affinity of L6 to rRNA is low (9Leffers H. Egebjerg J. Andersen A. Christensen T. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 507-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Spierer P. Zimmermann R.A. Mackie G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this ability is supported by recent crystallographic data on this protein that show a domain structure homologous with a large family of RNA binding proteins (11Golden B.L. Ramakrishnan V. White S.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Protein L6 is interesting with respect to the location and function in the ribosome. Data on immunoelectron microscopy and protein-protein cross-linking indicate that L6 is located in a position close to the base of L7/L12 stalk and to proteins L10 and L11 (12Stöffler-Meilicke M.

Biochem. 1982; 127: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence suggest that L6 is one of the members constructing the factor binding site in the ribosome. We here investigate the interaction of the RNA domain containing the sarcin/ricin loop region of 23 S rRNA (termed here the sarcin/ricin domain) with ribosomal proteins by gel retardation and footprinting, and demonstrate that L6 directly binds to a site within residues 2640–2774 of 23 S rRNA. By footprinting, we also show that L6, together with L3, protects 4 bases in the sarcin/ricin loop against chemical modification. Our data provide valuable information about features of the sarcin/ricin domain in the ribosome. The DNA fragments comprising residues 2630–2788 (Tox-1), and residues 2640–2774 (Tox-2) (see Fig. 4) were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (20Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Share S.J. Higuchi R. Hoen G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13561) Google Scholar), and inserted into HindIII andXbaI sites of an expression vector, pSPT18 (Boehringer Mannheim). Base substitutions of A-2757 with G and C in Tox-2 were performed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in polymerase chain reaction (21Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar) using primers containing the individual mutations. DNA sequences of the obtained constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52928) Google Scholar). The plasmid construction for the RNA fragment containing residues 1029–1127 (corresponds to the GTPase domain) of 23 S rRNA was as described previously (23Uchiumi T. Wada A. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29889-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The RNA fragments were synthesized in a solution (200 μl) containing 1,000 units of SP-6 RNA polymerase, 4 μg of template DNA linearized at the XbaI site, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 14 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm spermidine, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 mm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP, and 0.5 mm UTP (supplemented with 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP). The transcripts were purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The large ribosomal subunits were prepared from E. coli Q13, as described previously (24Wada A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Total proteins (TP50) extracted from the subunits (25Hardy S.J.S. Kurland C.G. Voynow P. Mora G.

A part of each fraction was dialyzed against the renaturation buffer consisting of 0.35m KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and tested for binding to Tox-1 by gel retardation, as described below. Protein fractions containing the binding activity were further purified by high performance ion-exchange chromatography; the protein fractions were applied to a CM-5PW column (Tosoh) equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 6 m urea, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 80 mm LiCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and eluted with a linear gradient of 80–280 mm LiCl. The isolated proteins were concentrated with Centricon-10 (Amicon), dialyzed against the renaturation buffer, and tested for the binding to Tox-1. Identification of the isolated proteins were performed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24Wada A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and amino acid sequencing of the N termini (Applied Biosystems). A solution (5 μl) containing 5 pmol of the [32P]RNA fragments, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.35 m KCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was preincubated at 40 °C for 20 min. After addition of 5 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and a protein sample as indicated in the figure legends, the mixture was incubated further at 30 °C for 10 min. RNA-protein binding was examined by electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 40:1) at 6.5 V/cm, with buffer recirculation at 4 °C. The two buffer systems were used in gel analyses; system 1 contained 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and system 2 contained 4 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tris-boric acid, pH 7.6. Radiolabeled RNA fragments (5 pmol for L6 binding and 1 pmol for L3 binding) were preincubated at 40 °C for 20 min in 50 μl of 350 mm KCl, 20 mmMgCl2, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. By mixing with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and a protein sample, the solution was adjusted to 100 μl. The mixture was incubated for another 10 min at 30 °C, and then placed on ice for 10 min. The reaction mixture was filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, type HA, 0.45-μm pore size, 25-mm diameter) as described by Draper et al. (26Draper D.E. Deckman I.C. Vartikar J.V. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 203-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The filter was counted for 32P using a Beckman LS6000IC Analyzer. A background determined by filtration in the absence of proteins was subtracted from each assay. The data were fitted by nonlinear least-squares analysis with a hyperbolic binding function using Prism 2 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA), and theK d values were derived from three experiments. The 23 S rRNA were prepared from the isolated 50 S subunits by phenol extraction and sucrose gradient centrifugation. The 23 S rRNA (20 pmol) was preincubated at 40 °C for 10 min in 25 μl of solution containing 20 mmMgCl2, 350 mm KCl, 50 mm potassium cacodylate, pH 7.2. After adding protein samples, 50 pmol of L3, 100 pmol of L6, or both the proteins, and 50 mm potassium cacodylate, pH 7.2, the solution (50 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Chemical modification was started by addition of DMS (1 μl; 1:4 dilution in ethanol), followed by incubation at 30 °C for 15 min. The modified RNA samples were recovered and used as templates of primer extension, as described by Moazed and Noller (27Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1986; 47: 985-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The used primers were 5′-GGAGAACTCATCTCGGGG-3′ and 5′-GTCGTCGTCTTCAACGTT-3′ complementary to residues 2771–2788 and 2813–2830 of 23 S rRNA, respectively. Synthetic RNA fragments that mimic the local structure of rRNA have been widely employed to investigate RNA-protein interactions (4Munishkin A. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study, we synthesized two RNA fragments covering the sarcin/ricin domain of E. coli 23 S rRNA to investigate the interaction of the RNA region with 50 S ribosomal proteins: Tox-1 comprising residues 1630–1788 and Tox-2 comprising residues 2640–2774 (see Fig. 4). Protein binding to the RNA fragments was assayed by gel retardation for each protein fraction separated with CM-cellulose column and for high performance liquid chromatography-purified proteins (see “Materials and Methods”). Two proteins showed ability to interact with Tox-1. They were identified as L3 and L6 by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino acid sequencing of the N termini (data not shown). Fig.1 A shows the purity of isolated L3 (lane 2) and L6 (lane 3) samples used for the binding experiments. As shown in Fig. 1 B, L3 strongly bound to Tox-1 (lane 2), but not to Tox-2 (lane 5) or to a control RNA fragment containing residues 1029–1127 covering the GTPase domain (lane 8). L6 protein, on the other hand, showed a weak affinity for both Tox-1 (lane 3) and Tox-2 (lane 6), but not for the GTPase domain (lane 9). This gel condition containing 50 mm KCl (system 1, Fig. 1 B) did not detect the stable L6-RNA complex, but another gel system excluding KCl (system 2, Fig. 1 C) showed the L6-RNA complex as a clear band with Tox-1 (lanes 3 and 4), and Tox-2 (lanes 7 and 8) depending on concentrations of added L6. No complex was detected between L6 and the GTPase domain even in system 2 (see lanes 10–12). Binding affinities of L3 and L6 for the RNAs were examined by filter binding assay (Fig. 2). The RNA fragments Tox-1, Tox-2, and GTPase domain were titrated with proteins L3 (Fig.2 A) and L6 (Fig. 2 B). L3 bound to Tox-1 with a high affinity (K d: 0.069 ± 0.025 μm), whereas L6 bound to Tox-1 and Tox-2 with lower affinities (K d: 0.31 ± 0.10 μmand 0.18 ± 0.06 μm, respectively). There was no appreciable binding either of L3 to Tox-2 or the GTPase domain or of L6 to the GTPase domain. These binding data suggest that the primary binding site for L6 lies within Tox-2 and that for L3 in the 2630–2639/2775–2788 region, which remains in Tox-1 and is deleted in Tox-2. Binding sites for L3 and L6 in 23 S rRNA were further analyzed by DMS-footprinting. Sites of the chemical modification (at N-1 of adenine and N-3 of cytosine) in the presence or absence of proteins were localized by primer-extension, followed by gel electrophoresis (Fig.3). Binding of L3 protected bases A-2632, A-2634, A-2635, A-2675, A-2726, A-2733, A-2749, and A-2750 and enhanced the modification at A-2734 (lane 2). These bases lie in the 2630–2643/2771–2788 stem, the 2675–2733 stem, and the 2747–2757 loop (Fig. 4). Binding of L6 caused marked protection at A-2757 and enhancement at C-2752 (Fig. 3,lane 3) within the conserved loop region of residues 2747–2757 (Fig. 4). L6 also enhanced C-2699 weakly, but obviously. No effect was observed in the sarcin/ricin loop comprising residues 2653–2667 by the individual bindings. However, additions of L3 and L6 together newly caused strong protection of 4 bases in this loop region, A-2657, A-2662, C-2666, and C-2667, in addition to A-2740, A-2741, A-2748, A-2753, A-2764, A-2765, and A-2766 in the stem-loop of residues 2735–2769 (Figs. 3, lane 4, and 4). We infer that these effects given by the combination of L3 and L6 reflect a cooperative interaction of the two proteins with the RNA. Despite the physical binding of L6 to Tox-2 (Figs. 1 and 2), our DMS-footprinting data showed protection of only A-2757 in this region (Fig. 3). To clarify whether A-2757 is involved in L6 binding, we performed a site-directed mutagenesis. Effect of base substitutions of A-2757 with G and C on L6 binding to Tox-2 was tested by gel retardation in system 2. As shown in Fig.5, the binding was disrupted by either A to C transversion (lane 4) or A to G transition (lane 6). These results combined with the footprinting data suggest that A-2757 plays a direct role in L6 binding to the RNA. Little has been known about ribosomal proteins assembled to an RNA domain including the conserved sarcin/ricin loop region. The present study demonstrates that protein L6 directly binds to a limited region within residues 2640–2774 (Tox-2). The marked effects of L6 binding on DMS modification is localized in the conserved loop of residues 2747–2757: protection of A-2757 and enhancement of C-2752 (Fig. 4). In addition, replacement of this protected base A-2757 with G or C causes disruption of L6 binding (Fig. 5). The results suggest that L6 recognizes a local structure including A-2757 within Tox-2 as a primary binding site. The present results are in line with previous data on RNA binding ability of L6 to the 3′ half (10Spierer P. Zimmermann R.A. Mackie G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and to domain VI of 23 S rRNA (9Leffers H. Egebjerg J. Andersen A. Christensen T. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 507-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and also consistent with cross-linking between a mammalian homologue (L9) of E. coli L6 and ricin A chain, which attacks the sarcin/ricin loop (30Vater C.A. Bartle L.M. Leszyk J.D. Lambert J.M. Goldmacher V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12933-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, L6 is cross-linked to a region of residues 2473–2481 of domain V of 23 S rRNA with 2-iminothiolane (31Wower I. Wower J. Meinke M. Brimacombe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4285-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), although direct binding of L6 to an RNA fragment for domain V was not detected (9Leffers H. Egebjerg J. Andersen A. Christensen T. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 507-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is presumed that the 2473–2481 region of domain V lies in the close proximity to, if not directly interacts with, L6 in the ribosome. Another protein, L3, strongly binds to Tox-1, but not to Tox-2, suggesting that the region of residues 2630–2639/2775–2788 lacking in Tox-2 is the major binding site for L3. This is consistent with previous footprinting data by Leffers et al. (9Leffers H. Egebjerg J. Andersen A. Christensen T. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 507-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In our footprinting study, L3 protects not only 3 bases in the 2630–2639/2775–2788 region, but also 5 bases in Tox-2 region (Fig.4). Therefore, together with the 2630–2639/2775–2788 region, some parts within Tox-2 may constitute L3 binding site. Interestingly, our footprinting data also reveal additional protections at the sarcin/ricin loop by the combination of L3 and L6; bases A-2657, A-2662, C-2666, and C-2667 in the sarcin/ricin loop in addition to 7 bases in another stem-loop of residues 2735–2769 are protected by binding of L3 and L6 together (Fig. 4). All of these positions are not reactive with DMS within the 50 S subunit (data not shown), suggesting that the present data reflect the structural feature of the sarcin/ricin domain in the intact ribosome. It is not clear, however, at present whether these additional protections are caused by contact with protein(s) or conformational change of the RNA induced by the two proteins. L3 is known as one of the important proteins bound earliest during the subunit assembly (32Nowotny V. Nierhaus K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7238-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and expected to induce a conformational change of 23 S rRNA, which leads to the next step of the 50 S subunit assembly. Therefore, it is most likely that L3 binding affects a conformation of the Tox-2 region, although there is no detectable effect of L3 alone on the DMS modification at the sarcin/ricin loop. From these considerations, we deduce a tentative model of the RNA folding: the 2630–2644/2771–2788 stem and the 2675–2732 stem fold close together in one side by the strong L3 binding, and in the other side, the sarcin/ricin loop region and the 2735–2769 stem-loop region become closer as much as L6 interacts with both regions and protects them. Further extensive investigations are required to elucidate the mechanism of this cooperative interaction of L3 and L6 with the RNA. The position of L6 near the base of the L7/L12 stalk in the 50 S ribosomal subunit has been established from immunoelectron microscopy (12Stöffler-Meilicke M. Noah M. Stöffler G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6780-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Walleczek J. Schüler D. Stöffler-Meilicke M. Brimacombe R. Stöffler G.

Kramer G. Structure, Function and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag, New York1985: 286-308Google Scholar). In addition, this area underneath the L7/L12 stalk has been observed as the binding site for EF-G (15Girshovich A.S. Kurtskhalia T.V. Ovchinnikov Y.A. Vasiliev V.D. FEBS Lett. 1981; 130: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6134-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and EF-Tu (17Girshovich A.S. Bochkareva E.S. Vasiliev V.D. FEBS Lett. 1986; 197: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Rinke-Appel J. Brimacombe R. Wintermeyer W. van Heel M. Nature. 1997; 389: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that the sarcin/ricin RNA domain (Tox-2) of residues 2640–2774 in 23 S rRNA interacts directly with L6, implying that this RNA domain is situated in the vicinity of L6 at the factor binding site for EF-G and EF-Tu in the ribosome. This is consistent with the facts that EF-G is cross-linked to L6 (19Sköld S.-E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that both of EF-G and EF-Tu protects the sarcin/ricin loop from chemical modification (3Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Besides the sarcin/ricin domain, another conserved RNA domain termed the GTPase domain (or thiostrepton binding site) in domain II of 23 S rRNA (33Schmidt F.J. Thompson J. Lee K. Dijk J. Cundliffe E.

Biol. 1993; 234: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) is known to interact with EF-G (3Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 4Munishkin A. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12280-12284Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These two RNA domains appear to collaborate in EF-G-dependent process of translation, although the two domains are distant in the primary and secondary structure of 23 S rRNA. It is of interest to see the topographical relationship between the sarcin/ricin domain and the GTPase domain on a model of protein topography (Fig.6). Since the sarcin/ricin domain is situated near L6 (present study) and the GTPase domain on L11 (28Ryan P.C. Lu M. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Schmidt F.J. Thompson J. Lee K. Dijk J. Cundliffe E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12301-12305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the two RNA domains are expected to be adjacent to each other. This view is strongly supported by recent evidence from directed hydroxyl radical probing for EF-G binding site (37Wilson K.S. Noller H. Cell. 1998; 92: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), i.e. both the sarcin/ricin domain and the GTPase domain are cleaved by the same EF-G conjugated with Fe (II) at position 650 of the molecule. The vicinity of these two RNA domains may explain the fact that binding of thiostrepton to the GTPase domain inhibits accessibility of the sarcin/ricin loop for α-sarcin (38Miller S.P. Bodley J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1657-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. R. Kominami (Niigata University) for helpful discussion and critical reading of the manuscript and Dr. S. Odani (Niigata University) for helpful advice on the binding experiments."

In contrast to the monomeric Anabaena nuclease, the Serratianuclease is a dimer of two identical subunits. To find out whether the two active sites of the Serratia nuclease function independently of each other and what the advantage of being a dimer for this enzyme might be, we produced (i) dimers in which the two subunits were cross-linked, (ii) heterodimers consisting of a wild type and an inactive mutant subunit which were also cross-linked, and (iii) monomeric variants which are unable to dimerize. The monomeric H184R variant and the cross-linked S140C variant exhibit the same activity as the wild type enzyme, while the cross-linked heterodimer with one inactive subunit shows only half of the activity of the wild type enzyme, demonstrating functional independence of the two subunits of the Serratia nuclease. On the other hand at low enzyme and substrate concentrations dimeric forms of the Serratianuclease are relatively more active than monomeric forms or the monomeric Anabaena nuclease in cleaving polynucleotides, not, however, oligonucleotides, which is correlated with the ability of dimeric forms of the Serratia nuclease to form large enzyme-substrate networks with high molecular weight DNA and to cleave polynucleotides in a processive manner. We conclude that in the natural habitat of Serratia marcescens where the supply of nutrients may become growth limiting the dimeric nuclease can fulfil its nutritive function more efficiently than a monomeric enzyme.

Many enzymes are dimers of identical subunits each of which harbors one active site. Only in a few cases is it obvious that the dimeric state is essential for enzymatic activity, the paradigm being type II restriction endonucleases. These are usually dimers of identical subunits which together form one DNA-binding site, and have two catalytic centers, one per subunit, which cleave the two strands of the DNA in a concerted fashion (1Roberts R.J.

Nature. 1997; 390: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). Although the nucleases of this family occur ubiquitously their cellular roles are often unknown or poorly understood. The bovine EndoG nuclease is known to be involved in generating primers for the mitochondrial DNA replication by cleaving GC-rich sequences in the displacement loop of mitochondrial DNA and in the region upstream of the mitochondrial tRNAPhe gene (16Ruiz-Carrillo A. Côté J. Science. 1993; 261: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and has been discussed to be involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA by eliminating defective genomes from the multicopy pool (20Ikeda S. Maeda N. Ohshima T. Takata N. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 1017-1024PubMed Google Scholar). NUC1 from S. cerevisiae seems to be involved in DNA recombination and DNA repair. However, null mutants which lack the NUC1 gene show the wild type phenotype (21Zassenhaus H.P. Hofmann T.J. Uthayashanker R. Vincent R.D. Zona M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3283-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The secreted nucleases from prokaryotic organisms, namelySerratia nuclease, Anabaena nuclease, and EndA from S. pneumoniae most likely fulfil a nutritive function by providing the bacterial cell in its natural habitat with precursors for nucleic acid synthesis. They also may act as bactericides to inhibit the growth of competing organisms. This was shown to be important for efficient transformation of S. pneumonia (9Puyet A. Greenberg B. Lacks S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). They may also constitute virulence factors. Among this family of nucleases the Serratia (for review, see Ref. 22Benedik M.J. Strych U. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 165: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the Anabaena nuclease are by far the best studied enzymes. Both enzymes, Serratia nuclease secreted by the Gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens (23Eaves G.N. Jeffries C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1963; 85: 273-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yonemura K.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3021-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are largely nonspecific endonucleases which cleave double- and single-stranded DNA and RNA and produce 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides. For the Serratianuclease the three-dimensional structure is known (5Miller M.D. Krause K.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Miller M.D. Tanner J. Alpaugh M.

Anabaenanuclease recently has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed inEscherichia coli (10Muro-Pastor A.M. Flores E. Herrero A. Wolk C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3021-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Muro-Pastor A.M. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and biochemically characterized in detail (6Meiss G. Franke I. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is the only representative of this group whose intracellular activity is regulated by the polypeptide inhibitor NuiA which is specific for the Anabaena nuclease, as it does not inhibit the activity of the related Serratianuclease (6Meiss G. Franke I. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Muro-Pastor A.M. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Serratia nuclease is not active intracellularly because two disulfide bonds are essential for its nucleolytic function (34Ball T.K. Sih Y. Benedik M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4971-4974Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which are not formed prior to secretion into the oxidizing milieu of the periplasma. The active site of these nucleases is characterized by the DRGH motif typical for this family of nucleases. It contains the essential histidine, His89 in Serratia nuclease, which presumably acts as the general base to generate the active nucleophile for phosphodiester bond cleavage. The nucleolytic activity requires divalent metal ions like Mg2+ or Mn2+ which inSerratia nuclease are bound by Asn119. 2K. Krause, personal communication. The metal ion cofactor could be involved in polarization of the P-O bond to make the phosphorus more accessible for a nucleophilic attack and together with Arg57 stabilize the phosphorane intermediate in the transition state. Glu127 seems to be involved in protonation of the leaving group. These residues are conserved in theSerratia family of nucleases and their essential function has been demonstrated for Serratia nuclease (29Friedhoff P. Kolmes B. Gimadutdinow O. Wende W. Krause K.L. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Friedhoff P. Meiss G. Kolmes B. Pieper U. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Kolmes B. Franke I. Friedhoff P. Pingoud A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as well as for Anabaenanuclease. 3G. Meiss, O. Gimadutdinow, and A. Pingoud, manuscript in preparation. While it appears from a comparison of the properties of these two nucleases that they have a similar mechanism of action (6Meiss G. Franke I. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), they differ as mentioned above in their quaternary structure. The question, of course, arises, whether the dimeric structure of Serratianuclease leads to a functional dependence of the two active sites, a question that cannot easily be resolved by kinetic studies, as the enzyme is subjected to a monomer/dimer equilibrium and attacks nucleic acids at many sites with different rates which obscures any analysis regarding cooperative effects (31Friedhoff P. Meiss G. Kolmes B. Pieper U. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, taken another approach, namely to produce monomeric and cross-linked homo- and heterodimeric variants of the Serratia nuclease and to compare their nucleolytic activity and mechanism of action toward different nucleic acid substrates. Our results demonstrate that the subunits of Serratia nuclease are functionally independent, but that the dimeric state of this enzyme is of advantage at very low enzyme and substrate concentration, because it allows theSerratia nuclease to stay associated with high molecular weight nucleic acids and to cleave them in a processive manner. For the cloning and expression of the wild type and the mutant genes of Serratia nuclease the vector pHisNuc (4Friedhoff P. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3280-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was used. Anabaena nuclease was cloned and overexpressed using the pBBINucA expression vector (6Meiss G. Franke I. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cloning of pHisNuc and pBBINucA was performed in E. coli K12 LK111(λ) (35Zabeau M. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For the overexpression of Serratia nuclease E. coli K12 TGE900 and for Anabaena nuclease E. coli BL21(DE3)LysS (36Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) were used. E. coli DH5α (37Woodcock D.M. Crowther P.J. Doherty J. Jefferson S. DeCruz E. Noyer-Weidner M. Smith S.S. Michael M.Z. Graham M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3469-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) was used for the propagation of the plasmid pBSK+ (Stratagene) to achieve a maximum yield of supercoiled plasmid DNA. The pBSK+ plasmid was isolated using alkaline lysis (38Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar,39Ish-Horowicz D. Burke J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) followed by differential nucleic acid precipitation using a modified protocol from (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The double mutant H89A,S140C variant of Serratia nuclease was generated by ligating the BamHI/ClaI fragment of the gene of the H89A variant (28Friedhoff P. Gimadutdinow O. Rüter T. Wende W. Urbanke C. Thole H. Pingoud A. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) into pHisNuc (S140C) (41Franke I. Pingoud A. J. Prot. Chem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) which had been digested with the same restriction endonucleases. The double mutant S140C,H184R and H89A,H184R variants were generated applying an inverse polymerase chain reaction strategy (6Meiss G. Franke I. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by sequencing the whole gene using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase FS, on an ABI 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the supplier's protocol. pStrepIINuc is a derivative of pHisNuc in which the codons for the N-terminal His6-tag were replaced by codons for the Strep-tag II. Proteins with the Strep-tag II bind to StrepTactin, a mutant of streptavidine (42Schmidt T.G.M. Koepke J. Frank R. Skerra A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 43Voss S. Skerra A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast to the original Strep-tag the Strep-tag II can be employed not only as a C-terminal fusion peptide but also as a linker between protein domains or as an N-terminal fusion peptide. The original sequence, CATCATCATCACCATCAC, coding for the His6-tag was excised as a HindIII/BamHI fragment from pHisNuc and replaced by a cassette containing the coding sequence, TCTGCTTGGTCTCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAAA, for the Strep-tag II (Ser-Ala-Trp-Ser-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Glu-Lys). Codons most frequently used in E. coli were employed. Positive clones were identified by polymerase chain reaction screening using a forward primer specific for the codons of the Strep-tag II and a reverse primer binding to the 3′-region of the Serratia nuclease gene. Positive clones were verified by sequencing as described above. The newly generated expression vector containing the gene of Serratia nuclease was named pStrepIINuc. As in E. coli all overexpressed variants ofSerratia and Anabaena nuclease are produced as inclusion bodies, in all cases a denaturing-renaturing purification procedure was used (28Friedhoff P. Gimadutdinow O. Rüter T. Wende W. Urbanke C. Thole H. Pingoud A. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Anabaena nuclease was overexpressed as the His6-tagged protein and purified as described previously (6Meiss G. Franke I. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These highly active nucleases can be expressed inE. coli, as they are inactive intracellularly, either because they require for activity disulfide bonds to be formed (Serratia nuclease) or because they are kept in an inactive state due to the presence of a specific polypeptide inhibitor (Anabaena nuclease). Wild type Serratia nuclease and the variant enzymes H89A, S140C, H184R, H89A,S140C, and H89A,H184R were produced as His6-tagged proteins and purified as described (4Friedhoff P. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3280-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Friedhoff P. Kolmes B. Gimadutdinow O. Wende W. Krause K.L. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In a modification of the previously described purification procedure we employed for some enzyme preparations an additional gel filtration purification step using a Beckmann Biosys 2000 HPLC system and a Merck Superformance 600-16 Fractogel EMD BioSEC (S) which removes inactive aggregates from the preparation of the His6-tagged proteins. With this extra step the specific activity of the nuclease increases from 1 × 106 units mg−1 to 3–4 × 106 units mg−1. The S140C variant was also produced with the Strep-tag II as an N-terminal affinity peptide. Overexpression of the nuclease was carried out in the same way as described for the His6-tagged variants (4Friedhoff P. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3280-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The inclusion bodies formed after induction of a 1-liter culture were first solubilized using 6 m urea and then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, allowing the nuclease to refold. The solution containing the native nuclease was then applied to a StrepTactin column with 1-ml bed volume which binds specifically to the Strep-tag II (44Gerdes W. Kiem K.-P. Schmidt T.G.M. Biospektrum. 1998; 1: 73Google Scholar). After washing the column with 3 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, the protein was eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 2.5 mm desthiobiotin in six fractions of 0.5 ml. After dialysis against 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.2, the protein was stored at 4 °C. Obligatory dimers of Serratianuclease were generated by chemical cross-linking of the S140C variant (and other variants carrying the Ser140 → Cys substitution) across the dimer interface at Cys140 using the SH-specific bismaleimidohexane as cross-linking reagent (41Franke I. Pingoud A. J. Prot. Chem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Obligatory monomers were obtained by replacing His184 which is located in the dimer interface of Serratia nuclease (5Miller M.D. Krause K.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) by Ala, Thr, Asn, and Arg (45Franke I. Meiss G. Blecher D. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure analysis of Serratianuclease variants and of Anabaena nuclease was carried out using gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation (6Meiss G. Franke I. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Friedhoff P. Gimadutdinow O. Rüter T. Wende W. Urbanke C. Thole H. Pingoud A. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,45Franke I. Meiss G. Blecher D. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration experiments were performed at 25 °C on a Beckmann Biosys 2000 HPLC system using a Pharmacia Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column. The protein concentration of the 100-μl sample applied to the column was 40 μm. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out at 20 °C and 45,000 min−1 in a Beckmann Optima XL-A centrifuge equipped with absorption optics and an An-50 8-place rotor. The protein concentration was 6 μm. Sedimentation velocity data were evaluated with the program package AKKUPROG (46.Kindler, B., PhD. thesis, 1997, Universität Hannover.Google Scholar). An obligatory heterodimer of Serratianuclease consisting of a wild type subunit and one subunit with an active site mutation was generated using the His6-tagged H89A,S140C variant which is catalytically inactive and the StrepII-tagged variant S140C which has wild type activity (Fig. 2). Both variants were overexpressed and purified separately. A stoichometric mixture of both variants was then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 6 m urea to denature the protein. The refolding and stochastic formation of His6-tagged/His6-tagged (denoting: subunit 1/subunit 2), His6-tagged/StrepII-tagged and StrepII-tagged/StrepII-tagged dimers were achieved by dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. The dimers obtained were cross-linked using the same procedure that was used to generate the cross-linked S140C homodimer (41Franke I. Pingoud A. J. Prot. Chem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). To separate the heterodimer from the two homodimeric forms the solution containing the mixture of dimers was first applied to a Ni2+-NTA column which binds only the His6-tagged homodimers and the heterodimer. After the StrepII-tagged homodimer was removed by washing the column with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, the protein was eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 200 mm imidazole and after dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, applied to a StrepTactin column. The His6-tagged homodimers appeared in the flow-through and in the wash with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. The heterodimer was eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. As the His6-tagged and the StrepII-tagged variant have almost the same molecular weight, they cannot be distinguished by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To ensure that we indeed purified the heterodimer described above we applied a His6-tagged variant to a StrepTactin column and a StrepII-tagged variant to a Ni2+-NTA column. After washing with the same amount of buffer that was used in the procedure to prepare the heterodimer, all nucleolytic activity appeared in the flow-through and the wash. CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-710 circular dichrograph in 0.05-cm cells at protein concentrations of 5 μm as described previously (28Friedhoff P. Gimadutdinow O. Rüter T. Wende W. Urbanke C. Thole H. Pingoud A. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The DNase activity ofAnabaena nuclease and the different variants ofSerratia nuclease were determined using a hyperchromicity assay (47Kunitz M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1950; 33: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) with high molecular weight DNA from herring sperm as described previously (31Friedhoff P. Meiss G. Kolmes B. Pieper U. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Plasmid cleavage assays were performed at 37 °C (steady state experiments) or 25 °C (pre-steady state experiments which were carried out in a quenched-flow apparatus (Biologic)) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 5 mm MgCl2 with Serratia nuclease variants and in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMnCl2, 0.01% (w/v) Lubrol with Anabaenanuclease. Protein concentrations varied between 5 × 101 and 2.5 × 106 units liter−1. Cleavage products were analyzed using native 0.8% Tris borate-agarose gels. The gels were quantified by densitometry using a video documentation system (Intas). For the coprecipitation of theSerratia nuclease in the presence of DNA due to the formation of enzyme-DNA networks the nuclease was incubated at a concentration of 10 μm with 0.05 mg ml−1high molecular weight DNA from herring sperm in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 5 mm MgCl2, respectively. Visually apparent precipitation was taken as an indicator for the formation of very high molecular weight enzyme-DNA complexes. To demonstrate that these complexes consist of DNA and enzyme the precipitate after centrifugation was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the presence of nuclease. The supernatant was analyzed for the decrease in DNA content by measuring the UV absorbance at 260 nm. It has been the aim of this study to compare the properties and activities of obligatory monomeric and obligatory dimeric variants ofSerratia nuclease and for reference, of Anabaenanuclease which is a monomer. For this purpose we had prepared obligatory monomeric variants of Serratia nuclease by substituting His184 by other amino acid residues that interfere with subunit-subunit interaction, e.g. H184R (Fig.1 (45Franke I. Meiss G. Blecher D. Gimadutdinow O. Urbanke C. Pingoud A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). We also had produced obligatory dimers by substituting Ser140 by Cys and cross-linking the two subunits of this Serratia nuclease variant via the Cys residues by specifically designed bismaleimides, e.g.S140C_X 4S140C_X denotes the cross-linked S140C dimer. An analogous abbreviation is used for the other cross-linkedSerratia nuclease variants. (Fig. 1 (41Franke I. Pingoud A. J. Prot. Chem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)). We have now prepared also a heterodimer of the Serratianuclease consisting of an active subunit (S140C) and an inactive subunit (H89A,S140C) in which the catalytically essential His89 is substituted by Ala (Fig. 1). For this purpose, two variants of Serratia nuclease were produced, the S140C variant carrying at its N terminus the Strep-tag II and the H89A,S140C variant carrying at its N terminus the His6-tag. Upon mixing, denaturation and renaturation of the two variants homo- and heterodimers are formed. To prevent sub"

The DNA-interacting proteins responsible for these changes as well as the mature protamines present in the ripe sperm nucleus have been characterized. The results reveal that spermiogenic nuclear proteins are protamine precursors that are subjected to a substantial number of small N-terminal deletions that gradually modify their overall charge. The composition of mature protamines is remarkably simple in turn, promoting an efficient and extremely tight packaging of DNA.

The composition of mature protamines is remarkably simple in turn, promoting an efficient and extremely tight packaging of DNA. The pattern of spermiogenic chromatin condensation in M. brandaris clearly departs from that corresponding to vertebrate chromatin. The current model for the nuclear changes occurring in spermiogenesis has been essentially drawn from studies on bony fishes and other vertebrates (1Louie A.J. Dixon G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7962-7968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Christensen M.E. Dixon G.H. Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 404-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Oliva R. Mezquita C.

The model considers that in early spermatids, histones become acetylated preceding their replacement by a highly basic protein (protamine). During histone displacement, the protamine is found polyphosphorylated, although it undergoes progressive dephosphorylation in the subsequent spermiogenic development. The processes of protamine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation imply a mechanism regulating the interaction with DNA. This mechanism allows for the orderly substitution of protamine for the nucleohistones and for the ensuing binding to DNA. The protamine is a small molecule displaying a very high positive charge density (6Saperas N. Ausió J. Lloris D. Chiva M. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Oliva R. Jamieson B.G.M. Ausió J. Justine J.L. Advances in Spermatozoal Taxonomy and Phylogeny. 166. Memoires du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris1995: 537-548Google Scholar). Consequently, the nuclear replacement of histones by protamine induces profound transitions in chromatin structure directly leading to the compactness of the sperm nucleus. Although these events are well established for some bony fishes and related vertebrates, there is not a universal pattern, or even a “more frequent” model, to account for spermiogenic processes. Evolution has generated an enormous diversity of both DNA-condensing proteins (8Kasinsky H.E. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins.

Traditionally, electron microscopy studies have focused on cenogastropod molluscs due to the complexity of their chromatin condensation patterns (13Buckland-Nicks J. Chia F.S.

Dev. 1990; 25: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Chromatin in the early haploid spermatid displays a somatic-like appearance, which immediately undergoes a peripheral migration, giving rise gradually to granular and fibrilar structures and finally to 18-nm lamellae (18Càceres C. Ribes E. Muller S. Cornudella L. Chiva M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 38: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The nascent lamellar structures are first seen in a disordered arrangement but later become progressively ordered in a regular concentric pattern surrounding the nuclear axis. The progression of structural changes in chromatin should be paralleled by simultaneous modifications of DNA-protein interactions, concurrently with thermodynamic restrictions on the size of the DNA-protein complexes (19Subirana J.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Casas M.T. Ausió J. Subirana J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It was found in a previous study (18Càceres C. Ribes E. Muller S. Cornudella L. Chiva M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 38: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that the histone complement of the immature gonads of M. brandarisbecomes replaced by a large set of intermediate proteins that lead to the final appearance of three small and simple protamine molecules in the sperm nucleus. It was also observed that these intermediate proteins reacted positively to antibodies elicited against a sperm protamine. In this paper, we report the primary structure of theM. brandaris mature protamines and show that one of them (protamine P1) is synthesized as a precursor molecule that undergoes a complex series of partial deletions in its N terminus in conjunction with a single step of dephosphorylation. The final forms of these mature protamines generate an almost extreme packing of sperm DNA . Male specimens of the mollusc M. brandaris were collected periodically on the Mediterranean coast of Spain and moved live to the laboratory in cold sea water. Either free-flowing sperm cells or gonadal tissue was homogenized separately in ice-cold buffer (0.25m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm benzamidine chloride as protease inhibitor) and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. Crude nuclear pellets were then rehomogenized and resedimented three times in the same buffer. The purified nuclear pellets were next homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mmNa2EDTA, followed by centrifugation and then one more time in the same buffer, omitting the chelating agent. The nuclear sediments thus obtained were used to extract proteins as well as for x-ray diffraction analyses. Proteins were extracted from purified sperm or gonadal nuclei with 0.4 n HCl, precipitated with 6 volumes of cold acetone, and finally rinsed with acidified acetone (21Chiva M. Kasinsky H.E. Subirana J.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 2: 237-240Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On one occasion, nuclear sediments were reduced with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C under N2 atmosphere and then alkylated with 12.5 mmiodoacetamide in the same buffer prior to HCl extraction (22Gusse M. Sautière P. Chauvière M. Chevaillier P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 748: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Saperas N. Chiva M. Bols N. Kulak D. Kasinsky H.E. Biol. Bull. 1993; 185: 186-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against protamine P1 were prepared as described previously (18Càceres C. Ribes E. Muller S. Cornudella L. Chiva M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 38: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, outbred New Zealand White female rabbits were multi-injected intradermally with 750 μg of protamine/animal. The antigen was previously emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant. The anti-protamine P1 antisera was tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified protamines. Western blotting of nuclear proteins from both sperm and gonads was performed according to Harlow and Lane (24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Following acetic acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes at 500 mA for 1 h at 4 °C in a solution of 0.7% acetic acid, 10% methanol. The membranes were washed in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS/T), blocked with PBS/T containing 0.1% gelatin for 2 h, and incubated with anti-protamine P1 antisera for 2 h at 37 °C. Detection was performed with diluted peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) and 4-chloro-1-naphtol as substrate. Chromatographic resolution of proteins in ion exchange columns was performed on CM-52 cellulose (Whatman). Protein samples were dissolved in 0.2 n NaCl, 50 mm acetate, pH 6.0, and loaded onto the column. Elution was carried out stepwise with 0.2 and 0.6 n NaCl, finally applying a linear gradient of NaCl concentrations from 0.6 to 2.0n in the same acetate buffer (25Chiva M. Kasinsky H.E. Mann M. Subirana J.A. J. Exp. Zool. 1988; 245: 304-317Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The collected fractions were dialyzed against 5 mm HCl and lyophilized. For reverse phase HPLC, 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. a C4, 300-Å Delta-Pack column (25 × 0.46 cm) was used. Proteins were eluted applying a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–25%) in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (26Buesa C. Del Valle L. Saperas N. Goethels M. Lloris D. Chiva M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 119B: 145-149Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). One-dimensional polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis was performed according to Panyim and Chalkley (27Panyim S. Chalkley R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar) with the modifications described by Hurley (28Hurley C.K. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 624-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis of proteins was carried out after hydrolysis of the samples in 6 n HCl (29Chiva M. Mezquita C. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the M. brandaris proteins was performed on a Procise Sequenator/ABI-492 (Perkin-Elmer) using the Pulsed Liquid 2HL program. The molecular mass of proteins was determined by ion spray mass spectrometry. Samples were dissolved in 200 μl of an aqueous solution of 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% HCOOH. Ion spray mass spectra were recorded on a simple quadrupole mass spectrometer API I (Perkin-Elmer), equipped with an ion spray (nebulized-assisted electrospray) source (Sciex, Toronto, Canada). The solutions were continuously infused with a medical infusion pump (model 11, Harward Apparatus, South Natick, MA) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Polypropyleneglycol was used to calibrate the quadrupole. Ion spray mass spectra were acquired at unit resolution by scanning from m/z 400 to 1200 with a step size of 0.1 Da and a dwell time of 2 min. Ten spectra were summed. The potential of the spray needle was held at +4.5 kV. Spectra were recorded at an orifice voltage of +90 V. A Mac Bio Spec computer program was used to measure the molecular masses of the protein samples. Protein alignments were done using the method of Lipman and Pearson (30Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2554) Google Scholar). The x-ray diffraction patterns were obtained from samples of nuclei or fibrous complexes (reconstituted complexes). In both instances, samples were sealed in capillaries containing a drop of a saturated salt solution used as a control of the relative humidity. The patterns were recorded with nickel-filtered copper radiation on Kodak film. Either a modified Philips microcamera or a Statton camera (W. R. Warhus, Wilmington, DE) was used. Complexes of M. brandaris protamines with DNA were prepared by mixing both components in a proportion to achieve complete charge neutralization. The mixing buffer used was 2 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA. Mixtures were sequentially dialyzed against solutions of 2, 1, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, followed by extensive dialysis against 1 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmEDTA. Complexes started to precipitate when the guanidine hydrochloride concentration was about 0.8 m. The fibrous precipitates were then pulled with tweezers and allowed to dry under tension in order to yield fibers suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis (31Fornells M. Campos J.L. Subirana J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,32Fita I. Campos J.L. Puigjaner L.C. Subirana J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 157-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy analysis was performed as described previously (18Càceres C. Ribes E. Muller S. Cornudella L. Chiva M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 38: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Either gonadal tissue or sperm cell sediments were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 mcacodylate buffer and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer. The samples were next dehydrated and soaked in Spurr's resin. Sample sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined under a Hitachi H-600 transmission electron microscope. Sperm cells ofM. brandaris contain electrodense cylindrical nuclei grooved by axonemes (Fig. 1, inset). Acid extraction of purified nuclei with 0.4 n HCl yielded three basic proteins (Fig. 1, lane w). Previous chemical reduction of chromatin prior to extraction did not solubilize any additional proteins. Nucleoprotein components were purified by reverse-phase HPLC eluting in the order P3 → P2 → P1 (Fig. 1). Protamine P1 (peak 3 and lane 3 in Fig. 1) was repurified by reverse-phase HPLC in the same conditions to eliminate a small amount of contaminating P2 protamine. The amino acid analysis of M. brandaris protamines revealed a set of simple molecules of very basic nature (Table I). P1 is made up of six different aminoacyl types, P2 by only four types, whereas P3 appears to be the simplest protamine known to date, involving just three amino acid residues (Arg, Lys, and Gly). Arginine, lysine, and glycine are the major components of all three protamines (94.9% in P1, 96.7% in P2, and 100% in P3). Another relevant feature revealed by the amino acid analyses was the low proportion of phosphorylatable residues in all of the molecules (2% in P1, 3.2% in P2, and 0% in P3). This is a striking fact if it is considered that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes regulate the interactions with DNA in vertebrate protamines. All protamines were repeatedly analyzed by automated Edman degradation with consistent results. Due to the yields and purity of the protein samples together with the powerful methodology employed, it was possible to obtain complete and unambiguous sequences in single sequencing runs (Fig.2C).Table IAmino acid composition of M. brandaris protamines P1, P2, and P3P1P2P3abcabcabcmol %mol %mol %mol %mol %mol %Lys34.424.82537.121.52138.220.621Arg34.024.52436.521.22136.319.619Ser2.01.413.21.92Gly26.519.11923.113.41425.313.614Ala1.10.81Cys1.91.42Total residues725854Shown are the mol % determined from the compositional analysis (a), corresponding residue contents (b), and number of residues derived from the amino acid sequence (c). Open table in a new tab Shown are the mol % determined from the compositional analysis (a), corresponding residue contents (b), and number of residues derived from the amino acid sequence (c). Molecular masses of protamines P1, P2, and P3 as established by ion spray mass spectrometry were 8416 ± 1 Da, 6962 Da, and 6474 Da, respectively (Fig. 2 A). The molecular mass of protamine P1 was also determined in mature gonads containing partially ripe spermatozoa (Fig. 2 B). In this case, a molecular mass of 8497 Da was obtained for a fraction of the protamine, consistent with the phosphorylated form (8417 + 80 Da). This result suggests that protamine P1 is monophosphorylated in the stages preceding full ripening of the sperm and is coincident with the presence of only one serine residue in the P1 molecule. The analytical results so far reported are wholly congruent. First, the molecular masses derived from the amino acid analyses (P1, 8415 Da; P2, 6960 Da; P3, 6473 Da) are totally coincident with the masses determined. Second, the number of amino acid residues obtained from the compositional analyses is practically identical to that afforded by the primary structures (see Table I). It is relevant to note the simplicity of the M. brandaris protamine sequences whose organization will be dealt with later. Protamine P3 appears exclusively constituted of Arg, Lys, and Gly amino acids, while both P1 and P2 contain a few additional residues. This structural simplicity together with the low proportion of phosphorylatable residues (only three serines out of 184 amino acid residues) contrasts with the elaborated forms of spermiogenic chromatin condensation illustrated in Fig. 3. We have previously shown that unripe spermiogenic nuclei of M. brandaris contain a substantial number of proteins with an electrophoretic mobility intermediate between histones and protamines in denaturing polyacrylamide gels (18Càceres C. Ribes E. Muller S. Cornudella L. Chiva M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 38: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This abundant subset of intermediate proteins disappears in very advanced stages of spermiogenesis and becomes wholly absent from ripe sperm nuclei. Considering both the electrophoretic behavior and amino acid composition of these intermediate proteins, we surmised that they might direct the complex transitions in the condensation of the M. brandaris spermiogenic chromatin, modulating the interaction with DNA through a series of posttranslational intranuclear modifications and acting as precursors of the ripe sperm protamines. In order to verify the preceding assertion these proteins were analyzed in detail. First, the largest intermediate molecule Pr-P1, displaying the slowest electrophoretic mobility, was purified, and the sequence of its N terminus comprising the initial 52 amino acid residues was determined by automated Edman degradation together with the assessment of its molecular mass by ion spray mass spectrometry (Fig.4). Moreover, purified Pr-P1 protein reacted positively with anti-protamine P1 antisera (Fig.5, lane e). TableII shows the actual amino acid composition of the putative precursor molecule and its comparison with the composition estimated under the assumption that the molecule is a true precursor of protamine P1. The results indicate that this intermediate protein (Pr-P1) indeed corresponds to a monophosphorylated precursor of protamine P1. Thus, the molecular mass of the monophosphorylated form of protamine P1 (8497 Da in Fig. 2) plus that corresponding to the 35 initial residues of the N terminus of Pr-P1 yielded a value (12,657 Da) almost identical to the molecular mass of Pr-P1 obtained by ion spray mass spectrometry (12,662 Da). In addition, the determined amino acid composition is very similar to the composition estimated (Table II). Finally, the last 17 sequenced residues of Pr-P1 are identical to the 17 initial amino acid residues of P1. The presence of an alanine in position 48 of Pr-P1 confirms that this molecule truly encompasses protamine P1, since both P2 and P3 lack the former residue.Figure 5Immunoreactivity of protein Pr-P1 to anti-P1 antisera.

Open table in a new tab Shown are the amino acid composition (mol %) determined for protein Pr-P1 (a) and estimated composition considering Pr-P1 a direct precursor form of protamine P1 (b). It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the anti-protamine P1 antiserum reacts positively with the bulk of intermediate proteins present in spermiogenic nuclei (see lane b). This result suggests that these proteins do contain also the protamine P1 sequence and therefore can be considered precursor molecules. To confirm this assumption, the material under the individual peaks in Fig.4 A was subfractionated by HPLC, and the resulting proteins were directly sequenced by automated Edman degradation. In some cases, protein yields allowed for additional determinations of the molecular mass by ion spray mass spectrometry (TableIII). The sequences obtained (Fig.6) clearly show that the intermediate proteins analyzed arise from the gradual trimming of the N-terminal residues of protein Pr-P1. Moreover, the molecular weights determined (Table III) indicate that these molecules are monophosphorylated. Nine major precursor forms have been identified; however, the presence of additional minor components cannot be discounted. These results show that the M. brandaris Pr-P1 precursor is processed by means of serial deletions each involving one or a few more amino acid residues. Although this processing mechanism is not common to other molluscs (33Wouters-Tyrou D. Martin-Ponthieu A. Ledoux-Andula N. Kouach M. Jaquinod M. Subirana J.A. Sautière P. Biochem.

To determine the capacity of M. brandarisprotamines to compact DNA, protamine-DNA complexes were subjected to x-ray diffraction analysis. Two sets of experiments were carried out. In the first series, x-ray diffraction patterns were obtained from purified sperm nuclei, whereas in the second the analyses were performed with reconstituted complexes of DNA with purified M. brandaris protamines (see “Materials and Methods”). Nuclei or reconstituted complexes were analyzed at different values of relative humidity. Fig. 7 shows the x-ray diffraction patterns obtained from reconstituted complexes at 76% relative humidity (Fig. 7 A) and from sperm nuclei at 92% relative humidity (Fig. 7 B). The complex in Fig.7 A may be interpreted as a B form of DNA packed in an orthorhombic lattice with two molecules per unit cell, with approximate cell parameters as follows: a = 33.2 Å,b = 24.1 Å, and c = 33.4 Å. The values reported in Table IV show that distances between DNA strands observed in reconstituted complexes and sperm nuclei are highly coincident at each value of relative humidity.Table IVDNA packing by M. brandaris protaminesRelative humidityabÅÅ3319.519.35419.519.47620.520.19222.822.8Shown are the distances between neighbor DNA strands of the x-ray diffraction patterns obtained from nuclei (a) and reconstituted (M. brandaris protamine-DNA) complexes (b) at different values of relative humidity. Open table in a new tab Shown are the distances between neighbor DNA strands of the x-ray diffraction patterns obtained from nuclei (a) and reconstituted (M. brandaris protamine-DNA) complexes (b) at different values of relative humidity. These experiments show that DNA becomes packaged by M. brandaris protamines in a very tight and compact manner as deduced from the distance between axes of the neighbor DNA strands, which varies between 19.5 and 22.8 Å (see Table IV). These values are similar to those found in squid nucleoprotamine, which contains 79% arginine (36Suau P. Subirana J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 909-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is likely that the charge distribution and large percentage of glycine (an amino acid with a minimal volume) in the protamines of M. brandaris generate a compactness of the DNA to such extremes that the resulting volume of the mature sperm nucleus becomes comparable with that of the DNA alone when considered as a cylinder of 20 Å in diameter. Three protamines of a very simple composition (P1, P2, and P3) are present in the ripe sperm nuclei of the mollusc M. brandaris. One of them (P3) is the simplest protamine known to date, being made up of only three types of amino acids (Gly, Lys, and Arg) and completely lacking phosphorylatable residues. The most relevant features of these three molecules are their extreme basicity and the presence of arginine clusters interspersed with very rich GK tracts. Arginine clusters have been held responsible for the cooperative interaction of protamines with DNA (37Willmitzer L. Wagner R.G. Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1980; 6: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but GK-rich regions are absent in other known protamines. Among the M. brandaris protamines, the GK-alternating residues are particularly evident near the N terminus of protamine P1 (see residues 8–22 in Fig.2). It is worth indicating that some other protamines contain substantial clusters of alternating basic/nonbasic residues close to their N termini, notably the (RS)n repeat (5Oliva R. Dixon G.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. and Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 25-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 45Daban M. Martinage A. Kouach M. Chiva M. Subirana J.A. Sautière P. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a (RS)n motif adjacent to a tract of basic amino acid residues has been observed in some splicing factors, having been implicated in intranuclear location (38Hedley M.L. Amrein H. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11524-11528Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The repeating GK dipeptide might also represent a novel protamine-DNA element, although further structural studies are required to unambiguously establish its specific role in the highly efficient and organized packaging of DNA in the sperm chromatin. In addition to the amino acids Arg, Lys, and Gly, protamine P1 also contains a phosphorylatable residue of serine, one alanine and two cysteine residues. The high content of cysteine usually found in protamines from mammals and some other species is thought to stabilize the nuclear structure of sperm by intermolecular disulfide bridging (39Balhorn R. Corzett M. Mazrimas J. Watkins B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 40Balhorn R. Adolph K.W. Molecular Biology of Chromosome Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1982: 366-420Google Scholar). This notwithstanding, the fact that protamine P1 fromM. brandaris can be extracted from nuclei with no need of previous chemical reduction of the sperm chromatin strongly supports the notion that the cysteine residues present in this protein do not form intermolecular covalent linkages. The compositional and structural simplicity of the M. brandaris protamines suggests that these molecules have acquired a defined specialization to perform a tight and compact packaging of DNA (Table IV). It has been established in the present work that protamine P1 fromM. brandaris appears as a precursor molecule in the spermiogenic nuclei encompassing the mature protamine in a phosphorylated form preceded by an N-terminal precursor peptide. The precursor sequence is made up of 35 amino acid residues of which nine are basic (five Arg, three Lys, one His) and seven are acidic (two Asp and five Glu, four of them in a row, Glu4). The presence of basic and acidic residues allows the peptide to interact with both DNA and basic proteins (histones or protamines). It is noticeable that nucleoplasmin, a protein specialized in remodeling chromatin structure during fertilization, also interacts with histones or protamines by means of its clusters of acidic residues (41Dilworth S.M. Black S.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 1009-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 42Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Philpott A. Leno G.H. Dilworth S.M. Dinwall C. Philos. Trans. R.

The successive deletions of the precursor peptide (see Fig. 6) might modulate the interactions of the proteins with DNA and might also be instrumental in the structural transitions undergone by the spermiogenic chromatin (see Fig. 3). Likewise, the dephosphorylation observed may have a significant role, although most probably restricted to the final step of chromatin condensation (coalescence of lamellae). The protamine P1 precursor contains a single serine residue in the sequence. The latter residue appears phosphorylated throughout the processing of the molecule (see Table III), undergoing dephosphorylation only in the fully ripe spermiogenic nuclei. Finally, the analysis of the internal repeats in M. brandaris protamines (Fig. 8) suggests a particular evolution for these proteins, which may have arisen from ancestral peptides having undergone a Lys4indel (insertion or deletion) together with some duplications. Ancestral peptides might be represented by R6(GK)8 tracts in protamine P1 and R6(GK)3K4(GK)5stretches in protamines P2 and P3, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2085103291,"CD59 is a complement regulatory protein and may also act as a signal-transducing molecule. CD59 transgenic mice have been generated using a CD59 minigene (CD59 minigene-1). Although this minigene contained a 4.6-kilobase pair 5'-flanking region from the human CD59 gene as a promoter, the expression levels of the CD59 mRNA were substantially lower than those observed in humans, suggesting that CD59 gene expression might also require other transcriptional regulatory elements such as an enhancer. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of the CD59 gene, we used three cell lines that express CD59 at different levels. We have identified DNase I-hypersensitive sites in intron 1 in HeLa cells, which express CD59 at high levels, but not in Jurkat (intermediate level) or Raji cells (low level). Furthermore, cell line-specific enhancer activity was detected in a fragment containing these DNase I-hypersensitive sites. The CD59 enhancer was mapped to between -1155 and -888 upstream of the 5'-end of exon 2. To investigate the enhancer activity in vivo, a new CD59 minigene was constructed by the addition of the enhancer fragment into CD59 minigene-1. High expressor CD59 transgenic mice were generated using the new minigene."
https://openalex.org/W1913954300,"We used glucocorticoid-resistant and -sensitive hepatoma cell variants to characterize the mechanism of hepatoma cell resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids. BDS1 hepatoma cells express transcriptionally active glucocorticoid receptors and undergo a stringent G1 cell cycle arrest in response to glucocorticoids that is dependent on the induced expression of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) transcription factor. In contrast, EDR1 hepatoma cells, which express normal levels of glucocorticoid receptors, fail to growth arrest or express C/EBPalpha when treated with glucocorticoids. Ectopic expression of wild-type rat glucocorticoid receptors into EDR1 cells restored the growth suppression response, suggesting a defect in the EDR1 receptor. DNA sequence analysis revealed a single point mutation causing a cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution at amino acid position 457 (C457Y-GR) in the zinc finger region of the glucocorticoid receptor that mediates both receptor-DNA and receptor-protein interactions. Glucocorticoid activation of the alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) promoter, a liver acute-phase response gene, requires receptor-DNA binding as well as an interaction with C/EBPalpha. In contrast to the wild-type glucocorticoid receptor, ectopic expression of C/EBPalpha in EDR1 cells, or coexpression of C/EBPalpha along with the C457Y-GR into receptor-deficient EDR3 cells was required to partially restore glucocorticoid responsiveness of the AGP promoter by the EDR1 glucocorticoid receptor. Constitutive expression of the wild-type glucocorticoid receptor, but not the C457Y-GR mutant, was sufficient to restore the glucocorticoid growth suppression response to receptor-deficient EDR3 cells. Thus, we have identified a glucocorticoid-resistant hepatoma cell variant with a single point mutation in the zinc finger region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene that ablates the glucocorticoid growth suppression response and attenuates transcriptional activation of the AGP promoter."

F0F1-ATP synthases are the purveyors of ATP in chloroplasts, mitochondria and bacteria. They are bound to energy-transducing membranes and couple the synthesis of ATP (through photophosphorylation of ADP) to the dissipation of a protonmotive force (1Mitchell P. Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar, 2Boyer P.D. Cross R.L. Momsen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2837-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The enzyme consists of two discrete parts, F0 and F1, interconnected by a stalk. F0 is embedded in the membrane and behaves as a proton channel. The extrinsic part F1 bears the six nucleotide binding sites; three of them are catalytic sites for ATP synthesis (for a review, see Ref. 3Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Depending on species, three or more different subunits compose the F0 moiety: a(1), b(2), and c(9–12) in Escherichia coli; a(1), b(1), b′(1), and c(9–12) in chloroplasts. In mitochondria, the F0 moiety bears additional subunits (4Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The F1 part consists of five different subunits: α, β, γ, δ, and ε, with α(3), β(3), γ(1), δ(1), ε(1) as stoichiometry. It is proposed that the ATP synthase acts as a proton-driven motor (5Vik S.B.

The rotation relayed by γ would sequentially modify the three-dimensional structure of the three catalytic sites (10Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

As an essential breakthrough, this model strictly correlates the cooperative mechanism of the enzyme to the rotation of the γ-subunit and thus to the proton gradient dissipation.

Mikrobiol. 1983; 23: 503-511Crossref Google Scholar), which induces chlorosis of many sensitive higher plants (18Durbin R.D. Uchytil T.F. Phytopathology. 1977; 67: 602-603Crossref Google Scholar). Chlorosis seems to be a consequence of the inhibition of photophosphorylation. TTX indeed specifically inhibits ATP synthesis in chloroplasts of sensitive species (19Steele J.A. Uchytil T.F. Durbin R.D. Bhatnagar P.K. Rich D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2245-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) as well as ATP hydrolysis in isolated CF1 (20Steele J.A. Durbin R.D. Uchytil T.F. Rich D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 501: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, TTX was shown to bind the extrinsic part F1 of the F0F1-ATP synthase (19Steele J.A. Uchytil T.F. Durbin R.D. Bhatnagar P.K. Rich D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2245-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of this toxin is its dual effect:in vitro and at low concentrations (10−8 to 10−7m), TTX inhibits ATP hydrolysis and synthesis either in isolated chloroplasts or in isolated CF1, while at high concentrations (10−5 to 10−4m) it strongly stimulates ATPase activity of the isolated enzyme (21Steele J.A. Uchytil T.F. Durbin R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 504: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and leads to a partial recovery of the coupled activity of membrane-bound ATP synthase (22Sigalat C. Pitard B. Haraux F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The mechanism of TTX action, for the inhibition as well as for the reactivation, is still unknown. The number of binding sites involved in the reactivating effect remains controversial. It has been reported that CF1 binds two molecules of TTX on distinct sites (23Pinet E. Gomis J.-M. Girault G. Cavelier F. Verducci J. Noël J.-P. André F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) presumably located on β-subunit, although this point remains obscure (24Avni A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since the affinity of TTX for these two binding sites was found different, we suggested that they were respectively related to the inhibitory and stimulatory activities of TTX (23Pinet E. Gomis J.-M. Girault G. Cavelier F. Verducci J. Noël J.-P. André F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Also, Mochimaru and Sakurai (27Mochimaru M. Sakurai H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have recently suggested the existence of a third very low affinity binding site, which would account for the reactivation process. The affinity of TTX for the inhibitory site has been measured in various forms of the ATP synthase (20Steele J.A. Durbin R.D. Uchytil T.F. Rich D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 501: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Hu N. Mills D.A. Huchzermeyer B. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8536-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with limited efforts to relate it to the functional states of the enzyme (27Mochimaru M. Sakurai H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Rare investigations have been carried out on the interactions between the nucleotide binding sites and the TTX binding sites. TTX at inhibiting concentration does not interfere with the exchange of tightly bound nucleotide (29Fromme P. Dahse I. Gräber P. Z. Naturforsch. 1992; 47c: 239-244Google Scholar), while it seems to promote the ADP release at high concentrations (30Reimer S. Selman B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7249-7255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the effect of the presence of nucleotides and, more generally, of the catalytic state of the enzyme on TTX binding to its low affinity site has never been studied. In this report, we show strong evidence for the existence of only two TTX binding sites on chloroplast ATP synthase in the concentration range of in vitro assays, and we show that they directly account for the inhibitory and reactivating effects of TTX on the activity of CF1 and CF1-ε. In addition, thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of TTX binding on the inhibitory site were thoroughly determined. No influence of the dynamic state of the enzyme on this inhibitory binding has been observed. As regards the reactivation process, kinetic experiments revealed the existence of two new dynamic forms of CF1-ε related to the presence of ATP: a transient overactivated state and a dead end complex unable to bind a second TTX molecule. We show that TTX binding to its reactivating site is strongly dependent on the presence of nucleotide on the enzyme. We propose a kinetic model that accounts for all of our results, of which most of the constants were determined. The soluble chloroplast ATPase (CF1) was extracted and purified from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves in the active form devoid of its inhibitory subunit ε, unless specified. The enzyme was stored at 5 °C in 34% ammonium sulfate buffer as described previously (31Berger G. Girault G. André F. Galmiche J.-M. J. Liquid Chromatogr. 1987; 10: 1507-1517Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) at a protein concentration of 16 mg ml−1. CF1-ε was activated by preincubation at 20 °C in 20 mm Tricine, pH 8, 3 mm DTT for at least 3 h. When CF1 was used, no activation was performed. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption spectroscopy assuming for CF1-ε an extinction coefficient of 0.48 cm2mg−1 at 278 nm (31Berger G. Girault G. André F. Galmiche J.-M. J. Liquid Chromatogr. 1987; 10: 1507-1517Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Samples of 500 μl of DTT-activated CF1-ε at various concentrations (10 nm to 10 μm) were dialyzed in SPECTRA/POR tubing (molecular weight cut-off = 6000–8000) for 24 h at 37 °C against 50 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8, buffer containing various concentrations of 14C-TTX (ranging from 10 nmto 10 μm). 14C-TTX was obtained as described previously (23Pinet E. Gomis J.-M. Girault G. Cavelier F. Verducci J. Noël J.-P. André F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with a specific activity of 52 Ci mol−1. Equilibrium conditions were checked by measuring in small aliquots the inner and outer radioactivity at four different times during dialysis. Each counting was performed twice for 4 min using a Beckman LS 3801 Scintillation Counter. 14C cpm ranged from 500 ± 60 to 5 × 105 ± 200. Free TTX concentration was deduced from the radioactivity measured outside the dialysis tubing, and bound TTX concentration was calculated from the difference between the radioactivity measured inside and outside the dialysis tubing. No significant loss of activity occurred within 24 h in these experimental conditions. For TTX concentrations higher than 10 μm, 14C-TTX and CF1-ε were first equilibrated for 3 h at 37 °C. Bound and free TTX were then rapidly separated using a PD 10 Amersham Pharmacia Biotech chromatography column, and their concentrations were measured as indicated above. Binding curve was fitted using Microcal ORIGIN 5.0 (Microcal Software). 500-μl samples of 14C-TTX at various concentrations were dialyzed at 37 °C in a low cut-off (M r = 1000) SPECTRA/POR dialysis tubing against 20 ml of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8, 40 mm KHCO3, 0.18 mmMgSO4). Small aliquots were withdrawn from the outer buffer at different times, and the radioactivity was measured as described above and converted into TTX concentration. The volume of the dialysis tube, and thus the exchange surface, was nearly constant in each experiment. The outer TTX concentration was plotted as a function of time and fitted to Fick's law using Microcal ORIGIN 5.0. Control experiments were performed with 500 μm samples of ADP, diadenosine 5′-hexaphosphate, and Alcyan Blue, titrated by spectrophotometry. DTT-activated CF1-ε (10 nm) was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8, buffer, in the presence of TTX at various concentrations for 4 h up to 12 h for the lowest concentrations. 5 min after the addition of 40 mmKHCO3 and 0.18 mm MgSO4, ATP hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of ATP (final concentration 1 mm). The reaction mixture was thermostatted at 37 °C, and aliquots of 10 μl were taken every 3.5 min (up to 15 min) and injected into a TSK DEAE 2SW 5-μm analytical high pressure liquid chromatography column for nucleotide determination. The nucleotides were separated by isocratic elution with 0.1 mKH2PO4, pH 4.3, 0.25 m NaCl, at a rate of 1.0 ml min−1. ADP concentration was determined from the area of the peak detected at 260 nm. The ATPase activities of CF1-ε in the presence of various concentrations of TTX were deduced from the plots of ADP concentration as a function of time and normalized to the control activity without TTX (Fig. 4). For inhibition kinetic studies, DTT-activated CF1-ε (10 nm) was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in a stirred reaction buffer in a spectrophotometer cuvette. The reaction buffer (50 mmTris-SO4, pH 8, 40 mm KHCO3, 4 mm MgSO4, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.3 mm NADH, 0.1 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase) allowed us to couple ATP hydrolysis to NADH oxidation. The time response of this system, checked by ADP addition in the absence of TTX, was always significantly shorter than a few seconds. ATP hydrolysis was started by adding MgATP (final concentration 2 mm) and monitored by absorbance decrease at 340 nm. In a first series of experiments (Fig. 3 a), TTX was added at various inhibitory concentrations (from 5 nm to 5 μm) 3 min after the addition of MgATP. In another series of experiments (Fig. 3 b), MgATP was added after the incubation of CF1-ε for various times with 75 nm TTX. The resulting kinetics were fitted to Equation4. For reactivation kinetic studies, DTT-activated CF1-ε (10 nm) was incubated either in the presence or in the absence of inhibitory concentration of TTX (500 nm). ATP hydrolysis was started by the addition of MgATP (final concentration 2 mm) and continuously monitored at 340 nm. In a first series of experiments, TTX was added at various reactivating concentrations (from 5 to 150 μm) to inhibited CF1-ε, 3 min after the addition of MgATP (Fig. 6 a). Similar experiments were achieved by adding MgATP after the addition of reactivating concentrations of TTX (Fig. 6 b). The decay phases of the kinetics of Fig. 6, a and b, were fitted to a primitive function of Equation 14. The resulting apparent rate constants k app were fitted to Equation 13, which allowed the determination of k +,k −, and K. Other protocols are detailed in the text. Fig. 1 shows the amount of 14C-TTX bound to CF1-ε, when equilibrated at 37 °C, as a function of the concentration of free14C-TTX. The data were fitted to a model based on multiple independent binding sites. The fit clearly shows the existence of two binding sites of different affinities (K d1 = 50 ± 20 nm; K d2 = 80 ± 20 μm) in the concentration range investigated (between 10 nm and 1.2 mm). The two dissociation constants differ by about 3 orders of magnitude, and the binding of TTX to CF1-ε can therefore be considered to occur in a sequential mode. To validate the present analyses, which imply that TTX is monomeric in the reaction medium, we examined its rate of diffusion through a dialysis membrane of appropriate cut-off (see “Experimental Procedures”), at different concentrations. This diffusion indeed is expected to follow Fick's law only if molecules do not form concentration-dependent aggregates. Fig.2 (inset) shows exponential kinetics of diffusion of 14C-TTX, as expected from Fick's law. The kinetic data, normalized to the equilibrium concentration, were identical for each initial concentration inside the dialysis tube between 1.8 and 500 μm. The initial rate of diffusion of14C-TTX was thus found proportional to its internal concentration (Fig. 2, main panel). To check the dialysis membrane cut-off, we controlled the rate of diffusion of several molecules of different molecular masses, at internal concentrations of 500 μm. Their initial rates of diffusion were determined and plotted as a function of their concentration in Fig. 2. ADP (M r = 427) diffused at the same rate as TTX (M r = 414.5). Conversely, diadenosine 5′-hexaphosphate (M r = 996) diffused at a 4-fold lower rate and Alcyan Blue (M r = 1299) did not diffuse at all. This shows that TTX does behave as a monomer, even at 500 μm. This implies that the reactivation of CF1-ε by high TTX concentrations (Figs. 5 and 6) is not due to some artifact and should be interpreted as the specific binding of a second TTX molecule on its low affinity site.Figure 5Kinetics of ATPase reactivation for different incubation times with ATP. Conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” CF1-ε (10 nm) was inhibited by 500 nm TTX and incubated for various times (9 s (1), 30 s (2), 60 s (3), 120 s (4), and 300 s (5)) with 2 mm MgATP. ATP hydrolysis was monitored after a 20 μm TTX addition. Instantaneous rates were obtained from the first derivative of ATP hydrolysis profiles. They were normalized to the control without TTX (6 ± 1 μmol of ATP/min/mg).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rate of inhibition by TTX was investigated by injecting TTX to a solution of CF1-ε during ATP hydrolysis, continuously monitored by ADP-dependent NADH oxidation. Typical recordings of absorbance at 340 nm are displayed in the inset of Fig.3 a. The absorbance followed a single exponential decrease superimposed to a linear decay. Therefore, the experimental data were satisfactorily fitted to Equation 4. The apparent rate constant k app of the exponential kinetics of inhibition was derived for each TTX concentration. As expected from a unique binding site model, k app was found to depend linearly on TTX concentration (Fig. 3 a). According to Equation 3, the slope of the straight line gives the forward rate constant k on of the binding of TTX to the inhibitory site. The value of k on at 37 °C was found to be 4.7 × 104m−1 s−1, i.e. 7 times higher than the value estimated by Mochimaru and Sakurai (27Mochimaru M. Sakurai H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) by experiments at room temperature. The rate of binding of TTX on the inhibitory site was also measured in the absence of ATP. CF1-ε was incubated in presence of 75 nm TTX for various times. Then ATP was added, the corresponding kinetics were recorded (Fig. 3 b,inset), and the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined. This rate was plotted as a function of the time of incubation with TTX (Fig. 3 b). The kinetics of inhibition so obtained were fitted with a monoexponential function (Equation 2). Taking into account the TTX concentration and assuming that thek off is negligible, the derivedk app gave rise to a forward rate constantk on of 6 × 104m−1 s−1. This value is close to that determined above in the presence of ATP. Since the rate constantk on of TTX for the inhibitory site is not very high, long times of incubations are required to observe the full effect of low concentrations of TTX (below 100 nm), even at 37 °C. For this reason, we investigated the inhibitory effect of low concentrations of TTX under conditions similar to those previously reported (32Santolini J. Haraux F. Munier L. Sigalat C. André F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3343-3350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), except that the time of incubation with TTX was raised in order to reach the binding equilibrium (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results are displayed in Fig.4 a. The data points were fitted to Equations 6 and 7, giving a K d for the inhibitory site of about 8 nm. This K dis lower than that previously determined (38 nm) for shorter incubation times (32Santolini J. Haraux F. Munier L. Sigalat C. André F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3343-3350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The resulting value of the rate constant of dissociation k off is 3.7 × 10−4 s−1. This value confirms thatk off was negligible with respect tok on[T] above. The same protocol was used to investigate the effect of TTX on ATPase activity of native CF1 for concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 1 mm (Fig. 4 b). The affinity of TTX for the inhibitory site of CF1(K d = 13 nm) was found almost identical to the one determined for CF1-ε. The lack of the ε-subunit and the DTT activation have no effect on the inhibition processes of TTX. Since the solubility of TTX is limited to 3.5 mm and the monomeric state of TTX is uncertain above 1 mm, the investigation of its effect on CF1above 1 mm would be of little interest. Therefore, we only measured the reactivation of the ATPase for TTX concentrations up to 1 mm. Since no plateau of CF1 activity was reached, we were not able to precisely determine the dissociation constant for the second, loose site. Whatever it may be, theK d varied from 700 μm to 2.7 mm for a reactivation level set from 5- to 20-fold the control. As a result, the binding of a second TTX molecule appears quite different between CF1 and CF1-ε. We have investigated the kinetics of reactivation of CF1-ε by TTX. The enzyme was introduced in the spectrophotometric cuvette with TTX at 500 nm to fill the inhibitory site and in the presence of an enzymatic system coupled to NADH oxidation. In order to check the effect of nucleotides on the TTX-dependent reactivation process, the enzyme was incubated with ATP for various times (from 2 s to 10 min) before the addition of a reactivating concentration of TTX. As expected, the ATPase was inhibited by 500 nm of TTX (6–7% of the control). Reactivation was then initiated by adding 20 μm of TTX (Fig.5). Surprisingly, a biphasic profile was observed for short preincubation time with ATP. It consisted of a fast rise followed by a slow monoexponential decay. This behavior progressively disappeared with increasing ATP incubation time to finally give rise to a simple monophasic reactivation. TTX-inhibited CF1-ε was incubated with ATP during 3 min (conditions leading to a monophasic profile of reactivation; Fig. 5), and high concentrations of TTX (5–150 μm) were then added. A progressive recovery of ATPase activity was observed. The kinetics of recovery of activity could be satisfactorily fitted to a monoexponential function (Fig.6 a). Surprisingly, the rate constant k app was not a linear function of the TTX concentration. It was even found to decrease with TTX concentration (Fig. 6 c). This behavior is not that expected from reactivation kinetically controlled by TTX binding on the low affinity site. We also checked the kinetics of reactivation obtained at different TTX concentrations, added together with ATP (Fig. 6 b). The kinetics were this time clearly biphasic; the activity passed through a transient overactivation and then decayed to a plateau similar to the one obtained with long ATP preincubation (Fig. 6 a). We did not try to analyze the fast rising phase, because its kinetic resolution was not good enough. However, the slow phase has been fitted to a monoexponential function. Contrary to what has been calculated in the kinetic analysis of Fig.6 a, the rate constant k app was here independent of TTX concentration (Fig. 6 c). Identical results were obtained when reactivating TTX was added to inhibited CF1-ε at different times before ATP (data not shown). In other experiments, the kinetics of ATPase reactivation were investigated as in Fig. 6 by adding high concentrations of TTX, but directly to the active, noninhibited enzyme. The kinetics of reactivation also followed the biphasic mode already observed in Fig.6 b. Contrary to what was observed in the previous experiments, preincubation with ATP several minutes before TTX addition did not change the kinetics of activation (data not shown). From these experiments, two different modes of reactivation can be discriminated on a kinetic basis. The first one, observed when TTX is added several minutes after ATP (Fig. 6 a), is a monophasic rise of activity toward an equilibrium value. The second one is observed when ATP is added after or with TTX (Fig. 6 b). It consists of a fast rise of activity followed by a slow monoexponential decay, leading to about the same equilibrium level as the first mode. Another major difference between these two modes of reactivation is the characteristic evolution of k app as a function of TTX concentration. We have also observed that the release of TTX from the reactivatory site was very fast in the presence of ATP. CF1-ε was first incubated with TTX 50 μm at room temperature, for 10 min (a sufficient time for TTX to bind on the two sites), in the presence as well as in the absence of ATP. Then the sample was quickly 100-fold diluted in the reaction medium containing ATP, which keeps the high affinity site filled, and the ATPase reaction was immediately monitored by NADH spectrophotometry. Since no significant activity could be detected (data not shown), we concluded that in the presence of ATP, TTX is released from the low affinity site in a time shorter than the detection time (a few seconds). Two binding sites with different K d values account for the inhibitory and reactivatory effects of TTX. The K d values determined by 14C-TTX binding and kinetic experiments are compatible. They differ from those determined by Pinet et al. (23Pinet E. Gomis J.-M. Girault G. Cavelier F. Verducci J. Noël J.-P. André F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) through binding studies, probably because the conditions were critically different (buffer at 37 instead of 4 °C). We do not confirm or invalidate the existence of a third binding site of very low affinity recently proposed (27Mochimaru M. Sakurai H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, we think that it should be considered very cautiously for different reasons. This third site was indeed revealed at TTX concentrations above 2 mm"

A heritable deficiency of the acid hydrolase β-glucuronidase (β-d-glucuronide glucuronosohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.31) is responsible for the clinical manifestations of MPS type VII (Sly disease) (1Sly W.S.

Animal models share many of the abnormalities found in human MPS VII (3Haskins M.E. Desnick R.J. DiFerrante N. Jezyk P.F. Patterson D.F. Pediatr.

They have been used extensively as experimental systems to investigate pathogenesis and therapies. The basis for therapy in MPS VII and most other lysosomal storage diseases is that secreted normal enzyme can be taken up into the lysosomes of diseased cells, where it can degrade substrate (5Neufeld E.F. Fratantoni J.C. Science. 1970; 169: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This has been demonstrated in MPS VII mice by injection of recombinant enzyme (6Sands M.S. Vogler C. Kyle J.W. Grubb J.H. Levy B. Galvin N. Sly W.S. Birkenmeier E.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and by transplantation of bone marrow (7Birkenmeier E.H.

Nature. 1995; 374: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Somatic gene therapy using retrovirus vector-mediated transduction of hematopoietic stem cells followed by autologous transplantation of irradiated recipients showed that as little as 2% of normal enzyme levels could completely reverse the pathology in some major organs (10Wolfe J.H. Sands M.S. Barker J.E. Gwynn B. Rowe L.B. Vogler C.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Nature. 1992; 360: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Another strategy is autologous implantation in vector-corrected fibroblasts in neo-organs (11Moullier P. Bohl D. Heard J.M. Danos O. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This methodology has several technical advantages over stem cell transduction, including ease of harvest of autologous target cells by skin biopsy, ease of ex vivo expansion and retroviral infection, and ease of removal of the neo-organ. Some of the clinical manifestations of the disease, notably resolution of lysosomal storage lesions in the liver and spleen, were ameliorated by continuous intercellular exchange of the β-glucuronidase enzyme. The levels of normal β-glucuronidase seen were similar to those that were effective by hematopoietic stem cell transduction. However, there was no improvement in macroscopic characteristics, such as skeletal deformities. Similarly, enzyme secreted from fibroblast grafts in the brain can correct storage lesions in neural cells near the graft (12Taylor R.M. Wolfe J.H. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The efficacy of gene transfer has been limited, however, by the small number of fibroblasts transplanted and by down-regulation of vector expression (11Moullier P. Bohl D. Heard J.M. Danos O. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 12Taylor R.M. Wolfe J.H. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). One approach to overcoming these drawbacks may be to increase the level of enzyme secreted from each cell to supply more normal enzyme to the affected tissues (12Taylor R.M. Wolfe J.H. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Wolfe J.H. Kyle J.W. Sands M.S. Sly W.S. Markowitz D.G. Parente M.K. Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 70-78PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, enhancing β-glucuronidase activity by generating vectors with strong or universal genetic regulatory elements may not be a viable solution, as a number of enhancers gradually become inactivated in gene-corrected fibroblasts in vivo (12Taylor R.M. Wolfe J.H. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 14St. Louis D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, several methodologies for the selection of retrovirus vector-transduced cells have been described, utilizing bicistronic vectors that encode transcriptional fusions between a therapeutic gene and a selectable marker (16Adam M.A. Ramesh N. Miller A.D. Osborne W.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two classes of selectable marker genes have been used, including those encoding proteins that confer resistance to otherwise cytotoxic drugs, or surface markers that allow for selection by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). However, a number of problems associated with these surrogate markers have arisen, including reduction in the translational efficiency of the downstream gene (17Podda S. Ward M. Himelstein A.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 479-488PubMed Google Scholar), and repression of expression of the therapeutic gene due to the presence of transcriptional silencer elements in prokaryotic drug resistance encoding genes (23Artelt P. Grannemann R. Stocking C. Friel J. Bartsch J. Hauser H. Gene. 1991; 99: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The complications associated with the presence of surrogate markers might be avoided by selecting directly for expression of the therapeutic gene. Previously, we described a novel reporter assay utilizing E. coli β-glucuronidase in mammalian cells (24Lorincz M.L. Roederer M. Diwu Z. Herzenberg L.A. Nolan G.P. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 321-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the development of a FACS-based assay utilizing a fluorescein-based substrate for the detection of mammalian β-glucuronidase activity at the single cell level. This quantitative assay can be used to isolate viable cells with uniformly high β-glucuronidase activity from a population of cells showing heterogeneous levels of expression. Sorted cells can be expanded and maintain high levels of endogenous and secreted β-glucuronidase in culture. Utilizing the mouse model of MPS VII, this method was used to isolate a subpopulation of fibroblasts still expressing β-glucuronidase after in vivo subcutaneous passage in neo-organs. Ex vivo expansion and secondary transplantation of this subpopulation revealed that it was enriched for cells that stably express high levels of β-glucuronidase in vivo. We propose that this method may be a useful addition to retroviral-based gene therapy treatment of MPS VII. Murine MPS VII skin fibroblasts (3521), fibroblasts isolated from a heterozygous mouse (3522) (13Wolfe J.H. Kyle J.W. Sands M.S. Sly W.S. Markowitz D.G. Parente M.K. Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 70-78PubMed Google Scholar), and primary cultures of BL/6 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 50 nm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.05 μm streptomycin, and 2.0 mm glutamine. 3521 fibroblasts were transduced with the retroviral expression vector DCHβH (DCHβH-3521) as described previously (13Wolfe J.H. Kyle J.W. Sands M.S. Sly W.S. Markowitz D.G. Parente M.K. Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 70-78PubMed Google Scholar). The DCHβH provirus encodes the human β-glucuronidase transcription unit 5′ of the retroviral enhancer in each long terminal repeat and the neomycin resistance gene downstream of the 5′ long terminal repeat. Where indicated, transduced cells were selected by culturing in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Serum was heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 60 min to inactivate bovine β-glucuronidase. For cross-correction experiments, two-chamber, 24-mm plates with a 0.4 μm filter (Transwell, Costar) separating the upper (donor cell) from the lower (target cell) chamber were used, as described (25Taylor R.M. Wolfe J.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 105 3521 target cells resuspended in 2.5 ml of complete media and an equivalent number of donor cells resuspended in 1.5 ml of complete medium were added to the bottom and top wells of the cluster plate, respectively. After 3.5 days in culture, supernatant and cells were harvested and assayed as described below. Methylumbelliferyl-glucuronide (MUGlcu) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) fluorometric lysate assays were carried out essentially as described (25Taylor R.M. Wolfe J.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent 3521 fibroblasts were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by incubation in the presence of 0.2–0.5 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, cell suspensions were centrifuged at 400 × g, and the cell pellets were resuspended by vigorous vortexing in 200 μl 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl in H20 and frozen at −70 °C. Immediately prior to analysis, the cell homogenate was thawed, vortexed, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 3 min to remove cell debris. Fifty μl of supernatant harvested from the lower target chamber was added to an equal volume of 10 mm MUGlcu in 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 4.5). The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for various times and stopped by the addition of 150 μl of 15 mm EDTA, 300 mm glycine (pH 11.2). For analysis of freshly sorted cells, 50 μl of 6 mm MUGlcu (in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 4.8, plus 0.3% Triton X-100) was added to 50 μl of sorted cells in phosphate-buffered saline. For analysis of secreted enzyme, cell supernatant was removed and centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 ×g to remove cell debris. MUGlcu (10 mm) in 0.1m citrate buffer (pH 4.8) was added to the supernatant, and the solution was incubated as described above. The fluorescent product, 4-methylumbelliferone, was measured on a 96-well plate with a Fluoroskan II fluorescence plate reader (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA) (peak excitation at 355 nm, emission at 460 nm). A standard curve of 4-methylumbelliferone was assayed in parallel to calculate units (nmol of methylumbelliferone/h) per mg of protein for the lysate assay or per ml of supernatant. Cell protein content was measured in triplicate using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cell pellets had 0.1–0.16 mg of protein/24-mm well. Single cell suspensions were pelleted and resuspended at a concentration of 4 × 106/ml in staining medium (biotin- and flavin-deficient RPMI supplemented with 4% v/v FCS). Fifty μl of cells pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 2 mmfluorescein-di-β-d-glucuronide (FDGlcu) or pentafluorobenzoylaminofluorescein-di-β-d-glucuronide (PFBFDGlcu) dissolved in staining medium (also equilibrated to 37 °C). After incubating for 10–90 min at 37 °C, the loading was stopped by dilution with 10 volumes of ice-cold staining medium. For inhibition studies, 3521 fibroblasts were preincubated in 5 mm 1,4-saccharolactone (Sigma) or 0.3 mmchloroquine at 37 °C for 10–30 min prior to the addition of substrate. Cells were maintained in the presence of inhibitor throughout the experiment. Cells were pelleted to remove any fluorescent product in the medium and resuspended in 300 μl of fresh staining medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide to fluorescently stain dead cells. Cells were maintained on ice throughout the FACS analyses to prevent leakage of the fluorescein product. FACS set-up, analyses, and sorting were conducted as described (24Lorincz M.L. Roederer M. Diwu Z. Herzenberg L.A. Nolan G.P. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 321-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Parks D.R. Lanier L.L. Herzenberg L.A. Weir D. Hertzenberg L. Hertzenberg L. Blackwell C. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. 4th Ed. Blackwell Scientific, Edinburgh, Scotland1986: 29.1-29.21Google Scholar). Histochemical staining with napthol AS-BI-β-d-glucuronide (Sigma) was conducted as described (25Taylor R.M. Wolfe J.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The neo-organs were prepared as described (11Moullier P. Bohl D. Heard J.M. Danos O. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, Gore-Tex fibers (a gift from W. R. Gore, Inc., Taos, NM) were coated with collagen, sterilized by UV light, and coated with 10 μg/ml recombinant fibroblast growth factor-2 (Promega). The cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and 5 × 106 cells/ml were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, 5 mm Hepes, 100 μg penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone, 1 μl (10 μg/ml) fibroblast growth factor-2 (Promega), 0.25 μl (0.8 mg/ml) epidermal growth factor (Boehringer Mannheim), and 0.5 ml (3 mg/ml) collagen in a dish with evenly separated fibers. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 5% CO2, 2 volumes of medium were added, and the incubation was continued for 2 days, by which time the neo-organ contracted into a semisolid gel. The neo-organs were transplanted subcutaneously through bilateral incisions on the back. After 4 weeks, individual neo-organ were removed, single cell suspensions were made by mincing and dispase digestion, and the explant cultures were evaluated for enzyme expression. Mammalian β-glucuronidase shows broad specificity for conjugated glucuronides, yielding d-glucuronic acid and alcohol hydrolysis products. Although the fluorogenic substrate FDGlcu (Fig. 1 A) is efficiently hydrolyzed by E. coli β-glucuronidase (24Lorincz M.L. Roederer M. Diwu Z. Herzenberg L.A. Nolan G.P. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 321-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), specific activity of the mammalian enzyme against this substrate has yet to be established. To determine whether FDGlcu is hydrolyzed by mammalian β-glucuronidase in viable cells, β-glucuronidase-negative 3521 fibroblasts or 3521 fibroblasts transduced with the β-glucuronidase double copy retrovirus vector DCHβH, which express high levels of β-glucuronidase (13Wolfe J.H. Kyle J.W. Sands M.S. Sly W.S. Markowitz D.G. Parente M.K. Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 70-78PubMed Google Scholar), were incubated in the presence of FDGlcu and analyzed by FACS. Viable DCHβH-3521 cells showed high levels of fluorescein fluorescence (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, nontransduced 3521 cells incubated in the presence of FDGlcu are not significantly more fluorescent than unstained controls. To establish that the fluorescence detected results from β-glucuronidase specific hydrolysis of the substrate, 3521 cells were incubated with the specific inhibitor 1,4-saccharolactone (27Levvy G.A. Biochem. J. 1952; 52: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) prior to the addition of FDGlcu (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of 1,4-saccharolactone, FDGlcu-loaded DCHβH-3521 cells showed fluorescence levels comparable to cells incubated in the absence of FDGlcu. These results show that β-glucuronidase is responsible for the hydrolysis of FDGlcu, and that the fluorescent product can be detected in viable cells by FACS. β-Glucuronidase has optimal activity at pH 4.8, consistent with its localization and degradative function in the acidic lysosome (28Fishman W.H. Goldman S.S. DeLellis R. Nature. 1967; 213: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To determine whether the activity detected by FACS is primarily localized in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment, 3521 and DCHβH-3521 cells were incubated in the presence of the lysosomotropic weak base, chloroquine, prior to the addition of substrate. The accumulation of chloroquine leads to an increase in endosomal/lysosomal pH (29Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar, 30Hollemans M. Elferink R.O. De Groot P.G. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 643: 143-151Google Scholar), inhibiting the activity of acid hydrolases in these organelles (31Roederer M. Bowser R. Murphy R.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,32Nolan G.P. Fiering S. Nicolas J.F. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2603-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In the presence of chloroquine, fluorescence development of FDGlcu-loaded DCHβH-3521 cells was significantly inhibited, to levels comparable to those found in nontransduced cells or in DCHβH-3521 cells incubated in the absence of FDGlcu (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that β-glucuronidase-mediated FDGlcu hydrolysis takes place primarily in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. In contrast to bulk lysate protocols, FACS-based assays measure fluorescence on a single cell basis. As a result, very small populations of phenotypically distinct cells can be detected in a heterogeneous population. To determine the sensitivity of the FACS-β-glucuronidase assay, 3521 and DCHβH-3521 cells were mixed at ratios from 1:1 to 1000:1, loaded with FDGlcu, and analyzed by FACS (Fig. 2 A). For each mixed population, the percentage of positive cells detected (G2) closely matched the predicted value (Fig. 2 B). Comparison of the median fluorescence value (MFl) also allows for the quantitative determination of the level of product associated with uncorrected mutant cells. The MFl of 3521 cells (G1) decreased from 2.1 to 0.8 as the 3521:DCHβH-3521 ratio increased from 1:1 to 100:1, and remained at 0.8 as the ratio increased to 1000:1 (Fig. 2 B). Although some component of this difference is contributed by a concomitant decrease in the number of DCHβH-3521 cells that fall in the G1 gate, the MFl of 2.2 primarily reflects the level of product internalized by the untreated mutant cells, and this figure is thus an overestimation of the true MFl of the 3521 population. Nevertheless, even at a ratio of 1:1, the majority of DCHβH-3521 cells show fluorescence values distinct from those of 3521 cells, with a MFl 7-fold greater than the latter. Most importantly, a population including 0.1% positive cells can be accurately enumerated with this method. The broad distribution of fluorescence in substrate-loaded DCHβH-3521 cells could result from heterogeneous substrate loading or from cell-to-cell differences in the levels of β-glucuronidase expression. Given the influence of the integration site (position effect variegation) on expression from the proviral long terminal repeat (33Conklin K.F. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Feinstein S.C. Ross S.R. Yamamoto K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), heterogeneity in expression levels would be expected from a population of cells comprised of a number of independent proviral integrants. To determine whether the fluorescence distribution reflects the intracellular β-glucuronidase expression level, DCHβH-3521 cells were loaded with FDGlcu, and viable cells were sorted on the basis of product fluorescence into lysis buffer for analysis using the independent MUGlcu assay (Fig.3 A). Reanalysis of sorted populations by FACS showed that the sorted fractions maintained their relative fluorescence profiles (Fig. 3 B). Lysate analysis (Fig. 3 D) of the bright sorted population (S2) showed levels of activity approximately 2-fold higher than an equivalent number of dull sorted cells (S1), a value consistent with that of the ratio of the corrected MFls of these populations. Both S1 and S2 populations had significantly higher levels of activity than nontransduced 3521 cells when measured by FACS (Fig. 3 C) and by lysate. Because dead cells were excluded during the sort, and the S1 and S2 populations show indistinguishable forward and orthogonal scatter profiles (data not shown), the differences detected in β-glucuronidase activity were not the result of differences in cell viability within the DCHβH-3521 population. Thus, the broad distribution of fluorescence detected in the transduced population reflected the predicted heterogeneity in expression levels. We next wished to study in greater detail the kinetics of substrate hydrolysis, and the retention of the product fluorescein, in viable cells. During the course of this work we generated another fluorescein based glucuronide substrate, PFBFDGlcu, which includes a PFB moiety (Fig. 1 A). We have established that PFB-based substrates react with reactive protein thiols in vitro andin vivo, 2Z. Diwa, unpublished observations. enhancing intracellular retention compared with conventional fluorescein-based substrates (35Lorincz M.L. Kerr W.G. Barranger J.A. Herzenberg L.A. Blood. 1996; 89: 3412-3420Crossref Google Scholar). Mutant 3521 fibroblasts, wild-type BL/6 fibroblasts, or a 1:1 mix of the two were loaded with FDGlcu or PFBFDGlcu for various times and analyzed by FACS (Fig.4 A). Analysis of the mixed samples reveals that both substrates yielded a bimodal fluorescence distribution at all time points. However, with increasing incubation time, resolution of the fluorescein dull (β-glucuronidase-negative) and bright (β-glucuronidase-positive) subpopulations is greater in the presence of PFBFDGlcu. The superior sensitivity of the PFB-based substrate is not due to an increase in substrate specificity, as the fluorescence distributions of the β-glucuronidase-negative samples stained with either substrate are indistinguishable. Thus, the disparity must be attributed to a difference in the intracellular retention of the fluorescent product in β-glucuronidase-positive cells, which becomes apparent only in the presence of β-glucuronidase-negative cells. In order to evaluate the relative capabilities of the two substrates to resolve the negative and positive subpopulations, the 25th and 75th percentiles were calculated for each mixed sample. These values approximate the MFls of the 3521 and BL/6 subpopulations, respectively, as there are equivalent numbers of each cell type present. By plotting these values, as well as the MFls of 3521 and BL/6 samples stained alone with each substrate, the extent of leakage of the hydrolysis product from β-glucuronidase-positive cells and uptake by β-glucuronidase-negative cells can be determined. The MFl of the negative subpopulation is clearly lower (Fig. 4 B) and that of the positive subpopulation higher (Fig. 4 C) in the PFBFDGlcu-loaded samples. However, a low level of product leakage does take place with PFBFDGlcu staining, as revealed by the reduced MFls of the BL/6 subpopulation in the mixed sample compared with the BL/6 sample stained alone. We next wished to test whether cells sorted on the basis of high β-glucuronidase enzymatic activity show heritable levels of relatively high enzymatic activity, and if so, whether these sorted cells secrete higher levels of cross-correcting enzyme than the population from which they were sorted. To generate a population of cells with relatively high levels of β-glucuronidase activity, DCHβH-3521 fibroblasts were loaded with PFBFDGlcu and gates were established such that the brightest 5% of fluorescein-positive cells were sorted (data not shown). After 30 days in log-phase culture, the selected cells and the DCHβH-3521 population from which they were sorted were reanalyzed by FACS. The sorted population maintained relatively high levels of β-glucuronidase activity, with 98% of the viable sorted cells showing fluorescence levels greater than or equal to the brightest 4% of viable DCHβH-3521 fibroblasts (Fig.5 A). The MFls of 0.49, 0.81, 2.4, and 79.0 for 3521, 3522, DCHβH-3521, and sorted DCHβH-3521 cells, respectively, were comparable with those obtained on the day of sorting. Using these β-glucuronidase deficient cells as targets for secreted enzyme, the cross-correcting enzyme in culture supernatants can be accurately measured. Cultures of 3521, 3522, DCHβH-3521, and sorted DCHβH-3521 donor fibroblasts, were established in Transwell plates that separated the donor from the target cells by a fluid but not cell permeable membrane, precluding enzyme transfer by cell-to-cell contact (25Taylor R.M.

https://openalex.org/W2080050699,"A strain of Bacillus sphaericusisolated from a local soil sample has been found to use β,β-dimethyl-dl-cysteine (dl-penicillamine) as the sole nitrogen source. Crude cell extract of the bacterium showed potent penicillamine-consuming activity only in the presence of NAD, which, however, was not used as an electron acceptor. Characterization of reaction products revealed that penicillamine was derivatized to a phosphoramide adduct with the ADP moiety of NAD, whereas the nicotinamide-ribose group was released and hydrolyzed spontaneously to ribose and nicotinamide. The phosphoramide product, ADP-penicillamine, caused potent product inhibition on the purified enzyme, and adenylate deaminase was found to be effective in converting the inhibitory product into inosine-diphosphate-penicillamine and thereby maintained the catalysis for several hours. The novel enzyme, termed as NAD:penicillamine ADP transferase, showed a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a mass of approximately 42 kDa. The native enzyme was monomeric. The enzyme showed high substrate specificity to NAD (K m = 13.0 mm) andl-penicillamine (K m = 6.5 mm); other nucleotides such as NADP, NAD(P)H, AMP, ADP, and ADP-ribose did not substitute for NAD, and l-valine,l-cysteine, l-homocysteine,l-cystine, l-leucine, andl-isoleucine did not serve as the substrate.

The novel NAD-dependent enzyme may catalyze the first step in penicillamine degradation in the strain ofB. sphaericus. Penicillamine, β,β-dimethyl-cysteine, is one of the most unusual amino acids because it is not catabolized by pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes. 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IDP, inosine-diphosphate. Although penicillamine has the obvious structural similarities to cysteine and valine, none of the enzymes that degrade Cys or Val can act on penicillamine. In fact, l-penicillamine can specifically inhibit various PLP-dependent enzymes, whose cofactor is compelled to form a thiazolidine ring and is no longer bound on the enzyme (1Heyl D. Harris S.A. Folkers K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1948; 70: 3429-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Kushinskas E.J. Horvath A. du Vigneaud V. Arch. Biochem. 1957; 68: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 3Evered D.F. Hargreaves B.M. Verjee Z.H. Biochem. J. 1969; 111: 15-16Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 4Aposhian H.V. Bradham L.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1960; 3: 38-41Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The driving force for this modification may derive from the unique structure of penicillamine, which bears a hard nucleophile (-NH2) and a soft nucleophile (-SH) on the vicinal carbons. The β,β-dimethyl group may also help orienting the amino and thiol groups to the same direction and by that promote the thiazolidine ring formation. d-Penicillamine, in contrast to thel-isomer, had been considered not to inhibit PLP-dependent enzymes (5Du Vigneaud V. Kuchinsas E.J. Horvath A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 69: 130-137Google Scholar), but later it was shown that thed-isomer also causes PLP depletion in rat (6Ueda K. Akedo H. Suda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1960; 48: 584-592Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 7Asatoor A.M. Nature. 1964; 203: 1382-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase is another class of enzyme thatd-penicillamine can specifically bind and abolish its catalytic functions (8Cuperus R.A. Muijsers A.O. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 749: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Cuperus R.A. Hoogland H. Wever R. Muijsers A.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Despite these inhibitory effects,d-penicillamine has been extensively used in the treatment of Wilson's disease (10Walshe J.M. Am. J. Med. 1956; 21: 487-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and in cases of lead poisoning (11Goldberg A. Smith J.A. Lochhead A.C. Brit. Med. J. 1963; : 1270-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The curative property is partly due to the ability ofd-penicillamine to bind copper or lead as a stable chelate that is filterable by the kidney and more importantly due to the metabolic stability by which penicillamine is not degraded until excreted in urine. In fact, penicillamine has originally been found in urine specimens of penicillin-treated patients, suggesting that the β-lactam antibiotic was not degraded beyond penicillamine (12Perry T.L. Dixon G.H. Hansen S. Nature. 1965; 206: 895-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Besides these effects on enzymes and metals, penicillamine can exert various biological effects such as decreasing chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (13Chwalinska-Sadowska H. Baum J. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), inhibiting DNA synthesis in T lymphocyte (14Lipsky P.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and inhibiting transactivation of human immunodeficiency virus , type 1 long terminal repeat (15Chandra A. Demirhan I. Arya S.K. Chandra P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mechanisms underneath these biological effects are not fully understood yet. We here report purification and characterization of a novel enzyme involved in penicillamine degradation in a strain of Bacillus sphaericus that can grow on dl-penicillamine as the sole nitrogen source. The enzyme, specifically induced when the bacterial cells were incubated with d- orl-penicillamine, used NAD and penicillamine as the sole substrates. The enzyme activity has been assayed by NAD-dependent penicillamine consumption. The enzyme was purified to the homogeneity using nucleotide affinity ligands and characterized as a 42-kDa monomeric protein. The catalysis was irreversible, and penicillamine was derivatized to the phosphoramide adduct, ADP-penicillamine (Scheme FS1). The phosphoramide product caused potent product inhibition, and a commercially available Aspergillus adenylate deaminase was effective in removing the inhibitory product. In the adenylate deaminase-coupled system, inosine-diphosphate-penicillamine (IDP-penicillamine) was identified as the deaminated form of the product. Kinetic studies on substrate binding interaction and the product inhibition by ADP-l-penicillamine suggested an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism with NAD as the first substrate to bind and ADP-l-penicillamine as the last product to be released. The enzyme, NAD:penicillamine ADP transferase, showed relaxed stereospecificity with respect to d- andl-penicillamine, and the l-isomer was a better substrate than the d-isomer. The stereochemical preference in the enzyme reaction was consistent with the observation that the cells of B. sphaericus consumed l-penicillamine more rapidly than the d-isomer. The NAD-dependent modification catalysis may be the first step in the penicillamine degradation pathway in the strain of B. sphaericus. Ultraviolet and visible spectra were measured on Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer, and molecular mass was determined by a quadrupole ion spray mass spectrometer API III (Perkin-Elmer, Canada). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as the standard (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). 1H and 31P NMR spectra were obtained at 500 and 80.9 MHz using Varian VXR-500 and VXR-200 spectrometers, respectively, with a Fourier transform accessory at ambient temperatures. Screening for penicillamine-catabolizing bacterium has been carried out by the enrichment culture on a medium containing 0.1% (w/v)dl-penicillamine, 0.5% glucose, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.1% K2HPO4, 0.1% NaCl, 0.05% MgSO4 7H2O, and 0.05% yeast extract, pH 7.5. Microorganisms were grown at 30 °C under aerobic conditions, and a bacterium has been isolated as a pale yellow colony formed on the medium containing 1.3% (w/v) agar. Enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the decrease of penicillamine (method 1) or NAD (method 2). In method 1, the reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of enzyme solution to 1 ml of the assay mixture containing 30 mml-penicillamine, 30 mm NAD, and 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Then an aliquot of 2 μl was spotted on 3MM chromatography paper (Whatmann) and developed with butanol/acetone/28% ammonium/water (10:10:5:2). Penicillamine was visualized by spraying 0.5% ninhydrin in 50% aqueous acetone, and the paper was heated at 110 °C for 10 min. The spot of penicillamine was cut out, extracted in 0.5 ml of 75% ethanol containing 0.05% (w/v) CuSO4, and determined spectrophotometrically at 510 nm. In method 2, the amount of NAD remaining in the reaction mixture was determined by the method of Nussrallar et al. (17Nussrallar B.A. Dan R. Wagner F.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6245-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The sample was diluted to contain less than 0.3 mm of NAD, and the 100-μl aliquot was mixed with 100 μl of ethanol and 700 μl of 0.1 mglycine/NaOH buffer, pH 10.0. Equine liver alcohol dehydrogenase (0.1 units/100 μl) was added to the solution, and the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored for 3 min. The slope of the time-dependent increase in the absorbance was used to estimate the concentration of NAD. B. sphaericuswas grown on 4 liters of Luria-Bertani broth for 16 h at 37 °C and then inoculated to 30 liters of the same medium in a 40-liter vessel fermentor equipped with a mechanical stirrer. Cells were grown under aerobic conditions at 37 °C until an early stationary phase, harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 15 min and then washed twice with cold 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The cells (wet weight, 120 g) were suspended in 2 liters of the Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated at 30 °C for 6 h, and then dl-penicillamine (1% w/v) was added and incubated for another 6 h. Cells were suspended in 500 ml of the same buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm) and disrupted by sonication for 20 min, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Ammonium sulfate was added to 80% of the saturation, and precipitates were dissolved in the buffer (50 ml, pH 7.5) and dialyzed twice against 2 liters of the same buffer. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant solution was used as the crude cell extract of B. sphaericus. Enzyme purification was carried out at under 4 °C, and 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.01% 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) was used throughout the procedure. The crude cell extract was applied to DEAE Toyopearl 650m column (5.0 × 30 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column extensively with buffer A, the enzyme activity was eluted with a 0–0.5 m KCl linear gradient in the buffer. Active fractions were concentrated on Amicon YM-10 membrane and applied to a DyeMatrex Blue B column (15 mm × 14 cm), which was equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 2 volumes of 1 mm NADH and 1 mm NAD in the same buffer, and the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (0–0.5m) contained in buffer A. Active fractions were combined and concentrated on Centricut-mini (Kurabou, Japan). The enzyme was absorbed on the Dyematrex Orange A column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 1 mm of NADH and 1 mm of NAD in the buffer, and the enzyme was eluted with a 0–0.5 m KCl linear gradient. Active fractions were concentrated, and applied to TSK-GEL 3000SW column (7.5 × 600 mm, TOSOH, Japan) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 mKCl, and the active fractions were combined and concentrated on Centricut-mini. Molecular mass of the enzyme was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Purified enzyme was applied to a TSK-GEL 3000SW column in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1m sodium sulfate to estimate the native molecular size. The following molecular markers were used to calibrate the column: myoglobin (17,000), chicken ovalbumin (44,000), bovine gamma globulin (158,000), and bovine thyroglobulin (670,000). Substrate disappearance and product formation were monitored on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After protein was removed from the reaction mixture (1 ml) by adding 250 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid and subsequent centrifugation, a 20-μl aliquot of the sample was injected onto reverse-phase HPLC system consisting of Waters 600E system controller, an on-line degasser, and Waters 484 Tunable Absorbance Detector. Reverse-phase separation was achieved on μBondasphere C18 column (19 mm × 15 cm) using a linear gradient of 0–5% acetonitrile in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5, at a flow rate of 5.0 ml/min. Eluate was monitored by the absorbance at 260 nm. A reaction mixture (5 ml, pH 7.5) containing 30 mm NAD, 30 mml-penicillamine, adenylate deaminase (10 units; Sigma), and the purified enzyme (10 units) was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Enzyme reaction product has been purified by four successive preparative HPLC systems. 1) Preparative HPLC was performed as described under “Analytical HPLC.” 2) HPLC employed Superdex Peptide HR column (10 × 300 mm) eluted with deionized water at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. 3) Preparative HPLC was again performed on μBondasphere C18 column with 0–35% linear gradient of methanol in deionized water at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. 4) Ion exchange HPLC on a TSK-GEL DEAE-5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm) has been performed with a linear gradient of 10–300 mm NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.2). Eluate was monitored at 260 nm, and concentrated by lyophilization at each step of the preparative HPLC. ADP-l-penicillamine has been chemically synthesized by the method described by Rossomondoet al. (20Rossomondo E.F. Hadjimichael J. Varnum-Finney B. Soll D.R. Differentiation. 1987; 35: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with some modifications, and 31P NMR spectra of reaction mixture were obtained at each step of the synthesis. To the aqueous solution of ADP (5 mmol/8 ml), which was adjusted to pH 8 with triethylamine, 1-ethyl-3-(3dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (500 mmol/2 ml water) was added dropwise and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. An aqueous solution of l-penicillamine (50 mmol/10 ml, pH 8, with triethylamine) was added to the mixture, and the solution was incubated at 50 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was passed through a column (0.7 × 5 cm) of activated charcoal (Wako, Japan), and the column was thoroughly washed with deionized water. ADP-l-penicillamine was eluted with 50% aqueous ethanol, and was further purified by the preparative HPLC described above in 4). Purity of the synthetic ADP-l-penicillamine was verified by analytical reverse-phase HPLC. Kinetic properties of NAD:penicillamine ADP transferase were examined using the purified enzyme, and the activity was assayed by method 1. For kinetic studies, adenylate deaminase was not included in the assay mixture. Initial velocities of penicillamine disappearance were measured during the first 15 min, where we observed linear time-dependent substrate disappearance. Data were obtained by varying the concentration of one substrate with the fixed concentrations of the other, and presented as double-reciprocal plots as initial velocity versus varied substrate concentrations. Product inhibition studies were performed by including chemically synthesized ADP-l-penicillamine in the assay mixture at several fixed concentrations and varying the concentration of eitherl-penicillamine or NAD in the presence of fixed concentration of the other substrate (30 mml-penicillamine or 30 mm NAD). Double-reciprocal plots using initial velocity versus varied substrate concentrations were used to determine the mode of inhibition (21Cleland W.W. Enzymes. 1970; 2: 1-65Crossref Scopus (853) Google Scholar). A penicillamine-catabolizing bacterium has been isolated from a local soil sample collected in our university campus. The bacterium was identified as a strain of B. sphaericus based on the following biological characteristics: the microorganism was a Gram-positive, spherical spore forming, catalase positive bacterium, and it can grown on media at pH 6.0 but not on media containing 10% (w/v) NaCl. Starch was not used as a carbon source. The bacterium did not show the ability to consume dl-penicillamine when grown on Luria-Bertani broth. The enzyme activity was most effectively induced when the cells were incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at 30 °C for 6 h and then further incubated in the presence of 0.1% (w/v)dl-penicillamine for another 6 h. Cells treated with 0.1% dl-penicillamine consumed l-penicillamine at the rate of 0.3 μmol/min/g of wet cells at 30 °C. The rate ofd-penicillamine uptake was less than 0.1 μmol/min under the same conditions. The enzyme was induced by d- orl-penicillamine, and in either case cells consumedl-penicillamine more rapidly than the d-isomer.l-Valine, l-cysteine, l-leucine, and l-isoleucine did not induce the activity in the bacterial cells. Penicillamine-consuming activity in the cell extract has diminished when small molecules were removed by dialysis. To identify the molecules required for the activity, we have incubated the cell extract with 30 mm of NAD, NADP, NADH, NADPH, PLP, FAD, and FMN, respectively, with 30 mmdl-penicillamine, and penicillamine disappearance was measured by ninhydrin. Among the compounds tested, only NAD promoted the penicillamine consumption. When NAD and dl-penicillamine were incubated with cell extract for 1 h, NAD decreased at the rate of 1.5 ± 0.1 μmol/min, whereas penicillamine decreased at the similar rate of 1.6 ± 0.1 μmol/min. The amount of NAD remained unchanged whendl-penicillamine was omitted (Fig.1 A). The activity was not detected when the cell extract had been boiled for 10 min. Thus, the enzymatic penicillamine consumption appeared to be a NAD-dependent catalysis. Interestingly, we could not detect the formation of NADH by the UV absorbance at 340 nm, although 9 mm of NAD disappeared in the incubation period of 60 min. The concentration of thiol group in the crude cell extract, simultaneously determined by 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), also decreased but not in the accordance with the disappearance of amino group (Fig. 1 A, inset). Despite the competent enzyme activity induced in the cell extract, our preliminary attempts to identify the enzyme reaction products were not successful due to the small yield of products. It seemed likely that crude cell extract ofB. sphaericus contained enzymes for the succeeding pathway, and therefore the products were not accumulated. The NAD-dependent penicillamine-consuming enzyme was purified to the homogeneity with a yield of 7.7% in the four-step procedure summarized in Table I. Nucleotide affinity ligands, DyeMatrex Blue B and DyeMatrex Orange A were efficient means for this enzyme. Other affinity ligands such as DyeMatrex Blue A, Red A, and Green A were not effective for this enzyme. The purified enzyme showed the specific activity of 850 units/mg of protein. Gel filtration chromatography on TSK-GEL 3000SW column was used to estimate the molecular weight of the native enzyme as 42,000, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis suggested that the denatured protein has the molecular mass of 42 kDa (Fig. 2). The purified enzyme did not have chromophore groups detectable in the ultraviolet and visible regions. The enzyme showed high substrate specificity to penicillamine and NAD. Analogous amino acids such as l-valine,l-cysteine, l-cystine,l-homocysteine, l-leucine, andl-isoleucine did not serve as a substrate.d-Penicillamine was a poor substrate with theK m value of 200 mm. Nucleotides such as NADH, NADP, NADPH, ATP, ADP, AMP, ADP-ribose, nicotinamide mononucleotide, and nicotinamide did not substitute for NAD. Nucleotide triphosphates such as GTP, CTP, and TTP were also inert as the substrate. The effect of pH was examined using 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5–7.5) and 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0–8.5). The optimum pH was in a narrow range around 7.5; at pH 6.5 and 8.0 the activity decreased to 25 and 40% of the optimum activity, respectively. Although the choice of buffer was not as significant as the pH values, the activity with the phosphate buffer was about 85% of the activity with Tris buffer at the optimal pH 7.5. The optimum temperature for the catalysis was 37 °C.Table IPurification summary of NAD:penicillamine ADP transferaseProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitunit/mg%foldCrude extract17,0004020.0231001DEAE-Toyopearl9503400.368616DyeMatrex Blue B0.532204206518,000DyeMatrex Orange A0.12756303427,000TSK-GEL G3000W0.04348507.737,000aOne unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that consumes 1 μmol of l-penicillamine in a minute at pH 7.5.

The enzyme activity was measured in the presence of 30 mml-penicillamine and 30 mm NAD as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Potent product inhibition has been observed when the purified enzyme (12 μg; 10 units) was incubated for more than 1 h with 30 mml-penicillamine and 30 mm NAD at pH 7.5. The rate of substrate disappearance decreased in 1 h, and only 7% ofl-penicillamine was used in 6 h (Fig. 1 B). Supplementing enzyme to the mixture did not restore the activity. We tested ADP, ADP-ribose, AMP, and nicotinamide mononucleotide to see whether they could be inhibitory to the purified enzyme. ADP was found to act as a potent inhibitor (IC50 = 20 μm), whereas other compounds had no effects. To circumvent the product inhibition we tested adenylate deaminase and adenylate kinase to see if either of them could restore the catalysis. Adenylate kinase had no effects, but in the presence of adenylate deaminase (10 units), penicillamine consumption continued for 6 h, and the concentration of l-penicillamine has decreased to 6 mm (Fig.1 B). The reaction mixture was analyzed on the analytical reverse-phase HPLC system, and the eluate was monitored by the absorbance at 260 nm. Besides the remaining substrate NAD (24.0 min), nicotinamide (27.1 min), and an unknown compound (16.3 min) were detected in the reaction mixture. The unknown product was purified by the four-step preparative HPLC and lyophilized to give 75 mg of white powder. 1H NMR (500 MHz: D2O): δ 1.33 (3H, s), 1.43 (3H, s), 3.62 (1H, s), 4.02 (2H, m), 4.38 (2H, m), 6.03 (1H, d, J = 5.9 Hz), 8.10 (1H, s), 8.37 (1H, s). 31P NMR (80.9 MHz: D2O): δ - 8.9 (d, J = 21 Hz), 0.79 (dt, J = 21 Hz, 9.8 Hz). The enzyme reaction product did not react with ninhydrin, but acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the product liberated penicillamine molecule, which was identified as a ninhydrin-positive spot on thin layer chromatography. Other chemical tests indicated the presence of thiol group (by platinum chloride-potassium iodide reagent), phosphate (by ammonium molybdate-perchloric acid reagent), and ribose (by orcinol-iron (III) chloride-sulfuric acid reagent) contained in the compound.1H NMR showed the signals assigned to β,β-dimethyl group (δ 1.33 and δ 1.43) and α-proton (δ 3.62) of penicillamine, and the protons for ribose at 4.02, 4.38, and 6.03 ppm. Singlet signals at δ 7.8 and δ 8.2 indicated the presence of a purine base, which was identified as inosine by the absorption maximum at 248.5 nm. Fiske-SubaRow assay (22Leloir L.F. Carlos E.C. Method Enzymol. 1985; 115: 843-844Google Scholar) showed that the product contained two phosphates for one inosine base, which was determined by the UV absorption at 248.5 nm (ε = 12.2 mm−1). These results suggest that the product may consist of penicillamine and IDP. Besides the result that the compound was ninhydrin-negative, several lines of evidence suggested that the amino group of penicillamine and IDP are bound by a phosphoramide linkage. First, alkaline phosphatase and 5′-nucleotidase failed to release inorganic phosphate from the product, suggesting that the β-phosphate of the IDP group was occupied. Secondly, the enzyme reaction product was stable in alkaline solution but labile in acidic conditions. Phosphoramide bond has been reported to be labile in acidic solution but stable in alkaline solution (23Jencks W.P. Gilchrist M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 3199-3209Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas esters and acyl phosphate are unstable in alkaline solution (24Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952; 75: 2286-2292Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The enzyme reaction product has decomposed to IDP and penicillamine under the acidic conditions, but it survived the alkaline conditions (Fig.3). The decomposition reaction was reproducible but not reversible. The 31P NMR spectrum of the enzyme reaction product revealed two signals of the same peak intensity at δ −8.9 (d, J = 21 Hz) and δ 0.79 (dt, J = 21, 9.8 Hz) (Fig. 4). Quadrupole ion spray mass spectrometry showed that the product had the molecular mass of 558.5 in the negative ion mode, and it was in good agreement with the calculated mass for IDP-penicillamine, [M-H]− = 558.3735. Thus, the product was identified as IDP-penicillamine, the phosphoramide compound linked between the amino group of penicillamine and β-phosphate of IDP. Nicotinamide-ribose, the other product that would derive from NAD, was not detected in the reaction mixture, but nicotinamide has been identified in the reaction mixture. We have observed that nicotinamide-ribose prepared in situ by incubating nicotinamide mononucleotide with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase at pH 7.5 spontaneously decomposed to nicotinamide and ribose (data not shown).Figure 431 P NMR of the enzyme reaction product, IDP-penicillamine. The enzyme reaction product (10 mg) was dissolved in 700 μl of D2O, and 31P NMR spectrum was collected at 80.9 Hz at an ambient temperature. The spectrum is an average of 300 acquisitions and is referenced to an external standard of 85% phosphoric acid as 0 ppm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ADP-l-penicillamine has been chemically synthesized from ADP andl-penicillamine, and the reaction mixture was observed on31P NMR spectrometry at each step of the synthesis. On proton-decouple 31P NMR, ADP gave two doublet signals, α-phosphate at δ −8.9 (d, J = 21 Hz) and β-phosphate at δ −4.9 (d, J = 21 Hz). Then, the β-phosphate, activated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride, has shifted upfield by 13 ppm. Upon addition ofl-penicillamine, the β-phosphate signal has appeared at δ 0.79 as the double triplet signal. The α-phosphate signal at δ −8.9 did not change throughout the synthesis. Purified ADP-l-penicillamine showed the two signals of the same peak intensity at δ −8.9 (d, 21 Hz) and δ 0.79 (dt, 21, 9.8 Hz). Double-reciprocal plots gave converging lines when l-penicillamine was the variable substrate at fixed concentrations of NAD (Fig.5 A). The same pattern was also observed when NAD was the variable substrate using fixed concentrations of l-penicillamine (Fig. 5 B). A replot of the intercepts against the reciprocal of the concentration of fixed substrate was extrapolated to the x axis to reveal theK m values for each substrate (Fig. 5, Aand B, right graphs). K mvalues for l-penicillamine and NAD were 6.5 and 13.0 mm, respectively. Product inhibition studies were performed by including chemically synthesized ADP-l-penicillami"
