The pupil response not only indicates mental activity in itself but shows that mental activity is closely correlated with problem difficulty, and that the size of the pupil increases with the difficulty of the problem. These findings relate to recent Russian research on the pupillary reflex in connection with orienting and brain stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W2060494213,"Leafy twigs and seeds of juniper are abundant in nine ancient Neotoma middens discovered in low, arid, desert ranges devoid of junipers, near Frenchman Flat, Nevada. Existing vegetation is creosote bush and other desert shrubs. Twelve radiocarbon dates suggest that the middens were deposited between 7800 to more than 40,000 years ago. Dominance of Utah juniper and absence of pinyon pine in most deposits indicates a local Pleistocene woodland climate more arid than the usual pinyon-juniper climate."

https://openalex.org/W2082697903,The spectrum of XeO/sub 4/ is reported. The typical isotope pattern of Xe is repeated every 16 mass units up to XeO/sub 4/. The exact mass of the tetroxide was verified further by reference to the spectrum of Hg. The fragmentation pattern varied very little with the energy of the ionizing beam of electrons. The volatility of XeO/sub 4/ was demonstrated by its very rapid distillation when a liquid nitrogen bath was replaced by one of dry ice. (P.C.H.)

https://openalex.org/W2016949457,"Easily wettable pollen particles (contact angle theta < 90(o)) can be distinguished from poorly wettable particles (theta > 90(o)) by a simple laboratory test. Although some differences in degree of wettability were observed among the 15 pollens tested, all were wettable and most were strongly wettable. Grain wettability is not likely to suppress rain-scavenging efficiencies."

Chromospheric geometry, velocity fields, magnetic fields, thermodynamic equilibrium, thermodynamic structure, and chromospheric activity and space environment are discussed. (P.C.H.)"

Killing the plant material with steam markedly increases the drying rate by modifying the permeability of the cuticle or cell membrane, and this may have practical significance in forage preservation."
https://openalex.org/W1971652899,"By using the explosive nitroguanidine, continuous welds can be made between similar and dissimilar metals. Since low detonation pressures are attainable, pressure transfer media are not required between the explosive and the metal surface. The need for either a space or an angle between the metals is eliminated, and very low atmospheric pressures are not required. Successful welds have been made between tantalum and 4140 steel, 3003H14 aluminum and 4140 steel, and 304 stainless steel and 3003H14 aluminum."
https://openalex.org/W1986807201,The carbon dioxide pressure of the atmosphere of Venus may be controlled by one or more of several decarbonation reactions. One of these is the formation of carbonate-rich liquids. The pressure-temperature equilibrium conditions of these reactions are in the range of those proposed for the surface of Venus.

https://openalex.org/W2078139682,"The observation of x-ray emission from electron microscopes, which persisted for long periods, is reported. One incident occurred when oil vapor was drawn from the diffusion pump into the column because of failure of a sealing ring in the column. For a week or two after this occurrence, continuous x-ray emission was observed in an upward direction from the base of the gun whenever 100 kv was applied, accompanled by a gun-current reading due to the ion current. A second x-ray emission at 100 kv is also described. It is noted that additional lead glass protection was found desirable over the viewing window of the particular instrumert when lining up the column with 100 kv applied and the condenser aperture removed, because of x-ray emission from the screen.
