https://openalex.org/W1999350744,"Gaseous, neutral H(2)O was detected in the coma of comet Halley on 22.1 and 24.1 December 1985 Universal Time. Nine spectral lines of thev(3) band (2.65 micrometers) were found by means of a Fourier transform spectrometer (lambda/triangle uplambda approximately 10(5)) on the NASA-Kuiper Airborne Observatory. The water production rate was approximately 6 x 10(28) molecules per second on 22.1 December and 1.7 x 10(29) molecules per second on 24.1 December UT. The numbers of spectral lines and their intensities are in accord with nonthermal-equilibrium cometary models. Rotational populations are derived from the observed spectral line intensities and excitation conditions are discussed. The ortho-para ratio was found to be 2.66+/-0.13, corresponding to a nuclear-spin temperature of 32 K (+5 K, -2 K), possibly indicating that the observed water vapor originated from a low-temperature ice."
https://openalex.org/W2091857355,"Gastrula-stage embryos of the brine shrimp Artemia undergo reversible transitions between metabolically active and dormant states that are promoted by changes in intracellular pH. A macromolecular mechanism for this suppression of energy metabolism that involves regulation of the enzyme trehalase is reported here. Isolated trehalase from these embryos existed in two active forms that interconverted when exposed to physiological transitions in pH. This hysteretic interconversion was reversible, required minutes for completion, and involved a change in enzyme polymerization. The two states differed twofold in molecular size and were distinguishable electrophoretically. Compared to the smaller species, the polymerized form was strongly inhibited by acidic pH, adenosine 5â€²-triphosphate, and the substrate trehalose. Thus, the shift in assembly equilibrium toward the aggregated enzyme caused by pH values less than or equal to 7.4 may mediate the arrest of trehalose-fueled metabolism and respiration during dormancy in this cryptobiotic organism."
https://openalex.org/W2061168671,"Orchids of the Neotropical genus Catasetum have sexually dimorphic flowers; that is, male and female flowers are distinctly different in shape and color. Male flowers forcibly attach a large pollinarium onto euglossine bees. Euglossa bees leave the male flower in response to pollinarium emplacement by Catasetum ochraceum and subsequently avoid male but not female flowers. This evidence suggests that sexual dimorphism promotes pollination. The aversion of the bee to pollinarium attachment and its avoidance of male flowers thereafter apparently reflect competition among male flowers that probably evolved concurrently with sexual dimorphism. Among Catasetum species, the extent of dimorphism is correlated with the degree of apparent aversion caused by the male flower (weight of the pollinarium). Thus, aversive pollinarium emplacement can account for widespread sexual dimorphism in Catasetum and for interspecific variations in its expression."
https://openalex.org/W2036118713,"Directional ocean wave spectra derived from Shuttle Imaging Radar-B (SIR-B) L-band imagery collected off the coast of southern Chile on 11 and 12 October 1984 were compared with independent spectral estimates from two airborne scanning radars. In sea states with significant wave heights ranging from 3 to 5 meters, the SIR-B-derived spectra at 18 degrees and 25 degrees off nadir yielded reasonable estimates of wavelengths, directions, and spectral shapes for all wave systems encountered, including a purely azimuth-traveling system. A SIR-B image intensity variance spectrum containing predominantly range-traveling waves closely resembles an independent aircraft estimate of the slope variance spectrum. The prediction of a U.S. Navy global spectral ocean wave model on 11 October 1984 exhibited no significant bias in dominant wave number but contained a directional bias of about 30 degrees espect to the mean of the aircraft and spacecraft estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2023449933,"The universe is filled with thermal radiation having a current temperature of 2.75 K. Originating in the very early universe, this radiation furnishes strong evidence that the Big Bang cosmology best describes our expanding universe from an incredibly hot, compacted early stage until now. The model can be used to extrapolate our physics backward in time to predict events whose effects might be observable in the 2.75 K radiation today. The spectrum and isotropy are being studied with sophisticated microwave radiometers on the ground, in balloons, and in satellites. The results are as predicted by the simple theory: the spectrum is that of a blackbody (to a few percent) and the radiation is isotropic (to 0.01 percent) except for a local effect due to our motion through the radiation. However, a problem is emerging. Primordial fluctuations in the mass density, which later became the great clusters of galaxies that we see today, should have left an imprint on the 2.75 K radiation-bumpiness on the sky at angular scales of about 10 arc minutes. They have not yet been seen."
https://openalex.org/W2056303512,"The Shuttle Imaging Radar-B experiment consisted of a large number of scientific investigations in the earth sciences. Nine oceanographic experiments were conducted to study the generation and propagation of surface waves, the dynamics of internal waves, oil slick detection, and the properties of southern polar ice. Stereo imaging from space allowed three-dimensional viewing of surface features. Geologic experiments were conducted to study subsurface penetration, structural mapping, and lithologic classification. Imaging radar angular scatterometry was used in the vegetation cover, forest type, and urban areas classification experiments. This article provides an overview of the scientific results, some of which are also presented in this issue."
https://openalex.org/W2058148226,"An image from the Shuttle Imaging Radar-B (SIR-B) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) shows internal wave features in an area south of Long Island, New York Coincident oceanographic measurements are used in conjunction with hydrodynamic interaction and electromagnetic scattering models to estimate the expected SAR image intensity modulations associated with the internal waves. There is reasonable agreement between the predicted and observed internal wave signatures."
