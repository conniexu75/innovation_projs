https://openalex.org/W2942506530,"Like many other crops, the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is of hybrid origin and has a polyploid genome that contains essentially complete sets of chromosomes from two ancestral species. Here we report the genome sequence of peanut and show that after its polyploid origin, the genome has evolved through mobile-element activity, deletions and by the flow of genetic information between corresponding ancestral chromosomes (that is, homeologous recombination). Uniformity of patterns of homeologous recombination at the ends of chromosomes favors a single origin for cultivated peanut and its wild counterpart A. monticola. However, through much of the genome, homeologous recombination has created diversity. Using new polyploid hybrids made from the ancestral species, we show how this can generate phenotypic changes such as spontaneous changes in the color of the flowers. We suggest that diversity generated by these genetic mechanisms helped to favor the domestication of the polyploid A. hypogaea over other diploid Arachis species cultivated by humans."

Defects in DNA mismatch repair prevent tumors from repairing certain types of DNA damage and lead to a hypermutable genomic state known as microsatellite instability (MSI). Some tumors with a high degree of MSI may be treatable with PD-1 (programmed cell death–1) immunotherapy, but patient response is highly variable. Mandal et al. studied drivers of differential response to immunotherapy in these patients and found that MSI intensity and insertion-deletion mutations strongly affected therapeutic outcome.

Here we report a high-quality peanut genome sequence, comprising 2.54 Gb with 20 pseudomolecules and 83,709 protein-coding gene models. We characterize gene functional groups implicated in seed size evolution, seed oil content, disease resistance and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The peanut B subgenome has more genes and general expression dominance, temporally associated with long-terminal-repeat expansion in the A subgenome that also raises questions about the A-genome progenitor. The polyploid genome provided insights into the evolution of Arachis hypogaea and other legume chromosomes. Resequencing of 52 accessions suggests that independent domestications formed peanut ecotypes. Whereas 0.42-0.47 million years ago (Ma) polyploidy constrained genetic variation, the peanut genome sequence aids mapping and candidate-gene discovery for traits such as seed size and color, foliar disease resistance and others, also providing a cornerstone for functional genomics and peanut improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2898929289,"Predicting behavior of visual neurons To what extent are predictive deep learning models of neural responses useful for generating experimental hypotheses? Bashivan et al. took an artificial neural network built to model the behavior of the target visual system and used it to construct images predicted to either broadly activate large populations of neurons or selectively activate one population while keeping the others unchanged. They then analyzed the effectiveness of these images in producing the desired effects in the macaque visual cortex. The manipulations showed very strong effects and achieved considerable and highly selective influence over the neuronal populations. Using novel and non-naturalistic images, the neural network was shown to reproduce the overall behavior of the animals' neural responses. Science , this issue p. eaav9436"
https://openalex.org/W2943545339,"Defects in conventional semiconductors substantially lower the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), a key metric of optoelectronic performance that directly dictates the maximum device efficiency. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as monolayer MoS2, often exhibit low PL QY for as-processed samples, which has typically been attributed to a large native defect density. We show that the PL QY of as-processed MoS2 and WS2 monolayers reaches near-unity when they are made intrinsic by electrostatic doping, without any chemical passivation. Surprisingly, neutral exciton recombination is entirely radiative even in the presence of a high native defect density. This finding enables TMDC monolayers for optoelectronic device applications as the stringent requirement of low defect density is eased."

During this period, bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) emerged as one of the world’s most important crops. We use exome sequencing of a worldwide panel of almost 500 genotypes selected from across the geographical range of the wheat species complex to explore how 10,000 years of hybridization, selection, adaptation and plant breeding has shaped the genetic makeup of modern bread wheats. We observe considerable genetic variation at the genic, chromosomal and subgenomic levels, and use this information to decipher the likely origins of modern day wheats, the consequences of range expansion and the allelic variants selected since its domestication. Our data support a reconciled model of wheat evolution and provide novel avenues for future breeding improvement. Exome sequencing of a worldwide panel of 487 wheat genotypes, including landraces, cultivars and modern varieties, sheds light on wheat genomic diversity and the evolution of modern bread wheat."

Adaptation requires genomic variability, but declining populations lose diversity, which casts doubt on adaptation as a survival mechanism in today's world. Oziolor et al. report a case of rapid adaptation to pollution in killifish, apparently enabled by introduction of a non-native congener within the last 30 generations (see the Perspective by Pfennig). This related species, possibly carried in ship ballast water, appears to have provided advantageous genetic variability that has allowed the native fish to adapt to its increasingly polluted environment.

To examine how genomic variation affects proximal (cis) or distal (trans) gene regulation, Delaneau et al. analyzed gene expression, chromatin, and the three-dimensional conformation of the genome. Clustering regulatory elements and activity across individuals reveals genomic structures termed cis-regulatory domains and trans-regulatory hubs that affect gene expression. Associations between these structures and genes within and across chromosomes contribute to links between noncoding genetic variation and gene expression. Science , this issue p. eaat8266"

https://openalex.org/W2906311680,"When combining information across different senses, humans need to flexibly select cues of a common origin while avoiding distraction from irrelevant inputs. The brain could solve this challenge using a hierarchical principle by deriving rapidly a fused sensory estimate for computational expediency and, later and if required, filtering out irrelevant signals based on the inferred sensory cause(s). Analyzing time- and source-resolved human magnetoencephalographic data, we unveil a systematic spatiotemporal cascade of the relevant computations, starting with early segregated unisensory representations, continuing with sensory fusion in parietal-temporal regions, and culminating as causal inference in the frontal lobe. Our results reconcile previous computational accounts of multisensory perception by showing that prefrontal cortex guides flexible integrative behavior based on candidate representations established in sensory and association cortices, thereby framing multisensory integration in the generalized context of adaptive behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2943583691,"Brain map of touch sensation The brain's somatosensory cortex contains a topographical map that reflects touch sensation inputs. During embryonic development, axons from the midbrain thalamus build columnar connections to the cortex in the absence of sensory input. Working in mice, Antón-Bolaños et al. found that these thalamocortical connections are responsible for organizing the somatosensory cortex (see the Perspective by Tiriac and Feller). Organization of the map in the cortex depends on spontaneous calcium waves in the embryonic thalamus. Thus, the somatosensory map is sketched out before actual sensory input begins to refine the details. Science , this issue p. 987 ; see also p. 933"

https://openalex.org/W2942764308,"Maintaining average activity within a set-point range constitutes a fundamental property of central neural circuits. However, whether and how activity set points are regulated remains unknown. Integrating genome-scale metabolic modeling and experimental study of neuronal homeostasis, we identified mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) as a regulator of activity set points in hippocampal networks. The DHODH inhibitor teriflunomide stably suppressed mean firing rates via synaptic and intrinsic excitability mechanisms by modulating mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering and spare respiratory capacity. Bi-directional activity perturbations under DHODH blockade triggered firing rate compensation, while stabilizing firing to the lower level, indicating a change in the firing rate set point. In vivo, teriflunomide decreased CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission and CA1 mean firing rate and attenuated susceptibility to seizures, even in the intractable Dravet syndrome epilepsy model. Our results uncover mitochondria as a key regulator of activity set points, demonstrate the differential regulation of set points and compensatory mechanisms, and propose a new strategy to treat epilepsy."

Control is exerted by phosphorylation of the general translation initiation factor eIF2. eIF2 is a guanosine triphosphatase that becomes activated by eIF2B, a two-fold symmetric and heterodecameric complex that functions as eIF2's dedicated nucleotide exchange factor. Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate into an inhibitor of eIF2B. We report cryo-electron microscopy structures of eIF2 bound to eIF2B in the dephosphorylated state. The structures reveal that the eIF2B decamer is a static platform upon which one or two flexible eIF2 trimers bind and align with eIF2B's bipartite catalytic centers to catalyze nucleotide exchange. Phosphorylation refolds eIF2α, allowing it to contact eIF2B at a different interface and, we surmise, thereby sequestering it into a nonproductive complex."

We identified 25 transcriptome-wide association study significant genes, 7 at the junction level only, including LRRC46 at 19q21.32, (P = 1 × 10-9), CHMP4C at 8q21 (P = 2 × 10-11) and a PRC1 junction at 15q26 (P = 7 × 10-9). In vitro assays for CHMP4C showed that the associated variant induces allele-specific exon inclusion (P = 0.0024). Functional screens in HGSOC cell lines found evidence of essentiality for three of the new genes we identified: HAUS6, KANSL1 and PRC1, with the latter comparable to MYC.

https://openalex.org/W2942929183,"Methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is a prevalent DNA modification found in many organisms. Sequential oxidation of 5mC by ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases results in a cascade of additional epigenetic marks and promotes demethylation of DNA in mammals1,2. However, the enzymatic activity and function of TET homologues in other eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here we show that the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains a 5mC-modifying enzyme (CMD1) that is a TET homologue and catalyses the conjugation of a glyceryl moiety to the methyl group of 5mC through a carbon–carbon bond, resulting in two stereoisomeric nucleobase products. The catalytic activity of CMD1 requires Fe(ii) and the integrity of its binding motif His-X-Asp, which is conserved in Fe-dependent dioxygenases3. However, unlike previously described TET enzymes, which use 2-oxoglutarate as a co-substrate4, CMD1 uses l-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as an essential co-substrate. Vitamin C donates the glyceryl moiety to 5mC with concurrent formation of glyoxylic acid and CO2. The vitamin-C-derived DNA modification is present in the genome of wild-type C. reinhardtii but at a substantially lower level in a CMD1 mutant strain. The fitness of CMD1 mutant cells during exposure to high light levels is reduced. LHCSR3, a gene that is critical for the protection of C. reinhardtii from photo-oxidative damage under high light conditions, is hypermethylated and downregulated in CMD1 mutant cells compared to wild-type cells, causing a reduced capacity for photoprotective non-photochemical quenching. Our study thus identifies a eukaryotic DNA base modification that is catalysed by a divergent TET homologue and unexpectedly derived from vitamin C, and describes its role as a potential epigenetic mark that may counteract DNA methylation in the regulation of photosynthesis. An algal TET dioxygenase homologue, CMD1, uses vitamin C as a glycerol donor to modify 5-methylcytosine and helps to regulate gene transcription in response to high light levels."
https://openalex.org/W2943730329,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious pubic health concern and known to have the adverse effects on mother's perinatal wellbeing; and child's physical and cognitive development. There were limited literatures on PPD in Bangladesh, especially in urban slum context. The aim of this study was to assess the burden and risk factors of PPD among the urban slum women. A cross-sectional study was conducted between November-December 2017 in three urban slums on 376 women within first 12 months of postpartum. A validated Bangla version of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to measure the depression status. Respondent's socio-economic characteristics and other risk factors were collected with structured validated questionaire by trained interviewers. Unadjusted Prevalence Ratio (PR) and Adjusted Prevalence Ratio (APR) were estimated with Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) respectively to identify the risk factors of PPD. The prevalence of PPD was 39.4% within first 12 months following the child birth. Job involvement after child delivery (APR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1, 3.3), job loss due to pregnancy (APR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0, 2.1), history of miscarriage or still birth or child death (APR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0, 2.0), unintended pregnancy (APR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.3, 2.5), management of delivery cost by borrowing, selling or mortgaging assets (APR = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.9, 1.9), depressive symptom during pregnancy (APR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.7, 3.8) and intimate partner violence (APR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.2, 3.3), were identified as risk factors. PPD was not associated with poverty, mother in law and any child related factors. The burden of postpartum depression was high in the urban slum of Bangladesh.

https://openalex.org/W2943672274,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, and both genetic and histopathological evidence have implicated the ubiquitous presynaptic protein α-synuclein (αSyn) in its pathogenesis. Recent work has investigated how disrupting αSyn’s interaction with membranes triggers trafficking defects, cellular stress, and apoptosis. Special interest has been devoted to a series of mutants exacerbating the effects of the E46K mutation (associated with autosomal dominant PD) through homologous Glu-to-Lys substitutions in αSyn’s N-terminal region (i.e. E35K and E61K). Such E46K-like mutants have been shown to cause dopaminergic neuron loss and severe but L-DOPA–responsive motor defects in mouse overexpression models, presenting enormous translational potential for PD and other “synucleinopathies.” In this work, using a variety of biophysical techniques, we characterize the molecular pathology of E46K-like αSyn mutants by studying their structure and membrane-binding and remodeling abilities. We find that, although a slight increase in the mutants’ avidity for synaptic vesicle–like membranes can be detected, most of their deleterious effects are connected to their complete disruption of αSyn’s curvature selectivity. Indiscriminate binding can shift αSyn’s subcellular localization away from its physiological interactants at the synaptic bouton toward trafficking vesicles and organelles, as observed in E46K-like cellular and murine models, as well as in human pathology. In conclusion, our findings suggest that a loss of curvature selectivity, rather than increased membrane affinity, could be the critical dyshomeostasis in synucleinopathies.

https://openalex.org/W2942988581,"Aspalathin is a rooibos flavonoid with established blood glucose lowering properties, however, its efficacy to moderate complications associated with hepatic insulin resistance is unknown. To study such effects, C3A liver cells exposed to palmitate were used as a model of hepatic insulin resistance. These hepatocytes displayed impaired substrate metabolism, including reduced glucose transport and free fatty acid uptake. These defects included impaired insulin signaling, evident through reduced phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/ protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) protein expression, and mitochondrial dysfunction, depicted by a lower mitochondrial respiration rate. Aspalathin was able to ameliorate these defects by correcting altered substrate metabolism, improving insulin signaling and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Activation of 5ʹ-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may be a plausible mechanism by which aspalathin increases hepatic energy expenditure. Overall, these results encourage further studies assessing the potential use of aspalathin as a nutraceutical to improve hepatocellular energy expenditure, and reverse metabolic disease-associated complications."

https://openalex.org/W2942804495,"Background Existing research has suggested that self-reported empathy in medical students is moderated by personality traits and diverse demographic and educational factors including age, gender, nationality, career aspirations, as well as year of curriculum. It is unclear how empathy, personality, and background factors might impact on students’ attitudes towards professionalism in medicine. Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted in first and final year medical students at an Irish medical school. The following instruments were administered: (a) Jefferson Scale of Empathy; (b) NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI-3); (c) Attitudes towards Professionalism Scale. Demographic and educational variables were also measured. Descriptive and correlational analysis was conducted to examine the association between empathy, personality, professionalism-related attitudes and additional measures. Regression analysis was used to examine determinants of attitudes towards professional behaviour. Results Both selected NEO-FFI personality traits and empathy were independently associated with distinct categories of professional behaviour. Specifically, Openness to Experience was associated with higher empathy scores, and higher ‘Social responsibility’. Extraversion was linked with higher scores on the “Personal characteristics” and “Interactions with team” categories, while Conscientiousness was also positively associated with “Personal characteristics”. In agreement with previous studies, the personality traits most associated empathy were Agreeableness and Openness to Experience. Empathy did not vary according to programme year or career specialty preference. Conclusions This study is the first to show that empathy and personality factors may act as determinants of students’ attitudes towards medical professionalism in a manner which is dependent upon category of professional behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2943442373,"Currently, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is widely acknowledged to be the first leading cause of fatality in the world with 31% of all deaths worldwide and is predicted to remain as such in 2030. Furthermore, CVD is also a major cause of morbidity in adults worldwide. Among these diseases, the coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause, accounting for over 40% of CVD deaths. Despite a decline in mortality rates, the consequences of more effective preventive and management programs, the burden of CAD remains significant. Indeed, the rise in the prevalence of modifiable risk factors due to changes in lifestyle and health behaviors has further increased the burden of this epidemic. Our objective was to evaluate the hospital burden of CAD via MI trends and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) in the French Prospective Payment System (PPS).MI/PCI were identified in the national PPS database from 2009 to 2014 for patients aged 20 to 99, living in metropolitan France. We examined hospitalisation, readmission and mortality trends using standardised rates.Over the six-year period, we identified 678,021 patients, representing 900,121 stays of which, 215,224 had a MI and a PCI. Admission trends increased by nearly 25%. Acute MI cases increased every year, with an alarming increase in women, and more specifically in young women. Men were 3 times more hospitalised than women, who were older. A North-South divide was noted. Twenty seven percent of patients experienced readmission within 1 month. Trajectories of care were significantly different by sex and age. Overall in-hospital death was 3.3%, decreasing by 15% during the period. The highest adjusted mortality rates were observed for inpatients aged <40 or >80.We outlined the public health burden of this condition and the importance of improving the trajectories of care as an aid for better care."

https://openalex.org/W2942841616,"African trypanosomiasis remains a lethal disease to both humans and livestock. The disease persists due to limited drug availability, toxicity and drug resistance, hence the need for a better understanding of the parasite’s biology and provision of alternative forms of therapy. In this study, the in vitro effects of phenolic acids were assessed for their trypanocidal activities against Trypanosoma brucei brucei. The effect of the phenolic acids on Trypanosoma brucei brucei was determined by the alamarBlue assay. The cell cycle effects were determined by flow cytometry and parasite morphological analysis was done by microscopy. Effect on cell proliferation was determined by growth kinetic analysis. Reverse Transcriptase quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to determine expression of iron dependent enzymes and iron distribution determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Gallic acid gave an IC50 of 14.2±1.5 μM. Deferoxamine, gallic acid and diminazene aceturate showed a dose dependent effect on the cell viability and the mitochondrion membrane integrity. Gallic acid, deferoxamine and diminazene aceturate caused loss of kinetoplast in 22%, 26% and 82% of trypanosomes respectively and less than 10% increase in the number of trypanosomes in S phase was observed. Gallic acid caused a 0.6 fold decrease, 50 fold increase and 7 fold increase in the expression levels of the transferrin receptor, ribonucleotide reductase and cyclin 2 genes respectively while treatment with deferoxamine and diminazene aceturate also showed differential expressions of the transferrin receptor, ribonucleotide reductase and cyclin 2 genes. The data suggests that gallic acid possibly exerts its effect on T. brucei via iron chelation leading to structural and morphological changes and arrest of the cell cycle. These together provide information on the cell biology of the parasite under iron starved conditions and provide leads into alternative therapeutic approaches in the treatment of African trypanosomiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2950282646,"We have previously shown that a single application of the growth factors ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) or fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) to the crushed optic nerve of the frog, Rana pipiens, increases the numbers and elongation rate of regenerating retinal ganglion cell axons. Here we investigate the effects of these factors on the numbers and types of macrophages that invade the regeneration zone. In control PBS-treated nerves, many macrophages are present 100 μm distal to the crush site at 1 week after injury; their numbers halve by 2 weeks. A single application of CNTF at the time of injury triples the numbers of macrophages at 1 week, with this increase compared to control being maintained at 2 weeks. Application of FGF-2 is equally effective at 1 week, but the macrophage numbers have fallen to control levels at 2 weeks. Immunostaining with a pan-macrophage marker, ED1, and a marker for M2-like macrophages, Arg-1, showed that the proportion of the putative M2 phenotype remained at approximately 80% with all treatments. Electron microscopy of the macrophages at 1 week shows strong phagocytic activity with all treatments, with many vacuoles containing axon fragments and membrane debris. At 2 weeks with PBS or FGF-2 treatment the remaining macrophages are less phagocytically active, containing mainly lipid inclusions. With CNTF treatment, at 2 weeks many of the more numerous macrophages are still phagocytosing axonal debris, although they also contain lipid inclusions. We conclude that the increase in macrophage influx seen after growth factor application is beneficial for the regenerating axons, probably due to more extensive removal of degenerating distal axons, but also perhaps to secretion of growth-promoting substances."

https://openalex.org/W2949825095,"Robust inferences of environmental condition come from bioindicators that have strong relationships with stressors and are minimally confounded by extraneous environmental variables. These indicator properties are generally assumed for assemblage-based indicators such as diatom transfer functions that use species abundance data to infer environmental variables. However, failure of assemblage approaches necessitates the interpretation of individual dominant taxa when making environmental inferences. To determine whether diatom species from Laurentian Great Lakes sediment cores have the potential to provide unambiguous inferences of anthropogenic stress, we evaluated fossil diatom abundance against a suite of historical environmental gradients: human population, agriculture, mining, atmospheric nutrient deposition, atmospheric temperature and ice cover. Several diatom species, such as Stephanodiscus parvus, had reliable relationships with anthropogenic stress such as human population. However, many species had little or no indicator value or had confusing relationships with multiple environmental variables, suggesting one should be careful when using those species to infer stress in the Great Lakes. Recommendations for future approaches to refining diatom indicators are discussed, including accounting for the effects of broad species geographic distributions to minimize region-specific responses that can weaken indicator power."
https://openalex.org/W2943358447,"A child's school achievement is influenced by environmental factors. The environmental factors, when represented by socio-economic status (SES) of the family, have been demonstrated to be related to the reading skills of a child. The neural correlates of the relation between SES and reading have been less thoroughly investigated. The present study expands current research by exploring the relation between SES, quantified by paternal educational level, reading of the offspring and the structure of white matter pathways in the left hemisphere as derived from DTI-based tractography analyses. Therefore, three dorsal white matter pathways, i.e. the long, anterior and posterior segments of the arcuate fasciculus (AF), and three ventral white matter pathways, i.e. the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and the uncinate fasciculus (UF), were manually dissected in the left hemisphere of 34 adolescents with a wide range of reading skills. The results demonstrated a relation between word reading, SES quantified by paternal educational level, and fractional anisotropy (FA) within the left dorsal AF segment and the left ventral UF. Thus, the present study proposes a relationship between paternal educational level and a specific white matter pathway that is important for reading, aiming to guide future research that can determine processes underlying this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2942685039,"Objectives To characterize breast cancer patients who received telephone-based consultations of oncology nurse navigator via telemedical care (TMC patients) and analyze their healthcare utilization (HCU) one year before and after receiving this service. Methods A retrospective study among Maccabi Healthcare Services enrollees that were newly diagnosed during 2016 (n = 1035). HCU, demographic characteristics and comorbidities were obtained from computerized database. Multivariable ordered logit model was specified for the determinants of HCU by quarters. Independent variables included: annual number of telephone-based consultations, gap between diagnosis and first consultation, age, socio-economic status, eligibility for disability and income security benefits, and comorbidities. Results Twenty-two percent of our cohort were TMC patients. Compared to others, these patients were younger and had a lower prevalence of hypertension. A higher proportion of these patients received disability benefits, and a lower proportion received income security benefits. The total average annual HCU of TMC patients (n = 107) before first consultation was $8857 and increased to $44130 in the first year following it (p<0.001), predominantly due to a significant increase in outpatient visits ($20380 vs. $3502, p<0.001) and medication costs ($19339 vs. $1758, p<0.001). The multivariable model revealed that each additional telephone-based consultation decreased the likelihood to be in the lowest quarter of the HCU distribution by 1.1 percentage points (p = 0.015), and increased the likelihood to be in the upper quarter of the HCU distribution by 1.1 percentage points (p = 0.016). Conclusions There was a significant increase in outpatient care and medications usage following first consultation. Moreover, a more intense use of this service was associated with elevated HCU. This result may stem from the proactive nature of the telemedical care."
https://openalex.org/W2943339594,"The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) mediate the cellular effects of retinoids (derivatives of vitamin A). Both RAR and RXR signaling events are implicated in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, retinoids can interact with calcium signaling during homeostatic plasticity. We recently provided evidence that retinoids attenuate calcium current (ICa) through neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). We now examined the possibility that constitutive activity of neuronal RXR and/or RAR alters calcium influx via the VGCCs. We found that in neurons of the mollusk Lymnaea stagnalis, two different RXR antagonists (PA452 and HX531) had independent and opposing effects on ICa that were also time-dependent; whereas the RXR pan-antagonist PA452 enhanced ICa, HX531 reduced ICa. Interestingly, this effect of HX531 occurred through voltage-dependent inhibition of VGCCs, a phenomenon known to influence neurotransmitter release from neurons. This inhibition appeared to be independent of G proteins and was largely restricted to Cav2 Ca2+ channels. Of note, an RAR pan-antagonist, LE540, also inhibited ICa but produced G protein–dependent, voltage-dependent inhibition of VGCCs. These findings provide evidence that retinoid receptors interact with G proteins in neurons and suggest mechanisms by which retinoids might affect synaptic calcium signaling."

Obesity is associated with catecholamine resistance and blunted β-adrenergic receptor signaling activities, which could dampen lipolysis and energy expenditure resulting in weight gain. In the current study, we examined effect of MetAP2 inhibition on brown adipose tissue and brown adipocytes. Norepinephrine increases energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue by providing fatty acid substrate through lipolysis and by increasing expression of uncoupled protein-1 (UCP1). Metabolomic analysis shows that in response to MetAP2 inhibitor treatment, fatty acid metabolites in brown adipose tissue increase transiently and subsequently decrease to basal or below basal levels, suggesting an effect on fatty acid metabolism in this tissue. Treatment of brown adipocytes with MetAP2 inhibitors enhances norepinephrine-induced lipolysis and energy expenditure, and prolongs the activity of norepinephrine to increase ucp1 gene expression and energy expenditure in norepinephrine-desensitized brown adipocytes. In summary, we showed that the anti-obesity activity of MetAP2 inhibitors can be mediated, at least in part, through direct action on brown adipocytes by enhancing β-adrenergic–signaling–stimulated activities.

https://openalex.org/W2942505195,"Background There are few quantitative studies on palliative care provision to Indigenous Australians, a population known to experience distinctive barriers to quality healthcare and to have poorer health outcomes than other Australians. Objectives To investigate equity of specialist palliative care service provision through characterising and comparing Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients at entry to care. Methods Using data (01/01/2010–30/06/2015) from all services participating in the multi-jurisdictional Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration, Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients entering palliative care were compared on proportions vis-à-vis those expected from national statutory datasets, demographic characteristics, and entry-to-care status across fourteen ‘problem’ domains (e.g., pain, functional impairment) after matching by age, sex, and specific diagnosis. Results Of 140,267 patients, 1,465 (1.0%, much lower than expected from statutory data) were Indigenous, 133,987 (95.5%) non-Indigenous, and 4,905 (3.5%) had a missing identifier. The proportion of patients with a missing identifier diminished markedly over the study period, without a corresponding increase in the proportion identified as Indigenous. Indigenous compared with non-Indigenous patients were younger (mean 62.8 versus 73.0 years, p<0.001), a higher proportion were female (51.5% versus 46.3%; p<0.001) or resided outside major cities (44.2% versus 21.5%, p<0.001). Across all domains, Indigenous compared with matched non-Indigenous patients had lower or equal risk of status requiring prompt intervention. Conclusions Indigenous patients (especially those residing outside major cities) are substantially under-represented in care by services participating in the nationwide specialist palliative care Collaboration, likely reflecting widespread access barriers. However, the similarity of status indicators among Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients at entry to care suggests that Indigenous patients who are able to access these services do not disproportionately experience clinically important impediments to care initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2943122332,"Anthrax is considered endemic in livestock in Georgia. In 2007, the annual vaccination became the responsibility of livestock owners, while contracting of private veterinarians was not officially required. Six years later, due to increase in human outbreaks associated with livestock handling, there is a need to find out the risk factors of livestock anthrax in Georgia.To identify exposures and risk factors associated with livestock anthrax.A matched case-control study design was used to recruit the owners of individual livestock anthrax cases that occurred between June 2013 and May 2015, and owners of unaffected livestock from within (""village control"") and outside the village (""area control""). We collected data about the case and control livestock animals' exposure and risk factors within the one-month prior to the disease onset of the case livestock (or matched case for the controls). We used logistic regression analysis (univariate and multivariable) to calculate the odds ratios of exposures and risk factors.During the study period, 36 anthrax cases met the case definition and were enrolled in the study; 67 matched village control livestock and 71 matched area control livestock were also enrolled. The findings from multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrate that vaccination within the last two years significantly reduced the odds of anthrax in cattle (OR = 0.014; 95% Confidence interval = <0.001, 0.99). The other factors that were significantly protective against anthrax were 'animals being in covered fence area/barn' (OR = 0.065; p-value = 0.036), and 'female animal being pregnant or milking compared to heifer' (OR = 0.006; p-value = 0.037).The information obtained from this study has involved and been presented to decision makers, used to build technical capacity of veterinary staff, and to foster a One Health approach to the control of zoonotic diseases which will optimize prevention and control strategies. Georgia has embedded the knowledge and specific evidence that vaccination is a highly protective measure to prevent anthrax deaths among livestock, to which primary emphasis of the anthrax control program will be given. Education of livestock keepers in Georgia is an overriding priority."
https://openalex.org/W2943769121,"In this paper, we propose an Emotional Trigger System to impart an automatic emotion expression ability within the humanoid robot REN-XIN, in which the Emotional Trigger is an emotion classification model trained from our proposed Word Mover’s Distance(WMD) based algorithm. Due to the long time delay of the WMD-based Emotional Trigger System, we propose an enhanced Emotional Trigger System to enable a smooth interaction with the robot in which the Emotional Trigger is replaced by a conventional convolution neural network and a long short term memory network (CNN_LSTM)-based deep neural network. In our experiments, the CNN_LSTM based model only need 10 milliseconds or less to finish the classification without a decrease in accuracy, while the WMD-based model needed approximately 6-8 seconds to give a result. In this paper, the experiments are conducted based on the same sub-data sets of the Chinese emotional corpus(Ren_CECps) used in former WMD experiments: one comprises 50% data for training and 50% for testing(1v1 experiment), and the other comprises 80% data for training and 20% for testing(4v1 experiment). The experiments are conducted using WMD, CNN_LSTM, CNN and LSTM. The results show that CNN_LSTM obtains the best F1 score (0.35) in the 1v1 experiment and almost the same accuracy of F1 scores (0.366 vs 0.367) achieved by WMD in the 4v1 experiment. Finally, we present demonstration videos with the same scenario to show the performance of robot control driven by CNN_LSTM-based Emotional Trigger System and WMD-based Emotional Trigger System. To improve the comparison, total manual-control performance is also recorded."

I feel I've reached the lowest point in my life, with little hope that I will be able to finish my Ph.D. It has only been 8 days since I agreed to give up singing, yet it feels like an eternity. Singing had provided a welcome balance to my scientific pursuits. But after a roller-coaster year, including a switch to a new adviser and myriad family and relationship issues, my work had suffered. Something had to give. I thought it needed to be music.

> “Although studying pollution drives me, not being able to sing drives me mad.” 

About 3 years earlier, I had decided to do my Ph.D. in New York City in part for the musical opportunities. I joined the university chorus and several opera productions. Juggling my academic responsibilities and singing stretched me thin sometimes. But, after a long day of classes or hours in front of my computer screen trying to debug code, singing helped me decompress, recharge, and recalibrate.

During my second year, things started to take a turn. My original adviser left for a different institution. My new adviser was very supportive but had a much more hands-on approach than I was used to. I also needed to prepare for my qualifying exams at the end of the year. At times I considered dropping music. “You're doing a Ph.D. in air pollution, not music,” I told myself. “Priorities, priorities, priorities.”

But when I remembered the joy and relaxation that I get from music-making, I rejected the idea. In fact, I took on one of the biggest, most challenging roles I've ever had: the title role in an oratorio. Preparing for the performance and my qualifying exam at the same time was a lot to manage. But every time I immersed myself in the music, I was transported away from the stresses of grad school—and when I came back, I was in better mental and emotional shape to tackle my scientific work again.

I got through my qualifying exam, but my relationship with my new adviser was still bumpy. Spending the following summer in China didn't help. My research is on air pollution and health in China, and most of my extended family lives there. But 3 months without face-to-face interaction with my adviser did not improve our dynamic. Miscommunications piled up. My adviser sent me an email saying that we needed to have a serious conversation when I got back. I was dreading my return—all but the music. I looked forward to rehearsing for the roles I had lined up and resuming my voice lessons.

Upon my return—on Friday the 13th, no less—my adviser and I sat down for our talk. I was not meeting expectations; my dissertation research needed to be my top priority. My adviser didn't know exactly how important music was for me and was just trying to help me be successful in my Ph.D. But I felt that giving up singing was my only choice. Maybe this would help get my doctoral work back on track. I wrote apologetic emails left and right, cutting all of my singing engagements.

The result? I was miserable. I lost the motivation to get out of bed in the morning, let alone do research. I realized that although studying pollution drives me, not being able to sing drives me mad.

So, I sent emails begging for the roles I had dropped. Amazingly, the directors all took me back. And a strange thing happened: I redoubled my efforts, on both my research and my relationship with my adviser. We started to meet weekly, with progress reports due. These new, more frequent deadlines were very stressful, but I scheduled my voice lessons to immediately follow each meeting. I clung to music like a rope dangling over a bottomless pit.

Gradually, my adviser and I built a strong relationship, and my research finally seemed to head in the right direction. It has now been a year and a half since that fateful night. I'm making progress on my research and performing regularly. My adviser comes to some of my shows. A poster—featuring my photo—from my most recent performance is displayed on my adviser's office windowsill. The balance between music and research shifts at times—toward music in the week leading up to a performance, away as a grant due date nears—but pursuing both is my key to fulfillment.

Although the DNA sequence requirements for affinity are well-defined, the dynamic mechanisms that execute cognate recognition are much less resolved. To address this gap, here we examined ETS1, a paradigm developmental transcription factor, as a model for which cognate discrimination remains enigmatic. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we interrogated the DNA-binding domain of murine ETS1 alone and when bound to high-and low-affinity cognate sites or to nonspecific DNA. The results of our analyses revealed collective backbone and side-chain motions that distinguished cognate versus nonspecific as well as high- versus low-affinity cognate DNA binding. Combined with binding experiments with site-directed ETS1 mutants, the molecular dynamics data disclosed a triad of residues that respond specifically to low-affinity cognate DNA. We found that a DNA-contacting residue (Gln-336) specifically recognizes low-affinity DNA and triggers the loss of a distal salt bridge (Glu-343/Arg-378) via a large side-chain motion that compromises the hydrophobic packing of two core helices. As an intact Glu-343/Arg-378 bridge is the default state in unbound ETS1 and maintained in high-affinity and nonspecific complexes, the low-affinity complex represents a unique conformational adaptation to the suboptimization of developmental enhancers.

https://openalex.org/W2943432233,"Defoliation and light competition are ubiquitous stressors that can strongly limit plant performance. Tolerance to defoliation is often associated with compensatory growth, which could be positively or negatively related to plant growth. Genetic variation in growth, tolerance and compensation, in turn, plays an important role in the evolutionary adaptation of plants to changing disturbance regimes but this issue has been poorly investigated for long-lived woody species. We quantified genetic variation in plant growth and growth parameters, tolerance to defoliation and compensation for a population of the understorey palm Chamaedorea elegans. In addition, we evaluated genetic correlations between growth and tolerance/compensation.We performed a greenhouse experiment with 711 seedlings from 43 families with twelve or more individuals of C. elegans. Seeds were collected in southeast Mexico within a 0.7 ha natural forest area. A two-third defoliation treatment (repeated every two months) was applied to half of the individuals to simulate leaf loss. Compensatory responses in specific leaf area, biomass allocation to leaves and growth per unit leaf area were quantified using iterative growth models.We found that growth rate was highly heritable and that plants compensated strongly for leaf loss. However, genetic variation in tolerance, compensation, and the individual compensatory responses was low. We found strong correlations between family mean growth rates in control and defoliation treatments. We did not find indications for growth-tolerance/compensation trade-offs: genetic correlation between tolerance/compensation and growth rate were not significant.The high genetic variation in growth rate, but low genetic variation in tolerance and compensation observed here suggest high ability to adapt to changes in environment that require different growth rates, but a low potential for evolutionary adaptation to changes in damage or herbivory. The strong correlations between family mean growth rates in control and defoliation treatments suggest that performance differences among families are also maintained under stress of disturbance."

Whereas real-time quantitative PCR-based method provides an accurate quantification of human cells, it does not document their specific localization. The addition of an immunofluorescence approach using human-specific antibodies recognizing engrafted human cells gives information on the localization of the human cells within the host muscle fibres, in the stem cell niche or in the interstitial space. These two combined approaches offer an accurate evaluation of human engraftment including cell number and localization and should provide a gold standard to compare results obtained either using different types of human stem cells or comparing healthy and pathological muscle stem cells between different research laboratories worldwide."

https://openalex.org/W2943367347,"Transcription factor RUNX1 and its binding partner CBFβ play a critical role in gene regulation for hematopoiesis. Mutations of RUNX1 cause ~10% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a particularly poor prognosis. The current paradigm for the leukemogenesis is that insufficient activity of wild-type (WT) RUNX1 impairs hematopoietic differentiation. The majority of mutant RUNX1 proteins lose the DNA-binding affinity and inhibit WT RUNX1 by depletion of CBFβ. Here, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to quantitatively study the interactions of WT and three clinical mutant RUNX1, CBFβ and DNA. Our data show that the binding of RUNX1 to DNA is enthalpy-driven, and the affinity decreases in the order of WT > S114L > R139Q >> K83E, which support previous observations and conclusion. To find potentially beneficial RUNX1 mutations that could increase the overall RUNX1 activity, K83R and H179K mutations of RUNX1 were designed, using structure-based computational modeling, and found to possess significantly higher DNA-binding affinities than does WT RUNX1. K83R and H179K mutant RUNX1 could therefore be protein-based RUNX1 activators."
