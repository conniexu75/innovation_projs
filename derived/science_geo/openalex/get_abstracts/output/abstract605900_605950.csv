https://openalex.org/W2793168889,"The effect of a pollutant on the base of the food web can have knock-on effects for trophic structure and ecosystem functioning. In this study we assess the effect of microplastic exposure on juveniles of a planktivorous fish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus), a species that is widespread and abundant on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Under five different plastic concentration treatments, with plastics the same size as the natural food particles (mean 2mm diameter), there was no significant effect of plastic exposure on fish growth, body condition or behaviour. The amount of plastics found in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract was low, with a range of one to eight particles remaining in the gut of individual fish at the end of a 6-week plastic-exposure period, suggesting that these fish are able to detect and avoid ingesting microplastics in this size range. However, in a second experiment the number of plastics in the GI tract vastly increased when plastic particle size was reduced to approximately one quarter the size of the food particles, with a maximum of 2102 small (< 300μm diameter) particles present in the gut of individual fish after a 1-week plastic exposure period. Under conditions where food was replaced by plastic, there was a negative effect on the growth and body condition of the fish. These results suggest plastics could become more of a problem as they break up into smaller size classes, and that environmental changes that lead to a decrease in plankton concentrations combined with microplastic presence is likely have a greater influence on fish populations than microplastic presence alone."
https://openalex.org/W2791159669,"In this study, we investigated the effects of different lead (Pb) concentrations (0, 200, 600, 1000, 1400 mg kg-1 soil) on the growth, ion enrichment in the tissues, photosynthetic and physiological characteristics, and cellular structures of privet seedlings. We observed that with the increase in the concentrations of Pb, the growth of privet seedlings was restricted, and the level of Pb ion increased in the roots, stem, and leaves of the seedlings; however, most of the ions were concentrated in the roots. Moreover, a decreasing trend was observed for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, net photosynthesis (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Gs), sub-stomatal CO2 concentration (Ci), maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), photochemical quenching (qP), and quantum efficiency of photosystem II (ΦPSII). In contrast, the carotene levels, minimum fluorescence (F0), and non-photochemical quenching (qN) showed an increasing trend. Under Pb stress, the chloroplasts were swollen and deformed, and the thylakoid lamellae were gradually expanded, resulting in separation from the cell wall and eventual shrinkage of the nucleus. Using multiple linear regression analysis, we found that the content of Pb in the leaves exerted the maximum effect on the seedling growth. We observed that the decrease in photosynthetic activation energy, increase in pressure because of the excess activation energy, and decrease in the transpiration rate could result in maximum effect on the photosynthetic abilities of the seedlings under Pb stress. Our results should help in better understanding of the effects of heavy metals on plants and in assessing their potential for use in bioremediation."
https://openalex.org/W2789494826,"Audio recordings of the environment are an increasingly important technique to monitor biodiversity and ecosystem function. While the acquisition of long-duration recordings is becoming easier and cheaper, the analysis and interpretation of that audio remains a significant research area. The issue addressed in this paper is the automated reduction of environmental audio data to facilitate ecological investigations. We describe a method that first reduces environmental audio to vectors of acoustic indices, which are then clustered. This can reduce the audio data by six to eight orders of magnitude yet retain useful ecological information. We describe techniques to visualise sequences of cluster occurrence (using for example, diel plots, rose plots) that assist interpretation of environmental audio. Colour coding acoustic clusters allows months and years of audio data to be visualised in a single image. These techniques are useful in identifying and indexing the contents of long-duration audio recordings. They could also play an important role in monitoring long-term changes in species abundance brought about by habitat degradation and/or restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2791696954,"Lymph node stage prior to treatment is strongly related to disease progression and poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, few studies have investigated metabolic imaging features derived from pre-radiotherapy 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) of metastatic hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs). We hypothesized that these would provide complementary prognostic information to FDG-PET descriptors to only the primary tumor (tumor).Two independent cohorts of 262 and 50 node-positive NSCLC patients were used for model development and validation. Image features (i.e. Radiomics) including shape and size, first order statistics, texture, and intensity-volume histograms (IVH) (http://www.radiomics.io/) were evaluated by univariable Cox regression on the development cohort. Prognostic modeling was conducted with a 10-fold cross-validated least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), automatically selecting amongst FDG-PET-Radiomics descriptors from (1) tumor, (2) LNs or (3) both structures. Performance was assessed with the concordance-index. Development data are publicly available at www.cancerdata.org and Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.752153b).Common SUV descriptors (maximum, peak, and mean) were significantly related to overall survival when extracted from LNs, as were LN volume and tumor load (summed tumor and LNs' volumes), though this was not true for either SUV metrics or tumor's volume. Feature selection exclusively from imaging information based on FDG-PET-Radiomics, exhibited performances of (1) 0.53 -external 0.54, when derived from the tumor, (2) 0.62 -external 0.56 from LNs, and (3) 0.62 -external 0.59 from both structures, including at least one feature from each sub-category, except IVH.Combining imaging information based on FDG-PET-Radiomics features from tumors and LNs is desirable to achieve a higher prognostic discriminative power for NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2789684415,"A major challenge for coral reef conservation and management is understanding how a wide range of interacting human and natural drivers cumulatively impact and shape these ecosystems. Despite the importance of understanding these interactions, a methodological framework to synthesize spatially explicit data of such drivers is lacking. To fill this gap, we established a transferable data synthesis methodology to integrate spatial data on environmental and anthropogenic drivers of coral reefs, and applied this methodology to a case study location-the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). Environmental drivers were derived from time series (2002-2013) of climatological ranges and anomalies of remotely sensed sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, irradiance, and wave power. Anthropogenic drivers were characterized using empirically derived and modeled datasets of spatial fisheries catch, sedimentation, nutrient input, new development, habitat modification, and invasive species. Within our case study system, resulting driver maps showed high spatial heterogeneity across the MHI, with anthropogenic drivers generally greatest and most widespread on O'ahu, where 70% of the state's population resides, while sedimentation and nutrients were dominant in less populated islands. Together, the spatial integration of environmental and anthropogenic driver data described here provides a first-ever synthetic approach to visualize how the drivers of coral reef state vary in space and demonstrates a methodological framework for implementation of this approach in other regions of the world. By quantifying and synthesizing spatial drivers of change on coral reefs, we provide an avenue for further research to understand how drivers determine reef diversity and resilience, which can ultimately inform policies to protect coral reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2789933925,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a conserved ligand-activated transcription factor required for proper vertebrate development and homeostasis. The inappropriate activation of AHR by ubiquitous pollutants can lead to adverse effects on wildlife and human health. The zebrafish is a powerful model system that provides a vertebrate data stream that anchors hypothesis at the genetic and cellular levels to observations at the morphological and behavioral level, in a high-throughput format. In order to investigate the endogenous functions of AHR, we generated an AHR2 (homolog of human AHR)-null zebrafish line (ahr2osu1) using the clustered, regulatory interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 precision genome editing method. In zebrafish, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) mediated toxicity requires AHR2. The AHR2-null line was resistant to TCDD-induced toxicity, indicating the line can be used to investigate the biological and toxicological functions of AHR2. The AHR2-null zebrafish exhibited decreased survival and fecundity compared to the wild type line. At 36 weeks, histological evaluations of the AHR2-null ovaries revealed a reduction of mature follicles when compared to wild type ovaries, suggesting AHR2 regulates follicle growth in zebrafish. AHR2-null adults had malformed cranial skeletal bones and severely damaged fins. Our data suggests AHR2 regulates some aspect(s) of neuromuscular and/or sensory system development, with impaired behavioral responses observed in larval and adult AHR2-null zebrafish. This study increases our understanding of the endogenous functions of AHR, which may help foster a better understanding of the target organs and molecular mechanisms involved in AHR-mediated toxicities."
https://openalex.org/W2794039702,"Globally, the majority of persons born with sickle cell disease do not have access to hydroxyurea or more expensive interventions. The objectives were to estimate the survival in homozygous sickle cell disease, unbiased by symptomatic selection and to ascertain the causes of death in a pre-hydroxyurea population. The utility of early life biomarkers and genetically determined phenotypes to predict survival was assessed. A cohort study based on neonatal diagnosis was undertaken at the Sickle Cell Unit, a specialist clinic delivering care to persons with sickle cell disease in Jamaica. Screening of 100,000 deliveries detected 315 babies with homozygous sickle cell disease of whom 311 have been followed from birth for periods up to 43 years. Pneumococcal prophylaxis and teaching mothers splenic palpation were important, inexpensive interventions. Anticipatory guidance, routine care and out-patient acute care were provided. Each participant was classified as alive, dead, or defaulted (usually emigration). Causes of death were ascertained from clinical records and/or post-mortem reports. Survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier function. Sex-adjusted Cox semi-parametric proportional hazards and Weibull modelling were used to assess the effects on survival of biomarkers. Survival to 40 years was 55.5% (95% CI 48.7% to 61.7%). Acute Chest Syndrome (n = 31) and septicemia (n = 14) were significant causes of death at all ages. Acute splenic sequestration (n = 12) was the most common cause of early deaths. Survival was significantly shorter in those with lower hemoglobin at 1 year, high total nucleated count at 1 year, and a history of dactylitis ever. In these hydroxyurea naïve patients, survival into midlife was common. Causes of death were often age specific and some may be preventable. Early life biomarkers predictive of decreased survival in SS disease identify a patient group likely to benefit from close clinical supervision and potentially high risk therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2776595964,"Cellphones equipped with high-quality cameras and powerful CPUs as well as GPUs are widespread. This opens new prospects to use such existing computational and imaging resources to perform medical diagnosis in developing countries at a very low cost. Many relevant samples, like biological cells or waterborn parasites, are almost fully transparent. As they do not exhibit absorption, but alter the light’s phase only, they are almost invisible in brightfield microscopy. Expensive equipment and procedures for microscopic contrasting or sample staining often are not available. Dedicated illumination approaches, tailored to the sample under investigation help to boost the contrast. This is achieved by a programmable illumination source, which also allows to measure the phase gradient using the differential phase contrast (DPC) [1, 2] or even the quantitative phase using the derived qDPC approach [3]. By applying machine-learning techniques, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), it is possible to learn a relationship between samples to be examined and its optimal light source shapes, in order to increase e.g. phase contrast, from a given dataset to enable real-time applications. For the experimental setup, we developed a 3D-printed smartphone microscope for less than 100 $ using off-the-shelf components only such as a low-cost video projector. The fully automated system assures true Koehler illumination with an LCD as the condenser aperture and a reversed smartphone lens as the microscope objective. We show that the effect of a varied light source shape, using the pre-trained CNN, does not only improve the phase contrast, but also the impression of an improvement in optical resolution without adding any special optics, as demonstrated by measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2793168635,"This study aims to reveal the runoff variation characteristics of long time series in a karst region, analyse comprehensively its different driving factors, and estimate quantitatively the contribution rates of climate change and human activities to net runoff variation. Liudong river basin, a typical karst watershed in southwest China, is the study site. Statistical methods, such as linear fitting, the Morlet wavelet analysis, normalized curve and double mass curve, are applied to analyse the runoff of the watershed. Results show that the runoff in the karst watershed during the research period exhibits a three-stage change and the abrupt change points are the years 1981 and 2007: (1) 1968-1980, the runoff initially exhibited a trend of sustained decreasing and then an abrupt fluctuation. The runoff was obviously destroyed through precipitation-producing processes. Improper land utilisation and serious forest and grass destruction intensified the fluctuation variation amplitude of the runoff. (2) 1981-2006, the changing processes of runoff and precipitation exhibited good synchronism. Precipitation significantly affected runoff variation and human activities had a slight interference degree. (3) 2007-2013, the fluctuation range of runoff was considerably smaller than that of precipitation. The significant growth of forest and grassland areas and the increase in water consumption mitigated runoff fluctuation and greatly diminished runoff variation amplitude. According to calculation, the relative contribution rates of precipitation and human activities to net runoff variation with 1981-2007 as the reference period were -81% and 181% in average, respectively, during 1968-1980, and -117% and 217% in average, respectively, during 2007-2013. In general, the analysis of runoff variation trend and of the contribution rate of its main influencing factors in the typical karst watershed for nearly half a century may be significant to solve the drought problem in the karst region and for the sustainable development of the drainage basin."
https://openalex.org/W2790361591,"Deregulation of mitochondrial morphogenesis, a dynamic equilibrium between mitochondrial fusion and fission processes, is now evolving as a key metabolic event that fuels tumor growth and therapy resistance. However, fundamental knowledge underpinning how cancer cells reprogram mitochondrial morphogenesis remains incomplete. Here, we report that cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) reprograms mitochondrial morphogenesis in ovarian cancer (OvCa) cells by selectively regulating the stability of mitofusin 2 (MFN2). Clinically, high expression of both CBS and MFN2 implicates poor overall survival of OvCa patients, and a significant association between CBS and MFN2 expression exists in individual patients in the same data set. The silencing of CBS by small interfering RNA or inhibition of its catalytic activity by a small molecule inhibitor creates oxidative stress that activates JNK. Activated JNK phosphorylates MFN2 to recruit homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus' domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase for its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Supplementation with hydrogen sulfide or glutathione (the catalytic products of CBS enzymatic activity), anti-oxidants, or a JNK inhibitor restores MFN2 expression. In CBS-silenced orthotopic xenograft tumor tissues, MFN2 but not MFN1 is selectively downregulated. In summary, this report reveals a role for deregulated mitochondrial morphogenesis in OvCa, suggests one of the mechanisms for this deregulation, and provides a way to correct it through modulation of the metabolic enzyme CBS.-Chakraborty, P.

https://openalex.org/W2789710373,"The thrombin-induced polymerisation of fibrinogen to form fibrin is well established as a late stage of blood clotting. It is known that Parkinson's Disease (PD) is accompanied by dysregulation in blood clotting, but it is less widely known as a coagulopathy. In recent work, we showed that the presence of tiny amounts of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in healthy individuals could cause clots to adopt an amyloid form, and this could be observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or via the fluorescence of thioflavin-T. This could be prevented by the prior addition of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). We had also observed by SEM this unusual clotting in the blood of patients with Parkinson's Disease. We hypothesised, and here show, that this too can be prevented by LBP in the context of PD. This adds further evidence implicating inflammatory microbial cell wall products as an accompaniment to the disease, and may be part of its aetiology. This may lead to novel treatment strategies in PD designed to target microbes and their products."
https://openalex.org/W2790011675,"In the present work, a novel infrared-assisted extraction coupled to headspace solid-phase microextraction (IRAE-HS-SPME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed for rapid determination of the volatile components in green tea. The extraction parameters such as fiber type, sample amount, infrared power, extraction time, and infrared lamp distance were optimized by orthogonal experimental design. Under optimum conditions, a total of 82 volatile compounds in 21 green tea samples from different geographical origins were identified. Compared with classical water-bath heating, the proposed technique has remarkable advantages of considerably reducing the analytical time and high efficiency. In addition, an effective classification of green teas based on their volatile profiles was achieved by partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). Furthermore, the application of a dual criterion based on the variable importance in the projection (VIP) values of the PLS-DA models and on the category from one-way univariate analysis (ANOVA) allowed the identification of 12 potential volatile markers, which were considered to make the most important contribution to the discrimination of the samples. The results suggest that IRAE-HS-SPME/GC-MS technique combined with multivariate analysis offers a valuable tool to assess geographical traceability of different tea varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2793560365,"Advances in recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that pleiotropic effects on human complex traits are widespread. A number of classic and recent meta-analysis methods have been used to identify genetic loci with pleiotropic effects, but the overall performance of these methods is not well understood. In this work, we use extensive simulations and case studies of GWAS datasets to investigate the power and type-I error rates of ten meta-analysis methods. We specifically focus on three conditions commonly encountered in the studies of multiple traits: (1) extensive heterogeneity of genetic effects; (2) characterization of trait-specific association; and (3) inflated correlation of GWAS due to overlapping samples. Although the statistical power is highly variable under distinct study conditions, we found the superior power of several methods under diverse heterogeneity. In particular, classic fixed-effects model showed surprisingly good performance when a variant is associated with more than a half of study traits. As the number of traits with null effects increases, ASSET performed the best along with competitive specificity and sensitivity. With opposite directional effects, CPASSOC featured the first-rate power. However, caution is advised when using CPASSOC for studying genetically correlated traits with overlapping samples. We conclude with a discussion of unresolved issues and directions for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2789767914,"Background Conventional gold standard characterization of chigger mites involves chemical preparation procedures (i.e. specimen clearing) for visualization of morphological features, which however contributes to destruction of the arthropod host DNA and any endosymbiont or pathogen DNA harbored within the specimen. Methodology/Principal findings In this study, a novel work flow based on autofluorescence microscopy was developed to enable identification of trombiculid mites to the species level on the basis of morphological traits without any special preparation, while preserving the mite DNA for subsequent genotyping. A panel of 16 specifically selected fluorescence microscopy images of mite features from available identification keys served for complete chigger morphological identification to the species level, and was paired with corresponding genotype data. We evaluated and validated this method for paired chigger morphological and genotypic ID using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (coi) in 113 chigger specimens representing 12 species and 7 genera (Leptotrombidium, Ascoschoengastia, Gahrliepia, Walchia, Blankaartia, Schoengastia and Schoutedenichia) from the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) to the species level (complete characterization), and 153 chiggers from 5 genera (Leptotrombidium, Ascoschoengastia, Helenicula, Schoengastiella and Walchia) from Thailand, Cambodia and Lao PDR to the genus level. A phylogenetic tree constructed from 77 coi gene sequences (approximately 640 bp length, n = 52 new coi sequences and n = 25 downloaded from GenBank), demonstrated clear grouping of assigned morphotypes at the genus levels, although evidence of both genetic polymorphism and morphological plasticity was found. Conclusions/Significance With this new methodology, we provided the largest collection of characterized coi gene sequences for trombiculid mites to date, and almost doubled the number of available characterized coi gene sequences with a single study. The ability to provide paired phenotypic-genotypic data is of central importance for future characterization of mites and dissecting the molecular epidemiology of mites transmitting diseases like scrub typhus."
https://openalex.org/W2786633371,"Political campaigns involve, in the simplest case, two competing campaign groups which try to obtain a majority of votes. We propose a novel mathematical framework to study political campaign dynamics on social networks whose constituents are either political activists or persuadable individuals. Activists are convinced and do not change their opinion and they are able to move around in the social network to motivate persuadable individuals to vote according to their opinion. We describe the influence of the complex interplay between the number of activists, political clout, budgets, and campaign costs on the campaign result. We also identify situations where the choice of one campaign group to send a certain number of activists already pre-determines their victory. Moreover, we show that a candidate's advantage in terms of political clout can overcome a substantial budget disadvantage or a lower number of activists, as illustrated by the US presidential election 2016."
https://openalex.org/W2790317461,"In Northern Ghana, 33% of children are stunted due to economic disparities. Dietary fatty acids (FA) are critical for growth, but whether blood FA levels are adequate in Ghanaian children is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the association between whole blood FAs and growth parameters in Northern Ghanaian children 2–6 years of age. A drop of blood was collected on an antioxidant treated card and analyzed for FA composition. Weight and height were measured and z-scores were calculated. Relationships between FAs and growth parameters were analyzed by Spearman correlations, linear regressions, and factor analysis. Of the 307 children who participated, 29.7% were stunted and 8% were essential FA deficient (triene/tetraene ratio>0.02). Essential FA did not differ between stunted and non-stunted children and was not associated with height-for-age z-score (HAZ) or weight-for-age z-score (WAZ). In hemoglobin adjusted regression models, both HAZ and WAZ were positively associated with arachidonic acid (p≤0.01), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA, p≤0.05), docosatetraenoic acid (p≤0.01) and the ratio of DGLA/linoleic acid (p≤0.01). These data add to the growing body of evidence indicating n-6 FAs are critical in childhood linear growth. Our findings provide new insights into the health status of an understudied Northern Ghanaian population."
https://openalex.org/W2790366821,"Objective To examine the effects of socioecological factors on multiple communicable diseases across Vietnam. Methods We used the Moran’s I tests to evaluate spatial clusters of diseases and applied multilevel negative binomial regression models using the Bayesian framework to analyse the association between socioecological factors and the diseases queried by oral, airborne, vector-borne, and animal transmission diseases. Results and significance The study found that oral-transmission diseases were spatially distributed across the country; whereas, the airborne-transmission diseases were more clustered in the Northwest and vector-borne transmission diseases were more clustered in the South. Most of diseases were sensitive with climatic factors. For instance, a 1°C increase in average temperature is significantly associated with 0.4% (95CI, 0.3–0.5), 2.5% (95%CI, 1.4–3.6), 0.9% (95%CI, 0.6–1.4), 1.1% (95%CI), 5% (95%CI, 3-.7.4), 0.4% (95%CI, 0.2–0.7), and 2% (95%CI, 1.5–2.8) increase in risk of diarrhoea, shigellosis, mumps, influenza, dengue, malaria, and rabies respectively. The influences of socio-economic factors on risk of communicable diseases are varied by factors with the biggest influence of population density. The research findings reflect an important implication for the climate change adaptation strategies of health sectors. A development of weather-based early warning systems should be considered to strengthen communicable disease prevention in Vietnam."
https://openalex.org/W2790897232,"We prospectively examined the variability of non-Gaussian diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) measurements with different numbers of b-values and excitations in normal breast tissue and breast lesions. Thirteen volunteers and fourteen patients with breast lesions (seven malignant, eight benign; one patient had bilateral lesions) were recruited in this prospective study (approved by the Internal Review Board). Diffusion-weighted MRI was performed with 16 b-values (0–2500 s/mm2 with one number of excitations [NEX]) and five b-values (0–2500 s/mm2, 3 NEX), using a 3T breast MRI. Intravoxel incoherent motion (flowing blood volume fraction [fIVIM] and pseudodiffusion coefficient [D*]) and non-Gaussian diffusion (theoretical apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] at b value of 0 sec/mm2 [ADC0] and kurtosis [K]) parameters were estimated from IVIM and Kurtosis models using 16 b-values, and synthetic apparent diffusion coefficient (sADC) values were obtained from two key b-values. The variabilities between and within subjects and between different diffusion acquisition methods were estimated. There were no statistical differences in ADC0, K, or sADC values between the different b-values or NEX. A good agreement of diffusion parameters was observed between 16 b-values (one NEX), five b-values (one NEX), and five b-values (three NEX) in normal breast tissue or breast lesions. Insufficient agreement was observed for IVIM parameters. There were no statistical differences in the non-Gaussian diffusion MRI estimated values obtained from a different number of b-values or excitations in normal breast tissue or breast lesions. These data suggest that a limited MRI protocol using a few b-values might be relevant in a clinical setting for the estimation of non-Gaussian diffusion MRI parameters in normal breast tissue and breast lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2791435078,"Reverse Transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a technique for gene expression profiling with high sensibility and reproducibility. However, to obtain accurate results, it depends on data normalization by using endogenous reference genes whose expression is constitutive or invariable. Although the technique is widely used in plant stress analyzes, the stability of reference genes for iron toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we tested a set of candidate reference genes for use in rice under this stressful condition. The test was performed using four distinct methods: NormFinder, BestKeeper, geNorm and the comparative ΔCt. To achieve reproducible and reliable results, Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines were followed. Valid reference genes were found for shoot (P2, OsGAPDH and OsNABP), root (OsEF-1a, P8 and OsGAPDH) and root+shoot (OsNABP, OsGAPDH and P8) enabling us to perform further reliable studies for iron toxicity in both indica and japonica subspecies. The importance of the study of other than the traditional endogenous genes for use as normalizers is also shown here."

However, the relation between organizational socialization and OCBI has received little attention. This study tests the validity of a moderated mediation model in which we examine the mediating effect of a decreased interpersonal strain on the relationship between organizational socialization and OCBI, and the moderation role of a positive personal resource in reducing interpersonal strain when an unsuccessful socialization subsists. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 765 new recruits of the Guardia di Finanza-a military Police Force reporting to the Italian Minister of Economy. Findings confirm our hypothesis that interpersonal strain mediates the relationship between organizational socialization and OCBI. The index of moderated mediation results significant, showing that this effect exists at different levels of positivity. Theoretical and practical implications for promoting pro-organizational behaviors are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2793721491,"The PUREX technology based on aqueous processes is currently the leading reprocessing technology in nuclear energy systems. It seems to be the most developed and established process for light water reactor fuel and the use of solid fuel. However, demand driven development of the nuclear system opens the way to liquid fuelled reactors, and disruptive technology development through the application of an integrated fuel cycle with a direct link to reactor operation. The possibilities of this new concept for innovative reprocessing technology development are analysed, the boundary conditions are discussed, and the economic as well as the neutron physical optimization parameters of the process are elucidated. Reactor physical knowledge of the influence of different elements on the neutron economy of the reactor is required. Using an innovative study approach, an element priority list for the salt clean-up is developed, which indicates that separation of Neodymium and Caesium is desirable, as they contribute almost 50% to the loss of criticality. Separating Zirconium and Samarium in addition from the fuel salt would remove nearly 80% of the loss of criticality due to fission products. The theoretical study is followed by a qualitative discussion of the different, demand driven optimization strategies which could satisfy the conflicting interests of sustainable reactor operation, efficient chemical processing for the salt clean-up, and the related economic as well as chemical engineering consequences. A new, innovative approach of balancing the throughput through salt processing based on a low number of separation process steps is developed. Next steps for the development of an economically viable salt clean-up process are identified."
https://openalex.org/W2793742498,"Oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) was identified as a contaminant in certain heparin preparations as the cause of adverse reactions in patients. OSCS was found to possess both plasma anticoagulant activity and the ability to activate prekallikrein to kallikrein. Differentially sulfated chondroitin sulfates were prepared by synthetic modification of chondroitin sulfate and were compared to the activity of OSCS purified from contaminated heparin. Whilst chondroitin sulfate was found to have minimal anticoagulant activity, increasing sulfation levels produced an anticoagulant response which we directly show for the first time is mediated through heparin cofactor II. However, the tetra-sulfated preparations did not possess any higher anticoagulant activity than several tri-sulfated variants, and also had lower heparin cofactor II mediated activity. Activation of prekallikrein was concentration dependent for all samples, and broadly increased with the degree of sulfation, though the di-sulfated preparation was able to form more kallikrein than some of the tri-sulfated preparations. The ability of the samples to activate the kinin system, as measured by bradykinin, was observed to be through kallikrein generation. These results show that whilst an increase in sulfation of chondroitin sulfate did cause an increase in anticoagulant activity and activation of the kinin system, there may be subtler structural interactions other than sulfation at play given the different responses observed."
https://openalex.org/W2794406192,"Bulk tissue samples examined by gene expression studies are usually heterogeneous. The data gained from these samples display the confounding patterns of mixtures consisting of multiple cell types or similar cell types in various functional states, which hinders the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex biological phenomena. A realistic approach to compensate for the limitations of experimentally separating homogenous cell populations from mixed tissues is to computationally identify cell-type specific patterns from bulk, heterogeneous measurements. We designed the CellDistinguisher algorithm to analyze the gene expression data of mixed samples, identifying genes that best distinguish biological processes and cell types. Coupled with a deconvolution algorithm that takes cell type specific gene lists as input, we show that CellDistinguisher performs as well as partial deconvolution algorithms in predicting cell type composition without the need for prior knowledge of cell type signatures. This approach is also better in predicting cell type signatures than the one-step traditional complete deconvolution methods. To illustrate its wide applicability, the algorithm was tested on multiple publicly available data sets. In each case, CellDistinguisher identified genes reflecting biological processes typical for the tissues and development stages of interest and estimated the sample compositions accurately."

The suggested ANN model comprises three modules: the data preparation module, the feature selection module, and the forecast module. The first module applies pre-processing to make the data compatible for the feature selection module. The second module discards irrelevant and redundant data from the input set. The third module uses ANN for prediction. The ANN model applies a sigmoid activation function and a multi-variate auto regressive model to update the weights during the training process. In this work, the refractivity is predicted and estimated based on ten years (2002-2011) of meteorological data, such as the temperature, pressure, and humidity, obtained from the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Islamabad. The refractivity is estimated using the method suggested by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The refractivity is predicted for the year 2012 using the database of the previous ten years, with the help of ANN. The ANN model is implemented in MATLAB. Next, the estimated and predicted refractivity levels are validated against each other. The predicted and actual values (PMD data) of the atmospheric parameters agree with each other well, and demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed ANN method. It was further found that all parameters have a strong relationship with refractivity, in particular the temperature and humidity. The refractivity values are higher during the rainy season owing to a strong association with the relative humidity. Therefore, it is important to properly cater the signal communication system during hot and humid weather. Based on the results, the proposed ANN method can be used to develop a refractivity database, which is highly important in a radio communication system."
https://openalex.org/W2790893122,"Feast-famine cycles in biological wastewater resource recovery systems select for bacterial species that accumulate intracellular storage compounds such as poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), glycogen, and triacylglycerols (TAG). These species survive better the famine phase and resume rapid substrate uptake at the beginning of the feast phase faster than microorganisms unable to accumulate storage. However, ecophysiological conditions favouring the accumulation of either storage compounds remain to be clarified, and predictive capabilities need to be developed to eventually rationally design reactors producing these compounds. Using a genome-scale metabolic modelling approach, the storage metabolism of Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 was investigated for steady-state feast-famine cycles on glucose and acetate as the sole carbon sources. R. jostii RHA1 is capable of accumulating the three storage compounds (PHB, TAG, and glycogen) simultaneously. According to the experimental observations, when glucose was the substrate, feast phase chemical oxygen demand (COD) accumulation was similar for the three storage compounds; when acetate was the substrate, however, PHB accumulation was 3 times higher than TAG accumulation and essentially no glycogen was accumulated. These results were simulated using the genome-scale metabolic model of R. jostii RHA1 (iMT1174) by means of flux balance analysis (FBA) to determine the objective functions capable of predicting these behaviours. Maximization of the growth rate was set as the main objective function, while minimization of total reaction fluxes and minimization of metabolic adjustment (environmental MOMA) were considered as the sub-objective functions. The environmental MOMA sub-objective performed better than the minimization of total reaction fluxes sub-objective function at predicting the mixture of storage compounds accumulated. Additional experiments with 13C-labelled bicarbonate (HCO3−) found that the fluxes through the central metabolism reactions during the feast phases were similar to the ones during the famine phases on acetate due to similarity in the carbon sources in the feast and famine phases (i.e., acetate and poly-β-hydroxybutyrate, respectively); this suggests that the environmental MOMA sub-objective function could be used to analyze successive environmental conditions such as the feast and famine cycles while the metabolically similar carbon sources are taken up by microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2790547369,"Acute and sustained soluble dietary fibre (SDF) consumption are both associated with improved glucose tolerance in humans and animal models (e.g. porcine). However, the effects on glucose tolerance in grower pigs, adapted to diets with a combination of SDF have not been studied previously. In this experiment, cereal SDF wheat arabinoxylan (AX) and oat β-glucan (BG) were fed individually and in combination to determine the effect on glucose tolerance in jugular vein catheterized grower pigs. Five groups of Large White male grower pigs were fed highly digestible diets containing either 10% AX, 10% BG, 5% AX with 5% BG, a model cereal whole wheat flour (WWF), or a control wheat starch diet (WS) with no SDF. Blood was collected via jugular vein catheters over 240 minutes following a feed challenge and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on two separate days. Postprandial blood samples were used to determine plasma glucose, insulin, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), ghrelin, glucagon and cortisol concentrations. No dietary effects on glycaemic response were observed following the feed challenge or the OGTT as determined by the area under the curve (AUC). A biphasic glucose and insulin response was detected for all pigs following the OGTT. The current study showed male grower pigs have tight glycaemic control and glucose tolerance regardless of diet. In addition, pigs fed the combined SDF had a reduced GIP response and delayed insulin peak following the feed challenge. Incretin (GLP-1 and GIP) secretion appeared asynchronous reflecting their different enteroendocrine cell locations and response to nutrient absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2790414003,"Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disorder caused by mutations in a protein containing both a DNA exonuclease and DNA helicase domain. Mice lacking the helicase domain of the Wrn protein orthologue exhibit transcriptomic and metabolic alterations, some of which are reversed by vitamin C. Recent studies on these animals indicated that the mutant protein is associated with enriched endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fractions of tissues resulting in an ER stress response. In this study, we identified proteins that exhibit actual level differences in the ER enriched fraction between the liver of wild type and Wrn mutant mice using quantitative proteomic profiling with label-free Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) and immunoblotting were performed to validate findings in a secondary independent cohort of wild type and Wrn mutant mice. DAVID 6.7 (NIH) was used for functional annotation analysis and indicated that the identified proteins exhibiting level changes between untreated wild type, Wrn mutant, and vitamin C treated Wrn mutant mice (ANOVA P-value < 0.05) were involved in fatty acid and steroid metabolism pathways (Bonferroni P-value = 0.0137). Finally, when we compared the transcriptomic and the proteomic data of our mouse cohorts only ~7% of the altered mRNA profiles encoding for ER gene products were consistent with their corresponding protein profiles measured by the label-free quantification methods. These results suggest that a great number of ER gene products are regulated at the post-transcriptional level in the liver of Wrn mutant mice exhibiting an ER stress response."
https://openalex.org/W2791644510,"Electrical restitution (ER) is a major determinant of repolarization stability and, under fast pacing rate, it reveals memory properties of the cardiac action potential (AP), whose dynamics have never been fully elucidated, nor their ionic mechanisms. Previous studies have looked at ER mainly in terms of changes in AP duration (APD) when the preceding diastolic interval (DI) changes and described dynamic conditions where this relationship shows hysteresis which, in turn, has been proposed as a marker of short-term AP memory and repolarization stability. By means of numerical simulations of a non-propagated human ventricular AP, we show here that measuring ER as APD versus the preceding cycle length (CL) provides additional information on repolarization dynamics which is not contained in the companion formulation. We focus particularly on fast pacing rate conditions with a beat-to-beat variable CL, where memory properties emerge from APD vs CL and not from APD vs DI and should thus be stored in APD and not in DI. We provide an ion-currents characterization of such conditions under periodic and random CL variability, and show that the memory stored in APD plays a stabilizing role on AP repolarization under pacing rate perturbations. The gating kinetics of L-type calcium current seems to be the main determinant of this safety mechanism. We also show that, at fast pacing rate and under otherwise identical pacing conditions, a periodically beat-to-beat changing CL is more effective than a random one in stabilizing repolarization. In summary, we propose a novel view of short-term AP memory, differentially stored between systole and diastole, which opens a number of methodological and theoretical implications for the understanding of arrhythmia development."
https://openalex.org/W2793436794,"In many taxa, individual social traits appear to be consistent across time and context, thus meeting the criteria for animal personality. How these differences are maintained in response to changes in population density is unknown, particularly in large mammals, such as ungulates. Using a behavioral reaction norm (BRN) framework, we examined how among- and within-individual variation in social connectedness, measured using social network analyses, change as a function of population density. We studied a captive herd of elk (Cervus canadensis) separated into a group of male elk and a group of female elk. Males and females were exposed to three different density treatments and we recorded social associations between individuals with proximity-detecting radio-collars fitted to elk. We constructed social networks using dyadic association data and calculated three social network metrics reflective of social connectedness: eigenvector centrality, graph strength, and degree. Elk exhibited consistent individual differences in social connectedness across densities; however, they showed little individual variation in their response to changes in density, i.e., individuals oftentimes responded plastically, but in the same manner to changes in density. Female elk had highest connectedness at an intermediate density. In contrast, male elk increased connectedness with increasing density. Whereas this may suggest that the benefits of social connectedness outweigh the costs of increased competition at higher density for males, females appear to exhibit a threshold in social benefits (e.g. predator detection and forage information). Our study illustrates the importance of viewing social connectedness as a density-dependent trait, particularly in the context of plasticity. Moreover, we highlight the need to revisit our understanding of density dependence as a population-level phenomenon by accounting for consistent individual differences not only in social connectedness, but likely in other ecological processes (e.g., predator-prey dynamics, mate choice, disease transfer)."
https://openalex.org/W2791668549,"Aim Among the three adiponectin isoforms, a lower ratio of high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin to total adiponectin (TA) is well known to cause insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, how the levels of other adiponectin isoforms, such as the middle molecular weight (MMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) isoforms, and their relative ratio to TA change in T2D subjects has not been determined. Therefore, we investigated the association of these adiponectin-related parameters with T2D. Methods We examined the associations between adiponectin-related parameters and diabetes in a group of 394 T2D subjects and 374 controls (1st group) randomly selected from among the participants in our previous study. The associations between these parameters and the HOMA-IR in a 2nd group, consisting of the subjects remaining in the 1st group after the exclusion of subjects receiving diabetic medication, were also examined. Result In the 1st group, after adjusting for confounding factor, the levels of all the adiponectin isoforms and the HMW/TA ratio were significantly lower among the diabetic subjects than among the controls (all P values < 0.01). On the contrary, the LMW/TA ratio was significantly higher among the diabetic subjects (P < 0.01) and was positively associated with T2D (odds ratio = 8.64, P < 0.01). In the 2nd group, the HMW/TA ratio was inversely associated with the HOMA-IR; however, the LMW/TA ratio was positively associated with the HOMA-IR (β for LMW/TA ratio = 0.89, SE = 0.24, P < 0.001), similar to the association with T2D. The MMW/TA ratio was not associated with T2D or the HOMA-IR. Conclusion The current investigation demonstrated that, unlike the reduction in the levels of all the adiponectin isoforms and the HMW/TA ratio, an increased LMW/TA ratio was associated with T2D through its relation to insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2794037246,"The spread and uptake of new ideas (diffusion of innovations) is critical for organizations to adapt over time, but there is little evidence of how this happens within organizations and to their broader community. To address this, we analyzed how individuals accessed information about a recent science innovation at a large, international, biodiversity conservation non-profit-The Nature Conservancy-and then traced the flow of how this information was shared within the organization and externally, drawing on an exceptionally data-rich environment. We used surveys and tracking of individual internet activity to understand mechanisms for early-stage diffusion (knowledge seeking and sharing) following the integration of social science and evidence principles into the institutional planning framework: Conservation by Design (CbD 2.0). Communications sent to all employees effectively catalyzed 56.4% to exhibit knowledge seeking behavior, measured by individual downloads from and visits to a restricted-access site. Individuals who self-reported through a survey that they shared information about CbD 2.0 internally were more likely to have both received and sought out information about the framework. Such individuals tended to hold positions within a higher job grade, were more likely to train others on CbD as part of their job, and to enroll in other online professional development offerings. Communication strategies targeting external audiences did not appear to influence information seeking behavior. Staff who engaged in internal knowledge sharing and adopting ""evidence"" practices from CbD 2.0 were more likely to have shared the document externally. We found a negative correlation with external sharing behavior and in-person trainings. Our findings suggest repeated, direct email communications aimed at wide audiences can effectively promote diffusion of new ideas. We also found a wide range of employee characteristics and circumstances to be associated with knowledge diffusion behavior (at both an organizational and individual level)."
https://openalex.org/W2790215153,"Diarrhoea among children under-five is a serious public health problem in many developing countries, including Nepal. This study aimed to examine the association between health service utilization and diarrhoea management approaches among children under-five years in Nepal.The combined 2001, 2006 and 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) data sets were examined and the sample included 2,655 children aged 0-59 months who had diarrhoea 2-weeks prior to the each survey. Multilevel logistic regression analyses that adjust for clustering and sampling weight were used to examine the association between health service utilization and diarrhoea management approaches (Oral Rehydration Solution, increased fluids and/or continued feeding).The prevalence of extra fluids decreased significantly from 27% in 2001 to 15% in 2011 while that of ORS increased significantly from 32% in 2001 to 40% in 2011. The prevalence of continued feeding fluctuated between 83-89%. Multivariate analysis revealed that caregivers whose children received treatment or advice from health care providers during diarrhoea were 5.78 times more likely to treat diarrhoea with Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 5.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.50, 7.44], 1.56 (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.19, 2.05) times more likely to offer extra fluids, and 2.25 (aOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.50, 3.39) times more likely to use continued feeding than those who did not seek advice.Our findings indicate that health service utilization significantly improves diarrhoea management among under-five children. However, a broader national diarrhoeal disease control program to further reduce diarrhoea related morbidity and mortality in Nepal should focus on educating caregivers about the importance of the use of ORS as well as increase fluid intake to children under-five years with diarrhoea."
https://openalex.org/W2791519360,"Nonlinear mixed models were used to describe longitudinal scrotal circumference (SC) measurements of Nellore bulls. Models comparisons were based on Akaike's information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, error sum of squares, adjusted R2 and percentage of convergence. Sequentially, the best model was used to compare the SC growth curve in bulls divergently classified according to SC at 18-21 months of age. For this, bulls were classified into five groups: SC < 28cm; 28cm ≤ SC < 30cm, 30cm ≤ SC < 32cm, 32cm ≤ SC < 34cm and SC ≥ 34cm. Michaelis-Menten model showed the best fit according to the mentioned criteria. In this model, β1 is the asymptotic SC value and β2 represents the time to half-final growth and may be related to sexual precocity. Parameters of the individual estimated growth curves were used to create a new dataset to evaluate the effect of the classification, farms, and year of birth on β1 and β2 parameters. Bulls of the largest SC group presented a larger predicted SC along all analyzed periods; nevertheless, smaller SC group showed predicted SC similar to intermediate SC groups (28cm ≤ SC < 32cm), around 1200 days of age. In this context, bulls classified as improper for reproduction at 18-21 months old can reach a similar condition to those considered as good condition. In terms of classification at 18-21 months, asymptotic SC was similar among groups, farms and years; however, β2 differed among groups indicating that differences in growth curves are related to sexual precocity. In summary, it seems that selection based on SC at too early ages may lead to discard bulls with suitable reproductive potential."

However, a proper model with which to study the biology of this disease and to develop therapeutics is lacking. One of the most accepted animal models for this disease uses HLA-B27/Hu-β2m transgenic rats; however, only 30%-50% of male HLA-B27/Hu-β2m rats develop spontaneous, clinically apparent spondylitis and have a variable time until disease onset. Here, we report a high-incidence, low-variation spontaneous mouse model that delineates how the combination of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-27 (IL-27) signaling deficiency and mitogenic signaling (mutant p53R172H) in vivo, leads to bone loss in the vertebral bodies and ossification of the cartilage in the intervertebral discs. In this human disease-like mouse model, bone loss and pathogenic bone development are seen as early as 4 months of age in the absence of inflammatory aggregates in the enthesis or intervertebral disc."
https://openalex.org/W2793355275,"The with no lysine (WNK) protein kinase family is conserved among many species. Some mutations in human WNK gene are associated with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, a form of hypertension, and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2A. In kidney, WNK regulates the activity of STE20/SPS1-related, proline alanine-rich kinase and/or oxidative-stress responsive 1, which in turn regulate ion co-transporters. The misregulation of this pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of pseudohypoaldosteronism type II. In the neural system, WNK is involved in the specification of the cholinergic neuron, but the pathogenesis of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2A is still unknown. To better understand the WNK pathway, we isolated WNK-associated genes using Drosophila. We identified Glycogen synthase kinase 3ß (GSK3ß)/Shaggy (Sgg) as a candidate gene that was shown to interact with the WNK signaling pathway in both Drosophila and mammalian cells. Furthermore, GSK3ß was involved in neural specification downstream of WNK. These results suggest that GSK3ß/Sgg functions as a positive effector in the WNK signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2794127835,"Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of death in the western world, and its incidence increases with patient age. It is also known that with age there occur changes in the levels of certain hormones, including an increase in the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins (PtGs) as a result of the loss of gonadal hormone feedback. We recently reported that functional PtG receptors are expressed in human lung cancer cells, rhabdomyosarcoma cells, and malignant hematopoietic stem cells. Findings Here we report for the first time that the receptors for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are expressed in primary tumor samples isolated from CRC patients as well as in the established human CRC cell lines HTC116 and HTB37. Moreover, we also report that PtGs stimulate chemotaxis, adhesion, and proliferation of these cell lines. Conclusions Our results suggest that PtGs play an important and underappreciated role in CRC pathogenesis, and we call for further studies to better define their role in gastrointestinal malignancies and their direct effect on putative CRC cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2789868772,"Taxol is a widely used chemotherapy drug used clinically for ovarian cancer, although the response to Taxol among individuals varies due to the heterogeneity among ovarian cancer patients. In this work, we analyzed differences in the prognostic effect of gene expression and Taxol usage in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and identified specific genes associated with the Taxol effect. Using the Cox regression model, a risk model (Taxol score) was developed to assess the outcome of ovarian cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy with Taxol. According to the results, survival was significantly associated with the Taxol score. Moreover, the patients in the high and low Taxol score group had different responses to Taxol. This result was further validated in another two independent datasets. The correlation between clinicopathological indicators was also analyzed, and we determined that the Taxol score is not associated with age, pathological stage, or Taxol treatment, while there was significant correlation with tumor size and grade. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that various signaling pathways including ECM receptor, drug metabolism and ascorbate metabolism pathways were significantly enriched in the high Taxol score group. Collectively, these results indicate that the model is robust for predicting the effectiveness of Taxol by reflecting the various cell statuses of serous ovarian carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2793440490,"The transcription factor, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), influences the expression of heat shock proteins as well as other activities like the induction of tumor suppressor genes, signal transduction pathway, and glucose metabolism. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HSF1 gene might affect its expression or function which might have an influence on the development of breast cancer. The study group included 242 individuals (146 breast cancer patients and 96 healthy controls). From the cancer patients, genomic DNA was extracted from 96 blood samples and 50 Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissues, while from the controls DNA were extracted from blood only. Genotype was carried out for four SNPs in the HSF1 gene (rs78202224, rs35253356, rs4977219 and rs34404564) using Taqman genotyping assay method. The HSF1 expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry on FFPE tissues (cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue). The SNP rs78202224 (G>T) was significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer. The combined TT + GT genotype (OR: 6.91; p: 0.035) and the T allele showed high risk (OR: 5.81; p:0.0085) for breast cancer development. The SNP rs34404564 (A>G) had a protective effect against the development of breast cancer. The genotype AG (OR: 0.41; p = 0.0059) and GG+AG (OR: 0.52; p: 0.026) occurred at a significantly lower frequency in the breast cancer patients compared to the frequency in healthy controls. No significant relationship was identified between either rs35253356 (A>G) or rs4977219 (A>C) and breast cancer in Saudi. The HSF1 protein expression was higher in all invasive and in situ breast carcinoma compared to the normal tissue. A stronger positive staining for HSF1 was found in the nucleus compared to the cytoplasm. Our results show that HSF1 gene expression is elevated in breast cancer tissue and two of the studied SNPs correlate significantly with cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2791088286,"Cognitive impairment is a dysfunction observed as a sequel of various neurodegenerative diseases, as well as a concomitant element in the elderly stages of life. In clinical settings, this malfunction is identified as mild cognitive impairment. Previous studies have suggested that cognitive impairment could be the result of a reduction in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and/or immune dysfunction. Copolymer-1 (Cop-1) is an FDA-approved synthetic peptide capable of inducing the activation of Th2/3 cells, which are able to release BDNF, as well as to migrate and accumulate in the brain. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Cop-1 immunization on improvement of cognition in adult rats. For this purpose, we performed four experiments. We evaluated the effect of Cop-1 immunization on learning/memory using the Morris water maze for spatial memory and autoshaping for associative memory in 3- or 6-month-old rats. BDNF concentrations at the hippocampus were determined by ELISA. Cop-1 immunization induced a significant improvement of spatial memory and associative memory in 6-month-old rats. Likewise, Cop-1 improved spatial memory and associative memory when animals were immunized at 3 months and evaluated at 6 months old. Additionally, Cop-1 induced a significant increase in BDNF levels at the hippocampus. To our knowledge, the present investigation reports the first instance of Cop-1 treatment enhancing cognitive function in normal young adult rats, suggesting that Cop-1 may be a practical therapeutic strategy potentially useful for age- or disease-related cognitive impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2794020827,"The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an important and widely used vertebrate model organism for the study of human diseases which include disorders caused by dysfunctional mitochondria. Mitochondria play an essential role in both energy metabolism and apoptosis, which are mediated through a mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL). In order to examine the cardiolipin profile in the zebrafish model, we developed a CL analysis platform by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Meanwhile, we tested whether chlorella diet would alter the CL profile in the larval fish, and in various organs of the adult fish. The results showed that chlorella diet increased the chain length of CL in larval fish. In the adult zebrafish, the distribution patterns of CL species were similar between the adult brain and eye tissues, and between the heart and muscles. Interestingly, monolyso-cardiolipin (MLCL) was not detected in brain and eyes but found in other examined tissues, indicating a different remodeling mechanism to maintain the CL integrity. While the adult zebrafish were fed with chlorella for four weeks, the CL distribution showed an increase of the species of saturated acyl chains in the brain and eyes, but a decrease in the other organs. Moreover, chlorella diet led to a decrease of MLCL percentage in organs except the non-MLCL-containing brain and eyes. The CL analysis in the zebrafish provides an important tool for studying the mechanism of mitochondria diseases, and may also be useful for testing medical regimens targeting against the Barth Syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2786064707,"Parent-offspring communication remains an unresolved challenge for biologist. The difficulty of the challenge comes from the fact that it is a multifaceted problem with connections to life-history evolution, parent-offspring conflict, kin selection and signalling. Previous efforts mainly focused on modelling resource allocation at the expense of the dynamic interaction during a reproductive season. Here we present a two-stage model of begging where the first stage models the interaction between nestlings and parents within a nest and the second stage models the life-history trade-offs. We show in an asexual population that honest begging results in decreased variance of collected food between siblings, which leads to mean number of surviving offspring. Thus, honest begging can be seen as a special bet-hedging against informational uncertainty, which not just decreases the variance of fitness but also increases the arithmetic mean."
https://openalex.org/W2962731553,"We show that genetic recombination can be a powerful mechanism for escaping suboptimal peaks. Recent studies of empirical fitness landscapes reveal complex gene interactions and multiple peaks. However, classical work on recombination largely ignores the effect of complex gene interactions. Briefly, we restrict to fitness landscapes where the global peak is difficult to access. If the optimal genotype can be generated by shuffling genes present in the population, then recombination will produce the genotype. If, in addition, recombination is sufficiently rare, then the proportion of the genotype is expected to increase. Specifically, we consider landscapes where shuffling of suboptimal peak genotypes can produce the global peak genotype. The advantage of recombination we identify has no correspondence for 2-locus systems or for smooth landscapes. The effect of recombination indicated is sometimes extreme, also for rare recombination, in the sense that shutting off recombination could result in the organism failing to adapt. A standard question about recombination is whether the mechanism tends to accelerate or decelerate adaptation. However, we argue that extreme effects may be more important than how the majority falls. In a limited sense, our result can be considered a support for Sewall Wright’s view that adaptation sometimes works better in subdivided populations."
https://openalex.org/W2790455995,"Cleistogamy refers to a type of sexual breeding system with closed flowers. Cleistogamous flowers shed their pollen before flower opening, which leads to autogamy. Two SNPs in the open reading frame region of the Cly1 gene are associated with floral type. In the present study, we investigated the floral type of 436 barley accessions. Molecular markers were developed to genotype these barley accessions based on the two SNPs in the Cly1 gene region. The molecular markers explained floral type in 90% of the accessions. The Cly1 gene was sequenced in accessions with inconsistent genotype and phenotype. Thirteen SNPs were detected with ten new SNPs in the gene region. We further investigated whether floral type was associated with temperature stress tolerance in four field trials. One site experienced frost stress with a minimum temperature of -3.4°C during flowering. Grain fertility rates as low as 85% were observed at this site but ranged from 92–96% at the other three sites. The relationship between grain fertility rate and floral type under temperature stress was inconclusive. Some lines with higher grain fertility rates were identified under frost stress, and would be useful for frost stress studies in barley."
https://openalex.org/W2792311112,"CK2 is a pleiotropic S/T protein kinase (formerly known as casein kinase 2) which is attracting increasing interest as therapeutic target, and the identification of its substrates is a crucial step in determining its involvement in different pathological conditions. We recently found that S131 of Akt2 (homologous to the well established CK2 target S129 of Akt1) is not phosphorylated by CK2 either in vitro or in vivo, although the consensus sequence recognized by CK2 (S/T-x-x-E/D/pS/pT) is conserved in it. Here, by exploiting synthetic peptides, in cell transfection experiments, and computational analysis, we show that a single sequence element, a T at position n+1, hampers phosphorylation, causing an α-helix structure organization which prevents the recognition of its own consensus by CK2. Our results highlight the role of negative determinants as crucial modulators of CK2 targeting and corroborate the concept that Akt1 and Akt2 display isoform specific features. Experiments with synthetic peptides suggest that Akt2 S131 could be phosphorylated by kinases of the Plk (Polo-like kinase) family, which are insensitive to the presence of the n+1 T. The low phylogenetic conservation of the Akt2 sequence around S131, as opposed to the extremely well-conserved Akt1 homologous sequence, would indicate a dominant positive role in the selective pressure only for the Akt1 phosphoacceptor site committed to undergo phosphorylation by CK2. By contrast, Akt2 S131 may mediate the response to specific physio/pathological conditions, being consequently shielded against basal CK2 targeting."
