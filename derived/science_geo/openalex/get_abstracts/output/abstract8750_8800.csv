https://openalex.org/W2019605110,"The formation, stereostructure, and cellular reactions of the 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide metabolites of the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene have been examined after topical application of benzo[a]pyrene to the skin of mice. In this known target tissue, polymer adducts from diastereomeric diol epoxides, (+)-(7S, 8R, 9R, 10R) and (+)-(7R, 8S, 9R, 10R), were formed stereospecifically from their corresponding 7,8-dihydrodiols. Both diol epoxides bind with proteins, RNA, and DNA in vivo. For the nucleic acids, binding occurs preferentially at the 2-amino group of guanine in cellular RNA and DNA in vivo. Methods for establishing the structure of the cellular adducts as well as the possible biological implications of their formation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1996297374,"The protease inhibitor leupeptin decreases protein degradation in rat skeletal and cardiac muscle incubated in vitro, while protein synthesis remains unaltered. Leupeptin also lowers protein breakdown in denervated rat muscles and affected muscles from mice with hereditary muscular dystrophy. Leupeptin may thus be useful in retarding tissue atrophy. Since homogenates of leupeptin-treated muscles had decreased cathepsin B activity, this lysosomal protease may play a role in protein turnover in normal and diseased muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1997430975,Human circulating monocytes in tissue culture are capable of resorbing devitalized adult and fetal bone. An important component of this process is the adhesion of the cells to the mineralized substrate and the localized removal of matrix from beneath the attached cells. The process appears to involve both release of lysosomal enzymes onto the substrate and intracellular accumulation (transport) of resorbed matrix.
https://openalex.org/W119353100,"Calculation of rates of protein synthesis, based upon incorporation of [14C]phenylalanine into protein, depended upon use of the specific activity of phenylalanyl-tRNA. At a perfusate phenylalanine concentration of 0.01 mM, the specific activity of phenylalanyl-tRNA was 65 and 155% of extracellular and intracellular specific activities, respectively. At this concentration, the rate of protein synthesis was overestimated if calculated using the intracellular specific activity, but underestimated if the extracellular specific activity was employed. Thus, neither the extracellular nor total intracellular pool of phenylalanine served as the sole precursor for protein synthesis. When the concentration of perfusate phenylalanine was increased from 0.01 to 3.6 mM, the concentration of intracellular phenylalanine increased linearly. At a perfusate phenylalanine concentration of 0.4 mM, specific activities of extracellular, intracellular, and tRNA-bound phenylalanine were the same, and the calculated rate of protein synthesis was 106 nmol of phenylalanine incorporated/g of heart/h. The same rate was obtained using the specific activity of V2lphenylalanyLtRNA, when perfusate phenylalanine was 0.01 mM. Thus, protein synthesis did not depend on extracellular phenylalanine concentration over this range. Similarly, raising perfusate phenylalanine from 0.01 to 3.6 mM had no effect on the incorporation of [14Clhistidine. Addition of insulin to the perfusate did not modify the relationship between the specific activities of extracellular, intracellular, and tRNA-bound phenylalanine at perfusate phenylalanine levels of either 0.01 or 0.4 mM, but increased the rate of protein synthesis approximately 100%. Specific activities of heart phenylalanine and phenylalanyl-tRNA equilibrated with perfusate phenylalanine (0.01 mM) within 3 to 5 min. Addition of insulin resulted in even faster equilibration. Two models of amino acid compartmentation involving (a) aminoacylation of tRNA from both the extracellular and intracellular compartments or (b) aminoacylation of tRNA from a compartmented intracellular pool were consistent with the steady state and transient data. Inclusion of an intracellular pool of nonradioactive phenylalanine was not required to fit the data. Preferential aminoacyla-"

https://openalex.org/W1990063230,Cultured skin fibroblasts from subjects with clinically apparent diabetes mellitus and from subjects genetically predisposed to diabetes have a replicative lifespan that is inversely related to donor age. Fibroblasts from carefully defined normal subjects not predisposed to diabetes fail to show this correlation. The data support the idea that physiologic status of the tissue donor is a more precise determinant of fibroblast replicative lifespan than chronologic age.
https://openalex.org/W2074678203,"Command neurons that cause rhythmic feeding behavior in the marine mollusc Pleurobranchaea californica have been identified in the cerebropleural ganglion (brain). Intracellular stimulation of single command neurons in isolated nervous systems, semi-intact prepartions, and restrained whole animals causes the same rhythmic motor output pattern as occurs during feeding. During this motor output pattern, action potentials recorded intracellularly from the command neurons occur in cyclic bursts that are phase-locked with the feeding rhythm. This modulation results from repetitive, alternating bursts of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, which are caused at least in part by synaptic feedback to the command neurons from identified classes of neurons in the feeding network. Central feedback to command neurons from the motor network they excite provides a possible general physiological mechanism for the sustained oscillation of neural networks controlling cyclic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2011458141,Sixteen hours of light daily (114 to 207 lux) increased weight gains and milk yield 10 to 15% in Holstein cattle in comparison with cattle exposed to natural-length photoperiods (39 to 93 lux) of 9 to 12 hours. The weight gain was accomplished without increased consumption of feed. Manipulation of supplemental light may thus cause dramatic increases in food supplies from animals.
https://openalex.org/W2010651813,"Serum from patients with lichen myxedematosus, when added to exponentially growing normal human skin fibroblasts, stimulates DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. The degree of response in vitro is correlated with the extent of the disease in vivo and is specific for fibroblasts. The results suggest that there is a systemic factor (or factors) which may play a role in the etiology of diseases affecting the connective tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1974291652,"Food stimuli normally excite the command neurons of Pleurobranchaea that cause feeding. In contrast, the same food stimuli selectively inhibit these neurons in specimens that have been trained to suppress feeding and withdraw from food by means of an avoidance conditioning paradigm consisting of paired food and conditional shock. Food stimuli excite the feeding command neurons of yoked control specimens exposed to unpaired food and shock, but inhibit the feeding command neurons of untrained specimens that have been satiated with food. These results suggest that the command neurons serve as a neural locus at which an animal's behavior is modulated by past experiences. These results also establish a neural correlate of behavioral plasticity, in the form of synaptic inhibition of the command neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1987873049,Sulfhydryl reagents exert a profound influence on the monodeiodination of thyroxine to triiodothyronine by rat and sheep tissues in vitro. A marked dithiothreitol-induced increase in the monodeiodination by fetal sheep liver homogenates suggests that the characteristically low conversion in fetal tissues is related more to the status of sulfhydryl groups than to a deficiency of the monodeiodinating enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2075739846,"Growth of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 is enhanced by androgens, but only at pharmacological concentrations. Although physiological concentrations of androgens translocate the androgen receptor into the nucleus, no mitogenic effects are observed. By contrast, pharmacological androgens translocate not only the androgen receptor but also the estrogen receptor, and at these high doses significantly increase both DNA and estrogen-dependent protein synthesis. We therefore propose that androgens stimulate MCF-7 cell growth not through the androgen receptor but rather through the estrogen receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1572649633,"An in vitro study of bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase activity of rat liver was undertaken in order to determine whether separate amino acid-specific enzymes catalyzed the formation of glycine and taurine conjugates of bile acids as postulated by others. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 200-fold purified enzyme localized the glycine- and taurine-dependent activities to a single band. Both activities were optimal at pH 7.8 and showed similar loss of activity at pH 6.0, pH 9.0, in the presence of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and at temperatures exceeding 50 degrees. With the purified fraction, Km for glycine was 31 mM and Km for taurine was 0.8 mM. Km for several bile acid-CoA substrates was approximately 20 micron and independent of the amino acid acceptor. Only amino acids with terminal alpha- or beta-amino groups were active as acyl acceptors. Acyl donors were limited to bile acid-CoA derivatives. The data support the conclusion that the rat has a single bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase. The substrate kinetics are consistent with previous observations that taurine conjugates predominate in rat bile at normal hepatocellular concentrations of glycine and taurine."

Identification was based on correspondence with synthetic bityrosine with respect to chromatography, fluorescence, and ultraviolet and mass spectra. It is suggested that the compound may form cross-links with polypeptide chains in old and cataractous lenses, causing significant alteration in native protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W2083228949,Amantadine hydrochloride decreases the sensitivity of denervated mammalian muscle to iontophoretically applied acetylcholine. The drug depresses the amplitude of the end-plate current and reverses the slope of the relation between half-decay time and membrane potential suggesting that it alters the ionic conductance that is mediated by the acetylcholine receptor. Binding studies confirm that amantadine acts on the ion conductance modulator rather than the acetylcholine receptor.

https://openalex.org/W1967429302,"The gymnotoid electric fish Hypopomus artedi discriminates between electric stimulus pulses with identical spectral amplitudes but different spectral phase functions. Behavioral results can be explained on the assumption that electroreception is based on a linear filter, approximately matched to the species' electric organ discharge. The impulse response of the appropriate matched filter, in fact, resembles the known impulse response of the electroreceptors involved."
https://openalex.org/W1985308807,"The cyclic polyether, 18-crown-6, reacts with protonated amines in methanol to form complexes whose formation constants (log K) decrease in the order NH4+, RNH3+ greater than R2NH2+ greater than R3NH+. In the case of the organic amines, this stability order is identical to the earlier observed permeability sequence for protonated organic amines in glyceryl dioleate bilayers treated with valinomycin, nonactin, or gramicidin, and in bullfrog and rabbit gallbladder membranes. The decrease in log K values in the above series is primarily a result of decreased enthalpy change (deltaH) values, the entropy change (TdeltaS) term being essentially constant for the systems studied."
https://openalex.org/W2034117743,"The critical period for modifying the preferred direction in cat cortical units occurs earlier than that for monocular deprivation. The independence of the effects of these two types of deprivation from each other was tested by rearing six kittens with both reverse suture and reversed directional deprivation. The kittens were placed in a drum rotating in one direction with one eye open at ages 2 1/2 to 5 weeks; the drum rotation was reversed and the other eye opened when they were 5 to 12 weeks old. Recordings were then made in the visual cortex. The results were the sum of the effects of reverse suture and reversal of directional deprivation: most cells were driven by the eye that was open second, and most unidirectional cells preferred the direction to which the animals were exposed first. Consequently, many unidirectional cells preferred the first direction but were driven by the eye open second--a combination that the animal never saw during rearing. There was also an effect of ocular deprivation on directional properties and vice versa: reverse suture reduced the overall percentage of unidirectional cells, just as directional deprivation has been shown to affect the ocular dominance histogram. This result suggests that the same cells may be affected by both forms of deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W1971469617,"In an auditory or musical memory task, subjects made pitch recognition judgments when the tones to be compared were separated by a sequence of interpolated tones. The left-handed subjects performed significantly better than the right-handed and also had a significantly higher variance. Further analysis showed that the superior performance was attributable largely to the left-handed subjects with mixed hand preference."

https://openalex.org/W2024216839,"L-Dopa has been shown to demonstrate enhanced toxicity toward melanoma cells in vitro. Since melanocytes arise from the neural crest embryologically, the effect of L-dopa methyl ester, a soluble analog, on the murine C1300 neuroblastoma was studied. There was significant antitumor activity against the neuroblastoma, which was enhanced by combination with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, Ro4-4602. In vitro studies suggested inhibition of DNA synthesis as the principal site of action. A mechanism involving sulfhydryl compound scavenging is postulated."

https://openalex.org/W1976109604,"Intravenous injection of a sublethal dose of lead acetate into a domestic pig resulted in a 4.5-fold increase of guanine in the urine, indicating an impairment in the conversion of guanine to xanthine. This impairment is probably due to the inhibition of guanine aminohydrolase (guanase), since the activity of this enzyme is inhibited by Pb2+ (the inhibition constant being 3.0 X 10(-6)M). Postmortem histological examination revealed concretions of crystalline material in the epiphyseal plate of the femoral head. Extraction of the section containing the concretions showed that they were guanine. The relation of these findings to saturnine gout is discussed."

Directional selectivity was markedly reduced only in the strobe-reared animals, thus demonstrating visual plasticity in a system that develops apparently normally without visual experience."

Assays were made immediately after extraction, without purification, concentration, or treatment with phenol or detergent. This indicates that the double-stranded RNA is native and is not an artifact induced by purification methods."
https://openalex.org/W1993093566,"The Legionnaires' disease organism was isolated from lung tissue taken from two fatalities of the Legionnaires' disease epidemic that occurred in Philadelphia during 1976. In yolk sac tissue the agent grew as a small coccobacillary microorgansim, which was Gram variable and Gimenez positive. Intracellular coccoid and bacillary forms, detected by electron microscopy, within and without vacuoles, underwent multiplication by septate binary fission. Some of the intracellular forms resembled obligate intracellular pathogens. On defined bacteriologic media, the organisms were predominantly bacillary. The organism conforms to the morphologic criteria of a prokaryocyte."

https://openalex.org/W1606391120,"Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.7) catalyzes the adenosylcobalamin-dependent deamination of ethanolamine and 2-aminopropanol. Incubation of the enzyme.cofactor complex with 2-aminoacetaldehyde leads to rapid cleavage of the carbon--cobalt bond accompanied by the destruction of the corrinoid portion of the cofactor. During this reaction the adenosyl portion of the cofactor is oxidized to 4',5'-anhydroadenosine, and the aminoacetaldehyde is converted to acetic acid, which remains associated with the enzyme as a noncovalent complex which survives gel filtration. There is no evidence for the alkylation of the corrin metal by the substrate analog. The enzyme.AdoCbl complex is thus able to eliminate an amino group from a substrate analog without the formation of a new alkyl cobalamin in which the analog is a ligand. These observations do not support the participation of what might be termed substratylcobalamin as an intermediate in the ammonia migration occurring in reactions catalyzed by ethanolamine ammonia-lyase."

Those of long duration are recorded in five classes of cells in the flexion circuit, while those of short duration are recorded in three classes of cells in the extension circuit. The durations of the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are matched to the durations of inhibition required by the different phases of the behavior."
