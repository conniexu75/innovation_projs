https://openalex.org/W1603411458,"Extreme codon bias is seen for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes for the fermentative alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme I (ADH-I) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Over 98% of the 1004 amino acid residues analyzed by DNA sequencing are coded for by a select 25 of the 61 possible coding triplets. These preferred codons tend to be highly homologous to the anticodons of the major yeast isoacceptor tRNA species. Codons which necessitate site by side GC base pairs between the codons and the tRNA anticodons are always avoided whenever possible. Codons containing 100% G, C, A, U, GC, or AU are also avoided. This provides for approximately equivalent codon-anticodon binding energies for all preferred triplets. All sequenced yeast genes show a distinct preference for these same 25 codons. The degree of preference varies from greater than 90% for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ADH-I to less than 20% for iso-2 cytochrome c. The degree of bias for these 25 preferred triplets in each gene is correlated with the level of its mRNA in the cytoplasm. Genes which are strongly expressed are more biased than genes with a lower level of expression. A similar phenomenon is observed in the codon preferences of highly expressed genes in Escherichia coli. High levels of gene expression are well correlated with high levels of codon bias toward 22 of the 61 coding triplets. As in yeast, these preferred codons are highly complementary to the major cellular isoacceptor tRNA species. In at least four cases (Ala, Arg, Leu, and Val), these preferred E. coli codons are incompatible with the preferred yeast codons."
https://openalex.org/W2171885622,"The SUC2 gene of yeast (Saccharomyces) encodes two forms of invertase: a secreted, glycosylated form, the synthesis of which is regulated by glucose repression, and an intracellular, nonglycosylated enzyme that is produced constitutively. The SUC2 gene has been cloned and shown to encode two RNAs (1.8 and 1.9 kb) that differ at their 5′ ends. The stable level of the larger RNA is regulated by glucose; the level of the smaller RNA is not. A correspondence between the presence of the 1.9 kb RNA and the secreted invertase, and between the 1.8 kb RNA and the intracellular invertase, was observed in glucose-repressed and -derepressed wild-type cells. In addition, cells carrying a mutation at the SNF1 locus fail to derepress synthesis of the secreted invertase and also fail to produce stable 1.9 kb RNA during growth in low glucose. Glucose regulation of invertase synthesis thus is exerted, at least in part, at the RNA level. A naturally silent allele (suc2°) of the SUC2 locus that does not direct the synthesis of active invertase was found to produce both the 1.8 and 1.9 kb RNAs under normal regulation by glucose. A model is proposed to account for the synthesis and regulation of the two forms of invertase: the larger, regulated mRNA contains the initiation codon for the signal sequence required for synthesis of the secreted, glycosylated form of invertase; the smaller, constitutively transcribed mRNA begins within the coding region of the signal sequence, resulting in synthesis of the intracellular enzyme."

The amount of inclusion product within the cells corresponds to the quantity of chimeric protein formed by the bacteria. At peak production, the inclusion bodies may occupy as much as 20 percent of the Escherichia coli cellular volume."
https://openalex.org/W1964260180,"The combination of bacteria and blood in a wound can have lethal consequences, probably because hemoglobin iron supports prolific bacterial growth. Rats inoculated intraperitoneally with pathogenic Escherichia coli and small amounts of hemoglobin die. Simultaneous administration of haptoglobin, a naturally occurring hemoglobin-binding protein, fully protects against lethality. Therefore, haptoglobin may not only accelerate the clearance of free hemoglobin, but also limit its utilization by adventitious bacteria. Haptoglobin may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of life-threatening, hemoglobin-driven bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W1557927258,"The presence of activators of the fibrinolytic system in blood plasma has been assumed for a long time but never convincingly documented by the isolation of characterized and physiologically plausible enzymes. The low catalytic efficiency of previously identified plasma plasminogen activators, which has made their physiological significance uncertain, prompted us to search for other plasma enzymes, resembling especially the potent urinary activator, urokinase. We report here the detection of a urokinase-like activity in human plasma, and the isolation of the enzyme from whole plasma protein fractions. The purified enzyme is indistinguishable from the 53,000-dalton components of human urinary urokinase in the following respects: apparent Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, double immunodiffusion, amino acid analysis, two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps, catalytic efficiency with synthetic peptide substrates, and inhibitor spectrum. The results suggest (a) that the enzyme is present in plasma in a latent form whose nature remains to be defined, and (b) that the circulating concentration is at least 5 to 10 microgram/liter, and sufficient to generate substantial levels of plasmin, particularly if activation were somehow confined by localization at specific sites."
https://openalex.org/W1484791891,"DNA polymerase III', a new form of DNA polymerase III, has been purified 15,000-fold to 90% homogeneity from an Escherichia coli K12 strain. DNA polymerase III's is a subassembly of four subunits of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme; it has functional and physical properties intermediate between the core DNA polymerase III and holoenzyme. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed under denaturing conditions indicates DNA polymerase III' to be a complex of the alpha, epsilon, and theta subunits of DNA polymerase III and a newly assigned subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, tau (Mr = 83,000). Both gel filtration and phosphocellulose chromatography separate DNA polymerase III from DNA polymerase III'. All enzyme forms can utilize a duplex template containing short gaps. DNA polymerase III', like the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, can synthesize DNA on a long single-stranded template in the presence of 5 mM spermidine; DNA polymerase III cannot. Alone, DNA polymerase III' is inert in the G4 natural replicative system in which the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is active. Molecular weight and subunit stoichiometry determinations suggest that DNA polymerase III' contains two units of core DNA polymerase III and two tau subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1484322889,"A [3H]mannose suicide selection has been used to isolate mutants in yeast which contain temperature-sensitive defects in asparagine-linked glycosylation. The surviving cells were screened at the nonpermissive temperature for a decreased ability to incorporate [3H]mannose and for defects in glycosylation of the secreted protein invertase. One of these mutants (alg1-1) has been characterized and found to be blocked in the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. The alg1-1 cells synthesize mannosyl compounds at 60% of the wild type level at the nonpermissive temperature and 105% of the wild type level at the permissive temperature. In vivo labeling experiments have demonstrated that alg1-1 cells are able to synthesize GlcNAc2-lipid but are unable to synthesize any mannose-containing oligosaccharide-lipids. This result was confirmed by in vitro labeling of yeast membranes. When incubated with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, alg1-1 membranes synthesized GlcNAc2-lipid but failed to elongate it when GDP-Man was added. The alg1-1 membranes also failed to elongate exogenous GlcNAc2-lipid but were able to convert Man1GlcNAc2-lipid to Man5-Glc-NAc2-lipid in the presence of GDP-Man. These results indicate that the alg1-1 mutant is blocked specifically in the addition of the first mannose residue to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1486598550,"The active transport of maltose in Escherichia coli requires the products of five genes. These include a water-soluble periplasmic maltose-binding protein, three cytoplasmic membrane proteins, and an outer membrane protein. In order to evaluate the role of the maltose-binding protein in active transport, a nonpolar internal deletion of the structural gene for the maltose-binding protein was constructed. A strain which contains this deletion is unable to grow on maltose at an external concentration of 25 mM, even when the remaining components of the transport system are synthesized constitutively. This demonstrates that the periplasmic maltose-binding protein is essential for detectable translocation of maltose across the cytoplasmic membrane. Mal+ revertants of the deletion strain were obtained. In one of these strains, the remaining components of the maltose transport system gained the ability to translocate maltose across the membrane independently of the periplasmic binding protein. Maltose transport in this revertant strain is specific for maltose; it is not inhibited by other alpha and beta glucosides and galactosides. In contrast to the wild type, transport activity in the Mal+ revertant strain is retained by spheroplasts. The cytoplasmic membrane components of the maltose transport system in the revertant appear to form a substrate recognition site. It is likely that this site exists in wild type cells but is available only to substrate molecules that are bound to the maltose-binding protein. A model for the operation of the transport system is presented. In this model, the substrate recognition site in the cytoplasmic membrane is exposed to alternate sides of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1540408159,"A calcium (Ca2+)-activated, neutral proteinase has been purified from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The protocol used has resulted in a 3,600-fold purification of the enzyme in a yield of 21% from the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell postnuclear supernatant. The purified proteinase has a high substrate specificity for the intermediate filament subunit proteins, vimentin and desmin, and showed no activity towards other intermediate filament proteins except a 60,000-dalton protein of the cytokeratins. Also, there was no degradation of actin, tubulin, the major constituent proteins of myofibrils and several standard proteins. Characterization of the purified proteinase has shown that it is activated by Ca2+ (10 to 100 microM), is probably calmodulin-independent and irreversibly loses activity when incubated in the presence of Ca2+ without substrate. The enzyme has a Km of 1.7 x 10(-8) M for vimentin and 5.2 x 10(-7) M for desmin. The proteinase has a major subunit of 72,000 daltons which has the catalytic center and a minor component of 29,000 daltons; by gel permeation chromatography it has an apparent molecular weight of 100,000. It requires a reduced sulfhydryl group for activity and can be inhibited by sulfhydryl-blocking reagents. The high substrate specificity of the proteinase indicates that it is involved in the regulation of the distribution and turnover of vimentin- and desmin-containing intermediate filaments."

https://openalex.org/W1993089613,"An obesity syndrome was found in a number of mice infected as young adults with canine distemper virus, a morbillivirus antigenically related to measles. Body weights of obese animals 16 to 20 weeks after infection were comparable to those reported for genetically obese mice and for mice rendered obese by hypothalamic lesions. The total number of adipocytes in specific fat deposits was greater in obese animals than in their lean littermates. This hyperplasia was accompanied by moderate cell enlargement. Pancreatic islet tissue was also hypercellular in the obese mice. Brain tissue from the obese mice showed no overt pathology, and immunofluorescence staining for viral antigens was negative. There may be a selective, virus-induced disruption of critical brain catecholamine pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1546095252,"Mutations at three genetic loci (termed prlA,B,C) were previously shown to specifically suppress signal sequence mutations in the lamB gene encoding the outer membrane phage lambda receptor protein of Escherichia coli (Emr, S. D., Hanley-Way, S., and Silhavy, T. J. (1981) Cell 23, 79-88). The majority of these suppressor mutations map at the prlA locus and are thought to result in an altered ribosomal protein. In this study, we demonstrate that prlA mutations also phenotypically suppress signal sequence mutations in the malE gene encoding the periplasmic maltose-binding protein. For both lamB and malE mutations, suppression is achieved by transporting the export-defective protein to its correct extracytoplasmic location, in some instances with near 100% efficiency. With a single exception, the mutant-exported protein is apparently processed to its normal mature form. These results indicate that prlA-mediated protein export occurs via the usual route, and additional data suggest that the prlA product directly interacts with the mutant signal sequence to restore export. The single prlC allele also suppresses malE signal sequence mutations, whereas the single prlB allele only phenotypically suppresses lamB signal sequence mutations. However, with these latter two suppressors, there is some indication that export of the phage lambda receptor to the outer membrane is not accomplished by the usual route."
https://openalex.org/W1541768292,"The role of perfusate amino acid concentrations in regulating rates of protein synthesis was investigated using the perfused rat liver. Livers from fed rats were perfused with a nonrecirculating medium and the incorporation of [3H]leucine into albumin and total protein was determined under conditions where the leucyl-tRNALeu and perfusate leucine specific activities were equal and constant. During perfusions of less than 1 h, rates of total protein synthesis were sensitive to the concentrations of amino acids in the perfusate. When no exogenous amino acids were provided, rates of synthesis of albumin and total protein were 40% of the maximal rates which were achieved when the medium was supplemented with 5 times the normal plasma concentrations of amino acids. However, rates of synthesis in livers perfused with amino acid-deficient medium rose with extension of the duration of perfusion to 95 min. The defect induced by amino acid deficiency did not appear to result from reductions in the charging of tRNA since no change in the quantities of amino acids bound to tRNA occurred in the amino acid-deficient perfusion. The recovery of protein synthesis with time was prevented by inhibitors of proteolysis suggesting a role for protein degradation in this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2083586816,"The rate of protein degradation in rabbit erythrocytes in normally very low. However, when cells were exposed to agents that oxidize cell proteins (nitrite or phenylhydrazine), the degradation of erythrocyte proteins to amino acids increased 7- to 33-fold. This effect was inhibited by the reducing agent methylene blue. Stimulation of proteolysis also occurred in cell extracts and resulted from the production of substrates (damaged proteins) rather than from activation of proteases. Inhibitors of glycolysis and of the soluble adenosine triphosphate-dependent proteolytic pathway decreased the protein degradation induced by nitrite, whereas inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis had no effect. Thus, the adenosine triphosphate-dependent proteolytic system is present in mature red cells where it may help protect against the accumulation of proteins damaged by oxidation or other means."
https://openalex.org/W1598614202,"p-Aminobenzamidine is weakly fluorescent in neutral aqueous buffer, with excitation and emission maxima at 293 and 376 nm, respectively. Binding to trypsin results in a blue shift of the emission peak to 362 nm, and 50-fold fluorescence enhancement, while binding to thrombin causes a shift to 368 nm and a 230-fold fluorescence enhancement. This phenomenon is due to hydrophobic interactions, as evidenced by the similar properties observed when p-aminobenzamidine is dissolved in solvents of decreasing polarity. The absorbance spectrum of p-aminobenzamidine is red-shifted by formation of a complex with proteases, with the major difference peak appearing at 317 nm and 323 nm for trypsin and thrombin, respectively. The difference extinction coefficients were 6000 M-1 cm-1 for trypsin complex and 13,300 M-1 cm-1 for thrombin complex at the peak wavelengths. Titration of trypsin and thrombin with the probe indicated one binding site per molecule, with dissociation constants equal to the kinetically determined inhibition constants. The KD values for trypsin and thrombin were 6.1 and 65 microM, respectively. An important potential use of this probe is in studies of inhibitor and substrate binding by rapid reaction kinetic techniques. Using this probe to study the interaction of thrombin with antithrombin III yielded a bimolecular rate constant of 8.0 x 10(3) M-1 s-1, which compares favorably with the value of 8.7 x 10(3) M-1 s-1 obtained from discontinuous assays of the rate of thrombin neutralization."

https://openalex.org/W1509588036,"A prolonged digestion of colicin E1 with dilute trypsin results in the generation of a trypsin-resistant peptide fragment of the colicin which is approximately one-third of the molecule. The amino acid composition of the fragment, Mr = 20,000, is more nonpolar in nature than the colicin, with the major change in composition being the reduction of the arginine content from 25 residues in the Mr = 56,000 colicin molecule to approximately 1 residue in the fragment. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the tryptic fragment shows no similarity to that of colicin E1. Alignment of this sequence with the complete amino acid sequence of the colicin E1 molecule obtained by others, shows that the fragment occupies all, or almost all, of the COOH-terminal section of the molecule. The fragment behaved similarly to colicin E1, in being able to dissipate a potassium diffusion potential in unilamellar membrane vesicles made of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. The fragment was able to dissipate the diffusion potential above and below the temperature region (Tm = 23.5-24 degrees C) of the lipid phase transition in these vesicles, consistent with a channel-like function. The fragment did not show measurable binding to colicin receptor sites on the cell surface, but was much more efficient than colicin E1 in its ability to inhibit proline transport by inner membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli. These data imply that a membrane channel-forming function of the molecule is located in this 20,000 molecular weight region at the COOH-terminal end of the colicin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1662236624,"Measurements of the natural abundance of 13C at C-1, C-9, and C-10 in fatty acids synthesized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown aerobically at 30 degrees C show that alkyl chain positions derived from the carboxyl group of the acetate precursor must be enriched in 13C by 2.5 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand while those derived from the methyl group in acetate must be depleted in 13C by an equal amount. Selective depletions of 13C observed at the C-9 and C-10 positions of palmitoleate and oleate require that (i) the carbon kinetic isotope effect associated with the action of desaturase at C-9 must be between 1.2 and 1.6% in vivo, (ii) at C-10 the effect must be between 0.9 and 1.3%, and (iii) less than 20% of the C18 carbon skeletons synthesized are preserved within the cell, the remainder apparently being degraded. It is shown that the novo synthesis (i.e. by fatty acid synthetase) is responsible for the production of more than 95% of the supply of 18-carbon acyl groups, the remainder being provided by all other elongation pathways. In an ancillary study designed to test the accuracy and generality of these results, it was observed that still larger specific depletions occurred at olefinic carbon position in fatty acids from soybeans, thus suggesting that the degradation of substantial quantities of C18 carbon skeletons may be a widespread feature of fatty acid metabolism in eukaryotes. It is suggested that the required degradation is associated with the action of peroxisomes."

Here we describe the isolation, properties, and biological activity of chondronectin prepared from chicken serum. Chondronectin is shown to be a glycoprotein with an estimated Mr = 180,000. After reduction, it migrates as subunits of Mr = 70,000. Antibodies directed against chondronectin inhibited the attachment of chondrocytes to type II collagen. Chondronectin is immunologically distinct from either fibronectin or laminin. Immunofluorescence studies on frozen sections of embryonic chick sternal cartilage and of cultured sternal chondrocytes showed that chondronectin is cell-associated rather than a major matrix component."
https://openalex.org/W2060436818,"Recent studies of the yeast plasmid 2~ circle have been motivated by an appreciation of its potential both as a multicopy yeast-cloning vehicle and as a model system for the study of the control of eucaryotic DNA replication. In addition, the 2~ circle can interconvert between two distinct states by an autocatalyzed. intramolecular recombination. Thus the 21.~ circle has provided a readily accessible system for the analysis of specialized recombination in a eucaryotic cell. The 2~ circle is a 6318 bp double-stranded circular DNA plasmid present at a density of approximately 50 copies per haploid genome in most Saccharomyces strains. Although it has been termed a cytoplasmic element on the basis of its non-Mendelian inheritance, it most likely resides in the nucleoplasm. One manifestation of its nucleoplasmic location is that 2~ circle DNA, like chromosomal DNA, is packaged into nucleosomes by a normal complement of histones. In spite of its location, though, it is unlikely that free 2~ circle DNA ever integrates into a chromosome. The entire 2~ circle genomic sequence was determined recently by Hartley and Donelson (Nature 286, 860-864, 1980). The sequence confirmed earlier observations concerning the structure of the plasmid: it contains two regions, each 599 bp in length, that are precise inverted repeats of each other. These repeated segments divide the molecule into approximately equal halves. The nucleotide sequence of the 2~ circle also revealed three extended, open coding regions within the genome, two in the smaller unique region and one in the larger (open bars in the figure). These three open coding regions correspond in location and orientation to those portions of the genome that are transcribed in yeast into stable poly(A)-con-"
https://openalex.org/W1487493049,"Glutamine 5-phosphoribosylamine pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (amidophosphoribosyltransferase) was purified in large amounts from an Escherichia coli strain harboring a purF hybrid plasmid. Purified E. coli amidophosphoribosyltransferase lacks iron as well as other trace metals as determined by x-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined and is in agreement with that deduced from the DNA sequence. [6-14C] Diazo-5-oxo-norleucine (DON), an active site-directed affinity analog of glutamine, selectively inactivated the glutamine-dependent amidophosphoribosyltransferase. Inactivation was accompanied by incorporation of 1 eq of [6-14C]DON per enzyme subunit. A 10-residue cyanogen bromide peptide labeled by [6-14C]DON was isolated and sequenced. The NH2-terminal cysteine of amidophosphoribosyltransferase was determined to be the residue alkylated by [6-14C]DON. These results establish that the NH2-terminal cysteine is the active site residue required for the glutamine amide transfer function of the enzyme. The experiments reported in this and the preceding article (Tso, J. Y., Zalkin, H., van Cleemput, M., Yanofsky, C., and Smith, J. M. (1982) 257, 3525-3531) demonstrate the application of affinity labeling, rapid peptide purification by high pressure liquid chromatography, and nucleotide sequence determination of a structural gene to localize an amino acid residue, peptide fragment, or functional domain in a long protein chain."
https://openalex.org/W1513191825,"Using a gentle method to prepare complexes of duplex DNA and the recBC enzyme for electron microscopy, structures not seen previously were observed to be associated with the double strand DNA exonuclease activity of the enzyme. These were terminal forms and loop + tail(s) structures. Both individual terminal single-stranded tails and single-stranded regions within duplexes were also observed. Observation of the terminal single-stranded structures present after various reaction conditions and after various potentially disruptive treatments helped to identify those structures which might represent true reaction intermediates. Based on these results and those of previous studies, a modified model for the mechanism of recBC enzyme action on double-stranded, linear DNA is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1529626669,"L-Glutamine causes a dose-related enhancement of insulin release evoked, in rat pancreatic islets, by the nonmetabolized analog of leucine, 2-aminobicyclo-[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH). The influence of BCH upon the metabolism of L-glutamine was investigated. In the islets exposed to L-glutamine, BCH decreased the deamidation of glutamine, but stimulated the oxidative deamination of glutamate, increased the rate of generation and islet content of 2-ketoglutarate, and augmented the oxidation of L-[U-14C]glutamine. BCH antagonized the sparing action of L-glutamine upon the oxidation of endogenous fatty acids. The stimulation of insulin release by the association of L-glutamine and BCH was commensurate with the estimated increase in O2 consumption and coincided with an increase in the islet NADPH/NADP+ ratio, net uptake of 45Ca, and cyclic AMP concentration. It is concluded that insulin release evoked by these amino acids is causally linked to an increase in catabolic fluxes, the secretagogues acting in the islet cells as a fuel (glutamine) or enzyme activator (BCH)."
https://openalex.org/W1592933169,"Ribosomes from Escherichia coli strain Q13 have been photoaffinity labeled with [3H]puromycin in the presence of tetracycline. Puromycin-modified 50 S subunits appear to be identical with untreated subunits in electron micrographs and are precipitated by antibodies to the N6,N6'dimethyladenosine moiety of puromycin. Electron micrographs of subunit-antibody complexes show ribosomal subunits to which an individual antibody molecule is bound and pairs of subunits linked by an IgG molecule. Two regions of puromycin binding have been identified. The primary area, seen in 76% of the ribosome monomer complexes and 93% of the antibody-linked dimers, is beside (or on) the small central protuberance and on the side opposite the L7/L12 arm. A secondary area, maximally distant from the central protuberance, is seen in 22% of the monomeric complexes but only 7% of the antibody-linked dimers. In conjunction with our earlier localization of puromycin binding on the 30 S subunit (Olson, H. M., Grant, P. G., Glitz, D. G., and Cooperman, B. S. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 890-894), we now define a puromycin-binding neighborhood of the 70 S ribosome. In addition to providing evidence for the localization of the peptidyl transferase center within the 50 S subunit, our results contribute to the formulation of a model for tRNA binding to both 30 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2090241432,"The distribution of RNA polymerase B (or II) in native and fixed polytene chromosomes isolated from salivary glands of Chironomus tentans and C. pallidivittatus was investigated by both indirect immunofluorescence and autoradiography. The chromosomes, especially the Balbiani rings (BR2, BR1 and BR3), were examined during periods of stimulated and repressed RNA synthesis. In repressed BR2a and, after the salivary gland chromosomes had been stretched, in various chromosomal segments, it was possible to establish unequivocally that RNA polymerase B is not confined to puffs, but also occurs in interbands. The enzyme was absent from the bands, or at least there was not enough of it to be detected with indirect immunofluorescence. It was shown that the distribution of the indirect immunofluorescence in the chromosomes concurs with that of the 3H-uridine or 3H-UTP labeling. However, RNA polymerase B molecules remain associated with the chromosomal template even after an in vivo alpha-amanitin or actinomycin D treatment to inhibit RNA synthesis. Following heat shocks (37 degrees C to 39 degrees C), transcriptively active RNA polymerase B is still found in interbands, in the BRs and in other puffs that have collapsed as a result of the heat treatment; the greatest enzyme concentrations, however, are in the stimulated heat-shock puffs."

A DNA fragment carrying the putative S10 promoter was cloned into the plasmid mini-Col E1, which contains a transcription termination signal close to the single Hind II site. Cells harboring the hybrid plasmid produced a relatively stable hybrid mRNA with the expected sequence, demonstrating that the promoter functions in vivo. Comparison of the mRNA sequence around the start of the S10 coding region, the presumed target site for L4 repressor protein, with the known binding site for L4 on 23S rRNA revealed the presence of sequence homologies. This supports the model of the translational feedback regulation of the S10 operon by L4."

The K-region epoxide, benz[a]anthracene 5,6-oxide (BA 5,6-oxide) is efficiently inactivated by microsomal epoxide hydrolase, is much less readily inactivated by cytosolic epoxide hydrolase, and is not inactivated by dihydrodiol dehydrogenase.

https://openalex.org/W1606622239,"Photochemical reaction centers isolated from the bacterium Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides are able to donate electrons to cytochromes b6 and f in the plastoquinol,-platocyanin oxidoreductase isolated from spinach chloroplasts. The reduction reactions occur only after the second single turnover flash, in a reaction which is sensitive to inhibitors of the reactions in the chloroplast membranes. When all the components of the b6f complex are oxidized prior to activation, both cytochromes b6 and f are reduced after the second flash. If cytochrome f is reduced prior to activation, cytochrome b6 is still reduced after the second flash, but as the potential is lowered so that the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster is reduced prior to activation, the reduction of cytochrome b6 fails. The b6f complex thus functions in such a way that a two-electron redox couple, probably a quinone, is capable of reducing both cytochrome b6 and cytochrome f, the latter via the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster, in a coupled reaction where both electrons must leave the two-electron carrier. Cytochrome b6 is thus reduced in a manner analogous to oxidant-induced reduction."

The enzyme synthesizes a group of psi residues in the anticodon region of various hisT- isoacceptors and behaves like a eukaryotic homologue of Salmonella tRNA psi synthase I. The thymus enzyme requires a thiol and a monovalent cation (NH4+ or K+) for optimum activity; no energy sources or cofactors are required. The activity is inhibited by single tRNAs or bulk tRNA from all sources tested, and by ribosomal RNAs, various polyribonucleotides, and DNA. The enzyme modifies the two hisT- tRNAPhe isoacceptors, both tRNATyr acceptors and at least five of the tRNALeu isoacceptors to products that coelute with the respective wild type species on reverse-phase columns. With pure hisT- tRNA2Phe as substrate, the enzyme specifically converts residue U39 to psi. Interestingly, a psi residue is still present at position 32, in the anticodon loop of hisT- tRNA2Phe, indicating the existence of other uncharacterized pseudouridylation enzymes in S. typhimurium. These composite results show that the thymus enzyme can form psi at residues 38, 39, and 40 in the anticodon region of appropriate hisT- isoacceptors. During the enzyme purification, a second activity is partially resolved, which releases 3H from wild type S. typhimurium [pyrimidine-5-3H]tRNA. This activity may be associated with an enzyme that pseudouridylates sites that are uniquely modified in eukaryotic tRNAs, but not in Salmonella tRNAs. Our observations support the view that the psi residues in tRNA are synthesized by a family of enzymes, whose members act on uridine residues in specific regions of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1533818506,"The HPL-SK-1 cell line derived from the pleural exudate of a lung cancer patient has been shown to secrete plasminogen activators of very high molecular weights (greater than or equal to 2 and 1 million), as shown by gel filtration on Sepharose 6B or CL-6B. The size of these activators could not be reduced by chromatography in buffers containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 8 M urea, or 1 M KSCN. Goat anti-urokinase antibody inhibited these activators only partially. Trypsin digestion of the 2 million-dalton species yielded several active fragments including one of the size of urokinase, 55,000 daltons. These large activators could be purified only by a double antibody immunoadsorption technique which consisted of the formation of a soluble immune complex between the activators and goat anti-urokinase IgG, followed by the adsorption of this complex to rabbit anti-goat IgG coupled to Affi-Gel 10. The eluted activators were purified 50-fold (2 million daltons) and 130-fold (1 million daltons), respectively. Reduction of the two largest species in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate resulted in the appearance of smaller molecular weight active fragments of differing size, indicating that these activators are disulfide-linked oligomers. Among the fragments of the 2 million-dalton species was found a 10,000-dalton enzyme which had lost activator and antigenic specificity and retained only a non-specific protease activity. A similar fragment was also isolated from reduced, purified 55,000-dalton urinary urokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1540748773,"Cadaverine links covalently to the D-glutamic acid residue of the peptidoglycan in Selenomonas ruminantium, a strictly anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium (Kamio, Y., Itoh, Y., and Terawaki, Y (1981) J. Bacteriol. 146, 49-53). This report describes the enzymatic properties of the particulate enzyme preparation in S. ruminantium which catalyzes the addition of cadaverine to the alpha-carboxyl group of D-glutamic acid residue of the peptidoglycan. Incorporation of cadaverine into the peptidoglycan required UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-meso-2,5-diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-D-Ala-D-Ala (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide(DAP)), UDP-GlcNAc, and ATP. In addition, MgCl2 and cysteine stimulated the reaction. UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide(DAP) could not be substituted for UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala as a precursor of cadaverine-containing peptidoglycan. GlcNAc-MurNAc-pentapeptide(DAP)-lipid (disaccharide-pentapeptide(DAP)-lipid) prepared enzymatically acted as an immediate acceptor of cadaverine in an ATP-dependent reaction in which the alpha-carboxyl group of D-glutamic acid is covalently linked to cadaverine. The [14C]cadaverine-containing disaccharide-pentapeptide(DAP)-lipid was isolated, and used for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan in the absence of cadaverine, ATP, UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide(DAP), and UDP-GlCNAc. The peptidoglycan formed in vitro in the absence of penicillin G was not cross-linked."

https://openalex.org/W1552105367,"Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of dolichol-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine formation and hence an inhibitor of N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, suppressed total proteoglycan synthesis by Swarm rat chondrosarcoma chondrocytes without affecting the size of the proteoglycan molecule, its secretion from the cell, or its ability to be retained in the extracellular matrix. In addition, tunicamycin did not substantially alter the ability of the chondrocytes to polymerize glycosaminoglycan onto an exogenous beta-D-xyloside acceptor. A secondary effect of tunicamycin suppression of proteoglycan synthesis was that a lesser amount of newly synthesized proteoglycan diffused from the extracellular matrix into the culture medium. The ability of exogenous hyaluronic acid and proteoglycan to increase the percentage of newly synthesized 35S-proteoglycan in the medium in tunicamycin-treated cultures indicates that matrix retention of 35S-proteoglycan is related to the total extracellular uronic acid content rather than to the presence or absence of mannose oligosaccharides bound to the proteoglycan molecule. These noncytotoxic concentrations of tunicamycin (33-333 ng/ml) decreased [3H]mannose incorporation to the same extent that they decreased total [35S]sulfate and [3H]serine incorporation, and caused the chondrocyte to synthesize and secrete a species of beta-hexosaminidase that was mannose-deficient as assessed by its failure to bind to concanavalin A. The additional finding of decreased insulin binding to tunicamycin-treated chondrosarcoma chondrocytes suggested that the inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis was due to diminution of receptors which respond to stimulatory hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1524772767,"Aspartate beta-decarboxylase catalyzes abortive decarboxylation/transamination of [2-3H]aspartate with at least 17% internal transfer of tritium to the pro-S position at C-4' of the resulting pyridoxamine phosphate. In the normal beta-decarboxylation reaction, at least 1.06% of the tritium from the alpha-position of aspartate appears in the product alanine. The enzyme catalyzes slow hydrogen exchange from the beta-position of alanine but not aspartate. The replacement of the beta-carboxyl group of aspartate by hydrogen occurs in an inversion mode. These results are interpreted in terms of a two-base mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2091490468,There is evidence that the neuroendocrine system can be modulated by endogenous opioid peptides (for a review see ref. 1). Recently Rotsztejn et al.2 have ruled out a direct effect of Met-enkephalin on release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Instead they postulated that Met-enkephalin inhibits the secretion of dopamine from dopaminergic neurones thereby reducing the dopamine-stimulated release of GnRH from the hypothalamus. We report here evidence that GnRH can itself supress dopamine synthesis in the rat. The fact that the dopamine neurone and GnRH-secreting cell are adjacent to each other3 suggests a feedback mechanism of regulating GnRH release.
https://openalex.org/W1558904865,"Yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase is a nuclear-coded protein of approximately 90,000 daltons comprised of two 45,000-dalton subunits of pI 6.9 to 7.0. To investigate the nature of the initial translation product of the RNA polymerase, we have analyzed those products of a cell-free translation system directed by yeast RNA that are immunoreactive with antibodies to the 45,000-dalton peptide of polymerase. A precursor of one or more of the subunits of the polymerase, 2,000 daltons later than the mature product, has been characterized using immunoreaction, immunocompetition, and peptide digestion. The role of transcription of the polymerase gene in catabolite repression of mitochondrial development has been investigated by analyzing the changes in cell-free synthesis of the RNA polymerase precursor during glucose and raffinose growth. The results indicate an increase in precursor synthesis and probably in the corresponding transcript abundance during glucose derepression. In contrast, the precursor is present at high levels until stationary phase during raffinose growth. These data indicate the involvement of increased transcription of the polymerase gene in the process of derepression."
https://openalex.org/W1603975875,"The complete amino acid sequence of the group-specific antigen gene-encoded RNA binding phosphoprotein p12 has been determined for both Rauscher and Moloney leukemia viruses. Large fragments generated by acid, and cyanogen bromide and hydroxylamine cleavage, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion were subjected to automated sequencing. Both Rauscher and Moloney p12 are composed of 84 amino acids arranged in alternating variable and conserved regions. The homology between the conserved internal and COOH-terminal regions is greater than 95%, but the NH2-terminal and internal variable regions show 59 and 51% homology, respectively. The role of such regions in the type-specific biological activities of these molecules is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1520052511,"Rat liver 5 S and 5.8 S rRNAs were oxidized with periodate and the 3' termini were coupled to Sepharose 4B through an adipic acid dihydrazide spacer. Ribosomal proteins were passed through the nucleic acid affinity columns to form ribonucleoprotein complexes containing the nucleic acid and the proteins that bind to it (5 S . L6, L7, L19; and 5.8 S . L6, L19, S9, S13). Pure isoaccepting species of yeast initiator-tRNA (tRNAfMet) and elongator-tRNAs (tRNAmMet, and tRNAPhe) were chromatographed on the ribosomal ribonucleoprotein affinity columns. The three rRNAs were bound to the 5 S and 5.8 S ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes. The elongation and initiation ternary complexes, EF-1 alpha . GTP . Phe-tRNAPhe, and eIF-2 . GTP . Met-tRNAfMet, also were bound to both ribosomal ribonucleoprotein affinity columns, whereas the binary complex EF-1 alpha . GTP and puromycin were not."
https://openalex.org/W2007517083,"Microelectronics and computers are in use in virtually every aspect of modern medicine. Computers are used widely in medical research, where an important need is for better microelectronic sensors for data acquisition. In medical practice, data collection from patients as well as subsequent storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data are enhanced by the computer. In medical decision-making computers improve accuracy, increase cost efficiency, and advance understanding of the structure of medical knowledge and of the decision-making process itself. Powerful new noninvasive diagnostic instruments including x-ray tomographic scanners and ultrasonic imaging systems are based on computers. The efficiency and scope of clinical laboratory procedures and advanced analytical instruments are greatly increased by computerization, and careful application of computers has improved the interpretation of diagnostic tests, such as the electrocardiogram, and monitoring of critically ill patients. The powerful sensory, computational, memory, and display capabilities of microcomputer systems and their compact size offer new opportunities to relieve functional deficiencies associated with loss of limbs, paralysis, speech impediments, deafness, and blindness."
