https://openalex.org/W2283727311,"The identification of properties that contribute to the persistence and resilience of ecosystems despite climate change constitutes a research priority of global relevance. Here we present a novel, empirical approach to assess the relative sensitivity of ecosystems to climate variability, one property of resilience that builds on theoretical modelling work recognizing that systems closer to critical thresholds respond more sensitively to external perturbations. We develop a new metric, the vegetation sensitivity index, that identifies areas sensitive to climate variability over the past 14 years. The metric uses time series data derived from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index, and three climatic variables that drive vegetation productivity (air temperature, water availability and cloud cover). Underlying the analysis is an autoregressive modelling approach used to identify climate drivers of vegetation productivity on monthly timescales, in addition to regions with memory effects and reduced response rates to external forcing. We find ecologically sensitive regions with amplified responses to climate variability in the Arctic tundra, parts of the boreal forest belt, the tropical rainforest, alpine regions worldwide, steppe and prairie regions of central Asia and North and South America, the Caatinga deciduous forest in eastern South America, and eastern areas of Australia. Our study provides a quantitative methodology for assessing the relative response rate of ecosystems--be they natural or with a strong anthropogenic signature--to environmental variability, which is the first step towards addressing why some regions appear to be more sensitive than others, and what impact this has on the resilience of ecosystem service provision and human well-being."

Here we analyse the genomes of a Neanderthal and a Denisovan from the Altai Mountains in Siberia together with the sequences of chromosome 21 of two Neanderthals from Spain and Croatia. We find that a population that diverged early from other modern humans in Africa contributed genetically to the ancestors of Neanderthals from the Altai Mountains roughly 100,000 years ago. By contrast, we do not detect such a genetic contribution in the Denisovan or the two European Neanderthals. We conclude that in addition to later interbreeding events, the ancestors of Neanderthals from the Altai Mountains and early modern humans met and interbred, possibly in the Near East, many thousands of years earlier than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2273816628,"Because autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders and patients typically display symptoms before the age of three, one of the key questions in autism research is whether the pathology is reversible in adults. Here we investigate the developmental requirement of Shank3 in mice, a prominent monogenic autism gene that is estimated to contribute to approximately 1% of all autism spectrum disorder cases. SHANK3 is a postsynaptic scaffold protein that regulates synaptic development, function and plasticity by orchestrating the assembly of postsynaptic density macromolecular signalling complex. Disruptions of the Shank3 gene in mouse models have resulted in synaptic defects and autistic-like behaviours including anxiety, social interaction deficits, and repetitive behaviour. We generated a novel Shank3 conditional knock-in mouse model, and show that re-expression of the Shank3 gene in adult mice led to improvements in synaptic protein composition, spine density and neural function in the striatum. We also provide behavioural evidence that certain behavioural abnormalities including social interaction deficit and repetitive grooming behaviour could be rescued, while anxiety and motor coordination deficit could not be recovered in adulthood. Together, these results reveal the profound effect of post-developmental activation of Shank3 expression on neural function, and demonstrate a certain degree of continued plasticity in the adult diseased brain."
https://openalex.org/W2278391238,"Discovering pharmaceutical candidates is a resource-intensive enterprise that frequently requires the parallel synthesis of hundreds or even thousands of molecules. C-H bonds are present in almost all pharmaceutical agents. Consequently, the development of selective, rapid and efficient methods for converting these bonds into new chemical entities has the potential to streamline pharmaceutical development. Saturated nitrogen-containing heterocycles (alicyclic amines) feature prominently in pharmaceuticals, such as treatments for depression (paroxetine, amitifadine), diabetes (gliclazide), leukaemia (alvocidib), schizophrenia (risperidone, belaperidone), malaria (mefloquine) and nicotine addiction (cytisine, varenicline). However, existing methods for the C-H functionalization of saturated nitrogen heterocycles, particularly at sites remote to nitrogen, remain extremely limited. Here we report a transannular approach to selectively manipulate the C-H bonds of alicyclic amines at sites remote to nitrogen. Our reaction uses the boat conformation of the substrates to achieve palladium-catalysed amine-directed conversion of C-H bonds to C-C bonds on various alicyclic amine scaffolds. We demonstrate this approach by synthesizing new derivatives of several bioactive molecules, including varenicline."
https://openalex.org/W2277747292,"The mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) family of proteins (including MLL1-MLL4, SET1A and SET1B) specifically methylate histone 3 Lys4, and have pivotal roles in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in haematopoiesis and development. The methyltransferase activity of MLL1, by itself severely compromised, is stimulated by the three conserved factors WDR5, RBBP5 and ASH2L, which are shared by all MLL family complexes. However, the molecular mechanism of how these factors regulate the activity of MLL proteins still remains poorly understood. Here we show that a minimized human RBBP5-ASH2L heterodimer is the structural unit that interacts with and activates all MLL family histone methyltransferases. Our structural, biochemical and computational analyses reveal a two-step activation mechanism of MLL family proteins. These findings provide unprecedented insights into the common theme and functional plasticity in complex assembly and activity regulation of MLL family methyltransferases, and also suggest a universal regulation mechanism for most histone methyltransferases."

https://openalex.org/W2285270887,"Reversible, cell-intrinsic mechanisms that depend on a new sex differentiation pathway act in adult somatic cells of the Drosophila intestine to govern sex-specific differences in organ size, plasticity during reproduction, and response to tumorigenic insults. Development and hormonal factors are known contributors to sex differences in physiology. Irene Miguel-Aliaga and colleagues describe a previously unrecognized sex-differentiation pathway acting in somatic stem cells of the Drosophila intestine to govern sex-specific differences in organ size, plasticity during reproduction, and response to tumorigenic insults. This finding suggests that the intrinsic sexual identity of adult intestinal stem cells can play a key role in adult life, both in maintaining organ size and in modulating its plasticity. Sex differences in physiology and disease susceptibility are commonly attributed to developmental and/or hormonal factors, but there is increasing realization that cell-intrinsic mechanisms play important and persistent roles1,2. Here we use the Drosophila melanogaster intestine to investigate the nature and importance of cellular sex in an adult somatic organ in vivo. We find that the adult intestinal epithelium is a cellular mosaic of different sex differentiation pathways, and displays extensive sex differences in expression of genes with roles in growth and metabolism. Cell-specific reversals of the sexual identity of adult intestinal stem cells uncovers the key role this identity has in controlling organ size, reproductive plasticity and response to genetically induced tumours. Unlike previous examples of sexually dimorphic somatic stem cell activity, the sex differences in intestinal stem cell behaviour arise from intrinsic mechanisms that control cell cycle duration and involve a new doublesex- and fruitless-independent branch of the sex differentiation pathway downstream of transformer. Together, our findings indicate that the plasticity of an adult somatic organ is reversibly controlled by its sexual identity, imparted by a new mechanism that may be active in more tissues than previously recognized."

https://openalex.org/W2284549295,"A small molecule, inhibitor of a protein–protein interaction between the transcription factor Pdr1 and the Med15 subunit of Mediator in the fungal pathogen Candida glabrata, is identified and characterized here; the compound iKIX1 inhibits Pdr1-mediated gene activation and resensitizes drug-resistant C. glabrata to azole antifungals in vitro and in animal models of disseminated and urinary tract infection. Joy Nishikawa et al. report the identification and characterization of a small-molecule inhibitor of a protein–protein interaction between the transcription factor Pdr1 and the MED15 subunit of Mediator in the fungal pathogen Candida glabrata. The lead compound, iKIX1, inhibits Pdr1-mediated gene activation and re-sensitizes drug-resistant C. glabrata to azole antifungals in vitro and in animal models of disseminated and urinary tract infection. The NMR structure of the interaction between Mediator and Pdr1, has also improved our understanding of the mechanism of gene activation by Pdr1 and its inhibition by iKIX1. Eukaryotic transcription activators stimulate the expression of specific sets of target genes through recruitment of co-activators such as the RNA polymerase II-interacting Mediator complex1,2. Aberrant function of transcription activators has been implicated in several diseases. However, therapeutic targeting efforts have been hampered by a lack of detailed molecular knowledge of the mechanisms of gene activation by disease-associated transcription activators. We previously identified an activator-targeted three-helix bundle KIX domain in the human MED15 Mediator subunit that is structurally conserved in Gal11/Med15 Mediator subunits in fungi3,4. The Gal11/Med15 KIX domain engages pleiotropic drug resistance transcription factor (Pdr1) orthologues, which are key regulators of the multidrug resistance pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in the clinically important human pathogen Candida glabrata5,6. The prevalence of C. glabrata is rising, partly owing to its low intrinsic susceptibility to azoles, the most widely used antifungal agent7,8. Drug-resistant clinical isolates of C. glabrata most commonly contain point mutations in Pdr1 that render it constitutively active9,10,11,12,13,14, suggesting that this transcriptional activation pathway represents a linchpin in C. glabrata multidrug resistance. Here we perform sequential biochemical and in vivo high-throughput screens to identify small-molecule inhibitors of the interaction of the C. glabrata Pdr1 activation domain with the C. glabrata Gal11A KIX domain. The lead compound (iKIX1) inhibits Pdr1-dependent gene activation and re-sensitizes drug-resistant C. glabrata to azole antifungals in vitro and in animal models for disseminated and urinary tract C. glabrata infection. Determining the NMR structure of the C. glabrata Gal11A KIX domain provides a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of Pdr1 gene activation and multidrug resistance inhibition by iKIX1. We have demonstrated the feasibility of small-molecule targeting of a transcription factor-binding site in Mediator as a novel therapeutic strategy in fungal infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W2283063420,"Many threatened species rely on ecotourism for conservation funding, but simultaneously suffer direct ecological impacts from ecotourism. For a range of IUCN-Redlisted terrestrial and marine bird and mammal species worldwide, we use population viability analyses to calculate the net effects of ecotourism on expected time to extinction, in the presence of other anthropogenic threats such as poaching, primary industries and habitat loss. Species for which these calculations are currently possible, for one or more subpopulations, include: orangutan, hoolock gibbon, golden lion tamarin, cheetah, African wild dog, New Zealand sealion, great green macaw, Egyptian vulture, and African penguin. For some but not all of these species, tourism can extend expected survival time, i.e., benefits outweigh impacts. Precise outcomes depend strongly on population parameters and starting sizes, predation, and ecotourism scale and mechanisms. Tourism does not currently overcome other major conservation threats associated with natural resource extractive industries. Similar calculations for other threatened species are currently limited by lack of basic population data."
https://openalex.org/W2283333184,"Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a protozoan parasite present in around a third of the human population. Infected individuals are commonly asymptomatic, though recent reports have suggested that infection might influence aspects of the host's behavior. In particular, Toxoplasma infection has been linked to schizophrenia, suicide attempt, differences in aspects of personality and poorer neurocognitive performance. However, these studies are often conducted in clinical samples or convenience samples.In a population-representative birth-cohort of individuals tested for presence of antibodies to T. gondii (N = 837) we investigated the association between infection and four facets of human behavior: neuropsychiatric disorder (schizophrenia and major depression), poor impulse control (suicidal behavior and criminality), personality, and neurocognitive performance. Suicide attempt was marginally more frequent among individuals with T. gondii seropositivity (p = .06). Seropositive individuals also performed worse on one out of 14 measures of neuropsychological function.On the whole, there was little evidence that T. gondii was related to increased risk of psychiatric disorder, poor impulse control, personality aberrations or neurocognitive impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2275651183,"An unexpected octameric integrase architecture for the betaretrovirus mouse mammary tumour virus intasome. Integration of reverse-transcribed viral DNA into the host genome is an essential step in the life cycle of retroviruses, catalysed by the protein integrase. Two studies, from the laboratories of Hideki Aihara and Alan Engelman, have used crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of Rous sarcoma virus and mouse mammary tumour virus intasomes, the complex containing integrase, viral DNA, and target DNA. They find that integrase is an octameric assembly — not a tetramer as previously reported. A pair of core integrase dimers engages the viral DNA ends for catalysis, while another pair of non-catalytic integrase dimers bridge the two viral DNA molecules and help capture target DNA. The flanking, unanticipated pair of integrase dimers are required for target capture and strand transfer. Retroviral integrase catalyses the integration of viral DNA into host target DNA, which is an essential step in the life cycle of all retroviruses1. Previous structural characterization of integrase–viral DNA complexes, or intasomes, from the spumavirus prototype foamy virus revealed a functional integrase tetramer2,3,4,5, and it is generally believed that intasomes derived from other retroviral genera use tetrameric integrase6,7,8,9. However, the intasomes of orthoretroviruses, which include all known pathogenic species, have not been characterized structurally. Here, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, we determine an unexpected octameric integrase architecture for the intasome of the betaretrovirus mouse mammary tumour virus. The structure is composed of two core integrase dimers, which interact with the viral DNA ends and structurally mimic the integrase tetramer of prototype foamy virus, and two flanking integrase dimers that engage the core structure via their integrase carboxy-terminal domains. Contrary to the belief that tetrameric integrase components are sufficient to catalyse integration, the flanking integrase dimers were necessary for mouse mammary tumour virus integrase activity. The integrase octamer solves a conundrum for betaretroviruses as well as alpharetroviruses by providing critical carboxy-terminal domains to the intasome core that cannot be provided in cis because of evolutionarily restrictive catalytic core domain–carboxy-terminal domain linker regions. The octameric architecture of the intasome of mouse mammary tumour virus provides new insight into the structural basis of retroviral DNA integration."
https://openalex.org/W2282163239,"The contribution of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets to sea level has increased in recent decades, largely owing to the thinning and retreat of outlet glaciers and ice streams. This dynamic loss is a serious concern, with some modelling studies suggesting that the collapse of a major ice sheet could be imminent or potentially underway in West Antarctica, but others predicting a more limited response. A major problem is that observations used to initialize and calibrate models typically span only a few decades, and, at the ice-sheet scale, it is unclear how the entire drainage network of ice streams evolves over longer timescales. This represents one of the largest sources of uncertainty when predicting the contributions of ice sheets to sea-level rise. A key question is whether ice streams might increase and sustain rates of mass loss over centuries or millennia, beyond those expected for a given ocean-climate forcing. Here we reconstruct the activity of 117 ice streams that operated at various times during deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (from about 22,000 to 7,000 years ago) and show that as they activated and deactivated in different locations, their overall number decreased, they occupied a progressively smaller percentage of the ice sheet perimeter and their total discharge decreased. The underlying geology and topography clearly influenced ice stream activity, but--at the ice-sheet scale--their drainage network adjusted and was linked to changes in ice sheet volume. It is unclear whether these findings can be directly translated to modern ice sheets. However, contrary to the view that sees ice streams as unstable entities that can accelerate ice-sheet deglaciation, we conclude that ice streams exerted progressively less influence on ice sheet mass balance during the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet."
https://openalex.org/W2282549557,"Integration of the reverse-transcribed viral DNA into the host genome is an essential step in the life cycle of retroviruses. Retrovirus integrase catalyses insertions of both ends of the linear viral DNA into a host chromosome. Integrase from HIV-1 and closely related retroviruses share the three-domain organization, consisting of a catalytic core domain flanked by amino- and carboxy-terminal domains essential for the concerted integration reaction. Although structures of the tetrameric integrase-DNA complexes have been reported for integrase from prototype foamy virus featuring an additional DNA-binding domain and longer interdomain linkers, the architecture of a canonical three-domain integrase bound to DNA remained elusive. Here we report a crystal structure of the three-domain integrase from Rous sarcoma virus in complex with viral and target DNAs. The structure shows an octameric assembly of integrase, in which a pair of integrase dimers engage viral DNA ends for catalysis while another pair of non-catalytic integrase dimers bridge between the two viral DNA molecules and help capture target DNA. The individual domains of the eight integrase molecules play varying roles to hold the complex together, making an extensive network of protein-DNA and protein-protein contacts that show both conserved and distinct features compared with those observed for prototype foamy virus integrase. Our work highlights the diversity of retrovirus intasome assembly and provides insights into the mechanisms of integration by HIV-1 and related retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2337677213,"Genome-wide association studies as well as murine models have shown that the interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) pathway plays a pivotal role in chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, and type 1 diabetes. Genome-wide association studies and targeted re-sequencing studies have revealed the presence of multiple potentially causal variants of the IL23R. Specifically the G149R, V362I, and R381Q IL23Rα chain variants are linked to protection against the development of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in humans. Moreover, the exact mechanism of action of these receptor variants has not been elucidated. We show that all three of these IL23Rα variants cause a reduction in IL23 receptor activation-mediated phosphorylation of the signal-transducing activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and phosphorylation of signal transducing activator of transcription 4 (STAT4). The reduction in signaling is due to lower levels of cell surface receptor expression. For G149R, the receptor retention in the endoplasmic reticulum is due to an impairment of receptor maturation, whereas the R381Q and V362I variants have reduced protein stability. Finally, we demonstrate that the endogenous expression of IL23Rα protein from V362I and R381Q variants in human lymphoblastoid cell lines exhibited lower expression levels relative to susceptibility alleles.

https://openalex.org/W2439565516,"The mechanism of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, involved in poststroke edema and hemorrhagic transformation, is important but elusive. We investigated microRNA-150 (miR-150)-mediated mechanism in the disruption of BBB after stroke in rats. We found that up-regulation of miR-150 increased permeability of BBB as detected by MRI after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in vivo as well as increased permeability of brain microvascular endothelial cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro. The expression of claudin-5, a key tight junction protein, was decreased in the ischemic boundary zone after up-regulation of miR-150. We found in brain microvascular endothelial cells that overexpression of miR-150 decreased not only cell survival rate but also the expression levels of claudin-5 after oxygen-glucose deprivation. With dual-luciferase assay, we confirmed that miR-150 could directly regulate the angiopoietin receptor Tie-2. Moreover, silencing Tie-2 with lentivirus-delivered small interfering RNA reversed the effect of miR-150 on endothelial permeability, cell survival, and claudin-5 expression. Furthermore, poststroke treatment with antagomir-150, a specific miR-150 antagonist, contributed to BBB protection, infarct volume reduction, and amelioration of neurologic deficits. Collectively, our findings suggested that miR-150 could regulate claudin-5 expression and endothelial cell survival by targeting Tie-2, thus affecting the permeability of BBB after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, and that miR-150 might be a potential alternative target for the treatment of stroke.-Fang, Z., He, Q.-W., Li, Q., Chen, X.-L., Baral, S., Jin, H.-J., Zhu, Y.-Y., Li, M., Xia, Y.-P., Mao, L., Hu, B.

Recently, mNT has been implicated in cytosolic Fe-S repair of a key regulator of cellular iron homeostasis. Here, we aimed to decipher the mechanism by which mNT triggers its Fe-S repair capacity. By using tightly controlled reactions combined with complementary spectroscopic approaches, we have determined the differential roles played by both the redox state of the mNT cluster and dioxygen in cluster transfer and protein stability. We unambiguously demonstrated that only the oxidized state of the mNT cluster triggers cluster transfer to a generic acceptor protein and that dioxygen is neither required for the cluster transfer reaction nor does it affect the transfer rate. In the absence of apo-acceptors, a large fraction of the oxidized holo-mNT form is converted back to reduced holo-mNT under low oxygen tension. Reduced holo-mNT, which holds a [2Fe-2S]+ with a global protein fold similar to that of the oxidized form is, by contrast, resistant in losing its cluster or in transferring it. Our findings thus demonstrate that mNT uses an iron-based redox switch mechanism to regulate the transfer of its cluster. The oxidized state is the “active state,” which reacts promptly to initiate Fe-S transfer independently of dioxygen, whereas the reduced state is a “dormant form.” Finally, we propose that the redox-sensing function of mNT is a key component of the cellular adaptive response to help stress-sensitive Fe-S proteins recover from oxidative injury.

Recently, it has been proposed that mNT plays a specific role in cytosolic Fe-S cluster repair of IRP-1, a key regulator of cellular iron homeostasis in mammalian cells (13.Ferecatu I. Gonçalves S.

However, it was not possible to identify which parameters, i.e. the redox state of the cluster or the presence of dioxygen (O2), are important for cluster transfer and lability. Furthermore, no biophysical data have been provided on the reduced state of mNT or on protein behavior during the transfer process. In the present study we decided to investigate in depth the respective roles played by the mNT cluster redox state and by dioxygen in these matters. Using a tightly controlled reaction mixture, we unambiguously demonstrated that only the oxidized state of the mNT cluster triggers its transfer to a model receptor protein, without global conformational change of the protein. The transfer process is totally independent of dioxygen and exhibits a conformational switch from a well folded holoprotein to an unfolded apo-form. In contrast, the stability of oxidized holo-mNT is greatly modulated by dioxygen. Finally, we propose that mNT acts as a redox switch to transfer its cluster, the reduced state being the dormant physiological state, whereas the oxidized state is active after oxidative insults and reacts promptly to initiate Fe-S transfer. Recombinant human mNT33–108 and mNT44–108 lacking the 32 and the 43 N-terminal amino acids, respectively, were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (13.Ferecatu I. Gonçalves S. Golinelli-Cohen M.P. Clémancey M. Martelli A. Riquier S. Guittet E. Latour J.M. Puccio H. Drapier J.C. Lescop E. Bouton C.

Protein purity was assessed to be >99% using SDS-PAGE and with an optical A280 nm/A458 nm ratio near 2.3. The mNT44–108 form contains eight additional C-terminal residues derived from the His tag (LEHHHHHH), whereas the mNT33–108 form contains, after thrombin cleavage, three additional N-terminal residues derived from the cleavage site (GSH). All the experiments were performed with the mNT44–108 form, with the sole exception of the Mössbauer studies performed with the mNT33–108 form. For NMR analyses, mNT44–108 was expressed on a 1-liter scale in M9 minimal medium (containing 0.001% thiamine-HCl and 10 μm FeCl3), supplemented with 1.0 g of 15NH4Cl and 4.0 g of d-[13C]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. For Mössbauer analyses, mNT33–108 was expressed in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 57Fe-enriched ferric chloride. The E. coli apoferredoxin (FDX, full-length construct in pET21b, a gift from Dr. S. Ollagnier de Choudens, Grenoble, France) was expressed and purified as previously described (14.Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Cloning, sequencing, and overexpression of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin gene from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (15.Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) or absorbance at 280 nm of guanidine-denatured protein using 7115 and 7365 m−1·cm−1 (ProtParam) as the extinction coefficient for mNT44–108 and FDX, respectively. All protein concentrations were calculated based on monomer equivalents. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded between 240 and 900 nm with Cary 100 (Agilent) or Safas mc2 (Monaco) spectrophotometers equipped with a temperature control apparatus set to the desired temperature. For spectra recorded under anaerobic conditions, the cuvette was prepared in a glove box and closed with a septum. Mössbauer spectra of purified 57Fe-labeled mNT33–108 were recorded at 4.2 K both in a low field Mössbauer spectrometer equipped with a Janis SVT-400 cryostat and low field permanent magnets and a high field Mössbauer spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments Spectromag 4000 cryostat containing an 8-tesla split-pair superconducting magnet (16.Carboni M. Clémancey M. Molton F. Pécaut J. Lebrun C. Dubois L. Blondin G. Latour J.M. Biologically relevant heterodinuclear iron-manganese complexes.Inorg. Chem. 2012; 51: 10447-10460Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The spectrometer was operated in constant acceleration mode in transmission geometry. The isomer shifts are referenced against that of the room temperature metallic iron foil. Data were analyzed with the program WMOSS (WEB Research, Edina, MN). For resonance Raman spectroscopy, 50-μl samples of native mNT44–108 (200 μm) were prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl. When required, buffer was made anaerobic by a 2-h flushing with N2 gas. Anaerobic mNT samples were prepared by performing 20 vacuum/N2 refilling cycles 4 times every 5 min. The mNT cluster was reduced by adding excess dithionite (5 mm final). Solutions were conditioned in gas-tight quartz EPR tubes and disposed in a homemade spinning cell at room temperature to avoid local heating and to prevent photodissociation and degradation. Raman excitation at 441.6 nm was obtained with a helium-cadmium laser (Kimmon, Tokyo, Japan). Laser power was set at 30 milliwatts. Resonance Raman spectra were recorded using a modified single-stage spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon T64000, HORIBA Jobin Yvon S.A.S., Chilly Mazarin, France) equipped with a liquid N2-cooled back-thinned CCD detector. Stray scattered light was rejected using a holographic notch filter (Kaiser Optical Systems, Ann Arbor, MI). Slit width was set at 100 μm. Spectra were recorded as the co-addition of 60 individual spectra with CCD exposure times of 60 s each. Four successive sets of such spectra, obtained with two distinct samples, were then averaged. Spectral accuracy was estimated to be ∼1 cm−1. Spectral resolution was about 3 cm−1. Baseline correction was performed using GRAMS 32 software (Galactic Industries, Salem, NH). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were carried out using a Bruker Avance III 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Two-dimensional 1H,15N SOFAST-HMQC spectra (17.Schanda P. Kupce E. Brutscher B. SOFAST-HMQC experiments for recording two-dimensional heteronuclear correlation spectra of proteins within a few seconds.J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 33: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) were recorded using a 250 μm His-tagged 13C,15N-labeled holo-mNT44–108 protein sample at 298 K in the specified buffers. When experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions, an NMR tube equipped with a valve to maintain anaerobic conditions was used. To extend the backbone assignment from a previous study (18.Zhou T. Lin J. Feng Y. Wang J. Binding of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate destabilizes the iron-sulfur clusters of human mitoNEET.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 9604-9612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a set of additional BEST-type triple resonance experiments (19.Lescop E. Schanda P. Brutscher B. A set of BEST triple-resonance experiments for time-optimized protein resonance assignment.J. Magn. Reson. 2007; 187: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) was carried out, including HNCO, HN(CO)CA, HNCA, HN(CO)CACB, HNCACB, and HN(CA)CO. Reaction buffers comprised 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm Bis-Tris pH 6.2 and were prepared under the conditions specified under “Results.” Reactions were followed by UV-visible absorption or NMR spectroscopies, or by migration of aliquots taken at specific times on a 16% native PAGE gel run under aerobic conditions and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue. For the cluster transfer reaction, apo-FDX was prepared by heat cluster disassembly at 90 °C of purified holo-FDX in the presence of 10 mm DTT and 10 mm EDTA followed by purification on a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl. Apo-FDX was preincubated with 5 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature under anaerobic conditions to ensure cysteine reduction. When specified, DTT was removed, and buffer was exchanged with 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.2, 100 mm NaCl using a Micro Bio-Spin Size Exclusion column (Bio-Rad). The 240–900-nm absorption spectra of the reaction were recorded over time and corrected for baseline variations at 900 nm. We paid particular attention to changes in absorbance at 458 nm and 415 nm, which are characteristic of the [2Fe-2S] cluster bound to mNT and FDX, respectively. At time t, the extent of the cluster transfer was determined using the ratio R(t) = A415/A458, whereas the extent of loss of the mNT cluster was determined using R(t) = A458. Reaction progress at time t was estimated as (R(t) − Rinitial)/(Rfinal − Rinitial), with Rinitial, the initial R value at time 0, and Rfinal, the R value at the time necessary for reaction completion. Free and total iron was quantified using a bathophenanthroline colorimetric assay (20.Moulis J.M. Meyer J. Characterization of the selenium-substituted 2 [4Fe-4Se] ferredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum.Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4762-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For total iron quantification of a 100-μl sample, 10 μl of perchloric acid 54%, 72 μl of bathophenanthroline 1.7 mg/ml, 18 μl of sodium ascorbate 76 mg/ml, 10 μl of saturated ammonium acetate solution, and 140 μl of water were added. After 15 min at room temperature, the absorbance at 535 nm was measured. Free iron quantification was performed on a 250-μl sample using the same protocol except that perchloric acid and water were not added. In previous studies, a role for mNT in Fe-S transfer/repair to apo-acceptors has been proposed (12.Zuris J.A. Harir Y. Conlan A.R. Shvartsman M. Michaeli D. Tamir S. Paddock M.L. Onuchic J.N.

However, a clear distinction could not be drawn between the specific role of dioxygen in the cluster transfer reaction and the role played by the redox state of the mNT Fe-S cluster, because these studies were performed under aerobic conditions with the oxidized form of mNT and under anaerobic conditions with the reduced form. To address this issue, we first compared, under aerobiosis and anaerobiosis, the ability of oxidized holo-mNT to transfer its cluster to E. coli [2Fe-2S] FDX, a protein widely used as a model recipient protein (21.Bonomi F. Iametti S. Ta D. Vickery L.E. Multiple turnover transfer of [2Fe2S] clusters by the iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold proteins IscU and IscA.J. Biol.

Soc. 2009; 131: 6149-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To set up the cluster transfer reaction, apo-FDX was reduced by DTT, and the reductant was removed. Then, thiol-reduced apo-FDX was mixed with oxidized holo-mNT under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and Fe-S transfer was followed using UV-visible absorption (Fig. 1A). As apo-FDX does not absorb in the 300–650-nm wavelength range, the initial spectra in Fig. 1A (black curves) of both mixtures were characteristic of the oxidized holo-mNT, with absorption peaks at 338, 458, and 542 nm (9.Wiley S.E. Paddock M.L. Abresch E.C. Gross L. van der Geer P. Nechushtai R. Murphy A.N. Jennings P.A. Dixon J.E. The outer mitochondrial membrane protein mitoNEET contains a novel redox-active 2Fe-2S cluster.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23745-23749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The characteristic 415-nm band of oxidized holo-FDX (see UV-visible absorption spectrum of oxidized holo-FDX in Fig. 1B) progressively increased over time in aerobiosis and anaerobiosis and reached a plateau after ∼3 h. Analysis of the reaction end products on a native gel confirmed the switch from the holo- to apo-form of mNT and vice versa for FDX regardless of the aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Fig. 1C). This first set of experiments clearly demonstrates that dioxygen is not necessary for the cluster transfer mechanism. In a second step, the effect of dioxygen on the rate of cluster transfer was carefully determined by examining the change over time of the ratio of the absorbances at 415 and 458 nm, which reflects the transfer reaction progress, under aerobiosis and anaerobiosis. As shown in Fig. 1D, left panel, dioxygen per se did not affect the rate of Fe-S transfer by mNT (t½ = 25 ± 6 min for both conditions). In parallel, the effect of dioxygen on the [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster lability of mNT was investigated. We prepared a solution of holo-mNT and followed the change in absorbance at 458 nm over time. Only roughly 10% of the proteins underwent cluster loss after 900 min under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 1D, right panel, squares). By contrast, the rate of cluster loss was increased ∼20-fold in the presence of dioxygen (Fig. 1D, right panel, circles), with a t½ of 360 ± 50 min under aerobic conditions. Altogether, these data unambiguously demonstrate that although cluster instability of oxidized holo-mNT is strongly increased by dioxygen, the latter did not bear on the initiation and/or the rate of the mNT cluster transfer reaction. Once the role of dioxygen in the Fe-S transfer reaction was ruled out (Fig. 1), we decided to focus on how mNT cluster redox state triggers Fe-S transfer using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. We first took advantage of the limited reducing capacity of DTT at pH below 7 (24.Cleland W.W. Dithiothreitol, a new protective reagent for Sh groups.Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar) and checked that the addition of DTT at pH 6.2 to the oxidized holo-mNT did not affect the spectrum (Fig. 2A, gray dotted curve versus gray curve). In contrast, the addition of DTT at pH 8.0 profoundly modified the spectrum (black dotted curve), which was characteristic of the reduced holo-mNT form (Fig. 2A, black curve) (9.Wiley S.E. Paddock M.L. Abresch E.C. Gross L. van der Geer P. Nechushtai R. Murphy A.N. Jennings P.A. Dixon J.E. The outer mitochondrial membrane protein mitoNEET contains a novel redox-active 2Fe-2S cluster.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23745-23749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In a second step we used this pH-dependent reducing property of DTT to carefully examine the influence of mNT cluster redox state on the cluster transfer reaction. Two Fe-S transfer experiments were performed in parallel under anaerobiosis (Fig. 2B). The reaction mixtures were identical in composition (e.g. holo-mNT, apo-FDX, and DTT in buffer at pH 6.2) except that they differed in the redox state of the holo-mNT. In mixture 1, DTT was added to mNT diluted in the transfer buffer at pH 6.2 (no reduction), whereas in mixture 2, DTT was added to mNT at pH 8.0 before dilution in the transfer buffer at pH 6.2 (reduction). We showed that Fe-S transfer occurred only in mixture 1 and that the progress of the reaction was identical to that of the control reaction without DTT (Fig. 2B, compare triangles and crosses). In mixture 2, in which holo-mNT was reduced by DTT, the A415/A458 ratio decreased slightly under anaerobiosis, reflecting a very limited reoxidation of the mNT cluster. After exposure to air at 50 min, the A415/A458 ratio rapidly dropped in response to Fe-S cluster reoxidation, and the Fe-S transfer was then possible (Fig. 2B, circles). Altogether, these data unambiguously demonstrate the key role of the [2Fe-2S]2+ state of the mNT cluster as a crucial signal in allowing Fe-S transfer to be processed. The oxidized form of holo-mNT, which mediates Fe-S transfer, has been well characterized in vitro (13.Ferecatu I. Gonçalves S. Golinelli-Cohen M.P. Clémancey M. Martelli A. Riquier S. Guittet E.

However, reduced holo-mNT, which is inactive as an Fe-S transfer protein, is poorly characterized. We, therefore, combined resonance Raman, Mössbauer, and NMR spectroscopies in an attempt to distinguish the [2Fe-2S] cluster structure/environment and backbone conformational changes of holo-mNT upon reversible redox switch. Fig. 3A shows the Fe-S stretching region of the resonance Raman spectra of both oxidized (black curve) and dithionite-reduced holo-mNT (red curve). In aerobic conditions, major vibrational bands of the mNT spectrum were observed at 269, 284, 330, 350, 393, and 412 cm−1, which is characteristic of the oxidized [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster containing mNT (25.Tirrell T.F.

Upon the addition of excess dithionite under anaerobic conditions, these markers nearly completely disappeared, whereas a strong band at 321 cm−1 appeared with additional bands at 281, 303, 372, and 397 cm−1.

HA was localized and quantified using HA binding proteins in various tissues of Hyal1–/– and Hyal2–/– mice (knockout mice) as well as control mice. HA MW was determined using gel filtration chromatography. HA endocytosis in liver nonparenchymal cells (NPCs) was quantified in vivo. Both Hyal1 and Hyal2 knockout mice showed HA accumulation in peripheral tissues without changes in HA MW distribution. HYAL2 deficiency induced buildup of very high MW (>;3.106 Da) HA in lymph and serum with severe lymph node distortion. The lack of HYAL2 also impaired high MW HA endocytosis by liver NPCs. HYAL1 deficiency led to a moderate increase in serum HA concentration without changes in HA MW distribution and to HA overload of liver NPCs. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice served as controls. In HA injection experiments, saline-injected mice served as additional controls. We conclude that: 1) HYAL1 and HYAL2 are both needed for tissue HA catabolism; 2) HYAL2 is required for high MW HA clearance in lymph nodes and plasma and for HA endocytosis by liver NPCs; and 3) the main role of HYAL1 is HA degradation within liver NPCs.—Bourguignon, V., Flamion, B.

https://openalex.org/W2342459683,"The relationship of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) cristae structure and intracristal space (ICS) to oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) is not well understood. Mitofilin (subunit Mic60) of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) IMM complex is attached to the outer membrane (OMM) via the sorting and assembly machinery/topogenesis of mitochondrial outer membrane β-barrel proteins (SAM/TOB) complex and controls the shape of the cristae. ATP synthase dimers determine sharp cristae edges, whereas trimeric OPA1 tightens ICS outlets. Metabolism is altered during hypoxia, and we therefore studied cristae morphology in HepG2 cells adapted to 5% oxygen for 72 h. Three dimensional (3D), super-resolution biplane fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy with Eos-conjugated, ICS-located lactamase-β indicated hypoxic ICS expansion with an unchanged OMM (visualized by Eos-mitochondrial fission protein-1). 3D direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy immunocytochemistry revealed foci of clustered mitofilin (but not MICOS subunit Mic19) in contrast to its even normoxic distribution. Mitofilin mRNA and protein decreased by ∼20%. ATP synthase dimers vs monomers and state-3/state-4 respiration ratios were lower during hypoxia. Electron microscopy confirmed ICS expansion (maximum in glycolytic cells), which was absent in reduced or OMM-detached cristae of OPA1- and mitofilin-silenced cells, respectively. Hypoxic adaptation is reported as rounding sharp cristae edges and expanding cristae width (ICS) by partial mitofilin/Mic60 down-regulation. Mitofilin-depleted MICOS detaches from SAM while remaining MICOS with mitofilin redistributes toward higher interdistances. This phenomenon causes partial oxphos dormancy in glycolytic cells via disruption of ATP synthase dimers.-Plecitá-Hlavatá, L., Engstová, H., Alán, L., Špaček, T., Dlasková, A., Smolková, K., Špačková, J., Tauber, J., Strádalová, V., Malínský, J., Lessard, M., Bewersdorf, J., Ježek, P.

We analyzed milk collected at 2 (n = 258) or 6 (n = 104), and 24 weeks (n = 362) from HIV-infected Malawian mothers within the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals and Nutrition (BAN) study, randomly assigned at delivery to lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) or a control group, to investigate each vitamer’s contribution to total milk vitamin content and the effects of supplementation on the different thiamin and riboflavin vitamers at early and later stages of lactation, and obtain insight into the transport and distribution of these vitamers in human milk. Thiamin vitamers were derivatized into thiochrome-esters and analyzed by high-performance liquid-chromatography-fluorescence-detection (HPLC-FLD). Riboflavin and FAD were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid-chromatography-tandem-mass-spectrometry (ULPC-MS/MS). Thiamin-pyrophosphate (TPP), identified here for the first time in breast milk, contributed 1.9–4.5% to total thiamin. Free thiamin increased significantly from 2/6 to 24 weeks regardless of treatment indicating an active transport of this vitamer in milk. LNS significantly increased TMP and free thiamin only at 2 weeks compared to the control: median 170 versus 151μg/L (TMP), 13.3 versus 10.5μg/L (free thiamin, p<0.05 for both, suggesting an up-regulated active mechanism for TMP and free thiamin accumulation at early stages of lactation. Free riboflavin was consistently and significantly increased with LNS (range: 14.8–19.6μg/L (LNS) versus 5.0–7.4μg/L (control), p<0.001), shifting FAD:riboflavin relative amounts from 92–94:6–8% to 85:15%, indicating a preferred secretion of the free form into breast milk. The continuous presence of FAD in breast milk suggests an active transport and secretion system for this vitamer or possibly formation of this co-enymatic form in the mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W2278301546,"Objective Recognising overweight and obesity is critical to prompting action, and consequently preventing and treating obesity. The present study examined the association between parental perceptions of child weight status and child’s diet. Methods Participants were members of the Gateshead Millennium Study. Parental perception of their child’s weight status was assessed using a questionnaire and compared against International Obesity Task Force cut-offs for childhood overweight and obesity when the children were aged 6–8 years old. Diet was assessed at age 6-8years old using the FAST (Food Assessment in Schools Tool) food diary method. The association between parental perception and dietary patterns as defined by Principal Components Analysis, was assessed using multivariate regression after adjustment for child’s gender, child’s weight status, maternal body mass index (BMI), maternal education and deprivation status. Results Of the 361 parents who provided complete data on confounders and on their perception of their child’s weight status, 63 (17%) parents perceived their child as being of ‘normal’ weight or ‘overweight’ when they were actually ‘overweight’ or ‘obese’, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, parents who misperceived their child’s weight had children with a lower ‘healthy’ dietary pattern score compared to children whose parents correctly perceived their weight (β = -0.88; 95% CI: -1.7, -0.1; P-value = 0.028). This association was found despite higher consumption of reduced sugar carbonated drinks amongst children whose parents incorrectly perceived their weight status compared to children whose parents perceived their weight correctly (52.4% vs. 33.6%; P-value = 0.005). Conclusions In conclusion, children whose parents did not correctly perceive their weight status scored lower on the ‘healthy’ dietary pattern. Further research is required to define parents’ diets based on their perception status and to examine if a child’s or parent’s diet mediates the association between parental perception and child weight."

Biopsy samples were taken from patients with COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage I to II) before and after treatment with fluticasone propionate (FP)/salmeterol (SM) (50/500, 4 wk). Gene expression was measured by microarray and was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The effect of FP on IgG expression and B-cell proliferation in the presence of oxidative stress was also studied. FP/SM significantly increased the expression of 180 genes while repressing 343 genes. The top 5 down-regulated genes were associated with immunoglobulin production, whereas the immunomodulatory FK506 binding protein (FK506BP) was up-regulated. Genes including IL6, IL8, and TBET-encoding TBX21 were unaffected. FP reduced IgG protein and mRNA expression and proliferation of human B cells through the dephosphorylation of ERK-1/2 via increased DUSP1 (dual-specificity protein phosphatase 1) expression. Consistent with in vivo data, oxidative stress did not prevent FP-induced suppression of IgG expression in human B cells in vitro Changes in expression were validated by RT-qPCR and by gene set enrichment analysis in distinct COPD cohorts. FP may reduce the adaptive immune response in COPD and may be more effective in patients with an increased B-cell/antibody response indicated by high autoantibody titers.-Lee, J., Machin, M., Russell, K.

https://openalex.org/W2282363461,"The strong negative correlation between grain protein concentration (GPC) and grain yield (GY) in bread wheat complicates the simultaneous improvement of these traits. However, earlier studies have concluded that the deviation from this relationship (grain protein deviation or GPD) has strong genetic basis. Genotypes with positive GPD have an increased ability to uptake nitrogen (N) during the post-flowering period independently of the amount of N taken up before flowering, suggesting that genetic variability for N satiety could enable the breakage of the negative relationship. This study is based on two genotypes markedly contrasted for GPD grown under semi-hydroponic conditions differentiated for nitrate availability both before and after flowering. This allows exploration of the genetic determinants of post-flowering N uptake (PANU) by combining whole plant sampling and targeted gene expression approaches. The results highlights the correlation (r² = 0.81) with GPC of PANU occurring early during grain development (flowering–flowering + 250 degree-days) independently of GY. Early PANU was in turn correlated (r² = 0.80) to the stem-biomass increment after flowering through its effect on N sink activity. Differences in early PANU between genotypes, despite comparable N statuses at flowering, suggest that genetic differences in N satiety could be involved in the establishment of the GPC. Through its strong negative correlation with genes implied in N assimilation, root nitrate concentration appears to be a good marker for evaluating instantaneous plant N demand, and may provide valuable information on the genotypic N satiety level. This trait may help breeders to identify genotypes having high GPC independently of their GY."
https://openalex.org/W2317532676,"Activation of the tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK) upon cell stimulation by the extracellular matrix initiates integrin outside-in signaling. FAK is directly recruited to active integrins, which enhances its kinase activity and triggers downstream signaling like activation of PI3K. We recently described that Gα-interacting, vesicle-associated protein (GIV), a protein up-regulated in metastatic cancers, is also required for outside-in integrin signaling. More specifically, we found that GIV is a non-receptor guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates trimeric G proteins in response to integrin stimulation to enhance PI3K signaling and tumor cell migration. In contrast, previous reports have established that GIV is involved in phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-based signaling in response to growth factor stimulation; i.e. GIV phosphorylation at Tyr-1764 and Tyr-1798 recruits and activates PI3K. Here we show that phosphorylation of GIV at Tyr-1764/Tyr-1798 is also required to enhance PI3K-Akt signaling and tumor cell migration in response to integrin stimulation, indicating that GIV functions in Tyr(P)-dependent integrin signaling. Unexpectedly, we found that activation of FAK, an upstream component of the integrin Tyr(P) signaling cascade, was diminished in GIV-depleted cells, suggesting that GIV is required to establish a positive feedback loop that enhances integrin-FAK signaling. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that this feedback activation of FAK depends on both guanine nucleotide exchange factor and Tyr(P) GIV signaling as well as on their convergence point, PI3K. Taken together, our results provide novel mechanistic insights into how GIV promotes proinvasive cancer cell behavior by working as a signal-amplifying platform at the crossroads of trimeric G protein and Tyr(P) signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2344528832,"The degree of fatty acid unsaturation in membrane phospholipids affects many membrane-associated functions and can be influenced by dietary consumption of fatty acids such as saturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Cells must adapt to changes in composition of membrane fatty acids by regulating lipid-metabolizing enzymes. In this study, we investigated how cells respond to loading with excess PUFAs, such as arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. A lipidomics analysis revealed that dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) was increased after the production of PUFA-containing phospholipids in cells loaded with PUFAs. An RNA interference screen of lipid-metabolizing enzymes revealed that lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) was involved in the DPPC production. Moreover, LPCAT1 knockdown markedly enhanced the cytotoxicity induced by excess PUFAs. PUFA-induced cytotoxicity was dependent on caspase and unfolded protein response (UPR) sensor proteins inositol requiring 1α and protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, suggesting that excess PUFAs trigger UPR-mediated apoptosis. In murine retina, in which PUFAs are highly enriched, DPPC was produced along with increase of PUFA-containing phospholipids. In LPCAT1 knockout mice, DPPC level was reduced and UPR was activated in the retina. Our results provide insight into understanding of the retinal degeneration seen in rd11 mice that lack LPCAT1.-Akagi, S., Kono, N., Ariyama, H., Shindou, H., Shimizu, T., Arai, H.

Deficiency in telomere maintenance mechanisms leads to the development of premature aging diseases, such as dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anemia. Mutations in the unique ""insertion in fingers domain"" (IFD) in the human telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit (hTERT) have previously been identified and shown to be associated with dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anemia. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms impacted by these IFD mutations. We performed comparative functional analyses of disease-associated IFD variants at the molecular and cellular levels. We report that hTERT-P721R- and hTERT-R811C-expressing cells exhibited growth defects likely due to impaired TPP1-mediated recruitment of these variant enzymes to telomeres. We showed that activity and processivity of hTERT-T726M failed to be stimulated by TPP1-POT1 overexpression and that dGTP usage by this variant was less efficient compared with the wild-type enzyme. hTERT-P785L-expressing cells did not show growth defects, and this variant likely confers cell survival through increased DNA synthesis and robust activity stimulation by TPP1-POT1. Altogether, our data suggest that multiple mechanisms contribute to cell growth defects conferred by the IFD variants."

We have constructed a comprehensive map of the molecules reported to be implicated in obesity. A deep curation strategy was complemented by a novel semi-automated text mining system in order to screen 1,000 full-length research articles and over 90,000 abstracts that are relevant to obesity. We obtain a scale free network of 804 nodes and 971 edges, composed of 510 proteins, 115 genes, 62 complexes, 23 RNA molecules, 83 simple molecules, 3 phenotype and 3 drugs in “bow-tie” architecture. We classify this network into 5 modules and identify new links between the recently discovered fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene with well studied examples such as insulin and leptin. We further built an automated docking pipeline to dock orlistat as well as other drugs against the 24,000 proteins in the human structural proteome to explain the therapeutics and side effects at a network level. Based upon our experiments, we propose that therapeutic effect comes through the binding of one drug with several molecules in target network, and the binding propensity is both statistically significant and different in comparison with any other part of human structural proteome."

In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been confirmed to be regulated by p53 in several cancer types. However, it is still unclear how miRNAs orchestrate their regulation and function in p53 network after p53 activation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we used small RNA sequencing and systematic bioinformatic analysis to characterize the regulatory networks of differentially expressed miRNAs after the p53 activation in HepG2. Here, 33 miRNAs significantly regulated by p53 (12 up-regulated and 21 down-regulated) were detected between the doxorubicin-treated and untreated HepG2 cells in two biological replicates for small RNA sequencing and 8 miRNAs have been reported previously to be associated with HCC. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that 87.9% (29 out of 33) and 90.9% (30 out of 33) p53-regulated miRNAs were involved in p53-related biological processes and pathways with significantly low p-value, respectively. Remarkably, 18 out of 33 p53-regulated miRNAs were identified to contain p53 binding sites around their transcription start sites (TSSs). Finally, comprehensive p53-miRNA regulatory networks were constructed and analyzed. These observations provide a new insight into p53-miRNA co-regulatory network in the context of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2282101465,"At old age, humans generally have declining muscle mass and increased fat deposition, which can increase the risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases. While regular physical activity postpones these age-related derangements, this is not always possible in the elderly because of disabilities or risk of injury. Whole-body vibration (WBV) training may be considered as an alternative to physical activity particularly in the frail population. To explore this possibility, we characterized whole-body and organ-specific metabolic processes in 6-month and 25-month old mice, over a period of 14 weeks of WBV versus sham training. WBV training tended to increase blood glucose turnover rates and stimulated hepatic glycogen utilization during fasting irrespective of age. WBV was effective in reducing white fat mass and hepatic triglyceride content only in old but not in young mice and these reductions were related to upregulation of hepatic mitochondrial uncoupling of metabolism (assessed by high-resolution respirometry) and increased expression of uncoupling protein 2. Because these changes occurred independent of changes in food intake and whole-body metabolic rate (assessed by indirect calorimetry), the liver-specific effects of WBV may be a primary mechanism to improve metabolic health during aging, rather than that it is a consequence of alterations in energy balance."
https://openalex.org/W2285260112,"The development of the mammalian skull is a complex process that requires multiple tissue interactions and a balance of growth and differentiation. Disrupting this balance can lead to changes in the shape and size of skull bones, which can have serious clinical implications. For example, insufficient ossification of the bony elements leads to enlarged anterior fontanelles and reduced mechanical protection of the brain. In this report, we find that loss of Gsk3β leads to a fully penetrant reduction of frontal bone size and subsequent enlarged frontal fontanelle. In the absence of Gsk3β the frontal bone primordium undergoes increased cell death and reduced proliferation with a concomitant increase in Fgfr2-IIIc and Twist1 expression. This leads to a smaller condensation and premature differentiation. This phenotype appears to be Wnt-independent and is not rescued by decreasing the genetic dose of β-catenin/Ctnnb1. Taken together, our work defines a novel role for Gsk3β in skull development."

Understanding the impact of HSV-2 on the mucosal microenvironment may help to identify determinants of susceptibility to HIV. Vaginal HSV-2 infection increases the frequency of cells highly susceptible to HIV in the vaginal tissue of women and macaques and this correlates with increased susceptibility to vaginal SHIV infection in macaques. However, the effect of rectal HSV-2 infection on HIV acquisition remains understudied. We developed a model of rectal HSV-2 infection in macaques in combination with rectal SIVmac239Δnef (SIVΔnef) vaccination and our results suggest that rectal HSV-2 infection may increase the susceptibility of macaques to rectal SIVmac239 wild-type (wt) infection even in SIVΔnef-infected animals. Rectal SIVΔnef infection/vaccination protected 7 out of 7 SIVΔnef-infected macaques from SIVmac239wt rectal infection (vs 12 out of 16 SIVΔnef-negative macaques), while 1 out of 3 animals co-infected with SIVΔnef and HSV-2 acquired SIVmac239wt infection. HSV-2/SIVmac239wt co-infected animals had increased concentrations of inflammatory factors in their plasma and rectal fluids and a tendency toward higher acute SIVmac239wt plasma viral load. However, they had higher blood CD4 counts and reduced depletion of CCR5+ CD4+ T cells compared to SIVmac239wt-only infected animals. Thus, rectal HSV-2 infection generates a pro-inflammatory environment that may increase susceptibility to rectal SIV infection and may impact immunological and virological parameters during acute SIV infection. Studies with larger number of animals are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2287114519,"Heterotrimeric G proteins play an essential role in the initiation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling through specific interactions with a variety of cellular effectors. We have recently reported that GPCR activation promotes a direct interaction between Gαq and protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ), leading to the stimulation of the ERK5 pathway independent of the canonical effector PLCβ. We report herein that the activation-dependent Gαq/PKCζ complex involves the basic PB1-type II domain of PKCζ and a novel interaction module in Gαq different from the classical effector-binding site. Point mutations in this Gαq region completely abrogate ERK5 phosphorylation, indicating that Gαq/PKCζ association is required for the activation of the pathway. Indeed, PKCζ was demonstrated to directly bind ERK5 thus acting as a scaffold between Gαq and ERK5 upon GPCR activation.

CHO cells were maintained in αMEM and HeLa, COS-7, and HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The desired cell type was stimulated with carbachol at 37 °C in serum-free medium, at the specified doses and during the indicated time periods. The cells were serum-starved before ligand addition to minimize basal kinase activity. When required, cells (70–80% confluent monolayers in 60-mm dishes) were transiently transfected with the desired combinations of cDNA constructs using the Lipofectamine/Plus method (Invitrogen), following manufacturer’s instructions. Empty vector was added to keep the total amount of DNA per dish constant. Assays were performed 24 h after transfection. Transient expression of the desired proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of whole-cell lysates using specific antisera. Venus-YFP expression constructs for the protein complementation assay (PCA) were obtained by sub-cloning Gnaq (mouse, accession number NM_002072) and Prkcz (rat, accession number NM_022507.1) into the 5′- and 3′-ends of the Venus YFP PCA fragments, referred to here as N-terminal fragment (1–158 aa; F[1]) and the C-terminal fragment (159–239 aa; F[2]), respectively, as previously described (10Remy I. Michnick S.W. Mapping biochemical networks with protein-fragment complementation assays.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 411-426PubMed Google Scholar). PKCζ binding-deficient mutants, Gαq binding-deficient mutants and Gαq constitutively active mutants were prepared using the QuickChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following manufacturer’s instructions. 24–48 h after transfection, cells were scraped and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors), and clarified by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitation was performed with agarose-conjugated anti-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F-7) or, alternatively, with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and anti-Gαq (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C19) followed by re-incubation with protein G-Sepharose. All blots were developed using the chemoluminescence method and quantified by laser-scanner densitometry. To analyze MEK5/PKCζ binding, lysates from cells expressing GST-MEK5 (or GST alone as a negative control) were subjected to GST pull-down assays with glutathione-Sepharose 4B as previously reported (8García-Hoz C. Sánchez-Fernández G. Díaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mayor F. Ribas C. Gα(q) acts as an adaptor protein in protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ)-mediated ERK5 activation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR).J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13480-13489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the analysis of PKCζ-ERK5 binding, purified GST-ERK5 or GST were incubated overnight at 100 nm with 20 nm His-PKCζ at 4 °C in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.01% Lubrol, 0.6 mm, EDTA, and 70 mm NaCl) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture. Fusion proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and washed 8–10 times with the same buffer. To explore whether PKCζ binds to Gαq in a GTP-dependent manner, 20 nm of purified His6-PKCζ was incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Probond) for 2 h at 4 °C in His-Binding Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). The mixture was then incubated with 50 nm of purified Gαq or Gαq loaded with GTPγS overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer. Recombinant protein complexes were washed 8–10 times with His-Binding Buffer supplemented with 30 mm imidazole. Recombinant Gαq was purified as described (11Chan P Gabay M Wright FA Kan W Oner SS Lanier SM Smrcka AV Blumer JB Tall GG Purification of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits by GST-Ric-8 association: primary characterization of purified G α(olf).J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2625-2635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Gαq-GDP (10 μm) was incubated in a 1 ml reaction with 20 μm purified Ric-8A (12Tall GG Krumins AM Gilman AG Mammalian Ric-8A (Synembryn) is a heterotrimeric Gα protein guanine nucleotide exchange factor.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8356-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and 100 μm GTPγS in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Genapol C-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT for 1 h at 25 °C. The reaction was gel filtered over Superdex 75/200 columns arranged in series to separate Gαq from Ric-8A. The monomeric Gαq-GTPγS fractions were pooled, concentrated in a 10,000 MWCO Amicon Ultracentrifugal device, and stored as 20-μm aliquots at −80 °C. Lysates were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis as previously described (8García-Hoz C. Sánchez-Fernández G. Díaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mayor F. Ribas C. Gα(q) acts as an adaptor protein in protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ)-mediated ERK5 activation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR).J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13480-13489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The activation state of ERK5 was measured by laser-scanner densitometry and expressed as the amount of phospho-ERK5 normalized to the amount of the total ERK5 protein. In CHO and HeLa cell lines HA-tagged ERK5 was transfected and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA agarose beads (Santa Cruz). Immunoprecipitates were washed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate plus a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors) at 4 °C. Protein-protein complexes can be recapitulated in living cells, by fusing protein pairs to complementary N- and C-terminal fragments of a reporter (enzyme or fluorescent protein). If the proteins interact the fragments of the reporter protein will be brought into proximity where they can spontaneously fold together and reconstitute enzymatic activity or fluorescence (10Remy I. Michnick S.W. Mapping biochemical networks with protein-fragment complementation assays.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 411-426PubMed Google Scholar). Venus YFP-based PCA: Cells were co-transfected with the Venus YFP PCA expression vectors coding for prey-F[1] and/or bait-F[2]. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were subjected to fluorometric analysis and fluorescence microscopy. For the fluorometric analysis, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in PBS, transferred to 96-well black microtiter plates (Dynex; VWR Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario), and measured in a fluorometer (integration time 10 s, excitation wavelength 470 nm, emission wavelength 528 nm) (Spectra MAX GEMINI XS; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Background fluorescence was subtracted from fluorometric values of all of the samples. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U inverted microscope with 40× objective and YFP filter cube (41028, Chroma Technologies). Images were captured with a CoolSnap CCD camera (Photometrics) using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). When comparing different PCA pairs, identical microscopy settings were utilized, and the expression of each construct was assessed by Western blot to ensure that the differences observed in the fluorescence images was a due to a lack of interaction and not to insufficient expression of one of the reporters. The xCELLigence system RTCA SP instrument (Roche Applied Science) monitors changes in the cell index (a measure of cell attachment to the plate), which has been shown to effectively correlate to proliferation, adhesion, and viability changes (13Limame R. Wouters A. Pauwels B. Fransen E. Peeters M. Lardon F. De Wever O. Pauwels P. Comparative analysis of dynamic cell viability, migration and invasion assessments by novel real-time technology and classic endpoint assays.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7e46536Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Ke N. Wang X. Xu X. Abassi Y.A. The xCELLigence system for real-time and label-free monitoring of cell viability.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 740: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). To assess long-term viability cells were seeded in 96-well gold electrode sensor plate (E-plates) pre-coated with fibronectin (10 μm) and monitored every 15 min for at least 3 days in minimal medium (3% FBS) until an irreversible decrease (inflection point) in the cell index was recorded. Cell death was expressed as the time between the start of the experiment and the inflection point. The first 16 h after the cells were plated were excluded from each analysis as they correspond to the cell adhesion phase. In no case was cell death due to excessive confluence as confirmed by plate inspection with a microscope. Cells were transiently transfected with the desired combinations of cDNA constructs and with GFP for the selection of the transfected population. Cells were cultured in 0.1% FBS DMEM for 48 h. If required, cells were treated with the PLCβ inhibitor U73122 (10 μm) or with the ERK5 inhibitor XMD8–92 (1 μm) 24 h before staining. Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in Staining Buffer (PBS 1×, 1% BSA, 0.01% NaN3, 1% FBS) with propidium iodide (PI) 1 μg/ml. Analysis was carried out in a BD FacsCalibur flow cytometer (BD-Bioscience) and GFP-positive and propidium iodide-positive cells were quantified using CellQuest Software (BD-Bioscience) and analyzed with the FlowJo Software. Within the GFP-positive population the percentage of PI-positive cells was calculated as a measure of cell death due to heterologous expression. To quantitatively measure apoptosis, the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection kit I (BD Bioscience) was utilized. Transfection and serum starving were carried out as in PI assays, after which cells were re-suspended in Annexin V-binding buffer (0.1 m Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 1.4 m NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2) at a final concentration of 1 × 105 cells. Samples were incubated with 2.5 μl of PE Annexin V and 5 μl of 7-AAD for 15 min at RT in the dark. Subsequently, 400 μl of binding buffer was added, and samples were analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h on a BD FacsCalibur flow cytometer (BD-Bioscience). To determine the apoptotic stage of the different GFP-positive cell populations, 7-AAD- and Annexin V-positive cells were determined with the CellQuest Software (BD-Bioscience) and analyzed with the FlowJo Software. Cells treated with staurosporine (2.5 μm, 2 h) or ultraviolet irradiation (2 h), were considered the apoptotic (annexin V-positive) and necrotic (7-AAD-positive) controls, respectively. Within the GFP-positive population the percentage of annexin-positive cells was calculated as a measure of apoptotic cell death due to heterologous expression. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Student's t test, as indicated in the figure legends. The activation of the ERK5 pathway by Gq-GPCRs appears to correlate with the formation of a transient complex between Gαq and PKCζ (8García-Hoz C. Sánchez-Fernández G. Díaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mayor F. Ribas C. Gα(q) acts as an adaptor protein in protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ)-mediated ERK5 activation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR).J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13480-13489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such interaction was suggested to be direct since these purified proteins are able to associate in vitro. A pull-down assay performed with purified proteins indicated that PKCζ preferentially binds the GTPγS-loaded form of Gαq (Fig. 1A). Further, the formation of a Gαq/PKCζ complex in living cells was assessed through a Protein-fragment Complementation Assay (PCA) (Fig. 1B). A clear association between PKCζ and Gαq was observed, as compared with a known high-affinity interaction (GCN4 leucine “zipper” dimerization) (Fig. 1C). The Gαq/PKCζ complex displays high specificity, since no association was detected between Gαq and another member of the PKC family, PKCβ, nor between PKCζ and another member of the Gα family (Gαi1) (Fig. 1C). PB1 domains are known protein-protein interaction domains, and this module alone accounts for the majority of the reported interactions of PKCζ (15Sumimoto H. Kamakura S. Ito T. Structure and function of the PB1 domain, a protein interaction module conserved in animals, fungi, amoebas, and plants.Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007: re6Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PKCζ-PB1 domain overexpression was shown to interfere with the formation of Gq/PKCζ complexes in cells, as assessed through co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 2A). Indeed, the PKCζ-PB1 domain alone is able to co-immunoprecipitate with Gαq (Fig. 2B), thus suggesting that PKCζ might interact with Gαq through this module. The PB1 domain of PKCζ is composed of a PB1-type I (acidic) and a PB1-type II (basic) domain (16Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Albert A. Campuzano S. Cell signaling and function organized by PB1 domain interactions.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 631-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Since the PB1-type II domain of PKCζ has previously been involved in ERK5 activation by the EGF receptor and in MEK5 binding (17Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. MEK5, a new target of the atypical protein kinase C isoforms in mitogenic signaling.Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a strategy was designed to mutate key amino acids in this region (Fig. 2C). In particular, lysine 19 (K19) seems to be an invariably crucial residue in all PB1-PB1 interactions in combination with other predominantly basic residues located nearby within the three-dimensional structure (18Hirano Y. Yoshinaga S. Takeya R. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M. Kohjima M. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. Structure of a cell polarity regulator, a complex between atypical PKC and Par6 PB1 domains.J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31883-31890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Remarkably, different point mutations in the PB1-type II region and specially that in Lys-19 decreased the interaction with Gαq in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2D). This residue was also found to be essential for PKCζ-MEK5 binding (Fig. 2E), as predicted by other PB1-PB1 structures (19Hirano Y. Yoshinaga S. Ogura K. Yokochi M. Noda Y. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. Solution structure of atypical protein kinase C PB1 domain and its mode of interaction with ZIP/p62 and MEK5.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31883-31890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another mutation within this domain (PKCζ-H21A) enhanced the ability of PKCζ to associate with Gαq (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these data indicate that the PB1 domain type II of PKCζ is crucial for binding Gαq. Since members of the Gαi family cannot interact with PKCζ (Fig. 1C and Ref. 8García-Hoz C. Sánchez-Fernández G. Díaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mayor F. Ribas C. Gα(q) acts as an adaptor protein in protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ)-mediated ERK5 activation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR).J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13480-13489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we utilized two different chimeras in which the C terminus (aa 222–353) of either Gαq or Gαi1 had been substituted by that of Gαi1 and Gαq, respectively (20Medina R. Grishina G. Meloni E.G. Muth T.R. Berlot C.H. Localization of the effector-specifying regions of Gi2α and Gqα.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), to delineate relevant regions for PKCζ association. A Gαq chimera with the C terminus of Gαi1 was unable to interact with PKCζ when expressed in cells (Fig. 3A), thus suggesting that the interaction determinants are predominantly located in the C terminus of Gαq. This C-terminal stretch includes the classical effector-binding region (21Sánchez-Fernández G. Cabezudo S. García-Hoz C. Benincá C. Aragay A.M. Mayor Jr., F. Ribas C. Gαq signalling: the new and the old.Cell Signal. 2014; 26: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To assess whether this region is responsible for binding PKCζ, we used different Gαq mutants unable to interact with other effectors such as PLCβ and p63RhoGEF (Gαq-R256A/T257A, (22Fan G. Ballou L.M.

Kawano T. Shankaranarayanan A. Kozasa T. Tesmer J.J.G. Snapshot of activated G proteins at the membrane: the Gαq-GRK2-Gβγ complex.Science. 2005; 310: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar)). Surprisingly, neither mutant affected PKCζ binding but on the contrary all co-immunoprecipitated with the kinase to a greater extent than wild-type Gαq (Fig. 3, B and C). These data suggest that the absence of competitors on the surface of Gαq favors the interaction with PKCζ. This may indicate that PKCζ is interacting with other region close to the classical effector site. We noted that the adjacent β4-α3 loop in Gαq displays a relatively high sequence similarity with the PB1-type I domain of MEK5, a module known to interact with the PB1-type II domain of PKCζ (Fig. 4A). A double mutation (E234/E245-AA) in the homologous residues of Gαq in this potential interaction module significantly impaired its association with PKCζ (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, these amino acids were found to be homologous to highly conserved residues in several PB1-type I domain-harboring proteins as part of two major functional clusters (A1 and A2) (Fig. 4C) (18Hirano Y. Yoshinaga S. Takeya R. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M. Kohjima M. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. Structure of a cell polarity regulator, a complex between atypical PKC and Par6 PB1 domains.J. Biol.

Overall, these data indicate that a region of Gαq, distinct from the classical effector-binding site, is involved in the interaction with PKCζ.FIGURE 4Gαq interacts with PKCζ through a novel effector-binding region.

We have developed a novel docking strategy guided by paramagnetic NMR that positions a triple-helical collagen V mimic (synthesized with nitroxide spin labels) in the active site of the catalytic domain of matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12 or macrophage metalloelastase) primed for catalysis. The collagenolytically productive complex forms by utilizing seven distinct subsites that traverse the entire length of the active site. These subsites bury ∼1,080 Å2 of surface area, over half of which is contributed by the trailing strand of the synthetic collagen V mimic, which also appears to ligate the catalytic zinc through the glycine carbonyl oxygen of its scissile G∼VV triplet. Notably, the middle strand also occupies the full length of the active site where it contributes extensive interfacial contacts with five subsites. This work identifies, for the first time, the productive and specific interactions of a collagen triple helix with an MMP catalytic site. The results uniquely demonstrate that the active site of the MMPs is wide enough to accommodate two strands from collagen triple helices. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancements also reveal an extensive array of encounter complexes that form over a large part of the catalytic domain. These transient complexes could possibly facilitate the formation of collagenolytically active complexes via directional Brownian tumbling.

Collagen fibrils are bundles of staggered triple helices. Each triple helix comprises three extended strands twisted into a right-handed superhelix with hydrogen bonding between chains (9Shoulders M.D. Raines R.T. Collagen structure and stability.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 929-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). Each collagen chain is a long series of GXY triplets in which the glycine is in the interior, X is often proline, and Y is often a stabilizing 4-hydroxyproline (Hyp). Because each chain is offset by one residue, the chains have been named leading, middle, and trailing (10Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C.

Lack of Pro and Hyp in four GXY triplets on the C-terminal side of the MMP scissile bond in interstitial collagens (types I, II, and III) was proposed to loosen the triple helix (1Fields G.B. A model for interstitial collagen catabolism by mammalian collagenases.J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 153: 585-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this was later observed as 10-fold symmetry (11Kramer R.Z.

Protease substrates are labeled by increasing distance from the scissile peptide bond with a prime indicating the C-terminal side: P4-P3-P-P1∼P1′-P2′-P3′-P4′ where ∼ denotes the scissile peptide bond. We refer to the residues on the N-terminal side of the scissile bond as “unprimed” and those on the C-terminal side as “primed.” The active site of MMPs is funnel-shaped with a wide end of unprimed subsites and a narrow end of primed subsites. The ∼13-Å diameter of the collagen triple helix appears too wide to fit the 6-Å-wide channel through the primed subsites, prompting a longstanding question of how can the triple helix fit into the narrow channel (12Overall C.M.

We observed digestion of collagens I and V by the MMP-12 catalytic domain to be very slow. Nonetheless, prior x-ray crystallographic studies demonstrated the catalytic domain of MMP-12 to be a model system appropriate for collagenolysis (26Bertini I. Calderone V. Fragai M. Luchinat C.

In turn, MMP-12 efficiently hydrolyzes a homotrimeric triple-helical peptide that mimics residues 436–450 of the α1 chain of collagen V, abbreviated α1(V)436–450 THP (27Lauer-Fields J.L. Sritharan T.

This self-assembling miniprotein was used for the docking studies described below. Collagen digestion by MMPs normally requires the catalytic domain working in tandem with the hemopexin-like domain or fibronectin-like inserts (12Overall C.M.

The MMP-12 catalytic domain and its interaction with the homotrimeric collagen V mimic provide a simplified model of triple-helical peptidase activity of collagenolytic MMPs. The interfaces between proteins can be mapped by NMR peak shifts (chemical shift perturbations) but with the complication that conformational changes can also shift peaks (29Williamson M.P.

We adopted this latter paramagnetic NMR approach to generate numerous structural restraints between the triple-helical peptide from collagen V and the MMP-12 catalytic domain despite their moderate affinity (28Bhaskaran R.

The measurement of paramagnetic NMR relaxation also presented an opportunity to look at the sparsely populated encounter complexes that have been proposed to precede the formation of catalytic complexes (37Bashir Q. Volkov A.N. Ullmann G.M. Ubbink M. Visualization of the encounter ensemble of the transient electron transfer complex of cytochrome c and cytochrome c peroxidase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Elucidation of various encounter complexes proved crucial to capturing experimentally, for the first time to our knowledge, the productive complex with the triple helix intact, two of its chains occupying portions of the catalytic channel, and the scissile Gly∼Val peptide bond positioned correctly for catalysis. The encounter complexes form along an extended serpentine surface that centers around the II-III loop (previously designated exosite 2 of elastin interactions (42Fulcher Y.G. Van Doren S.R.

This might suggest a route of guided Brownian tumbling of an MMP on collagen fibrils, which could possibly hasten diffusive search to position the catalytic cleft around the triple helix. Self-assembling, homotrimeric α1(V)436–450 THP samples were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase methodology (43Fields G.B.

The integrity and thermal stability of the triple helix of each sample were determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). Peptides were allowed to assemble for 3 days at 4 °C immediately prior to use. The E219A-inactivated catalytic domain of MMP-12, designated MMP-12 cat, was prepared as described in a buffer of 20 mm imidazole (pH 6.6), 10 mm CaCl2, and 20 μm ZnCl2 (31Bhaskaran R. Palmier M.O.

NMR was performed on a Bruker Avance III 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Sample temperatures were 25 °C with TOAC substitution at P5 of the unprimed substrate and 8 °C with TOAC substitution at P8′ in the primed substrate. These temperatures were chosen to keep the triple helix mostly assembled in each. In the nomenclature of protease substrates, P5 is five residues in the N-terminal direction from the scissile Gly∼Val peptide bond, whereas P8′ is eight residues in the C-terminal direction from the scissile bond. Spectra were processed using Bruker TopSpin and analyzed using CcpNmr Analysis (44Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D.

https://openalex.org/W2276117259,"A key role of boron in plants is to cross-link the cell wall pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan-II (RG-II) through borate diester linkages. Phenylboronic acid (PBA) can form the same reversible ester bonds but cannot cross-link two molecules, so can be used as an antagonist to study the function of boron. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of PBA on apple (Malus domestica) pollen tube growth and the underlying regulatory mechanism. We observed that PBA caused an inhibition of pollen germination, tube growth and led to pollen tube morphological abnormalities. Fluorescent labeling, coupled with a scanning ion-selective electrode technique, revealed that PBA induced an increase in extracellular Ca2+ influx, thereby elevating the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]c and disrupting the [Ca2+]c gradient, which is critical for pollen tube growth. Moreover the organization of actin filaments was severely perturbed by the PBA treatment. Immunolocalization studies and fluorescent labeling, together with Fourier-transform infrared analysis (FTIR) suggested that PBA caused an increase in the abundance of callose, de-esterified pectins and arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) at the tip. However, it had no effect on the deposition of the wall polymers cellulose. These effects are similar to those of boron deficiency in roots and other organs, indicating that PBA can induce boron deficiency symptoms. The results provide new insights into the roles of boron in pollen tube development, which likely include regulating [Ca2+]c and the formation of the actin cytoskeleton, in addition to the synthesis and assembly of cell wall components."
https://openalex.org/W2276863238,"Introduction Surface electromyography (sEMG) is the measurement of the electrical activity of the skeletal muscle tissue detected at the skin’s surface. Typically, a bipolar electrode configuration is used. Most muscles have pennate and/or curved fibres, meaning it is not always feasible to align the bipolar electrodes along the fibres direction. Hence, there is a need to explore how different electrode designs can affect sEMG measurements. Method A three layer finite element (skin, fat, muscle) muscle model was used to explore different electrode designs. The implemented model used as source signal an experimentally recorded intramuscular EMG taken from the biceps brachii muscle of one healthy male. A wavelet based intensity analysis of the simulated sEMG signal was performed to analyze the power of the signal in the time and frequency domain. Results The model showed muscle tissue causing a bandwidth reduction (to 20-92- Hz). The inter-electrode distance (IED) and the electrode orientation relative to the fibres affected the total power but not the frequency filtering response. The effect of significant misalignment between the electrodes and the fibres (60°- 90°) could be reduced by increasing the IED (25–30 mm), which attenuates signal cancellation. When modelling pennated fibres, the muscle tissue started to act as a low pass filter. The effect of different IED seems to be enhanced in the pennated model, while the filtering response is changed considerably only when the electrodes are close to the signal termination within the model. For pennation angle greater than 20°, more than 50% of the source signal was attenuated, which can be compensated by increasing the IED to 25 mm. Conclusion Differences in tissue filtering properties, shown in our model, indicates that different electrode designs should be considered for muscle with different geometric properties (i.e. pennated muscles)."

Improving the accuracy of diagnosing this disease would aid in reducing the mortality of associated infections. In this study, we developed a stable and reproducible murine pulmonary model that mimics human penicilliosis marneffei using a nebulizer to deliver Talaromyces marneffei (SUMS0152) conidia to the lungs of BALB/c nude mice housed in exposure chamber. Using this model, we further revealed that nested PCR was sensitive and specific for detecting Talaromyces marneffei in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and fresh tissues. This inhalation model may provide a more representative analysis tool for studying the development of penicilliosis marneffei, in addition to revealing that nested PCR has a predictive value in reflecting pulmonary infection."
https://openalex.org/W2283456880,"Rhoptry-associated membrane antigen (RAMA) is an abundant glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that is embedded within the lipid bilayer and is implicated in parasite invasion. Antibody responses against rhoptry proteins are produced by individuals living in a malaria-endemic area, suggesting the immunogenicity of Plasmodium vivax RAMA (PvRAMA) for induction of immune responses during P. vivax infection. To determine whether PvRAMA contributes to the acquisition of immunity to malaria and could be a rational candidate for a vaccine, the presence of memory T cells and the stability of the antibody response against PvRAMA were evaluated in P. vivax-exposed individuals. The immunogenicity of PvRAMA for the induction of T cell responses was evaluated by in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). High levels of interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-10 cytokines were detected in the culture supernatant of PBMCs, and the CD4+ T cells predominantly produced IL-10 cytokine. The levels of total anti-PvRAMA immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody were significantly elevated, and these antibodies persisted over the 12 months of the study. Interestingly, IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 were the major antibody subtypes in the response to PvRAMA. The frequency of IgG3 in specific to PvRAMA antigen maintained over 12 months. These data could explain the immunogenicity of PvRAMA antigen in induction of both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity in natural P. vivax infection, in which IFN-γ helps antibody class switching toward the IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 isotypes and IL-10 supports PvRAMA-specific antibody production."

We found a general ordering of the effects of the ZFPs and sRNAs on induction fold that mostly held true when combining these parts. We then attempted to construct a ring oscillator using our new inverters. Our chosen parts performed insufficiently to create oscillations, but we include future directions for improvement upon our work presented here."
https://openalex.org/W2284810352,"Randomized response is a research method to get accurate answers to sensitive questions in structured sample survey. Simple random sampling is widely used in surveys of sensitive questions but hard to apply on large targeted populations. On the other side, more sophisticated sampling regimes and corresponding formulas are seldom employed to sensitive question surveys. In this work, we developed a series of formulas for parameter estimation in cluster sampling and stratified cluster sampling under two kinds of randomized response models by using classic sampling theories and total probability formulas. The performances of the sampling methods and formulas in the survey of premarital sex and cheating on exams at Soochow University were also provided. The reliability of the survey methods and formulas for sensitive question survey was found to be high."
https://openalex.org/W2287603008,"Understanding of the structure of the γ-secretase complex consisting of presenilin (PS), anterior pharynx-defective 1 (APH-1), nicastrin (NCT), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN-2) is of significant therapeutic interest for the design of γ-secretase modulators for Alzheimer disease. The structure of γ-secretase revealed by cryo-EM approaches suggested a substrate binding mechanism for NCT, a bilobar structure that involved rotation of the two lobes around a central pivot and opening of a region that facilitates substrate recruitment. To validate this proposal, we expressed NCT that lacks the lid entirely, or a variety of NCT variants that harbor mutations at highly conserved residues in the lid region inNCT-deficient cells, and then assessed their impact on γ-secretase assembly, activity, and stability. In addition, we assessed the impact of mutating a critical residue proposed to be a pivot around which the two lobes of NCT rotate. Our results show that neither the mutations on the lid tested here nor the entire lid deletion has any significant impact on γ-secretase assembly, activity, and stability, and that NCT with the mutation of the proposed pivot rescues γ-secretase activity inNCT-deficient cells in a manner indistinguishable from WT NCT. These findings indicate that the NCT lid is not an essential element necessary for γ-secretase assembly, activity, and stability, and that rotation of the two lobes appears not to be a prerequisite for substrate binding and γ-secretase function."
https://openalex.org/W2280235211,"Background Clinical trials have been criticized on various counts. Any attempt to improve how trials are conducted or reported requires—amongst other things—an understanding of the number, the nature and the location of those that sponsor them or collaborate on them. Here we sought to identify the nature and location of each sponsor/collaborator. Methods and Findings We examined the 'sponsor/collaborator' field for the 69,160 drug trials that were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov over a 9-year period (2005–2014). Of the 12,823 unique sponsors, 56% had sponsored only one and 27% had sponsored 2–5 trials each. Just 18% were involved with six or more trials each, and we have (arbitrarily) labeled these organizations as 'more experienced' in sponsoring/collaborating on trials. These 18% (2,266 sponsors/collaborators) were analyzed further: (a) 951 were corporate organizations and (b) 1,145 were non-corporates (including 31 individuals) with (c) 170 unclassified. Further, we identified the location of each organization in (a) and (b). Conclusions Clinical trials are an important part of a nation's research endeavors, and ultimately contribute to the health of its people. Thus, understanding the clinical trial landscape—including the number and nature of sponsors, and how active they are—is important for every country. We believe that policy makers in particular should be interested in this study to understand the current situation, and to use the numbers as a baseline for the evolving landscape, to assess the impact of their strategies in future."
https://openalex.org/W2282076466,"The transcription regulatory system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) remains incompletely understood. In this study, we have applied the eGLECLUBS algorithm to a group of related prokaryotic genomes for de novo genome-wide prediction of cis-regulatory binding sites (CRBSs) in M. tb H37Rv. The top 250 clusters from our prediction recovered 83.3% (50/60) of all known CRBSs in extracted inter-operonic sequences of this strain. We further demonstrated that the integration of our prediction results with the ChIP-Seq datasets is very effective in identifying true binding sites of TFs. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and real-time RT-PCR, we experimentally verified our prediction of CRBSs for Rv0081, an important transcription factor thought to be involved in regulation of M. tb under hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2287747387,"Little is known about management practices that can simultaneously improve soil and environmental quality and sustain crop yields. The effects of novel and traditional management practices that included a combination of tillage, crop rotation, and N fertilization on soil C and N, global warming potential (GWP), greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), and malt barley (Hordeum vulgarie L.) yield and quality were examined under non-irrigated and irrigated cropping systems from 2008 to 2011 in eastern Montana and western North Dakota, USA. In loamy soil under non-irrigated condition in eastern Montana, novel and traditional management practices were no-till malt barley-pea (Pisum sativum L.) with 80 kg N ha(-1) and conventional till malt barley-fallow with 80 kg N ha(-1), respectively. In sandy loam soil under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions in western North Dakota, novel and traditional management practices included no-till malt barley-pea with 67 (non-irrigated) to 134 kg N ha(-1) (irrigated) and conventional till malt barley with 67 (non-irrigated) to 134 kg N ha(-1) (irrigated), respectively. Compared with the traditional management practice, soil organic C (SOC) and total N (STN) at 0-120 cm were 5% greater with the novel management practice under non-irrigated condition in eastern Montana and under irrigated condition in western North Dakota, but were not different under non-irrigated condition in western North Dakota. In both places under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions, total applied N rate, residual soil NO3-N content at 0-120 cm, global warming potential (GWP), and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) were 15 to 70% lower with the novel than the traditional management practice. Malt barley yield and quality were not different between the two practices in both places. Novel management practices, such as no-till malt barley-pea with reduced N rate, can simultaneously enhance soil and environmental quality, reduce N input, and sustain crop yield compared with traditional practices in the northern Great Plains, USA."
