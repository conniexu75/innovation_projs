https://openalex.org/W3133076643,"Regulatory T (Treg) cells, although vital for immune homeostasis, also represent a major barrier to anti-cancer immunity, as the tumour microenvironment (TME) promotes the recruitment, differentiation and activity of these cells1,2. Tumour cells show deregulated metabolism, leading to a metabolite-depleted, hypoxic and acidic TME3, which places infiltrating effector T cells in competition with the tumour for metabolites and impairs their function4–6. At the same time, Treg cells maintain a strong suppression of effector T cells within the TME7,8. As previous studies suggested that Treg cells possess a distinct metabolic profile from effector T cells9–11, we hypothesized that the altered metabolic landscape of the TME and increased activity of intratumoral Treg cells are linked. Here we show that Treg cells display broad heterogeneity in their metabolism of glucose within normal and transformed tissues, and can engage an alternative metabolic pathway to maintain suppressive function and proliferation. Glucose uptake correlates with poorer suppressive function and long-term instability, and high-glucose conditions impair the function and stability of Treg cells in vitro. Treg cells instead upregulate pathways involved in the metabolism of the glycolytic by-product lactic acid. Treg cells withstand high-lactate conditions, and treatment with lactate prevents the destabilizing effects of high-glucose conditions, generating intermediates necessary for proliferation. Deletion of MCT1—a lactate transporter—in Treg cells reveals that lactate uptake is dispensable for the function of peripheral Treg cells but required intratumorally, resulting in slowed tumour growth and an increased response to immunotherapy. Thus, Treg cells are metabolically flexible: they can use ‘alternative’ metabolites in the TME to maintain their suppressive identity. Further, our results suggest that tumours avoid destruction by not only depriving effector T cells of nutrients, but also metabolically supporting regulatory populations. The tumour microenvironment is low in glucose and high in the alternative metabolite lactate, which regulatory T cells are shown here to use, maintaining their ability to suppress effector immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W3133221794,"Limiting metabolic competition in the tumour microenvironment may increase the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Owing to its crucial role in the glucose metabolism of activated T cells, CD28 signalling has been proposed as a metabolic biosensor of T cells1. By contrast, the engagement of CTLA-4 has been shown to downregulate T cell glycolysis1. Here we investigate the effect of CTLA-4 blockade on the metabolic fitness of intra-tumour T cells in relation to the glycolytic capacity of tumour cells. We found that CTLA-4 blockade promotes metabolic fitness and the infiltration of immune cells, especially in glycolysis-low tumours. Accordingly, treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies improved the therapeutic outcomes of mice bearing glycolysis-defective tumours. Notably, tumour-specific CD8+ T cell responses correlated with phenotypic and functional destabilization of tumour-infiltrating regulatory T (Treg) cells towards IFNγ- and TNF-producing cells in glycolysis-defective tumours. By mimicking the highly and poorly glycolytic tumour microenvironments in vitro, we show that the effect of CTLA-4 blockade on the destabilization of Treg cells is dependent on Treg cell glycolysis and CD28 signalling. These findings indicate that decreasing tumour competition for glucose may facilitate the therapeutic activity of CTLA-4 blockade, thus supporting its combination with inhibitors of tumour glycolysis. Moreover, these results reveal a mechanism by which anti-CTLA-4 treatment interferes with Treg cell function in the presence of glucose."
https://openalex.org/W3130615914,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to spread relentlessly, associated with a high frequency of respiratory failure and mortality. Children experience largely asymptomatic disease, with rare reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Identifying immune mechanisms that result in these disparate clinical phenotypes in children could provide critical insights into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis. Using systems serology, in this study we observed in 25 children with acute mild COVID-19 a functional phagocyte and complement-activating IgG response to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the acute responses generated in adults with mild disease. Conversely, IgA and neutrophil responses were significantly expanded in adults with severe disease. Moreover, weeks after the resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, children who develop MIS-C maintained highly inflammatory monocyte-activating SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, distinguishable from acute disease in children but with antibody levels similar to those in convalescent adults. Collectively, these data provide unique insights into the potential mechanisms of IgG and IgA that might underlie differential disease severity as well as unexpected complications in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. A study of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) shows maintenance of elevated levels of monocyte-activating pathogen-specific IgG not seen in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 who do not develop MIS-C."
https://openalex.org/W3130700305,"The spinal cord is a fascinating structure that is responsible for coordinating movement in vertebrates. Spinal motor neurons control muscle activity by transmitting signals from the spinal cord to diverse peripheral targets. In this study, we profiled 43,890 single-nucleus transcriptomes from the adult mouse spinal cord using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting to enrich for motor neuron nuclei. We identified 16 sympathetic motor neuron clusters, which are distinguishable by spatial localization and expression of neuromodulatory signaling genes. We found surprising skeletal motor neuron heterogeneity in the adult spinal cord, including transcriptional differences that correlate with electrophysiologically and spatially distinct motor pools. We also provide evidence for a novel transcriptional subpopulation of skeletal motor neuron (γ*). Collectively, these data provide a single-cell transcriptional atlas ( http://spinalcordatlas.org ) for investigating the organizing molecular logic of adult motor neuron diversity, as well as the cellular and molecular basis of motor neuron function in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3132698639,"Background The success of a government’s COVID-19 control strategy relies on public trust and broad acceptance of response measures. We investigated public perceptions of the UK government’s COVID-19 response, focusing on the relationship between trust and perceived transparency, during the first wave (April 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Methods Anonymous survey data were collected (2020-04-06 to 2020-04-22) from 9,322 respondents, aged 20+ using an online questionnaire shared primarily through Facebook. We took an embedded-mixed-methods approach to data analysis. Missing data were imputed via multiple imputation. Binomial &amp; multinomial logistic regression were used to detect associations between demographic characteristics and perceptions or opinions of the UK government’s response to COVID-19. Structural topic modelling (STM), qualitative thematic coding of sub-sets of responses were then used to perform a thematic analysis of topics that were of interest to key demographic groups. Results Most respondents (95.1%) supported government enforcement of behaviour change. While 52.1% of respondents thought the government was making good decisions, differences were apparent across demographic groups, for example respondents from Scotland had lower odds of responding positively than respondents in London. Higher educational levels saw decreasing odds of having a positive opinion of the government response and decreasing household income associated with decreasing positive opinion. Of respondents who thought the government was not making good decisions 60% believed the economy was being prioritised over people and their health. Positive views on government decision-making were associated with positive views on government transparency about the COVID-19 response. Qualitative analysis about perceptions of government transparency highlighted five key themes: (1) the justification of opacity due to the condition of crisis, (2) generalised mistrust of politics, (3) concerns about the role of scientific evidence, (4) quality of government communication and (5) questions about political decision-making processes. Conclusion Our study suggests that trust is not homogenous across communities, and that generalised mistrust, concerns about the transparent use and communication of evidence and insights into decision-making processes can affect perceptions of the government’s pandemic response. We recommend targeted community engagement, tailored to the experiences of different groups and a new focus on accountability and openness around how decisions are made in the response to the UK COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3131743810,"Oxytocin (OT) orchestrates social and emotional behaviors through modulation of neural circuits. In the central amygdala, the release of OT modulates inhibitory circuits and, thereby, suppresses fear responses and decreases anxiety levels. Using astrocyte-specific gain and loss of function and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that a morphologically distinct subpopulation of astrocytes expresses OT receptors and mediates anxiolytic and positive reinforcement effects of OT in the central amygdala of mice and rats. The involvement of astrocytes in OT signaling challenges the long-held dogma that OT acts exclusively on neurons and highlights astrocytes as essential components for modulation of emotional states under normal and chronic pain conditions."

https://openalex.org/W3130495829,"The order Carnivora, which currently includes 296 species classified into 16 families, is distributed across all continents. The phylogeny and the timing of diversification of members of the order are still a matter of debate. Here, complete mitochondrial genomes were analysed to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships and to estimate divergence times among species of Carnivora. We assembled 51 new mitogenomes from 13 families, and aligned them with available mitogenomes by selecting only those showing more than 1% of nucleotide divergence and excluding those suspected to be of low-quality or from misidentified taxa. Our final alignment included 220 taxa representing 2,442 mitogenomes. Our analyses led to a robust resolution of suprafamilial and intrafamilial relationships. We identified 21 fossil calibration points to estimate a molecular timescale for carnivorans. According to our divergence time estimates, crown carnivorans appeared during or just after the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum; all major groups of Caniformia (Cynoidea/Arctoidea; Ursidae; Musteloidea/Pinnipedia) diverged from each other during the Eocene, while all major groups of Feliformia (Nandiniidae; Feloidea; Viverroidea) diversified more recently during the Oligocene, with a basal divergence of Nandinia at the Eocene/Oligocene transition; intrafamilial divergences occurred during the Miocene, except for the Procyonidae, as Potos separated from other genera during the Oligocene."
https://openalex.org/W3130541030,"Experimental research controls for past experience, yet prior experience influences how we learn. Here, we tested whether we could recruit a neural population that usually encodes rewards to encode aversive events. Specifically, we found that GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) were not involved in learning about fear in naïve rats. However, if these rats had prior experience with rewards, LH GABAergic neurons became important for learning about fear. Interestingly, inhibition of these neurons paradoxically enhanced learning about neutral sensory information, regardless of prior experience, suggesting that LH GABAergic neurons normally oppose learning about irrelevant information. These experiments suggest that prior experience shapes the neural circuits recruited for future learning in a highly specific manner, reopening the neural boundaries we have drawn for learning of particular types of information from work in naïve subjects."

In our recent study of homologous β(1,3)-glucan utilization loci (1,3GULs) from Bacteroides uniformis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and B. fluxus, we demonstrated that growth on individual branched β(1,3)-glucans and/or MLG is dependent on the combinatorial specificities of cognate GHs and SGBPs encoded by each species.

Here, we explore the structural basis underlying the specificity of the three orthologous SGBPs-A (SusD homologs) and the three sequence-diverse SGBPs-B through X-ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry with defined oligosaccharides. In doing so, we uncover unique structural architectures that allow recognition of distinct classes of β-glucan. PULs classically encode two distinct types of SGBPs. SGBPs-A (also referred to as SusD-like or SusD-homologs) are highly conserved across PUL systems, in which they form the extracellular lid of an active transport complex with the cognate TBDT (SusC homologs) (27Bolam D.N.

On the other hand, PULs often encode one or more additional, often highly sequence-divergent, SGBP(s) immediately downstream of the SGBP-A (susD) homolog, here denoted as SGBP-B (30Tauzin A.S.

The 1,3GULs from B. uniformis ATCC8492, B. thetaiotaomicron NLAE-zl-H207, and B. fluxus YIT12057 each encode one SGBP-A and one SGBP-B (Fig. 1, B and C), the tertiary structures of which we determined in free and oligosaccharide-complexed forms. All three SGBPs-A are predicted to be outer membrane surface-anchored via a cysteine lipidation at the N terminus of their respective mature polypeptides (Cys22 in BuSGBP-A, Cys21 in BtSGBP-A, Cys22 in BfSGBP-A (38Juncker A.S.

Predicting secretory proteins with SignalP.Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1611: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar)). Hence, the recombinant forms of these proteins were produced with both the native signal peptide and the cysteine removed. Diffraction quality crystals of BuSGBP-A, BtSGBP-A, and BfSGBP-A were successfully grown following varying amounts of optimization. Crystals of BtSGBP-A required micro seeding to reproduce crystallization screen hits, while the morphology and diffraction quality of BuSGBP-A were significantly improved by the addition of hexamminecobalt(III) chloride (see Experimental procedures and Fig. S1A). Experimental phases for BuSGBP-A were obtained by single anomalous dispersion at the cobalt absorption edge (Table S1). There are two ordered cobalt sites with significant anomalous signal, one per each of two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Both hexamminecobalt(III) complexes were found to mediate crystal contacts to molecules in neighboring asymmetric units, explaining the improved diffraction (Fig. S1, B and C). Coordinates were refined to a final resolution of 1.85 Å against a higher resolution data set collected at shorter wavelength (Table S1). The completed model of both molecules in the asymmetric unit comprised residues 43 to 529 with unmodeled gaps at residues 176 to 177, 211 to 219, 293 to 308, and 390 to 394, due to lack of corresponding electron density (Fig. 2A). The crystal structures of BtSGBP-A and BfSGBP-A were solved to 1.80 Å and 1.84 Å, respectively, by molecular replacement using the BuSGBP-A structure as a search model (Table S1). Both consist of a single molecule in their respective asymmetric units and the resulting electron density allowed near-complete tracing of the protein model comprising residues 38 to 515 for BtSGBP-A and residues 40 to 510 for BfSGBP-A (Fig. 2A). As observed for BuSGBP-A, the first ca. 20 amino acids in both proteins were disordered, suggesting that these form flexible tethers from the cell surface in the native lipoproteins. Otherwise, the only unmodeled gaps in the BtSGBP-A and BfSGBP-A structures correspond to residues 172 to 179 and residues 172 to 175, respectively. The C termini were defined in the electron density of all three SGBPs-A. The three orthologous SGBPs-A were all observed to possess the canonical SusD fold with tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) prominently forming the structural scaffold (Fig. 2A) (40Koropatkin N.M. Martens E.C. Gordon J.I. Smith T.J. Starch catabolism by a prominent human gut symbiont is directed by the recognition of amylose helices.Structure. 2008; 16: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The structures are almost identical and superpose with low pairwise root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values, which negatively correlate with amino acid sequence identity, as expected (Fig. 2B, Table S2). One prominent difference is the insertion of an α-helix at the periphery of BtSGBP-A (residues 346–353), which is not present in BuSGBP-A nor BfSGBP-A. The functional significance of this additional helix, if any, is unknown. Other differences in the observed residues are restricted to minor variations in the positioning of surface loops. Soaking of the native BtSGBP-A with laminarihexaose yielded a 2.05 Å ligand-complexed structure (Table S1) that clearly revealed an extended β(1,3)-glucan-binding platform, notably comprising two key tryptophan residues (Trp288 and Trp318) and specific recognition of the nonreducing end by multiple hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2). Electron density was observed for all six glucosyl residues, which were convincingly modeled in the favored 4C1 conformation (Fig. 2C, Table S2). The bound laminarihexaose molecule adopts an extended helical structure with the binding surface complementing a low-energy conformation of the oligosaccharide (41Bacic A. Fincher G.B. Stone B.A. Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Biology of 1-3 Beta Glucans and Related Polysaccharides. Academic Press, Cambridge, MA2009Google Scholar). As is typical for β(1,3)-glucans, hydrogen bonds between the ring oxygen and the C4-OH of the adjacent glucosyl residue are observed, except between Glc3 and Glc4. Here, there is a ca. 180° flip in the ϕ (O5-C1-O3’-C3’) angle of the glycosidic bond between Glc3 and Glc4, imparting an additional twist in the helix. BtSGBP-A residues involved in binding interactions with the hexasaccharide are borne on a polypeptide connecting the two α-helices comprising TPR1 (residues 59–107) and the TPR3 and TPR4 domains (residues 279–398). A bis-tris molecule observed in the original native structure was displaced by the nonreducing-end glucose (Fig. S2), which displays a very favorable carbohydrate–aromatic interaction with Trp319 (Fig. 2, D–F). In addition, four hydrogen bonds between C3-OH and Arg367-Nη1, C4-OH and Arg367-Nη2, C4-OH and Asp90-Oδ1, and C6-OH and Asp90-Oδ2 firmly anchor the nonreducing-end glucose in place. The strength of these collective interactions is reflected in the comparatively very low B-factor of Glc6 (Fig. 2D). In this context it is also worth noting that Tyr306 is well positioned to firmly hold Arg367 in place via a π–cation interaction. Trp288 partially stacks against both Glc5 and Glc4, with the former also hydrogen bonding to Tyr67 via the C4-OH, and the latter exhibiting water-mediated hydrogen bonding to Glu393 via the C2-OH (Fig. 2E). The only interaction to Glc3 is a hydrogen bond between Ser391 and the C2-OH resulting in a higher B-factor on the C5 side of the ring (Fig. 2D). Glc2 and Glc1 both hydrogen-bond to the same Oδ of Asp287 via their respective C2-OH groups (Fig. 2E). Additional hydrogen bonds were observed between Ser390 and the glycosidic oxygen connecting Glc2 and Glc1, as well as between the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Lys389 and the C4-OH of Glc1. Finally, a possible CH–π interaction between Glc2 and the amide bond between Ser390 and Ser391, as well as hydrophobic interaction between Glc1 and Val285, may also contribute to binding at these sites (Fig. 2E). Overall, the native and laminarihexaose-complexed structures of BtSGBP-A are virtually identical, superposing with an RMSD value of 0.19 Å over 402 Cα pairs (Fig. S2C). The key binding site residues are also in essentially identical positions except for Ser391 and Glu393, which upon binding laminarihexaose rotate to participate in direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonding, respectively (Fig. 2E). Despite BtSGBP-A binding the nonreducing end of the glycan chain in a manner reminiscent of a type-C carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) (42Gilbert H.J. Knox J.P. Boraston A.B. Advances in understanding the molecular basis of plant cell wall polysaccharide recognition by carbohydrate-binding modules.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2013; 23: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), the binding pocket is not prominent and rather constitutes a binding platform that is blocked on one end (Fig. 2, C and D). Indeed, this extended binding site requires a β(1,3)-glucan substrate with a degree of polymerization (DP) ≥ 5 to effect binding, as revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). BtSGBP-A bound laminarihexaose (KD 26 μM) approximately tenfold tighter than laminaripentaose (KD 210 μM), whereas binding to laminaritriose and laminaritetraose was too weak to be quantified (Fig. S4, Table S4). Likewise, soaking native BtSGBP-A crystals with laminaritriose did not yield a trisaccharide-complexed structure. In the biological context, our previous affinity gel electrophoresis (AGE) and ITC analyses using polysaccharides demonstrated that BtSGBP-A is responsible for binding β(1,3)-glucans with varying degrees and lengths of β(1,6)-linked glucosyl branching (25Déjean G. Tamura K. Cabrera A. Jain N. Pudlo N.A. Pereira G. Viborg A.H. Van Petegem F. Martens E.C. Brumer H.

The laminarihexaose complex here reveals the abundance of space around the C6-OH group at every glucose binding subsite, thereby rationalizing this versatility (Fig. 2D). Despite extensive efforts, including soaking and cocrystallization trials, we were not able to obtain a structure of BfSGBP-A in complex with a laminarioligosaccharide. However, sequence alignment combined with structural superposition reveals that many of the key binding site res"

This study has explored genetic population structure in both the rabies virus and its fox hosts to better understand factors that impact rabies spread. Phylogenetic analysis of 278 samples of the Arctic lineage of rabies virus recovered over 40 years identified four sub-lineages, A1 to A4. The A1 lineage has been restricted to southern regions of the Canadian province of Ontario. The A2 lineage, which predominates in Siberia, has also spread to northern Alaska while the A4 lineage was recovered from southern Alaska only. The A3 sub-lineage, which was also found in northern Alaska, has been responsible for virtually all cases across northern Canada and Greenland, where it further differentiated into 18 groups which have systematically evolved from a common predecessor since 1975. In areas of Arctic and red fox sympatry, viral groups appear to circulate in both hosts, but both mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and 9-locus microsatellite genotypes revealed contrasting phylogeographic patterns for the two fox species. Among 157 Arctic foxes, 33 mitochondrial control region haplotypes were identified but little genetic structure differentiating localities was detected. Among 162 red foxes, 18 control region haplotypes delineated three groups which discriminated among the Churchill region of Manitoba, northern Quebec and Labrador populations, and the coastal Labrador locality of Cartwright. Microsatellite analyses demonstrated some genetic heterogeneity among sampling localities of Arctic foxes but no obvious pattern, while two or three clusters of red foxes suggested some admixture between the Churchill and Quebec-Labrador regions but uniqueness of the Cartwright group. The limited population structure of Arctic foxes is consistent with the rapid spread of rabies virus subtypes throughout the north, while red fox population substructure suggests that disease spread in this host moves most readily down certain independent corridors such as the northeastern coast of Canada and the central interior. Interestingly the evidence suggests that these red fox populations have limited capacity to maintain the virus over the long term, but they may contribute to viral persistence in areas of red and Arctic fox sympatry."
https://openalex.org/W3131647478,"Background Primary immunodeficiency diseases represent an expanding set of heterogeneous conditions which are difficult to recognize clinically. Diagnostic rates outside of the newborn period have not changed appreciably. This concern underscores a need for novel methods of disease detection. Objective We built a Bayesian network to provide real-time risk assessment about primary immunodeficiency and to facilitate prescriptive analytics for initiating the most appropriate diagnostic work up. Our goal is to improve diagnostic rates for primary immunodeficiency and shorten time to diagnosis. We aimed to use readily available health record data and a small training dataset to prove utility in diagnosing patients with relatively rare features. Methods We extracted data from the Texas Children’s Hospital electronic health record on a large population of primary immunodeficiency patients (n = 1762) and appropriately-matched set of controls (n = 1698). From the cohorts, clinically relevant prior probabilities were calculated enabling construction of a Bayesian network probabilistic model(PI Prob). Our model was constructed with clinical-immunology domain expertise, trained on a balanced cohort of 100 cases-controls and validated on an unseen balanced cohort of 150 cases-controls. Performance was measured by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). We also compared our network performance to classic machine learning model performance on the same dataset. Results PI Prob was accurate in classifying immunodeficiency patients from controls (AUROC = 0.945; p&lt;0.0001) at a risk threshold of ≥6%. Additionally, the model was 89% accurate for categorizing validation cohort members into appropriate International Union of Immunological Societies diagnostic categories. Our network outperformed 3 other machine learning models and provides superior transparency with a prescriptive output element. Conclusion Artificial intelligence methods can classify risk for primary immunodeficiency and guide management. PI Prob enables accurate, objective decision making about risk and guides the user towards the appropriate diagnostic evaluation for patients with recurrent infections. Probabilistic models can be trained with small datasets underscoring their utility for rare disease detection given appropriate domain expertise for feature selection and network construction."
https://openalex.org/W3132140924,"Human rotavirus (HRV) is a leading cause of diarrhea in children. It causes significant morbidity and mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where HRV vaccine efficacy is low. The probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle (EcN) 1917 has been widely used in the treatment of enteric diseases in humans. However, repeated doses of EcN are required to achieve maximum beneficial effects. Administration of EcN on a microsphere biofilm could increase probiotic stability and persistence, thus maximizing health benefits without repeated administrations. Our aim was to investigate immune enhancement by the probiotic EcN adhered to a dextranomar microsphere biofilm (EcN biofilm) in a neonatal, malnourished piglet model transplanted with human infant fecal microbiota (HIFM) and infected with rotavirus. To create malnourishment, pigs were fed a reduced amount of bovine milk. Decreased HRV fecal shedding and protection from diarrhea were evident in the EcN biofilm treated piglets compared with EcN suspension and control groups. Moreover, EcN biofilm treatment enhanced natural killer cell activity in blood mononuclear cells (MNCs). Increased frequencies of activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in systemic and intestinal tissues and activated conventional dendritic cells (cDC) in blood and duodenum were also observed in EcN biofilm as compared with EcN suspension treated pigs. Furthermore, EcN biofilm treated pigs had increased frequencies of systemic activated and resting/memory antibody forming B cells and IgA + B cells in the systemic tissues. Similarly, the mean numbers of systemic and intestinal HRV-specific IgA antibody secreting cells (ASCs), as well as HRV-specific IgA antibody titers in serum and small intestinal contents, were increased in the EcN biofilm treated group. In summary EcN biofilm enhanced innate and B cell immune responses after HRV infection and ameliorated diarrhea following HRV challenge in a malnourished, HIFM pig model."
https://openalex.org/W3130764238,"Resource managers in the Pacific Northwest (USA) actively thin second-growth forests to accelerate the development of late-successional conditions and seek to expand these restoration thinning treatments into riparian zones. Riparian forest thinning, however, may impact stream temperatures–a key water quality parameter often regulated to protect stream habitat and aquatic organisms. To better understand the effects of riparian thinning on shade, light, and stream temperature, we employed a manipulative field experiment following a replicated Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design in three watersheds in the redwood forests of northern California, USA. Thinning treatments were intended to reduce canopy closure or basal area within the riparian zone by up to 50% on both sides of the stream channel along a 100–200 m stream reach. We found that responses to thinning ranged widely depending on the intensity of thinning treatments. In the watersheds with more intensive treatments, thinning reduced shade, increased light, and altered stream thermal regimes in thinned and downstream reaches. Thinning shifted thermal regimes by increasing maximum temperatures, thermal variability, and the frequency and duration of elevated temperatures. These thermal responses occurred primarily during summer but also extended into spring and fall. Longitudinal profiles indicated that increases in temperature associated with thinning frequently persisted downstream, but downstream effects depended on the magnitude of upstream temperature increases. Model selection analyses indicated that local changes in shade as well as upstream thermal conditions and proximity to upstream treatments explained variation in stream temperature responses to thinning. In contrast, in the study watershed with less intensive thinning, smaller changes in shade and light resulted in minimal stream temperature responses. Collectively, our data shed new light on the stream thermal responses to riparian thinning. These results provide relevant information for managers considering thinning as a viable restoration strategy for second-growth riparian forests."

We discuss our illumination strategy and compare several procedures for postprocessing the acquired image data. We assessed the performance of this system for rejecting out-of-focus light by comparing images taken at 1.4 NA using our widefield microscope, our SLM-enhanced setup, and a commercial confocal microscope. The optical sectioning capability, assessed on thin fluorescent film, was 0.85 ± 0.04 μm for our SLM-enhanced setup and 0.68 ± 0.04 μm for a confocal microscope, while a widefield microscope exhibited no sectioning capability. We demonstrate our setup by imaging the same set of neurons in C . elegans on widefield, SLM, and confocal microscopes. SLM enhancement greatly reduces background from the cell body, allowing visualization of dim fibers nearby.

This study focused on determining the post-rehabilitation survival and spatial ecology of sea turtles and on comparing the movements of individuals with flipper amputations (amputees) to non-amputee animals. Our aims were to assess whether rehabilitated sea turtles survive after release, to compare and contrast the movement characteristics of the different species of sea turtles we tracked, and to examine whether amputees and non-amputees within species behaved similarly post-release. Twenty-six rehabilitated sea turtles from four species, including hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata (n = 12), loggerhead Caretta caretta (n = 11), green Chelonia mydas (n = 2), and olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea (n = 1) sea turtles from the United Arab Emirates were fitted with satellite tags before release. Rehabilitation times ranged from 89 to 817 days (mean 353 ± 237 days). Post-release movements and survival were monitored for 8 to 387 days (mean 155 ± 95 days) through satellite tracking. Tag data suggested that three tracked sea turtles died within four days of release, one after 27 days, and one after 192 days from what are thought to be anthropogenic factors unrelated to their pre-rehabilitation ailments. We then compared habitat use and movement characteristics among the different sea turtle species. Although half of all turtles crossed one or more international boundaries, dispersal varied among species. Loggerhead turtles had a high dispersal, with 80% crossing an international boundary, while hawksbill turtles displayed higher post-release residency, with 66% remaining within UAE territorial waters. Amputee turtles moved similarly to non-amputee animals of the same species. Loggerhead turtles travelled faster (mean ± sd = 15.3 ± 8 km/day) than hawksbill turtles (9 ± 7 km/day). Both amputee and non-amputee sea turtles within a species moved similarly. Our tracking results highlight that rehabilitated sea turtles, including amputees, can successfully survive in the wild following release for up to our ~one-year monitoring time therefore supporting the suitability for release of sea turtles that have recovered from major injuries such as amputations. However, more broadly, the high mortality from anthropogenic factors in the Arabian Gulf region is clearly a serious issue and conservation challenge."

Shiraz) as a source of beneficial bioactive compounds in ruminant diets is limited by high levels of indigestible compounds in the grape skin matrix. This problem demands innovative, inexpensive, and easy-to-use strategies that improve the digestibility of GP. The bioconversion of GP using edible oyster mushrooms ( Pleurotus ostreatus ) is one such strategy that has not been previously explored. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of cultivating oyster mushrooms on GP on chemical composition and in vitro ruminal fermentation parameters of the spent mushroom substrate. The GP was inoculated with oyster mushroom spawns at 0, 200, 300, 400, or 500 g/kg, and incubated for 4 weeks. Organic matter, acid detergent lignin, sodium, manganese, cobalt, and copper linearly declined ( P &lt; 0.05) as spawn rates increased. A quadratic trend was observed for crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium content in response to increasing spawn rates. Higher spawning rates (20–50%) had a positive effect ( P &lt; 0.05) on gas production from the immediately fermentable fraction ( a ), rate of gas production from the slowly fermentable fraction ( c ) and effective gas production. However, gas production from the slowly fermentable fraction ( b ) and potential gas production linearly declined in response to increasing spawning rates. There was a linear increase ( P &lt; 0.05) in the immediately degradable fraction ( a ), while quadratic effects were observed for partition factors, effective degradability, and in vitro organic matter degradability at 48 h in response to spawning rates. It can be concluded that inoculating GP with oyster mushroom spawn reduced fibre content while increasing crude protein content and in vitro ruminal fermentation efficiency of red grape pomace. Based on the quadratic responses of partition factors at 48 hours post-inoculation, the optimum spawning rate for maximum ruminal fermentation efficiency of GP was determined to be 300 g/kg."
https://openalex.org/W3130928111,"Introduction Despite skilled attendance during childbirth has been linked with the reduction of maternal deaths, equality in accessing this safe childbirth care is highly needed to achieving universal maternal health coverage. However, little information is available regarding the extent of inequalities in accessing safe childbirth care in Tanzania. This study was performed to assess the current extent, trend, and potential contributors of poor-rich inequalities in accessing safe childbirth care among women in Tanzania. Methods This study used data from 2004, 2010, and 2016 Tanzania Demographic Health Surveys. The two maternal health services 1) institutional delivery and 2) skilled birth attendance was used to measures access to safe childbirth care. The inequalities were assessed by using concentration curves and concentration indices. The decomposition analysis was computed to identify the potential contributors to the inequalities in accessing safe childbirth care. Results A total of 8725, 8176, and 10052 women between 15 and 49 years old from 2004, 2010, and 2016 surveys respectively were included in the study. There is an average gap (&gt;50%) between the poorest and richest in accessing safe childbirth care during the study period. The concentration curves were below the line of inequality which means women from rich households have higher access to the institutional delivery and skilled birth attendance inequalities in accessing institutional delivery and skilled birth attendance. These were also, confirmed with their respective positive concentration indices. The decomposition analysis was able to unveil that household’s wealth status, place of residence, and maternal education as the major contributors to the persistent inequalities in accessing safe childbirth care. Conclusion The calls for an integrated policy approach which includes fiscal policies, social protection, labor market, and employment policies need to improve education and wealth status for women from poor households. This might be the first step toward achieving universal maternal health coverage."

We explain why some universities used social media to communicate with stakeholders sooner than others. To do so, we identified the date of the first Covid-19 related tweet posted by each university in the country and used survival models to estimate the effect of university-specific characteristics on the timing of these messages. In order to confirm our results, we supplemented our analysis with a study of the introduction of coronavirus-related university webpages. We find that universities with large numbers of students are more likely to use social media and the web to speak about the pandemic sooner than institutions with fewer students. Universities with large financial resources are also more likely to tweet sooner, but they do not introduce Covid-19 webpages faster than other universities. We also find evidence of a strong process of emulation, whereby universities are more likely to post a coronavirus-related tweet or webpage if other universities have already done so."

The use of passive acoustic monitoring—which relies on long-term autonomous recorders—can provide insight into the behavior of visually cryptic, yet vocal species such as the great argus. Here we report the results of an analysis of vocal behavior of the Bornean great argus ( Argusianus argus grayi ) in Sabah, Malaysia, using data collected with 11 autonomous recording units. Great argus regularly emitted two call types, the long call and the short call, and we found that although both call types were emitted throughout the day, the short calls were more likely to occur during the morning hours (06:00–12:00LT). Great argus were less likely to call if there was rain, irrespective of the time of day. A substantial portion of calls at our site (~20%) were emitted between the hours of 18:00–06:00LT. We found that for nighttime calls, calling activity increased during new moon periods and decreased during periods of rain. We attribute the negative influence of rain on calling to increased energetic costs of thermoregulation during wet periods, and propose that the influence of the lunar cycle may be related to increased predation risk during periods with high levels of moonlight. Little is known about the behavioral ecology of great argus on Borneo, so it is difficult to know if the results we report are typical, or if we would see differences in calling activity patterns depending on breeding season or changes in food availability.

It is characterized by significant deficits in vibration and tactile sensation. With an annual incidence of 2%, it affects as many as 110 million people worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess factors associated with peripheral neuropathy among diabetic patients in chronic care clinic in Gamo and Gofa zone, South Ethiopia. Methods An institution- based unmatched case control study was employed among 528 randomly selected participants using a pre-tested, interviewer-administered, and structured questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identifiy determinants of peripheral neuropathy using IBM SPSS version 25. Result The odds of being an urban dweller was 2.67 times higher among cases than controls [AOR = 2.67 (1.27, 5.63)]. The likelihood of fasting blood glucose level between 203 and 282 and 282 and above was 2.55 and 3.88 times higher among cases than controls [AOR = 2.55 (1.91, 7.16)] and [AOR = 3.88 (1.42, 10.60)] respectively. The probability of living with diabetes mellitus for 10 and more years was 3.88 times higher among cases than controls [AOR = 3.88 (1.42, 10.60)]. The odds of controlling glucose level after developing symptom was 5.33 times higher among cases than controls [AOR = 5.33 (1.28, 12.24)]. The probability of having high blood pressure was 2.36 times higher among cases than controls [AOR = 2.36 (1.26, 4.43)]. The likelihood of having a family history of complication from diabetes mellitus was 5.60 times higher among cases than controls [AOR = 5.60 (2.03, 15.43)]. The odds of exercising 3 times per week for 15 to 30 minutes and for less than 15 minutes were 2.96 and 4.92 times higher among cases than controls respectively [AOR = 2.96 (1.32, 6.61)] and AOR = 4.92, 95% CI (1.85, 13.04) respectively. The likelihood of having a waist circumference greater than or equal to 40 inch was 2.72 times higher among cases than controls [AOR = 2.72 (1.07, 6.94)]. Conclusion This study showed that residence, duration of diabetic mellitus, family history of complication from diabetic mellitus, level of fasting blood glucose, method of glycemic control, having a high blood pressure/hypertension/, frequency and duration of physical activity and waist circumference were found to be determinants of peripheral neuropathy. Thus, the concerned health authorities and health professionals should target on these factors in their efforts to prevent peripheral neuropathy among diabetics in the study area."
https://openalex.org/W3129846610,"In animal models of stroke, behavioral assessments could be complemented by a variety of neuroimaging studies to correlate them with recovery and better understand mechanisms of improvement after stem cell therapy. We evaluated morphological and connectivity changes after treatment with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in a rat stroke model, through quantitative measurement of T 2 -weighted images and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion rats randomly received PBS (PBS-only), FBS cultured hMSCs (FBS-hMSCs), or stroke patients’ serum cultured hMSCs (SS-hMSCs). Functional improvement was assessed using a modified neurological severity score (mNSS). Quantitative analyses of T 2 -weighted ischemic lesion and ventricular volume changes were performed. Brain microstructure/connectivity changes were evaluated in the ischemic recovery area by DTI-derived microstructural indices such as relative fractional anisotropy (rFA), relative axial diffusivity (rAD), and relative radial diffusivity (rRD), and relative fiber density (rFD) analyses. According to mNSS results, the SS-hMSCs group showed the most prominent functional improvement. Infarct lesion volume of the SS-hMSCs group was significantly decreased at 2 weeks when compared to the PBS-only groups, but there were no differences between the FBS-hMSCs and SS-hMSCs groups. Brain atrophy was significantly decreased in the SS-hMSCs group compared to the other groups. In DTI, rFA and rFD values were significantly higher and rRD value was significant lower in the SS-hMSCs group and these microstructure/connectivity changes were correlated with T 2 -weighted morphological changes. T 2 -weighted volume alterations (ischemic lesion and brain atrophy), and DTI microstructural indices and rFD changes, were well matched with the results of behavioral assessment. These quantitative MRI measurements could be potential outcome predictors of functional recovery after treatment with stem cells for stroke."
https://openalex.org/W3132119949,"A pervasive issue in statistical learning has been to determine the parameters of regularity extraction. Our hypothesis was that the extraction of transitional probabilities can prevail over frequency if the task involves prediction. Participants were exposed to four repeated sequences of three stimuli ( XYZ ) with each stimulus corresponding to the position of a red dot on a touch screen that participants were required to touch sequentially. The temporal and spatial structure of the positions corresponded to a serial version of the exclusive-or (XOR) that allowed testing of the respective effect of frequency and first- and second-order transitional probabilities. The XOR allowed the first-order transitional probability to vary while being not completely related to frequency and to vary while the second-order transitional probability was fixed ( p ( Z | X , Y ) = 1). The findings show that first-order transitional probability prevails over frequency to predict the second stimulus from the first and that it also influences the prediction of the third item despite the presence of second-order transitional probability that could have offered a certain prediction of the third item. These results are particularly informative in light of statistical learning models."
https://openalex.org/W3131917314,"Background Reference interval (RI) for hematological parameters is used to interpret laboratory test results in the diagnosis, management and monitoring of hematologic disorders. Several factors including sex, age, dietary patterns, pregnancy status, ethnicity and geographic location affect hematological RIs. However, manufacturers derived reference value is currently in use in most developing countries including Ethiopia. This study aimed to establish hematological RIs for adult population living in Dire Dawa town, East Ethiopia. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 513 apparently healthy adults of Dire Dawa town were enrolled from January to March 2019. From these, 342 (171 males and 171 non-pregnant females) were aged 18–65 years while 171 were pregnant women aged 15–49 years. After obtaining written informed consent, 5ml fresh whole blood was collected of which 2ml was used for hematologic analysis using Mindray BC-3000plus hematology analyzer and 3ml for serological tests. The 2.5 th and 97.5 th RI was computed by non-parametric test employing SPSS version 24. P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result Males had significantly higher reference value for most of red cell parameters (Hgb, RBC, HCT, MCH and MCHC) than females (p &lt;0.05), while most of the WBC parameters were significantly higher in females than males. Moreover, non-pregnant women had higher values for most of red cell parameters than pregnant women. Pregnant women had higher WBC parameters than their non-pregnant counterparts. Conclusion The hematologic RIs obtained in this study shows variation between genders, between pregnant and non-pregnant women, from the clinical practice currently utilised in Dire Dawa town and from studies conducted in Ethiopia, African countries as well as the Western population. It underscores the need for utilising gender and pregnancy specific, locally derived hematologic RI for better management, diagnosis and monitoring of hematologic disorders for adults of both genders and pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W3131983134,"A fossil oyster bed ( Ostrea edulis ) was recently encountered offshore Helgoland (German Bight). Oysters are important filter feeders in marine environments and their habitat structure supports a large associated biodiversity. The European flat oyster Ostrea edulis has historically occurred in vast populations in the North Sea, but declined massively in the early 20th century. The ecological restoration of Ostrea habitats is a current focal point in the North Sea. To better understand the mechanisms that caused the local collapse of the oyster population, this study investigated the size structure, weight, and age of the shells, along with the spatial dimensions, seafloor properties, and environmental context of the oyster bed. The results show that the demise of the population occurred around 700 CE, ruling out excessive harvest as a driver of decline. Synchronicity of increased geomorphological activity of rivers and concurrent major land use changes in early medieval Europe suggest that increased sedimentation was a viable stressor that reduced the performance of the oysters. The shells provided no indication of a demographically poor state of the oyster bed prior to its demise, but manifested evidence of the wide-spread occurrence of the boring sponge Cliona sp. Our study challenges the assumption of a stable preindustrial state of the European flat oyster in the North Sea, and we conclude that the long-term variability of environmental conditions needs to be addressed to benchmark success criteria for the restoration of O . edulis ."

We further identified that a non-AUG uORF within the 5’ untranslated region of γ-globin serves as a barrier for translation, which is bypassed upon PRMT1 deficiency.

A switch from fetal globin (HbF, consists of two α and γ subunits) to adult globin (HbA, consists of two α and β subunits) is a key step of human erythropoiesis during development. However, inherited mutations in the β subunit globin gene render either a dysfunction or a decrease of β-globin protein, thereby causing hemoglobinopathies including β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) (1Bank A.

On the other hand, however, studies have pointed out that the final production of γ-globin protein does not always correlates with the transcription of γ-globin gene (15Chakalova L. Osborne C.S. Dai Y.F. Goyenechea B. Metaxotou-Mavromati A. Kattamis A. Kattamis C. Fraser P. The Corfu deltabeta thalassemia deletion disrupts gamma-globin gene silencing and reveals post-transcriptional regulation of HbF expression.Blood. 2005; 105: 2154-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and that γ-globin protein alters even before any changes in the γ-globin mRNA level happen (16Weinberg R.S. Ji X. Sutton M. Perrine S. Galperin Y. Li Q. Liebhaber S.A. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Atweh G.F. Butyrate increases the efficiency of translation of gamma-globin mRNA.Blood. 2005; 105: 1807-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These works strongly suggest that despite transcriptional regulation, the posttranscriptional regulation, for example, translation of γ-globin mRNA is also a key determinnat of the fetal globin production. A recent work has suggested that γ-globin is notably controlled at the translational level by integrated stress response (ISR) pathway (17Hahn C.K. Lowrey C.H. Induction of fetal hemoglobin through enhanced translation efficiency of gamma-globin mRNA.Blood. 2014; 124: 2730-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it remains unclear how this translational regulation is achieved. Furthermore, others also addressed that inducing the stress signaling may eventually render a transcriptional suppression of the γ-globin gene (18Huang P. Peslak S.A. Lan X. Khandros E. Yano J.A. Sharma M. Keller C.A. Giardine B. Qin K. Abdulmalik O. Hardison R.C. Shi J. Blobel G.A. The HRI-regulated transcription factor ATF4 activates BCL11A transcription to silence fetal hemoglobin expression.Blood. 2020; 135: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether activating integrated stress response can serve as a therapy for hemoglobinopathies requires a careful investigation, and a new strategy that can induce γ-globin synthesis both transcriptionally and translationally is urgently needed. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), consisting of nine family members including type I PRMTs (PRMT1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8) and type II PRMTs (PRMT5 and 9), are a group of catalytic enzymes that modify the arginine methylation on key proteins involved in the gene expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (19Yang Y. Bedford M.T. Protein arginine methyltransferases and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Due to its role in mediating the histone H4R3me2s, a transcriptional repressive mark on several loci including the γ-globin gene, PRMT5 has been discovered as a key suppressor of γ-globin gene expression, which can be utilized as a target for treating β-thalassemia (10Zhao Q. Rank G. Tan Y.T. Li H. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Cerruti L. Curtis D.J. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M.

Identification of a PRMT5-dependent repressor complex linked to silencing of human fetal globin gene expression.Blood. 2010; 116: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although most PRMTs methylate glycine- and arginine-rich motifs, and often share substrates, various PRMT members are not redundant in eukaryotic cells. This is likely due to a substrate preference in vivo, for example, Prmt4 (also named Carm1)-knockout cells exhibit hypomethylation in polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABP1) (21Yadav N. Lee J. Kim J. Shen J. Hu M.C. Aldaz C.M. Bedford M.T. Specific protein methylation defects and gene expression perturbations in coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1-deficient mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6464-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), while PRMT6 silencing mainly resulted in a repression of histone H3 arginine 2 (H3R2) methylation (22Guccione E. Bassi C. Casadio F. Martinato F. Cesaroni M. Schuchlautz H. Luscher B. Amati B. Methylation of histone H3R2 by PRMT6 and H3K4 by an MLL complex are mutually exclusive.Nature. 2007; 449: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In this respect, whether the vast majority of other PRMTs can also participate in regulating γ-globin expression remains largely unknown. In this study, to investigate the functions of PRMTs in γ-globin expression, we performed a systematic silencing of each individual PRMTs. Several PRMTs have shown potential in suppressing γ-globin transcription. Surprisingly, PRMT1, a major methyltransferase, catalyzing the mono- or asymmetric dimethylations of a large number of substrates, is a key PRMT that regulates γ-globin expression at the translational level. We show that blocking PRMT1 mediates the bypassing of a noncanonical upstream open reading frame (uORF) that represses γ-globin mRNA translation, which may associate with the activity of an ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3. Therefore, pharmacologically targeting PRMT1 may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy in treating β-thalassemia. To investigate the role of each PRMTs in γ-globin expression, we first performed PRMTs silencing in human K562 cells using two CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) single guide RNAs (sgRNA) targeting each individual PRMTs in a dCas9-dependent manner. Despite the second sgRNA of PRMT5 failed to inhibit PRMT5 expression, all other sgRNAs successfully blocked the expression of each individual PRMTs (Fig. S1A). Overall, we observed a significant correlation between γ-globin protein alterations and its mRNA expression changes (Fig. 1A, Pearson Correlation r = 0.627, p = 0.0041), suggesting that the regulation of PRMTs on γ-globin expression, if there is any, may happen at its mRNA expression level. Particularly, in accordance to previous publications (10Zhao Q. Rank G. Tan Y.T. Li H. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Cerruti L. Curtis D.J. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M.

PRMT6 and 7 silencing also rendered the upregulation of γ-globin expression at both mRNA and protein level to different extents, suggesting their putative roles in regulating γ-globin expression at its mRNA expression level; while PRMT2 and 9 silencing has no effect (Fig. 1, A–C). Intriguingly, PRMT1 turned out to be the best candidate from the PRMT family that regulates γ-globin at the posttranscriptional level: more than 2.5-fold increase in γ-globin protein, but no effect on γ-globin mRNA expression was observed when PRMT1 was silenced by both sgRNAs (Fig. 1, A and D). Furthermore, the effect on γ-globin protein upregulation correlates with the knockdown efficiency (Fig. 1D). Other PRMTs including PRMT3 and 8 may render a slight augment in γ-globin protein without significant alterations on their mRNA expressions (Figs. 1, A–C and S1B). PRMT1 is a major methyltransferase that catalyzes the mono- or asymmetric dimethylations of a large number of substrates including histones, transcription factors, and RNA-binding proteins. Therefore, PRMT1 may be involved in various gene expression processes, such as transcription and translation, through its catalytic activity. To understand whether the effect of PRMT1 in suppressing γ-globin protein expression is through its catalytic activity, we generate a mutant PRMT1 form of PRMT1 in which five amino acids (GSGTG, aa86–90) located in the S-adenosyl-L-methionine binding motif were deleted (PRMT1 Δ) in K562 cells. This PRMT1 mutant showed a dominant-negative effect on asymmetric dimethylation of arginine residues in protein (Fig. S1C). Noteworthy, K562 cells express sufficient amount of γ-globin mRNA, which may serve as a suitable model to study the posttranscriptional regulation (especially the mRNA translation) of γ-globin. Interestingly, compared with the wild-type PRMT1, overexpressing the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding motif deleted PRMT1 results in a profound upregulation of γ-globin protein expression, without a significant alteration in γ-globin mRNA level (Fig. 1E). These results demonstrated that PRMT1 is a unique methyltransferase that regulates γ-globin posttranscriptionally, potentially at the translational level. To further investigate whether γ-globin is regulated by PRMT1 at the translation level, we examined the distribution of γ-globin mRNAs in polysomes (translationally active ribosome fractions) on sucrose gradient fractionation (Fig. 2, A and B). Compared with its wild-type control, catalytic dead PRMT1 does not affect the overall distribution of mRNAs in monosome and polysome fractions (Fig. 2B), suggesting that abrogating the catalytic activity of PRMT1 does not alter global protein synthesis in K562 cells. By contrast, we observed a higher percentage of γ-globin (HBG1) mRNA accumulated in the translationally active heavy polysome fractions (fractions 11 and 12), while reduced in the translationally inactive monosome or light polysome fractions (fractions 5–9) in catalytic-dead PRMT1-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). This shift in mRNA distribution toward the heavy polysomes was not detected for the control α-tubulin mRNA (Fig. 2D), suggesting that PRMT1 selectively represses the translation of γ-globin mRNA. We next sought to address the mechanism by which γ-globin mRNA translation is suppressed by PRMT1. The translation of mRNAs is often regulated by the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR), which can be composed of several regulatory elements (23Xu Y.C. Ruggero D. The role of translation control in Tumorigenesis and its therapeutic Implications.Annu. Rev. Cancer Biol. 2020; 4: 437-457Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To explore whether the 5’ UTR of γ-globin mRNA is responsible for the translation regulation mediated by PRMT1, we cloned the 5’UTR of γ-globin mRNA before the open reading frame (ORF) of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. The reporter activities (Firefly/Renilla) of these constructs were measured and normalized to their luciferase mRNA levels. We observed that the γ-globin 5’UTR reporter activity was increased significantly when the catalytic activity of PRMT1 is abrogated (Fig. 2E), suggesting that PRMT1 may control γ-globin mRNA translation via the regulatory element within its 5’UTR. We then analyzed the 5’UTR sequence of the γ-globin mRNA. Notably, the 5’UTR of human γ-globin, but not β-globin mRNA, contains six putative alternative translation initiation sites (AITS), which are all out of frame of the AUG initiation codon of the main ORF (Figs. 3A and S2A). If ribosome initiates from these upstream ATISs resulting in the translation of upstream open reading frames (uORFs), the translation of the downstream ORF will be often repressed. Recently, the application of ribosome profiling has revealed thousands of novel initiation events at non-AUG codons (24Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R. Weissman J.S. Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar, 25Ingolia N.T. Lareau L.F. Weissman J.S. Ribosome profiling of mouse embryonic stem cells reveals the complexity and dynamics of mammalian proteomes.Cell. 2011; 147: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Indeed, these putative ATISs within γ-globin 5’UTR are all composed of near-cognate non-AUG codons, one nucleotide different from AUG, which may initiate translation at a reduced efficiency compared with AUG codons. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the initiation from a non-AUG codon can become more efficient when a strong thermostable hairpin structure is present near the codon (26Kozak M. Downstream secondary structure facilitates recognition of initiator codons by eukaryotic ribosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 27Lee S. Liu B.T. Lee S. Huang S.X. Shen B. Qian S.B. Global mapping of translation initiation sites in mammalian cells at single-nucleotide resolution.P Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: E2424-E2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that the 5’UTR of γ-globin mRNA may form a strong hairpin structure (Fig. S2B), which can increase the recognition of these ATISs by the ribosome and thus suppress the translation of downstream main ORF of γ-globin. In order to determine whether these ATISs are indeed functional in repressing γ-globin mRNA translation, we mutated each of the six ATISs without notably affecting the hairpin structure of γ-globin 5’UTR (Fig. S2C) and cloned these 5’UTR sequences into the firefly reporter construct. The reporter activities (Firefly/Renilla) of these constructs in K562 cells were measured and normalized to their luciferase mRNA levels. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that these mutations may affect the binding of some transcription factors or chromatin regulators, their mRNA express levels remained unchange (Firefly/Renilla mRNA ratios are shown in Fig. S2D). Interestingly, only disrupting the third ATIS (AUC codon) resulted in a significant upregulation of the γ-globin 5’UTR reporter activity, while the others did not (Fig. 3B). For decades, studies have provided evidences that specific nucleotide flanking the initiation codon namely the “Kozak sequence” (28Kozak M. Context effects and Inefficient initiation at non-Aug codons in eukaryotic cell-free translation systems.Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) may largely influence the recognition of non-AUG initiation codons, where the A or G nucleotide at position –3 and G nucleotide at position +4 stabilize the interaction of preinitiation complex (PIC) with the initiation codon (29Pisarev A.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Pisareva V.P. Merrick W.C. Hellen C.U.T. Pestova T.V. Specific functional interactions of nucleotides at key (-)3 and (+)4 positions flanking the initiation codon with components of the mammalian 48S translation initiation complex.Gene Dev. 2006; 20: 624-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30Hussain T. Llacer J.L. Fernandez I.S. Munoz A. Martin-Marcos P. Savva C.G. Lorsch J.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Ramakrishnan V. Structural changes enable Start codon recognition by the eukaryotic translation initiation complex.Cell. 2014; 159: 597-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, the Kozak sequence flanking the AUC codon in the γ-globin 5’UTR exhibits the highest strength (Fig. S2E). When mutating the “AUC” initiation codon to the canonical “AUG” codon, we observed a further decrease in the 5’UTR reporter activity (Fig. S2E). These results suggest that the AUC codon initiates a uORF that represses the translation of downstream main ORF of γ-globin. To explore whether PRMT1 suppresses γ-globin mRNA translation through the AUC-mediated uORF, we transfected the 5’UTR reporter constructs into cells stably expressing wild-type and catalytic-dead PRMT1. Intriguingly, mutating the AUC ATIS notably increased the reporter activity in the wild-type cells, while was not able to further enhance the reporter activity in the catalytic-dead PRMT1-expressing cells (Fig. 3C), indicating that PRMT1 deficiency drives the translation of γ-globin mRNA through bypassing the AUC-mediated uORF. Previous studies have addressed that activation of the ISR pathway increases the fetal hemoglobin at the translational level (17Hahn C.K. Lowrey C.H. Induction of fetal hemoglobin through enhanced translation efficiency of gamma-globin mRNA.Blood. 2014; 124: 2730-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Hahn C.K. Lowrey C.H. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha phosphorylation mediates fetal hemoglobin induction through a post-transcriptional mechanism.Blood. 2013; 122: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An outstanding question remaining is whether this translation upregulation upon ISR is through bypassing AUC-mediated uORF within γ-globin 5’UTR. In this respect, we discovered that tunicamycin-induced ISR enhanced the activity of the reporter containing the wild-type γ-globin 5’UTR, but not the AUC codon-mutated one, demonstrating that ISR activation-mediated γ-globin mRNA translation is achieved through bypassing the AUC-mediated uORF (Fig. 3D). However, it is also important to note that activating an important node of the stress response, HRI- eIF2α signaling may also inhibit γ-globin mRNA expression (18Huang P. Peslak S.A. Lan X. Khandros E. Yano J.A. Sharma M. Keller C.A. Giardine B. Qin K. Abdulmalik O. Hardison R.C. Shi J. Blobel G.A. The HRI-regulated transcription factor ATF4 activates BCL11A transcription to silence fetal hemoglobin expression.Blood. 2020; 135: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This is because long-term stress may shut down the synthesis of essential transcription factors important for γ-globin transcription. Therefore, it is likely that short-term stress can indeed increase γ-globin translation through bypassing the uORF, but long-term stress may eventually result in γ-globin reduction due to transcriptional suppression. To understand whether this is the case, we performed tunicamycin treatment for 24 h and also extended the treatment to 48 h. In accordance to previous publications, short-term (24-h) induction of ISR significantly upregulated γ-globin protein (Fig. S2F). Interestingly, at early timepoint (6 h), ISR activation by tunicamycin did not affect γ-globin mRNA expression, while a significant reduction in γ-globin mRNA expression was observed at 24-h by both tunicamycin and thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 3E). Importantly, as a result of the transcription suppression, the γ-globin protein abundance was eliminated, even reduced upon prolonged stress (48-h) (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that even though ISR activation stimulated the translation of γ-globin, the transcription of which was repressed. Thus, activating stress might not be beneficial for γ-globin synthesis eventually, and a strategy to induce uORF-bypassing without reducing γ-globin mRNA expression is urgently needed. The next key question is: what is the underlying mechanism of PRMT1-mediated uORF bypassing? To answer this question, we explored some translation regulators involved in uORF bypassing that may act as a substrate of PRMT1. Interestingly, we observed that PRMT1 could directly interact with an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, DDX3 (Fig. S3A), and mediated its methylation (Fig. S3B). DDX3 is well conserved from yeast to mammal and of great importance for mRNA translation (32Sharma D. Jankowsky E. The Ded1/DDX3 subfamily of DEAD-box RNA helicases.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2014; 49: 343-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that the activity of DDX3 is required for unwinding the RNA structures in 5’ untranslated regions (5’ UTR) of mRNAs, which is key for bypassing the translation from AITS and subsequently mediating protein synthesis from the main ORF (33Guenther U.P. Weinberg D.E. Zubradt M.M. Tedeschi F.A. Stawicki B.N. Zagore L.L. Brar G.A. Licatalosi D.D. Bartel D.P. Weissman J.S. Jankowsky E. The helicase Ded1p controls use of near-cognate translation initiation codons in 5 ' UTRs.Nature. 2018; 559: 130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We therefore questioned whether as a substrate of PRMT1, DDX3 is a key downstream player responsible for PRMT1-mediated γ-globin translational inhibition. Intriguingly, inhibiting DDX3 activity through a specific inhibitor RK33 (34Bol G.M. Vesuna F. Xie M. Zeng J. Aziz K. Gandhi N. Levine A. Irving A. Korz D. Tantravedi S. Heerma van Voss M.R.

Burton A.R. et al.DDX3X acts as a live-or-die checkpoint in stressed cells by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome.Nature. 2019; 573: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) significantly reverted the increase in γ-globin protein abundance mediated by either silencing PRMT1 or expressing its enzyme-dead mutant (Fig. 3G), demonstrating that PRMT1-blockage-mediated γ-globin mRNA translation increase requires DDX3 activity. Furthermore, we have mutated two putative PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation sites on DDX3 [reported previously (36Hsu J.H. Hubbell-Engler B. Adelmant G. Huang J. Joyce C.E. Vazquez F. Weir B.A. Montgomery P. Tsherniak A. Giacomelli A.O. Perry J.A. Trowbridge J. Fujiwara Y. Cowley G.S. Xie H. et al.PRMT1-Mediated translation regulation is a Crucial Vulnerability of cancer.Cancer Res. 2017; 77: 4613-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)] and observed that these mutants on DDX3 (R101 K, R632 K) resulted in a notable increase in the γ-globin protein abundance (Fig. S3C). Together, these results suggest that PRMT1 may inhibit γ-globin translation through mediating DDX3 arginine methylation even though the precise role of PRMT1 in γ-globin translation merits further study. As a barrier of γ-globin translation, AUC-mediated uORF can be bypassed by ISR activation (Figs. 3D and S2F). Therefore, we sought to test whether a compound targeting the ATPase Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ Transporting 2 (ATP2A2) thus inducing ISR can stimulate γ-globin production in a short-term manner.

While acute phase reactants, such as c-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen, have been used to predict complications following TKA, the extent and duration of changes in albumin levels following TKA are unknown. It is hypothesized that like CRP and fibrinogen, albumin, and the fibrinogen/albumin ratio (FAR) represent useful measures of the acute phase response (APR) following TKA. The purpose of this study was to describe the longitudinal course of albumin and FAR in healthy patients following TKA, relative to established biomarkers, and examine if the variance in albumin or FAR correlates with patient comorbidities. Methods This retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing TKA at a tertiary medical center. CRP, fibrinogen, and albumin values were collected pre- and post-operatively. An age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was utilized as a measure of patient comorbidity status. Results The median preoperative albumin value was 4.3 g/dL, which dropped to 3.6 g/dL on postoperative day 1 following TKA. The albumin value returned to 93% of the baseline by postoperative week 2. The course of albumin inversely mirrored the course of CRP (r = -0.41). Median preoperative FAR was 0.087 g/L, which rose to 0.130 g/L by postoperative week 2 and returned to baseline by postoperative week 6. While preoperative FAR strongly correlated with postoperative week 2 values (r = 0.74), there was a weak positive correlation between age-adjusted CCI and pre-operative FAR (r = 0.24) in patients undergoing primary TKA. Conclusion Albumin levels follow a predictable postoperative decline that inversely correlates with CRP in healthy patients following TKA. Given the low cost and abundance of laboratories offering albumin levels, direct albumin levels and/or albumin ratios such as FAR may be underutilized biomarkers for monitoring the APR following TKA."

In this study, we estimated the BRN 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after societal lockdown of Denmark during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. Method We implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI). Results We were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92–0.98) at day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92–0.93) at day 28. We estimated the BRN prior to lockdown to be 3.32 (95% PI: 3.31–3.33). The effect of the lockdown was occurring over a period of a few days centred at March 18th (95% PI: 17th-18th) 2020. Conclusion We believe our model provides a valuable tool for decision makers to reliably estimate the effect of a politically determined lockdown during an epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W3130904866,"Vehicle ownership modeling and prediction is a crucial task in the transportation planning processes which, traditionally, uses statistical models in the modeling process. However, with the advancement in computing power of computers and Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are becoming an alternative or a complement to the statistical models in modeling the transportation planning processes. Although the application of ML algorithms to the transportation planning processes—like mode choice, and traffic forecasting and demand modeling—have received much attention in research and abound in literature, scanty attention is paid to its application to vehicle ownership modeling especially in the context of small to medium cities in developing countries. Therefore, this study attempts to fill this gap by modeling vehicle ownership in the Greater Tamale Area (GTA), a typically small to medium city in Ghana. Using a cross sectional survey of formal sectors workers, data was collected between June–August 2018. The study applied nine different ML classification algorithms to the dataset using 10-fold cross-validation technique/s and the Cohen-Kappa static/statistic to evaluate the predictive performance of each of the algorithms, and the Permutation Feature Importance to examine the features that contribute significantly to the prediction of vehicle ownership in GTA. The results showed that Linear Support Vector Classification (LinearSVC) classifier performed well in comparison with the other classifiers with regards to the overall predictive ability of the classifiers. In terms of class predictions, K- Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier performs well for no-vehicle class whiles Linear Support Vector Classification (LinearSVC) and GaussianNB classifiers performs well for motorcycle ownership. LinearSVC and Logistic Regression classifiers performed well on the car ownership class. Also, the results indicated that travel mode choice, average monthly income, average travel distance to workplace, average monthly expenditure on transport, duration of travel to workplace, occupational rank, age, household size and marital status were significant in predicting vehicle ownership for most of the classifiers. These findings could help policies makers carve out strategies that would reduce vehicle ownership but improve personal mobility."
https://openalex.org/W3132954521,"Maize with enhanced β-carotene production was engineered to counteract pervasive vitamin A deficiency in developing countries. Second-generation biofortified crops are being developed with additional traits that confer pest resistance. These include crops that can produce Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) insecticidal proteins. Currently, it is unknown whether β-carotene can confer fitness benefits through to insect pests, specifically through altering Ostrinia nubilalis foraging behaviour or development in the presence of Bt insecticidal toxin. Therefore the effects of dietary β-carotene plus Bt insecticidal protein on feeding behaviour, mortality, and physiology in early and late instars of O . nubilalis larvae were investigated. The results of two-choice experiments showed that irrespective of β-carotene presence, at day five 68%-90% of neonates and 69%-77% of fifth-instar larvae avoided diets with Cry1A protein. Over 65% of neonate larvae preferred to feed on diets with β-carotene alone compared to 39% of fifth-instar larvae. Higher mortality (65%-97%) in neonates fed diets supplemented with β-carotene alone and in combination with Bt protein was found, whereas &lt;36% mortality was observed when fed diets without supplemented β-carotene or Bt protein. Diets with both β-carotene and Bt protein extended 25 days the larval developmental duration from neonate to fifth instar (compared to Bt diets) but did not impair larval or pupal weight. Juvenile hormone and 20-hydroxyecdysone regulate insect development and their levels were at least 3-fold higher in larvae fed diets with β-carotene for 3 days. Overall, these results suggest that the effects of β-carotene and Bt protein on O . nubilalis is dependent on larval developmental stage. This study is one of the first that provides insight on how the interaction of novel traits may modulate crop susceptibility to insect pests. This understanding will in turn inform the development of crop protection strategies with greater efficacy."

This was a population-based, cross-sectional study. Diet quality was assessed using the Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I), and knee pain and osteoarthritis were self-reported. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to adjust for age, body mass index, household income, marital status, education, occupation, smoking status, hazardous alcohol use, regular physical activity, menopause, and chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, and depression. A total of 3,881 women were included in this study, and the prevalence of knee pain was 25.4%. The intakes of total energy, protein, and fat were lower in women with knee pain than in those without (all P &lt; 0.01), while the carbohydrate intake was higher (P = 0.01). No significant differences were noted in the scores for variety, overall balance, and moderation components, except for the item of total fat intake, between the DQI-I scores for women with and without knee pain, after adjusting for age. Women without knee pain showed higher scores in several items of the adequacy component (P &lt; 0.05) than did women with knee pain. The total DQI-I scores were lower in women with knee pain than in women without knee pain, after adjusting for covariates, including osteoarthritis (OR = 0.985, 95% CI = 0.973–0.997, P = 0.01). Knee pain independent of osteoarthritis was associated with poor diet quality in community-dwelling women aged ≥ 50 years."

This study employs focus group discussions and a survey questionnaire to examine the attitudes and practices related to African wild meat consumption in the city of Amsterdam, Netherlands. The Ghanaian community was selected as the object of this study, as it is the largest West African population in the Netherlands and represents an important part of Dutch society. We model our report on a recent US study of the Liberian community of Minneapolis, Minnesota, which allows for the comparison of results between two Western countries. The overall perceived health risk of consuming African wild meat in The Netherlands is low and unlikely to deter consumption. However, local prices for the meat may be prohibitive in some cases. Incentives include health benefits, cultural drivers and a strong preference for the taste of African wild meat over all local meat alternatives. The study calls for further research into the nature of the drivers of demand for African wild meat as well as its public health consequences, in the Netherlands and beyond."

https://openalex.org/W3131379355,"Background With the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWH) are surviving longer and are at risk for developing metabolic abnormalities that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there is a paucity of epidemiological data on lipid profiles among young adults receiving ART. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), a cardioprotective lipid class, and whether it differed by age among adults on ART in Livingstone, Zambia. Methods From April to December 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 597 PLWH [n = 58 aged 18–24 years (young adults); n = 539 aged ≥25 years (adults)] on ART for ≥6 months. Data collected included demographic and lifestyle information, anthropometrics, viral load (VL), CD4 count, blood pressure, lipid profiles and fasting/random blood glucose. Clinical measures were defined as: low HDL-c [&lt;1.0 mmol/L for men, &lt;1.3 for women], increased waist circumference (WC) [≥94 cm for men, ≥80 cm for women], high triglycerides (TG) [≥1.7 mmol/l], and virological failure (VF) [VL ≥1000 copies/μl]. We used logistic regression to examine the association between age and low HDL-c after adjusting for multiple variables. Results Among the young adults, 60% (35/58) were women, median (25 th , 75 th percentile) age 21 years (18, 23), and median time on ART 116 months (60, 144). Among adults, 63% (342/539) were women, median age 46 years (40, 53) and median time on ART 108 months (60, 144). Young adults had a lower CD4 count compared to adults (median, 492 vs. 568 cells/μL, p = 0.010) and higher prevalence of VF (29% vs. 17%, p = 0.016). In young adults, prevalence of low HDL-c was significantly higher than in adults (63 vs. 38%, p&lt;0.001). A high proportion of young adults (75%) and adults (58%) with low HDL-c were on dolutegravir (DTG)-based ART regimens. After adjusting for sex, duration on ART, WC, body mass index, ART regimen, VF, CD4 count, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking, young adults were significantly more likely than adults to have low HDL-c (odds ratio 2.93; 95% confidence interval 1.46–5.86). Conclusion Low HDL-c is highly prevalent among young adult with HIV in SSA independent of other risk factors for metabolic derangements. Lipid abnormalities among young PLWH may contribute to the early development of cardiovascular diseases in this population. This highlights the need to consider low HDL-c in the quest to reduce CVD risk among young adults on ART in SSA."

https://openalex.org/W3129506856,"Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) is the specific carrier of circulating glucocorticoids, but evidence suggests that it also plays an active role in modulating tissue glucocorticoid activity. CBG polymorphisms affecting its expression or affinity for glucocorticoids are associated with chronic pain, chronic fatigue, headaches, depression, hypotension, and obesity with an altered hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. CBG has been localized in hippocampus of humans and rodents, a brain area where glucocorticoids have an important regulatory role. However, the specific CBG function in the hippocampus is yet to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the absence of CBG on hippocampal glucocorticoid levels and determine whether pathways regulated by glucocorticoids would be altered. We used cbg -/- mice, which display low total-corticosterone and high free-corticosterone blood levels at the nadir of corticosterone secretion (morning) and at rest to evaluate the hippocampus for total- and free-corticosterone levels; 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase expression and activity; the expression of key proteins involved in glucocorticoid activity and insulin signaling; microtubule-associated protein tau phosphorylation, and neuronal and synaptic function markers. Our results revealed that at the nadir of corticosterone secretion in the resting state the cbg -/- mouse hippocampus exhibited slightly elevated levels of free-corticosterone, diminished FK506 binding protein 5 expression, increased corticosterone downstream effectors and altered MAPK and PI3K pathway with increased pY216-GSK3β and phosphorylated tau. Taken together, these results indicate that CBG deficiency triggers metabolic imbalance which could lead to damage and long-term neurological pathologies."

https://openalex.org/W3132517026,"Precision agriculture (PA) is the application of management decisions based on identifying, quantifying, and responding to space-time variability. However, knowledge of crop pest responses to within-field environmental variability, and the spatial distribution of their natural enemies, is limited. Quantitative methods providing insights on how pest-predator relationships vary within fields are potentially important tools. In this study, phloem feeders and their natural enemies, were observed over two years across 81 locations within a field of the perennial feedstock grass in Georgia, USA. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used to spatially correlate their abundance with environmental factors. Variables included distance to forest edge, Normalized Difference of Vegetation Index (NDVI), slope, aspect, elevation, soil particle size distribution, and weather values. GWR methods were compared with generalized linear regression methods that do not account for spatial information. Non-spatial models indicated positive relationships between phloem-feeder abundance and wind speed, but negative relationships between elevation, proportions of silt and sand, and NDVI. With data partitioned into three seasonal groups, terrain and soil variables remained significant, and natural enemies and spiders became relevant. Results from GWR indicated that magnitudes and directions of responses varied within the field, and that relationships differed among seasons. Strong negative relationships between response and explanatory factors occurred: with NDVI during mid-season; with percent silt, during mid-, and late seasons; and with spider abundance during early and late seasons. In GWR models, slope, elevation, and aspect were mostly positive indicating further that associations with elevation depended on whether models incorporated spatial information or not. By using spatially explicit models, the analysis provided a complex, nuanced understanding of within-field relationships between phloem feeders and environmental covariates. This approach provides an opportunity to learn about the variability within agricultural fields and, with further analysis, has potential to inform and improve PA and habitat management decisions."

Incidence of RR/MDR-TB in Canada is low and treatment practices are variable due to the infrequent experience and challenges with drug access. We undertook a retrospective cohort study of all RR/MDR-TB cases in Alberta, Canada from 2007–2017 to explore the epidemiology and outcomes in our low incidence setting. We performed a descriptive analysis of the epidemiology, treatment regimens and associated outcomes, calculating differences in continuous and discrete variables using Student’s t and Chi-squared tests, respectively. We identified 24 patients with RR/MDR-TB. All patients were foreign-born with the median time to presentation after immigration being 3 years. Prior treatment was reported in 46%. Treatment was individualized. All patients achieved sputum culture conversion within two months of treatment initiation. The median treatment duration after culture conversion was 18 months (IQR: 15–19). The mean number of drugs utilized during the intensive phase was 4.3 (SD: 0.8) and during the continuation phase was 3.3 (SD: 0.9) and the mean adherence to medications was 95%. Six patients completed national guideline-concordant therapy, with many patients developing adverse events (79%). Treatment success (defined as completion of prescribed therapy or cure ) was achieved in 23/24 patients and no acquired drug resistance or relapse was detected over 1.8 years of median follow-up. Many cases were captured upon immigration assessment, representing important prevention of community spread. Despite high rates of adverse events and short treatment compared to international guidelines, success in our cohort was very high at 96%. This is likely due to individualization of therapy, frequent use of medications with high effectiveness, intensive treatment support, and early sputum conversion seen in our cohort. There should be ongoing exploration of treatment shortening with well-tolerated, efficacious oral agents to help patients achieve treatment completion."

To allow the better clinical management and reduce mortality, we searched for clinical and molecular markers that are reliable predictor of disease severity and clinical outcome in ACC patients. We determined a correlation between the overexpression of IL-13R α2 and the clinical outcome in ACC patients using comprehensive data available in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The dataset of 79 ACC subjects were divided into groups of low, medium, or high expression of IL-13R α2 as determined by RNA-seq. These patients were also stratified by length of survival, overall survival, incidence of a new tumor event, incidence of metastasis, and production of excess hormones. We report a correlation between IL-13R α2 expression and survival of subjects with ACC. High expression of IL-13Rα 2 in ACC tumors was significantly associated with a lower patient survival rate and period of survival compared to low expression (p = 0.0084). In addition, high IL-13R α2 expression was significantly associated with a higher incidence of new tumor events and excess hormone production compared to low or medium IL-13R α2 expression. Within the cohort of patients that produced excess hormone, elevated IL-13R α2 expression was significantly associated with a lower survival rate. Additionally, IL-13R α1 had a potential relationship between transcript level and ACC survival. Our results and promising antitumor activity in preclinical models and trials indicate that IL-13R α2 expression is an important prognostic biomarker of ACC disease outcome and a promising target for therapeutic treatment of ACC."

EULAR CSA score is fairly valid in assessing imminent RA in primary hypothyroidism. Conclusion Lower DHEAS predicts clinical features of imminent RA in subjects with primary hypothyroidism. This is akin to low DHEAS seen in many rheumatological disease with possibly similar mechanism. Another possibility is low DHEAS alters hepato-hypothalamo pituitary adrenal axis in presense of cytokines and induces a hitherto unrecognized state of pre rheumatoid arthritis like syndrome. Future studies on primary hypothyroidism should focus on role of lower DHEAS levels in inducing symptoms of fatigue and joint pains."

In consensually non-monogamous (CNM) relationships, needs are dispersed among multiple partners. Using Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and dyadic data from 56 CNM partnerships (112 individuals), we tested how sexual motives and need fulfillment were linked to relational outcomes. We drew from models of need fulfillment to explore how sexual motives with a second partner were associated with satisfaction in the primary relationship. In a cross-sectional and daily experience study we demonstrated that self-determined reasons for sex were positively associated with sexual satisfaction and indirectly linked through sexual need fulfillment. Self-determined reasons for sex predicted need fulfillment for both partners at a three-month follow up. The association between sexual motives and need fulfillment was stronger on days when participants engaged in sex with an additional partner, though this was not related to satisfaction in the primary relationship. Implications for need fulfillment are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3132957625,"Background Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is implicated in the development of hypothalamic obesity. We investigated the relationship between hypothalamic involvement (HI), central obesity, and cardiac autonomic dysfunction by assessing heart rate variability (HRV) indices in patients with childhood-onset craniopharyngioma. Methods A cross-sectional study of 48 patients (28 males, 10–30 years old) with hypothalamic damage after childhood-onset craniopharyngioma was performed. Postoperative HI was graded as mild (n = 19) or extensive (n = 29) on magnetic resonance imaging. Anthropometry, body composition and HRV indices including the standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN) and total power (TP) as overall variability markers, root-mean square differences of successive R-R intervals (RMSSD) and high frequency (HF) as parasympathetic modulation markers, and low frequency (LF) as a sympathetic/sympathovagal modulation marker were measured. Results Patients with extensive HI had increased means of body mass index, waist circumference, and fat mass than those with mild HI ( P &lt; 0.05, for all). Centrally obese patients had a lower mean HF, a parasympathetic modulation marker, than centrally non-obese patients ( P &lt; 0.05). The extensive HI group had lower means of overall variability (SDNN and TP), parasympathetic modulation (HF), and sympathetic/sympathovagal modulation (LF) than the mild HI group ( P &lt; 0.05, for all). The interaction effect of HI and central obesity on HRV indices was not significant. In models adjusted for age, sex, and family history of cardiometabolic disease, the means of the overall variability indices ( P &lt; 0.05 for both SDNN and TP) and a sympathetic/sympathovagal modulation index ( P &lt; 0.05 for LF) were lower with extensive HI, without differences according to central obesity. Conclusions The reduced HRV indices with extensive HI suggests that hypothalamic damage may contribute to cardiac autonomic dysfunction, underscoring the importance of minimizing hypothalamic damage in patients with childhood-onset craniopharyngioma."
https://openalex.org/W3133098185,"Reports of invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae have declined since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7 and PCV13). The incidence of invasive diseases due to S . pneumoniae that are not addressed by the vaccines, however, has increased in children and adults, creating a global public health problem. Previously, we established the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for a PCV13 serotype-specific assay. In the current study, we developed a rapid, simple, and cost-effective assay to detect serotypes in the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) using the LAMP method. In this study, LAMP primer sets for serotypes 2, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 17F, 20, 22F, and 33F of S . pneumoniae were developed. The reactivity, specificity, and sensitivity of LAMP assays were determined and compared to those of conventional PCR. The feasibility of LAMP assays in clinical application in patients with invasive pneumococcal diseases was validated by defining the detection limit of the LAMP assay with bacterial genomic DNA-spiked blood specimens. The specificity of each LAMP assay was determined using 44 serotypes of pneumococcal strains. Their sensitivity was 100 copies per reaction versus 10 3 to 10 6 copies per reaction for PCR assays. Using DNA-spiked blood specimens, excluding the LAMP assay that targeted serotype 22F (10 3 copies per reaction), the limit of detection of the LAMP assay was similar to that with purified DNA as the template (10 2 copies per reaction), compared with 10 3 to &gt;10 6 copies per reaction for PCR assays. In conclusion, a rapid and simple LAMP-based PPSV23-targeted serotype detection assay was developed for use in many countries. This study is the first report of a LAMP-based assay for identification of PPSV23 serotypes. Further evaluation of this assay is needed through surveillance and vaccine efficacy studies."
https://openalex.org/W3129598467,"Introduction Study aims were to compare hemodynamics and viscous energy dissipation (VED) in 3D printed mitral valves–one replicating a normal valve and the other a valve with severe mitral annular calcification (MAC). Patients with severe MAC develop transmitral gradients, without the commissural fusion typifying rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), and may have symptoms similar to classical MS. A proposed mechanism relates to VED due to disturbed blood flow through the diseased valve into the ventricle. Methods A silicone model of a normal mitral valve (MV) was created using a transesophageal echocardiography dataset. 3D printed calcium phantoms were incorporated into a second valve model to replicate severe MAC. The synthetic MVs were tested in a left heart duplicator under rest and exercise conditions. Fine particles were suspended in a water/glycerol blood analogue for particle image velocimetry calculation of VED. Results Catheter mean transmitral gradients were slightly higher in the MAC valve compared to the normal MV, both at rest (3.2 vs. 1.3 mm Hg) and with exercise (5.9 vs. 5.0 mm Hg); Doppler gradients were 2.7 vs. 2.1 mm Hg at rest and 9.9 vs 8.2 mm Hg with exercise. VED was similar between the two valves at rest. During exercise, VED increased to a greater extent for the MAC valve (240%) versus the normal valve (127%). Conclusion MAC MS is associated with slightly increased transmitral gradients but markedly increased VED during exercise. These energy losses may contribute to the exercise intolerance and exertional dyspnea present in MAC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3131309942,"Lung function abnormalities are ubiquitous in heart failure (HF). It is unclear, however, if abnormal lung diffusion capacity is associated with cardiac remodeling and antedates HF. We hypothesized that lower lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is associated with worse left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function cross-sectionally, and with higher risk of HF prospectively.We evaluated 2423 Framingham Study participants (mean age 66 years, 55% women) free of HF who underwent routine echocardiography and pulmonary function tests. We used multivariable regression models to relate DLCO, forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial (LA) emptying fraction (LAEF), E/e', E/A, LV mass, and LA diameter (LAD). Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to relate DLCO, FEV1, and FVC to incident HF.In multivariable-adjusted cross-sectional analyses, DLCO, FEV1, and FVC (dependent variables) were associated positively with LVEF (βDLCO = 0.208, βFEV1 = 0.021, and βFVC = 0.025 per 5% increment in LVEF; p<0.005 for all), and LAEF (βDLCO = 0.707, βFEV1 = 0.058 and βFVC = 0.058 per 5% increment in LAEF; p<0.002 for all). DLCO and FVC were inversely related to E/A (βDLCO = -0.289, βFVC = -0.047 per SD increment in E/A; p<0.001 for all). Additionally, DLCO, FEV1 and FVC were inversely related to HF risk (108 events, median follow-up 9.7 years; multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios per SD increment 0.90, 95% CI 0.86-0.95; 0.42, 95% CI 0.28-0.65, and 0.51, 95% CI 0.36-0.73, respectively). These results remained robust in analyses restricted to non-smokers.Our large community-based observations are consistent with the concept that lower lung diffusion capacity and expiratory flow rates are associated with cardiac remodeling and may antedate HF. Additional studies are needed to confirm our findings and to evaluate the prognostic utility of pulmonary function testing for predicting HF."
https://openalex.org/W3132941454,"Respiratory failure is a common condition faced by critically ill neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is often used for neonates with refractory respiratory failure related to RDS. Volume guarantee (VG) mode has been added to some HFOV ventilators for providing consistent tidal volume. We sought to examine the impact of adding the VG mode during HFOV on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics, which has not been studied to date. A neonatal piglet model of moderate to severe RDS was induced by saline lavage. Piglets (full term, age 1–3 days, weight 1.5–2.4 kg) were randomized to have RDS induced and receive either HFOV or HFOV+VG (n = 8/group) or sham-operation (n = 6) without RDS. Cardiac function measured by a Millar ® catheter placed in the left ventricle as well as systemic and carotid hemodynamic and oxygen tissue saturation parameters were collected over 240 min of ventilation. Mean airway pressure, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference and left ventricular cardiac index of piglets on HFOV vs. HFOV+VG were not significantly different during the experimental period. Right common carotid artery flow index by in-situ ultrasonic flow measurement and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (near-infrared spectroscopy) significantly decreased in HFOV+VG at 240 min compared to HFOV (14 vs. 31 ml/kg/min, and 30% vs. 43%, respectively; p&lt;0.05). There were no significant differences in lung, brain and heart tissue markers of oxidative stress, ischemia and inflammation. HFOV+VG compared to HFOV was associated with similar left ventricular function, however HFOV+VG had a negative effect on cerebral blood flow and oxygenation."
