https://openalex.org/W1770278459,"Febrile seizures are the most common type of developmental seizures, affecting up to 5% of children. Experimental complex febrile seizures involving the immature rat hippocampus led to a persistent lowering of seizure threshold despite an upregulation of inhibition. Here we provide a mechanistic resolution to this paradox by showing that, in the hippocampus of rats that had febrile seizures, the long-lasting enhancement of the widely expressed intrinsic membrane conductance Ih converts the potentiated synaptic inhibition to hyperexcitability in a frequency-dependent manner. The altered gain of this molecular inhibition-excitation converter reveals a new mechanism for controlling the balance of excitation-inhibition in the limbic system. In addition, here we show for the first time that h-channels are modified in a human neurological disease paradigm."

https://openalex.org/W1936592935,"The glaucomas are a group of optic neuropathies comprising the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Elevated intraocular pressure due to a reduction in normal aqueous outflow is a major causal risk factor. We found that endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), the earliest marker for the atherosclerotic plaque in the vasculature, was consistently present on trabecular meshwork (TM) cells in the outflow pathways of eyes with glaucomas of diverse etiology. We determined expression of ELAM-1 to be controlled by activation of an interleukin-1 (IL-1) autocrine feedback loop through transcription factor NF-kappaB, and activity of this signaling pathway was shown to protect TM cells against oxidative stress. These findings characterize a protective stress response specific to the eye's aqueous outflow pathways and provide the first known diagnostic indicator of glaucomatous TM cells. They further indicate that common mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology of the glaucomas and vascular diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1588846002,"Here we show that plasma kallikrein (PKal) mediates a plasminogen (Plg) cascade in adipocyte differentiation. Ecotin, an inhibitor of serine proteases, inhibits cell-shape change, adipocyte-specific gene expression, and lipid accumulation during adipogenesis in culture. Deficiency of Plg, but not of urokinase or tissue-type plasminogen activator, suppresses adipogenesis during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and mammary-gland involution. PKal, which is inhibited by ecotin, is required for adipose conversion, Plg activation and 3T3-L1 differentiation. Human plasma lacking PKal does not support differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. PKal is therefore a physiological regulator that acts in the Plg cascade during adipogenesis. We propose that the Plg cascade fosters adipocyte differentiation by degradation of the fibronectin-rich preadipocyte stromal matrix."
