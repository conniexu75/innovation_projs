https://openalex.org/W2890865075,"Cellular senescence, which is characterized by an irreversible cell-cycle arrest1 accompanied by a distinctive secretory phenotype2, can be induced through various intracellular and extracellular factors. Senescent cells that express the cell cycle inhibitory protein p16INK4A have been found to actively drive naturally occurring age-related tissue deterioration3,4 and contribute to several diseases associated with ageing, including atherosclerosis5 and osteoarthritis6. Various markers of senescence have been observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases7-9; however, a role for senescent cells in the aetiology of these pathologies is unknown. Here we show a causal link between the accumulation of senescent cells and cognition-associated neuronal loss. We found that the MAPTP301SPS19 mouse model of tau-dependent neurodegenerative disease10 accumulates p16INK4A-positive senescent astrocytes and microglia. Clearance of these cells as they arise using INK-ATTAC transgenic mice prevents gliosis, hyperphosphorylation of both soluble and insoluble tau leading to neurofibrillary tangle deposition, and degeneration of cortical and hippocampal neurons, thus preserving cognitive function. Pharmacological intervention with a first-generation senolytic modulates tau aggregation. Collectively, these results show that senescent cells have a role in the initiation and progression of tau-mediated disease, and suggest that targeting senescent cells may provide a therapeutic avenue for the treatment of these pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2890140563,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of mRNA is emerging as an important regulator of gene expression that affects different developmental and biological processes, and altered m6A homeostasis is linked to cancer1–5. m6A modification is catalysed by METTL3 and enriched in the 3′ untranslated region of a large subset of mRNAs at sites close to the stop codon5. METTL3 can promote translation but the mechanism and relevance of this process remain unknown1. Here we show that METTL3 enhances translation only when tethered to reporter mRNA at sites close to the stop codon, supporting a mechanism of mRNA looping for ribosome recycling and translational control. Electron microscopy reveals the topology of individual polyribosomes with single METTL3 foci in close proximity to 5′ cap-binding proteins. We identify a direct physical and functional interaction between METTL3 and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit h (eIF3h). METTL3 promotes translation of a large subset of oncogenic mRNAs—including bromodomain-containing protein 4—that is also m6A-modified in human primary lung tumours. The METTL3–eIF3h interaction is required for enhanced translation, formation of densely packed polyribosomes and oncogenic transformation. METTL3 depletion inhibits tumorigenicity and sensitizes lung cancer cells to BRD4 inhibition. These findings uncover a mechanism of translation control that is based on mRNA looping and identify METTL3–eIF3h as a potential therapeutic target for patients with cancer. METTL3, the enzyme responsible for m6A modification, influences translation by interacting with eIF3h to mediate looping between the regions near the stop codon and 5′ cap of mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2890840461,"The evolution of the Milky Way disk, which contains most of the stars in the Galaxy, is affected by several phenomena. For example, the bar and the spiral arms of the Milky Way induce radial migration of stars1 and can trap or scatter stars close to orbital resonances2. External perturbations from satellite galaxies can also have a role, causing dynamical heating of the Galaxy3, ring-like structures in the disk4 and correlations between different components of the stellar velocity5. These perturbations can also cause ‘phase wrapping’ signatures in the disk6–9, such as arched velocity structures in the motions of stars in the Galactic plane. Some manifestations of these dynamical processes have already been detected, including kinematic substructure in samples of nearby stars10–12, density asymmetries and velocities across the Galactic disk that differ from the axisymmetric and equilibrium expectations13, especially in the vertical direction11,14–16, and signatures of incomplete phase mixing in the disk7,12,17,18. Here we report an analysis of the motions of six million stars in the Milky Way disk. We show that the phase-space distribution contains different substructures with various morphologies, such as snail shells and ridges, when spatial and velocity coordinates are combined. We infer that the disk must have been perturbed between 300 million and 900 million years ago, consistent with estimates of the previous pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Our findings show that the Galactic disk is dynamically young and that modelling it as time-independent and axisymmetric is incorrect. An analysis of the motions of six million stars in the Milky Way disk reveals substructures such as snail shells and ridges, indicating that our Galaxy has been recently perturbed."
https://openalex.org/W2892299358,"Plants influence the atmosphere through fluxes of carbon, water and energy1, and can intensify drought through land–atmosphere feedback effects2–4. The diversity of plant functional traits in forests, especially physiological traits related to water (hydraulic) transport, may have a critical role in land–atmosphere feedback, particularly during drought. Here we combine 352 site-years of eddy covariance measurements from 40 forest sites, remote-sensing observations of plant water content and plant functional-trait data to test whether the diversity in plant traits affects the response of the ecosystem to drought. We find evidence that higher hydraulic diversity buffers variation in ecosystem flux during dry periods across temperate and boreal forests. Hydraulic traits were the predominant significant predictors of cross-site patterns in drought response. By contrast, standard leaf and wood traits, such as specific leaf area and wood density, had little explanatory power. Our results demonstrate that diversity in the hydraulic traits of trees mediates ecosystem resilience to drought and is likely to have an important role in future ecosystem–atmosphere feedback effects in a changing climate. The diversity in the hydraulic traits of trees mediates ecosystem resilience to drought and will probably have an important role in future ecosystem–atmosphere feedback effects."

https://openalex.org/W2952728370,"Defects in the architecture or integrity of the nuclear envelope are associated with a variety of human diseases1. Micronuclei, one common nuclear aberration, are an origin for chromothripsis2, a catastrophic mutational process that is commonly observed in cancer3-5. Chromothripsis occurs after micronuclei spontaneously lose nuclear envelope integrity, which generates chromosome fragmentation6. Disruption of the nuclear envelope exposes DNA to the cytoplasm and initiates innate immune proinflammatory signalling7. Despite its importance, the basis of the fragility of the micronucleus nuclear envelope is not known. Here we show that micronuclei undergo defective nuclear envelope assembly. Only 'core' nuclear envelope proteins8,9 assemble efficiently on lagging chromosomes, whereas 'non-core' nuclear envelope proteins8,9, including nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), do not. Consequently, micronuclei fail to properly import key proteins that are necessary for the integrity of the nuclear envelope and genome. We show that spindle microtubules block assembly of NPCs and other non-core nuclear envelope proteins on lagging chromosomes, causing an irreversible defect in nuclear envelope assembly. Accordingly, experimental manipulations that position missegregated chromosomes away from the spindle correct defective nuclear envelope assembly, prevent spontaneous nuclear envelope disruption, and suppress DNA damage in micronuclei. Thus, during mitotic exit in metazoan cells, chromosome segregation and nuclear envelope assembly are only loosely coordinated by the timing of mitotic spindle disassembly. The absence of precise checkpoint controls may explain why errors during mitotic exit are frequent and often trigger catastrophic genome rearrangements4,5."

https://openalex.org/W2891423421,"Soaring birds often rely on ascending thermal plumes (thermals) in the atmosphere as they search for prey or migrate across large distances1-4. The landscape of convective currents is rugged and shifts on timescales of a few minutes as thermals constantly form, disintegrate or are transported away by the wind5,6. How soaring birds find and navigate thermals within this complex landscape is unknown. Reinforcement learning7 provides an appropriate framework in which to identify an effective navigational strategy as a sequence of decisions made in response to environmental cues. Here we use reinforcement learning to train a glider in the field to navigate atmospheric thermals autonomously. We equipped a glider of two-metre wingspan with a flight controller that precisely controlled the bank angle and pitch, modulating these at intervals with the aim of gaining as much lift as possible. A navigational strategy was determined solely from the glider's pooled experiences, collected over several days in the field. The strategy relies on on-board methods to accurately estimate the local vertical wind accelerations and the roll-wise torques on the glider, which serve as navigational cues. We establish the validity of our learned flight policy through field experiments, numerical simulations and estimates of the noise in measurements caused by atmospheric turbulence. Our results highlight the role of vertical wind accelerations and roll-wise torques as effective mechanosensory cues for soaring birds and provide a navigational strategy that is directly applicable to the development of autonomous soaring vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W2950684512,"The CRISPR system provides adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements in prokaryotes, using small CRISPR RNAs that direct effector complexes to degrade invading nucleic acids1–3. Type III effector complexes were recently demonstrated to synthesize a novel second messenger, cyclic oligoadenylate, on binding target RNA4,5. Cyclic oligoadenylate, in turn, binds to and activates ribonucleases and other factors—via a CRISPR-associated Rossman-fold domain—and thereby induces in the cell an antiviral state that is important for immunity. The mechanism of the ‘off-switch’ that resets the system is not understood. Here we identify the nuclease that degrades these cyclic oligoadenylate ring molecules. This ‘ring nuclease’ is itself a protein of the CRISPR-associated Rossman-fold family, and has a metal-independent mechanism that cleaves cyclic tetraadenylate rings to generate linear diadenylate species and switches off the antiviral state. The identification of ring nucleases adds an important insight to the CRISPR system. In the CRISPR type III system, ‘ring’ nucleases possess a metal-independent mechanism that cleaves cyclic oligoadenylate ring molecules to switch off the antiviral state in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2890567288,"Photoemission spectroscopy is central to understanding the inner workings of condensed matter, from simple metals and semiconductors to complex materials such as Mott insulators and superconductors1. Most state-of-the-art knowledge about such solids stems from spectroscopic investigations, and use of subfemtosecond light pulses can provide a time-domain perspective. For example, attosecond (10-18 seconds) metrology allows electron wave packet creation, transport and scattering to be followed on atomic length scales and on attosecond timescales2-7. However, previous studies could not disclose the duration of these processes, because the arrival time of the photons was not known with attosecond precision. Here we show that this main source of ambiguity can be overcome by introducing the atomic chronoscope method, which references all measured timings to the moment of light-pulse arrival and therefore provides absolute timing of the processes under scrutiny. Our proof-of-principle experiment reveals that photoemission from the tungsten conduction band can proceed faster than previously anticipated. By contrast, the duration of electron emanation from core states is correctly described by semiclassical modelling. These findings highlight the necessity of treating the origin, initial excitation and transport of electrons in advanced modelling of the attosecond response of solids, and our absolute data provide a benchmark. Starting from a robustly characterized surface, we then extend attosecond spectroscopy towards isolating the emission properties of atomic adsorbates on surfaces and demonstrate that these act as photoemitters with instantaneous response. We also find that the tungsten core-electron timing remains unchanged by the adsorption of less than one monolayer of dielectric atoms, providing a starting point for the exploration of excitation and charge migration in technologically and biologically relevant adsorbate systems."
https://openalex.org/W2892077999,"Social network analysis (SNA) may be of significant value in studying online collaborative learning. SNA can enhance our understanding of the collaborative process, predict the under-achievers by means of learning analytics, and uncover the role dynamics of learners and teachers alike. As such, it constitutes an obvious opportunity to improve learning, inform teachers and stakeholders. Besides, it can facilitate data-driven support services for students. This study included four courses at Qassim University. Online interaction data were collected and processed following a standard data mining technique. The SNA parameters relevant to knowledge sharing and construction were calculated on the individual and the group level. The analysis included quantitative network analysis and visualization, correlation tests as well as predictive and explanatory regression models. Our results showed a consistent moderate to strong positive correlation between performance, interaction parameters and students’ centrality measures across all the studied courses, regardless of the subject matter. In each of the studied courses, students with stronger ties to prominent peers (better social capital) in small interactive and cohesive groups tended to do better. The results of correlation tests were confirmed using regression tests, which were validated using a next year dataset. Using SNA indicators, we were able to classify students according to achievement with high accuracy (93.3%). This demonstrates the possibility of using interaction data to predict underachievers with reasonable reliability, which is an obvious opportunity for intervention and support."

https://openalex.org/W2891719237,"In vertebrate cells, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) leads to Ca2+-mediated stimulation of an intramitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP). This enzyme dephosphorylates serine residues in the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), thereby activating PDH and resulting in increased ATP production. Although a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle for the E1α subunit of PDH from nonvertebrate organisms has been described, the Ca2+-mediated PDP activation has not been studied. In this work, we investigated the Ca2+ sensitivity of two recombinant PDPs from the protozoan human parasites Trypanosoma cruzi (TcPDP) and T. brucei (TbPDP) and generated a TcPDP-KO cell line to establish TcPDP’s role in cell bioenergetics and survival. Moreover, the mitochondrial localization of the TcPDP was studied by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated endogenous tagging. Our results indicate that TcPDP and TbPDP both are Ca2+-sensitive phosphatases. Of note, TcPDP-KO epimastigotes exhibited increased levels of phosphorylated TcPDH, slower growth and lower oxygen consumption rates than control cells, an increased AMP/ATP ratio and autophagy under starvation conditions, and reduced differentiation into infective metacyclic forms. Furthermore, TcPDP-KO trypomastigotes were impaired in infecting cultured host cells. We conclude that TcPDP is a Ca2+-stimulated mitochondrial phosphatase that dephosphorylates TcPDH and is required for normal growth, differentiation, infectivity, and energy metabolism in T. cruzi. Our results support the view that one of the main roles of the MCU is linked to the regulation of intramitochondrial dehydrogenases.

https://openalex.org/W2889842316,"Global agriculture is under pressure to meet increasing demand for food and agricultural products. There are several global assessments of crop yields, but we know little about the uncertainties of their key findings, as the assessments are driven by the single best yield dataset available when each assessment was conducted. Recently, two different spatially explicit, global, historical yield datasets, one based on agricultural census and the other largely based on satellite remote sensing, became available. Using these datasets, we compare the similarities and differences in global yield gaps, trend patterns, growth rates and changes in year-to-year variability. We analyzed maize, rice, wheat and soybean for the period of 1981 to 2008 at four resolutions (0.083°, 0.5°, 1.0° and 2.0°). Although estimates varied by dataset and resolution, the global mean annual growth rates of 1.7–1.8%, 1.5–1.7%, 1.1–1.3% and 1.4–1.6% for maize, rice, wheat and soybean, respectively, are not on track to double crop production by 2050. Potential production increases that can be attributed to closing yield gaps estimated from the satellite-based dataset are almost twice those estimated from the census-based dataset. Detected yield variability changes in rice and wheat are sensitive to the choice of dataset and resolution, but they are relatively robust for maize and soybean. Estimates of yield gaps and variability changes are more uncertain than those of yield trend patterns and growth rates. These tendencies are consistent across crops. Efforts to reduce uncertainties are required to gain a better understanding of historical change and crop production potential to better inform agricultural policies and investments."

https://openalex.org/W2952532583,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of long-term survival in water, which may serve as a reservoir for infection. Although viable cell counts of PAO1 incubated in water remain stable throughout 8 weeks, LIVE/DEAD staining indicated a high proportion of cells stained with propidium iodide (PI). The proportion of PI-stained cells increased by 4 weeks, then decreased again by 8 weeks, suggesting an adaptive response. This was also evident in an observed shift in cell morphology from a rod to a coccoid shape after 8 weeks. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to recover PI-stained cells, which were plated and shown to be viable, indicating that PI-stained cells were membrane-compromised but still cultivable. PAO1 mid-log cells in water were labeled with the dsDNA-binding dye PicoGreen to monitor viability as well as DNA integrity, which demonstrated that the population remains viable and transitions towards increased dsDNA staining. Metabolic activity was found to decrease significantly in water by 4 weeks. The PAO1 outer membrane became less permeable and more resistant to polymyxin B damage in water, and the profile of total membrane lipids changed over time. Among the ~1400 transcriptional lux fusions, gene expression in water revealed that the majority of genes were repressed, but subsets of genes were induced at particular time points. In summary, these results indicate that P. aeruginosa is dormant in water and this adaptation involves a complex pattern of gene regulation and changes to the cell to promote long-term survival and antibiotic tolerance. The approach of P. aeruginosa incubated in water may be useful to study antibiotic tolerance and the mechanisms of dormancy and survival in nutrient limiting conditions."

This article presents DrawingOut, a metaphor-centred drawing workshop designed to collect visual and textual data about individuals' experiences of sensitive or taboo health experiences. The visual data, consisting of the artwork produced by participants, and the textual data, all conversations and discussions occurring during the workshop, can also be used to create engaging outputs for dissemination. We piloted DrawingOut in a study of nine women with a minority ethnic or religious background in Cardiff, UK. The women were invited to participate in a series of structured drawing activities. The conversations occurring during the workshop were recorded and then subjected to thematic analysis. Results showed that women's views and experiences could be grouped in eight major themes covering their wellbeing, relationship with others, and healthcare views and experiences. We produced an A5 16-page booklet that presents the pilot study results, illustrated with participants' own drawings and quotes, which was disseminated among participants, their community and other relevant stakeholders. This pilot study supports the view that healthcare actors can use the DrawingOut method to engage people to talk about sensitive health topics, while simultaneously providing them with an enjoyable and empowering research experience. In our pilot study the DrawingOut was successful in eliciting rich visual and textual data that captures a diversity of views and experiences, with the added benefit that these can be used to produce engaging outputs for dissemination."

Sleep disorder may lead to adverse health outcomes. The effects of sleep deprivation were extensively studied, but its mechanism is still not fully understood. The present study aimed to identify the alterations of serum proteins associated with chronic sleep deprivation, and to seek for potential biomarkers of sleep disorder mediated diseases. A label-free quantitative proteomics technology was used to survey the global changes of serum proteins between normal rats and chronic sleep deprivation rats. A total of 309 proteins were detected in the serum samples and among them, 117 proteins showed more than 1.8-folds abundance alterations between the two groups. Functional enrichment and network analyses of the differential proteins revealed a close relationship between chronic sleep deprivation and several biological processes including energy metabolism, cardiovascular function and nervous function. And four proteins including pyruvate kinase M1, clusterin, kininogen1 and profilin-1were identified as potential biomarkers for chronic sleep deprivation. The four candidates were validated via parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) based targeted proteomics. In addition, protein expression alteration of the four proteins was confirmed in myocardium and brain of rat model. In summary, the comprehensive proteomic study revealed the biological impacts of chronic sleep deprivation and discovered several potential biomarkers. This study provides further insight into the pathological and molecular mechanisms underlying sleep disorders at protein level."
https://openalex.org/W2890697134,"Research utilizing repeated-measures such as daily assessments with self-report and/or objective measures [e.g., physical activity (PA) monitors] are important in understanding health behaviors and informing practice and policy. However, studies that utilize daily assessment often encounter issues with attrition and non-compliance. The current research yielded high levels of retention and adherence with both self-report and objective daily measures. The purpose of this paper is to highlight and discuss strategies utilized in maximizing retention, minimizing missing data, and some lessons learned from the research experience. Fifty community participants took part in a 4-week study utilizing both daily self-report questionnaires and daily use of PA monitors (Fitbit One™). This study focused on typical daily PA and was not an intervention study (e.g., participants were not randomized nor asked to change their PA behavior). Participants completed the study in two waves (wave 1 n = 10, wave 2 n = 40). The research team utilized several retention strategies including automating the data collection process, a prorated incentive structure, having a dedicated and responsive study staff, and utilizing the 2-wave process to optimize data collection during the 2nd wave. The study had 100% retention and generally positive anonymous feedback post-study. Overall, participants completed the vast majority of daily surveys (97%) and wore their Fitbits (for at least part of the day) on almost all days (99.57%) of the study, although there were individual differences. The strategies discussed and lessons learned may be useful to other researchers using daily measurements for whom adherence and retention are important issues. Future research employing these strategies in different populations, with different measurements, and for longer durations is warranted to determine generalizability."

They include a variety of biological features affecting clinical behavior and treatment. Having no guidelines on treatment established, we aim to describe clinical and treatment patterns of low-grade gliomas across the largest cancer database in the United States. Methods We analyzed the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2015, for adult patients with a diagnosis of World Health Organization grade II diffuse glioma. Results We analyzed 13,621 cases with median age of 41 years. Over 56% were male, 88.4% were white, 6.1% were black, and 7.6% Hispanic. The most common primary site location was the cerebrum (79.9%). Overall, 72.2% received surgery, 36.0% radiation, and 27.3% chemotherapy. Treatment combinations included surgery only (41.5%), chemotherapy + surgery (6.6%), chemotherapy only (3.1%), radiation + chemotherapy + surgery (10.7%), radiation + surgery (11.5%), radiation only (6.1%), and radiotherapy + chemotherapy (6.7%). Radiation was more common in treatment of elderly patients, 1p/19q co-deletion (37.3% versus 24.3%, p<0.01), and tumors with midline location. Median survival was 11 years with younger age, 1p/19q co-deletion, and cerebrum location offered survival advantage. Conclusions Tumor location, 1p/19q co-deletion, and age were the main determinants of treatment received and survival, likely reflecting tumor biology differences. Any form of treatment was preferred over watchful waiting in the majority of the patients (86.1% versus 8.1%). Survival of low-grade gliomas is higher than previously reported in the majority of clinical trials and population-based analyses. Our analysis provides a real world estimation of treatment decisions, use of molecular data, and outcomes."

However, comprehensive epidemiological and economic data is lacking in France, especially for rarer potentially HPV-related cancers, which include anal, vulvar and vaginal cancers. Using the national comprehensive database of French public and private hospital information (PMSI), we assessed prevalence and incidence of patients with in-hospital diagnosis for potentially HPV-related cancers in 2013, and estimated costs related to their management over a 3-year period after diagnosis in France. Concerning female genital cancers, 7,597, 1,491 and 748 women were hospitalized for cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancer in 2013, respectively, with 3,120, 522 and 323 of them being new cases. A total of 4,153 patients were hospitalized for anal cancer in 2013, including 1,661 new cases. For HNCs, 8,794 and 14,730 patients were hospitalized for oral and oropharyngeal cancer in 2013, respectively; 3,619 and 6,808 were new cases. Within the 3 years after cancer diagnosis, the average cost of hospital care per patient varied from €28 K for anal cancer to €41 K for oral cancer. Most expenditures were related to hospital care, before outpatient care and disability allowance; they were concentrated in the first year of care. The total economic burden associated with HPV-potentially related cancers was about €511 M for the French National Health Insurance over a 3 years period (2011 to 2013), ranging from €8 M for vaginal cancer to €222 M for oropharyngeal cancer. This study reported the most up-to-date epidemiological and economic data on potentially HPV-related cancers in France.

https://openalex.org/W2889679124,"Most spiders spin multiple types of silk, including silks for reproduction, prey capture, and draglines. Spiders are a megadiverse group and the majority of spider silks remain uncharacterized. For example, nothing is known about the silk molecules of Tengella perfuga, a spider that spins sheet webs lined with cribellar silk. Cribellar silk is a type of adhesive capture thread composed of numerous fibrils that originate from a specialized plate-like spinning organ called the cribellum. The predominant components of spider silks are spidroins, members of a protein family synthesized in silk glands. Here, we use silk gland RNA-Seq and cDNA libraries to infer T. perfuga silks at the protein level. We show that T. perfuga spiders express 13 silk transcripts representing at least five categories of spider silk proteins (spidroins). One category is a candidate for cribellar silk and is thus named cribellar spidroin (CrSp). Studies of ontogenetic changes in web construction and spigot morphology in T. perfuga have documented that after sexual maturation, T. perfuga females continue to make capture webs but males halt web maintenance and cease spinning cribellar silk. Consistent with these observations, our candidate CrSp was expressed only in females. The other four spidroin categories correspond to paralogs of aciniform, ampullate, pyriform, and tubuliform spidroins. These spidroins are associated with egg sac and web construction. Except for the tubuliform spidroin, the spidroins from T. perfuga contain novel combinations of amino acid sequence motifs that have not been observed before in these spidroin types. Characterization of T. perfuga silk genes, particularly CrSp, expand the diversity of the spidroin family and inspire new structure/function hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W2890775708,"Arthropods are the most species-rich taxon within Metazoa and have gone through major evolutionary changes with regard to body organization. Arthropod hearts and their associated vascular systems are thus morphologically highly disparate: while some arthropods exhibit very powerful hearts and complex vascular systems, other arthropods do not possess any kind of vascular system or heart at all. A comprehensive study investigating the structure of arthropods hearts has never been undertaken. In this study, we therefore investigate the hearts of 34 species from all major arthropod groups using various imaging techniques (confocal laser scanning microscopy, micro-computed tomography, histology) and describe them by addressing different aspects of heart morphology, e.g. the structure of the myocard or the composition of ostia. In a next step, we conceptualize 18 characters related to heart morphology and their respective character states and–using additional data from the literature–score a matrix for a total of 45 species from 38 supraspecific taxa. We map the characters onto prevailing phylogenetic hypotheses and perform parsimony-based ancestral state reconstruction to trace the evolutionary transformations undergone by arthropod hearts. An exploration of the character concepts (as explanatory hypotheses) reveals ontological peculiarities of character statements that clearly distinguish them in terms of ontological status from descriptive statements (i.e. descriptions of morphemes). The implications of these findings influence the interpretation of ground patterns as explanations. This first phylogenetic approach to heart morphology in the arthropod ground pattern reveals numerous new putative synapomorphies and leads to a reconsideration of the morphology of circulatory systems in early arthropods. Hypotheses on the evolution of hearts in (Pan-) Arthropoda are illustrated and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2951273371,"It has been recognized that the Merle coat pattern in dogs is not only a visually interesting feature, but it also exerts an important biological role, in terms of hearing and vision impairments. In 2006, the Merle (M) locus was mapped to the SILV gene (aka PMEL) with a SINE element in it, and the inserted retroelement was proven causative to the Merle phenotype. Mapping of the M locus was a genetic breakthrough and many breeders started implementing SILV SINE testing in their breeding programs. Unfortunately, the situation turned out complicated as genotypes of Merle tested individuals did not always correspond to expected phenotypes, sometimes with undesired health consequences in the offspring. Two variants of SILV SINE, allelic to the wild type sequence, have been described so far–Mc and M. Here we report a significantly larger portfolio of existing Merle alleles (Mc, Mc+, Ma, Ma+, M, Mh) in Merle dogs, which are associated with unique coat color features and stratified health impairment risk. The refinement of allelic identification was made possible by systematic, detailed observation of Merle phenotypes in a cohort of 181 dogs from known Merle breeds, by many breeders worldwide, and the use of advanced molecular technology enabling the discrimination of individual Merle alleles with significantly higher precision than previously available. We also show that mosaicism of Merle alleles is an unexpectedly frequent phenomenon, which was identified in 30 out of 181 (16.6%) dogs in our study group. Importantly, not only major alleles, but also minor Merle alleles can be inherited by the offspring. Thus, mosaic findings cannot be neglected and must be reported to the breeder in their whole extent. Most importantly, sperm cells seem to be a significant source of germline Merle allelic variants which can be passed to the offspring on Mendelian basis and explain unusual genotype / phenotype findings in the offspring. In light of negative health consequences that may be attributed to certain Merle breeding strategies, we strongly advocate implementation of the refined Merle allele testing for all dogs of Merle breeds to help the breeders in selection of suitable mating partners and production of healthy offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2891980493,"Adipose tissue is no longer considered a mere energy reserve, but a metabolically and hormonally active organ strongly associated with the regulation of whole-body metabolism. Knowledge of adipose metabolic regulatory function is of great importance in cattle management, as it affects the efficiency and manner with which an animal converts feedstuff to milk, meat and fat. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating metabolism in bovine adipose tissue are still not fully elucidated. The emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies has facilitated the analysis of metabolic function and regulation at the global gene expression level. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets differing in protein and energy density level on gene expression in adipose tissue of growing replacement dairy heifers using next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Norwegian Red heifers were fed either a high- or low-protein concentrate (HP/LP) and a high- or low-energy roughage (HE/LE) diet from 3 months of age until confirmed pregnancy to give four treatments (viz, HPHE, HPLE, LPHE, LPLE) with different growth profiles. Subcutaneous adipose tissue sampled at 12 months of age was analyzed for gene expression differences using RNAseq. The largest difference in gene expression was found between LPHE and LPLE heifers, for which 1092 genes were significantly differentially expressed, representing an up-regulation of mitochondrial function, lipid, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism as well as changes in the antioxidant system in adipose tissue of LPHE heifers. Differences between HPHE and HPLE heifers were much smaller, and dominated by genes representing NAD biosynthesis, as was the significantly differentially expressed genes (DEG) common to both HE-LE contrasts. Differences between HP and LP groups within each energy treatment were minimal. This study emphasizes the importance of transcriptional regulation of adipose tissue energy metabolism, and identifies candidate genes for further studies on early-stage obesity and glucose load in dairy cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2891068580,"Food preferences may be driven by a species’ ecology. Closely related species such as dogs and wolves may have evolved preferences for different foods owing to their differing foraging styles. Wolves have been shown to be more persistent in problem-solving experiments and more risk-prone in a foraging task. A possible element affecting these (and other) results is a potential wolf-dog difference in food preferences. To address this possibility, we tested similarly raised and kept dogs and wolves in two different food choice tasks, a classic two-choice task and a multiple-choice paradigm. We predicted that if dogs have adapted to a more opportunistic, scavenging foraging style, they would show a weaker preference for meat over starch rich foods (such as kibble) and be less affected by hunger than wolves. Alternatively, given the recentness of the new niche dogs have created, we predicted no substantial differences between dogs’ and wolves’ food preferences. We found that our subjects did not differ in their preference for meat over kibble in either paradigm. However, wolves’ (but not dogs’) choice patterns were affected by satiation, with wolves being less “selective” when hungry. Furthermore, when fed before testing, wolves were more selective than dogs. These differences were more noticeable in the multiple-choice paradigm than the two-choice task, suggesting that the former, novel paradigm may be more sensitive and better capable of evaluating food preferences in a diverse range of species. Overall, we found that the distinct differences in wolves’ and dogs’ ecology and foraging styles do not appear to have affected their food preferences and thus, differences in food preferences are unlikely to have influenced results of previous experiments demonstrating wolf-dog differences in cognitive skills."
https://openalex.org/W2891383420,"Helicobacter pylori has a number of well-characterized carbohydrate-binding adhesins (BabA, SabA, and LabA) that promote adhesion to the gastric mucosa. In contrast, information on the glycoconjugates present in the human stomach remains unavailable. Here, we used MS and binding of carbohydrate-recognizing ligands to characterize the glycosphingolipids of three human stomachs from individuals with different blood group phenotypes (O(Rh−)P, A(Rh+)P, and A(Rh+)p), focusing on compounds recognized by H. pylori. We observed a high degree of structural complexity, and the composition of glycosphingolipids differed among individuals with different blood groups. The type 2 chain was the dominating core chain of the complex glycosphingolipids in the human stomach, in contrast to the complex glycosphingolipids in the human small intestine, which have mainly a type 1 core. H. pylori did not bind to the O(Rh−)P stomach glycosphingolipids, whose major complex glycosphingolipids were neolactotetraosylceramide, the Lex, Lea, and H type 2 pentaosylceramides, and the Ley hexaosylceramide. Several H. pylori-binding compounds were present among the A(Rh+)P and A(Rh+)p stomach glycosphingolipids. Ligands for BabA-mediated binding of H. pylori were the Leb hexaosylceramide, the H type 1 pentaosylceramide, and the A type 1/ALeb heptaosylceramide. Additional H. pylori-binding glycosphingolipids recognized by BabA-deficient strains were lactosylceramide, lactotetraosylceramide, the x2 pentaosylceramide, and neolactohexaosylceramide. Our characterization of human gastric receptors required for H. pylori adhesion provides a basis for the development of specific compounds that inhibit the binding of this bacterium to the human gastric mucosa."
https://openalex.org/W2890918884,"Background Medical end-of-life decisions (MELD) and shared decision-making are increasingly important issues for a majority of persons at the end of life. Little is known, however, about the impact of physician characteristics on these practices. We aimed at investigating whether MELDs depend on physician characteristics when controlling for patient characteristics and place of death. Methods and findings Using a random sample (N = 8,963) of all deaths aged 1 year or older registered in Switzerland between 7 August 2013 and 5 February 2014, questionnaires covering MELD details and physicians' demographics, life stance and medical formation were sent to certifying physicians. The response rate was 59.4% (N = 5,328). Determinants of MELDs were analyzed in binary and multinomial logistic regression models. MELDs discussed with the patient or relatives were a secondary outcome. A total of 3,391 non-sudden nor completely unexpected deaths were used, 83% of which were preceded by forgoing treatment(s) and/or intensified alleviation of pain/symptoms intending or taking into account shortening of life. International medical graduates reported forgoing treatment less often, either alone (RRR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.21–0.41) or combined with the intensified alleviation of pain and symptoms (RRR = 0.44; 0.34–0.55). The latter was also more prevalent among physicians who graduated in 2000 or later (RRR = 1.60; 1.17–2.19). MELDs were generally less frequent among physicians with a religious affiliation. Shared-decision making was analyzed among 2,542 decedents. MELDs were discussed with patient or relatives less frequently when physicians graduated abroad (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50–0.87) and more frequently when physicians graduated more recently; physician's sex and religion had no impact. Conclusions Physicians' characteristics, including the country of medical education and time since graduation had a significant effect on the likelihood of an MELD and of shared decision-making. These findings call for additional efforts in physicians' education and training concerning end-of-life practices and improved communication skills."
https://openalex.org/W2891879622,"Notch signaling is conserved in most multicellular organisms and plays critical roles during animal development. The core components and major signal transduction mechanism of Notch signaling have been extensively studied. However, our understanding of how Notch signaling activity is regulated in diverse developmental processes still remains incomplete. Here, we report a genetic mosaic screen in Drosophila melanogaster that leads to identification of Notch signali ng modulators during wing development. We discovered a group of genes required for the formation of the fly wing margin, a developmental process that is strictly dependent on the balanced Notch signaling activity. These genes encode transcription factors, protein phosphatases, vacuolar ATPases and factors required for RNA transport, stability, and translation. Our data support the view that Notch signaling is controlled through a wide range of molecular processes. These results also provide foundations for further study by showing that Me31B and Wdr62 function as two novel modulators of Notch signaling activity."

https://openalex.org/W2890695886,"Background It is a wide-spread assumption about footbinding that footbound girls and women were more of an economic burden on their families than those never bound. It is often presumed that government policies and missionary campaigns ended footbinding. Methods/ Objectives We use regression and log-likelihood tests, with bootstrapping for confirmation, to analyze which of a series of ethnographically and historically hypothesized variables significantly correlate with footbinding. We also consider an indirect measure of government prohibitions. We analyze two large datasets based on oral surveys with elderly women of the last footbound generations from 12 inland Chinese provinces. Conclusions Handicraft production, particularly commercial handicraft production, correlates with whether Chinese girls were subjected to footbinding before 1950. Girlhood knowledge of government prohibitions against footbinding, an indirect measure of awareness by the adults who decided whether to bind a girl’s feet, did not correlate with whether women were ever footbound. Spinning cotton thread for commercial purposes (sale, wage, direct exchange) correlated with greater daily production, with great county-level variation in quantity produced. Moreover, Chinese commercial spinners labored more years before marriage than domestic spinners. Implications Chinese daughters—whether footbound or not—made important economic contributions to rural households, thus suggesting a need to revise our understanding of China’s gender and economic history. Further implications of our results are that research is warranted on the assumed efficacy of government prohibitions—in both rural and urban areas—and on the presumption that footbinding among elite Chinese women was unrelated to economic concerns, including handicraft production. The demonstrated economic correlates of footbinding in inland, rural China also suggest a need to reevaluate whether contemporary customs controlling and cloistering girls and women, such as female genital cutting in Africa and the threat of honor killings of girls and women in South Asia, might have economic correlates."
https://openalex.org/W2891055597,"Cancer/testis antigen TFDP3 belongs to the transcription factor DP(TFDP) family. It can bind to E2F family molecules to form a heterodimeric transcription factor E2F/TFDP complex. The complex is an important regulatory activator of cell cycle, involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and other important physiological activities. In addition, TFDP3 has also been found to be a tumor-associated antigen that only expresses in malignant tumor tissue and normal testicular tissue; Thus, it is closely related to tumor occurrence and development. In this study, our group investigated the expression of TFDP3 in mononuclear cell samples from a variety of tissue-derived malignant tumors, breast cancer and benign breast lesions. The results show that TFDP3 is expressed in the malignant form of various tissues. Moreover, our recent research had focused on the ability of TFDP3 to influence the drug resistance and apoptosis of tumor cells. To further clarify the mechanisms involved in tumor resistance, this study also examined the expression of TFDP3 and tumor cell autophagy regulation; Autophagy helps cells cope with metabolic stress (such as in cases of malnutrition, growth factor depletion, hypoxia or hypoxia) removes erroneously folded proteins or defective organelles to prevent the accumulation of abnormal proteins; and removes intracellular pathogens. Our results showed that TFDP3 expression can induce autophagy by up-regulating the expression of autophagic key protein LC3(MAP1LC3) and increasing the number of autophagosomes during chemotherapy of malignant tumors. Then, DNA and organelles damage caused by the chemotherapy medicine are repaired. Thus, TFDP3 contributes toward tumor cell resistance. When siRNA inhibits TFDP3 expression, it can reduce cell autophagy, improving the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2889829193,"We present an improved image analysis pipeline to detect the percent brain volume change (PBVC) using SIENA (Structural Image Evaluation, using Normalization, of Atrophy) in populations with Alzheimer’s dementia. Our proposed approach uses the improved brain extraction mask from BEaST (Brain Extraction based on nonlocal Segmentation Technique) instead of the conventional BET (Brain Extraction Tool) for SIENA. We compared four varying options of BET as well as BEaST and applied these five methods to analyze scan-rescan MRIs in ADNI from 332 subjects, longitudinal ADNI MRIs from the same 332 subjects, their repeat scans over time, and OASIS longitudinal MRIs from 123 subjects. The results showed that BEaST brain masks were consistent in scan-rescan reproducibility. The cross-sectional scan-rescan error in the absolute percent brain volume difference measured by SIENA was smallest (p≤0.0187) with the proposed BEaST-SIENA. We evaluated the statistical power in terms of effect size, and the best performance was achieved with BEaST-SIENA (1.2789 for ADNI and 1.095 for OASIS). The absolute difference in PBVC between scan-dataset (volume change from baseline to year-1) and rescan-dataset (volume change from baseline repeat scan to year-1 repeat scan) was also the smallest with BEaST-SIENA compared to the BET-based SIENA and had the highest correlation when compared to the BET-based SIENA variants. In conclusion, our study shows that BEaST was robust in terms of reproducibility and consistency and that SIENA’s reproducibility and statistical power are improved in multiple datasets when used in combination with BEaST."
https://openalex.org/W2891114136,"Background Partnerships in global health and development governance have been firmly established as a tool to achieve effective outcomes. Botswana implements Safe Male Circumcision (SMC) for HIV prevention through a North-South partnership comprising the local Ministry of Health, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (funded by PEPFAR) and Africa Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnership (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). The SMC partnership experienced significant antagony and the aim of this paper is to illuminate the actions and processes in the SMC program that contributed to that antagony. Methods Methods used to gather data include observation of the partners’ planning and strategic meeting in 2012, in-depth interviews with lead officers at national level, focus group discussions with district officers and implementers, younger male officers and old community members as recipients of the service. Results The findings reveal that the partnership experienced antagony during operational processes and as the ultimate outcome. Target setting, financial power of the North, superficial ownership given to the South, ignoring local traditional realities results in antagony. Three roots of antagony have been identified: 1. therapeutic domination–medical expertise given with arrogance; 2.iatrogenic violence–good intentions that cause unintended harm; 3. the Trojan horse–Reckless acceptance of the gift as well as deceptive power positioned under the pretext of benevolence. Conclusion The three roots of antagony; therapeutic domination, iatrogenic violence and the Trojan horse, constitute attitudes, hidden intentions and unintended consequences that influence program implementation and cause harm at different levels. Examples of therapeutic domination and the Trojan horse have highlighted the need for vigilance at the stage of establishing a partnership, to prevent more powerful partners from developing and applying hidden agendas and to strengthen accountability from the local partner. Iatrogenic violence has highlighted the need for partnership interventions to prevent good partner intentions accidentally producing bad outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2889960023,"A local immune response has been implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but it is unclear if systemic immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) protects against the onset and/or progression of AMD. We performed a retrospective cohort study using a Cox proportional hazards model of two cohorts. Cohort 1 included patients with stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) status post kidney transplantation, on at least one IMT agent, and older than 50. Cohort 2 included patients with stage IV or V CKD who had not undergone kidney transplantation, were not on IMT, and were older than 50. The main outcomes were hazard ratios of a new diagnosis of dry AMD, wet AMD, or conversion from dry to wet. There were 10,813 patients in cohort 1, and 217,081 patients in cohort 2. After controlling for sex and age, there was no significant difference in the hazard of developing a new diagnosis of dry AMD (HR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.87–1.05, p = 0.32), developing a new diagnosis of wet AMD without any prior diagnosis of dry AMD (HR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.66–1.08, p = 0.18), or converting from dry to wet AMD (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.94–1.62, p = 0.12). For patients over 70 on mycophenolate mofetil, there was a reduced hazard of converting from dry to wet AMD (HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.85–0.99, p = 0.02). In contrast, everolimus had an increased hazard of dry AMD (HR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.24–3.69, p < 0.01). Most systemic IMT does not affect the risk of onset or progression of AMD in patients with CKD. However, mycophenolate mofetil may confer some degree of protection against the conversion of dry AMD to wet AMD, suggesting that modulation of the immune response may prevent progression of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2890062252,"Twitter data are becoming an important part of modern political science research, but key aspects of the inner workings of Twitter streams as well as self-censorship on the platform require further research. A particularly important research agenda is to understand removal rates of politically charged tweets. In this article, I provide a strategy to understand removal rates on Twitter, particularly on politically charged topics. First, the technical properties of Twitter’s API that may distort the analyses of removal rates are tested. Results show that the forward stream does not capture every possible tweet –between 2 and 5 percent of tweets are lost on average, even when the volume of tweets is low and the firehose not needed. Second, data from Twitter’s streams are collected on contentious topics such as terrorism or political leaders and non-contentious topics such as types of food. The statistical technique used to detect uncommon removal rate patterns is multilevel analysis. Results show significant differences in the removal of tweets between different topic groups. This article provides the first systematic comparison of information loss and removal on Twitter as well as a strategy to collect valid removal samples of tweets."
https://openalex.org/W2891197777,"Despite a large body of research on response properties of neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, studies to date have not yet produced quantitative feature descriptions that can predict responses to arbitrary objects. This deficit in the research prevents a thorough understanding of object representation in the IT cortex. Here we propose a fragment-based approach for finding quantitative feature descriptions of face neurons in the IT cortex. The development of the proposed method was driven by the assumption that it is possible to recover features from a set of natural image fragments if the set is sufficiently large. To find the feature from the set, we compared object responses predicted from each fragment and responses of neurons to these objects, and search for the fragment that revealed the highest correlation with neural object responses. Prediction of object responses of each fragment was made by normalizing Euclidian distance between the fragment and each object to 0 to 1 such that the smaller distance gives the higher value. The distance was calculated at the space where images were transformed to a local orientation space by a Gabor filter and a local max operation. The method allowed us to find features with a correlation coefficient between predicted and neural responses of 0.68 on average (number of object stimuli, 104) from among 560,000 feature candidates, reliably explaining differential responses among faces as well as a general preference for faces over to non-face objects. Furthermore, predicted responses of the resulting features to novel object images were significantly correlated with neural responses to these images. Identification of features comprising specific, moderately complex combinations of local orientations and colors enabled us to predict responses to upright and inverted faces, which provided a possible mechanism of face inversion effects.

https://openalex.org/W2950667628,"The ABC transporter ABCG1 contributes to the regulation of cholesterol efflux from cells and to the distribution of cholesterol within cells. We showed previously that ABCG1 deficiency inhibits insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells and, based on its immunolocalization to insulin granules, proposed its essential role in forming granule membranes that are enriched in cholesterol. While we confirm elsewhere that ABCG1, alongside ABCA1 and oxysterol binding protein OSBP, supports insulin granule formation, the aim here is to clarify the localization of ABCG1 within insulin-secreting cells and to provide added insight regarding ABCG1’s trafficking and sites of function. We show that stably expressed GFP-tagged ABCG1 closely mimics the distribution of endogenous ABCG1 in pancreatic INS1 cells and accumulates in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) and on the cell surface but not on insulin granules, early or late endosomes. Notably, ABCG1 is short-lived, and proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors both decrease its degradation. Following blockade of protein synthesis, GFP-tagged ABCG1 first disappears from the ER and TGN and later from the ERC and plasma membrane. In addition to aiding granule formation, our findings raise the prospect that ABCG1 may act beyond the TGN to regulate activities involving the endocytic pathway, especially as the amount of transferrin receptor is increased in ABCG1-deficient cells. Thus, ABCG1 may function at multiple intracellular sites and the plasma membrane as a roving sensor and modulator of cholesterol distribution, membrane trafficking and cholesterol efflux."
https://openalex.org/W2891819968,"1D and 2D NMR investigations as well as computational studies, including static quantum-mechanics calculations, density function theory formalism, and classical molecular dynamics, were applied to determine the protonation sites in the thermolabile protecting group (TPG) containing a 2-pyridynyl moiety within its structure. This protecting group has three possible sites for protonation: an azomethine (pyridinic) atom (N1), 2-aminoethanol residue (N2), and 4-amino substituent (N4). Our investigations showed that the protonation mainly occurs on the N1 atom. Such protonation seems to be a major inhibitory factor in the thermal removal of 2-pyridynyl TPG by the “chemical switch” approach and decreases the aromaticity of the pyridine ring. We also discussed possible participation of N2 nitrogen in irreversible intramolecular cyclization under acidic conditions."

Nevertheless the health risks of smoking are still underestimated in many smokers. The present study aimed to examine neurobiological responses to graphical warnings on cigarette packings in non-smokers and patients with tobacco dependence.Twenty non-smokers and twenty-four patients with tobacco dependence participated in a functional MRI study during that pictures of different categories were presented ((a) EU-warning pictures, (b) text-only warnings, (c) neutral pictures with short information). Patients contributed twice in the experiment (after 10 hours nicotine withdrawal / about 5 minutes after nicotine consumption).Smokers during withdrawal demonstrated increased neuronal responses predominantly in subcortical, temporal and frontal brain regions that are associated with emotional and cognitive processes during the presentation of graphical warnings compared to neutral pictures. In smokers after smoking and non-smokers, the differences between graphical warnings and neutral pictures were increased compared to smokers during withdrawal. The comparison of the graphical warnings with text-only labels demonstrated the importance of affective brain regions especially in smokers after smoking and in non-smokers. During withdrawal, the neural responses associated with graphical warnings and text-only labels differed only marginally.The results suggest that emotional and cognitive reactions to graphical warnings are predominantly seen in smokers after smoking and in non-smokers. The impact of these pictures during withdrawal seems to be less pronounced; in this case, more unspecific processes seem to be important, including the projection of sensory signals to the cerebral cortex."
