In species such as the rabbit, which possess hepatic enzymes capable of metabolizing methotrexate to inactive products, the drug is rapidly degraded and virtually non-toxic2. In species which do not metabolize the drug, such as mouse and man, the dose-limiting bone marrow and gastro-intestinal toxicity seems to result from persistence of low (10−7 to 10−9 M) plasma levels of methotrexate for many hours after its administration3,4. To counteract this toxicity, 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate, or leucovorin, has been given 12–36 h after high doses of methotrexate, allowing an improvement in the drug's therapeutic index5,6."

https://openalex.org/W2006729953,"Ashby and Whitehead1 have published evidence of the observation of fluxes of photons lasting ≤ 1 s at an energy corresponding to positron annihilation, in connexion with the possibility that “ball lightning” may be associated with the existence in the terrestrial environment of small quantities (∼ 10−11 g) of antimatter. Here I shall present evidence that fluxes of this type, at about the observed frequency, can be expected from extensive air showers caused by primary cosmic rays of energy E0∼1016 eV."

https://openalex.org/W2047543256,"IN his report “Alpha Rhythms in the Hyperkinetic Child”1, Shetty attempts to define the neurophysiological substrate of hyperkinesis by interpreting drug-induced variations in the alpha rhythms of the human electroencephalogram (EEG). Such an attempt presumes knowledge of the origin of alpha rhythms, but the single article2 to which Shetty refers, and which is said to allege that “alpha rhythms represent an inhibitory process involving discharge of sub-cortical influences back into the cortex, and effecting the termination of cortical excitation associated with automatization or habituation of learned behaviour”, in fact contains no evidence on such physiological processes. It refers in turn to an earlier physiological observation—the so-called “recruiting response” in cats3, which may or may not have any connexion with human alpha rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W2114681883,"THE “Arrow of Time” has been much discussed by philosophers and by some scientists1, and various manifestations, which have also been offered as explanations of this directionality, are to be noted in the world around us. For example, asymmetry of time is observed in thermodynamics, an increase in entropy is predicted from statistical mechanics, there is a consistent choice of retarded solutions to time symmetric equations of radiation theory and expansion of the universe is deduced from cosmological theory; in addition a temporal arrow is inferred from the asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the universe. A striking feature of such observations is that the directions of the arrows agree."
https://openalex.org/W1969896592,"THE exposure times involved in obtaining X-ray diffraction patterns are an obstacle to the study of dynamic processes. Several workers have tried to devise visual presentations of the diffraction patterns from transient Crystallographic events, and recently Chester and Koch1 reported some success using a vidicon tube which was sensitive to X-rays and which had a complex diode mosaic as photocathode. Other workers, including ourselves, have used a phosphor as an image converter, the visual image produced by the phosphor being amplified by a high-gain image intensifier. We have had some success with an image intensifier that has a television read-out, but the equipment is expensive, cumbersome, and has to be custom-built. Here we report that acceptable results can be obtained using relatively cheap standard night surveillance equipment currently being produced in the USA and available in the UK. These units are designed to be carried in the hand or even mounted on a rifle and are extremely compact and portable."
