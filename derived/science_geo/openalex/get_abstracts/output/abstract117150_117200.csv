We report here the isolation and characterization of a [3H]gabapentin-binding protein from pig cerebral cortex membranes. The detergent-solubilized binding protein was purified 1022-fold, in a six-step column-chromatographic procedure, with a yield of 3.9%. The purified protein had an apparent subunit Mr of 130,000, and was heavily glycosylated. The partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of the Mr 130,000 polypeptide, EPFPSAVTIK, was identical to that reported for the α2δ subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel from rabbit skeletal muscle (Hamilton, S. L., Hawkes, M. J., Brush, K., Cook, R., Chang, R. J., and Smilowitz, H. M.(1989) Biochemistry 28, 7820-7828). High levels of [3H]gabapentin binding sites were found in membranes prepared from rat brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Binding of [3H]gabapentin to COS-7 cells transfected with α2δ cDNA was elevated >10-fold over controls, consistent with the expression of α2δ protein, as measured by Western blotting. Finally, purified L-type Ca2+ channel complexes were fractionated, under dissociating conditions, on an ion-exchange column; [3H]gabapentin binding activity closely followed the elution of the α2δ subunit. [3H]Gabapentin is the first pharmacological agent described that interacts with an α2δ subunit of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel.

https://openalex.org/W2014222535,"S. cerevisiae inherits its vacuole by projecting vacuole-derived membrane vesicles and tubules into the bud, where they fuse to establish the daughter vacuole. This homotypic fusion event can be assayed in vitro. It requires Sec17p and Sec18p, the homologs of the mammalian alpha-SNAP and NSF, which cooperate in multiple steps of membrane trafficking. We now report that Sec17p, Sec18p, and ATP are only needed for an early stage of the reaction that results in Sec17p release. Sec17p and Sec18p actions precede, and are needed for, the step employing the Ras-like GTPase Ypt7p. Sec18p-driven release of Sec17p can even precede vacuole docking, as it can occur prior to mixing of vacuoles and is insensitive to vacuole concentration. Sec17p and Sec18p thus may function in a predocking stage of the reaction, rather than in bilayer fusion per se."
https://openalex.org/W2093371722,"Regulation of obese gene (ob) expression in ob/ob and db/db mice and in cultured rat adipocytes was examined. It has been demonstrated that exogenous human OB protein (leptin) treatment reduces food intake and weight gain, as well as insulin, glucose, and corticosterone levels in ob/ob mice. In the present report we show that leptin treatment down-regulates endogenous adipose ob mRNA. However, treatment of isolated rat adipocytes with 100 ng/ml human or murine leptin had no direct effect on expression of endogenous ob mRNA, suggesting that leptin may be able to down-regulate its own expression by an indirect, non-autocrine mechanism. Glucocorticoids increased both ob mRNA levels and secreted leptin levels in vitro. Conversely, agents that increase intracellular cAMP, such as β-adrenergic agonists or Bt2cAMP itself, decreased ob mRNA expression and leptin secretion. Therefore, increased glucocorticoid levels and decreased sympathetic neural activity may contribute to the elevated ob mRNA expression observed in genetically obese, hyperglucocorticoid rodents. Furthermore, leptin might regulate its own expression through a feedback mechanism involving the hypothalamic pituitary axis.

https://openalex.org/W1719035976,"Prolonged and severe sleep deprivation is associated with alterations of natural and cellular immune function. To determine whether alterations of immune function also occur after even a modest loss of sleep, the effects of early-night partial sleep deprivation on circulating numbers of white blood cells, natural killer (NK) cell number and cytotoxicity, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell number and activity, and stimulated interleukin-2 (IL-2) production were studied in 42 medically and psychiatrically healthy male volunteers. After a night of sleep deprivation between 10 P.M. and 3 A.M., a reduction of natural immune responses as measured by NK cell activity, NK activity per number of NK cells, LAK activity, and LAK activity per number of LAK precursors (CD16,56, CD25) was found. In addition, concanavalin A-stimulated IL-2 production was suppressed after sleep deprivation due to changes in both adherent and nonadherent cell populations. After a night of recovery sleep, NK activity returned to baseline levels and IL-2 production remained suppressed. These data implicate sleep in the modulation of immunity and demonstrate that even a modest disturbance of sleep produces a reduction of natural immune responses and T cell cytokine production."

We have cross-linked 125I-VEGF165 to the cell surface of various tumor cell lines and of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. High molecular mass (220 and 240 kDa) and/or lower molecular mass (165 and 175 kDa) labeled complexes were detected depending on the cell type. The 220- and 240-kDa labeled complexes were shown to contain FLT and FLK/KDR receptors, respectively. On the other hand, the 165- and 175-kDa complexes did not seem to contain FLK/KDR or FLT but instead appeared to contain novel VEGF receptors with relatively low molecular masses of approximately 120 and 130 kDa. These receptors were further characterized in breast cancer MDA MB 231 cells (231), which did not form the high molecular mass complexes and which did not express detectable amounts of flk/kdr or flt mRNA. The 231 cells displayed one VEGF165 binding site, with a Kd of 2.8 × 10-10M and 0.95-1.1 × 105 binding sites per cell. By comparison, human umbilical vein endothelial cells had two binding sites, one with a Kd of 7.5 × 10-12M, presumably FLK/KDR, and the other with a Kd of 2 × 10-10M, a value similar to the VEGF binding sites on 231 cells. These lower affinity/molecular mass receptors on 231 cells cross-linked 125I-VEGF165 but not 125I-VEGF121. Accordingly, exon 7 of VEGF, which encodes the 44 amino acids present in VEGF165 that are absent in VEGF121, was fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). The GST-VEGF-exon 7 fusion protein bound to heparin-Sepharose with a similar affinity as VEGF165 and inhibited the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to 231 cells. Cross-linking of 125I-GST-VEGF-exon 7 to 231 cells resulted in the formation of 150- and 160-kDa labeled complexes that presumably contained the 120- and 130-kDa lower affinity/molecular mass VEGF165 receptors. It was concluded that certain tumor-derived cell lines express novel surface-associated receptors that selectively bind VEGF165 via the exon 7-encoded domain, which is absent in VEGF121.

Several studies point to VEGF as being an important regulator of angiogenesis. For example, VEGF expression is up-regulated in tissues undergoing vascularization during embryogenesis and during the female reproductive cycle(6.Shweiki D. Itin A. Neufeld G. Gitay-Goren H.

High levels of VEGF are found in various types of tumors in response to tumor-induced hypoxia but not in normal tissue(8.Plate K.H. Beier G. Millauer B. Ullrich A. Risau W.

A recent study has directly linked VEGF to vascularization-dependent tumor growth by showing that treatment of tumors with monoclonal antibodies directed against VEGF resulted in a dramatic reduction in tumor angiogenesis and tumor mass(13.Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Four different VEGF isoforms, consisting of 121, 165, 189, and 206 amino acids, are produced as a result of alternative splicing from a single gene containing eight exons(14.Tischer E. Mitchell R.

Rev. 1992; 13: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). The active form of VEGF is a homodimer, and all four isoforms display a similar ability to induce EC proliferation(15.Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Although all VEGF isoforms are synthesized with a signal peptide that allows secretion, they differ in their localization probably as a result of differential affinities for heparan sulfate proteoglycans that are found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix(15.Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, 17.Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N.

VEGF189 and VEGF206 have a high affinity for heparan sulfate and are mostly cell and extracellular matrix-associated. VEGF165, which has a lower affinity for heparan sulfate, is partially released into the culture medium and partially found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. VEGF121 is the only VEGF isoform that does not bind to heparin and is exclusively secreted into the culture medium(15.Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol.

Efficient binding of 125I-VEGF165 to its receptors on EC requires the presence of heparin-like molecules on the cell surface(20.Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol.

The binding of VEGF to VEGF receptors on non-EC does not seem to induce cell proliferation. Rather, VEGF induces motility of monocytes(32.Clauss M. Gerlach M. Gerlach H. Brett J. Wang F.

These results suggest that although VEGF can bind to multiple receptors on the cell surface, the subsequent VEGF-mediated responses may be different. Cross-linking of 125I-VEGF165 to EC and non-EC results in the formation of multiple 125I-VEGF165-VEGF receptor labeled complexes, with higher molecular masses of about 220-240 kDa and lower molecular masses of about 165-175 kDa(19.Vaisman N.

However, to date it has not been clear which of the known VEGF receptors are contained in the various labeled complexes. In this report, we demonstrate (i) that the high molecular mass complexes found in EC and melanoma cells contain FLK or FLT; (ii) that the lower molecular mass complexes do not appear to contain FLK or FLT but rather VEGF receptors of relatively lower affinity; (iii) that the lower affinity/molecular mass receptors found on tumor cells are isoform-specific in that they bind 125I-VEGF165 but not 125I-VEGF165, in agreement with previous results obtained for HUVEC(41.Gitay-Goren H.

MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-453 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and a mixture of glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. RU-mel cells and EP-mel cells were kindly provided by Dr. Randolf Byer (Boston University Medical School, Boston, MA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-containing 2% FCS, 8% calf serum, and a mixture of glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Human metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, LNCaP cells, were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Freeman (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA) and grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and a mixture of glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The iodination of VEGF165, VEGF121, and GST-VEGF-exon 7 were carried out using IODO-GEN as described previously(29.Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Sharon R. Shibuya M. Halaban R. Levi B.Z. Neufeld G. J. Biol.

Aliquots of the iodinated proteins were frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. The specific activity ranged between 30,000 and 100,000 cpm/ng protein. Binding and cross-linking experiments using 125I-VEGF165, 125I-VEGF121, and 125I-GST-VEGF-exon 7 were performed as described previously (19.Vaisman N. Gospodarowicz D. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19461-19466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol.

For the immunoprecipitation of cross-linked complexes, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min on ice. The cell lysate was collected in a tube and spun at 7000 × g for 5 min to remove the cell debris. The lysate was incubated with Sephadex CL-4B for 1 h at 4°C and then separated from the Sephadex beads by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min. Anti-FLK and anti-FLT antibodies were added to the lysates, and following 1 h of incubation at 4°C, 20 μl of protein G (coupled to Sephadex CL-4B) were added for an additional 1 h of incubation at 4°C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were pelleted at 1000 × g for 3 min, washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min, and proteins were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE(43.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and scanned after 24 h of exposure. Subsequently, the polyacrylamide gels were exposed to x-ray film. VEGF binding was quantitated by measuring the cell-associated radioactivity in a γ counter (Beckman, Gamma 5500). The counts represent the average of three wells. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and similar results were obtained. Exon 7 of VEGF was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the primers CGGGATCCCCTGTGGGCCTTGCTC and GGAATTCTTAACATCTGC-AAGTACGTT. The amplified DNA was digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and cloned in frame into the GST-expressing vector pGEX-2TK (44.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) to yield the p2TK-exon 7 plasmid. Escherichia coli (DH5α) transformed with p2TK-exon 7 were used to produce the GST-VEGF exon 7 (GST-ex 7) fusion protein, and the GST-ex 7 was purified from the bacterial lysate by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography(44.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Glutathione-agarose-purified GST-ex 7 was applied to a TSK-Heparin column (3.75 ml), which was then washed extensively with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.2 M NaCl. GST-ex 7 was eluted from the column by a linear gradient of 0.2-1.2 M NaCl, pH 7.2. Samples eluted from the column were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE (43.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) and silver staining. 125I-VEGF165 was cross-linked to cells in the presence or the absence of 1 μg/ml heparin (Fig. 1). As reported previously(19.Vaisman N. Gospodarowicz D. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19461-19466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), cross-linking of 125I-VEGF165 to HUVEC resulted in the formation of a 240-kDa labeled complex (Fig. 1, lane 1). In the presence of heparin, two additional labeled complexes of approximately 165 and 175 kDa were detected (Fig. 1, lane 2). Cross-linking of 125I-VEGF165 to the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (231 cells) (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4) and to the prostate tumor cell line LNCaP (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6) produced similar complexes of approximately 165-175 kDa but not the 240-kDa labeled complex. In contrast, the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453 (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8) did not cross-link 125I-VEGF165 at all. Cross-linking of 125I-VEGF165 to the surface of two melanoma cell lines, EP-mel and RU-mel, resulted in the formation of several labeled complexes ranging from 150 to 240 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 10). The addition of heparin enhanced 125I-VEGF165 binding and cross-linking to 231 cells (Fig. 1, lane 4) and LNCaP (Fig. 1, lane 6) cells but did not cause the appearance of any labeled complex in MDA-MB-453. The binding of 125I-VEGF165 to the cells was specific because the addition of a 100-fold excess of nonlabeled VEGF165 completely inhibited the formation of the labeled complexes (not shown).Figure 2:Immunoprecipitation of 125I-VEGF165 cross-linked complexes containing VEGF receptors. 125I-VEGF165 (5 ng/ml) was bound and cross-linked to subconfluent cultures of HUVEC (lanes 1-3), 231 cells (lanes 4-6), EP-mel cells (lanes 7-9), and RU-mel cells (lanes 10-12) in 10-cm dishes. The binding was carried out in the presence of 1 μg/ml heparin, except for RU-mel. The cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLK (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11) and anti-FLT (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12) antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples of cell lysate were kept aside before the antibodies were added to serve as controls (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). The immunocomplexes were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the observed 125I-VEGF165-VEGF receptor cross-linked complexes contained FLK/KDR or FLT, specific anti-FLK and anti-FLT antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate these complexes. The 240-kDa complexes of HUVEC (Fig. 2, lane 2), EP-mel cells (Fig. 2, lane 8) and bovine aortic endothelial cells (not shown) were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLK antibodies, whereas the 220-kDa complex of RU-mel was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLT antibodies (Fig. 2, lane 12). These results indicate that HUVEC and EP-mel cells synthesize predominantly FLK/KDR, whereas RU-mel cells synthesize FLT. These anti-VEGF receptor antibodies failed to immunoprecipitate the 165- and 175-kDa complexes from any of the cell lines (Fig. 2), suggesting that these complexes contain VEGF-receptors that are different than FLK/KDR or FLT. For further analysis of the 165- and 175-kDa complexes, we chose 231 cells because they did not produce the higher molecular mass complexes containing FLK/KDR or FLT, thus facilitating analysis of the lower molecular mass complexes. In addition, the expression of flk/kdr or flt mRNA could not be detected by a Northern blot analysis of 231 cell-derived RNA (not shown). Based on the molecular weight of a VEGF165 dimer (45 kDa), the receptors forming the 165- and 175-kDa labeled complexes were estimated to have molecular masses of approximately 120 and 130 kDa, respectively. To determine the affinity of VEGF165 for the 120- and 130-kDa receptors, 231 cells and HUVEC were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-VEGF165 (Fig. 3A). Binding of 125I-VEGF165 to 231 cells was carried out in the presence or the absence of heparin. The specific binding of 125I-VEGF165 to 231 cells increased in a dose-dependent manner and reached a plateau at approximately 1.9 × 10-10M (8.5 ng/ml). Heparin (1 μg/ml) induced an 80% increase in the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to 231 cells, in agreement with the heparin-induced augmentation of binding shown in Fig. 1(lanes 3 and 4). The binding results were used to generate Scatchard plots (Fig. 3, B-D), which were further analyzed by the LIGAND program(45.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). The program predicted the presence of a single class of binding sites on 231 cells with a Kdof 2.8 × 10-10M and 0.95-1.1 × 105 binding sites per cell (Fig. 3C). Heparin had no significant effect on the affinity of VEGF165 for its binding sites on 231 cells (Kd = 2.7 × 10-10) but induced a 2-fold increase in their number (1.9-2.0 × 105 binding sites/cell) (Fig. 3D). Thus, heparin enhances the binding of 125I-VEGF165 by increasing the number of available binding sites on 231 cells rather than by changing the affinity of VEGF165 for its binding sites. In comparison, HUVEC displayed two classes of binding sites for VEGF165, the higher affinity binding sites had a Kd of 7.5 × 10-12 and approximately 2 × 103 binding sites/cell, and the lower affinity binding sites had a Kd of 2.0 × 10-10M and 2.5 × 104 binding sites/cell (Fig. 3B). The similar Kd values of VEGF165 for its binding"

The addition of these cations to a DNA solution leads first to the precipitation of the DNA; further addition resolubilizes the DNA pellet. The multivalent salt concentration required for resolubilization is essentially independent of the DNA concentration (between 1 μg/ml and 1 mg/ml) and of the monovalent cation concentration present in the DNA solution (up to 100 mM). The DNA aggregates are anisotropic; those obtained in the presence of the polyamines spermidine and spermine generally contain a cholesteric liquid crystalline phase that flows spontaneously. In contrast this phase is never seen in the presence of cobalthexamine. We propose that the ability of polyamines to condense DNA in fluid structures is an essential feature of their biological functions.

In contrast this phase is never seen in the presence of cobalthexamine. We propose that the ability of polyamines to condense DNA in fluid structures is an essential feature of their biological functions. Multivalent cations with a charge of 3+ or greater induce the condensation of DNA in aqueous solution (reviewed in (1.Bloomfield V.A. Ma C. Arscott P.G. Schmitz K.S. Macro-Ion Characterization from Dilute Solutions to Complex Fluids. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1994: 195-209Google Scholar)). In extremely dilute DNA solutions, one can observe the monomolecular collapse of long chains; with more concentrated DNA solutions (of short or long chains), aggregation sets in. Electrostatic forces appear to be predominant in DNA condensation. For highly charged polyelectrolytes there is a strong electrostatic repulsion between the chains. One expects the addition of multivalent cations to decrease this repulsion. DNA condensation by multivalent cations has been analyzed within the framework of the counterion condensation theory developed by Manning (2.Manning G.S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 179-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). This theory predicts the fraction of the DNA charges neutralized by a given cation: a saturating trivalent cation for instance should neutralize 92% of the DNA charges. It has been shown experimentally that approximately 90% of the DNA charges must be neutralized before DNA condensation can occur(3.Wilson R.W. Bloomfield V.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2192-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 4.Widom J. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 431-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In addition, mono- and divalent cations compete with multivalent cations in the condensation process, in agreement with the proposal that the interactions are predominantly electrostatic. It is known, however, that a purely electrostatic model is insufficient to account for the experimental data; cobalthexamine is for instance five times more efficient as a condensing agent than spermidine, although these compounds have the same charge (3+)(4.Widom J. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 431-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). DNA condensation has been studied with the naturally occurring polyamines spermidine (3+) and spermine (4+), as well as with the inorganic cation cobalthexamine (3+). Experimental data indicate that condensation is usually coupled with an isotropic to an anisotropic transition. In particular, high molecular weight DNA aggregates formed by spermidine, spermine, or cobalthexamine give a strong equatorial reflection when analyzed by x-ray diffraction(5.Schellman J.A. Parthasaratary N. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 6.Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 246-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Based on these data, several types of crystalline and liquid crystalline structures have been suggested for these DNA aggregates(5.Schellman J.A. Parthasaratary N. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7.Damaschun G. Damaschun H. Misselwitz R. Zirwer D. Müller J.J. Zalenskaya I.A. Vorob'ev V.I. Pyatigorskaya T.L. Studia Biophys. 1986; 112: 127-137Google Scholar). We have recently undertaken a study of these DNA aggregates using short (about 150 base pairs long) DNA molecules(8.Sikorav J.-L. Pelta J. Livolant F. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1387-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the case of the trivalent cation spermidine, we have found that the aggregate is generally biphasic and contains a liquid crystalline phase. In the course of these experiments, we have observed that the addition of excess spermidine leads to the resolubilization of the DNA aggregates. In this work, we describe this phenomenon, which is also observed with the cations spermine and cobalthexamine. We compare the precipitation by multivalent cations with the classical salting out obtained at high salt concentration (9.Edsall J.T. Wyman J. Biophysical Chemistry. 1. Academic Press, New York1958: 263-282Google Scholar) and with the formation of coacervates(10.Bungenberg de Jong H.G. Kruyt H.R. Colloid Science. 2. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1949Google Scholar). We analyze the structures obtained with the three cations and discuss their biological significance. Short DNA fragments were prepared from calf thymus as described in (8.Sikorav J.-L. Pelta J. Livolant F. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1387-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The length of the fragments obtained ranged from 130 to 600 base pairs with 50% of 146 (±7) base pairs. DNA precipitation was induced by the addition of the following polycations: spermidine (3HCl, Fluka) (initial concentration, 392 mM; prepared in a TE buffer: 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA), cobalthexamine (3HCl, Fluka) (250 mM in TE buffer), and spermine (4HCl, Fluka) (400 mM in TE buffer). Two types of experiment were performed. First, the DNA concentration was kept constant at 1 mg/ml, and the salt concentration was varied. The NaCl concentration was varied from 4 mM to 1.2 M; the multivalent cation concentration was increased from 1 to 225 mM. In a second series of experiments the DNA concentration was varied from 1 μg/ml to 1 mg/ml. The NaCl concentration was kept constant at 25 mM, and the multivalent cation concentration was increased from 0 to 100 mM for spermidine and spermine. Following the addition of the salts to the solutions, the sample was vortexed, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 7 min. The amount of DNA remaining in the supernatant and in the pellet was determined by two methods: measurement of the absorbance at 260 nm or of the radioactivity of 32 P-labeled DNA. For the UV absorbance, an aliquot of the supernatant was recovered and diluted in a TE buffer solution containing a NaCl concentration identical to that of the sample. For the second method, 1 μg of DNA was treated with alkaline phosphatase, and 5′ end-labeled with T4 DNA kinase to a specific activity of about 5 × 107 cpm/μg. The labeled DNA was purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex NAP-5 column, and the eluted material (about 500 μl) was concentrated on a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon) to a final volume of about 50 μl. In a standard precipitation experiment, 10,000 cpm of this labeled DNA was added as a radioactive tracer. The radioactivity present in the pellet cannot reliably be determined by Cerenkov counting (in the 3H channel of the liquid scintillation counter). For this reason, the pellet was resuspended in 2 M NaCl, and the radioactivity present in the supernatant and in the pellet was measured in a toluene-based scintillation fluid. The concentration of multivalent cations required to either precipitate or resolubilize DNA was taken at the midpoint of the corresponding transitions (half-point concentration between zero precipitation and the maximal value obtained in precipitation). DNA was precipitated from a 1 mg/ml solution using various monovalent and multivalent salt concentrations. An aliquot of the pellet was recovered and deposited between slide and coverslip. The sample was sealed with DPX resin (Fluka) in order to prevent evaporation. The preparations were observed between linear crossed polars in a Nikon Optiphot microscope. DNA precipitation from a dilute solution (1 mg/ml) by spermidine, spermine, and cobalthexamine has been studied for multivalent cations concentrations ranging from 0 to 225 mM. The corresponding precipitation curves are shown on Fig. 1. At low NaCl concentration (25 mM), a common feature is observed for the three polycations: an increasing concentration leads first to an almost complete precipitation of the DNA, and further increase leads to the resolubilization of the pellet. This soluble state observed at high multivalent cation concentrations can be reached either directly without precipitation (in which case one may speak of a suppression of the precipitation) or by resolubilization of a pellet (the term that we use here). The phenomena of precipitation and resolubilization observed here are fully reversible, as noted in the case of precipitation in our previous work(8.Sikorav J.-L. Pelta J. Livolant F. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1387-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the case of the trivalent cation cobalthexamine, the amount of DNA remaining in the supernatant could not be determined by the absorption at 260 nm, because of the high absorption of cobalthexamine at this wavelength. For this reason, the radioactivity method alone was used for this cation. In the case of spermidine and spermine, the two methods (spectroscopic and radioactivity) have been used and can be compared (Fig. 1, A and B). For spermidine, there is a clear quantitative difference in the amount of DNA remaining in solution at about 10 mM spermidine (maximum of precipitation) determined by UV absorption (less than 5%) and by radioactivity (about 40%). This seems to be due to fractionation: we have analyzed the length of the fragments in the pellet and in the supernatant by gel electrophoresis. The supernatant fragments are shorter than the pellet fragments, and the differences were quantified by densitometry of the gels on a PhosphorImager (data not shown). As a result, the mass amount of 5′ end-labeled DNA precipitated by spermidine is underestimated by the radioactive method. Qualitatively however, the shape of the two curves determined by UV absorption and radioactivity are similar. For spermine, the two curves obtained at 25 mM (Fig. 1B) are in much better agreement. We observe, however, some scattering of the experimental data in the resolubilization zone for the UV determination. This is apparently due to the precipitation of the aliquot of the supernatant recovered for the UV measurement, when it is diluted in the TE buffer. Because of the experimental difficulties encountered with cobalthexamine and spermine, we have chosen to use the radioactivity method for the three cations. Several pieces of information can be extracted from a comparison of Fig. 1(A, B, and C). 1) The amount of multivalent cations required to precipitate DNA varies: the tetravalent spermine is the most efficient. The trivalent cobalthexamine is about four times more efficient that the trivalent spermidine. Similar observations have been made previously in studies of the condensation of DNA by these cations(4.Widom J. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 431-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 11.Osland A. Kleppe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12.Razin S. Rozansky R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 81: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Spermine and cobalthexamine can lead to an almost complete precipitation. This implies that they are more efficient in the precipitation of small fragments as previously observed for spermine at low DNA concentrations(13.Hoopes B.C. McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5493-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). 2) The amount of multivalent cations required to resolubilize DNA varies but with a different order; the midpoint for this transition corresponds to 50 mM spermidine, 90 mM, spermine and 220 mM cobalthexamine. 3) The presence of an increased NaCl concentration prevents DNA precipitation as observed previously for spermidine and spermine(12.Razin S. Rozansky R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 81: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14.Heby O. Agrell I. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1971; 352: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the case of spermidine no precipitation is observed for a NaCl concentration greater than 100 mM. This concentration does not fully prevent the precipitation by spermine or cobalthexamine. The suppressing effect can be observed at higher concentrations (500 mM for spermine, 1.2 M for cobalthexamine). The competing action of NaCl differs in the precipitation region and in the resolubilization region. In the precipitation region the presence of an increased amount of NaCl (100 mM instead of 25 mM) increases the concentration of spermine or cobalthexamine required for precipitation. This competition between mono- and multivalent cations has already been observed by several authors(3.Wilson R.W. Bloomfield V.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2192-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 4.Widom J. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 431-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 15.Subirana J.A. Vives J.L. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 2281-2283Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16.Krasnow M.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2687-2693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the resolubilization by excess spermine or cobalthexamine is only slightly affected by the presence of 100 mM NaCl rather than 25 mM NaCl, with the midpoint remaining unchanged. In the case of spermidine, resolubilization is also not affected by a change from 4 to 55 mM NaCl (data not shown). DNA precipitation by polyamines has been studied for different DNA concentrations ranging from 1 μg/ml to 1 mg/ml (Fig. 2). In these experiments the NaCl concentration was kept constant at 25 mM. We observe again the behavior described above. The addition of polyamines first leads to precipitation; further addition resolubilizes the DNA aggregate. The amount of multivalent cations required for DNA precipitation increases with DNA concentration at low concentrations (between 1 μg/ml and 50 μg/ml). Above 50 μg/ml, this concentration dependence is no longer observed for spermidine (Fig. 2A). The efficiency of the precipitation varies also with DNA concentration; it decreases from a maximal value of 60% (for 1 μg/ml) to 30% (for 50 μg/ml) and increases back to 60% (at 1 mg/ml). Using the data of Fig. 2A, one can show that between 1 and 50 μg/ml, the concentration of spermidine at the transition midpoint increases linearly with DNA concentration according to the equation: [sprmidine]agg=α[DNA]+β(Eq. 1) where α and β are constant parameters. This linear dependence has been previously observed for DNA condensation by polyamines (11.Osland A. Kleppe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and cobalthexamine(4.Widom J. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 431-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In the case of spermidine, we obtain α≈ 36 and β≈ 0,55 mM (the DNA concentration being expressed in terms of monomer concentration; 1 mg/ml corresponds to 3 mM). These values agree with those obtained previously(11.Osland A. Kleppe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast with the linear dependence observed for precipitation, the resolubilization by an excess polyamines is essentially independent of DNA concentration between 1 μg/ml and 1 mg/ml. This is easily seen for the resolubilization by spermine (Fig. 2B) and is illustrated in a better way for spermidine below (see Fig. 3A). The data of Fig. 2(A and B) have been used to draw a schematic phase diagram shown in Fig. 3(A and B). This phase diagram is composed of three regions: two monophasic regions and one region where phase separation occurs. The boundaries of this phase separation region correspond to the concentration of polycations required to precipitate (lower bound) or resolubilize (upper bound) DNA. The choice for these boundaries (midpoint of the transition) is somewhat arbitrary; however, the overall shape of the phase diagram is not modified by values of the polycation concentrations corresponding from 20 to 72% of the DNA remaining in solution (data not shown). The phase separation region is much wider for the tetravalent cation spermine (Fig. 3B) than for the trivalent spermidine (Fig. 3A). As observed above, the upper bound is essentially independent of the DNA concentration (Fig. 3A illustrates clearly this fact for spermidine). This contrasts with the lower boundary. Phase diagrams similar to those obtained here were described for another anionic polyelectrolyte (polystyrene sulfonate) in the presence of the trivalent cation LaCl3 and the tetravalent cation Th(NO3)14(17.Delsanti M. Dalbiez J.P. Spalla O. Belloni L. Drifford M. Schmitz K.S. Macro-Ion Characterization from Dilute Solutions to Complex Fluid. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1994: 381-392Google Scholar). For this polymer also the presence of increasing amounts of NaCl shrinks the phase separation region. For DNA in the presence of spermidine, the lower boundary gives a funnel-shaped phase separation region. The change in slope of the lower boundary coincides with the minimum efficiency of the precipitation process. We do not understand this correlation. DNA aggregates obtained in the presence of polyamines or cobalthexamine have been observed by polarizing microscopy. The nature of the aggregates obtained in the presence of polyamines depends on the NaCl and polycation concentrations, in contrast with the aggregates obtained in presence of cobalthexamine, where a unique phase is usually observed. In the presence of spermidine, there exist two types of condensed structures: a cholesteric liquid crystalline phase and a more concentrated phase (8.Sikorav J.-L. Pelta J. Livolant F. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1387-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of the two phases are modulated by ionic conditions: one finds either a pure cholesteric phase (not illustrated), a biphasic state (Fig. 4A), or a pure concentrated phase (not illustrated). These structures have been analyzed in greater detail elsewhere. ( 1D. Durand, J. Doucet, and F. Livolant, submitted for publication.) Pure concentrated phases are seen for spermidine concentrations just above the aggregation concentration, whereas pure cholesteric phases are found for NaCl or spermidine concentration close to the resolubilization concentration. We observe the same phenomenon for spermine; in Fig. 4B a pure concentrated phase is seen in the presence of 10 mM spermine and 25 mM NaCl. The structure is that of a dense cluster of germs that cannot always be seen individually. Between crossed polars, the intensity of the transmitted light is more intense than in the homologous phase with spermidine, which suggests a denser packing of the DNA helices. A pure cholesteric phase is observed in the presence of 90 mM spermine, 25 mM NaCl (Fig. 4C). In this last figure we note the presence of spherical germs with concentric layers, a texture characteristic of a cholesteric liquid crystal(18.Bouligand Y. Livolant F. J. Phys. 1984; 45: 1899-1923Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A common feature of the cholesteric phases obtained in the presence of spermidine and spermine is their fluidity; they both flow spontaneously. For both phases the helical pitch is much larger than the cholesteric helical pitch obtained in the presence of NaCl alone (about 20 versus 2.5 μm(19.Leforestier A. Livolant F. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 56-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)). DNA condensed in the presence of cobalthexamine yields a single phase (Fig. 4D), which is highly birefringent. This suggests a high packing density of the molecules, in agreement with interhelical spacing measured by x-ray diffraction: 27.5 (5.Schellman J.A. Parthasaratary N. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or 28.2 Å (6.Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 246-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) for cobalthexamine compared with 29.2 Å for spermine (5.Schellman J.A. Parthasaratary N. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and 29.4 Å for spermidine(5.Schellman J.A. Parthasaratary N. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 6.Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 246-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This structure does not flow spontaneously. The fluidity of this phase is therefore highly restricted but can be established by squeezing the sample between slide and coverslip. The structure is probably that of a columnar hexagonal liquid crystal. The time required for the appearance of the structure shown in Fig. 4D is much longer than the time required for the organization of the condensed states in the presence of polyamines. Following the addition of cobalthexamine to a DNA solution, the condensed phase first presents a structure identical to the structure obtained in the presence of spermine (Fig. 4B). This organization lasts a few days. The evolution to the texture seen in Fig. 4D requires about 1 week. In contrast this state is reached in a few hours with polyamines. The structure shown in Fig. 4D is the only one seen with cobalthexamine; cholesteric phases have never been seen, not even when an excess of cobalthexamine is present (corresponding to 55% DNA resolubilization). The precipitation of polyelectrolytes by salts is often called “salting out.” It is useful to clearly distinguish between a classical salting out behavior and the phenomenon observed here. The classical salting out describes the precipitation observed in the presence of high concentrations (typically 1 M or greater) of salts (usually monovalent). The precipitation is thought to be due essentially to the reduction of the activity of water in the solution that results from the high concentration of the hydrated salt ions(9.Edsall J.T. Wyman J. Biophysical Chemistry. 1. Academic Press, New York1958: 263-282Google Scholar). The activity of the polyelectrolyte is therefore increased, and its solubility decreases. The classical salting out behavior can be observed for DNA in presence of LiCl; precipitation take places for concentrations greater than 9 M(20.Wolf B. Berman S. Hanlon S. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3655-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21.Borochov N. Eisenberg H. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 1757-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast with the high monovalent salt concentrations required in a classical salting out, the precipitation by multivalent cations occurs at low concentrations that are not expected to greatly modify the activity of water. We are not therefore dealing with a classical salting out here. Bungenberg de Jong has described the precipitation of numerous polymers and colloids under various conditions(10.Bungenberg de Jong H.G. Kruyt H.R. Colloid Science. 2. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1949Google Scholar). According to his nomenclature, the precipitate can be an ordered solid (a true crystal) or can be in an amorphous state, either solid (a flocculate) or liquid (a coacervate). He has specifically described the precipitation of numerous polyelectrolytes in presence of micro-ions or polyelectrolytes and introduced the term of complex coacervation to describe the phase separation occurring in such system. In our experiments, we observe such a phase separation, but the precipitate, instead of being amorphous, is a highly ordered fluid. Nevertheless we propose that it should be considered as a complex coacervate (as already done for polylysine-DNA complexes(22.Shapiro J.T. Leng M. Felsenfeld G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)). We note here that the term “complex coacervation” is often specifically used to describe a complex between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes(23.Weis A. Biological Polyelectrolytes. Marcel Dekker, New York1970: 211-273Google Scholar). However the original definition of Bungenberg de Jong encompasses the condensation of DNA by 3+ and 4+ cations (p. 336 in (10.Bungenberg de Jong H.G. Kruyt H.R. Colloid Science. 2. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1949Google Scholar)). The difference between complex coacervation and a classical salting out can be illustrated in the following manner. Starting from DNA spermidine complex coacervate, the addition of increasing amounts of LiCl leads first to the resolubilization of the DNA aggregate (at about 0.2 M LiCl) and then to the reprecipitation corresponding to the classical salting out (which is observed at 12 M LiCl) (data not shown). Bungenberg de Jong has shown that solutions of highly charged polyelectrolyte chains precipitate upon addition of multivalent salts and resolubilize with further addition of the salts; this behavior has been observed for several types of polyelectrolytes including nucleic acids (sodium nucleate) and for various multivalent cations, including cobalt hexamine and an hexavalent cation (hexol nitrate). Similar observations have been also reported for polystyrene sulfonate (17.Delsanti M. Dalbiez J.P. Spalla O. Belloni L. Drifford M. Schmitz K.S. Macro-Ion Characterization from Dilute Solutions to Complex Fluid. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1994: 381-392Google Scholar) and DNA (this work). How can we explain precipitation and resolubilization? Counterion condensation alone is not sufficient to explain the appearance of an attractive force between similarly charged polyelectrolytes in the presence of multivalent cations(1.Bloomfield V.A. Ma C. Arscott P.G. Schmitz K.S. Macro-Ion Characterization from Dilute Solutions to Complex Fluids. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1994: 195-209Google Scholar). Net electrostatic attractive forces are obtained when charges fluctuations are taken into account. Correlated counterion fluctuations can lead to an attractive interaction, as first proposed by Oosawa (24.Oosawa F. Polyelectrolytes. Marcel Dekker, New York1971: 123-126Google Scholar). The effect of charge fluctuations on the interaction of highly charged polyelectrolyte in the presence of multivalent cations has also been recently studied by Olvera de la Cruz et al.(25.Olvera de la Cruz M. Belloni L. Delsanti M. Dalbiez J.P. Spalla O. Drifford M. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 5781-5791Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The authors used a model where condensed ions are considered as a random charge along a flexible polymer. They showed that the precipitation by multivalent salts can be explained by a short-range electrostatic attraction and that the resolubilization at high salts concentration is due to the screening of the short range electrostatic attraction. Their model accounts almost quantitatively for the experimental data obtained for the precipitation of polystyrene sulfonate. Another mechanism that could also explain the resolubilization phenomenon is that of a charge reversal. There are several reasons why such a mechanism should be considered. First, it is well known experimentally that the resolubilization in presence of multivalent cations can correlate with a charge reversal; several examples (for instance sodium nucleate plus an hexavalent cation) are discussed by Bungenberg de Jong (10.Bungenberg de Jong H.G. Kruyt H.R. Colloid Science. 2. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1949Google Scholar) who notes that transgression of solubility usually correlates with charge reversal. In the case of DNA, we know that already 90% of the charge is neutralized in the DNA aggregate(3.Wilson R.W. Bloomfield V.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2192-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 4.Widom J. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 431-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar); because DNA resolubilization is produced by increasing the concentration of multivalent cation, resolubilization should be accompanied by an increased binding of the cation. The possibility of a charge reversal is therefore not unlikely. We note in this respect that the charge reversal of DNA in aqueous MgCl2 solution has been observed for concentrations in excess of 1 N MgCl2. ( 2A. Papon and U. P. Strauss, unpublished results.) We have tested this hypothesis with a DNA sample dissolved in a buffer containing 70 mM spermidine (in which 70% of the DNA is soluble). This sample was submitted to electrophoresis in an agarose gel equilibrated in the same buffer, which was circulated during electrophoresis. The DNA migrates toward the anode (data not shown). This indicates that the net charge of DNA remains negative and seems to rule out the charge reversal hypothesis. To summarize, a purely electrostatic description of the behavior of polyelectrolytes in the presence of multivalent cations (25.Olvera de la Cruz M. Belloni L. Delsanti M. Dalbiez J.P. Spalla O. Drifford M. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 5781-5791Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar) accounts qualitatively for the phenomena of precipitation and resolubilization. It is clear however that this description is not sufficient to account for all the phenomena observed, in particular the existence of two distinct phases in equilibrium and their liquid crystalline nature in the case of polyamines. In addition, we observe that cations carrying the same 3+ charge have different behaviors; both the nature of the aggregates and the concentrations required for precipitation and resolubilization differ. Thus there exist specific ion effects depending not only on their charge but also on their structure. Several forces are supposed to be implicated in the stabilization of the DNA aggregates: van der Waals' interactions(26.Bloomfield V.A. Wilson R.W. Rau D.C. Biophys. Chem. 1980; 11: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), cross-links by condensing counterion(5.Schellman J.A. Parthasaratary N. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and hydration forces(6.Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 246-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We have argued previously that the existence of cross-links with spermidine is incompatible with the fluidity of the condensed phase.1 We can extend this reasoning to the case of spermine. Our findings support the delocalized binding expected from the counterion condensation theory (2.Manning G.S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 179-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar) that is observed for spermine in NMR (27.Wemmer D.E. Srivenugopal K.S. Reid B.R. Morris D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and photoaffinity cleavage experiments(28.Schmid N. Behr J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4357-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We conclude from these observations that the existence of localized sites and salt bridges is unlikely here. This does not rule out their existence for specific DNA sequences or in nonaqueous solvents. It is worth mentioning that the existence of the two types of aggregated phases reported here in the presence of spermidine and spermine has also been observed with short oligonucleotides (dodecamers) in the presence of spermidine, spermine, and cobalthexamine(29.Timsit, Y. (1991) Structure Cristallographique de Deux Dodécamères: Implication en Mutagénèse et en Recombinaison. Ph.D. Thesis, Université Louis Pasteur de StrasbourgGoogle Scholar, 30.Timsit Y. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 919-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These experiments and ours cannot be directly compared, because the solvent conditions are different. The oligonucleotides are aggregated in the presence of methyl-pentane-diol or Polyethylene glycol 4000. The biological implications of our results can be discussed from three points of view: physiological, biochemical, and evolutionary. From the physiological point of view, polyamines are ubiquitous compounds that are involved in numerous cellular processes(31.Cohen S.S. Introduction to the Polyamines. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971Google Scholar, 32.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). Their binding to DNA and also to RNA suggests that these compounds play an important role in nucleic acid function. The concentration of polyamines increase markedly upon stimulation of RNA synthesis; they have also been implicated in protein synthesis. Here we have observed that spermidine and spermine are able to condense DNA into highly fluid anisotropic structures (cholesteric liquid crystal). In contrast, the inorganic cation cobalthexamine only yields an anisotropic structure that does not flow spontaneously. We propose that this ability to interact with nucleic acids in a dense phase while preserving some fluidity is an essential feature required for their biological functions. This proposal makes specific predictions that can be tested. 1) The ability to condense nucleic acids into highly fluid anisotropic structures should also be observed with other nucleic acid structures such as RNA or nucleosomal DNA. In the case of RNA, liquid crystalline structures have already been observed for tranfer RNA in the absence of polyamines(33.Spencer M. Fuller W. Wilkins M.H.F. Brown G.L. Nature. 1962; 194: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We expect these nucleic acids to give rise to highly fluid anisotropic structure when condensed by polyamines. 2) There exist prokaryotic and eukaryotic mutants deficient in polyamine biosynthesis that are auxotrophic for polyamines(32.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). The addition of synthetic polyamine analogs can sometimes restore growth in these mutants. We expect the ability of these polyamines to restore growth to correlate with their ability to give rise to highly fluid anisotropic structures with nucleic acids in vitro. In particular, analogs that do not yield such structures should not be able to restore growth. We would like to make it clear that we do not propose that DNA is condensed in cellular systems by polyamines alone (a point of view already expressed by Gosule and Schellman(34.Gosule L.C. Schellman J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar)). Clearly, several factors are involved in the stabilization of compact forms of DNA such as specific proteins (histones in eukaryotes or histone-like proteins in prokaryotes), macromolecular crowding(35.Zimmerman S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), or DNA supercoiling. It appears that these different factors are able to cooperate in the stabilization of compact forms of DNA; macromolecular crowding for instance decreases the amount of cobalthexamine (6.Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 246-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) or histone-like proteins (36.Murphy L.D. Zimmerman S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) required for DNA condensation, and DNA supercoiling facilitates DNA condensation by divalent cations(37.Ma C. Bloomfield V.A. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1678-1681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our proposal deals rather with the required fluidity of the condensed structure present in the cells; the factors that are physiologically involved in DNA compaction should preserve fluidity. The biological significance of the resolubilization observed at higher polyamine concentrations is at present unclear, because the concentrations required (typically about 50 mM) appear unphysiological (the polyamines intracellular concentrations are in the millimolar range (about 10 mM)(31.Cohen S.S. Introduction to the Polyamines. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971Google Scholar, 32.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar)). It is possible, however, that there exist locally high concentrations of polyamine that are involved in decondensing rather than condensing processes or that the concentration required for an in vivo effect is lower than in in vitro experiments. In this respect, we note that the highest concentrations in polyamines are generally found at the G1 phase of the cell cycle(32.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). The suggestion has been made that these high concentrations are required in the cell's preparation for DNA synthesis. From the biochemical point of view, it is well known that polyamines are often used in vitro for the study of the functional properties of nucleic acids (see (8.Sikorav J.-L. Pelta J. Livolant F. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1387-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and references therein). They can increase the efficiency of different enzymatic systems. It is also known that they can be present in sufficient concentrations to precipitate the nucleic acids(32.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). A correlation between the stimulatory effect and the aggregation of nucleic acids has been demonstrated in several cases leading to the suggestion that the aggregate should be fluid. For instance the catenation of DNA by topoisomerases requires the aggregation of the DNA molecules by spermidine(16.Krasnow M.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2687-2693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inorganic cation cobalthexamine is also able to stimulate these enzymatic reactions albeit generally in a less efficient manner. We propose that this lower efficiency of cobalthexamine results in part from the lack of fluidity of the condensed DNA phase. One way to investigate the role of the fluidity of the DNA phase in such experiments is to induce DNA condensation prior to the addition of the enzyme (in contrast with most experiments where DNA condensation and the addition of the enzyme are simultaneous). In an aggregate lacking fluidity the stimulatory effect on the action of the enzyme should be very low or even absent. Finally, the experiments reported here can also be discussed from an evolutionary perspective. The ubiquity of polyamines among the cells is likely to reflect their antiquity. In addition to their compacting action and their role in the protection of DNA against shear degradation and UV irradiation, polyamines can increase the biochemical activities of DNA as noted above. All these properties led Baeza et al.(38.Baeza I. Ibañez M. Wong C. Chavez P. Gariglio P. Oro J. Origins Life Evol. Biosphere. 1992; 21: 225-242Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to propose that “compacted forms of DNA induced by polyamines may represent a primordial DNA genome.” The observation that such aggregates are fluid strengthens this proposal. We have seen above that such aggregates can be considered as coacervates. It is useful to recall here Oparin's classic proposal on the role of coacervation in prebiotic chemistry(39.Oparin A.I. Adv. Enzymol. 1965; 27: 347-380PubMed Google Scholar): coacervation is considered as an essential concentrating process by which mixtures of randomly formed prebiotic polymers initially in dilute solutions are condensed into concentrated assemblies. The phase separation of the polymers into separate coacervate droplets is thought to provide the appropriate medium required for the evolution of these prebiotic systems. According to the current view, Oparin's proposal suffers from the defect that it considered polypeptides rather than nucleic acids as a model for the primeval gene. The proposal of Baeza and co-workers as well as our present results should help reactualize Oparin's coacervation model in the perspective of a DNA (or an RNA) world. We thank Eric Gaillard for participation in experiments and Monica Olvera de la Cruz and Youri Timsit for useful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2103886590,"In Drosophila imaginal wing discs, the achaete–scute (ac–sc) proneural genes and rhomboid (veinlet) are expressed in highly resolved patterns that prefigure the positions of sensory organs and wing veins, respectively. It is thought that these patterns are generated by a combination of factors (a prepattern) regulating these genes. We provide evidence for the existence of this prepattern by identifying two of its factors, Araucan and Caupolican. They are members of a novel family of homeoproteins, with homologs in vertebrates. Araucan and Caupolican, present in domains of the imaginal discs larger than those expressing ac–sc and rhomboid, are necessary for expression of these genes in the overlapping domains. Araucan and Caupolican appear to be positive, direct regulators of ac–sc."
https://openalex.org/W1576457818,"We have recently shown that mechanical stress activates a phosphorylation cascade of protein kinases including Raf-1 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) in cultured cardiac myocytes partially through the enhanced secretion of angiotensin II. Osmotic stress in budding yeast has been shown to activate similar signaling molecules including Hog-1, a distant relative of the ERK family. In the present study, we examined whether mechanical stretch of cardiac myocytes activates the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs)/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, the mammalian homologs of yeast Hog-1 that regulate gene expression through activation of the transcription factor, AP-l. When cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats cultured on a deformable silicone dish were stretched, activity of SAPKs was increased from 10 min, peaked at 30 min, and gradually decreased thereafter. The increase in activity of SAPKs was proportional to the stretch. Unlike ERKs, the activation of SAPKs by stretching cardiac myocytes was not dependent on the secreted angiotensin II. The chelation of extracellular Ca2+ or down-regulation of protein kinase C did not attenuate activation of SAPKs by stretch. Transfection experiments using an AP-l binding site-containing reporter gene revealed that stretch increases AP-l activity in cardiac myocytes. In conclusion, like osmotic stress in yeast, mechanical stretch activates SAPKs in cardiac myocytes without the participation of angiotensin II. These results suggest that the activation of SAPKs may regulate gene expression during mechanical stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy.—Komuro, I., Kudo, S., Yamazaki, T., Zou, Y., Shiojima, I., Yazaki, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2044671573,"Intermittent plasma growth hormone (GH) pulses, which occur in male but not female rats, activate liver Stat 5 by a mechanism that involves tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of this latent cytoplasmic transcription factor (Waxman, D. J., Ram, P. A., Park, S. H., and Choi, H. K.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 13262-13270). We demonstrate that physiological levels of GH can also activate Stat 1 and Stat 3 in liver tissue, but with a dependence on the dose of GH and its temporal plasma profile that is distinct from Stat 5 and with a striking desensitization following a single hormone pulse that is not observed with liver Stat 5. GH activation of the two groups of Stats leads to their selective binding to DNA response elements upstream of the c-fos gene (c-sis-inducible enhancer element; Stat 1 and Stat 3 binding) and the β-casein gene (mammary gland factor element; liver Stat 5 binding). In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, GH is shown to stimulate phosphorylation of these Stats on serine or threonine in a manner that either enhances (Stat 1 and Stat 3) or substantially alters (liver Stat 5) the binding of each Stat to its cognate DNA response element. These findings establish the occurrence of multiple, Stat-dependent GH signaling pathways in liver cells that can target distinct genes and thereby contribute to the diverse effects that GH and its sexually dimorphic plasma profile have on liver gene expression.

GH exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the expression of a wide range of liver gene products, including cytochrome P450(1.Waxman D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), are also expressed in a GH-dependent manner. Studies carried out in rodents demonstrate that many, although not all, of the effects of GH on liver gene expression are sex-dependent. This sex dependence is a direct consequence of a striking differential response of individual target genes to GH, depending on whether hepatocytes are stimulated by the intermittent plasma pulses of GH that are characteristic of adult male rats or whether the cells are exposed to GH on a more continual basis, as occurs in adult female rats. Prototypic examples of this sex-dependent GH regulation are the cytochrome P450 genes CYP2C11 and CYP2C12, which are transcribed in a male- and female-specific manner, respectively, in adult rat liver in direct dependence on the plasma GH profile(11.Sundseth S.S.

Tyrosine phosphorylation is an early response to GH that has been documented in several cell types. GH induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular polypeptides(15.Campbell G.S. Christian L.J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7427-7434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including Jak2 kinase, a GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase that undergoes autophosphorylation following GH stimulation, and GH receptor, which becomes a substrate for Jak2 following GH-induced receptor dimerization (16.Argetsinger L.S.

Several of these latter signaling events are likely to involve interaction of the tyrosine-phosphorylated GH receptor-Jak2 kinase complex with these signaling molecules via SH2 domain interactions (25.Mayer B.J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), belongs to the Stat family of transcription factors; these factors serve as signal transducers and activators of transcription for numerous cytokines and growth factors. In response to cytokine treatment of target cells, Stats undergo tyrosine phosphorylation, homo- or heterodimerization, and nuclear translocation, followed by DNA binding and transcriptional activation of target genes(30.Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 31.Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierielder W.E. Kreider B. Silvennoinen O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 222-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Studies on the effects of GH on liver Stat 5, carried out in an adult rat model in vivo, have established that this GH-activated Stat is uniquely responsive to the temporal pattern of plasma GH stimulation: intermittent plasma GH pulses, such as those that occur naturally in adult male rats, trigger rapid and repeated tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of liver Stat 5, while continuous plasma GH exposure, as occurs in adult female rats, leads to desensitization of this tyrosine phosphorylation pathway and, consequently, a low steady-state level of the active nuclear Stat 5 transcription factor(18.Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This pattern of response suggests that liver Stat 5 may be an important intracellular mediator of the stimulatory effects of GH pulses on male-specific liver gene transcription. While liver Stat 5 appears to be the major Stat protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of hepatocytes by a physiological pulse of GH(18.Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), other liver-expressed Stat proteins may also be activated by GH. This is suggested by the finding that human GH can stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat 1 and Stat 3, both in 3T3-F442 fibroblasts (32.Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Cochran B.H. Argetsinger L.S.

Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3974-3979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and in livers of hypophysectomized rats (34.Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Gronowski A.M. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Thomas M.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 171-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relevance of these findings with respect to the somatotropic effects of GH is uncertain, however, given the binding of human GH to both prolactin receptors and GH receptors (36.Postel-Vinay M.C. FEBS Lett. 1976; 69: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37.Yamada K. Donner D.B. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and the use in the hypophysectomized rat studies of a dose of human GH that is supraphysiologic(34.Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Gronowski A.M. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Thomas M.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 171-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), being at least 50-fold higher than the dose required to activate liver Stat 5 (18.Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) or to stimulate pulsatile GH-dependent CYP2C11 gene expression in the same rat liver model(38.Waxman D.J. Pampori N.A. Ram P.A. Agrawal A.K. Shapiro B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6868-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It is also not known whether Stat 1 and Stat 3 respond to the temporal pattern of GH stimulation in a sex-specific manner, as does liver Stat 5. These questions are addressed in this study, where we characterize the activation of rat liver Stat 1 and Stat 3, in comparison to liver Stat 5, in response to physiological GH pulses given in vivo. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, we report a GH-induced Stat phosphorylation event that is distinct from the tyrosine phosphorylation step catalyzed by Jak2 kinase and involves either serine or threonine phosphorylation, leading to a significant enhancement (Stat 3 and Stat 1) or modulation (liver Stat 5) of the specific DNA binding activity of these Stat transcription factors. Male and female Fischer 344 rats, untreated or hypophysectomized at 8 weeks of age, were purchased from Taconic Farms Inc. (Germantown, NY) and were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle with free access to food and drinking water. The completeness of hypophysectomy was confirmed by the lack of weight gain over a 2-4-week period following surgery. Hypophysectomized rats were given rat GH (NIDDK, rGH-B-14-SIAFP; 1, 3, or 12.5 μg/100 g of body weight) by intraperitoneal injection, as indicated in individual experiments. All experiments used rat GH, unless specifically noted that human GH (NIDDK, hGH-B-1; 12.5 or 150 μg/100 g of body weight) was used. The 150 μg of human GH/100 g of body weight dose corresponds to the supraphysiologic hormone replacement protocol used by Gronowski and Rotwein(34.Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GH-treated animals were sacrificed at time intervals ranging from 5 min to 4 h following hormone injection, unless indicated otherwise. Rat prolactin (NIDDK, rPRL-B-8-SIAFP) was given intraperitoneally at 12.5 μg/100 g of body weight, and the animals were killed 45 min later. GH and prolactin were obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK. Escherichia coli LPS (serotype 026:B6; Sigma L-2762) was administered to hypophysectomized rats by intraperitoneal injection at 1 mg/150 g of body weight to promote cytokine release, as described(39.Ruff-Jamison S. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Chen K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21933-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were killed 75 min later. Rat liver nuclear proteins were prepared from intact, hypophysectomized, and GH-treated rats by the method described in (40.Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) as modified(18.Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were aliquoted and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage. Cytosolic and microsomal fractions were prepared from the same liver samples using methods already described(18.Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In some cases, the final dialysis step was carried out in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors to facilitate an analysis of the effects of phosphatase treatment (see Fig. 6B, Fig. 7, and Fig. 8).Figure 7:Phosphoprotein phosphatase analysis of liver nuclear Stat 5. Cytosol (A; 40 μg of protein/lane) and the corresponding nuclear extracts (B and C; 10 μg of protein/lane) isolated from hypophysectomized (Hx) male rats that were untreated (lane 1) or were treated with GH (3 μg/100 g of body weight) and then sacrificed 5 min (lane 2), 10 min (lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9), or 15 min (lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10) later were treated with the indicated phosphatases as described under “Materials and Methods.” Samples were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Stat 5 antibody (A and B). C, reprobing of blot shown in B with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. Stat 5-immunoreactive bands are marked 2, 1, and 0 according to whether there are two phosphate groups (band 2, phosphotyrosine + phosphoserine/phosphothreonine), one phosphate group (band 1, phosphotyrosine alone), or no phosphate groups (band 0), as determined by these analyses. Stat 5 band 2 comigrated with a non-tyrosine-phosphorylated band that was detectable in both the cytosol and nuclear samples; this latter protein band remained unchanged in its electrophoretic mobility following CIP treatment (cf. A, upper band in lanes 7 and 8). The faint band marked 1a (B, lanes 5 and 6) corresponds to a phosphoserine- or phosphothreonine-containing Stat 5 that is not tyrosine-phosphorylated (cf. absence of a corresponding band in lanes 5 and 6 in C) and was generated from band 2 by PTP-1B treatment. Band 1 in lanes 3 and 4 was electrophoretically indistinguishable from band 1 in lanes 9 and 10 in B and C, as demonstrated by a mixing experiment (data not shown). The higher ratio of band 2 to band 1 seen lane 4 compared with lane 3 in C suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation precedes serine/threonine phosphorylation. Shown in the first lane in A is nuclear extract (NE; 8 μg of protein) corresponding to the cytosolic sample shown in lane 4. Samples included in this experiment were dialyzed against nuclear extract buffer in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors (see Footnote 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8:Gel mobility shift analysis of Stat 1 and Stat 3 DNA binding activity (SIE probe; A) and liver Stat 5 DNA binding activity (β-casein probe; B) following treatment with phosphoprotein phosphatases.

Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 or with mouse monoclonal anti-Stat antibodies (Transduction Labs). Anti-Stat 1 (S21120) was raised to amino acids 592-731 of human Stat 1, anti-Stat 3 (S21320) to amino acids 1-178 of rat Stat 3, anti-Stat 5 (S21520, lot 3) to amino acids 451-649 of sheep Stat 5, and anti-Stat 6 (S25420) to amino acids 1-272 of human IL-4-activated Stat. The anti-Stat 5 antibody was shown to react with mouse Stat 5a and to cross-react partially with mouse Stat 5b when the latter two cDNAs, kindly provided by Dr. Alice Mui(41.Mui A.L.F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. By contrast, anti-Stat 5 antibody C-17 (Santa Cruz sc-835x), used for the gel mobility supershift analysis described below, was shown to be specific for mouse Stat 5b. ( 2S.-H. Park and D. J. Waxman, unpublished experiments.) Protein samples were fractionated through 10% polyacrylamide gels (10-25 μg of nuclear extract protein/lane), and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose overnight at 4°C. Blots were preincubated for 1 h at 37°C with TBS blocking buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.9% NaCl) and then incubated for an additional 1 h at room temperature in TBS containing monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:3000) or the specific anti-Stat antibodies (1:2000) described above. After washing 3 × 5 min in TST buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), blots were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000; Amersham Corp.) and then washed in a high Tween buffer (0.3% Tween 20, 10 mM potassium Pi (pH 7.4), 0.9% NaCl; 1 × 15 min) followed by a TST wash (1 × 15 min). Antibody binding was detected on x-ray film by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Corp. To reprobe with another primary antibody, nitrocellulose blots were stripped by incubation in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), for 30 min at 50°C and then rinsed 3 × 10 min in TST before reblocking in TBS and reprobing. Results presented in the individual figures are based on grayscale scans of portions of the x-ray films of each blot. Scans were obtained using a Cannon IX-4015 scanner and Ofoto scanning software. Liver nuclear protein, 5 μg dissolved in 5 μl of NED (nuclear extract dialysis) buffer (25 mM Hepes (pH 7.6 at 4°C), 40 mM KCl, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol), was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 9 μl of gel mobility shift buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 4% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaCl). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (1 μl, 10 fmol), 32P-end-labeled on one strand using T4 polynucleotide kinase, was then added and further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. An additional 10-min incubation was carried out in the presence of anti-Stat antibody prior to the addition of the 32P-labeled DNA probe for the gel mobility supershift analysis. Mouse monoclonal anti-ISGF3 antibody (Transduction Labs G16920), rabbit polyclonal anti-Stat 3 antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz sc-482x), and anti-Stat 5 antibody C-17 were used for Stat 1, Stat 3, and Stat 5 supershift analysis, respectively. Where indicated, anti-Stat 3C antibody, kindly provided by Drs. Z. Zhong and J. Darnell, Jr. (Rockefeller University)(42.Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar), was used for supershift analysis. This latter antibody supershifted SIE complexes formed by both Stat 3-Stat 3 homodimers and Stat 1-Stat 3 heterodimers, whereas anti-Stat 3 antibody C-20 preferentially supershifted the Stat 3-Stat 3 homodimers (see Fig. 3D). Samples were electrophoresed at room temperature through nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (5.5% acrylamide, 0.07% bisacrylamide for the SIE probe; 4% acrylamide, 0.05% bisacrylamide for the β-casein probe; see below) in 0.5 × TBE buffer (44.5 mM Tris, 44.5 mM boric acid, 5 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)) for 2.5 h at 100 V using a standard method after a 30-min pre-electrophoresis step under identical conditions. In some cases, the electrophoresis time was increased to 3-3.5 h, resulting in the elution of unbound probe from the bottom of the gel, in order to increase the resolution of the gel shift complexes. The DNA probes used for gel mobility shift studies were as follows: (a) rat β-casein probe (Stat 5/mammary gland factor response element, nucleotides −101 to −80), 5′-GGA-CTT-CTT-GGA-ATT-AAG-GGA-3′ (sense strand, oligonucleotide ON-257) and 5′-gTC-CCT-TAA-TTC-CAA-GAA-GTCC-3′ (antisense strand, ON-258); and (b) SIE probe, 5′-gtc-gaC-ATT-TCC-CGT-AAA-TCg-tcga-3′ (sense strand, ON-242) and 5′-gac-GAT-TTA-CGG-GAA-ATG-tcg-ac-3′ (antisense strand, ON-243). Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides used for competition experiments at a 50-fold molar excess over 32P-labeled probe were as follows: SIE mutant oligonucleotide (sc-2536), GAS/ISRE consensus oligonucleotide (sc-2537), and GAS/ISRE mutant oligonucleotide (sc-2538) (obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and rat liver Spi 2.1 GH response element II, 5′-promoter at nucleotides −136 to −117(43.Le Cam A.

Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from commercial sources and were gel-purified prior to use. Treatment of cytosolic and liver nuclear extracts with phosphoprotein phosphatases was carried out as follows. Protein samples (25 μg in a total volume of 70 μl) were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-specific phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (0.8 units; Upstate Biotechnology 14-111) or 1 (PP1) (0.8 units; Upstate Biotechnology 14-110), with phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B) (10 μl of enzyme containing 1 μg of fusion protein-agarose bead conjugate; Upstate Biotechnology 14-109), or with the general phosphatase CIP (20 units; Promega M1821) in the presence of 25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 50 μM CaCl2 containing 25 μg of bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mM ZnCl2. Control samples included the specific phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (100 nM for PP2A and 1 μM for PP1), sodium orthovanadate (0.1 mM for PTP-1B), or EDTA (0.1 mM for CIP). Following incubation with the phosphatases, phosphatase inhibitors were added to block further dephosphorylation during sample analysis. Western immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Stat antibodies and gel mobility assay for Stat-DNA complex activity using the SIE probe (Stat 1 and Stat 3) or a rat β-casein promoter probe (liver Stat 5) were then carried out. Intermittent plasma GH pulses, which occur in adult male rats, stimulate liver Stat 5 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation to high levels, while the more continuous plasma GH profile of adult female rats desensitizes hepatocytes, resulting in low Stat 5 tyrosine phosphorylation and little or no liver Stat 5 protein in the nucleus(18.Waxman D.J.

Upstream from the ERE, a DNA sequence (−418 to −378, FP1) was selectively protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear extracts from endometrial and mammary gland cell lines. In this report, using the electrophoresis mobility shift assay, site-directed mutagenesis, and DNA methylation interference analyses, we show that three different nuclear proteins bind to the FP1 region (C1, C2, and C3 sites). The nuclear receptor, COUP-TF, binds to the C2 site. Mutations in the C1 binding region abolish C1 complex formation and reduce estrogen-dependent transcription from the lactoferrin ERE. When the imperfect ERE of the lactoferrin gene is converted to a perfect palindromic structure, the enhancing effect of the C1 binding element for estrogen responsiveness was abolished. We isolated a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone from an RL95-2 expression library that encodes the C1 site-binding protein. The encoded polypeptide maintains 99% amino acid identity with the previously described orphan nuclear receptor hERR1.

Transcriptional activation of this IRF-1 promoter segment by IFNs requires a palindromic GAS element, the IR element, which lies about 110 bases upstream of the transcription start site. IFN-inducible transcription factors containing STAT1 bind to the IR element in vitro.In this report, we demonstrate the formation of a novel IFN-α-inducible DNA-binding factor consisting of STAT1 and STAT2. Although this factor does not include p48, the level of p48 protein does affect the balance between the novel factor and ISGF3. We propose that transcriptional activation of the IRF-1 gene involves interaction of the IR element with either a STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer or a STAT1 homodimer.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and IFNs2fTGH and mutant cell lines derived from it have been described elsewhere(21.Pellegrini S.

Briefly, complementary oligonucleotides, end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Boeringer Mannheim) and [γ-32P]ATP, were annealed by slow cooling.

At least three IFN-α-inducible DNA-binding factors were detected by using an IR element as probe (Fig. 1A, lane 2). We designate these complexes A, B, and C, from the slowest mobility to the fastest, respectively. The intensity of complex C was at least five times higher than that of complex A, and the intensity of complex B was weakest. Similar results were obtained using an Fcγ GAS probe. ( 2X. Li, S. Leung, and G. R. Stark, unpublished observations.) We used antibodies against STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 to analyze the components present in these complexes. Complex C, which migrated similarly to the IFN-γ-induced GAF (Fig. 1A, lane 3), was supershifted only by an antibody against STAT1 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Complex B was supershifted by antibodies against STAT1 or STAT3 (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 4). Complex A was supershifted by antibodies against STAT1 or STAT2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). A control antibody against WAF-1 did not supershift any of these complexes (Fig. 1B, lane 5). (The control antibody did generate nonspecific protein-DNA complexes near the top of the gel.) The composition of complexes A, B, and C was analyzed further by comparing 2fTGH and mutant cell extracts. No complex was detected with an extract of U3A cells, which lack STAT12, and complex A was not detected in IFN-α-treated U6A cells, which lack STAT2 (Fig. 1A, lane 5). Complex C was barely detectable in IFN-α-treated U6A cells (Fig. 1A, lane 5), probably due to the weak activation of STAT1 in the absence of STAT2(23.Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that complex C contains STAT1 homodimers, complex B contains STAT3-STAT1 heterodimers, and complex A contains STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers. To establish that complex A does not contain p48, we performed an EMSA with an extract of IFN-α-treated U2A cells, which lack p48 (Fig. 1C). Complex A was still detectable in these cells, showing that STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers can bind to DNA in the absence of p48. The bands formed with the U2A extract were less intense than those formed with 2fTGH extracts (Fig. 1B) for an unknown reason, possibly clonal variation.STAT1-STAT2 Heterodimers and STAT1 homodimers Are Both Transcriptional Activators of the IRF-1 GeneThe IR element of the IRF-1 promoter binds IFN-α-inducible factors containing STAT1 and is important for the transcriptional activation of IRF-1 in response to IFNs(18.Sims S.H.

Previously, we showed that IFN-α induction of IRF-1 in U6A cells (lacking STAT2) was greatly reduced(23.Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now manipulated the levels of the heterodimers and homodimers, to evaluate their roles in the activation of IRF-1 transcription. To evaluate the heterodimers, we used a U6A clone, transfected with a STAT2 expression construct, that expresses about 10 times more STAT2 protein than 2fTGH cells.2 Parental 2fTGH cells have much less heterodimer than homodimer (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The high level of STAT2 in the transfected U6A clone greatly increases the formation of heterodimers and decreases the formation of homodimers in response to IFN-α (Fig. 2, lane 2). The ratio of heterodimers to homodimers in this clone changes to 5:1 compared to a ratio of about 1:5 in parental 2fTGH cells (Fig. 1A, lane 2), a 25-fold increase. IFN-α-induced IRF-1 expression was restored in this clone (Fig. 3, U6A/STAT2). The results suggest that the STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer can function as a transcriptional activator of the IRF-1 gene.Figure 2:Alteration of the relative amounts of STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers and STAT1 homodimers in U6A cells.

Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the homodimer in the absence of the heterodimer, we expressed in U6A cells a chimeric protein, designated N2, in which the N-terminal 305 amino acids of STAT1 are replaced by the N-terminal 315 amino acids of STAT2. We observed only STAT1 homodimers in IFN-α-treated U6A/N2 extracts (Fig. 2, lane 5). In response to IFN-α, IRF-1 induction was restored in U6A/N2 cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that STAT1 homodimers are also transcriptional activators of the IRF-1 gene. The N2 protein and endogenous STAT1 were both phosphorylated in response to IFN-α in U6A/N2 cells.2 However, we did not detect co-precipitation of N2 with STAT1 in these cells,2 suggesting that N2 dimerizes poorly with STAT1. Furthermore, complex C in U6A/N2 extracts is not likely to contain N2/STAT1 heterodimers or N2/STAT1 heterodimers because an amount of an antibody against N-terminal STAT2 that could supershift all of complex A in 2fTGH cells (Fig. 1B, lane 3) showed only minimal effect on complex C in U6A/N2 cells.2Although both STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers and STAT1 homodimers can activate IRF-1, it is likely that the heterodimer is more potent. Upon IFN-α treatment, the level of homodimers in U6A/N2 cells was about 10-fold higher than the level of heterodimers in U6A/STAT2 cells (Fig. 2; compare complex C in lane 5 to complex A in lane 2). However, induction of IRF-1 gene expression was stronger in U6A/STAT2 cells than in U6A/N2 cells 4 h after IFN-α treatment (Fig. 3, A and B; compare U6A/STAT2 to U6A/N2). Although there are more STAT1 homodimers than STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers in IFN-α-treated 2fTGH cells (Fig. 1A, lane 2), the heterodimers may still contribute to the activation of IRF-1 gene expression, since they are more potent.The Acidic Domain at the C Terminus of STAT2 Is Required for IFN-α-induced IRF-1 TranscriptionThe critical role of STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers in IFN-α-induced IRF-1 expression is supported by studies with a series of C-terminal STAT2 deletion mutants. The STAT2 C terminus contains a domain rich in acidic amino acids, believed to be important to transcriptional activation(27.Fu X. Schindler C. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7840-7843Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Recently, we expressed a series of C-terminal STAT2 deletion mutants in U6A cells and showed that the acidic domain is important for ISGF3-mediated transcriptional activation in response to IFN-α(29.Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A U6A clone expressing full-length STAT2 (851 amino acids) was compared to clones expressing similar levels of STAT2 deletions missing 20 (Δ831 construct), 39 (Δ812 construct), or 51 (Δ800 construct) C-terminal amino acids. In all of these clones, the IFN-α-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 was restored to normal levels (29.Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and heterodimers of STAT1 and the truncated STAT2 proteins (Fig. 4, complex A) and STAT1 homodimers (Fig. 4, complex C) were formed. Interestingly, IRF-1 gene induction could not be restored by STAT2 mutants with deletion of 51 amino acids (Fig. 5, Δ800) or more. At least three factors contribute to this result. First, the STAT1-Δ800-STAT2 heterodimers are likely to be inherently defective in transcriptional activation. Second, the small amounts of STAT1 homodimers formed in these clones will activate IRF-1 transcription only inefficiently. Third, the inactive heterodimers are likely to compete with the homodimers for IR elements. In summary, the segment between amino acids 851 and 800 is important for IRF-1 gene transcription mediated by the STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers and also for the transcriptional activity of STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers bound to p48 (ISGF3)(29.Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Figure 4:STAT2 proteins with C-terminal truncations form heterodimers with STAT1.

In U2A cells (lacking p48), ISGF3 was not formed in response to IFN-α (Fig. 6A, lane 4), but the heterodimer was detected with the IR element probe (Fig. 6B, lane 4). When p48 was overexpressed in U2A cells, the ISGF3 complex was formed (Fig. 6A, lane 2), but the heterodimer (complex A) was not detected, even when twice the amount of extract was used (Fig. 6B, lane 2), suggesting that the level of STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers is affected by the level of p48. Formation of complex C (STAT1 homodimers) was not affected in p48-transfected U2A cells.Figure 6:Alteration of the ratio of ISGF3 to STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers by p48. A, EMSA was performed using extracts of either U2A or p48-complemented U2A cells, untreated(-) or treated with IFN-α for 15 min. An ISRE probe from the 9-27 gene was used (GGAAATAGAAACT)(5.Reid L.E. Brasnett A.H. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Gewert D.R. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The position of ISGF3 is indicated by arrows. We see two bands, corresponding to the 91- and 84-kDa forms of STAT1. B, the same extracts were assayed with an IR probe (see “Materials and Methods”). To show critically that complex A was not present in the IFN-α-treated U2A/p48 cells, the amount of extract was doubled in that lane. Complexes A and C are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe performed EMSA with various GAS elements (1.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) and an extract of U6A/STAT2 cells; only the IR and Fcγ GAS elements were found to bind STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers, suggesting that the heterodimers probably prefer GAS elements with the core sequence TTCCC(A/C)GAA. We did not identify a GAS element specific for heterodimers since STAT1 homodimers were detected with the same probes. It will be interesting to determine the optimal GAS sequence for binding heterodimers by use of the polymerase chain reaction(32.Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, the optimal sequence for STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers may be no more specific than the optimal sequence for STAT1-STAT3 heterodimers, which also binds to STAT1 homodimers with high affinity(32.Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar).STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers form in U2A cells in the absence of p48. It is likely that p48 binds to preformed heterodimers to form ISGF3, so that the level of p48 can influence the steady-state amount of heterodimer. The expression of p48 is usually low in most cell types but can be induced by IFN-γ. Thus, the heterodimer may be directed either to form ISGF3 or to bind to a selected set of GAS elements depending on the availability of p48, which thus may modulate the response to IFN-α in an IFN-γ-dependent manner.We manipulated the amounts of STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers and STAT1 homodimers in transfected U6A cells to reveal that both can function to stimulate transcription of the IRF-1 gene in response to IFN-α. However, a small amount of heterodimer is sufficient to promote a high level of IRF-1 induction, revealing that this novel factor is a potent transcriptional activator. The STAT1 homodimers induced by IFN-α activate IRF-1 transcription less strongly. Our results suggest that, depending on the level of p48, STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers can play a major role in activating IRF-1 transcription in response to IFN-α.We showed by deletion analysis that the acidic domain of STAT2 is important for the transcriptional activation of the IRF-1 gene. The same region is also important for transcriptional activation of ISRE-containing genes(29.Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is possible that the acidic domain of STAT2 may interact with the same basic transcription factor(s) at the start sites of these genes. We detected truncated heterodimers and STAT1 homodimers in U6A cells transfected with a series of STAT2 proteins carrying C-terminal deletions and found that decreased IRF-1 induction correlated with shortening of the STAT2 acidic domain. The STAT1 homodimers formed in these cells are insufficient to induce IRF-1 transcription, probably because they fail to compete effectively with the defective heterodimers.Although a STAT1-STAT3 heterodimer (complex B) was detected using the IR element probe, this species is unlikely to be important for IFN-α-mediated IRF-1 gene expression because the amount of complex B is very low. The role of STAT3 in the IFN-α signaling pathway remains unclear.In summary, we have demonstrated an alternative transcriptional activation pathway mediated by a novel transcription factor that is likely to be a STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer. The heterodimer binds to the IR element of the IRF-1 gene and the GAS element of the Fcγ gene and is a potent transcriptional activator of the IRF-1 gene. Since the IRF-1 protein has been found to be a tumor suppressor (33.Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and a mediator of apoptosis(34.Tamura T. Ishihara M. Lamphier M.S. Tanaka N. Oishi I. Aizawa S. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Taki S. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1995; 376: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), the STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer may play an important role in the antiproliferative response mediated by type I IFNs.

https://openalex.org/W2022051845,"The expression of an oncogenic rasHa gene in epidermal keratinocytes stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of protein kinase C δ and inhibits its enzymatic activity (Denning, M. F., Dlugosz, A. A., Howett, M. K., and Yuspa, S. H.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26079-26081). Keratinocytes expressing an activated rasHa gene secrete transforming growth factor α (TGFα) and have an altered response to differentiation signals involving protein kinase C (PKC). Because the neoplastic phenotype of v-rasHa expressing keratinocytes can be partially mimicked in vitro by chronic treatment with TGFα and the G protein activator aluminum fluoride (AlF-4), we determined if TGFα or AlF-4 could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Treatment of primary keratinocyte cultures for 4 days with TGFα induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ, whereas AlF-4 only slightly stimulated PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. The PKCδ that was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to TGFα had reduced activity compared with the nontyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ. Treatment of keratinocytes expressing a normal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with TGFα or epidermal growth factor for 5 min induced PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. This acute epidermal growth factor treatment did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in keratinocytes isolated from waved-2 mice that have a defective epidermal growth factor receptor. In addition, the level of PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in v-rasHa-transduced keratinocytes from EGFR null mice was substantially lower than in v-rasHa transduced wild type cells, suggesting that activation of the EGFR is important for PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in ras transformation. However, purified EGFR did not phosphorylate recombinant PKCδ in vitro, whereas members of the Src family (c-Src, c-Fyn) and membrane preparations from keratinocytes did. Furthermore, clearing c-Src or c-Fyn from keratinocyte membrane lysates decreased PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation, and c-Src and c-Fyn isolated from keratinocytes treated with TGFα had increased kinase activity. Acute or chronic treatment with TGFα did not induce significant PKCδ translocation in contrast to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which induced both translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. This suggests that TGFα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ results from the activation of a tyrosine kinase rather than physical association of PKCδ with a membrane-anchored tyrosine kinase. Taken together, these results indicate that PKCδ activity is inhibited by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGFR-mediated signaling and activation of a member of the Src kinase family may be the proximal tyrosine kinase acting on PKCδ in keratinocytes. The expression of an oncogenic rasHa gene in epidermal keratinocytes stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of protein kinase C δ and inhibits its enzymatic activity (Denning, M. F., Dlugosz, A.

INTRODUCTIONThe protein kinase C (PKC) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CEGFepidermal growth factorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateEGFREGF receptorTGFtransforming growth factor.) family of serine/threonine protein kinases is a central component of phospholipase-coupled growth factor receptor signaling pathways(1.Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities of several PKC isoforms are regulated by the allosteric activators diacylglycerol and Ca2+, which are elevated in response to growth factor receptor activation(2.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar). The G protein Ras is also a component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). In addition, PKCα can directly affect the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by phosphorylating and stimulating the autokinase activity of Raf-1(3.Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Ras can act either as a regulator or effector of PKC function, but the molecular mechanisms involved are unclear(4.Lacal J.C. Fleming T.P. Warren B.S. Blumberg P.M. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell.

Neoplastic mouse keratinocytes expressing an activated rasHa allele have increases in phosphatidylinositol turnover, diacylglycerol levels, and calcium-dependent PKC activity(9.Lee E. Punnonen K.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6413-6420PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PKCα, the only calcium-dependent PKC isoform expressed in keratinocytes, is correlated with the expression of granular layer differentiation markers in normal keratinocytes and in v-rasHa expressing keratinocytes, where granular layer differentiation markers are up-regulated(10.Dlugosz A.A.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar). Keratinocytes expressing a v-rasHa oncogene also have decreased Ca2+-independent PKC activity and have a block in their ability to commit to Ca2+ and TPA-induced terminal differentiation(10.Dlugosz A.A.

The block in differentiation response may be due to the tyrosine phosphorylation and inactivation of PKCδ because the kinase inhibitor staurosporine blocks PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation and induces terminal differentiation of neoplastic keratinocytes(5.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, v-rasHa transformation of keratinocytes up-regulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand expression and induces the secretion of transforming growth factor α (TGFα)(15.Dlugosz A.A.

Several studies have indicated that increased secretion of TGFα can substitute for rasHa mutations in the altered response to differentiation signals (17.Cheng C. Tennenbaum T. Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. Yuspa S.H. Dlugosz A.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 317-327PubMed Google Scholar) and can initiate skin carcinogenesis(18.Vassar R. Hutton M.E. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell.

We demonstrate that TGFα is able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ resulting in inhibition of its activity. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in intact cells requires a functional EGFR, it is not directly mediated by EGFR and may involve a member of the Src kinase family. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ by the EGFR pathway demonstrates a perturbation of PKC signaling by TGFα that may contribute to the process of neoplastic transformation in epithelial cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPurified EGFR was from Promega, and Src and Fyn kinases were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. PKC isozymes were produced in SF9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system as described previously (20.Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F.

The phenotype of the wa-2/wa-2 mice were distinguished from the +/+ and +/wa-2 mice by the curly whiskers observed in the wa-2/wa-2 newborn mice (22.Luetteke N.C. Phillips H.K. Qiu T.H. Copeland N.G.

The keratinocytes were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 8% Chelex-treated (Bio-Rad) fetal bovine serum with the final Ca2+ concentration adjusted to 0.05 mM as described(23.Hennings H.

After reaching approximately 80% confluence, the cells were cultured without keratinocyte growth factor for 3-4 days before harvesting. For the introduction of a v-rasHa gene into cells, keratinocytes were exposed to 4 μg/ml polybrene in the absence or the presence of a replication-defective retrovirus containing the v-rasHa gene and cultured 4-6 days before use(24.Roop D.R.

The immunoblots were incubated with antibodies specific for PKCδ at a 1:500 dilution (Calbiochem) or phosphotyrosine at 1 μg/ml (clone 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Immunoblotted proteins were detected using the Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagents (DuPont NEN) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) at 1:5000 dilution. The immunoblots were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer.Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously(5.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into immunoprecipitation lysis buffer, and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and either 2.5 μg anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or 0.5-1 μl of anti-PKCδ antibody. The c-Src and c-Fyn immunoprecipitations were performed with 2 μg of antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (sc-19 and sc-16 respectively) and 50 μl protein A-Sepharose from Sigma. For some phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations, an agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. was used. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) and boiled in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer(25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar).In Vitro Kinase AssaysTyrosine kinase reactions were performed in a volume of 20-30 μl containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μM NaVO3, and 1 mM NaF. PKC isozymes from baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells were included as substrates for either Src or Fyn kinase (10 units) or keratinocyte membranes (25 μg of protein). The keratinocyte membranes were prepared from normal primary keratinocytes by scraping the cells into hypotonic lysis buffer (1 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, and 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and spinning at approximately 50 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then spun in a microcentrifuge for 20 min, and the membrane pellet resuspended in assay buffer and used as a source of tyrosine kinase. The reactions were started by adding 25 μM ATP and incubated for 10 min at 30°C. Tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. For the Src and Fyn immunoprecipitation kinase assays, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer, twice with assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mM MnCl2, and 5 mM MgCl2), and incubated in 30 μl of assay buffer containing 10 μM ATP for 10 min at 30°C. The Sepharose beads were washed once in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.PKC assays of tyrosine-phosphorylated and nontyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ were performed as described previously with minor modifications (5.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary keratinocytes were cultured in 10 ng/ml TGFα for 4 days to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of a fraction (~50%) of PKCδ. Lysates were prepared (n = 3) and immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for 2.5 h. The phosphotyrosine-cleared lysates were taken for immunoprecipitation of nontyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ. Both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated samples were immunoprecipitated for PKCδ overnight in the presence of 30 mMp-nitrophenylphosphate to release phosphotyrosine containing proteins from the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer and twice in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 25 μl of Tris-HCl and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. PKC assays were performed on the immunoprecipitated PKCδ in the presence or the absence of 1 μM TPA as described by Nakadate et al.(26.Nakadate T. Jeng A.Y. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1541-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) except that the PKC substrate peptide [ser25] (Life Technologies, Inc.) was the phosphate acceptor, and 20%/80% phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine vesicles were the phospholipid. After the enzyme reaction, the agarose beads were spun, and 30 μl of supernatant was spotted for scintillation counting. The PKCδ remaining on the beads was boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by anti-PKCδ immunoblot to correct for differences in the amount of PKCδ in the assay.RESULTSTGFα Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PKCδ in Normal KeratinocytesBecause treatment of primary keratinocyte cultures with TGFα and the nonspecific G protein activator AlF-4 elicits many phenotypic changes characteristic of v-rasHa transformation(9.Lee E. Punnonen K. Cheng C. Glick A. Dlugosz A. Yuspa S.H. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 2367-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we examined whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was also induced by these pharmacological agents. Culturing primary keratinocytes in the presence of 10 ng/ml TGFα for 4 days induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ (27-fold), whereas a 4-day AlF-4 (1 μM AlCl3 and 1 mM NaF) treatment induced tyrosine phosphorylation only slightly (Fig. 1A). The combined treatment of TGFα and AlF-4 resulted in a more than additive increase in PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation (48-fold).Because TGFα was a more effective inducer of PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation than AlF-4, we further analyzed TGFα-induced PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. The kinetics of TGFα-induced PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation were biphasic (Fig. 1B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was increased approximately 8-fold after a 5-min TGFα treatment (10 ng/ml), returned toward basal levels by 1-2 h, and increased again from 4 and 6 h (9-11-fold), remaining elevated (4-fold) even after 24 h of TGFα treatment. The total levels of PKCδ did not change appreciably during this time. Acute and chronic treatment with EGF also induced PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation (see Fig. 3A).Figure 3:Mutant alleles of the EGFR inhibit PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. A, primary keratinocytes were isolated from mice having a wild type EGFR (BALB/c, +/+ and +/wa-2) and from waved-2 mice homozygous for the mutant EGFR (wa-2/wa-2). The keratinocytes were cultured and infected with v-rasHa for 5 days (v-ras), treated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 4 days (EGF 4D), or 5 min (EGF 5 M), and PKCδ was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates (750 μg of protein). The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Anti p-Tyr) and anti-PKCδ antibody (Anti PKCδ). Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments. B, primary keratinocytes were isolated from mice having a wild type EGFR (+/+) and from EGFR null mice (-/-). The keratinocytes were initially cultured in 1 ng/ml keratinocyte growth factor for 3 days, switched to unsupplemented medium, and either treated with 100 nM TPA for 10 min (TPA) or infected with v-rasHa for 4 days (ras). Cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (p-Tyr IP), and gel separated total lysates (Total) were immunoblotted for the detection of total PKCδ levels with the anti-PKCδ antibody. A similar result was observed in one additional experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TGFα-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PKCδ Inhibits Its ActivityThe tyrosine-phosphorylated form of PKCδ isolated from rasHa expressing keratinocytes is not activated by the phorbol ester TPA(5.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of TGFα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation on PKCδ enzymatic activity, we performed assays on tyrosine-phosphorylated and nontyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ isolated from keratinocytes treated for 4 days with 10 ng/ml TGFα (Fig. 2). Similar to the results for v-rasHa, the tyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ from TGFα-treated cells had much lower constitutive activity, and TPA caused only a modest increase in activity. In fact, the specific activity of the tyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ assayed in the presence of 1 μM TPA was substantially lower than the basal specific activity of the nontyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ.Figure 2:Enzymatic activity of tyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ. Primary keratinocytes were cultured for 4 days in medium containing 10 ng/ml TGFα, and the lysates (n = 3) were immunoprecipitated sequentially with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by an anti-PKCδ antibody. PKC activity was assayed in the tyrosine-phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated fractions in the presence or the absence of 1 μM TPA. For calculating PKCδ-specific activities, the amount of PKCδ in each assay tube was normalized by immunoblotting with an anti-PKCδ antibody. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PKCδ Requires a Functional EGF ReceptorTo determine the contribution of the EGFR to PKCδ modification, keratinocytes were isolated from waved-2 mice that have a mutated EGFR with decreased tyrosine kinase activity(22.Luetteke N.C. Phillips H.K. Qiu T.H. Copeland N.G. Earp H.S. Jenkins N.A. Lee D.C. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was induced by v-rasHa transduction and acute (5 min) or chronic (4 day) treatment with EGF in keratinocytes from BALB/c and phenotypically normal waved-2 mice (+/+ and +/wa-2). However, acute EGF treatment (5 min) did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in the waved-2 keratinocytes (wa-2/wa-2), whereas chronic treatment or v-rasHa did. This is consistent with the defective but not inactive EGFR previously documented in the waved-2 strain(22.Luetteke N.C. Phillips H.K. Qiu T.H. Copeland N.G. Earp H.S. Jenkins N.A. Lee D.C. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was also assessed in keratinocytes isolated from mice harboring a disrupted EGFR gene(21.Threadgill D.W. Dlugosz A.A. Hansen L.A. Tennenbaum T. Lichti U. Yee D. LaMantia C. Mourton T. Herrup K. Harris R.C. Barnard J.A. Yuspa S.H. Coffey R.J. Magnuson T. Science. 1995; 269: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The immunoblots in Fig. 3B show that PKCδ was tyrosine-phosphorylated to a similar extent in both EGFR +/+ and -/- keratinocytes (1200 and 1700% increase, respectively) in response to acute TPA treatment. In contrast, v-rasHa transduction was less effective at inducing PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in the EGFR -/- keratinocytes than in the +/+ cells of the same genetic background (60 and 250% increase, respectively). There was no difference in the amount of total PKCδ between the EGFR +/+ and -/- keratinocytes. These genetic data strongly support the involvement of the EGFR in the v-rasHa-induced PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation.In Vitro Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PKCδ by Src Family Kinases but Not EGFRThe ability of EGF or TGFα to rapidly induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ suggests that the EGFR directly phosphorylates PKCδ. To test this hypothesis, we performed in vitro phosphorylation reactions using EGFR, c-Src, c-Fyn, or a membrane fraction from keratinocytes as the tyrosine kinase and recombinant PKCδ as the phosphate acceptor (Fig. 4A). As detected by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, purified EGFR did not tyrosine phosphorylate PKCδ either in the total reaction mixture or in the PKCδ immunoprecipitate. The EGFR did autophosphorylate, indicating that it was enzymatically active. The tyrosine-phosphorylated band at the M2 of the EGFR in the PKCδ immunoprecipitates has never been detected in PKCδ immunoprecipitates from cell lysates and may associate with PKCδ only under these in vitro conditions. As shown in the PKCδ immunoprecipitate for c-Src and in the total blot for c-Fyn, both kinases were able to tyrosine phosphorylate PKCδ, consistent with previous work demonstrating the phosphorylation of PKCδ by c-Src and c-Fyn in vitro(27.Li W.

Marks F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A crude membrane fraction from normal keratinocytes also mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ (see PKCδ IP in Fig. 4A). Although the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of PKCδ has been previously localized to the membrane fraction(5.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Li W. Yu J.C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell.

In A, recombinant PKCδ from baculovirus-infected Sf-9 insect cells was incubated alone or with purified EGFR, c-Src, c-Fyn, or a membrane fraction from untreated normal keratinocytes in tyrosine kinase assay buffer as indicated. Total reaction mixtures and PKCδ immunoprecipitated from the reactions were analyzed for phosphotyrosine by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.

L., Walseth, T. F., Dargie, P. J., and Lee, H. C.(1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9561-9568; Lee, H. C., and Aarhus, R.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2152-2157). The mechanism of Ca release activated by NAADP and the Ca stores it acts on are different from those of IP and cADPR. In this study we show that photolyzing caged NAADP in intact sea urchin eggs elicits long term Ca oscillations. On the other hand, uncaging threshold amounts of NAADP produces desensitization. In microsomes, this self-inactivation mechanism exhibits concentration and time dependence. Binding studies show that the NAADP receptor is distinct from that of cADPR, and at subthreshold concentrations, NAADP can fully inactivate subsequent binding to the receptor in a time-dependent manner. Thus, the NAADP-sensitive Ca release process has novel regulatory characteristics, which are distinguishable from Ca release mediated by either IP or cADPR. This battery of release mechanisms may provide the necessary versatility for cells to respond to diverse signals that lead to Ca mobilization.

Although the NAADP-sensitive mechanism is functionally distinct from that mediated by cADPR, the same metabolic enzymes that produce cADPR, ADP-ribosyl cyclase and CD38, can also catalyze the synthesis of NAADP from NADP under appropriate conditions(14.Aarhus R.

In this study, we provide conclusive evidence using a caged analog that NAADP is active in live cells. We demonstrate the presence of a specific receptor for NAADP in egg microsomes, and we describe a novel self-regulating mechanism of NAADP. The injection buffer for all experiments contained 18 μM caged NAADP, 10 mM fluo 3, 0.5 M KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 6.7. The injection volumes were 0.5-1.9% of the egg volumes. The final concentrations of caged NAADP in the eggs were 90-342 nM. The procedure for microinjection is as described previously(15.Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The UV photolysis and fluorescence measurements were done using the InCa imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Excitation was from a 300-watt xenon lamp equipped with filters for 340 nm and 485 nm light. During photolysis, the excitation light was alternated between the uncaging (340 nm) and the monitoring (485 nm) wavelength. The duty cycle can be programmed. Details of the setup will be described elsewhere. Caged NAADP was synthesized by derivatizing NAADP with 2-nitrophenethyldiazoethane using a procedure similar to that described for the synthesis of caged cADPR(15.Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The method for purifying and characterizing the product, caged NAADP, will be described elsewhere. Caged NAADP has been designated with a research number (MPR71041) by Molecular Probes, Inc. Ca release measurement and homogenate preparation (1.25% v/v) from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus eggs were as described previously(15.Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All experiments were done at 17°C using 3 μM fluo 3 as the Ca indicator. Microsomes were purified from egg homogenates by Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described previously(1.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

The binding reactions (final volume of 0.1 ml) were initiated by adding microsomes (400-800 μg) to tubes containing [P]NAADP and competitors. After incubating at 4°C for 20-30 min, the microsomes were filtered on GF/C filters and washed 2 times with 3 ml of ice-cold 10% polyethylene glycol in a buffer containing 250 mMN-methylglucamine, 250 mM potassium gluconate, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl, pH adjusted to 7.2 with acetic acid. [P]NAADP was synthesized by phosphorylating [P]NAD with NAD kinase to [P]NADP, which was then converted to [P]NAADP using ADP-ribosyl cyclase as described previously(14.Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). NAD kinase was isolated from sea urchin egg extracts (16.Epel D. Patton C. Wallace R.W. Cheung W.Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 543-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and further purified by a calmodulin affinity column. The purification procedure separates the NAD kinase from a contaminating ATPase, which interferes with the phosphorylation of NAD. To demonstrate conclusively that NAADP is effective in live cells, caged NAADP was synthesized by derivatizing NAADP with 2-nitrophenethyldiazoethane using a procedure similar to that described for the synthesis of caged cADPR(15.Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Caged NAADP had no Ca-releasing activity in egg homogenates and produced no Ca change when injected into intact eggs. Fig. 1A shows that photolyzing with a brief exposure to UV light (340 nm) for 30 s produced a rapid elevation of intracellular Ca as indicated by a 30-fold increase in fluo 3 fluorescence. Thereafter, multiple Ca oscillations occurred over a period of more than 15 min. Similar Ca oscillations were seen in 14 other eggs. Although the exact patterns of oscillations differ between eggs, all 15 exhibited at least two oscillations, and all of them underwent cortical reactions when examined afterward (e.g. the black and white image in Fig. 1B). The Ca changes cannot be due to nonspecific UV exposure since control eggs loaded with a higher concentration of caged ATP and exposed for much longer periods to UV light produced no change in Ca(15.Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The changes also cannot be due to injection artifacts since they were induced by photolysis subsequent to injection. The use of caged NAADP, therefore, provides more convincing evidence than the microinjection protocols used previously in showing that NAADP is effective in live cells(10.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 17.Perez-Terzic C.M. Chini E.N. Shen S.S. Dousa T.P. Clapham D.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). NAADP is also a potent self-desensitizer of the Ca release mechanism as shown in Fig. 1C. By reducing the period of UV uncaging to 10.5 s, a threshold concentration of NAADP was generated, which induced a much smaller Ca response. The egg, nevertheless, became totally desensitized because after as long as 11 min later, photolysis for 45.5 s produced no further change in Ca. In 6 out of 8 eggs, an initial photolysis period of 10-20 s produced a fluo 3 increase of 2.8 ± 0.5 (±S.E.)-fold, and the eggs were strongly desensitized since a subsequent photolysis of 45-231 s elicited a fluo 3 increase of only 0.7 ± 0.3-fold. The self-desensitization can be best demonstrated in egg homogenates. Addition of 4 nM NAADP to microsomes elicited minimal Ca release, but the microsomes failed to respond to subsequent challenge by a saturating concentration of NAADP administered 2 min later (Fig. 2b). A higher subsequent Ca response was seen if the concentration of NAADP used in the pretreatment was reduced to 0.13 nM (Fig. 2a), but it was still less than control without pretreatment (inset of Fig. 2). Indeed, treating the microsomes for 2 min with as low as 0.5 nM NAADP was sufficient to reduce the subsequent Ca response by half (inset of Fig. 2). The self-desensitization is also concentration- and time-dependent. Pretreatment of the homogenates with 1 nM NAADP for 1 min produced significant reduction of the subsequent response to 0.97 μM NAADP (Fig. 3A). After a 10-min pretreatment, the microsomes became totally refractory, but the response to cADPR remained normal as compared with its control without pretreatment. The desensitization was faster and more complete the higher the concentration of NAADP used in the pretreatment (Fig. 3B). For a 10-min pretreatment, 0.25 nM NAADP was sufficient to produce 50% inactivation. It is likely that the inactivation occurs at the receptor level. To demonstrate specific binding, [P]NAADP was synthesized from [P]NADP in the presence of nicotinic acid using the Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase as described previously(14.Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows the specificity of the binding of [P]NAADP to egg microsomes purified by Percoll density centrifugation. The binding was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of NAADP but was not affected by 10 μM NAD, NAAD, cADPR, or cyclic ADP-ribose 2′-phosphate(14.Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). A small inhibition of the binding was seen with 10 μM NADP. This is likely due to the contaminating NAADP in commercial NADP preparations(1.Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), since the inhibition can be removed by purification of the sample by high pressure liquid chromatography (data not shown). Under similar conditions as described in Fig. 4, the binding reached steady state in 2.5 min at 4°C. The saturation of the binding reaction was tested by varying the concentration of radiolabeled NAADP, and maximal specific binding was attained with ligand concentrations higher than about 10 nM (data not shown). The competitive binding studies shown in Fig. 4A were done with the competitors and [P]NAADP added simultaneously. If the microsomes were pretreated with labeled NAADP (2 nM) for various periods before the addition of 100 nM unlabeled NAADP, the displacement of [P]NAADP showed a time-dependent decrease. After 5 min of pretreatment with the label (2 nM), NAADP no longer could displace the binding (Fig. 4B). This is consistent with the time-dependent inactivation of Ca release shown in Fig. 3. It thus appears the binding of subthreshold concentrations of the radioactive label (1 nM) to the microsomes is sufficient to alter the binding site in such a manner that it is no longer accessible to NAADP added afterward. The self-inactivation mechanism described in this study is novel in that it is complete and can be induced by remarkably low concentrations of NAADP. It occurs in live cells and in microsomes. To our knowledge, that subactivating concentrations of ligand can induce desensitization of its receptor, possibly through alteration of the receptor conformation, has not been described previously. Equally novel is the effectiveness of NAADP to release Ca in live eggs. Photolyzing caged NAADP induces a 17.6 ± 2.9-fold (n = 15) increase in fluo 3 fluorescence (cf. Fig. 1), as compared with the 3-6-fold increase induced by either microinjecting cADPR or photolyzing caged cADPR(15.Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). UV photolysis simultaneously releases NAADP from all parts of the eggs, circumventing possible desensitization produced by high local concentrations, which is likely to occur during microinjection (10.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 17.Perez-Terzic C.M. Chini E.N. Shen S.S. Dousa T.P. Clapham D.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). With this procedure, remarkable patterns of long term Ca oscillations are revealed. Because of its self-inactivating property, it is unlikely that NAADP itself is responsible for the long term oscillations. The IP- and/or cADPR-sensitive mechanism may be involved. However, neither cADPR nor IP alone has been reported to be able to generate these types of oscillations in eggs. This suggests that the global elevation of NAADP may specifically set off complex interactions between cADPR- and IP-sensitive Ca stores, resulting in the generation of the long term changes. Indeed, these changes are reminiscent of the multiple Ca oscillations occurring after fertilization, which are correlated with various developmental events(18.Poenie M. Alderton J. Tsien R.Y. Steinhardt R.A. Nature. 1985; 315: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1973532480,"Cytokines induce the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 to express cytokine-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is active only in dimeric form. Because dimerization of purified iNOS subunits requires tetrahydrobiopterin, heme, and L-arginine, we investigated if availability of these factors also influences intracellular assembly of dimeric iNOS. Following exposure to cytokines, iNOS protein was found to accumulate in a near linear manner over 16 h of further culture. In contrast, dimeric iNOS accumulated at a slower rate that continuously decreased during culture, resulting in only 25% of the accumulated iNOS protein being in dimeric form by 16 h. Further experiments argued against dimer instability or L-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin availability as factors limiting iNOS dimer accumulation. Blocking cellular NO synthesis with Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) greatly increased iNOS dimer assembly, indicating NO synthesis limited iNOS dimerization. NO synthesis was found to prevent an increase in soluble heme level that was associated with iNOS induction in Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester-treated cells and also diminished heme insertion into iNOS. These NO-related defects were not reversed by adding heme precursors or hemin to the activated cell cultures. Measurement of iron release from activated cells demonstrated that endogenous NO synthesis substantially increased the release of 59Fe to the medium. These observations suggest that iNOS dimerization is limited to a large extent by iNOS NO synthesis. NO appears to limit intracellular assembly of dimeric iNOS by preventing heme insertion and decreasing heme availability."
https://openalex.org/W2090612456,"Mechanisms mediating tumor cell attachment to the vessel wall under flow conditions are largely unknown. Therefore we analyzed the ability of human melanoma cells to adhere to an immobilized matrix during blood flow and determined the role of platelets in this process. In a parallel plate flow chamber, M21 melanoma cells were suspended in human blood and perfused over a collagen I matrix at a wall shear rate of 50 s⁻1 (2 dynes/cm2) to simulate venous flow over a thrombogenic surface. Melanoma cell interaction with the matrix or blood cells and platelets was monitored and quantified by fluorescence and confocal laser microscopy. Despite their ability to adhere to collagen I under static conditions, M21 cells failed to attach directly to this matrix during blood flow. However, they associated with adherent thrombi, and this resulted in stable melanoma cell arrest. Inhibition of platelet activation or platelet integrin αIIbβ3 function abolished M21 cell attachment. Melanoma cell interaction with thrombi was specific and required β3 integrin expression. M21-L cells which lack integrin αvβ3 failed to associate with thrombi and to arrest during blood flow. Transfection of these cells with the integrin subunits αv or αIIb resulted in variants expressing αvβ3, as in the wild type, or αIIbβ3. Both variants were able to associate with thrombi and to arrest during blood flow. Therefore, β3 integrin-mediated binding to activated platelets represents an efficient mechanism for melanoma cell arrest under flow, and this may contribute to the role of platelets in hematogenous metastasis.

Both variants were able to associate with thrombi and to arrest during blood flow. Therefore, β3 integrin-mediated binding to activated platelets represents an efficient mechanism for melanoma cell arrest under flow, and this may contribute to the role of platelets in hematogenous metastasis. During metastasis, tumor cells disseminate to distant organs via the lymph or the blood stream(1.Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6130-6138PubMed Google Scholar). The arrest of metastasizing tumor cells within the blood stream is a prerequisite for their extravasation. This step is rate-limiting during hematogenous metastasis. In the blood stream, tumor cells are exposed to flow-dependent shear forces, plasma proteins, blood cells, and platelets, all of which may affect tumor cell survival, arrest, and extravasation. Mechanisms which mediate tumor cell arrest involve adhesive interactions of tumor cells with vascular cells and their matrices. A major limitation of our current knowledge of such adhesive interactions originates from the fact that most experimental models used for their study are based on static conditions that are different from those present in the vasculature. Specifically, effects generated by blood flow and the resulting shear forces may critically affect adhesive cell interactions(2.Weiss L. Schmid-Schoenbein G.W. Cell Biophys. 1989; 14: 187-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, the goal of the present study was to analyze tumor cell arrest under flow conditions. This was achieved by using an in vitro model that mimics flow in the vasculature. The system is based on a parallel plate flow chamber combined with confocal laser microscopy and real time recording to document and quantify tumor cell adhesive properties under flow. Tumor cells originating from solid tumors express a variety of adhesion receptors which support their attachment to extracellular matrices present in tissues and the vessel wall, such as collagen, fibrin, fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and von Willebrand factor(3.Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Adhesion receptors also participate in tumor cell interactions with the intact endothelium of the vasculature. This has been demonstrated mostly under static conditions, and many of these adhesion receptors were identified as members of the integrin family including β1 integrins containing the α subunits α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α6, α7, and the αv integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5(4.Ruoslahti E. Giancotti F.G. Cancer Cells. 1989; 1: 119-126PubMed Google Scholar). Static conditions are, however, unlikely to occur in the blood stream. It has been suggested that passive entrapment of tumor cells in narrow capillary vessels may favor their attachment to the endothelium or exposed sites of the subendothelial matrix via adhesion receptors genuine to the tumor cells. Yet shear conditions can reach maximal levels in capillary passages(5.Whitmore R.L. Rheology of the Circulation. Pergamon Press, Oxford1968: 90-133Google Scholar). Therefore, adhesion mechanisms mediating tumor cell attachment to the vessel wall would have to be designed such that adhesive interactions can be established under flow conditions and continuously withstand shear stress. While mechanisms for flow-resistant adhesion have been identified for platelets as well as for leukocytes and enable them to fulfill their specific functions during hemostasis and inflammation(6.Ruggeri Z.M. Ware J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 7.Smith C.W. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar), it is yet unknown whether metastasizing tumor cells possess similar mechanisms. It has long been thought that platelets may assist hematogenous dissemination of metastasizing cells(8.Jamieson G.A. Bastida E. Ordinas A. MacIintyre D.E. Gordon J.L. Platelets in Biology and Pathology. III. Elsevier/North Holland, Amsterdam1987: 161-189Google Scholar, 9.Honn K.V. Tang D.G. Chen Y.Q. Semin. Thromb.

Perhaps the most convincing evidence is the inhibition of metastasis by experimental thrombocytopenia shown for a variety of tumors(11.Gasic G.J. Gasic T.B. Galanti N. Johnson T. Murphy S. Int. J. Cancer. 1973; 11: 704-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 12.Kimoto M. Ando K. Koike S. Matsumoto T. Jibu T. Moriya H. Kanegasak S. Clin. Exp.

Invest. 1988; 81: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that tumor cells may interact with platelets and thereby acquire specific mechanisms which mediate platelet anchorage under flow. To test this hypothesis we selected a human melanoma cell model, because melanoma is the most malignant form of skin cancer characterized by a high frequency of metastasis during early stages of the disease. M21 melanoma cells suspended in human blood failed to attach directly to a collagen I matrix under flow, even at a relatively low wall shear rate of 50 s⁻1 (2 dynes/cm2) which corresponds to venous blood flow(5.Whitmore R.L. Rheology of the Circulation. Pergamon Press, Oxford1968: 90-133Google Scholar). However, the melanoma cells were able to associate with attached platelets that had become activated and engaged in thrombus formation due to their initial matrix contact. The interaction between melanoma cells and platelets resulted in stable melanoma cell arrest during continued blood flow. The association between melanoma cells and platelets was not due to passive entrapment but was identified as a specific, receptor-mediated interaction involving β3 integrin function on both the melanoma cells and the platelets. Thus, our results demonstrate that melanoma cell arrest to a matrix during blood flow can be mediated by their specific interaction with platelets which establish the initial matrix contact.

M21-L4 cells derived from M21-L cells were transfected with αv to reconstitute αv integrin expression. M21-L4 cells and the adhesive functions of M21, M21-L, and M21-L4 cells under static conditions were described earlier(19.Felding-Habermann B. Mueller B.M. Romerdahl C.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 2018-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). M21-LIIb cells were generated by transfecting M21-L cells with a full-length cDNA encoding human αIIb cloned into vector DNA pcDNA1neo (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) using the Lipofectin protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). In brief, subconfluent adherent cells were incubated with 2 μg of cDNA and 40 μg of Lipofectin for 12 h and allowed to recover for 48 h before selection in neomycin for 3 wk at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Neomycin-resistant cells were expanded and enriched for αIIbβ3 expression by repetitive fluorescence-activated cell sorting using αIIβ3 complex specific mAb LJ-CP8. All cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM pyruvate, and tested free from mycoplasma during these studies. Human blood was drawn by venipuncture from healthy volunteers into PPACK (H-D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride, Bachem Bioscience Inc., Philadelphia, PA) at 50 nM final concentration. PPACK inhibits thrombin function and was chosen as anticoagulant because it does not interfere with platelet activation or cation-dependent platelet aggregation. In cases where inhibition of platelet activation was desired, blood was drawn into PPACK plus 20 nM final concentration of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Human blood containing 50 nM PPACK and 5 units/ml ADP scavenger apyrase (Sigma) was centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min at room temperature. Plasma was removed and replaced with an equivalent volume of HEPES-Tyrode buffer, pH 6.5 (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.4 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM NaHCO3, and 5 mM dextrose) containing 1 unit/ml apyrase. The resuspended blood cells were centrifuged again at 2250 × g for 10 min. Washing of the blood cells was repeated two more times using HEPES-Tyrode buffer as above but containing only 0.2 unit/ml apyrase and finally no apyrase. The final pellet was reconstituted in HEPES-Tyrode buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mM CaCl2(20.Goto S. Salomon D.R. Ikeda Y. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23352-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). A simple staining system was developed to distinguish melanoma cells from blood cells or platelets and to identify the cellular components of attached heteroaggregates. Melanoma cells were suspended in plain DMEM at 2 × 106 cells/ml and stained with hydroethidine (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) at 20 μg/ml final concentration for 30 min at 37°C and then washed twice to remove excess dye. Hydroethidine intercalates into the DNA resulting in red fluorescent labeling of the cells. Prestained melanoma cells were suspended in human blood containing 10 μM mepacrine (quinancrine dihydrochloride; Sigma) which concentrates in cell cytoplasmic granules and platelet dense granules. Thus all cells and platelets in the suspension acquired a green fluorescence while the melanoma cells could be identified by their unique red fluorescence. Filter settings at 488/515 nm (excitation/emission) for mepacrine and at 543/590 nm for hydroethidine allowed differential detection of melanoma cells in the presence of whole blood. The hydroethidine signal was detected at lower intensity with the mepacrine filter settings; however, the hydroethidine filter settings almost completely excluded the mepacrine signal. Therefore, melanoma cells could be identified within heterogenous cellular structures. Erythrocytes were not visible in the fluorescent field due to the quenching effect of hemoglobin. Neither of the dyes, hydroethidine or mepacrine, impaired cell adhesive functions as was tested in stationary assays. Suspensions of fibrillar collagen I (bovine Achilles tendon, Sigma) were prepared as described earlier(21.Folie B.J. McIntire L.V. Lasslo A. Blood. 1988; 72: 1393-1400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 2 mg/ml collagen I from bovine Achilles tendon (Sigma) was suspended in 0.5 M acetic acid, pH 2.8, homogenized at room temperature for 3 h, centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min, and stored at 4°C. For matrix preparation, glass coverslips (no. 1, 24 × 50 mm, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 200 μl of collagen suspension in a humid atmosphere for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were rinsed three times with DMEM prior to assembly of the flow chamber. The flow chamber consisted of the matrix-coated glass coverslip as the bottom which was placed onto a metal frame. A rectangular silicon gasket (250 μm thick) was placed onto the coverslip before mounting a 37 × 65 × 12-mm acrylic block as the top of the flow chamber. This block was secured to the frame by four screws and contained two 27-mm long and 4-mm wide drillings used as chamber inlet and outlet, respectively. The inner dimensions of the flow chamber were 14 × 28 × 0.2-mm(22.Hubbell J.A. McIntire L.V. Biomaterials. 1986; 7: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The chamber was filled with DMEM and connected to a pump system via medium-filled silicon tubings before placing it onto the heated and enclosed stage of the microscope. All flow experiments were carried out at 37°C. Based on the design of the flow chamber, a given flow rate generated a corresponding wall shear rate which was constant throughout the chamber. The relationship between the wall shear rate (∂v/∂z) (velocity gradient evaluated at the wall) and shear stress is ∂v/∂z = τ/μ, where v is the velocity of the fluid, z is the distance to the surface, τ is the fluid shear stress, and μ is the fluid viscosity. The shear rate (∂v/∂z) has the dimension s⁻1(5.Whitmore R.L. Rheology of the Circulation. Pergamon Press, Oxford1968: 90-133Google Scholar). This unit was used throughout the present studies to address the flow conditions used in the experiments. The microscopy system used was specifically designed to visualize, record, and quantify the dynamics of cell-cell and cell matrix interactions during flow experiments. It consisted of an inverted microscope equipped with fluorescence and confocal laser modes (Axiovert 135, LSM 410, Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany) and was controlled by a computer using LSM software (Zeiss). For real time analysis, cell adhesive events were monitored and recorded by a video camera using the fluorescence mode. To examine the three-dimensional topography of adherent cellular structures, optical sections of the specimens along the z axis were acquired using the confocal laser mode. Images were captured either directly during a flow experiment or from video tapes that had been recorded during the experiment. To classify attached objects, to determine their location along the x and y coordinates, to count objects, and to measure surface area coverage by attached objects, the images were processed using MetaMorph® image processing software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). To quantitate melanoma cell arrest, the hydroethidine-stained cells (1 × 107 in 1 ml of DMEM) were suspended in 3 ml of mepacrine-containing blood and perfused over the collagen I matrix at a wall shear rate of 50 s⁻1. Without interrupting the flow or changing the flow rate, the chamber was then perfused with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and images of predefined optical fields (255 × 255 μm2 each) were captured as follows. We designed a computer program which directed the mobile stage of the microscope to 50 predefined x and y positions starting from a reference point. The program further controlled the acquisition of images. At each position, two images were captured using filter settings to detect red fluorescence (melanoma cells) or green fluorescence (platelets and leukocytes), respectively. From these images, attached melanoma cells were enumerated based on their unique red fluorescence, and thrombi were identified and counted based on their size and green fluorescence. To differentiate thrombus-associated from directly matrix-attached melanoma cells, the coordinates of the melanoma cells were determined and compared to those of thrombi. During or at the end of experimental runs, numerous attached objects which were identified as melanoma cell-containing thrombi using the fluorescence mode were routinely subjected to confocal z sectioning in order to verify their cellular composition (platelets and blood cells detected at 488 nm, melanoma cells at 543 nm). The area within which the 50 measuring fields were defined was 4 × 6.3 mm. This area was located 1 mm away from the inlet and 3 mm away from the lateral margins of the flow chamber. This location was kept constant and was arbitrarily chosen, acknowledging that platelets and leukocytes attached to, and melanoma cells began to associate with, adherent thrombi already within the immediate vicinity of the inlet and thus became depleted from the suspension which reached the measuring area. To describe the relationship of thrombus size and melanoma cell association with thrombi, attached objects were classified as single platelets, microthrombi, small thrombi, or large thrombi. For this purpose the images were processed as follows. The background intensity of each image was determined and subtracted in order to standardize images which were acquired during different experimental runs. For binarization, the threshold was set to a level where the binarized image resembled the original image best. This is an arbitrary process which requires that the chosen threshold level is kept constant throughout measurement of all images in order to allow a valid comparison of the measured areas. In each of 10 randomly chosen images, the surface area coverage of 30 single platelets was measured, and average surface areas were determined. Based on these measurements, the objects were classified as single platelets (1-70 pixels), micro thrombi (71-250 pixels), small thrombi (251-1000 pixels), or large thrombi (>1000 pixels) wherein the distinction between thrombus classes is arbitrary. The total area of one optical field corresponded to 215,384 pixels. To test our hypothesis that platelets may assist melanoma cell arrest during blood flow, we initially tested whether the melanoma cells can stimulate and induce platelet aggregation by using the classical stir aggregometer approach. This is important because the activation state of platelets may be critical for platelet-melanoma cell interaction(10.Honn K.V. Tang D.G. Crissman J.D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 325-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). M21 cells (or their variants, as below) were added to human platelet-rich plasma from citrate-treated blood at final concentrations of 5 × 105, 1 × 106, or 5 × 106 cells/ml and in the absence of other stimulants. The melanoma cells failed to induce platelet aggregation under these conditions, whereas 2 μM ADP, as a control, did (data not shown). For this reason, and because we wanted to examine the role of platelets on melanoma cell arrest during blood flow at a low shear rate, we chose collagen type I as an experimental matrix. At a low wall shear rate of 50 s⁻1, corresponding to a venous shear rate, collagen I promotes platelet adhesion mediated by integrin α2β1 (23.Kunicki T.J. Nugent D.J. Staats S.J. Orchekowski R.P. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4516-4519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and this results in platelet stimulation (24.Brass L.F. Bensusan H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and thrombus formation(25.Baumgartner H.R. Muggli R. Tschopp T.B. Turitto V.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1976; 35: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). At a wall shear rate of 50 s⁻1, platelets readily attached to the collagen I matrix, initially as single platelets. Within the measuring area, microthrombi consisting of 2-10 platelets formed within the first minute of perfusion. Within the second minute, additional platelets attached to adherent microthrombi resulting in the formation of small thrombi which continued to grow larger in size with continued perfusion. Thrombus formation indicated that the attached platelets had become activated and this promoted platelet cohesion. M21 melanoma cells failed to interact with the matrix during the first 2 min of perfusion. After this initial period, immobilized M21 cells were detected, and this coincided with the appearance of larger size thrombi (Fig. 1). Analyzing the positions of arrested melanoma cells revealed that 93% or more of the attached M21 cells were associated with platelet-containing thrombi. Within the measured surface area, 36-49% of the counted large thrombi contained M21 melanoma cells. M21 cells which did not establish contact to a thrombus largely failed to anchor to the matrix. Analysis of the cellular composition and three-dimensional topography of melanoma cell-containing thrombi by confocal z sectioning under continued flow showed platelets in direct contact with the melanoma cells and revealed the presence of leukocytes in most of the analyzed thrombi. A representative example of a melanoma cell-containing thrombus is shown in Fig. 2. In the majority of cases, the melanoma cells were not in contact with the matrix but attached to underlying platelets, sometimes in the vicinity of leukocytes. The rare individually attached M21 cells which were not associated with thrombi adhered directly to the matrix. These data demonstrate that melanoma cells suspended in blood can interact with platelets and thereby associate with and become incorporated into thrombi under flow conditions. This interaction with platelets greatly promoted melanoma cell arrest on the matrix during blood flow. This result was confirmed by quantitation of thrombus-associated versus directly matrix-attached M21 cells at 50 predefined positions at the end of the experimental runs as shown in Fig. 3. Corresponding results were obtained in numerous experiments using blood from different donors.Figure 2:Confocal z sections of an M21 melanoma cell arrested inside of an attached thrombus.

A, M21 cells (1 × 107 in 1 ml DMEM) were suspended in 3 ml of human blood and perfused over collagen I at a shear rate of 50 s⁻1 in the absence or presence of 50 μg/ml of mAbs LJ-CP8 (function blocking anti-αIIbβ3) or AV-10 (not blocking anti-β3), both IgG1, or 20 nM prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Without interrupting the flow, the chamber was then perfused with 3% paraformaldehyde and attached melanoma cells or thrombi were quantified by using a computer program which directed the mobile stage of the microscope to 50 predefined positions and controlled capturing of images with filter settings for green (all cells and platelets) or red fluorescence (melanoma cells) at identical x and y positions. Attached melanoma cells were identified as thrombus-associated by analyzing their position coordinates on the “green” and “red” images of identical optical fields using MetaMorph® image processing software. Platelet thrombi were distinguished from adherent leukocytes or individually attached melanoma cells by their larger size. Frequent confocal sectioning along the z axis of attached objects during control runs revealed objects, typically counted as thrombi, as aggregates of platelets or heteroaggregates containing platelets, leukocytes and/or melanoma cells (Fig. 2 shows an example). Optical field dimensions were 255 × 255 μm2. Each bar represents the mean number of attached objects in 50 predefined fields of triplicate runs ± S.D. The data presented were obtained on the same day using blood from one donor. Numbers of attached thrombi and dependent numbers of thrombus-associated melanoma cells varied slightly due to blood donor variability. Controls runs at the beginning and end of each session ensured unchanged performance of the blood samples throughout the experiment.

PGE1 interferes with platelet activation. Thus, the formation of large thrombi in response to platelet attachment to collagen I was inhibited. The melanoma cells failed to establish stable interactions with individually attached platelets or microthrombi even though the surface area covered by single platelets and micro thrombi in the presence of PGE1 accounted for 68% of the area covered by large thrombi in control runs. Inhibition of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 function by mAb LJ-CP8 does not interfere with platelet activation, but blocks thrombus formation because the antibody prevents fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3(15.Niiya K.

The mutant protein also facilitates the autocatalytic cleavage of the LexA repressor, but at a reduced rate. INTRODUCTIONThe RecA protein of Escherichia coli is a 352-amino acid polypeptide chain with a predicted molecular weight of 37,842. The protein is found in all bacteria and is critical to the processes of recombinational DNA repair, homologous recombination, induction of the SOS response to DNA damage, SOS mutagenesis, and the partitioning of chromosomes at cell division (Clark and Sandler, 1994; Cox, 1994; Kowalczykowski et al., 1994; Stasiak and Egelman, 1994; Livneh et al., 1993; West, 1992; Roca and Cox, 1990).In vitro, RecA protein promotes a set of DNA strand exchange reactions that mimics its presumed role in recombination and recombinational DNA repair. The reactions can involve either three or four DNA strands (Fig. 1). RecA first forms a nucleoprotein filament on the single-stranded or gapped DNA substrate. This DNA is then aligned with a homologous linear duplex DNA. A strand switch then occurs within the filament producing a nascent region of hybrid DNA, which is extended to generate the products shown. In a normal reaction, strand exchange proceeds unidirectionally, 5′ to 3′ relative to the single-stranded DNA (or the single-stranded region of the gapped DNA) to which the RecA first binds. The reaction also proceeds past a variety of structural barriers in the DNA substrates.RecA protein is a DNA-dependent ATPase, with a monomer kcat of 30 min-1 when bound to ssDNA. ( 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAwtRecAthe wild type RecA proteinDTTdithiothreitolAMT4′-aminomethyl-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralenbpbase pair(s)kbpkilobase pair(s)ATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphateSSBthe single-stranded DNA binding protein of E. coliPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) ATP is hydrolyzed uniformly throughout the nucleoprotein filament (Brenner et al., 1987). When a homologous duplex DNA is added to the reaction, the kcat drops abruptly to about 20 min-1, and remains at that level throughout the ensuing DNA strand exchange reaction as long as ATP is regenerated (Schutte and Cox, 1987; Ullsperger and Cox, 1995). The reaction is apparently quite inefficient, with about 100 ATPs hydrolyzed per base pair of hybrid DNA created. The function of this ATP hydrolysis is incompletely understood. An important clue was provided by the observation that RecA protein can promote DNA strand exchange under some conditions in the presence of ATPγS, an ATP analog that is not readily hydrolyzed by RecA (Menetski et al., 1990; Rosselli and Stasiak, 1990). This observation was reinforced more recently by work on the RecA mutant K72R (Rehrauer and Kowalczykowski, 1993) and again with wild type RecA protein in the presence of ADP-AlF4- (Kowalczykowski and Krupp, 1995). The Lys → Arg substitution in the K72R mutant occurs in a well conserved nucleotide binding fold, and the mutant protein binds but does not hydrolyze ATP. The mutant will also promote a limited DNA strand exchange, functioning best with dATP (Rehrauer and Kowalczykowski, 1993). These results demonstrate that the RecA filament has an inherent capacity to take up at least three DNA strands and promote DNA strand exchange without ATP hydrolysis, and have been used to argue against an essential role for ATP hydrolysis in DNA strand exchange. The RecA filament tends to stabilize the hybrid DNA products of a DNA strand exchange reaction (Adzuma, 1992).Why, then, does RecA protein hydrolyze ATP? One way to elucidate the function of RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis is to define the limitations of reactions that occur without it. A series of studies determined that the strand exchange occurring withq ATPγS is limited in extent and bidirectional (Jain et al., 1994; Konforti and Davis, 1992). The ATPγS reactions also did not proceed past structural barriers in the DNA (Kim et al., 1992a; Rosselli and Stasiak, 1991) and did not accommodate four DNA strands (Kim et al., 1992b). ATP hydrolysis therefore appears to confer several important properties to the DNA strand exchange reaction, being required in particular for unidirectional branch movement that can bypass barriers and for four-strand exchange reactions. These observations provide some indirect mechanistic clues but have been obtained only under the conditions used with ATPγS.The properties of RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange in the absence of ATP hydrolysis provoke questions which, if answered, might shed additional light on ATP function and strand exchange mechanism. In studies to date with three-strand exchange reactions using homologous substrates, there is a rapid formation of a limited segment of hybrid DNA product (typically 1-3 kbp). However, at this point the reaction halts or slows dramatically. Since the entire filament is capable of promoting an exchange between homologous substrates, it is surprising that the entire reaction does not proceed to completion. The slowing or cessation of strand exchange implies that discontinuities exist in some component of an early strand exchange intermediate. The one possibility presented to date involves filament discontinuities, with ATP hydrolysis needed to recycle RecA monomers and correct the discontinuities (Menetski et al., 1990; Rehrauer and Kowalczykowski, 1993; Kowalczykowski and Krupp, 1995). As shown below, the only reasonable alternative involves discontinuities in a key DNA structure that serves as a strand exchange intermediate.A similar and related unresolved question can be defined even under conditions in which ATP is being hydrolyzed. Upon addition of a homologous duplex DNA to RecA•ssDNA complexes hydrolyzing ATP, the rate of ATP hydrolysis declines abruptly by up to 30%. The observed decline is directly proportional to the length of homologous sequence in the duplex, providing evidence that the entire length of available homology is detected within a minute or two with direct DNA-DNA interactions occurring over distances of 8 kbp or more (Schutte and Cox, 1987). However, productive strand exchange detectable after RecA removal from the DNA proceeds much slower, requiring 20 min or more to encompass the same 8 kbp. There again appears to be a fast phase of strand exchange in which some short length of hybrid DNA is generated, followed by a slow phase in which the nascent hybrid DNA is extended. The fast phase is sometimes manifested as an apparent burst phase in hybrid DNA formation when ATP is hydrolyzed (Kahn and Radding, 1984; Bedale and Cox, 1996). As in the cases where ATP is not hydrolyzed, it is necessary to explain why the fast phase comes to an end before strand exchange is complete, even though the response of the filament indicates the detection of homology along the entire length of the DNA.In this report, we further explore the properties of the fast and slow reaction phases and present a simple model that explains why the fast phase is limited in extent. The model also explains all properties of the two reaction phases and applies to reactions carried out with or without hydrolysis of ATP. The results complement and/or confirm a number of previous observations obtained with ATPγS, using RecA K72R employed under more classical reaction conditions, and further characterize the RecA K72R mutant protein. To date, many aspects of the DNA strand exchange reaction promoted by the RecA K72R mutant protein remain unexplored, but have the potential to test many of the ideas outlined above about the role of the RecA ATPase activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzymes and BiochemicalsE. coli RecA protein was purified and stored as described previously (Cox et al., 1981). The RecA protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of ∈280= 0.59 A280 mg-1 ml (Craig and Roberts, 1981). E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) was purified as described (Lohman et al., 1986) with the minor modification that a DEAE-Sepharose column was added to ensure removal of single-stranded DNA exonucleases. The concentration of SSB protein was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of ∈280 = 1.5 A280 mg-1 ml (Lohman and Overman, 1985). Purified LexA repressor was a generous gift from Dr. John Little (University of Arizona). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the University of Wisconsin Biochemistry Department Synthesis Facility. The Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Restriction endonucleases, β-agarase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Terminal transferase and ATPγS were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Ultrapure dATP, DEAE-Sepharose resin, and a Mono Q column were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Amino-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (AMT) was from Calbiochem. Tris buffer was from Fisher. ATP, proteinase K, lactic dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form, NADH+), creatine phosphokinase, phosphocreatine, and low melting agarose were purchased from Sigma. Hydroxylapatite resin was from Bio-Rad.DNADuplex and ssDNA substrates were derived from bacteriophage ϕX174 (5386 bp) and M13mp8 (7229 bp) (Messing, 1983). ϕX174 supercoiled circular duplex DNA and viral circular ssDNA were purchased from New England Biolabs. Bacteriophage M13mp8.52 (7251 bp) is bacteriophage M13mp8 with a short heterologous sequence (52 bp) originally derived from the plasmid pJFS36 (Senecoff et al., 1985) replacing the 30-bp EcoRI-PstI fragment of bacteriophage M13mp8 (Kim et al., 1992a). Bacteriophage M13mp8.1037 (8266 bp) is bacteriophage M13mp8 with 1037 bp (EcoRV fragment from the E. coli galT gene) inserted into the SmaI site (previously called M13mp8.1041) (Lindsley and Cox, 1990b). Supercoiled circular duplex DNA and circular single-stranded DNA from bacteriophage M13mp8 and its derivatives were prepared as described previously (Davis et al., 1980; Messing, 1983; Neuendorf and Cox, 1986). The concentration of dsDNA and ssDNA stock solutions were determined by absorbance at 260 nm, using 50 and 36 mg ml-1A260-1, respectively, as conversion factors. DNA concentrations are expressed in terms of total nucleotides. Linear duplex DNA substrates were generated by complete digestion of supercoiled DNA by appropriate restriction endonucleases. The protein was removed by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) followed by ethanol precipitation. Linear duplex DNA fragments were generated by digesting supercoiled DNA with appropriate restriction endonucleases and isolating from preparative low melting agarose gel using β-agarase or as described (Sambrook et al., 1989). The fragments were then extracted twice with Tris-EDTA-saturated butyl alcohol, followed by 1:1 extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The fragments were finally concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Gapped duplex DNA substrates were prepared using a large scale (reaction volume = 1.2 ml) RecA reaction. The reaction contained 20 μM circular M13mp8.1037 ssDNA, 20 μM M13mp8 linear double-stranded DNA (digested with SmaI), 6.7 μM wtRecA protein, 2 μM SSB, and 3 mM ATP. Reactions were carried out under standard strand exchange conditions listed below, for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA, SDS, and proteinase K to 12 mM, 1%, and 1 mg/ml, respectively. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then extracted 1:1 with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), and the DNA was concentrated in a Microcon concentrator (Amicon). The concentrated reaction mixture was electrophoresed overnight in a 0.8% low melting agarose gel at about 2 V cm-1. The gapped duplex DNA was purified from low melting agarose as described above. The resulting gapped duplex species is called GD1037 (formerly called GD1041) (Kim et al., 1992b)BuffersP buffer contained 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol. R buffer contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, 80% cation (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol.Cloning and Overexpressing the recA K72R GeneThe recA K72R gene was cloned by a polymerase chain reaction-based, site-directed mutagenesis procedure. Briefly, a DNA fragment containing the first 236 bp of the recA coding region was polymerase chain reaction synthesized with one primer containing the mutation code for Arg (CGA) at residue 72 and the internal PstI site within the recA gene. This fragment was cloned into pBluescriptSK(-) (Stratagene). The identity of the mutated recA gene fragment was checked by sequencing, and subsequently the recA gene fragment containing the desired mutation was swapped with corresponding fragment from wild-type RecA gene in pUC18, to create pRecA17 (4.0 kbp). The integrity of the cloned recA K72R gene was confirmed by direct sequencing. To express the recA K72R gene, a 16-liter culture of E. coli strain GE643 (lexA51, ΔrecA1398) (Weisemann and Weinstock, 1985) transformed with pRecA17 was grown in LB medium for 16 h at 37°C with aeration. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4200 rpm at 4°C in a Beckman JA6 rotor. The cell pellet was washed with cell harvest buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 80% cation, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose) and then centrifuged again. The pellet was resuspended in cell harvest buffer to give an OD600 reading of about 400. The cell suspension was quickly frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70°C.Purification of the RecA K72R ProteinThe RecA K72R protein was purified by a modification of the procedure used for the wild type RecA protein. Briefly, 50 g of cell paste were thawed on ice overnight. Cell lysis, polymin P precipitation, and ammonium sulfate extraction were performed as described by Cox et al.(1981). The supernatant from the ammonium sulfate extraction was precipitated three times by adding solid ammonium sulfate to 0.28 g/ml. The pellet was finally resuspended in 10 ml of R buffer + 50 mM KCl and dialyzed overnight against 2 × 1 liter of the same buffer, giving rise to fraction II (18.8 ml, 368 mg of protein). This was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 cm × 14 cm, 70-ml bed volume). The column was washed with R + 50 mM KCl buffer, and the majority of the RecA protein appeared in the flow-through. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE. Protein in the pooled peak fractions was precipitated by adding solid ammonium sulfate to 0.28 g/ml, collected by low speed centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of P buffer, and dialyzed against 2 × 1 liter of P buffer overnight to generate fraction III (10 ml, 140 mg protein). Fraction III was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (2.5 cm × 7 cm, 35-ml bed volume). The column was washed with 40 ml of P buffer and developed with 360 ml of linear gradient from 20 to 500 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Protein-containing fractions were located by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against 3 × 2 liters of R + 50 mM KCl to generate fraction IV (47 ml, 74 mg of protein). Fraction IV was applied to a 1-ml Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography column for several runs using a superloop, and the column was washed with 3 ml of R + 50 mM KCl buffer and developed with 30 ml of 0.05 to 1 M KCl linear gradient. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 2 × 3 liters of R buffer, producing fraction V (11 ml). This fraction was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. The final yield of the RecA K72R protein from this 50-g cell paste was 22 mg. The RecA K72R protein was at least 98% pure as judged by a densitometric scan of a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel. The concentration of the RecA K72R protein was determined using the same extinction coefficient as wild type RecA protein. The RecA K72R protein was free of detectable endo- or exonucleases.Strand Exchange Reaction ConditionsUnless otherwise specified, all reactions were performed at 37°C in a standard strand exchange reaction buffer containing 25 mM Tris acetate (80% cation, pH 7.5), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 3 mM potassium glutamate, 1 mM DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol, and an ATP (4.7 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 units ml-1 pyruvate kinase) or a dATP (11.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units ml-1 pyruvate kinase) regeneration system. Linear duplex DNA and circular single-stranded or gapped duplex DNA were preincubated with RecA protein or RecA K72R protein for 10 min before the indicated concentrations of dATP (or ATP) and SSB protein were added to initiate the reaction. A regeneration system was omitted in some experiments as noted. The magnesium acetate and dATP concentrations, as well as the order of addition of RecA K72R and SSB, were varied in some experiments as indicated in the text and figure legends.After the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) for at least 30 min and destained for at least 2 h, the gel was then photographed over an ultraviolet transilluminator. The intensities of DNA bands were quantified by scanning the photographic negatives using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI and analyzing the image with ImageQuant software (Version 4.2). In order to correct for variability in sample loading onto the agarose gel, the band corresponding to full-length products and/or the broad smear representing intermediates of the strand exchange reaction were quantified as the fraction of the total fluorescing DNA in a given gel lane.In some experiments, the data was plotted with respect to the concentration of Mg2+ in excess of that involved in a complex with dATP. The concentration of “excess” Mg2+ was calculated based on the reported dissociation constant of 1 × 10-1M for the Mg•ATP complex (Alberty, 1969).Agarose Gel AssaysAliquots (10 μl) of the reactions were removed at each indicated time point, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.25 volume of gel loading buffer (60 mM EDTA, 5% SDS, 25% (w/v) glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue). Samples were electrophoresed overnight in a 0.8% agarose gel at 2 V cm-1. In some experiments, aliquots of the reactions were cross-linked with AMT before gel electrophoresis as described below.DNA-dependent ATPase and dATPase AssaysThe ssDNA-dependent ATPase or dATPase activity of the RecA K72R and the wild type RecA protein was measured by a coupled enzyme assay (Lindsley and Cox, 1990a; Morrical et al., 1986). In addition to the appropriate phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase regeneration system described above, reactions contained 3 mM NADH and 4.5 units ml-1 lactic dehydrogenase. Absorbances were measured at 380 nm, rather than 340 nm (the absorbance maximum for NADH), to remain within the linear range of the spectrophotometer. An NADH extinction coefficient of є380 = 1.21 mM-1 cm-1 was used to calculate the rate of ATP or dATP hydrolysis. Reaction mixtures (400 μl) also contained 8 μM circular M13mp8 ssDNA and RecA protein as noted, in standard strand exchange reaction buffer. Reactions were started by the addition of SSB protein and ATP or dATP to final concentrations of 0.8 μM and 3 mM, respectively.Electron MicroscopySamples for electron microscopy were obtained by spreading the entire strand exchange reaction mixture. Reaction mixtures were cross-linked with AMT prior to examination by electron microscopy to prevent spontaneous branch migration during sample preparation. Samples were cross-linked by addition of AMT to a final concentration of 30 μg ml-1, incubated at room temperature for 3 min and irradiated with long wave UV light (Umlauf et al., 1990) for 4 min at room temperature. The UV light was generated with two 15-watt fluorescent black light tubes. Samples were placed 8 cm below the UV light source. The cross-linked samples were incubated with proteinase K (1 mg ml-1 final) and SDS (1% final) for 30 min at 37°C. The samples were dialyzed into 20 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA for 5 h at room temperature on Millipore type VM (0.05 mm) filters (Jain et al., 1994) and then spread as described previously (Inman and Schnös, 1970). Photography and measurements of the DNA molecules were performed as described previously (Littlewood and Inman, 1982).Three types of information were derived from the electron microscopy experiments. First we wished to confirm that the reaction intermediates observed on gels had the anticipated structure. Representative molecules are shown for some experiments and results described in the text. Second, we wished to determine the proportion of the duplex linear substrates that was involved in DNA strand exchange reactions leading to intermediates. This was done by counting the intermediates and unreacted linear duplex DNA molecules found in a representative sample from each experiment. Complex recombinational events involving more than two DNA substrate molecules and events that were interpreted to arise from broken or nicked substrates (the latter produce low levels of complex reaction products in the reactions) were ignored in these estimates. In some experiments, the grids from different reactions were assigned an undescriptive identification code by Q. S., and were subsequently counted in a random sequence by R. B. I. Third, it was important to estimate the length of hybrid DNA generated for a representative sample of intermediates in some experiments. Because of the large numbers of samples, obtaining accurate measurements of significant numbers of intermediates in all of them was impractical; we have therefore estimated the degree of exchange as described earlier (Jain et al., 1994). Briefly, the ratio of unexchanged to exchanged duplex DNA was judged. These ratios were then converted into base pairs of exchanged DNA using the known length of the linear dsDNA substrate. The data were sorted into 8-10 degrees of exchange and plotted as histograms. Degrees of exchange with the 1.3-kbp DNA fragment used as a substrate in some experiments was divided in this manner into eight equal segments of 165 bp; linear M13mp8.1037 dsDNA was divided into 10 segments of 830 bp.These judgments were checked in two ways. First, two grids each from two different samples were counted and judged “blind” as described above. The four sets of data were then compared by the χ2 two-way contingency test at the 95% confidence level. In both cases, the data sets for the two samples were not significantly different. The judgments have also been checked directly by comparing the data obtained to data from more detailed measurements done on the same samples (Jain et al., 1994). Statistical analysis again showed that there is no significant difference in the result obtained with the two methods.LexA Repressor Cleavage AssayReactions (100 μl) were carried out at 37°C and contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, an ATP regeneration system (12 mM phosphocreatine, 10 units ml-1 creatine phosphokinase), 40 μM circular M13mp8 ssDNA, 8.9 μM LexA repressor, and 1.33 μM wild type RecA or RecA K72R protein. The reactions did not contain SSB (Little, 1984). Additional LexA repressor cleavage assays were performed using dATP (with the dATP regeneration system described above) or ATPγS (1 mM) as a nucleotide cofactor. Aliquots (10 μl) were removed at different time points, followed by addition of 5 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated at 95°C for 3 min before they were analyzed by 13% SDS-PAGE. The destained gels were scanned and quantified using the NIH Image Analysis Program (Version 1.44).Copies of the electron micrographs discussed in this publication are available for viewing or downloading using a World-Wide Web client at the URL: http://phage.bocklabs.wisc.edu/.RESULTSExperimental DesignThe goal of these experiments is a more complete characterization of the DNA strand exchange reaction promoted by RecA K72R as a means to address ATPase function. A few experiments were done to measure basic ATPase and strand exchange activities to ensure that our mutant protein exhibited the properties reported by Rehrauer and Kowalczykowski(1993). Proceeding from this base line, we then characterized the magnesium requirements for RecA K72R-mediated DNA strand exchange in detail as a means to distinguish two phases in the reaction. Finally, we tested the capacity of the K72R mutant protein to promote unidirectional strand exchange, bypass of structural barriers in the DNA during strand exchange, and DNA strand exchange with four DNA strands, using strategies similar to those employed in several recent studies (Jain et al., 1994; Kim et al., 1992a, 1992b). We also explored the capacity of the mutant protein to facilitate the cleavage of LexA protein.The RecA K72R Mutant Protein Does Not Hydrolyze ATP or dATPUsing a coupled spectrophotometric assay, we measured the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of both the mutant and wild type proteins with ATP and dATP. The mutant did not produce a rate of ATP or dATP hydrolysis detectable above background. Based on an evaluation of assay sensitivity, we estimated the upper limit for ATP and dATP hydrolysis (kcat) to be 0.12 min-1 and 0.24 min-1, respectively. The actual rate is probably much lower, and the results coincide well with the 600-850-fold reduction in NTP hydrolysis observed by Rehrauer and Kowalczykowski(1993). RecA K72R protein was also tested for dATP hydrolytic activities at 2, 4, 6, and 8 mM Mg2+, with no hydrolysis observed in any case. The measured kcat for the wtRecA protein bound to ssDNA in the presence of SSB was 29 min-1 and 36 min-1 for ATP and dATP hydrolysis, respectively, consistent with published findings.The RecA K72R Protein Promotes Limited DNA Strand Exchange in the Presence of dATPDNA strand exchange reactions between homologous linear double-stranded DNA and circular ssDNA substrates derived from ϕX174 phage in the presence of ATP and dATP under standard reaction conditions (including 10 mM magnesium acetate) were monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). In the presence of ATP, no DNA strand exchange reaction was observed with RecA K72R (Fig. 2A). Under the same reaction conditions, the wild type RecA protein promoted an efficient reaction (Fig. 2A). When dATP was used as the nucleotide cofactor, the mutant protein converted much of the substrate DNA to strand exchange intermediates (joint molecules). Very little complete strand exchange"

The mechanism of their effect was studied with a new method which utilizes ionomycin to increase [Ca2+]i, followed by bovine serum albumin (BSA) to remove the Ca2+ ionophore. The rapid decay of [Ca2+]i after BSA is mostly due to the reuptake into the stores, since it is strongly inhibited by the endomembrane Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. PGI2 and SNP are without effect on the BSA-promoted decay both with and without thapsigargin, showing that they do not affect the activity of the Ca2+-ATPases. The fast decay of [Ca2+]i after BSA is decreased by thrombin which produces the Ca2+ releaser inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), thus counteracting the activity of the endomembrane Ca2+ pump. When added after thrombin, PGI2 and SNP accelerate the BSA-activated decay of [Ca2+]i. However, under the same conditions, they do not decrease the concentration of InsP3. In saponin-permeabilized platelets, cAMP and cGMP counteract the Ca2+ release induced by exogenous InsP3. Their inhibitory effect disappears at high InsP3 concentrations. This demonstrates that PGI2 and SNP potentiate Ca2+ reuptake by inhibiting the InsP3 receptor. Two bands of approximately 260 kDa are recognized by a monoclonal antibody recognizing the C-terminal region of the InsP3 receptor. Both are phosphorylated rapidly, the heavier more intensely, in the presence of PGI2 and SNP. The phosphorylation of the InsP3 receptor is fast enough to be compatible with its involvement in the inhibition of the receptor by cyclic nucleotides.

The activation of platelets is stimulated or inhibited by numerous hormones, drugs, eicosanoids, and other vasoactive substances. Agonists such as thrombin, thromboxane, vasopressin, platelet-activating factor, and ADP elevate the cytosolic free Ca2+ and stimulate the activity of myosin light chain kinase and PKC ( 1The abbreviation used are: PKCprotein kinase CPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinasePKGcGMP-dependent protein kinaseBSAbovine serum albumin[Ca2+]icytosolic free Ca2+ concentrationInsP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphatePGI2prostaglandin I2 or prostacyclinSNPsodium nitroprussideTgthapsigargin.) resulting in platelet adhesion, aggregation, and degranulation(1.Siess W.

The agonist-releasable stores appear to be of two different types, distinguishable by the sensitivity of their Ca2+-ATPases to low thapsigargin (Tg) concentrations or to 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (or high Tg concentrations), respectively(6.Papp B.

J. 1995; 310: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The modes of Ca2+ entry are controversial. It is generally agreed that a substantial influx is activated by a signal generated by the depletion of the intracellular stores (capacitative Ca2+ influx) (9.Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) also in the absence of agonist, e.g. by treatment with the endomembrane Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor Tg(10.Sargeant P.

J. 1991; 280: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); such a signal could be a small molecule released together with the Ca2+ ions from the stores(12.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 808-814Crossref Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 13.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

Receptor-mediated influx systems are also operative. ADP induces a very fast Ca2+ entry which precedes the release from the intracellular stores and the subsequent second phase of Ca2+ entry(4.Sage S.O. Reast R. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We recently found that the occupancy of the thrombin receptor activates a store-independent Ca2+ influx (17.Doni M.G. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Ca2+ efflux from platelets is operated by a Ca2+-ATPase, whose activity is potentiated by the activation of PKC (18.Rink T.J. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 393: 513-524Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19.Cavallini L. Alexandre A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as well as by the depletion of the stores (19.Cavallini L. Alexandre A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP exert multiple inhibitory actions on platelet activation. cAMP was shown to decrease the binding of thrombin to its receptor on human platelets(20.Lerea K.M. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5620-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the presence of cAMP, the activation of phospholipase C (and hence the production of InsP3 and diacylglycerol) by the agonist is depressed, leading to the inhibition of the increment of [Ca2+]i and of PKC-dependent phosphorylations(21.Watson S.P. McConnell R.T. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13199-13203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The action of cAMP is also on events distal to the activation of phospholipase C since platelet aggregation and secretion induced by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin or by phorbol esters are also inhibited by the cyclic nucleotide(22.Doni M.G. Deana R. Bertoncello S. Zoccarato F. Alexandre A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 1316-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23.Pannocchia A. Hardisty R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 1989; 258: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). cAMP also increases the incorporation of diacylglycerol into phosphatidylinositol(25.Lapetina E.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similar inhibitory actions were reported for cGMP, which interferes with the agonist-induced activation of phospholipase C (26.Geiger J. Nolte C. Butt E. Sage S.O. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32.Doni M.G. Alexandre A. Padoin E. Francesconi M.A. Deana R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cGMP potentiates theaction of cAMP elevating agents, by inhibiting the cAMP phosphodiesterase(33.Maurice D.H. Haslam R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 671-681PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclic nucleotides also interfere with the Ca2+ influx. We recently reported that cAMP and cGMP inhibit the thrombin-activated Ca2+ influx in platelets, without interfering with the Ca2+ influx secondary to the depletion of the intracellular stores(17.Doni M.G. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An inhibition by cAMP and cGMP has been reported recently on Ca2+ influx activated by thromboxane(34.Brüne B. von Appen F. Ullrich V. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the ADP-activated Ca2+ influx has been reported to be insensitive to cAMP(3.Sage S.O. Rink T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16364-16369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The action of cAMP and cGMP on Ca2+ movements to and from the intracellular deposits is controversial and has received considerable attention. The activity of PKA was reported to be facilitatory, or even necessary, for Ca2+ release by InsP3 from isolated platelet membrane vesicles(35.Enouf J. Giraud F. Bredoux R. Bordeau N. Levy-Toledano S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 928: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This conclusion was refuted(36.O'Rourke F. Zavoico G.B. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of PKA was reported to stimulate Ca2+ uptake by platelet membrane vesicles(35.Enouf J. Giraud F. Bredoux R. Bordeau N. Levy-Toledano S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 928: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37.Aduniah S.E. Dean W.L. Biochim. Biophys.

This effect was correlated with the phosphorylation of a protein tentatively identified with phospholamban, the known promoter of Ca2+ transport in cardiac muscle membranes, but that identity was disputed(39.Le Peuch C. Le Peuch D.A.M. Kata S. De Maille J.G. Hincker M.T. Bredoux R. Enouf J. Levy-Toledano S. Caen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 731: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other hand, dibutyryl cAMP, and various prostaglandins and forskolin, are known to stimulate adenylate cyclase and reverse the Ca2+ mobilization produced by platelet agonists(40.Rink T.J. Smith S.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 338: 66P-67PGoogle Scholar, 41.Yamanishi J. Kawahara Y. Fukuzaki H. Thromb.

Commun. 1983; 113: 598-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of cAMP to saponin-permeabilized platelets was reported to decrease the amount of Ca2+ released by the InsP3-sensitive stores (43.Thomatsu T. Nishida A. Nagao S. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1013: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with the catalytic subunit of PKA (4.Sage S.O. Reast R. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Finally, it was also proposed that cAMP and cGMP potentiate the action of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase(45.Johansson J.S. Nied L.E. Haynes D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The present study was performed to settle some controversy concerning the action of cAMP and cGMP on Ca2+ movements between cytosol and the stores. It is shown that both cyclic nucleotides are without effect on the Ca2+ pumps (including the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump) and that their action is to prevent the Ca2+-releasing activity of InsP3. Both cAMP and cGMP promote the phosphorylation of the InsP3 receptor. Thrombin, sodium nitroprusside, apyrase, hirudin, ionomycin, thapsigargin, staurosporine, cAMP, dibutyryl-cAMP, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (P 5511) were purchased from Sigma, GF 109 203X (2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)indol-3-yl]-3-(indol-3-yl)maleimide) was from Boehringer Mannheim, 8-Br-cGMP, Fluo 3, and Indo 1/AM from Calbiochem, prostacyclin (PGI2) from Cascade Biochem Ltd., United Kingdom. The anti-InsP3 receptor (mouse monoclonal) antibody, prepared as in (46.Bourguignon L.Y.W. Iida N. Jin J.H. Cell Biol. Int. 1993; 17: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and recognizing its C terminus cytoplasmic domain, was from Calbiochem (Catalogue No. 407140), the biotinylated anti-mouse antibody was from Dakopatts A/S, Denmark. The streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase complex and the D-myo-[3H]Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) assay system (the InsP3 radioimmunoassay kit TRK 1000) were from Amersham Int. The chemiluminescent reagent was the chemiluminescent protein detection system Immun-Lite II (anti-mouse Catalogue No. 160 6478) from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Platelet-rich plasma and washed platelets were prepared and treated with aspirin as previously reported (22.Doni M.G. Deana R. Bertoncello S. Zoccarato F. Alexandre A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 1316-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) from fresh blood drawn from healthy volunteers and mixed with acid citrate-dextrose anticoagulant supplemented with hirudin (50 milliunits/ml) apyrase (80 milliunits/ml) and PGI2 (0.2 μg/ml). The intracellular Ca2+ concentration was determined with Indo 1/AM essentially according to Pollock and Rink (47.Pollock W.K. Rink T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ fluorescent probe (2 μM) was added to aspirin-treated platelet-rich plasma, and loading was performed for 30 min at 37°C. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Na-Hepes, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) in the presence of 0.1 mM sulfinpyrazone(48.Di Virgilio F. Fasolato C. Steiberg T.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), 40 milliunits/ml apyrase, and 5 milliunits/ml hirudin. The platelets were used at the concentration of 1 × 108 cells/ml. All experiments were performed in the presence 0.5 mM EGTA. Unless otherwise stated, fluorescence was measured at 37°C in a thermostated, magnetically stirred cuvette, in a Shimadzu RL-5000 spectrofluorimeter with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 340 nm and 400 nm. The amount of InsP3 was determined on 0.5-ml aliquots of platelet suspensions (5-6 × 108 cells/ml) precipitated with 5% (v:v) ice-cold perchloric acid. After 20 min in ice, the deproteinized samples were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min and neutralized with KHCO3. The samples were used for the InsP3 determination with the Amersham radioimmunoassay kit and following its specifications. For the detection of Ca2+ release induced by exogenous InsP3, platelets were suspended in Tyrode's buffer (not supplemented with hirudin and apyrase) at 2 × 109/ml. Immediately before use, they were diluted five times with a KCl buffer (100 mM KCl, 100 mM sucrose, 1.4 mM MgCl2, 20 mM K-Hepes, pH 7.4) and supplemented with (final concentrations): NaN3 (1 mM), oligomycin (0.6 μg/ml), phosphocreatine (7.5 mM), creatine kinase (30 μg/ml), ATP (1 mM), KH2PO4 (1 mM), and Fluo 3 (4 μM). Free Ca2+ was decreased to approximately 300 nM with EGTA (based on a Kd for Ca2+ of Fluo 3 of 316 nM). Permeabilization was induced with saponin (20-30 μg/ml, the correct concentration had to be adjusted with each preparation). After uptake, Ca2+ was released by pulses of InsP3 as described in the figures. Calibration were performed by back-titration of the Ca2+ traces with pulses of 2 μM EGTA. EDTA was removed from the PKA preparation by an ultrafiltration procedure (Minicent 10 Bio-Rad, 10 Kilodalton cutoff, filters). Fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths set at 488 and 526 nm. Incubation of the platelet suspension (4 × 108 cells/ml) was terminated by the addition of 1/5 volume of modified Laemmli's buffer (1.46 M Tris, 11.5% (w/v) SDS, 7.7% mercaptoethanol, 23% glycerol, and 30 mM dithiothreitol) at pH 6.8 followed by overnight room temperature denaturation. One-dimensional SDS electrophoresis was performed on two-step (5 and 11%) polyacrylamide minigels. The gels were colored with Coomassie Blue for the identification of the protein pattern or subjected to electrophoretic transfer (4 h at 450 mA) onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hoefer Scientific Instruments TM-NC4-roll) for subsequent probing with an anti-InsP3 receptor (mouse monoclonal) antibody. The blots were preincubated for 30 min with 5% (w/v) BSA in 0.1 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl saline buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween (TBST buffer) to block residual protein binding sites. Immunodetection of InsP3 receptor was achieved by using the monoclonal anti-InsP3 receptor antibody for 1 h at 37°C diluted 1:100 in TBST buffer. The primary antibody was then removed, and the blots washed three times in TBST containing 1% BSA. To detect the primary antibody, the blots were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:3000) for 30 min, washed 3 times in TBST, and then incubated with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase complex (1:3000), washed again 3 times in TBST, and then exposed to the Bio-Rad chemiluminescent reagents for 30 min(49.Bronstein I. Brooks E. Voita J.C. J. Bioluminesence Chemiluminescence. 1991; 4: 99-100Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Blots were then revealed by exposition for a time ranging from 3 to 10 min to photographic film. 32Pi loading was performed by incubating platelets at a concentration of 2 × 109 cells with 300 μCi/ml 32Pi for 60 min at room temperature. After diluting 10 times with Tyrode's buffer containing 0.2 μg/ml PGI2 and 3 mg/ml BSA, platelets were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in Tyrode's buffer for the subsequent stimulation at a concentration of 4 × 108 cells/ml. Platelets were incubated as specified in the legends to Figure 7:, Figure 8:. The incubations were terminated with the Laemmli buffer, and electrophoresis was performed as described above. The gels were colored and counted for at least a 10-h exposition to the β emission sensitive scanner-Instant Imager (Packard Instruments). Occasionally, counting was performed on the transblots. Analysis of the p260 and p47 phosphorylation for data reported in Fig. 8 was performed on a single band integration of the counts/min patterns obtained by the Instant Imager.Figure 8:Time course of the 260-kDa (InsP3) and of the 47-kDa protein phosphorylation by PGI2, SNP, and thrombin. ■, thrombin (0.25 unit/ml) added at zero time.

Cavallini L. Alexandre A. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19.Cavallini L. Alexandre A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and others(50.Brüne B. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19232-19237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51.Brüne B. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the addition of the agonist thrombin to aspirin-treated platelets resuspended in an EGTA-supplemented medium elicits a large increase of [Ca2+]i followed by a relatively rapid decrease close to the baseline, which is completed in 3-5 min. The decrease of [Ca2+]i is attributable to a relatively large extent to a net reuptake into the intracellular stores, since the subsequent addition of the endomembrane Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor Tg, together with a small amount of ionomycin to facilitate the release from the stores(17.Doni M.G. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), releases into the cytosol a significant proportion of the disappeared Ca2+ (Fig. 1). The decrease of [Ca2+]i is strongly stimulated if PGI2 or SNP (which generate cAMP and cGMP, respectively) are added soon after the peak of the thrombin-induced increase of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1) (see also (17.Doni M.G. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and (51.Brüne B. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). In the latter situation, the increase of [Ca2+]i upon addition of Tg plus ionomycin (a measure of the store-associated Ca2+) is significantly higher than in the control. Similar results are obtained also with the membrane-permeable dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-Br-cGMP, although they stimulate the decrease of [Ca2+]i somewhat less powerfully than PGI2 and SNP (results not reported). These experiments show that increasing cAMP or cGMP potentiates Ca2+ reuptake into the stores, apparently without major effects on Ca2+ efflux from platelets. The pattern in Fig. 1 is unchanged by the specific PKC inhibitor GF 109 203X (3 μM) which decreases only somewhat the decay rate of [Ca2+]i after thrombin; the stimulated decay by PGI2 and SNP are on the contrary totally abolished by staurosporine (1-2 μM) which also inhibits PKA and PKG (results not reported). The potentiation of Ca2+ reuptake into the stores promoted by the cyclic nucleotides could depend in principle on the increased activity of the store- and plasma membrane-associated Ca2+-ATPases or on the inhibition of Ca2+ release from the deposits. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we introduced a new method which utilizes the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin to mobilize Ca2+ without the intervention of agonists or inhibitors, followed by BSA to remove the ionophore. As described in Fig. 2, the addition of ionomycin to platelets suspended in EGTA-supplemented media induces a large increase of [Ca2+]i, released from the agonist-sensitive stores as well as from the secretory granules(19.Cavallini L. Alexandre A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At the ionomycin concentration used (400 nM), the agonist-sensitive deposits are largely depleted (as shown by the small increase of [Ca2+]i upon addition of Tg at the top of the ionomycin-induced deflection, Fig. 2B). The subsequent addition of BSA, which binds the ionophore, allows the study of the decay of [Ca2+]i, operated by the Ca2+ pumps, in the absence of perturbing agents. As shown in Fig. 2A, the decay of [Ca2+]i is very rapid upon addition of BSA (note that this experiment was performed at 20°C to decrease the activity of the pumps). Two processes contribute to the depletion of [Ca2+]i, namely pumping into the stores and pumping into the extracellular space. The use of Tg to inhibit the endomembrane Ca2+-ATPases allows quantitation of the contribution of each system to the overall decay rate. The decay of [Ca2+]i is strongly depressed by the inclusion of Tg prior to BSA (Fig. 2, compare B and A) showing that pumping into the stores prevails over pumping out of the platelets. The addition of PGI2 or SNP prior to ionomycin has no effect on the ionophore-induced increase of [Ca2+]i and importantly also has no effect on the rate of decrease of [Ca2+]i upon addition of BSA, both in the absence (Fig. 2A) and presence (Fig. 2B) of Tg. Accordingly, the refilling of the stores after BSA (in the experiment without Tg, Fig. 2A), as measured by the increase of [Ca2+]i following the addition of Tg, is unmodified by PGI2 and SNP. This is more clearly shown (with an expanded time scale) in Fig. 3, where, after ionomycin, BSA was supplemented both at submaximal and at maximal concentrations. At the lower BSA concentrations, some ionomycin is left unbound and activates variable degrees of Ca2+ cycling. In these conditions, the combined action of the Ca2+ pumps and the ionomycin-induced leaks leads to the establishment of intermediate levels of Ca2+ accumulation in the stores and to intermediate [Ca2+]i. The rate of decay of [Ca2+]i decreases and the steady state [Ca2+]i increases with decreasing BSA. In no case does the inclusion of PGI2 or SNP modify the decay rate or the final steady state. A stimulation of the pump would have resulted in an increased decay rate of [Ca2+]i and a decreased final steady state. These experiments show that the cyclic nucleotides do not interfere with the operation of the two endomembrane Ca2+-ATPases (6.Papp B. Pàszty K. Kovàcs T. Sarkadi B. Gardos G. Enouf J. Enyedi A. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7.Wuytack F. Papp B. Verboomen H. Raeymaekers L. Dode L. Bobe R. Enouf J. Bokkala S. Authi K.S. Casteels R. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 310: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) nor of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. The decay rate of [Ca2+]i upon removal of ionomycin with BSA, which is unaffected by increasing platelet cAMP and cGMP, is on the contrary strongly decreased if thrombin is supplemented together with BSA (Fig. 2C). This may be expected since the production of InsP3 induced by thrombin activates a InsP3-dependent (and BSA-insensitive) Ca2+ efflux from the deposits, which counteracts the action of the endomembrane Ca2+ pumps, thus decreasing the overall decay rate of [Ca2+]i. Accordingly, the amount of Ca2+ reaccumulated in the stores (shown by the increase of [Ca2+]i upon addition of Tg) is significantly less in the presence of thrombin (Fig. 2, compare C and A). Adding PGI2 or SNP along the [Ca2+]i decay curve after BSA plus thrombin induces a strong acceleration of the rate of disappearance of [Ca2+]i, paralleled by a clearcut increase of the Tg-releaseable Ca2+. This experiment shows that PGI2 and SNP oppose the Ca2+ efflux from the deposits induced by the thrombin-produced InsP3. Since the cyclic nucleotides appear not to modify the activity of the Ca2+ pumps, but rather to oppose the effect of InsP3, we measured the thrombin-induced production of InsP3 and the effect of supplementing PGI2 or SNP, after thrombin, on the platelet InsP3 content. As shown in Fig. 4, InsP3 increases sharply soon after the addition of thrombin, to progressively decre"

Binding of the NLS protein to the nuclear rim of digitonin-permeabilized cells is mediated by a heterodimeric complex, termed karyopherin(1.Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar)). These four transport factors are able to substitute for the requirement of cytosol in import of an NLS protein into nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells, even when prepared from Escherichia coli as recombinant proteins(14.Moroianu J. Hijikata M. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6532-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is likely that additional soluble factors are required. These factors may remain with the digitonin-permeabilized cells in sufficient quantities and therefore not be limiting or they may perform subtle regulatory tasks that have not yet been detected with this assay. Among these factors might be several Ran regulatory proteins, such as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor(15.Nishimoto T. Eilen E. Basilico C.

Nature. 1993; 366: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).A heterodimeric karyopherin has also been isolated from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and recombinant karyopherin α and β subunits have been shown to be able to dock NLS protein at the nuclear rim of digitonin-permeabilized mammalian cells(19.Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that Ran-GTP (but not Ran-GDP) dissociated the karyopherin heterodimer and associated with karyopherin β although the stoichiometry of this association was not determined(20.Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Ran-GTP-mediated dissociation of the karyopherin heterodimer did not require GTP hydrolysis(20.Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). An association of Ran-GTP with karyopherin β might affect the responsiveness of Ran-GTP to Ran regulatory proteins. As a RanGAP has recently been identified (17.Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and in yeast is the product of the RNA1 gene(21.Bischoff F.R. Krebber H.

Using all recombinant proteins, we found that karyopherin β inhibited RanGAP-stimulated Ran-GTP hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent manner, yielding complete inhibition at karyopherin β concentrations that are stoichiometric to Ran-GTP. In gel filtration experiments, we found that karyopherin β was capable of forming a stoichiometric complex with Ran-GTP but of binding only weakly to Ran-GDP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Purification of Recombinant Yeast Ran (Gsp1)The GSP1 gene (23.Belhumeur P. Lee A. Tam R. DiPaolo T. Fortin N. Clark M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2152-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA (Promega) using the primers 5′-ATA TCC ATG GCT TCT GCC CCA GCT GCT AAC-3′ and 5′-GTT GGA TCC TTA TAA ATC AGC ATC ATC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into NcoI-BamHI-digested pET21d vector (Novagen). The plasmid was introduced into E. coli strain BLR(DE3) (Novagen). Recombinant Ran was purified as follows. Cells were grown in 2 liters of LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin at 37°C to a cell density of 0.6 A600 unit. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to 0.1 mM to induce expression of the protein. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g at 4°C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of ice-cold Tris buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT. Aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin were added to 1 μg/ml and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 0.1 mM. All subsequent operations were carried out at 4°C. Cells were lysed in a French pressure cell at 9,000 psi, and the lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g. Ran was precipitated from the supernatant at 25-55% ammonium sulfate saturation and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of Tris buffer and dialyzed overnight against Tris buffer. To load that fraction of Ran that might be free of nucleotide, the dialyzed fraction was incubated in the presence of 0.5 mM GTP and 10 mM MgCl2 for 10 min at 4°C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g, the cleared supernatant was subjected to chromatography on a Mono Q FPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient from 0-500 mM NaCl in Tris buffer. Ran eluted between 230 and 280 mM NaCl as assayed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing Ran were pooled (~2 ml) and concentrated in a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon) to 100 μl. This solution was sieved on a Superdex 75 FPLC column (HR 30/10; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mM KOAc, 2 mM MgOAc, 1 mM EGTA, and 2 mM DTT). Peak fractions containing 1-2 mg/ml Ran were pooled (~2 ml), and 20-μl aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.Determination of GTP/GDP Bound to Recombinant Ran (Gsp1)Aliquots of frozen Ran solution were applied to a Beckman System Gold and a C18 reversed-phase column (4.6 mm × 15 cm; Rainin) equilibrated with buffer B (100 mM triethylamine, pH 6.5, phosphoric acid). Using a gradient from 0-20% acetonitrile in buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, GDP eluted at 8.6 min and GTP at 9.4 min. Quantitation was by measuring A254.Purification of Yeast RanGAP (Rna1)The RNA1 gene (24.Traglia H.M. Atkinson N.S. Hopper A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2989-2999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from yeast genomic DNA using synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-TTA GGA TCC GCT ACC TTG CAC TTC GTT-3′ and 5′-CCA GAA TTC ATT GTG CTA CTT GGA GCC-3′ introducing a BamHI site in-frame with the initiation codon and an EcoRI site after the stop codon. The BamHI-EcoRI fragment was ligated into vector pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and thereby fused with the glutathione S-transferase gene (GST). The plasmid was introduced into E. coli strain BLR(DE3). For purification of the recombinant RanGAP, cells were grown in 2 liters of LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin at 30°C to a cell density of 0.5 A600 units. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to 0.2 mM, and cells were grown for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g at 4°C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.3, 1 mM DTT). Cells were lysed using a French pressure cell, and the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was applied to a 1-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in PBS at 4°C. After washing with 100 ml of PBS, the GST-fusion protein was cleaved on the column by incubation at 21°C for 12 h with 10 NIH units of thrombin. The eluate of 1.5 ml contained 0.9 mg/ml protein, and 50-μl aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.Purification of Karyopherin β (Kap95)Recombinant Kap95 was purified as described previously(19.Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Labeling of Ran with [γ-32P]GTP5 μM Ran was incubated for 30 min on ice with 30 nM [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) in exchange buffer containing 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, and 100 mM KOAc in a final volume of 100 μl followed by the addition of 20 mM MgCl2. Unbound nucleotide was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column prepared in a 1-ml syringe equilibrated with hydrolysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 100 mM KOAc, 20 mM MgOAc, 1 mM DTT, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). This yielded ~100 μl of 1.5 μM Ran solution containing 200 nM Ran-[γ-32P]GTP as determined on the reversed-phase column.GAP AssayTo measure GAP activity, 40 nM Ran-[γ-32P]GTP was incubated either in the absence or presence of various amounts of RanGAP in hydrolysis buffer in a final volume of 100 μl at 21°C for 10 min. After incubation, 20-μl aliquots were diluted into 1 ml of ice-cold hydrolysis buffer and filtered through nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell). Filters were washed with 5 ml of hydrolysis buffer and dried, and radioactivity was counted in the presence of 3 ml of scintillation fluid (Ready Safe, Beckman) on a Wallac 1410 scintillation counter.Determination of Complex Formation between Kap95 and Ran-GTP or Ran-GDPFor these experiments, the nucleotide exchange reaction for Ran was done in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of either GDP or GTP over Ran. To allow for complex formation, 2.5 μM Kap95 and either 5 μM Ran-GTP or Ran-GDP was incubated in a final volume of 200 μl of buffer A for 10 min at 21°C. The reaction mixture was then subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (HR30/10; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by staining of the gel with Coomassie Blue.In a control experiment, Ran was first labeled with either [3H]GDP or [γ-32P]GTP. For this, 10 μM Ran was incubated in the presence of either 10 nM [3H]GDP (34 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) or 10 nM [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) in exchange buffer for 30 min at 21°C. This resulted in labeled Ran that contained 16% GTP and 20% GDP, as determined on the reversed-phase column. After addition of 20 mM Mg(OAc)2, 5 μM Ran-[3H]GDP or 5 μM Ran-[γ-32P]GTP was incubated with 2.5 μM Kap95 for 10 min at 21°C. The reaction mixture was subjected to gel filtration as described, and the elution of radioactivity was monitored by measuring 10-μl aliquots of each fraction in a scintillation counter.Protein ConcentrationsThese were determined by the method of Bradford (25.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213426) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.RESULTSRan (Gsp1), RanGAP (Rna1), and karyopherin β (Kap95), all from S. cerevisiae, were expressed as recombinant proteins in E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each of the purified recombinant proteins yielded a single band of the expected electrophoretic mobility upon SDS-PAGE analysis (see Fig. 1 for purified RanGAP and Fig. 4 for purified Ran and karyopherin β). The purified recombinant Ran was determined to contain 40% GDP and 25% GTP, whereas 35% is nucleotide-free (data not shown). To assay for GTP hydrolysis, the endogenous Ran-bound GDP or GTP were in part exchanged with [γ-32P]GTP (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under the conditions used for the exchange reaction (no exogenously added cold GTP), we found that only about 13% of the Ran was complexed with GTP, as determined by measuring the bound nucleotide on a reversed-phase column. Hence, of the 300 nM Ran used in the incubation reaction with RanGAP, only about 40 nM was present as Ran-GTP. After incubation with RanGAP, GTP hydrolysis was measured using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay in which hydrolyzed 32PO4 is not retained by the filter, whereas Ran-bound nonhydrolyzed [γ-32P]GTP is retained. The recombinant GAP was indeed active. Increasing concentrations yielded increasing rates of GTP hydrolysis, with as little as 1.0 nM GAP yielding more than 70% GTP hydrolysis and 2.0 nM GAP resulting in near 100% GTP hydrolysis within the 10-min reaction time (Fig. 2). Strikingly, in the presence of 40 nM karyopherin β, the GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis was completely inhibited (Fig. 2).Figure 4:Ran forms a complex with karyopherin β (Kap95) that can be detected by gel filtration. Complex formation between Ran and Kap95 was analyzed on a Superdex 200 FPLC column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 13 of 24 fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A, fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. Upper panel, 2.5 μM Kap95 was incubated in buffer A. Middle panel, 2.5 μM Kap95 was incubated with 5 μM Ran-GTP. Lower panel, 2.5 μM Kap95 was incubated with 5 μM Ran-GDP. B, 2.5 μM Kap95 was incubated with 5 μM Ran-[3H]GDP (open circles) or 5 μM Ran-[γ-32P]GTP (closed circles). Elution of radioactivity was monitored by counting 10-μl aliquots of each of the 24 fractions in a scintillation counter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2:GAP activity is inhibited by karyopherin β (Kap95).

Inhibition of GAP activity was maximal at 30 to 40 nM karyopherin β (Fig. 3). Increasing the concentration of RanGAP did not overcome the inhibition of karyopherin β (Fig. 2). These data suggested that karyopherin β did not inhibit GAP activity by interacting with RanGAP directly, but rather by forming a stoichiometric complex with Ran-GTP.Figure 3:Inhibition of GAP activity is dependent on karyopherin β (Kap95) concentration. GAP activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” after incubating 40 nM Ran[γ-32P]GTP in the presence of 1 nM RanGAP and increasing amounts of Kap95.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assay directly for an association of Ran with karyopherin β, we carried out gel filtration experiments. For these experiments, the endogenous Ran-bound GDP or GTP was exchanged in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of either GTP or GDP to ensure that most of the Ran would be bound either to GTP or GDP. To allow for complex formation, 2.5 μM karyopherin β was incubated either with 5.0 μM Ran-GTP or Ran-GDP. In a control reaction, 2.5 μM karyopherin β was incubated without Ran-GTP or Ran-GDP. Each of the reaction mixtures was then subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 FPLC column, and fractions were collected, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining of the gel. The bulk of karyopherin β eluted at fractions 12 and 13 (Fig. 4A, upper panel). When preincubated with a 2-fold molar excess of Ran-GTP, there was a dramatic shift of the karyopherin β peak to fractions 10 and 11. Moreover, karyopherin β coeluted with about half of the Ran-GTP, whereas the other half of Ran-GTP peaked at fraction 18 (Fig. 4A, middle panel). These data indicated that karyopherin β and Ran-GTP formed a stoichiometric complex. Some binding to karyopherin β could also be detected when Ran was loaded with GDP prior to incubation (Fig. 4A, lower panel). However, we found that under our exchange conditions there was still about 10% GTP bound to Ran, as determined on the reversed-phase column. To determine whether there was indeed binding of Ran-GDP to karyopherin β, Ran was labeled with [3H]GDP prior to incubation with karyopherin β. Gel filtration on the Superdex 200 column resulted in cofractionation of some of the radioactivity with the karyopherin β-Ran complex (Fig. 4B, open circles). When Ran was labeled with [γ-32P]GTP prior to incubation with karyopherin β, all of the labeled Ran cofractionated with the karyopherin β-Ran complex (Fig. 4B, closed circles). These results indicated that Ran-GDP also binds to karyopherin β, but with much lower affinity than does Ran-GTP.DISCUSSIONOur data here show that the RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis of Ran-GTP is inhibited by karyopherin β in a concentration-dependent manner. Complete inhibition was observed when the amount of karyopherin β was equimolar to Ran-GTP. In gel filtration experiments, Ran-GTP and karyopherin β were found to form a stoichiometric complex. We suggest that binding of Ran-GTP to karyopherin β renders Ran-GTP inaccessible to RanGAP.Ran-GTP binding to karyopherin β does not appear to affect the slow intrinsic GTPase activity of Ran, as no differences in the rates of GTP hydrolysis could be detected during a 1-h incubation of Ran-GTP either in the absence or presence of karyopherin β (data not shown).Unlike Ras, which has an affinity for GTP that is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that for GDP(26.Neal S.E. Eccleston J.F. Hall A. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19718-19722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ran has a 10-fold higher affinity for GDP than it has for GTP(27.Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Up to 80% of the cellular Ran is thought to be located in the nucleus(28.Ren M. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas RanGAP is thought to be located in the cytoplasm(29.Hopper A.K. Traglia H.M. Dunst R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Hence, the cytoplasmic RanGAP is likely to keep the cytoplasmic concentration of Ran-GTP very low. This seems logical as cytoplasmic Ran-GTP would be detrimental for nuclear import. It would dissociate the karyopherin heterodimer in the cytoplasm, associate with karyopherin β, and thereby prevent targeting of NLS protein to the nuclear pore complex(20.Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar).The formation of a complex between Ran-GTP and karyopherin β that renders Ran-GTP inaccessible to RanGAP is reminiscent of the formation of a complex of Ras-GTP with its downstream effector Raf kinase that has been proposed to render Ras-GTP inaccessible to RasGAP(30.Warne P.H. Viciana P.R. Downward J. Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 31.Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Ras-Raf interaction is thought to be terminated through intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of Ras-GTP, resulting in the release of Raf kinase(32.Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Similarly, the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ran could result in a dissociation of Ran from karyopherin β as the affinity of the latter for Ran-GDP is lower than for Ran-GTP (Fig. 4).It remains to be determined whether (Ran-GTP•karyopherin β) complex formation might serve to down-regulate protein import into the nucleus in vivo. INTRODUCTIONSeveral soluble transport factors are required for import of a nuclear localization sequence (NLS)( 1The abbreviations used are: NLSnuclear localization sequenceGAPGTPase activating proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDTTdithiothreitolFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered saline.) -containing protein into nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized mammalian cells. Binding of the NLS protein to the nuclear rim of digitonin-permeabilized cells is mediated by a heterodimeric complex, termed karyopherin(1.Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar)). Transport of the NLS protein from the nuclear rim into the nucleus requires the Ras-related GTPase Ran (10.Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 11.Melchior F.B. Paschal J. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and a Ran-interactive homodimeric complex of a protein of 15 kDa that migrates in SDS-PAGE as a protein of 10 kDa and therefore has been termed p10 (12.Moore M.S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) (p10 is synonymous with NTF 2(13.Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar)). These four transport factors are able to substitute for the requirement of cytosol in import of an NLS protein into nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells, even when prepared from Escherichia coli as recombinant proteins(14.Moroianu J. Hijikata M. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6532-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is likely that additional soluble factors are required. These factors may remain with the digitonin-permeabilized cells in sufficient quantities and therefore not be limiting or they may perform subtle regulatory tasks that have not yet been detected with this assay. Among these factors might be several Ran regulatory proteins, such as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor(15.Nishimoto T. Eilen E. Basilico C. Cell. 1978; 15: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16.Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H.

Nature. 1993; 366: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).A heterodimeric karyopherin has also been isolated from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and recombinant karyopherin α and β subunits have been shown to be able to dock NLS protein at the nuclear rim of digitonin-permeabilized mammalian cells(19.Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that Ran-GTP (but not Ran-GDP) dissociated the karyopherin heterodimer and associated with karyopherin β although the stoichiometry of this association was not determined(20.Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Ran-GTP-mediated dissociation of the karyopherin heterodimer did not require GTP hydrolysis(20.Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). An association of Ran-GTP with karyopherin β might affect the responsiveness of Ran-GTP to Ran regulatory proteins. As a RanGAP has recently been identified (17.Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and in yeast is the product of the RNA1 gene(21.Bischoff F.R. Krebber H.

Using all recombinant proteins, we found that karyopherin β inhibited RanGAP-stimulated Ran-GTP hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent manner, yielding complete inhibition at karyopherin β concentrations that are stoichiometric to Ran-GTP. In gel filtration experiments, we found that karyopherin β was capable of forming a stoichiometric complex with Ran-GTP but of binding only weakly to Ran-GDP."

https://openalex.org/W2154172993,"In response to stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor human SOS1 (hSOS1) promotes the activation of Ras by forming a complex with Grb2 and the human EGF receptor (hEGFR). hSOS1 was phosphorylated in cells stimulated with EGF or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or following co-transfection with activated Ras or Raf. Co-transfection with dominant negative Ras resulted in a decrease of EGF-induced hSOS1 phosphorylation. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylated hSOS1 <i>in vitro</i> within the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich domain. The same region of hSOS1 was phosphorylated <i>in vivo</i>, in cells stimulated with EGF. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping showed that MAPK phosphorylated hSOS1 <i>in vitro</i> on sites which were also phosphorylated <i>in vivo</i>. Phosphorylation by MAPK did not affect hSOS1 binding to Grb2 <i>in vitro.</i> However, reconstitution of the hSOS1-Grb2-hEGFR complex showed that phosphorylation by MAPK markedly reduced the ability of hSOS1 to associate with the hEGFR through Grb2. Similarly, phosphorylated hSOS1 was unable to form a complex with Shc through Grb2. Thus phosphorylation of hSOS1, by affecting its interaction with the hEGFR or Shc, down-regulates signal transduction from the hEGFR to the Ras pathway."

Recruitment of these cells to a tissue site is a complex process that depends in part upon the local expression of appropriate proinflammatory chemokines. Macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), a member of the CC subfamily of chemokines, has been shown to contribute to monocyte/macrophage and neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. Our previous work demonstrated that MIP-1α mRNA expression in macrophages is induced by bacterial endotoxin. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that an oxidative stress alone may trigger expression of MIP-1α mRNA in macrophages and to determine the mechanism leading to increased expression. A rat alveolar macrophage cell line (NR8383) was exposed to H2O2 or menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (MQ)), a quinone compound that undergoes redox cycling and generates reactive oxygen species continuously. Steady-state mRNA levels encoding MIP-1α were markedly increased (3-fold) in these cells after 1 h of exposure to 0.5 mM H2O2, remained higher than control levels after 4 h, and decreased after 6 h. Similarly, MQ (25 or 50 μM) caused a significant increase of MIP-1α mRNA with a maximal induction after 4 h of exposure (5-fold). Both H2O2 and MQ-induced up-regulation of MIP-1α mRNA was suppressed by co-treatment with N-acetylcysteine, a synthetic antioxidant. Co-treatment with actinomycin D reduced the MQ induction of MIP-1α mRNA to a greater extent than the H2O2-induced increase. Transcription of the MIP-1α gene was increased by exposure to both H2O2 and MQ. H2O2 treatment also induced a marked increase of the MIP-1α mRNA half-life, indicating post-transcriptional stabilization. These observations indicate that an oxidative stress can regulate MIP-1α mRNA expression by two distinct mechanisms: transcriptional activation of the MIP-1α gene and post-transcriptional stabilization of MIP-1α mRNA.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( 1The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesMIPmacrophage inflammatory proteinMQmenadioneNACN-acetylcysteineRAMrat alveolar macrophage.) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several lung diseases including adult respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and lung fibrosis (reviewed by Halliwell and Gutterage(1989)). Increased production of ROS is believed responsible for tissue damage during pulmonary inflammation (Southern and Powis, 1988). Inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages play an important role in host defense but may also contribute to tissue injury through the release of tissuedamaging oxidants upon activation (reviewed by Sibille and Reynolds(1990)). In addition, activated inflammatory cells also produce mediators such as prostanoids and leukotrienes that can induce bronchoconstriction. Thus, leukocytes that are recruited into the lung and subsequently activated have profound effects on cells within the lung and may propagate inflammation. reactive oxygen species macrophage inflammatory protein menadione N-acetylcysteine rat alveolar macrophage. Recruitment of inflammatory cells to a tissue site is a complex process that depends in part upon the local expression of appropriate chemoattractant proteins termed “chemokines” (reviewed by Oppenheim et al.(1991)). The chemokine superfamily can be subdivided into two subsets, which differ with respect to the relative positioning of the first two cysteines (CXC versus CC) at the N terminus. Macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), a member of the CC family of chemokines, contributes to monocyte/macrophage and neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. MIP-1α has been reported to be chemotactic for mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes (Davatelis et al., 1988; Wolpe and Cerami, 1989; Taub et al., 1993; VanOtteren et al., 1994). MIP-1α also induces a respiratory burst in neutrophils and plays a role in the control of hemopoietic stem cell proliferation (Graham et al., 1990; Dunlop et al., 1992). MIP-1α mRNA has been reported to be constitutively expressed at low levels and up-regulated by inflammatory stimuli in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (Shi et al., 1995). Recombinant MIP-1α administered to the lungs of rats elicits a localized neutrophilic inflammatory response that can be neutralized with anti-MIP-1α antibody in vitro (Shanley et al., 1995). These features make this chemokine a very likely participant in initiation of inflammation by noxious stimuli. A potential association specifically between oxidative stress and chemokine expression has been suggested (DeForge et al., 1992, 1993; Driscoll et al., 1993). Because of their role in pulmonary defense and their capacity for ROS production, alveolar macrophages are likely to be an important target for oxidative stress. Previous studies have shown that these cells are capable of expressing chemokines upon exposure to acute or chronic inflammatory stimuli (Huang et al., 1992a, 1992b; Farone et al., 1995; Shi et al., 1995). In this study we utilized a rat alveolar macrophage cell line to test the hypothesis that an oxidative stress alone can trigger expression of the chemokine MIP-1α and thus contribute to early inflammation. Macrophages were exposed to both H2O2 and MQ, and chemokine mRNA expression was measured in response to these oxidative stresses. In contrast to H2O2-induced oxidative stress, two major mechanisms are involved in quinone-induced cytotoxicity (reviewed by Brunmark and Cadenas(1989)). First, quinone is reduced to the hydroquinone or semiquinone radical by cellular reductase. The semiquinone radical undergoes rapid autoxidation with the generation of the parent quinone and concomitant formation of superoxide. The hydroquinone reacts rapidly with superoxide to form H2O2 and the semiquinone (Fridovich 1981; Shi et al., 1994a). Secondly, most quinones, including MQ, also react with cellular nucleophiles, such as thiols and amines, and cause cellular damage (Chang et al., 1992; Shi et al., 1993). We now demonstrate that both H2O2 and MQ induce MIP-1α mRNA expression in macrophages but through two distinct mechanisms. The up-regulation of MIP-1α mRNA by MQ is mediated through transcriptional activation of the MIP-1α gene. H2O2 induces MIP-1α mRNA expression by induction of MIP-1α gene transcription as well as by increasing the stability of the mRNA transcript. Tissue culture supplies and related materials were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The rat alveolar macrophage (RAM) cell line, NR8383, was generously provided by Dr. R. Helmke (Helmke et al., 1987). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% equine serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. Tissue culture plates were precoated with polyhydroxymethylacrylate to prevent cell adherence (Folkman and Moscona, 1987). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI for 4 h prior to treatment. MQ was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and subsequently diluted in RPMI medium. A 30% H2O2 stock was diluted in RPMI immediately before treatment. When used, MQ was added to tissue culture plates at a final concentration of 25 or 50 μM for 1-6 h. Control cells were treated with the same concentrations of Me2SO as the MQ treatment group. Me2SO levels did not exceed 0.01%. No significant cytotoxicity was identified for any oxidant treatment used in this study as measured by trypan blue assays. When used, 1 mMN-acetylcysteine (NAC) was added to cells and preincubated for 1 h in serum-free RPMI before addition of MQ or H2O2. In other studies, RAM cells were treated with MQ or H2O2 along with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D or 5 μg/ml cycloheximide for 1 or 4 h to inhibit cellular RNA and protein synthesis, respectively. Total cellular RNA was isolated from RAM cells using a modified guanidinum method (Chirgwin et al., 1979). Cells were lysed in 4 M guanidine thiocyanate/25 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0)/0.5% N-lauroyl-sarcosine/0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was layered on 5.7 M CsCl/0.1 M EDTA and centrifuged at 47,000 rpm (268,000 × g) for 4 h in a Beckman SW55 Ti rotor. Pelleted RNA was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated TE buffer (10 mM Tris/1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). Total RNA (10 μg/lane) was denatured in 50% formamide/7% formaldehyde, resolved in a 1% agarose/7% formaldehyde gel, and transferred and UV cross-linked to nylon membranes (MSI Inc., Westboro, MA). MIP-1α cDNA (Shi et al., 1995) was labeled with [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) by random primer labeling (Life Technologies Inc.). Prehybridization (3 h) and hybridization with 32P-labeled MIP-1α cDNA (overnight) were carried out in 0.5 M NaPO4/1 mM EDTA/7% SDS/150 μg/ml tRNA (Church and Gilbert, 1984) at 65°C. Blots were washed once in 0.1 × SSC (20 × SSC = 3 M NaCl, 0.3 M Na3citrate)/0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice at 52°C before autoradiography and densitometry. The same blots were stripped of hybridized MIP-1α probe and rehybridized with a radiolabeled cDNA fragment of mouse β-actin cDNA (ATCC, Rockville, MD) as an internal control. Following treatment of RAM cells with 25 μM MQ for 4 h or 0.5 mM H2O2 for 1 h as above, actinomycin D was added to the media to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Cells were sampled at times indicated through 6 h, and the levels of MIP-1α mRNA were quantified by Northern analysis. The integrated band values, as determined by densitometry, were normalized to β-actin RNA. RAM cells were treated with 0 or 0.5 mM H2O2 or 0 or 50 μM MQ as described above. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the nuclei were released by lysis in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (Ausbel et al., 1990). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation and stored in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA in liquid nitrogen. Upon thawing, nuclei were resuspended and incubated in reaction buffer (1× containing 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM (NH4)2SO4, 4 mM MgCl2, 200 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 4 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.2 mM dithiothreitol), 1 mM each of ATP, GTP, and CTP, and 150 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) (DuPont NEN) at 30°C for 30 min, followed by 100 units DNase I treatment for 20 min at 30°C. Proteinase K (100 μg) was then added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 42°C. RNA was then extracted using a RNA isolation kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA), and labeled free nucleotides were removed by centrifugation through a Sephadex G-50 spin minicolumn (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Equal amounts of newly transcribed RNA were hybridized with 5 μg of denatured, linearized MIP-1α or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs cross-linked to nitrocellulose membranes as described under “Northern Analysis.” A 0.8-kilobase pair rat MIP-1α cDNA in pCRII (Shi et al., 1995) and a 1.2-kilobase pair human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA in pBR322 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were used in this assay. RAM cells were exposed to H2O2 up to 6 h, and steady-state mRNA levels encoding MIP-1α were measured by Northern analysis. Levels of MIP-1α mRNA were rapidly induced as early as 1 h following exposure to 0.5 mM H2O2, remained higher than controls after 4 h of exposure, and returned to the control level by 6 h (Fig. 1). H2O2 at 0.1 mM did not induce a change in MIP-1α mRNA levels. RAM cells were also treated with a second source of reactive oxygen radicals, MQ, and MIP-1α mRNA levels were again quantified. MQ undergoes redox cycling and generates reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 and O2 continuously. MQ at both 25 and 50 μM also caused an induction of MIP-1α mRNA levels at 1 h, which persisted through 4 h of exposure with a maximum 5-fold increase over control levels (Fig. 2). After 6 h, MIP-1α mRNA levels had fallen back to near control levels at 25 μM MQ and were markedly reduced at 50 μM MQ (Fig. 2). NAC is a synthetic antioxidant that can replenish intracellular glutathione levels (Meister and Anderson, 1983). RAM cells were pretreated with 1 mM NAC for 1 h and then challenged with either MQ or H2O2. NAC at this level completely eliminated the induction of MIP-1α mRNA induction by 25 and 50 μM MQ (Fig. 3). In a similar fashion, NAC treatment partially attenuated the induction of MIP-1α mRNA by 0.5 mM H2O2 at both 1 and 4 h postexposure (Fig. 4).Figure 4:Effect of NAC on MIP-1α mRNA levels in response to H2O2 in rat alveolar macrophages. A, cells were incubated with 1 mM NAC for 1 h followed by the addition of 0.5 mM H2O2 for 1 or 4 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted and Northern analysis was performed as described for Fig. 1. Upper panels, autoradiogram of Northern blot hybridized with a radiolabeled MIP-1α cDNA.

To determine the route through which MQ and H2O2 elevate MIP-1α mRNA concentrations, we applied commonly used translational and transcriptional inhibitor assays as described previously (Shi et al., 1994a, 1994b). RAM cells were exposed to 25 μM MQ in the presence of 5 μg/ml cycloheximide for 4 h to inhibit protein synthesis. Total cellular RNA was extracted and Northern analysis was performed. Cycloheximide alone caused a significant increase in MIP-1α mRNA levels, and did not appear to inhibit the induction of MIP-1α mRNA levels in response to MQ or H2O2 (Fig. 5). These results only suggest that an increase of MIP-1α mRNA by MQ-induced oxidative stress may not be dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Experiments were also performed in the presence of actinomycin D to inhibit transcription. RAM cells were exposed to 25 μM MQ for 4 h or 0.5 mM H2O2 for 1 h in the presence or the absence of 5 μg/ml actinomycin D. The elevation of MIP-1α mRNA by MQ was almost completely blocked by co-incubation with actinomycin D, suggesting that the increase by oxidative stress is transcriptionally regulated (Fig. 6, A and C). In contrast, actinomycin D only partially (~60%) suppressed the increase of MIP-1α mRNA expression by H2O2 (Fig. 6, B and D), suggesting that mRNA stability may also play an important role in the up-regulation of MIP-1α transcript levels. Because transcriptional regulation of the MIP-1α gene by ROS was suggested by results obtained with actinomycin D, we performed nuclear run-on transcriptional rate assays to confirm the role of this mechanism in regulation of mRNA expression. RAM cells were treated with 0 or 0.5 mM H2O2 or 0 or 50 μM MQ for 1 and 4 h. Cell nuclei were extracted, and transcription rates for the MIP-1α gene were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At 1 h post-treatment, transcription of the MIP-1α gene markedly increased following treatment with both 0.5 mM H2O2 and 50 μM MQ (Fig. 7). After 4 h, the transcriptional rate of the MIP-1α gene in MQ-treated cells was further increased; however, MIP-1α transcription in H2O2-treated cells had returned to near control levels. Hybridization to nonspecific, prokaryotic sequences (pBR322) was not evident. These results indicate that the observed induction of MIP-1α mRNA by both H2O2 or MQ is at least in part caused by transcriptional activation of the gene. The MIP-1α mRNA 3′-untranslated region contains six copies of the reiterated AUUUA motifs (Shi et al., 1995) that are typically conserved in these regions of cytokines and growth factors mRNAs and are implicated in mRNA stability and translational control (Shaw and Kamen, 1986; Brewer, 1991). Our previous work suggested that the rapid up-regulation of MIP-1α mRNA by lipopolysaccharide treatment is the result of post-transcriptional regulation (Shi et al., 1995). The contribution of changes in MIP-1α mRNA stability to its increased expression in response to oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring MIP-1α mRNA half-life (t1/2). In the presence of actinomycin D, MIP-1α mRNA from untreated macrophages decayed quickly with a t1/2 of approximately 1 h (Fig. 8). H2O2 treatment significantly increased the half-life of MIP-1α mRNA, with a t1/2 greater than 6 h. MQ treatment did not change the t1/2 of MIP-1α mRNA in comparison with the control. These observations are in agreement with the results of the actinomycin D (Fig. 6, A and B) and nuclear run-on studies (Fig. 7), suggesting that the induction of MIP-1α mRNA by MQ results from transcriptional activation, whereas the elevation of MIP-1α mRNA by H2O2 is the result of both transcriptional activation of the MIP-1α gene and post-transcriptional regulation of the mRNA. Induction of MIP-1α mRNA in alveolar macrophages by H2O2 or MQ strongly suggests a role for ROS in the regulation of chemokine gene expression. Although H2O2 is a direct source of oxidative stress, MQ undergoes redox cycling, leading to a gradual increase in ROS levels (Chang et al., 1992; Shi et al., 1993). Both MQ- and H2O2-induced increases in MIP-1α mRNA were suppressed by the antioxidant NAC, further confirming that oxidative stress alone could influence MIP-1α expression. Although a number of other recent studies have explored the possible modulation of chemokine expression by ROS (DeForge et al., 1992, 1993), most used an endotoxin challenge as a stimulus for oxidant stress. The significance of the present study is that it directly links the ROS to increased MIP-1α mRNA expression in the absence of endotoxin. Reactive oxygen species are now known to activate gene expression through modulation of the intracellular reduction-oxidation (redox) state of nuclear proteins. A number of site-specific DNA binding proteins have been identified whose redox state affects binding ability. Oxidative activation of a transcription regulatory protein was first identified in prokaryotes. cis-Acting elements in the 5′-flanking region of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium catalase and alkylhydroperoxide reductase genes are recognized by a trans-activator termed OxyR (Christman et al., 1989). Both reduced and oxidized OxyR binds the catalase promoter, but only the oxidized form activates transcription (Storz et al., 1990). In mammalian cells, ROS have also been implicated in the activation of the transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun (Abate et al., 1990), NF-κB/Rel (Schreck et al., 1991). A cis-acting regulatory sequence, the antioxidant response element, in the 5′-flanking region of the rat glutathione transferase Ya subunit gene and rat NAD(P)H:quinone reductase, has also been identified to be responsive to a variety of redox cycling xenobiotics and H2O2 (Rushmore et al., 1991; Favreau and Pickett, 1992). Constitutive antioxidant response element-binding factor(s) have been identified that are activated by ROS (Favreau and Picket, 1992). It has been reported that a neonatal rat lung protein forms specific complexes with catalase mRNA in a redox-sensitive manner. Neonatal rats exposed to hyperoxia show increased lung catalase mRNA stability associated with a larger proportion of catalase mRNA binding protein in oxidized form than from lungs of air-breathing neonatal rats (Clerch et al., 1991; Clerch and Massaro, 1992). These reports indicate that the intracellular redox state is crucial in the control of either active transcription factors or redox-sensitive proteins. Oxidant-induced conformational changes of regulatory proteins may influence a spectrum of genes by initiating transcription and/or stabilizing specific mRNAs. We performed inhibitor studies to identify whether increases in MIP-1α mRNA levels by oxidative stress were dependent on new RNA synthesis or de novo protein synthesis. Cycloheximide alone was able to markedly stimulate the accumulation of MIP-1α mRNA (Fig. 5), possibly suggesting that MIP-1α gene may be controlled either directly or indirectly by a repressor protein with a short half-life. Co-incubation with actinomycin D almost completely eliminated the increase of MIP-1α mRNA by MQ (Fig. 6A) and partially by H2O2, suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of the MIP-1α gene is involved. This suggestion was confirmed with nuclear run-on assays, which demonstrated increased transcriptional rates induced by MQ and H2O2 (Fig. 7). Although the 5′-flanking region of rat MIP-1α is presently unavailable, its murine counterpart contains an NF-κB-like binding region (Grove and Plumb, 1993). NF-κB is a multi-subunit transcription factor that can rapidly activate the expression of genes involved in inflammation and the acute phase immune response (Baeuerle and Baltimore, 1988). As described above, NF-κB has been previously reported to be activated by oxidative stress, including H2O2. MQ and H2O2 may also induce transcription of MIP-1α through cis-acting element(s) like antioxidant response element. Whether the transcriptional induction of MIP-1α by MQ and H2O2 is through an antioxidant response element-like element, an NF-κB binding region, or other 5′ sequences deserves further study. Stability of mRNA transcripts also plays an important role in the regulation of proinflammatory genes. Changes in turnover rate can affect steady-state levels over a relatively short period of time. As an example, the rapid, hyperoxia-induced elevation of lung catalase mRNA in neonatal rats is due to enhanced stability of its mRNA but not an increased rate of transcription (Clerch et al., 1991). In the present study, MIP-1α mRNA was elevated by H2O2 and MQ in an exceedingly short period of time (1 h), suggesting that MIP-1α mRNA turnover might be influenced by oxidative stress. Also of note, the 3′-untranslated regions of the rat MIP-1α mRNA contains six copies of reiterated AU-rich motifs (Shi et al., 1995), implicated in mRNA stability and translational control (Shaw and Kamen, 1986; Brewer, 1991). A cytoplasmic protein termed adenosine-uridine binding factor has been shown to bind specifically to the AUUUA motifs of in vitro transcribed RNAs and form exceptionally stable complexes (Malter, 1989). Moreover, the binding of adenosine-uridine binding factor to RNA templates is also redox-sensitive (Malter and Hong, 1991). To distinguish between an increase in transcriptional rate and stabilization of pre-existing transcripts of MIP-1α, we performed an RNA decay assay. MQ-induced elevation of MIP-1α mRNA has a t1/2 of less than 1 h, which is similar to that of control cells. On the contrary, MIP-1α mRNA from H2O2-treated cells has a t1/2 greater than 6 h (Fig. 8). Thus, the induction of MIP-1α mRNA by MQ is primarily through transcriptional activation of the MIP-1α gene, whereas the effect of H2O2 is through both transcriptional activation of the MIP-1α gene and the stabilization of MIP-1α mRNA. Post-transcriptional regulation of MIP-1α mRNA in macrophages has been previously reported following stimulation by bacterial endotoxin (Shi et al., 1995), which can also generate ROS (Adamson and Billings, 1990; Yoshikawa, 1990). It is noteworthy that two distinct mechanisms are involved in the regulation of MIP-1α gene expression; the one chosen is dependent on the specific stimulus. Enhanced stability of MIP-1α mRNA by H2O2 may be due to an mRNA binding protein whose confirmation, synthesis, or degradation is changed during an oxidative stress. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that an H2O2- and MQ-generated oxidative stress rapidly elevates MIP-1α mRNA expression in macrophages. The up-regulation of MIP-1α by MQ was apparently mediated through transcriptional activation of the MIP-1α gene. H2O2, on the other hand, induced MIP-1α mRNA expression by two mechanisms: transcriptional activation of the MIP-1α gene and stabilization of the MIP-1α mRNA."

Both forms of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) were slightly activated at 5 min, reached a maximum at 30 min, and remained significantly increased at 60 min of CCK stimulation. By contrast, p42mapkwas activated fully by 5 min. In pancreatic acini stimulated with different concentrations of CCK for 30 min, the minimal and maximal JNK responses were observed at 30 pM and 100 nM CCK, respectively; p42mapk activation was, as previously reported, much more sensitive, with maximal activation by 1 nM CCK. Carbachol and bombesin also stimulated JNK activity, while vasoactive intestinal peptide did not. Neither activating protein kinase C nor increasing intracellular Ca2+ significantly activated JNK. In in vivo experiments, rats were infused intravenously for 5 and 15 min with a secretory (0.1 μg/kg/h) or supramaximal (10 μg/kg/h) dose of the CCK analog caerulein (CER). Secretory doses of CER induced a 4-fold increase of both forms of JNK in pancreatic tissue at 5 and 15 min, while at the same time points, supramaximal stimulation with CER caused 4- and 27-fold increases, respectively, of these kinase activities. The secretory dose of CER slightly increased the activities of both forms of mitogen-activated protein kinase, while the supramaximal dose induced a 10-fold increase of p42mapk at 5 min. In conclusion, JNKs and mitogen-activated protein kinases are rapidly activated in rat pancreatic acini stimulated with CCK as well as in pancreatic tissue during in vivo stimulation with CER. The large response to supramaximal CER stimulation may be of importance in the early pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.

The kinases related to MAPKs were identified by virtue of their ability to phosphorylate the amino terminus of the c-Jun transcription factor, and they were therefore termed c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs)(7.Hibi M.

Two forms were identified with molecular masses of 46 and 55 kDa, both of which are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues, similar to the activation of MAPKs. JNKs can be potently activated by inhibitors of protein synthesis such as cycloheximide and anisomycin, inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor α, heat shock, changes in osmolarity, and ultraviolet irradiation and are also referred to as stress-activated protein kinases(8.Dérijard B.

Physiol. 1992; 263: G327-G332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation with a supramaximal dose of the CCK analog caerulein (CER) is known to induce acute pancreatitis in the rat(29.Lampel M. Kern H.F. Virchows Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histol. 1977; 373: 107-117Crossref Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The trigger and exact mechanism of this phenomenon are not completely understood. Recently, we found that CCK activates p42mapk and p44mapk as well as other upstream components of the MAPK signaling cascade, including Ras and MEK, in isolated rat pancreatic acini(30.Duan R.-D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Duan R.-D. Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1060-G1065PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate whether JNKs are activated in pancreatic acini as well as in pancreatic tissue during in vivo stimulation with CER and to compare their activation to that of MAPK.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe following reagents were purchased. Guanidine hydrochloride and minimal essential amino acids were from Life Technologies, Inc. Leupeptin and aprotinin were from Boehringer Mannheim. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) was a gift from the Squibb Research Institute (Princeton, NJ). Vasoactive intestinal peptide and bombesin were from Bachem California (Torrance, CA). Chromatographically purified collagenase was from Worthington. Caerulein was from Research Plus (Bayonne, NJ). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma.Preparation of Pancreatic Acini and Cell-free ExtractThe preparation of pancreatic acini was carried out according to Williams and co-workers(30.Duan R.-D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Williams J.A. Korc M. Dormer R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 253: E517-E524Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreata from Sprague-Dawley rats were digested by collagenase, mechanically dispersed, and passed through a 150-μm mesh nylon cloth. Acini were then purified by centrifugation at 50 × g for 3 min in a solution containing 4% bovine serum albumin and were resuspended in incubation buffer that consisted of a HEPES-buffered Ringer solution supplemented with 11.1 mM glucose, Eagle's minimal essential amino acids, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Acini were preincubated at 37°C with minimal shaking for 120 min, followed by stimulation with different agonists in 1-ml aliquots in 25 × 55-mm polystyrene vials for the indicated times. Acini were then pelleted; washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM Na3VO4, pH 7.4; and sonicated for 5 s in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4). The lysates were then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 4°C for 15 min, and the supernatant was assayed for MAPK and JNK activities. The amount of protein in the cell extracts was assayed by the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent.In Vivo Stimulation with CaeruleinUnder sterile conditions, rats were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). A polyethylene 50 cannula (Biolab Products, Lake Havasu City, AZ) was introduced through the femoral vein into the inferior vena cava. The cannula was tunneled subcutaneously and brought out behind the head in the cervical region to allow complete freedom of movement. The cannula potency was maintained by a heparin lock (1000 units/ml), and the animal was allowed to recover overnight, fasted with water ad libitum. The following morning, the cannula was flushed with 0.9% NaCl, and patency was confirmed by the entry of blood into the cannula following slight negative pressure. Rats with patent cannulas were infused with 0.9% NaCl (controls), a bolus secretory dose of CER equivalent to 0.1 μg/kg/h, or a supramaximal dose of CER equivalent to 10 μg/kg/h for 5 or 15 min. The animals were sacrificed by exsanguination, and pancreatic tissue samples were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer with the use of a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer.In-gel JNK and MAPK AssaysKinase assays on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were carried out by a modified method of Kameshita and Fujisawa(33.Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels (10%, 12.5 cm × 15.5 cm × 1 mm) were cast containing 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein or 0.3 mg/ml bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun-(1-79) fusion protein or GST. Plasmids (kindly provided by Jack Dixon, Biological Chemistry Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) were used to express the corresponding proteins in Escherichia coli strain TG1 cells according to Guan and Dixon(34.Guan K.-L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion protein (GST-c-Jun-(1-79)) and GST were purified from bacterial lysates with the use of glutathione-agarose beads as described previously(31.Duan R.-D. Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1060-G1065PubMed Google Scholar). Pancreatic extracts were boiled with sample buffer for 5 min, and equal amounts (20 μg of protein from pancreatic acini lysates and 40 μg of protein from pancreatic tissue homogenates) were subsequently submitted to electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, gels were washed with four changes of 125 ml of 20% isopropyl alcohol in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, to remove SDS and then with two changes of 125 ml of denaturing buffer containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The enzymes on the gel were renatured with four changes of 250 ml of renaturing buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 0.04% Tween 40, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol at 4°C for 20 h. The renatured gel was then incubated in assay buffer containing 40 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM EGTA at 30°C for 30 min. The kinase activity was determined by incubating the gel in 60 ml of the same buffer plus 20 μM ATP and 90 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by removal of the gel into 250 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate solution, followed by washing with the same solution nine times over a period of 2 h to eliminate nonspecific radioactivity in the gel. The activities of protein kinases were then measured in the dried gels with the use of a Model GS-250 molecular imager (Bio-Rad).RESULTSPreviously, we demonstrated that CCK rapidly activates MAPK in rat pancreatic acini(30.Duan R.-D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Duan R.-D. Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1060-G1065PubMed Google Scholar). Since anisomycin is known as a strong activator of another member of the MAPK family, JNKs, we decided to compare the effects of CCK and anisomycin in pancreatic acini. Using an in-gel kinase assay, we found that both agents significantly stimulated the activities of two kinases with apparent molecular masses of 46 and 55 kDa, which were able to phosphorylate GST-c-Jun-(1-79) (Fig. 1, left panel). The response to 10 nM CCK was in the same range of magnitude as observed after 30 min of stimulation with anisomycin (50 μg/ml). The same samples were subjected to the in-gel assay with GST copolymerized into the gel (Fig. 1, right panel). In the positions corresponding to 46 and 55 kDa, only very faint bands were occasionally visible, indicating slight phosphorylation of GST or minimal autophosphorylation of the kinases. Because of the mass, substrate specificity, and activation by anisomycin, these kinases can be identified as p46jnk and p55jnk, respectively. In-gel MAPK assay of the samples using myelin basic protein as substrate showed strong activation of both forms of MAPK (p42mapk and p44mapk) after CCK stimulation, while anisomycin had much less effect (data not shown).Fig. 2 presents the time course of CCK-induced activation of JNKs and MAPKs in pancreatic acini. In the upper panel of Fig. 2A, the radioactivity of the p46jnk and p55jnk bands is shown. The integrated density of the bands was calculated and is illustrated in the lower panel of Fig. 2A. CCK-8 slowly increased the activities of both JNKs, reaching a maximum at 30 min, when 2.5-fold increases of p46jnk and p55jnk activities were noted. The activity remained elevated at 45 min. In another experiment, activity was similar at 30 and 60 min. The same samples were subjected to in-gel MAPK assay. CCK-8 rapidly increased the activities of both MAPKs, reaching a maximum within 5 min, when 7.5- and 6-fold increases of p44mapk and p42mapk activities, respectively, were noted over the activities at time 0 (Fig. 2B). The activities of both kinases remained elevated at 45 min of CCK-8 stimulation.Figure 2:Time course of CCK-induced activation of JNKs (A) and MAPKs (B) in rat pancreatic acini. Acini were incubated with or without 10 nM CCK-8 for the indicated times and then sonicated in lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in stop solution. Samples were run separately on gels containing either GST-c-Jun-(1-79) or myelin basic protein, and in-gel kinase assays were performed in duplicate. The intensity of phosphorylation was measured with the use of a Model GS-250 molecular imager and is expressed as a percentage of the average value at time 0. The data presented are from one experiment that is representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pancreatic acini were then incubated for 30 min with different doses of CCK-8 (Fig. 3). The minimal response of JNKs to CCK stimulation was observed at a 30 pM concentration of the hormone, while half-maximal and maximal responses were observed at 3 and 100 nM, respectively (Fig. 3, A and C). The activities of both kinases remained elevated at 1 μM CCK. In the same samples, p42mapk and p44mapk activities were much more elevated at 30 pM CCK-8 compared with the effect on JNKs, reached a maximum at 1 nM, and remained at the similar level of activation up to 1 μM CCK-8 (Fig. 3, B and C).Figure 3:Concentration-dependent effect of CCK-8 on JNK (A and C) and MAPK (B and C) activities in rat pancreatic acini.

Yule D.I. Go V.L.W. DiMagno E.P. Gardner J.D. Lebenthal E. Reber H.A. Scheele G.A. Exocrine Pancreas. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1993: 167-189Google Scholar). We investigated whether one of these signal transduction pathways was responsible for activation of JNKs by determining the effects of various agonists on these kinase activities in comparison with the effect on the MAPK signaling pathway (Fig. 4). CCK, bombesin, and carbachol significantly stimulated the activities of both JNKs (Fig. 4A). The efficacy of CCK was ~2 times higher than that of bombesin and carbachol. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a potent stimulator of protein kinase C, as well as the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid had only a minimal effect on JNK activity, while vasoactive intestinal peptide, which stimulates pancreatic acini via a pathway related to cyclic AMP, had no effect. As shown before (30.Duan R.-D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar), CCK, bombesin, carbachol, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate significantly stimulated MAPK activity in pancreatic acini, while the effect of cyclopiazonic acid was much less. Incubation of acini with a combination of cyclopiazonic acid and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate resulted in additive effects on MAPK activity. Vasoactive intestinal peptide had no effect on MAPK activity in pancreatic acini.Figure 4:Effects of various agonists on JNK and MAPK activities in isolated rat pancreatic acini. Acini were stimulated for 30 min with the concentrations of the indicated agonists. The upper panels of A and B show representative autoradiographs. In the lower panels, the results are expressed as a percentage of control values, which were obtained in acini incubated without any stimulator for 30 min at 37°C.

Stimulation of rats with a secretory dose of CER (0.1 μg/kg) resulted in a significant 3-fold increase of both forms of JNK activity as early as 5 min of intravenous infusion, while at 15 min, the activities of these kinases were slightly higher. In the same animals, pancreatic p42mapk activity was increased 2-fold at 5 min, while at 15 min of stimulation, the levels returned to those seen in control animals infused with 0.9% NaCl. Stimulation with a supramaximal dose of CER (10 μg/kg), which is known to induce acute pancreatitis, induced a 4-fold increase of both JNKs at 5 min, while 15 min of stimulation resulted in a 27-fold elevation of these kinase activities. In the same animals, a 9-fold increase of p42mapk was observed in pancreatic tissue at 5 min, while at 15 min, it was significantly decreased, but remained at 2.5 times above control levels. It is noteworthy that basal levels of both JNKs and MAPKs appear much lower in the intact pancreas versus dispersed acini. Previously, we had found that basal levels of MAPK and JNK declined after a 2-h preincubation in vitro, suggesting that the preparation of acini increases the activities of both kinases from those found in the in situ pancreas.Figure 5:Effect of in vivo stimulation with CER on the activities of JNKs and MAPKs in rat pancreatic tissue. A and B show representative autoradiographs following infusion of saline (Control), 0.1 μg/kg/h CER (CER secr), or 10 μg/kg/h CER (CER supr). C shows the results expressed as a percentage of control values, which were obtained in rats intravenously injected with 0.9% NaCl and sacrificed after 5 or 15 min. The data for the 5-min groups of animals were obtained from two independent experiments (two rats each group), while the data for 15 min are presented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments (two rats each group).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe recently reported that CCK activates p42mapk and p44mapkas well as other upstream components of the MAPK signaling cascade, including Ras and MEK, in isolated rat pancreatic acini(30.Duan R.-D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Duan R.-D. Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1060-G1065PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated for the first time that CCK activates two forms of JNK (p46jnk and p55jnk) in isolated rat pancreatic acini. Interestingly, the effectiveness of CCK was the same or even higher than that of anisomycin, which is known as one of the strongest JNK activators(2.Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 13.Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7352-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In response to CCK, both JNKs were slowly activated in pancreatic acini, with maximum activation at 30 min, compared with p42mapk and p44mapk, which reached a maximum at 5 min. Furthermore, the minimal CCK concentration that activated JNKs was 10 times higher than that which activated the MAPKs (p42mapk and p44mapk) (30.Duan R.-D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar). Correspondingly, a 100 times greater CCK concentration was necessary to induce the maximal response of JNKs in pancreatic acini when compared with MAPKs. Thus, CCK activation of JNKs occurs slower and requires higher concentrations of CCK compared with the activation of MAPKs.Since JNKs are known to be activated by a signal cascade distinct from that of MAPKs, it is not surprising that there were some differences in the activation of JNKs and MAPKs in acini in response to intracellular messengers. In acini, CCK, carbachol, and bombesin are all known to interact with heterotrimeric G proteins and thereby activate a phospholipase C that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, generating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, which mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and activate protein kinase C, respectively. Increasing intracellular Ca2+ with cyclopiazonic acid failed to activate either JNKs or MAPKs. Activation of protein kinase C with active phorbol ester, which is known to stimulate MAPK activity in acini(30.Duan R.-D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar), had its expected effect, but showed a minimal effect on JNKs. Although CCK stimulates cAMP formation in acini at high concentrations, this does not appear to be important in activating JNKs as vasoactive intestinal peptide, which potently increases cAMP, had no effect. Thus, JNK activation cannot be explained by the intracellular mediators known to activate digestive enzyme secretion. Since CCK, carbachol, and bombesin all activate a variety of heterotrimeric G proteins, it seems likely that activation of the JNK cascade involves G proteins and diverges at that level from pathways activating enzyme secretion. It was recently reported that stimulation with carbachol activates JNKs and MAPKs in NIH 3T3 cells expressing muscarinic acetylcholine receptor(36.Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), which led the authors to suggest the existence of pathways leading to the activation of either MAPK or JNK. Recently, two independent groups have found that the monomeric GTP-binding proteins Rac and Cdc42 regulate the activity of the cascade leading to JNK activation(37.Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 38.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The authors of these studies suggested that G protein- and tyrosine kinase-linked receptors may activate Rac and Cdc42 directly or through activation of Ras. This then results in activation of a kinase cascade with MEK kinase-phosphorylating and -activating JNK kinase, which dually phosphorylates JNK(39.Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K.

Since MEK kinase and JNK kinase are expressed in most tissues, it seems likely that such a pathway occurs in acinar cells. An uncertainty in all types of cells is how MEK kinase is activated. Thus, how JNKs are activated in pancreatic acini remains to be determined, but our data clearly support the existence of a pathway distinct from that activating the MAPKs.In the in vivo part of our study, rats were stimulated intravenously with different doses of the CCK analog CER for 5 or 15 min. Stimulation with the lower dose of CER, known to stimulate pancreatic secretion, produced a mild increase of JNK activity in pancreatic tissue at 5 and 15 min. Under the same conditions, p42mapk and p44mapkwere only transiently activated at 5 min. These data suggest that both MAPKs and JNKs may be activated physiologically by CCK. Stimulation with a supramaximal dose of CER, known to induce acute pancreatitis, produced significant increases of p42mapk and p44mapk at 5 min of stimulation. This increased activity of both MAPKs was transient in that they were markedly decreased at 15 min. In the same group of animals, JNK activity was moderately elevated at 5 min and dramatically increased (27-fold) following 15 min of hyperstimulation. In our study, hyperstimulation both in vitro and in vivo was accompanied by significant activation of JNKs that may reflect the response to cellular stress. It is noteworthy that after CCK or CER stimulation in vitro as well as in vivo, the activation of p42mapk and p44mapk preceded the activation of JNKs. A similar phenomenom, in response to cellular stress, was recently observed by others in a rat model of kidney ischemia-reperfusion(44.Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26546-26551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These authors suggested that strong activation of the stress-activated protein kinase family of serine/threonine kinases very early after reperfusion of ischemic kidney may transduce an important signal to the nucleus and trigger the complex genetic response to ischemia. An important role of oxygen radicals is suggested in the early pathogenesis of both experimental models: CER-induced acute pancreatitis and organ ischemia-reperfusion (45.Schoenberg M.H. Büchler M. Beger H.G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1992; 12: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since it is also known that reactive oxygen species are capable of different protein kinase activation(46.Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 47.Huot J. Lambert H. Lavoie J.N. Guimond A. Houle F. Landry J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), it is possible that they may be partially responsible for the activation of MAPKs and JNKs in these experimental models.Taken together, CCK stimulation of dispersed acini or the intact pancreas stimulates two separate signaling cascades leading to activation of JNKs and MAPKs. The extensive activation of both MAPKs and JNKs during supramaximal in vivo stimulation with CER may be of importance in the early pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis and/or may reflect a universal reaction of the organism responding to cellular stress. INTRODUCTIONMitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ( 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKsmitogen-activated protein kinasesJNKsc-Jun amino-terminal kinasesCCKcholecystokininCCK-8CCK octapeptideCERcaeruleinMEKMAP kinase kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferase.) also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases, are serine/threonine protein kinases that are rapidly activated by a variety of cell-surface receptors(1.Davis R.J.

They function in signal cascade pathways that control the expression of genes involved in many cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation(3.Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar, 4.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Blocking the function of MAPK prevents cell proliferation in response to a number of growth-stimulating agents(5.Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Poyssegur J. Proc. Natl.

The kinases related to MAPKs were identified by virtue of their ability to phosphorylate the amino terminus of the c-Jun transcription factor, and they were therefore termed c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs)(7.Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, 8.Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.

Two forms were identified with molecular masses of 46 and 55 kDa, both of which are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues, similar to the activation of MAPKs. JNKs can be potently activated by inhibitors of protein synthesis such as cycloheximide and anisomycin, inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor α, heat shock, changes in osmolarity, and ultraviolet irradiation and are also referred to as stress-activated protein kinases(8.Dérijard B.

Kern H.F. Virchows Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histol. 1977; 373: 107-117Crossref Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The trigger and exact mechanism of this phenomenon are not completely understood. Recently, we found that CCK activates p42mapk and p44mapk as well as other upstream components of the MAPK signaling cascade, including Ras and MEK, in isolated rat pancreatic acini(30.Duan R.-D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Duan R.-D. Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1060-G1065PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate whether JNKs are activated in pancreatic acini as well as in pancreatic tissue during in vivo stimulation with CER and to compare their activation to that of MAPK."

Four hours after the injection of [35S]methionine/cysteine into the vitreous, 44% of [35S]Met/Cys-labeled apoE is in soluble and membrane-enclosed retinal fractions, while 50% is in the vitreous. A significant amount of intact [35S]Met/Cys-labeled apoE is rapidly transported into the optic nerve and its terminals in the lateral geniculate and superior colliculus within 3-6 h in two distinguishable vesicular compartments. Müller glia in cell culture also synthesize and secrete apoE. Taken together, these results suggest that apoE is synthesized by Müller glia and secreted into the vitreous.

We discuss the possible roles of retinal apoE in neuronal dynamics. ApoE, a 36-kDa glycoprotein, is a component of a number of circulating plasma lipoproteins, including very low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins, and chylomicron remnants(1.Mahley R. Science. 1989; 240: 622-630Crossref Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). Its primary function appears to be that of a recognition ligand for the receptor-specific removal of cholesteryl ester-rich lipoproteins from the circulation(2.Shervill B. Innerarity T. Mahley R. J.

Science. 1989; 240: 622-630Crossref Scopus (3386) Google Scholar)). In plasma, apoE transports lipoproteins containing cholesterol, triglycerides and other lipids to various cells via binding to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) ( 1The abbreviations used are: LDLlow density lipoproteinLRPLDL receptor-related proteinAPPβ-amyloid precursor proteinRGCretinal ganglion cellON/OToptic nerve(s)/optic tract(s)GFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinLGNlateral geniculate nucleus.) receptor (7.Hui D.

In the central nervous system, apoE is primarily synthesized by the major glial cell, the astrocyte, in rodents and humans (10.Pitas R. Boyles J. Lee S. Foss D. Mahley R. Biochim. Biophys.

Since apolipoprotein B, the other molecule that can mediate the internalization of lipoproteins via association with the LDL receptor, is not synthesized in the central nervous system (reviewed in (6.Poirier J.

We have employed the in vivo rabbit retina to probe the synthesis, intracellular transport, and metabolism of central nervous system proteins including kinesin, the motor for anterograde rapid transport(12.Morin P.J.

Since it has been shown recently that individuals having the ϵ4 allele of apoE are at high risk for Alzheimer's disease(16.Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D. Pericak-Vance M. Enghild J. Salvesen G. Roses A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1977-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar), we decided to use this widely accepted model of normal adult retinal protein synthesis and metabolism (e.g.(17.Willard M. Cowan W.M. Vagelos P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2183-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and (18.Sjostrand J. Karlsson J.-O. J. Neurochem. 1969; 16: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)) to examine the synthesis and transport of apoE. In this report, we present evidence, obtained by the injection of [35S]methionine/cysteine into the vitreous chamber that overlies the retina, that apoE is synthesized in significant quantities in vivo by rabbit Müller cells, the predominant glial cell of the retina. ApoE is then transferred, presumably after secretion, into the vitreous. A substantial quantity of newly synthesized apoE is also subsequently transported as an intact molecule into the optic nerve by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) through vesicular anterograde rapid transport. We discuss the possible role of this pathway in axonal lipid metabolism and the possible interactions of apoE with APP or its metabolites. The methods of isotope injection, membrane isolation, and density gradient analysis of rabbit optic nerve and retina have been used in our laboratory for several years and are detailed in several reports (e.g.(14.Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and (19.Morin P.J. Liu N. Johnson R.J. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). Adult male albino rabbits (6 pounds) were anesthetized with 1 ml of 5% sodium pentobarbital (intravenous), and 2 drops of local anesthetic (0.5% proparacaine HCl) were put in each eye. One hundred-unit insulin syringes with 28-gauge needles were used to introduce 0.5 mCi (50 μl) of [35S]Met/Cys into the vitreous of one or both eyes. The animals awakened within 1-2 h and showed no signs of discomfort or redness of the eye. At the various times following injection of label, subcellular fractionation was done using a modification of the method of Lorenz and Willard(20.Lorenz T. Willard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Within 10 min of sacrifice by intravenous injection of 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, optic nerves and optic tracts (ON/OT) were rapidly dissected and placed in 7 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (1 mM triethanolamine, 320 mM sucrose) containing 30 units/ml phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin. Homogenization consisted of three strokes in a motor-driven Teflon/glass homogenizer (0.005-inch clearance) in a volume of 7 ml, followed by three strokes in a glass Dounce homogenizer in a volume of 10 ml. Homogenates were diluted to 40 ml with homogenization buffer and spun at 1200 × g for 7 min. The resulting supernatant was then spun at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of homogenization buffer and either used for immunoprecipitations directly or loaded onto a discontinuous gradient consisting of 2 ml each of 20/26/31/37/45% sucrose (w/w) in homogenization buffer. These gradients were spun at 150,000 × g in an SW 40 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 16 h. Twenty-four 0.5-ml fractions were collected from each gradient. A very similar protocol was employed for the retina(21.Morin P.J. Johnson R. Shachar I. Fine R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 632: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Protein determinations were carried out by the method of Bradford(22.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar). SDS gel electrophoresis was performed on 10 or 10-20% gels by the method of Laemmli(23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Gels were prepared for autoradiography by immersing them in Resolution (EM Science), followed by drying for 1 h under vacuum as described(19.Morin P.J. Liu N. Johnson R.J. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Films were exposed for appropriate times and developed in an automatic processor. Densitometry was carried out using a Pharmacia Biotech laser densitometer. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously(19.Morin P.J. Liu N. Johnson R.J. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were dissolved in 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and undissolved material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with agitation with the appropriate primary antibody previously bound to Sepharose bead-linked anti-IgG. The beads were then centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge and washed six times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 M NaCl. The final samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Quantitation of gels was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, or that of films using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer. Müller glial cells were cultured from adult white rabbits following the procedure described previously by Edwards et al.(24.Edwards R.B. Adler A.J. Dev S. Claycomb R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which was modified from the method of Lewis et al.(25.Lewis G.P. Erickson P. Kaska D. Fisher S.K. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Animals were killed by intravenous sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg). Eyes were enucleated, and the anterior half and vitreous were discarded. The retinas were removed, rinsed, cut into 4 × 4-mm fragments, and incubated for 30 min in 0.5 mg/ml protease Nagarse (Sigma) in Ca2+/Mg2--free balanced salt solution at 37°C. The tissue was rinsed, resuspended in balanced salt solution containing 0.1 mg/ml DNase and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and dissociated into a single-cell suspension by passing the retinal fragments through the mouth of a 10-ml plastic sterile pipette 10 times. The cells were gently centrifuged; resuspended in culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum); seeded in one-25 cm2 laminin-coated culture flask per two retinas; and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air. The medium was changed every 3-4 days. Retinal neurons that initially adhered to the surface of Müller cells were rinsed off with medium changes by 10 days in vitro, leaving a monolayer of glial cells. The cells were stained with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as described by Edwards et al.(24.Edwards R.B. Adler A.J. Dev S. Claycomb R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Incubation with all primary and secondary antibodies was for 1 h at room temperature. Fixation was with 10% Formalin for 30 min at room temperature. The primary antibody used was rabbit anti-bovine GFAP (1:100 dilution; Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). Purified nonimmune rabbit IgG (ICN) was used as a control in place of a GFAP. The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution; Cappel, Rockville, MD). Cultures were photographed using phase-contrast optics or conventional bright-field optics when only the opaque precipitate of the peroxidase stain needed to be photographed. Cells in 25-cm2 culture flasks were washed with Hanks' balanced saline and incubated with culture medium minus Met (Sigma) for 30 min. Then, 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys was added for 4 h. The medium was collected, and the cells were rinsed once with Hanks' balanced saline and dissolved in immunoprecipitation buffer. We injected 0.5 mCi of [35S]Met/Cys into each vitreous. Three hours later, we removed the retinas, vitreous, ON/OT, and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGNs). Membrane and soluble fractions from the retina and ON/OT and the liquid vitreous were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a specific antibody against rabbit apoE(26.Schreiber B. Jones H. Franzblau C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1177-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 1. We found a major polypeptide of 36 kDa specifically immunoprecipitated by the apoE antiserum from both the retinal membrane and soluble fractions. We also found a significant amount of the immunoprecipitated 36-kDa polypeptide in the ON/OT membrane fraction, but very little in the soluble fraction. We also detected the 36-kDa band in the LGN. A large quantity of the 36-kDa polypeptide was also specifically immunoprecipitated from the vitreous. We repeated the experiment using a 6-h interval between [35S]Met/Cys injection and sacrifice. A similarly significant quantity of specifically immunoprecipitated 36-kDa polypeptide was still found in the ON/OT membrane fraction and in the LGN, in addition to a significant amount of the immunoprecipitated 36-kDa polypeptide in the retinal fractions (Fig. 2). These results indicate that there is very active synthesis of apoE in the retina, and some of this apoE is rapidly transported down the ON/OT in transport vesicles. We still did not, however, find a detectable quantity of soluble apoE in the ON/OT. This suggests that apoE does not gain access to the axonal cytoplasm or the extracellular milieu of the ON/OT, at least for 6 h following synthesis and transport. These data provide strong evidence for the rapid transport of apoE into the optic nerve since detectable apoE reached the termination of the 3-cm long optic nerve within 3 h after synthesis, conforming to the known speed of rapid transport, 1 cm/h. Because we found little apparent quantitative difference in the amounts of apoE transported into the ON/OT at 3 and 6 h after [35S]Met/Cys injection, we chose an intermediate time point (4 h) to carry out a quantitative distribution of apoE in the various retinal and ON/OT fractions. Table 1 shows the results. As can be seen, over 50% of the total newly synthesized apoE was in the vitreous, while a slightly smaller quantity was in the retinal membranes, presumably from either the Müller cells or the RGCs and their proximal axons. A small but significant amount was also found in the ON/OT and LGN, indicating RGC uptake and/or synthesis and rapid transport. No counts were found in fractions taken from the uninjected vitreous, retina, and ON/OT, indicating that no transfer of apoE from blood or vitreal leakage occurred.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To characterize the type of transport vesicle that carries apoE into the optic nerve, we fractionated the ON/OT preparations isolated 3 and 6 h after [35S]Met/Cys injection by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously(14.Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19.Morin P.J. Liu N. Johnson R.J. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We obtained three discrete peaks of radioactivity. We have demonstrated previously that the peak with the lowest density (peak 1) contains plasma membrane; the peak of intermediate density (peak 2) contains transport vesicles bound for the plasma membrane as well as synaptic vesicle precursors that go to the nerve terminals; and the peak with the greatest density (peak 3) contains peptide granules that are also transported to the nerve terminals, but with significantly different kinetics(19.Morin P.J. Liu N. Johnson R.J. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When we immunoprecipitated apoE from the three peaks described above, we obtained the results shown in Fig. 3. At 3 h after labeling, all the apoE was found in peak 2, while after 6 h, radioactive apoE was found in both peaks 2 and 3. The most reasonable interpretation of these results is that apoE is carried into the axon in two distinct transport vesicles with different kinetic and biochemical properties. Given the evidence that, in other portions of the central nervous system, apoE is synthesized in astrocytes(10.Pitas R. Boyles J. Lee S. Foss D. Mahley R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), a reasonable interpretation of the data presented above is that the Müller glial cell, a bipolar glial cell that is the major glial cell of the retina, is a strong candidate cell type for apoE production. Its cell body is in the inner nuclear layer, and one process reaches the vitreal surface, while the other reaches the outer discs of the photoreceptors on the outside of the retina. These cells take up a significant quantity of vitreally injected [35S]Met/Cys and utilize it to synthesize proteins, including APP(14.Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We therefore cultured Müller cells from adult rabbits by the technique described by one of us(24.Edwards R.B. Adler A.J. Dev S. Claycomb R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These cells at early stages of growth have the bipolar appearance of Müller cells in vivo(24.Edwards R.B. Adler A.J. Dev S. Claycomb R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). They also stain positively for GFAP, a widely accepted marker for these cells. Routinely, our cultures are over 95% positive for this marker (Fig. 4). They are also positive for retinal-binding protein(24.Edwards R.B. Adler A.J. Dev S. Claycomb R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We labeled confluent Müller cells for 4 h with [35S]Met/Cys and carried out immunoprecipitation with anti-apoE with both cells and medium. The cells synthesized a 36-kDa polypeptide and secreted it into the medium (Fig. 5). The cells also produced a significant quantity of two high molecular mass isoforms of APP, which is also characteristic of Müller cells in vivo(14.Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The in vivo data presented here suggest that retinal apoE is synthesized at least in part by Müller glial cells and secreted into the vitreous and extracellular compartment of the retina. The apoE synthesized in the retina is also internalized by RGCs from the vitreous and extracellular space and/or synthesized by the RGCs. It is then transported into the axon by a vesicular anterograde rapid mechanism. The bipolar shape of the Müller cell, with a long process extending in each direction, allows it to secrete apoE at essentially any point in the retina, and Müller cells directly contact all nerve and photoreceptor cells in the retina. It is therefore ideally situated to supply apoE and any lipid moieties it associates with to all the cells of the retina including the RGCs. Since there appears to be a large pool of newly synthesized, soluble apoE in the retina itself and an even larger pool in the vitreous, it is likely that apoE is released directly into the vitreous as well as into the extracellular space of the retina. The axons of the RGCs, which are non-myelinated until they pass through the retina, lie in the perfect position to internalize the vitreal apoE, via surface receptors. Müller cells synthesize and secrete apoE in cell culture. Also in other regions of the central nervous system as well as in the periphery, apoE is synthesized mainly by glial cells and to some degree by macrophages, but not by neurons(6.Poirier J. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 525-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). However, there is still the possibility that the apoE we detected in the optic nerve in the brain has been synthesized by the RGCs themselves, although our data provide no evidence for this possibility. We hope to resolve this question by use of in situ RNA hybridization. We should also note that some of the apoE could be synthesized by retinal astrocytes that are associated with the RGC axons located near the center of the retina(27.Reichenbach A. Schippel K. Schumann R. Hagen E. J. Hirnforschung. 1988; 29: 481-491PubMed Google Scholar). These cells are, however, much less abundant than Müller cells. There are three possible sites of uptake for apoE on the retinal ganglion cell: the dendrites, the cell body, and the proximal axons of the RGCs, which are non-myelinated. It is very likely that apoE is taken up via a high affinity receptor, either the LDL receptor or LRP. While the distribution of these two receptors in the retina is not known, it is known that in the brain, the LRP is present on neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and proximal axons(11.Rebeck G. Reiter J. Strickland D. Hyman B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). LDL receptors are found on astrocytes, but not on neurons(11.Rebeck G. Reiter J. Strickland D. Hyman B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). We are now determining the distribution of the LRP and LDL receptor in the retina. We have also attempted to obtain direct evidence for receptor-mediated uptake of apoE into retinal ganglion cells by the injection of radiolabeled apoE into the vitreous with and without excess unlabeled apoE. These experiments have been unsuccessful, probably because of the large quantity of endogenous apoE in the vitreous. Whichever site(s) of uptake are utilized, the vesicular transport pathway utilized by apoE (and potentially by its receptor) appears likely to be one of two types that are not mutually exclusive. One is a transcytotic pathway involving internalization into endosomal vesicles in either dendrites and/or the cell soma and transfer to axonally bound transport vesicles. This pathway is analogous to the basolateral-to-apical transcytosis pathway utilized by epithelial cells (28.Simons K. Zerial M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 789-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). There is recent evidence, utilizing the transfected IgA receptor, for the existence of a dendritic/cell body-to-axonal transcytotic pathway in cultured neurons(29.Ikonen E. Parton R. Hunziker W. Simons K. Dotti C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 56-69Google Scholar). Also very recently, evidence for APP transcytosis has been obtained in cultured hippocampal neurons (30.Yamazaki T. Selkoe D.J. Koo E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The delayed appearance of radioactive apoE in peak 3 of the sucrose density gradient-separated transport vesicles may be explained by the existence of such a transcytotic pathway. However, it also could be explained by the delayed export of peptide-containing secretory vesicle precursors that has been previously described in this system(19.Morin P.J. Liu N. Johnson R.J. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21.Morin P.J. Johnson R. Shachar I. Fine R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 632: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). It is possible that all apoE molecules are taken up into the proximal axons and some are immediately transported in a forward direction, while the other portion is taken back to the Golgi apparatus and sorted into a peptide granule. Another pathway would involve direct uptake of apoE into the proximal axon and anterograde transport toward the axon terminal. This is likely to be the pathway utilized by the plasma membrane-targeted transport vesicle found in peak 2 of these gradients. This pathway is very rapid as opposed to the peak 3 pathway, with detectable apoE in the LGN by 3 h after labeling. To our knowledge, there is no evidence at present for the existence of such a pathway in neurons. However, there are apoE receptors localized on the proximal axons in the brain(11.Rebeck G. Reiter J. Strickland D. Hyman B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Finally, apoE in either peak 2- or 3-containing transport vesicles could result from the synthesis of apoE in the RGCs, followed by packaging into secretory vesicles with different densities and kinetic behavior. We have recently found that newly synthesized APP is rapidly transported in two discrete classes of secretory vesicle as well (15.Amaratunga A. Fine R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17268-17272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the pathway involved, what would be the function of such a pathway? One possibility would be the use of apoE as a lipid carrier to supply the axon's needs for particular lipids. Consistent with this possibility, we have recently found that a high percentage of newly synthesized apoE is associated with lipids in the medium of cultured Müller cells as well as in the vitreous. ( 2J. Shanmugaratnam, A. Amaratunga, and R. E. Fine, unpublished data.) There is recent evidence that while axons and nerve terminals in particular can resynthesize phospholipids, they cannot synthesize cholesterol and glycolipids and therefore depend on transport from the cell body to supply these essential molecules(31.Vance J. Pan D. Campenot R. Bussiere M. Vance D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), analogous to the situation with regard to proteins(32.Ochs S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1975; 253: 459-475Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There is evidence that apoE produced by astrocytes donates lipids and cholesterol to central nervous system neurons engaged in extensive axon growth and synaptic remodeling following lesioning (reviewed in (6.Poirier J. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 525-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar)). Also, it was very recently reported that homozygous apoE-deficient mice display a significant loss of synapses and disruption of the dendritic cytoskeleton with age as well as decreased hippocampal compensatory synaptogenesis after lesioning of the projections from the entorhinal cortex(33.Masliah E. Mallory M. Alford M. Ge N. Mucke L. Iqbal K. Mortimer J.A. Winblad B. Wisniewski H. Research Advances in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders. Wiley-Interscience, New York1995: 405-415Google Scholar). These changes would be consistent with long-term damage to these cells caused by a deficit in apoE-supplied lipid moieties, although other explanations cannot be ruled out. Our finding that apoE is rapidly transported in the axon of a long projection neuron, the neuronal class that is selectively vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease, may offer some insight into why the E4 isoform is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease(16.Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D. Pericak-Vance M. Enghild J. Salvesen G. Roses A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1977-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar, 34.Poirier J. Davignon J. Bouthillier D. Kogan S. Bartrand P. Gauthier S. Lancet. 1993; 342: 697-699Abstract PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). If the E4 form of apoE is unable to supply lipid to neurons as well as the other two isoforms of apoE, as a recent experiment with cell-cultured dorsal root ganglia indicates(35.Nathan B.P. Bellosta S. Sonan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), people with the E4 isoform may be more susceptible to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Other evidence supporting this conjecture has recently been reviewed(6.Poirier J. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 525-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Our apoE data combined with our results demonstrating APP transport (14.Morin P.J. Abraham C.R. Amaratunga A. Johnson R.J. Huber G. Sandell J.H. Fine R.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15.Amaratunga A. Fine R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17268-17272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) also suggest the possibility that apoE and APP could directly interact and be transported together in both Müller glia and RGCs. Since apoE4 and apoE3 appear to interact differently in vitro with the β-amyloid portion of APP(15.Amaratunga A. Fine R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17268-17272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is possible that they together perform some as yet unknown function in the central nervous system. In this regard, it has recently been demonstrated that the LRP can internalize and mediate degradation of APP as well as apoE in the context of a lipoprotein particle, suggesting internalization of both molecules into the same compartment(36.Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar).

This result provides the first direct evidence that c-Src is highly activated in platelets. Src family tyrosine kinases are widely distributed nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that have a role in many different signal transduction pathways downstream from various types of receptor in the cell membrane; however, their exact roles in signal transduction remain unknown. Src family tyrosine kinases (for reviews, see Hunter(1987), Cantley et al.(1991), and Bolen et al.(1992)) are known both from retroviruses that have the ability to transform cells (Src, Yes, Fgr, and Lck) and from mammalian genomes by the use of DNA probes for src/yes/fgr (Fyn, Lyn, Hck, Blk, and Yrk). A comparison of the corresponding cDNA sequences revealed that each member of this family has a very different sequence in the N-terminal region (50-80 amino acids from the N terminus). This region is thought to participate in specific cellular function through binding to different types of signal transducer (Resh, 1989; Shaw et al., 1990; Timson-Gauen et al., 1992), although the mechanism of regulation remains unknown. By contrast, the rest of the sequence is highly conserved, consisting sequentially of an Src homology (SH) ( 1The abbreviations used are: SHSrc homologymAbmonoclonal antibodyTBSTris-buffered salinePBSphosphate-buffered salineRIPAradioimmunoprecipitation buffer.) 3 domain, an SH2 domain, a kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (for reviews, see Margolis(1992), Pawson and Gish(1992), Cooper and Howell(1993), and Erpel and Courtneidge(1995)). Src homology monoclonal antibody Tris-buffered saline phosphate-buffered saline radioimmunoprecipitation buffer. Two tyrosine residues, Tyr-419 and Tyr-530 in human c-Src (corresponding to Tyr-416 and Tyr-527, respectively, in avian c-Src), can be phosphorylated, and their phosphorylation state influences the tyrosine kinase activity. Whereas the phosphorylation of Tyr-419 leads to a dramatic increase in kinase activity (Piwnica-Worms et al., 1987), the phosphorylation of Tyr-530 negatively regulates the kinase activity (Cooper et al., 1986). The csk gene product is responsible for the phosphorylation of Tyr-530 (Okada and Nakagawa, 1989; Okada et al., 1991). The mechanism of regulation involving these tyrosine residues is thought to be similar for other members of the Src family (Okada et al., 1991). On the basis of these observations, a model that involves intramolecular binding between Tyr-530 and the SH2 region was proposed (Roussel et al., 1991; Superti-Furga et al., 1993; Sieh et al., 1993). In this widely accepted model, subsequent signal transduction through direct binding to other proteins or by tyrosine phosphorylation is assumed to be prevented by this intramolecular binding. Consequently, the C-terminal region is important not only in the regulation of tyrosine kinase activity, but also in the association with SH2-containing proteins. In the present study, we have generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the C-terminal regulatory domain of c-Src. This mAb selectively recognized the active form of c-Src as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation. Several different types of experiment described here illustrated the usefulness of this mAb. The antibody had a different range of reactivity in comparison with mAb 327, which has been widely used for the detection of c-Src and v-Src. In particular, clone 28 was shown to have high sensitivity to the active form of c-Src in normal cells and tissues. A peptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of human c-Src (LEDYFTSTEPQYQPGENL, residues 519-536) was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem) with the bifunctional coupling reagent sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (Pierce). This conjugate was used for mouse immunization as described by Harlow and Lane(1988). The hybridomas obtained were screened by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a synthetic peptide as the antigen, and by Western blotting or immunoprecipitation using human cell line lysates. Freshly collected human blood was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min in the presence of sodium citrate as an anticoagulant. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The platelets, enriched in the pellet, were disrupted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS(-)) containing 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 mM NaF, 2 mM orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.25 mM (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride) in a Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was used for further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by means of the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nylon membrane (Millipore, polyvinylidene difluoride, IPVH 000-10) by means of a semidry blotting system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at a constant current of 0.8 mA/cm2. Blocking was performed for 1 h in a Tris-buffered solution containing 2% (w/v) skim milk (Difco). After incubation with either clone 28 or mAb 327 (Lipsich et al., 1983; Oncogene Science Inc., OP-07L), then with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Amersham Corp.), and the stain was developed with the Konica immunostain kit using 4-chloronaphthol as the substrate. For in vitro phosphorylation, human platelets were disrupted with RIPA buffer without SDS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM orthovanadate, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.25 mM (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride) and treated with mAbs. In each experiment, we confirmed by titration that the amount of antibody used was sufficient to precipitate all of the available protein. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Zymed) or anti-mouse IgG-agarose (American Corlex). After washing the precipitate three times with RIPA buffer without SDS, then twice with phosphorylation buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM MnCl2), we added [γ-32P]ATP (37 kBq (1 μCi); Amersham PB170) to the immune complex. For in vivo phosphorylation, human platelets were metabolically labeled with [32P]PO43- (3.7 MBq (0.1 mCi)/ml; Amersham PBS11) for 2 h. Immunoprecipitation was done by the same procedure used for in vitro phosphorylation, except that the RIPA buffer used for washing contained 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Peptide competition and preabsorption experiments were performed in these systems. Phosphorylated 60-kDa bands were excised from the dried gels and rehydrated with a solution containing 125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 1 mM EDTA. The bands were partially digested with V8 protease in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described by Cleveland et al.(1977). Cyanogen bromide mapping was performed according to Pepinsky(1983). For two-dimensional tryptic mapping, V1 and V2 bands were excised from gels and rehydrated with several changes of 20% (v/v) isopropanol and then 100% methanol. After complete drying, gel bands were digested with trypsin treated with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (50 μg/ml in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5) at 37°C overnight. Clarified supernatants of these digests were dried down in a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant) and washed with water by three cycles of suspension and vacuum drying. Finally, samples were resuspended in 10 μl of electrophoresis solvent (acetic acid:formic acid:H2O = 15:5:80) and spotted on TLC plates (silica gel 60; Merck). Tryptic peptides were first subjected to electrophoresis in the above solvent, then to chromatography in the second dimension in a different solvent (n-butanol:pyridine:acetic acid:H2O = 65:50:10:40). Phosphopeptide maps were visualized by means of a Fujix BAS2000 Bio-Image Analyzer (Itohara et al., 1993). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described by Sakai et al.(1995), with a slight modification. Briefly, rat normal (immortalized) cell line 3Y1 was fixed in 3.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mM sodium orthovanadate for 20 min at 4°C and washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Cells were then permeabilized by treatment with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in TBS containing 2 mM sodium orthovanadate for 15 min at 4°C. They were washed with TBS containing 0.5 mM sodium orthovanadate and incubated in TBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 30 min to block nonspcific protein binding. Slides were then incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies for 60 min at room temperature (normal mouse IgG was used as a negative control antibody). The slides were washed with TBS containing 0.5 mM sodium orthovanadate and were treated with fluorescein-labeled, affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) for 40 min at room temperature. Slides were briefly washed with TBS, mounted with glass coverslips, and viewed with a BX60 fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Immunocytochemical observations were performed as described by Sakai et al.(1993) with a slight modification. Deparaffinized sections were immersed in methanol containing 0.3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide to inactivate endogenous peroxidases. After washing with PBS(-), the sections were incubated in PBS containing 5% (v/v) normal goat serum to block nonspecific protein binding, then pretreated with a biotin/avidin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.) to block avidin binding to endogenous biotin. They were then treated with antibodies and left overnight at 4°C (normal mouse IgG was used as a negative control primary antibody). The sections were treated with a secondary antibody, biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Organon Teknika), and then with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Histofine, Nichirei Corp.). The color was developed with a freshly prepared chromogen solution containing 0.1% (w/v) 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Dojindo Laboratories) and 0.02% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted with glass coverslips, and observed under a New Vanox-s microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd.). Of five hybridomas screened by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system with the peptide that was used for immunization (LEDYFTSTPQYQPGENL, amino acids 519-536 in human c-Src), one clone, termed clone 28, was sensitive enough to detect a 60-kDa band in a human platelet lysate by Western blotting (Fig. 1A, lane 2). By combined immunoprecipitation/Western blotting, this 60-kDa protein was recognized by mAb 327 (Fig. 1B, lane 2), whose epitope is thought to be in the SH3 domain of v-Src and c-Src. The 60-kDa protein in the immunoprecipitate of clone 28 was still recognized by clone 28 in the above system, demonstrating that clone 28 retains its specificity even when the c-Src protein is denatured (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Clone 28 immunoprecipitated phosphorylated 60-kDa protein from lysates of human platelets metabolically labeled with [32P]PO43- (Fig. 2A). The detection sensitivity of clone 28 was comparable to that of mAb 327 as determined by titration of each antibody. In contrast to this in vivo phosphorylation, only the clone 28 precipitate displayed strong in vitro phosphorylation. A human platelet lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation by either clone 28 or mAb 327. After a thorough wash with RIPA buffer without SDS, and then with phosphorylation buffer, [γ-32P]ATP was added for in vitro phosphorylation. The fluorograph obtained (Fig. 2B) showed that the clone 28 precipitate was heavily phosphorylated compared with the mAb 327 precipitate. As determined by titration of the antibody concentration, the clone 28 precipitate underwent 50 times as much autophosphorylation as did the mAb 327 precipitate. Taken together, these results show clone 28 to be a sensitive and selective detector of the activated form of c-Src (Tyr-530 not phosphorylated). Augmentation of the kinase activity was confirmed by mixing clone 28 and purified c-Src in the in vitro phosphorylation system (data not shown). In order to define the site within the C-terminal region of c-Src to which clone 28 binds, we synthesized a series of peptides corresponding to segments of the peptide used for immunization (Table 1). The in vitro phosphorylation assay was used to detect competition by each peptide for clone 28 (Fig. 3A). Antigen recognition was completely inhibited by the peptides QYQPGENL (amino acids 529-536), QFQPGENL (amino acids 529-536, Tyr 530 replaced by Phe) and QYQPGDQT (amino acids 529-536, ENL replaced by DQT, identical to the corresponding region in c-Fgr), and partially inhibited by EPQYQPG (amino acids 527-533), all at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. The N-terminal eight amino acids of the peptide used for immunization, LEDYFTST (amino acids 519-526), did not influence antigen recognition. We therefore concluded that clone 28 bound to the C-terminal region of c-Src in the vicinity of Tyr-530. For further confirmation of the specificity of this clone, we used the peptide QYQPGENL in either the nonphosphorylated or the phosphorylated form for in vitro phosphorylation. Whereas the nonphosphorylated peptide completely inhibited antigen recognition even at the lowest concentration used (1 μg/ml; Fig. 3B, lanes 2-4), the phosphorylated peptide only partially inhibited the phosphorylation (27% at 1 μg/ml and 88% at 10 μg/ml; Fig. 3B, lanes 5-7). Thus we could localize the epitope to the center of critical C-terminal regulatory domain.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab For the further analysis of the phosphorylation state of c-Src recognized by clone 28 or mAb 327, each 60-kDa band was excised from the gel shown in Fig. 2A and subjected to partial digestion by V8 protease (Fig. 4A). The phosphorylation of both the V1 fragment (which contains phosphorylated Ser-12, Ser-17, Thr-34, and Thr-46 in c-Src; Courtneidge and Smith(1984)) and the V2 fragment (which contains phosphorylated Tyr-419 and Tyr-530 in c-Src) was observed in both precipitates by this mapping procedure. Cyanogen bromide cleavage confirmed this result and also showed that Tyr-530 was phosphorylated only in the mAb 327 precipitate (Fig. 4B). Tryptic maps of V2 fragments derived from clone 28 and mAb 327 precipitates also confirmed this result; additional spots not seen in the clone 28 precipitate were detected in the mAb 327 precipitate (Fig. 4C, c and d), whereas tryptic maps of V1 fragments from both precipitates displayed almost identical patterns (Fig. 4C, a and b). We also performed preabsorption experiments in in vitro and in vivo systems. Lysates of human platelets metabolically labeled with [32P]PO43- were pretreated with normal mouse IgG or clone 28, then subjected to clone 28 and mAb 327 precipitation (Fig. 5A). Lanes 1 and 2 show the basal level of clone 28 and mAb 327 binding activity toward the phosphorylated 60-kDa form when normal mouse IgG was used in preabsorption step. Even when excess clone 28 was used in the preabsorption step, substantial phosphorylated 60-kDa bands remained that were recognized by mAb 327 (lane 3). This result suggested that substantial amounts of c-Src were phosphorylated at Tyr-530 in human platelets. (If a significant amount of the observed phosphorylation were due to Ser or Thr, we would have expected a reduction in the intensity of the 60-kDa band (see Fig. 4A).) In addition, we pretreated cold platelet lysates with normal mouse IgG or clone 28 and then subjected them to clone 28 and mAb 327 precipitation (Fig. 5B). Under conditions when both clone 28 and mAb 327 showed high autophosphorylation activity (lanes 1 and 2), substantial kinase activity was observed in the mAb 327 precipitate even when excess clone 28 was used in the preabsorption step (lane 3). We examined the cellular distribution of the active form of c-Src tyrosine kinase in normal rat 3Y1 cells. In addition to the expected submembranous localization, we also observed intense staining on the outer nuclear membrane and the cytoskeletal components (Fig. 6A). In contrast to clone 28, the staining with mAb 327 was too weak to show any distinct localization within the cell (Fig. 6B). In order to test the utility of the clone 28 directly in an in vivo system, we examined formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded C3H-mouse fetal liver (16 days) by an immunocytochemical method. Fig. 7 clearly shows the presence of the active form of c-Src in megakaryocytes, but completely negative immunoreactivity in hepatocytes, reticulocytes, and granulocytes in the fetal liver. We also detected high level of the active form in neuronal tissues. ( 2T. Sakai and H. Kawakatsu, unpublished observation.) In order to clarify the activation mechanism of Src family tyrosine kinases, we set out to produce mAbs that could be used to distinguish the active and inactive forms of these tyrosine kinases in various systems. Activation is associated with dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residue nearest the C terminus (Courtneidge, 1985; Cooper and King, 1986), and subsequent signal transfer is presumed to involve a dissociation between this tyrosine-containing region and an SH2 region. We have generated a single mAb, termed clone 28, that could selectively recognize the active form of c-Src. We have characterized clone 28 and demonstrated its usefulness as follows: 1) clone 28 sensitively detected the active form of c-Src as judged by titration in an in vitro phosphorylation experiment (Fig. 2); 2) a competition study using phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated synthetic peptides confirmed the specificity of clone 28 for the active (Tyr-530 nonphosphorylated) form (Fig. 3); 3) the phosphorylation site of the clone 28 precipitate was clearly distinguishable from that of the mAb 327 precipitate (Fig. 4); 4) preabsorption experiments with clone 28 and mAb 327 in in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation systems suggested that there are at least two different conformations that retain kinase activity (Fig. 5); and 5) the distribution of the active form in rodent tissues and cultured cells could be directly observed by an immunocytochemical method (Fig. 6 and 7). Cooper and Howell(1993) proposed a new activation mechanism for Src family tyrosine kinases involving allosteric activators or inhibitors. They presumed that phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues might be a consequence, and not a cause, of changes in activity. Site-directed mutagenesis studies (Hirai and Varmus, 1990; O'Brien et al., 1990; Seidel-Dugan et al., 1992) support this notion, because Src could be activated by introducing mutations in other domains such as SH2 or SH3. The detection of kinase activity both before and after preabsorption by clone 28 (Fig. 5) also showed good agreement with this previous work, since excess clone 28 could not completely immunoprecipitate the active form, even though this clone was specific for the active form. Erpel and Courtneidge(1995) also discussed yet another activation mechanism and proposed three possible pathways to the active form. In platelets, V8 phosphopeptide mapping facilitated further analysis of the phosphorylation state of the clone 28 and the mAb 327 precipitates: the patterns for both precipitates were virtually identical (Fig. 4A). Cichowski et al.(1992) detected Src, Yes, and Fyn, but not Fgr, in thrombin-stimulated human platelets. They co-precipitated Yes and Fyn with an antibody against GTP-activating protein, but the member of the Src family responsible for platelet activation has not been identified. We also investigated several antibodies against each member of the c-Src family in order to identify which were active in the platelet system, but none of the antibodies demonstrated satisfactory sensitivity or specificity. However, clone 28 could give us valuable information on alterations in the kinase activity and cellular localization of Src family tyrosine kinases; such information could help us understand the redundancy and compensation in vivo among the members of the Src family that possess the QYQPG motif. Primary cells derived from knockout mice (e.g. src, fyn, and yes) might provide information about the role of each member of the Src family when tested with our new antibody. Polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal region of c-Src have previously been reported (Courtneidge and Smith, 1984; Cooper and King, 1986). One of these antibodies (Courtneidge and Smith, 1984) could be used both for the precipitation of the phosphorylated form of the kinase and for the autophosphorylation assay. However, there was no mention of cross-reactivity among members of the Src family. Another antibody (Cooper and King, 1986) stimulated the kinase activity upon antibody binding and could also be used for the precipitation of the phosphorylated form. For these polyclonal antibodies, it is possible that several epitopes coexist, some containing Tyr-530 and some not. The results obtained with these antibodies are consistent with our results. Since clone 28 recognized only a single epitope (adjacent to Tyr-530) and was specific for the nonphosphorylated, active form, the phosphorylation state of c-Src was more readily characterized with this antibody. In addition to its usefulness in biochemical systems, we have also demonstrated the application of clone 28 in in vivo systems. In particular, Fig. 7 clearly shows a restricted distribution of the active form in megakaryocytes, the progenitors of platelets. The tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src might be essential for platelet formation in the fetal liver, because c-Src was activated at all the developmental stages we observed (data not shown). Our data show good agreement with previous work, which reported high kinase activity in platelets by an in vitro kinase assay (Oda et al., 1992; Horvath et al., 1992; Clark and Brugge, 1993). In contrast to the intense staining in established cell lines such as 3Y1 (Fig. 6), immunohistochemical observations with mouse tissue sections revealed a restricted distribution even in the fetal stage, where cellular growth and differentiation actively occur (Fig. 7). These data, taken together, suggest that c-Src kinase activity would be suppressed in the steady state and activated transiently by extracellular stimuli in major tissues. With clone 28, our immunofluorescence studies demonstrated distinctive staining of c-Src in normal rat cells, whereas with mAb 327, only a weak, diffuse staining pattern was observed. With mAb 327, it is very difficult to detect c-Src unless the protein is overexpressed by gene transfection (David-Pfeuty and Nouvian-Dooghe, 1990; David-Pfeuty et al., 1993; Kaplan et al., 1994). Our new mAb could provide valuable information about early events in carcinogenesis and other diseases in which Src family tyrosine kinases or associated SH2-containing proteins play a crucial role.

RecA filaments possess an intrinsic capacity for DNA strand exchange, mediated by binding energy rather than ATP hydrolysis, that is augmented by an ATP-dependent molecular motor. The RecA protein of Escherichia coli promotes a DNA strand exchange reaction that mimics key steps in recombinational DNA repair and homologous recombination. A RecA nucleoprotein filament forms on a single-stranded DNA circle. The bound single strand is aligned with a homologous linear duplex DNA, and strand exchange leads to the formation of a hybrid circular duplex DNA with a nick in one strand (Cox, 1993, 1994; Kowalczykowski and Eggleston, 1994; Roca and Cox, 1990; West, 1992). The RecA nucleoprotein filament exhibits an ATPase activity with a monomer kcat of about 30 min-1 when bound to ssDNA ( 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAbpbase pair(s)ATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphateSSBthe single-stranded DNA binding protein of E. coli.) (Cox, 1994). The RecA protein is found in essentially all bacteria (Roca and Cox, 1990). The paradigm extends to eukaryotes, with the RAD51 protein of yeast now proving to be a true RecA homologue in both structure and function (Ogawa et al., 1993; Sung, 1994). single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA base pair(s) adenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate the single-stranded DNA binding protein of E. coli. NTPases find cellular employment as motors, timing devices, or recycling functions (Alberts and Miake-Lye, 1992). The ATPase activity of RecA protein has come to be viewed largely as a recycling function, involved primarily in the disassembly of the RecA filament or the recycling of monomers within a filament (Menetski et al., 1990; Alberts and Miake-Lye, 1992; West, 1992; Rehrauer and Kowalczykowski, 1993; Kowalczykowski and Eggleston, 1994; Kowalczykowski and Krupp, 1995). RecA nucleoprotein filaments have an intrinsic capacity to promote DNA strand exchange without hydrolyzing ATP, as shown by the limited DNA strand exchange reactions observed with ATPγS (Menetski et al., 1990), with a RecA mutant protein which binds but does not hydrolyze ATP (RecA K72R) (Rehrauer and Kowalczykowski, 1993), and in the presence of ADP-AlF-4 (Kowalczykowski and Krupp, 1995). The recycling function is readily demonstrable, but provides an incomplete explanation for the RecA ATPase activity. Reported filament disassembly reactions are filament end-dependent and rarely account for more than a minute fraction of the ATP hydrolyzed in a RecA nucleoprotein filament (Lindsley and Cox, 1989, 1990a). When homologous duplex DNA is added to RecA nucleoprotein filaments to initiate strand exchange, the monomer kcat for ATP hydrolysis drops abruptly to about 20 min-1, and then is invariant during the subsequent strand exchange reaction (Schutte and Cox, 1987). This ATP hydrolysis has not been accounted for by any model which assigns the primary role of the ATPase to dissociation of RecA monomers. A more complete view arises from a closer examination of the limitations RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange reaction in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis alters the DNA strand exchange reaction fundamentally, conferring properties important to the function of RecA protein in recombinational DNA repair (Clark and Sandler, 1994; Cox, 1993, 1994). When RecA hydrolyzes ATP, the DNA strand exchange reaction becomes unidirectional (Jain et al., 1994; Shan et al., 1996), generates longer hybrid DNA products much more efficiently (Jain et al., 1994), bypasses a range of structural barriers in either DNA substrate (Rosselli and Stasiak, 1991; Kim et al., 1992a; Shan et al., 1996), and accommodates 4 DNA strands (Kim et al., 1992b; Shan et al., 1996). We have suggested that the undirected DNA strand exchange occurring in the absence of ATP hydrolysis constitutes a distinct phase of the normal reaction (Shan et al., 1996). The resulting nascent hybrid DNA, typically 1-2 kilobase pairs in length, is extended in a subsequent reaction phase that is greatly facilitated by ATP hydrolysis. If the two processes are coupled, the rates of hybrid DNA extension and ATP hydrolysis during strand exchange should be correlated in predictable ways. In particular, the two processes should exhibit a similar dependence on temperature. The effects of temperature have provided evidence for the coupling of NTP hydrolysis to a number of motor functions. An interesting example was reported by Koshland and co-workers, who used coincident Arrhenius plots to relate the myosin ATPase activity to the walking rate of ants (Levy et al., 1959). To date, there has been no systematic attempt to measure the rate of DNA strand exchange with different substrates or examine the temperature dependence of RecA reactions. The existing data set is probably insufficient even to establish rigorously that there is an intrinsic and characteristic rate of branch movement during DNA strand exchange that can be associated with ATP hydrolysis. In this report, we develop an improved method for estimating the rate of branch movement during DNA strand exchange and use it to establish a closer experimental correlation between RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange and ATP hydrolysis. E. coli RecA protein was purified to homogeneity and stored as described previously (Cox et al., 1981). E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) was purified as described by Lohman et al.(1986), except that an additional step utilizing DEAE-Sepharose chromatography was included to ensure removal of single-stranded exonucleases. The RecA protein and SSB concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients ofє280 = 0.59 A280 mg-1 ml (Craig and Roberts, 1981), and є280 = 1.5 A280 mg-1 ml (Lohman and Overman, 1985), respectively. Restriction endonucleases and β-agarase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Tris buffer was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. DEAE-Sepharose was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate, lactic dehydrogenase, ATP, creatine phosphokinase, phosphocreatine, proteinase K, and low melting agarose were purchased from Sigma. Thin layer polyethyleneimine cellulose chromatography sheets were purchased from Brinkmann. The concentration of ATP was determined by absorbance at 259 nm, using the extinction coefficient є259 = 1.54 × 104M-1 cm-1. The purity of the ATP was assessed by thin layer chromatography and was shown to be at least 99% pure, with the major contaminant being ADP. ATP labeled at position 2 with 3H (24 Ci mmol-1) was purchased from Amersham Corp. (Amersham TRK.336). Circular single-stranded and supercoiled circular duplex DNAs from bacteriophage M13mp8.1037 (8,266 bp) were prepared using methods described previously (Davis et al., 1980; Messing, 1983; Neuendorf and Cox, 1986). The bacteriophage M13mp8.1037 is the bacteriophage M13mp8 with a 1037-bp sequence (EcoRV fragment) from the E. coli gal T gene inserted into the SmaI site (Lindsley and Cox, 1990b). The concentrations of ssDNA and dsDNA stock solutions were determined by absorbance at 260 nm, using 36 and 50 mg ml-1A260-1, respectively as conversion factors. DNA concentrations are reported in terms of total nucleotides. Full-length linear duplex DNA was derived from M13mp8.1037 supercoiled closed-circular form of plasmid or bacteriophage DNA as isolated from E. coli cells by complete digestion with AlwNI endonuclease, using conditions suggested by the enzyme supplier. Endonucleolytic digestion of M13mp8.1037 with both AlwNI and AvaII yielded DNA fragments of 4539 and 3727 bp, while digestion with AlwNI, AvaII, and BglII generated DNA fragments of 2058, 2481, and 3727 bp. Finally, when the four endonucleases AlwNI, AvaII, BglII, and PacI were used to digest M13mp8.1037, the four DNA fragments produced were 1782, 1945, 2058, and 2481 bp in length. For use in experiments where multiple dsDNA fragments were used in a single reaction, the DNA fragments in the restriction digest were not gel-purified but simply extracted 1:1 with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), followed by ethanol precipitation. In reactions where individual dsDNA fragments were used, the dsDNA fragments were isolated from low-melting agarose gels using β-agarase according to the manufacturer's directions. The fragments were then extracted 1:1 with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), followed by ethanol precipitation. The formation of nicked circular heteroduplex product of strand exchange was monitored by the agarose gel electrophoresis assay of Cox and Lehman(1981). Reactions were carried out 37°C or at the indicated temperature in a standard reaction buffer containing 25 mM Tris acetate (80% cation, pH 7.5), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 3 mM potassium glutamate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and an ATP regeneration system (10 units ml-1 creatine phosphokinase, 12 mM phosphocreatine). Reactions were carried out in a Brinkmann Instruments Lauda K-2/RD refrigerated water bath to ensure constant temperature. Reaction volumes ranged from 40 to 300 μl, and the concentrations of DNA and proteins reported below are the final concentrations after addition of all components. Duplex DNA (15 μM in terms of total nucleotides) and ssDNA (5 μM) were preincubated with 2.5 μM RecA protein for 10 min before ATP (3 mM) and SSB protein (0.5 μM) were added to start the reaction. Aliquots (15 μl) of reactions were withdrawn at various times, mixed with 10 μl of gel loading buffer (0.125% bromphenol blue, 0.125% xylene cyanol FF, 15% glycerol, and 5% SDS), and subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel in Tris acetate-EDTA buffer at 2-2.5 V cm-1. The agarose gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed with UV light. The intensities of DNA bands were quantified by scanning the photographic negatives using an Apple One Scanner and analyzing the scanned image with NIH Image 1.44 software. In reactions involving multiple dsDNA fragments, the total dsDNA concentration was kept constant at 15 μM in each reaction. In reactions where individual shorter dsDNA fragments were used, the dsDNA concentration was varied downward so that the ratio of duplex DNA molecules to ssDNA molecules remained constant. Visualization of reactions by electron microscopy was carried out by spreading the entire strand exchange reaction mixture after deproteinization and dialysis. Aliquots of strand exchange reactions were removed at early time points during the reaction (9 or 11 min). These samples were incubated with Proteinase K (0.5 mg ml-1 final) and SDS (0.5% final) at 37°C for 30 min to remove the RecA and SSB proteins. The samples were then dialyzed into 20 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA for 4 h at 25°C before spreading as described previously (Inman and Schnös, 1970). The coupled spectrophotometric assay used to measure ATP hydrolysis was described previously (Iype et al., 1994; Morrical et al., 1986). The regeneration of ATP from ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate coupled to the oxidation of NADH can be followed by the decrease in absorbance at 380 nm. An NADH extinction coefficient of є380 = 1.21 mM-1 cm-1 was used to calculate the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The reaction conditions during the ATPase assay were identical to DNA strand exchange conditions, except that pyruvate kinase (5 units/ml) and phosphoenolpyruvate (2.3 mM) were used as the ATP regeneration system; NADH (3 mM) and lactic dehydrogenase (4.5 units/ml) were also included. These modifications had no effect on the rate of DNA strand exchange at temperatures above 33°C; however, they did result in a decrease in the rate of strand exchange at lower temperatures. An alternative ATPase assay was employed at these lower temperatures as described below. Absorbance measurements were obtained in a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 7 double-beam recording spectrophotometer equipped with two six-position thermojacketed cuvette holders attached to a Brinkmann Instruments Lauda K-2/RD refrigerated water bath and circulator. ATP hydrolysis during DNA strand exchange was measured as described previously (Schutte and Cox, 1987). Control experiments varying the amount of the pyruvate kinase and lactic dehydrogenase at different temperatures showed that the activity of these enzymes did not limit the overall rate of ATP hydrolysis within the temperature ranges employed in these experiments. To measure ATP hydrolysis at temperatures below 33°C, a TLC assay was employed (Kornberg et al., 1978). TLC plates were washed by elution with water and dried before use. A mixture of nonradioactive ATP and ADP (1 μl of 16 mM ATP and 16 mM ADP) was spotted at the origin of each lane on the plates and dried (these were carriers that permitted the ready detection of the ATP and ADP spots in the developed plates). Strand exchange reactions were carried out as described above except that the ATP regeneration system was omitted, and [3H]ATP was added (4 mCi in a 50-ml reaction). For some of the lower temperatures (below 30°C), the DNA and protein concentrations were doubled to increase the observed signal. This modification had no effect on the observed kcat for RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis, nor on the rate of DNA strand exchange (data not shown). Aliquots (1.5 μl) of reactions at various time points were then spotted on the prepared TLC plates. After drying, the plates were developed in 1 M formic acid, 0.5 M LiCl. The positions of the ADP and the ATP spots were determined by their UV fluorescence. The spots were excised and the radioactivity in each quantified by scintillation counting. The purpose of this study was to examine the rate of DNA strand exchange in more detail, examining correlations that should exist if DNA strand exchange is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. This requires accurate methods with which to monitor the rate of both ATP hydrolysis and branch movement during DNA strand exchange. Whereas accurate methods are available to monitor rates of ATP hydrolysis, obtaining a reliable estimate of the rate of branch movement in DNA strand exchange is problematic. Published estimates, which vary over at least a 5-fold range, were obtained from average rates of hybrid DNA formation in a large population of molecules that initiate the reaction asynchronously (Roca and Cox, 1990). Once initiated, secondary interactions with additional DNA molecules in solution might interfere with branch movement in some complexes (coaggregation) (Tsang et al., 1985), exaggerating the apparent asynchrony. We dealt with these uncertainties by focusing only on the formation of the circular duplex DNA product (Fig. 1A). In a reaction involving our 8266-bp DNA substrates, this product first appears after a significant lag and thereafter accumulates until most of the substrate DNA has been converted (Fig. 1B). We quantified the bands in experiments such as that in Fig. 1B, and extrapolated to the time point when the first product appeared (Fig. 1C, arrow). The time required to generate the first product should provide the most reliable estimate of the intrinsic rate of branch movement in a reacting complex, reflecting an early initiation and a minimization of any subsequent inhibition from interactions with other DNA molecules. The apparent rate of DNA branch movement (in bp min-1) is defined as the length of the duplex DNA substrate divided by the lag (in minutes) before the first appearance of products. In practice, experiments with relatively few time points were used to roughly characterize the product generation curve, followed by a more detailed time course with time points concentrated near the anticipated lag time to define it as accurately as possible. The error in most lag measurements is about ±1 min. This translates into an error of about ±10% for a typical experiment (the error increases for shorter duplex substrates). Experiments were discarded when excessive scatter in the product generation curve precluded a reliable extrapolation. All of the strand exchange experiments used in this study generated products at levels greater than half of the predicted maximum of 67%. Two sets of correlations were pursued. In the first, we examined the effect of dividing the duplex DNA substrate into fragments and the capacity of a single RecA filament to carry out multiple strand exchange reactions concurrently. This is done in part to help establish that there is an intrinsic and constant rate of branch movement during DNA strand exchange. In the second, we compare the temperature dependencies of the DNA strand exchange reaction and ATP hydrolysis during strand exchange. ATP is hydrolyzed uniformly throughout a RecA nucleoprotein filament (Brenner et al., 1987). In postulating a separate phase of DNA strand exchange that is coupled to ATP hydrolysis, one assumption is that the rate of branch movement is constant and that all parts of a nucleoprotein filament are equally competent to promote branch movement. If the linear duplex DNA substrate is cleaved into two pieces of equal size, they should react concurrently and produce a fully duplex circular product in half the time required for the reaction shown in Fig. 1A. This assumes that both branches move unidirectionally at the same rate. Since ATP is hydrolyzed by each RecA monomer at the same rate regardless of whether it is near a branch (Brenner et al., 1987; Schutte and Cox, 1987), and we assume the rate of ATP hydrolysis has some relationship to the rate of branch movement, no change in the rate of ATP hydrolysis should be observed. Satisfying these conditions does not in itself provide evidence for the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to DNA strand exchange, but results not adhering to the predictions would provide evidence against coupling by some proposed mechanisms (Cox, 1994). Results inconsistent with these predictions would also cast doubt on the assumption that branch movement in strand exchange proceeds at a constant rate. The linear duplex substrate in these experiments, M13mp8.1037 (8266 bp), was cleaved to produce one, two, three, or four fragments as shown in Fig. 2. The cleaved substrates were then used in DNA strand exchange reactions with RecA nucleoprotein filaments bound to single-stranded M13 mp8.1037 circles. All reactions were done at 37°C. The results in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the appearance of fully duplex product circles is accelerated as the number of fragments increases. This experiment was carried out three times with similar results. Estimates for the rate of branch movement obtained as outlined in Fig. 1 are summarized in Table 1. The rates are fairly uniform, especially when it is assumed that the rate of product appearance is limited by the length of the longest DNA fragment present. The average rate of branch movement obtained by this method is 378 bp min-1.Figure 3:Assay for DNA strand exchange with multiple branch points.

To confirm this, some of the reactions were spread and examined by electron microscopy. The molecules shown in Fig. 4, involving two dsDNA fragments, were observed 11 min after the initiation of the reaction. In both cases, the ssDNA is participating in a strand exchange reaction with two fragments, and the strand exchange is progressing in the same direction with both fragments. Although a detailed characterization of the spreads was not undertaken, the results suggested a significant degree of asynchrony in the initiation of strand exchange by the two fragments on a given nucleoprotein filament, since only one-third to one-half of the intermediates observed were reacting with two duplex fragments. Samples were not cross-linked in these trials, and we do not know to what extent the results are affected by loss of DNA joints due to the spontaneous branch migration during sample preparation observed previously (Jain et al., 1994). Rates of ATP hydrolysis were also monitored during these experiments (Table 1). As observed previously (Schutte and Cox, 1987), addition of a homologous linear duplex resulted in a decrease in the rate of ATP hydrolysis of about 30%. This decrease is complete in about 2 min, and its extent is dependent on the length of available homology (with the 30% maximum observed when the homologous duplex substrate was as long as the ssDNA) (Schutte and Cox, 1987). A linear rate was observed during the 30-min span over which data was taken in the present experiments (between 5 and 35 min into the reaction). Rates observed during DNA strand exchange were not affected by dividing the duplex substrate into as many as four fragments (Table 1). The idea behind these experiments, to compare rates of DNA strand exchange and ATP hydrolysis at different temperatures, is simple. However, a number of complexities were encountered in their execution, some of them unexpected. A useful temperature range of 25 to 45°C was established empirically for this work. RecA protein activity increases with temperature up to at least 45°C. We avoided higher temperatures to minimize the chance of rate changes due to RecA inactivation. Below 25°C, RecA activities become too slow for accurate rate measurements. The rate of ATP hydrolysis reported is the invariant rate observed during strand exchange after the abrupt drop in monomer kcat that accompanies the initiation of the reaction. This drop was approximately 30% throughout the temperature range. Apparent rates of DNA branch movement are reported for the 8266 bp duplex substrate as in Fig. 1C. A series of control experiments were carried out to ensure that any changes observed reflected temperature-dependent changes in the kcat for ATP hydrolysis or the rate of branch movement, as opposed to changes in the amount of bound RecA or the Km for ATP. We established that the Km for ATP was below 300 μM throughout the temperature range. In RecA protein titrations carried out at five different temperatures spanning the chosen temperature range, the rate of ATP hydrolysis saturated in each case at a RecA concentration corresponding to 3 ± 0.5 nucleotides of DNA per RecA monomer. The final conditions and methods used to measure rates were affected by our unexpected discovery that ATP regeneration systems based on pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate inhibit both DNA strand exchange and ATP hydrolysis in a temperature-dependent fashion. Direct comparisons of DNA strand exchange reactions carried out with the pyruvate kinase ATP regenerating system and the alternative system based on creatine phosphokinase revealed a substantial inhibition of the strand exchange reaction by the former below 33°C, an effect that increased as the temperature was lowered to 25°C. A parallel inhibition of the ATPase activity was also observed when experiments using the spectrophotometric coupled assay (which includes pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate) were compared to initial rates of ATP hydrolysis measured with the alternative TLC assay (which contains no regenerating system). The basis of the inhibitory effect of the pyruvate kinase/phosphoenolpyruvate system at low temperatures was unclear. At 35°C and above, the two ATP regeneration systems gave comparable results in strand exchange reactions, and the two methods for monitoring ATP hydrolysis also gave identical results. We do not know which component of the pyruvate kinase/phosphoenolpyruvate system is responsible for the low temperature inhibition. The rates of ATP hydrolysis during strand exchange were monitored with the more accurate spectrophotometric assay above 35°C, and with the thin layer chromatographic assay at 33°C and below. Measurements with the latter assay reflect initial rates determined between 2 and 10 min after initiation of DNA strand exchange. Although the two assays for ATP hydrolysis were in good agreement in experiments done at the higher temperatures, the error in the TLC assay is inherently greater. We compensated by increasing the number of experiments done at the lower temperatures. All of the DNA strand exchange experiments were done in the presence of the creatine phosphokinase/phosphocreatine ATP regenerating system. A final factor that could affect the interpretation of the observed rates of DNA strand exchange is the possibility that exchange occurs in more than one kinetic phase. As described in the Introduction, a phase not requiring ATP hydrolysis may contribute a significant amount of hybrid DNA near the beginning of the reaction. If this phase is as rapid as some studies suggest (Menetski et al., 1990), it could result in a burst of hybrid DNA formation preceding the putative ATP hydrolysis-dependent process we are interested in measuring. This could, in turn, affect the outcome of the temperature dependence study, particularly if the size of the burst phase varied with temperature. To evaluate the effects of a possible rapid phase in strand exchange on our overall measurements, we carried out a series of strand exchange reactions with individual truncated linear duplex DNA substrates. If a significant rapid phase exists, the apparent rate of branch movement should increase with shorter DNA substrates, where the rapid phase would contribute a correspondingly larger fraction of the hybrid DNA product. Although shorter duplex substrates were employed in the experiment of Fig. 2, a rapid phase may have been obscured by any asynchrony in the reaction of the multiple DNA fragments. The results are shown in Fig. 5. An increase in the apparent rate of branch movement during DNA strand exchange is observed as the length of the duplex substrate decreases (Fig. 5B). If we assume that there is a rapid phase that contributes 1200 bp of hybrid DNA to the reaction, the apparent rate of branch movement for the remainder of each substrate becomes independent of length (Fig. 5C)."

We monitored the Ca2+i of both cells by two-dimensional fura-2 imaging, simultaneously measuring NO production as NO-2.

In contrast, the order in reference to both the extent of Ca2+i reduction in cocultured VSMCs and the elevation in NO production over the level of basal release in ECs completely matched and was ranked as thapsigargin > ionomycin > ATP > bradykinin.

The enzyme has been purified from the Gram-positive bacterium Brevibacterium fuscum and characterized. The enzyme appears to have a range of quaternary structures with predominant components of α4 and α6 (α subunit Mr = 42500 ± 1500) and binds ˷1 Fe(II)/subunit. Although the substrate Km values are similar to those of other Fe(II) ring cleaving dioxygenases, the turnover number is lower by 90-97%, and the enzyme exhibits much higher stability to metal chelators and H2O2. The stability to H2O2 is shown to derive from an endogenous catalase activity of 2,3-HPCD (stoichiometry: 2 H2O2→ 2 H2O + O2) that is novel for dioxygenases. H2O2 is a mixed-type inhibitor of the dioxygenase activity, suggesting that dioxygenase and catalase activities are both catalyzed by the enzyme, but at distinguishable sites. In contrast, catecholic substrates, including homoprotocatechuate and p-nitrocatechol, are nonessential activators of the catalase activity. The plot of 1/vi of catalase activity versus 1/[H2O2] is parabolic in the absence of catecholic substrates and linear in their presence, indicating that these reactions proceed by different mechanisms. A mechanism for catalase activity is proposed in which 2 H2O2 molecules bind simultaneously to the iron to account for the observed parabolic kinetic plot. Electron transfer between the peroxides mediated by the iron would yield 2 H2O and O2. Catecholic substrates are proposed to modify this reaction by excluding one H2O2 from the Fe(II), thereby causing the kinetic plots to appear linear. Electron donation by the catecholic substrates would facilitate O-O bond cleavage of H2O2, but outer sphere electron transfer from a second H2O2 in another step would be necessary to complete the reaction. p-Nitrocatechol is shown to bind differently to 2,3-HPCD than to other Fe(II) ring cleavage dioxygenases. Possible explanations for this observation are considered in the context of the proposed catalase and normal dioxygenase mechanisms which may also have bearing on the unique catalase activity and low dioxygenase turnover number of the enzyme."

Ionotropic (NMDA and kainate/AMPA) and, to a smaller extent, metabotropic glutamate receptors were both present in all the five AP cell types, defined by the hormone they store. Cells within all the types responded also to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Alternative typing by the response to four well-established hypothalamic releasing hormones (HRHs), GHRH, GnRH, CRH, and TRH, was performed. One-third of the cells were not sensitive to any HRH, another third were sensitive to only one HRH, and the last third were sensitive to more than one HRH, frequently to all four. Only the cells responding to TRH showed functional glutamate receptors. Superimposed to the above association, the strongest responses to glutamate were found in the cells responsive to multiple HRHs. These results suggest that glutamate may act, by a nonsynaptic mechanism, as a new releasing factor for one or, like TRH, several AP hormones. Coexpression of glutamate and TRH receptors in the subpopulation of cells responsive to multiple HRHs might have a functional meaning, perhaps related to phenotypic plasticity and long-term regulation of hormone secretion by the anterior pituitary.—Villalobos, C., Múñez, L., García-Sancho, J.

Stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells and MRC-5 fibroblasts with bFGF results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, of which the most prominent has been designated as p90. The phosphorylation of p90 is observed within 30 s of treating the cells with FGF but not with other growth factors. Microsequencing of p90 resolved on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated an N-terminal amino acid sequence which corresponded to a protein previously named as 80K-H. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the predicted C terminus of 80K-H recognized p90 on all Western blots. p90 was found to bind specifically to GRB-2-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and to be immunoreactive with 80K-H antibody. In addition, anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies immunoprecipitated 80K-H from cell lysates of FGF-stimulated but not from control fibroblasts. The biological function of 80K-H is yet unknown. However, from this study and a previous observation of the obligatory dependence of p90 phosphorylation on FGF receptor occupation, it appears that 80K-H is involved in FGF signaling.

These polypeptides are important regulators of differentiation and embryogenesis; they support the survival of neuronal cells and are extremely potent inducers of DNA synthesis in ectoderm- or mesoderm-derived cell types, including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells(1.Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FGFs elicit cellular responses by binding to and activating high affinity FGF receptor tyrosine kinases(2.Johnson D.E.

Biol. 1995; 5: 500-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In agreement with the general scheme for receptor tyrosine kinases, ligand binding induces dimerization of FGF receptors, followed by activation of the intrinsic kinase activity and autophosphorylation of the receptor molecules(2.Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Two autophosphorylation sites in FGFR-1 have been identified. One, Tyr-653(4.Hou J. Kan M. McKeehan K. McBride G. Adams P. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1991; 251: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), is located in the kinase domain and could have a regulatory role. The other, Tyr-766, has been shown to mediate the direct binding of phospholipase C-γ(5.Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).The signal transduction pathways following activation of FGF receptors are thought to be primarily mediated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of key substrates, as is the case with other receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition to phospholipase C-γ, several other substrates have been identified, including SHC(6.Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Formi G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that p90 phosphorylation was induced in cells transfected with both the FGFR-1 and the keratinocyte growth factor receptor, but not the FGFR-4(11.Landgren E. Blume-Jensen P. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2027-2035PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of p90 would thus be relevant to our understanding of the complexity of FGF signaling.Recent investigations have shown that receptor tyrosine kinases link to downstream signaling components, like ERKs, via adaptor proteins that have no apparent enzymatic function but trigger off signaling cascades by assembling proteins into reactive complexes. Protein-protein interactions occur via binding of modular domains on the adaptor protein, such as Src homology 2 (SH2), Src homology 3 (SH3), pleckstrin homology, and phosphotyrosine-binding domains, to specific sequence motifs on the target proteins(17.Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 18.Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). One such adaptor protein, GRB-2, essentially consists of two SH3 domains flanking a solitary SH2 domain. GRB-2 has been shown to bind to autophosphorylated receptors such as those of EGF, PDGF, CSF-1, and insulin, as well as to tyrosine-phosphorylated, non-receptor proteins such as the insulin receptor substrate (IRS). Recently, GRB-2-GST fusion proteins were also used to identify novel tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that bind to GRB-2(19.Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Panchamoorthy G. Soltoff S. Trub T. Druker B.

The collective evidence points to the identity of p90 as 80K-H, a protein whose function has not been characterized. Our studies suggest the involvement of 80K-H in FGF signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents, Antibodies, and GST Fusion ProteinsMonoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY20H), SHC, and PTP1D were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) conjugated to agarose was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgGs and hydrogen peroxide were from Sigma. CSF-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1, transforming growth factor-β, EGF, IL-6, and PDGF were from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Basic FGF was from Boehringer Mannheim. Fusion proteins consisting of GRB-2 (whole protein), GRB-2 (SH3 domain, amino acids 1-68 or 156-199), GRB-2 (SH2 domain, amino acids 54-164), all fused with GST and conjugated to agarose were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). ECL reagents were obtained from Amersham (Bucks, United Kingdom) and Boehringer Mannheim.Cells and Cell StimulationHuman MRC-5 fibroblasts (American Tissue Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown as described previously(23.Cairns J. Qin S. Philp R. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9176-9183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One hour before stimulation with the various agonists, the cells were washed twice with serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium and then incubated with the same medium until the cells were lysed. Swiss 3T3 cells (American Tissue Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. When the cells were 80-90% confluent, the medium was aspirated, the cells washed and maintained for another 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Various agonists were added to the quiescent cells prior to the medium being aspirated, the cells rapidly washed in cold PBS, and lysed for subsequent analysis.Subcellular FractionationAfter stimulation, cells in 15-cm dishes were washed with Buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM benzamidine, 10 mM sodium fluoride). The plates were well drained of Buffer A and replaced with 1 ml of homogenization buffer (Buffer A containing 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA plus protease inhibitors 250 μg/ml leupeptin, 150 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were scraped and homogenized with 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer with a tight-fitting pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 90,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor at 4°C. The supernatant (cytosolic extract) was added with 500 μl of 5 × Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10 min. The pellet (membrane) was extracted for 20 min on ice with 1 ml of Buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM benzamidine, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 plus other protease inhibitors used in Buffer A). The detergent-soluble proteins were collected by centrifugation at room temperature at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant containing the detergent-soluble fraction (membrane extract) was added with 500 μl of 5 × Laemmli buffer and boiled as above.Resolution of the p90 Protein on Two-dimensional PAGETwo 15-cm plates of MRC-5 cells were prepared as above for stimulation with bFGF for 10 min. After washing with cold PBS, each plate of cells was lysed in 500 μl of the lysis buffer used by Coughlin et al.(13.Coughlin S.R. Barr P.J. Cousens L.S. Fretto L.J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 988-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 200 μl of 5 × Laemmli buffer was added to each aliquot, and after boiling for 10 min the entire lysate was loaded onto each side of a one-dimensional PAGE minigel (Bio-Rad). Prestained molecular size markers (Bio-Rad) were used to track the running of the gel in order to excise a section of separated proteins between 85 and 100 kDa. The excised gel sections were stained in 0.1% bromphenol blue and cut into small cubes using a clean scalpel blade. Proteins were eluted from the gel pieces in a Little Blue Tank electrophoretic elution tank (ISCO, Lincoln, NE) with elution buffer (12.5 mM Tris base, 95 mM glycine, 0.05%, w/v, SDS). The electro-eluate was dialyzed against 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS before the proteins were precipitated by adding two volumes of acetone and incubating on ice for 30 min. The precipitated protein was collected by maximal centrifugation in a bench-top microcentrifuge (Eppendorf) for 15 min at 4°C. The protein pellet was solubilized in two-dimensional PAGE sample loading buffer as described previously (24.Guy G.R. Philp R. Tan Y.H. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and loaded onto the first dimension of the Millipore Investigator two-dimensional electrophoresis system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The running conditions were essentially as described previously(23.Cairns J. Qin S. Philp R. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9176-9183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the first dimensional isoelectric focusing tubes were reduced to 7.5 cm in length and the second dimension was run on a minigel apparatus (Bio-Rad), followed by electroblotting in a miniblot apparatus (Bio-Rad) onto PVDF membranes. Isoelectric point markers (Bio-Rad) were used for calibrating the first-dimensional isoelectric focusing. Prestained molecular weight markers (Sigma) for the second dimension were prepared in 1% agarose and cast into capillary tubes. The membrane was stained with Amido Black, washed in deionized water and wrapped in plastic sheet for photocopying. The membrane was then probed with PY20H antibody and the location of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins visualized by ECL (Amersham). The location of any Amido Black-stained spots coinciding with the p90 phosphotyrosine signal was noted.Microsequencing of p90 from PVDF MembraneA duplicate experiment was performed with the intention of microsequencing the p90 protein obtained from the membrane stained with Amido Black. The putative p90 spot on the stained membrane was excised and subjected to direct N-terminal microsequencing. The excised membrane was loaded into a blot cartridge of a protein sequencer (Procise, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and run using cycles recommended by the manufacturer. The amino acid sequence obtained was searched against protein data bases using the BLAST facility (NCBI). The remaining membrane was probed with PY20H antibody to confirm the removal of the p90 phosphotyrosine signal.Preparation and Purification of Polyclonal 80K-H AntibodiesPeptides corresponding to the 14 N-terminal amino acids (VEVKRPRGVSLTNH) and the 14 C-terminal amino acids (PPPEAPTEDDHDEL) of the predicted human 80K-H protein sequence were synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and injected into rabbits by Neosystems Laboratoire (Strasbourg, France). Two C-terminal antibodies designated 80K-H-1029 and 80K-H-1030, and one N-terminal antibody designated 80K-H-1031, recognized a protein on one- and two-dimensional immunoblots that corresponded to the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein p90. These polyclonal antibodies were purified on peptide affinity columns prepared by coupling the synthetic peptide to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The column, containing 1 ml of coupled gel, was equilibrated with five gel volumes of PBS. 0.5 ml of the antibody-containing serum was diluted with 0.5 ml of PBS and clarified through a 0.22-μm filter. The diluted serum was mixed with the equilibrated gel and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Unbound proteins were collected in the flow-through. The column was then washed with 5 ml of PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.5 M NaCl). Bound proteins were eluted in five fractions of 2 ml of IgG elution buffer (Pierce). The fractions were neutralized immediately with 1 M Tris-HCl to pH 7.5 and assayed by immunoblotting cell lysates known to contain the 80K-H protein.Immunoprecipitation and Western BlottingImmunoprecipitations using the 80K-H antibody were performed as follows; 80 μl of lysate (containing membrane proteins from one 15-cm plate of MRC-5 cells) was added to 400 μl of affinity-purified 80K-H antibody and 480 μl of 2 × immunoprecipitation buffer (2% Triton X-100, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 0.4 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mM PMSF, 1% Nonidet P-40). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4°C. 50 μl of anti-rabbit IgG, conjugated to agarose beads were then added and the incubation continued for another 1 h. The beads were then washed three times in 1 × immunoprecipitation buffer before boiling with 30 μl of Laemmli buffer. The supernatant from the boiled beads was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analyses have been described previously(27.Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The commercial antibodies were used according to manufacturers' recommendations.Binding Experiments with GRB-2 and Its SH2 and SH3 DomainsCells were serum-starved as described above before stimulation and lysis. The cells were treated with bFGF (10 ng/ml) or with PDGF (50 ng/ml) or with diluent only. After washing with cold PBS, the cells were lysed with 500 μl/plate of an Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 30 mM Na4P2O7, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mM genistein). The lysates were spun in a bench-top centrifuge at full speed for 10 min, and the resultant pellet was discarded. The protein content of the lysate was assayed with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Lysate protein (2 mg/ml) was used for each experiment. Lysate (500 μl) was added to 500 μl of GRB-2 association buffer (2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 30 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 0.4 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and 20 μl of GRB-2-GST protein fusion beads were added and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of 1 × GRB-2 association buffer before the bound proteins were released by boiling with 30 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer for 5 min. The supernatant was subjected to one- or two-dimensional PAGE and the separated proteins visualized by incubating with the appropriate antibodies and ECL. Controls consisted of GST linked to agarose beads or agarose beads alone.RESULTSA Protein Designated as p90 Is Rapidly and Uniquely Tyrosine-phosphorylated following FGF StimulationSwiss mouse 3T3 or human MRC-5 fibroblasts were used to study the time course of protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by bFGF. Cells were lysed after stimulation, followed by resolution of the cellular proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electroblotting onto PVDF membranes, and probing with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20H). Our observations were similar to previous reports(13.Coughlin S.R. Barr P.J. Cousens L.S. Fretto L.J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 988-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where p90 tyrosine phosphorylation is induced as early as 30 s after addition of bFGF and the response is detectable at doses as low as 0.5 ng/ml (data not shown). The level of phosphorylation peaked between 5 and 10 min and dropped slightly by 30 min. However, others have previously shown that p90 phosphorylation is sustained for at least 4 h and appears to be directly dependent on the continuous occupancy of the FGF receptor (13.Coughlin S.R. Barr P.J. Cousens L.S. Fretto L.J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 988-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We then investigated whether this p90 response can be elicited by other growth factors and agonists. Different ligands were added to either Swiss 3T3 or MRC-5 cells, and the phosphotyrosine profiles of total lysates were compared to that obtained with bFGF (Fig. 1, lane 3). Neither EGF, when added to MRC-5 cells (lane 2), nor PDGF, when added to Swiss 3T3 cells (lane 8), was able to induce the phosphorylation of p90 although these ligands induced tyrosine phosphorylation of more proteins than bFGF in the respective cells. A similar lack of p90 phosphorylation was observed when hydrogen peroxide (a putative activator of tyrosine kinases and/or inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases) was added to MRC-5 cells (lane 4). IL-6, which causes tyrosine phosphorylation through the recruitment of Janus kinases to its receptor components, was unable to induce phosphorylation of p90 in Swiss 3T3 cells (lane 6). Other ligands which are known to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation and/or gene induction in these fibroblasts were also unable to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of p90. These included both human and murine homologues of α/β and γ interferons, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1, CSF-1, and transforming growth factor-β (data not shown).Tyrosine-phosphorylated p90 Is Located in the MembraneThe subcellular location of the tyrosine-phosphorylated p90 protein was ascertained by fractionating the cell into cytosolic and membrane extracts after treatment with bFGF. These fractions, along with total cell lysates from stimulated and unstimulated cells, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were visualized by ECL after probing with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20H). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p90 occurs only in the membrane fraction of bFGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 2, lane 4) as opposed to the cytosolic fraction from the same cells (lane 3). This membrane p90 protein co-migrated with p90 from the total cell lysate of bFGF-stimulated cells (lane 2). It is noteworthy that the summation of lanes 3 and 4 corresponded well with lane 2.Figure 2:Subcellular localization of p90. Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with bFGF (10 ng/ml) for 10 min and the fractionated extracts prepared for immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, total cell extracts from untreated cells; lane 2, total cell extracts from cells treated with bFGF; lane 3, cytosolic fraction from cells treated with bFGF; lane 4, membrane fraction from cells treated with bFGF. The arrow indicates the location of p90.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The identification and characterization of p90, which is so far the only protein to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation uniquely in response to FGF, may be relevant to understanding the specificity of FGF signaling.Two-dimensional Electrophoretic Resolution and Identification of p90For the partial purification of p90, MRC-5 cells were stimulated with bFGF for 10 min and the cell lysates resolved by two-dimensional PAGE (see “Experimental Procedures”). A prominent phosphotyrosine spot appeared on the blot (Fig. 3A) at a molecular mass of 90 kDa and an acidic pI of 4.5, which coincided with a group of three closely spaced spots stained by Amido Black. The corresponding protein spots from a parallel experiment, that does not involve PY20H probing, were excised and used for direct N-terminal sequencing. One unambiguous amino acid sequence was obtained (VEVKRPRGVSLTNHHFYD) which matched exactly with the first eighteen residues from the truncated N terminus of a human protein designated as 80K-H(25.Sakai K. Hirai M. Minoshima S. Kudoh J. Fukuyama R. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1989; 5: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 3B.Figure 3:Location of p90 on two-dimensional PAGE and its identification. A, MRC-5 cells were stimulated with bFGF (10 ng/ml) and the whole cell lysate was prepared for separation by two-dimensional PAGE, following an enrichment by band excision around 90 kDa, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The two-dimensional Western blot was incubated with PY20H antibody and visualized by ECL. The arrow indicates the location of p90. B, microsequencing of the p90 protein indicated an 18-amino acid peptide that corresponded to the truncated N terminus of the previously sequenced 80K-H protein(25.Sakai K. Hirai M. Minoshima S. Kudoh J. Fukuyama R. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1989; 5: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The first 14 residues (bold type) are not present in mature cellular protein. The experimentally obtained sequence is boxed within the full human 80K-H protein. A probable calcium-binding EF-hand domain is underlined, and the C-terminal HDEL sequence, a potential endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, is indicated in italics. C, the two-dimensional PAGE blot shown in A was stripped and reprobed with the 80K-H-1030 antibody and visualized by ECL. The arrow indicates the location of p90.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rabbits were immunized with synthetic peptides derived from the experimental N terminus and the deduced C terminus of the protein. Two antibodies (80K-H-1029 and 80K-H-1030) raised against the 14-residue C-terminal peptide and one (80K-H-1031) raised against the 14-residue N-terminal peptide recognized a protein that co-migrates on two-dimensional PAGE gel with the heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated p90 protein in FGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 3C). Control Western blots using the respective preimmune sera did not detect any spots at 90 kDa (data not shown).Immunoprecipitation studies carried out with crude or purified 80K-H antibodies were not successful. However, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation clearly indicated that 80K-H is tyrosine-phosphorylated only in the bFGF-stimulated but not control cells (Fig. 4). MRC-5 cells were treated with bFGF for 10 min and separated into cytosol and membrane fractions. The membrane pellet was solubilized in SDS-containing buffer and incubated with 4G10 antibody conjugated to agarose. In Fig. 4, 80K-H is detected at 90 kDa in lane 4, which corresponds to tyrosine phosphoproteins derived from bFGF-stimulated cells. No 80K-H is detectable in immunoprecipitates obtained from unstimulated cells (lane 3). Although the amount of lysates used for immunoprecipitation in lanes 3 and 4 is about 20-fold higher than the loading in lanes 1 and 2, the signal for 80K-H is stronger in the latter lanes. This implies that the tyrosine-phosphorylated 80K-H represents only a small fraction of the total cellular 80K-H.Figure 4:Detection of 80K-H in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. MRC-5 cells were stimulated with bFGF(10 ng/ml) or with diluent alone, and the membrane fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10 conjugated to agarose). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by one-dimensional PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membrane, incubated with 80K-H antibody, and visualized by ECL. Lanes 1 and 2 correspond to membrane lysates from control and stimulated cells, respectively. Lanes 3 and 4 contain the phosphotyrosine proteins from the respective lysates.

https://openalex.org/W1964631363,"The rabbit cardiac/slow twitch muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2⁺-ATPase (SERCA2) gene encodes a Ca2⁺ transport pump whose expression is regulated during skeletal and cardiac muscle development and in response to various pathophysiological and hormonal states. Employing transient transfection analyses in Sol8 muscle cells, we have identified two positive regulatory regions, one distal (−1810 base pair (bp) to −1110 bp) and one proximal (−284 bp to −72 bp), within the SERCA2 promoter. The proximal promoter region from −284 bp to −80 bp was shown to confer muscle-specific expression to a heterologous promoter in Sol8 cells. This region is highly GC-rich containing the consensus sequence for four Sp1 elements (GGGCGG) and three Sp1-like elements (GGGAGG). DNase I footprint analysis with Sol8 nuclear extracts and purified Sp1 protein showed the protection of the seven Sp1 binding sites. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of the Sp1 consensus sites demonstrated that Sp1 sites are essential for the muscle-specific expression of the SERCA2 promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cotransfection of an Sp1 expression vector together with SERCA2-CAT constructs can up-regulate SERCA2 promoter activity. These results imply that the Sp1 transcription factor plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of SERCA2 within muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1977672022,"The functional importance of cysteine residues in the extracellular domain and the extracellular loops (EL1 and EL2) to hormone binding of the rat luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) was investigated. For this purpose, cysteines in the seven-transmembrane holoreceptor (Form A) and its hormone-binding splice variant (Form B) were replaced by serine residues, and mutant receptors were expressed in COS1 and/or insect cells. Within the extracellular domain, individual replacement of all four cysteines from Exon 1 abolished hormone binding activity, and replacement of Cys-109 and Cys-134 from exons 5 and 6 caused a 75% decrease in both cell surface and total cellular solubilized LHR hormone binding activity. Mutations of Cys-257 and −258 (Exon 9), Cys-321 and −331, and Cys-417 and −492 of EL1 and EL2, respectively (Exon 11), showed no surface hormone binding activity on intact cells, but exhibited wild type levels of total hormone binding activity when recovered from detergent-solubilized cellular extracts. This finding indicated that expression of high affinity LHR binding activity at the cell surface is independent of the acquisition of the high affinity binding conformation. Other cysteine residues, including Cys-282 (exon 10), and Cys-314 (exon 11) were not essential for hormone binding activity or plasma membrane insertion. This study demonstrates that the functional hormone binding domain utilizes all cysteines N-terminal to exon 7 and localizes the binding site to this N-terminal region of the extracellular domain. The functional importance of cysteine residues in the extracellular domain and the extracellular loops (EL1 and EL2) to hormone binding of the rat luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) was investigated. For this purpose, cysteines in the seven-transmembrane holoreceptor (Form A) and its hormone-binding splice variant (Form B) were replaced by serine residues, and mutant receptors were expressed in COS1 and/or insect cells.

INTRODUCTIONThe luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) ( 1The abbreviations used are: LHRluteinizing hormone receptorFSHRfollicle-stimulating hormone receptorTSHRthyrotropin receptorLHluteinizing hormonehCGhuman chorionic gonadotropinWTwild-typePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) is a seven-transmembrane (1.McFarland K. Sprengel R. Phillips H.S. Kohler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1969; 245: 494-496Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar) G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a high affinity hormone binding site on the N-terminal extracellular domain (Fig. 1)(2.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Xie Y.B. Wang H. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hormone binding domain is composed of two Cys-rich regions in exons 1 and 9, generally conserved in the glycoprotein hormone receptor family (FSHR and TSHR), and bordering a leucine-rich domain that is repeated from exons 2 to 8(4.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Xie X.-Z. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11355-11359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A third Cys-rich region (Cys-314, −321, and −331) is located outside of the hormone binding domain although still in the extracellular region and is also conserved in the FSHR (5.Sprengel R. Braun T. Nikolics K. Segaloff D. Seeburg P.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and TSHR(6.Nagayama Y. Kaufman K.D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The LHR contains only three cysteines within the extracellular domain that are not conserved in the FSHR and TSHR, at Cys-109, Cys-134, and Cys-282 (Fig. 1). These cysteines are within domains that have been implicated to be of importance to LH/hCG binding in chimeric studies of the glycoprotein hormones(7.Nagayama Y. Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Outside of the N-terminal extracellular domain, two LHR cysteines on EL-1 and EL-2 are conserved in most of the GPCR and are of structural importance to the adrenergic/rhodopsin family(8.Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.-B Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9.Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9266-9270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid homology within the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the GPCR have led investigators to propose the existence of a common mode of signal transfer and G coupling that may involve the formation or disruption of disulfide bonds(10.Robillard G.T. Konings W.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11.Kuhl P.W. Experientia. 1985; 41: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).To study the importance of cysteines and disulfide bonding to LHR hormone binding, the indicated cysteines (SH) (Fig. 1) in the rat holoreceptor were mutated to the amino acid serine (OH) and expressed in the mammalian COS1 cell. The substitution of Cys to Ser prevents the formation of a putative disulfide bond, without significantly affecting the charge characteristics of the protein(12.Savarese T.M. Wang C.-D. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11439-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated hormone binding domain was studied in both the COS1 cell and the insect Sf9 cell with the soluble splice variant Form B that contains the high affinity hormone binding domain without the transmembrane, extracellular loops, or cytoplasmic domain(2.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This constitutes amino acids 1-294 of the holoreceptor and a unique 22-amino acid tail that contains one additional cysteine that may functionally substitute for a Cys in the holoreceptor. Our results demonstrate that only the four Cys within exon 1 are essential for hormone binding activity and that the two unique Cys at 109 and 134 are of importance, although not essential to hormone binding. The extracellular Cys (257, 258, 321, and 331) and EL1 417 and EL2 492 that are conserved in all of the glycoprotein hormone receptors are required for membrane insertion, but they do not contribute to hormone binding activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSDesign of LHR Form A and B Wild-type and Mutant DNA ConstructsThe full-length rat ovarian LH/CG receptor (LHR Form A) cDNA was subcloned into the human cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression vector, pCMV4 (gift from Dr. D. Russell, University of Texas Southern Medical Center), as described previously(2.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LHR mutants were constructed using the recombinant circle polymerase chain reaction (13.Jones D.H. Howard B.H. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides (Midland Certified Reagent Company, Midland, TX) were designed to individually replace Cys-8, −12, −14, −22, −109, −134, −257, −258, −282, −314, −321, −331, −417, and −492 with serine (Fig. 1). WT and mutant Form B cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) for infection of insect cells. The orientation of the WT and mutant Form A and Form B constructs was determined by restriction enzyme analysis, and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.Expression of WT and Mutant LHR in Mammalian COS1 and Insect CellsWT and mutant LHR cDNAs in pCMV4 expression vectors were transfected in mammalian COS1 cells by the LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) method according to manufacturer's protocol. The expressed membrane-bound receptor activity was determined by 125I-hCG binding 48 h after transfection(2.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-hCG (specific activity, 40.6 μCi/μg, 48% maximal bindability) was prepared by a modification of a lactoperoxidase method as described previously(14.Catt K.J. Ketelslegers J.-M. Dufau M.L. Blecher M. Methods in Receptor Research. 1. Marcel Dekker, NY1976: 175-183Google Scholar). Spodoptera frugipera (Sf9) cells (PharMingen) were co-transfected with 4 μg of WT or mutant LHR Form B (pVL1393LHRB) and 0.5 μg of BaculoGold(™) DNA (PharMingen) according to manufacturer's protocol. The recombinant virus titers were amplified by reinfection of Sf9 cells, and titers were monitored by plaque assay. The overexpression of WT and mutant LHRs was achieved by infecting Sf9 cells (7 × 106 cells/75-cm2 flask) with recombinant virus (108 plaque-forming units; multiplicity of infection = 10) at 27°C for 2 h. At 48 h postinfection, the cells were harvested, washed, and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 24 trypsin inhibitor units of Trasylol (aprotinin, Sigma). The cell homogenates in 20% glycerol were stored at −70°C for further studies.Preparation of Detergent-solubilized Extracts of Transfected COS1 Cells and Sf9 CellsCOS1 Cells48 h after transfection with WT or mutant LHR cDNAs, COS1 cells were recovered, homogenized, and solubilized as described previously(2.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL).Sf9 Cells48 h postinfection with recombinant virus, Sf9 cells were homogenized with 50 strokes at 1800 rpm of a tissue grinder (Potter-Elvehjem, Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ); glycerol and Nonidet P-40 were added to final concentrations of 20 and 1%, respectively. Extract was rotated for 1 h at 4°C and diluted to a final Nonidet P-40 concentration of 0.1%. The solubilized mixture was centrifuged, and protein concentration was determined as described above.125I-hCG binding to LHRIntact COS1 cells or solubilized extracts from transfected COS1 or insect Sf9 cells were used for 125I-hCG binding assay as described previously(2.Tsai-Morris C.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Binding was performed using displacement assays by incubating intact cells or solubilized extracts with 125I-hCG and increasing concentration of unlabeled hCG. Nonspecific binding was determined in samples containing an excess of the unlabeled hCG (1 μg). The binding parameters (Ka and binding capacities) were analyzed from Scatchard plots and saturation curves using a nonlinear model curve-fitting program(15.Ketelslegers J.-M. Knott G.D. Catt K.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least 3 times in triplicate. Statistical analysis for all studies were performed using analysis of variance (Supernova, Berkeley, CA) and Post Hoc Fisher LSD tests at the 99% significance level.Western Blot Analysis of Wild-type and Mutant LH/CG ReceptorAliquots of Form B LHR (100 ng) from detergent-solubilized Sf9 cells transfected with WT and mutant cDNAs were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer (reducing conditions: final concentration, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2%β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.02% bromphenol blue; nonreducing conditions: final concentration, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.02% bromphenol blue). Holoreceptor (~50 ng) purified from ovarian membranes as described previously (16.Dufau M.L. Litwack G. Receptor Purification. The Humana Press Inc., Philadelphia, PA1990: 147-171Crossref Google Scholar) was denatured and prepared as above under reducing or nonreducing conditions. The truncated splice variant (Form B) or the holoreceptor (Form A) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis analysis. Following transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), the LH/CG receptor was probed with 1:800 dilution of immunoaffinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against an peptide antigen (amino acids 36-51) of the rat LH/CG receptor for 1 h at 22°C and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit antiserum conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaitherburg, MD) (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at 22°C. Membranes was washed and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Corp.).Ligand BlotSamples processed as for Western blot analysis (nonreducing or reducing conditions; see above) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. Binding of hCG to WT and mutant receptor was performed by incubation of the blots with 125I-hCG (106 cpm/ml) for 16 h at 4°C in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled hCG (1 μg/ml). The blots were processed and autoradiographed as described previously(16.Dufau M.L. Litwack G. Receptor Purification. The Humana Press Inc., Philadelphia, PA1990: 147-171Crossref Google Scholar).RadioimmunoassayLHR expressed from Sf9 cells or COS1 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant LH receptor form B or A cDNAs, respectively, were quantitated by radioimmunoassay using affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against rat LH receptor peptide antigen 36-51 as described previously(17.Zhang R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18267-18271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ~1-25 μg of crude homogenates from Sf9 cell and 25-200 μg of particulate protein from COS1 cells were suspended in 100 μl of radioimmunoassay buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 12 mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma) and 24 trypsin inhibitor units of Trasylol (aprotinin, Sigma)) and incubated with 100 μl of LH receptor (36-51) antibody (final dilution 1:3000), 200 μl of radioimmunoassay buffer, and 50,000 dpm of 125I-labeled peptide (36-51) (specific activity, 176 Ci/mmol) for 24 h at 4°C. Separation of antibody bound from free peptide was performed as described previously(17.Zhang R. Cai H. Fatima N. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18.Koh Y.C. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18267-18271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sample values were derived from reference standard curves (ID50 of displacement of 0.15 pmol/assay tube). Assays were performed in triplicate with at least three dilutions. The interassay coefficient of variation was 5%, and the intraassay coefficient of variation was 8%. Expressed wild-type and mutant LHR concentrations from COS1 and insect cells displayed parallelism to the standard curve, while samples from cells transfected with the expression vector only showed no displacement.cAMP DeterminationcAMP generation from COS1 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant LHRs in the presence of a range of hCG concentrations was determined by radioimmunoassay as described previously(19.Dufau M.L.

A. 1977; 74: 3419-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).All experiments described above were performed at least 3 times in triplicate.RESULTSTransfection of the LHR holoreceptor Form A into the COS1 cell yields a high affinity hCG hormone binding receptor that is translocated to the cell surface. Scatchard analysis of the surface wild-type holoreceptor reveals that the dissociation constant Kd of the LHR holoreceptor expressed in COS1 cell is similar to that of the rat ovarian LH receptor(2.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Kusuda S. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16161-16168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar hormone binding affinities were also obtained with expression of the Form B splice variant in COS1 or insect Sf9 cells(17.Zhang R. Cai H. Fatima N. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Individual mutation of each of the cysteines in exon 1 to Ser of the holoreceptor expressed from the COS1 cell (Cys 8, 12, 14, 22) or the Form B splice variant expressed in the insect cell (Cys 8, 12, 14, 22) resulted in total loss of hormone binding activity (Table 1, Fig. 2 and 3). Receptor activity was not recovered in the detergent solubilized fraction of the COS1 cell (Fig. 2), indicating that loss of activity was not due to entrapment within the cells. To confirm that Cys-8 → Ser, Cys-12 → Ser, Cys-14 → Ser, and Cys-22 → Ser was expressed, the concentration of receptors was determined by specific radioimmunoassay. Mutant receptor levels of Cys-8 → Ser and Cys-22 → Ser were within 60% that of wild-type, and Cys-12 → Ser and Cys-14 → Ser levels were not significantly different from wild-type (Table 2).Table 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2:Percent wild-type 125I-hCG binding activity of designated CysLHRSer holoreceptor mutant proteins expressed from COS1 cells. ∗, no significant difference from basic vector without insert.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table 1 Open table in a new tab Substitution of the unique cysteines from exon 5 and 6 (Cys-109 and Cys-134) caused a 75% decrease in hormone binding activity on the surface of the intact cell that could not be recovered in detergent-solubilized extracts (Figure 2:, Figure 4:). Expression levels of these mutant LHRs were not significantly different from wild-type (Table 2, Fig. 4), indicating that substitution of Cys-109 and −134 specifically affects hormone binding but not receptor expression. In addition, these cysteines do not appear to play a role in membrane insertion since the proportion of active mutant to wild-type LHR was the same for surface and solubilized receptors (approximately 25%). Ser-134 LHR exhibited a marked reduction in maximal hormonal activation of cAMP in comparison with the wild-type. This reduction of 80 ± 15% was consistent with the 75% decrease in hormone binding activity, and similarly substitution of Cys-109 reduced maximal hormonal stimulation (Table 2).Figure 4:Displacement curves of 125I-hCG binding to wild-type and mutant Cys-109 and −134 mutant LHR holoreceptor expressed in COS1 cells.

Chem. 1986; 261: 16161-16168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by designated LHR wild-type and mutant receptors. The extracts of samples displayed parallel displacement to the standard curve. No displacement was observed by extracts from cells transfected with vector in the absence of LHR insert.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Individual substitution of the two consecutive cysteines within exon 9 (Cys-257 and −258) (Fig. 1), which are conserved in all of the glycoprotein hormone receptors, resulted in total loss of surface binding activity (Fig. 2). However, 70-100% of the wild-type hormone binding activity was recovered following detergent solubilization. (Table 1, Fig. 2). To determine whether Cys-257 functionally replaced Cys-258 in the Cys-258 → Ser mutant, the double mutant Cys-257 → Ser/Cys-258 → Ser was expressed from COS1 cells and characterized for hormone binding activity. Detergent extracts from cells expressing the double mutant also displayed 90% of the wild-type hormone binding activity. The binding affinities (Ka) of these mutant receptors were identical to that of wild-type (Table 1). Thus, it does not appear that Cys-257 or −258 are important for hCG hormone binding.Substitution of Cys-282 → Ser (Fig. 1), which is not conserved in the FSHR or TSHR, resulted in a mutant receptor with impaired but not total loss of surface hormone binding activity (Fig. 2; Table 1, Table 1). Cys-282 → Ser exhibited a 50% reduction in surface receptor hormone binding activity, with a binding affinity that was similar to wild-type (Table 1). However, total detergent solubilization of this mutant yielded total receptor binding concentrations that were similar to wild-type (Table 1, Table 1). Hormonal stimulation caused dose-related increases in cAMP levels in cells transfected with this mutant, and maximal levels were 51 ± 2% that of wild-type. This correlated with the 50% reduction in surface receptor (Table 2). Thus, Cys-282, which is unique to the LHR, is not important for either hCG hormone binding or signal transfer, but it does contribute to surface membrane expression.Cys-314, −321, and −331; Cys-417; and Cys-492 are not contained in the Form B hormone binding domain, although these are present in the extracellular N-terminal, and EC loops 1 and 2, respectively, of the holoreceptor (Fig. 1). Substitution of Cys-314 → Ser did not affect either hormone binding affinity or membrane insertion (Table 2, Fig. 2), or cAMP levels (not shown). Thus Ser-314 is functionally equivalent to Cys-314, and Cys-314 does not have to be paired in a disulfide bond in the holoreceptor for binding activity. Substitution of Cys-321, Cys-331, Cys-417, and Cys-492 by Ser resulted in mutant receptors that exhibited no surface binding activities. However, binding activity of these mutant LHRs were recovered in detergent-solubilized extracts (Table 1 and II; Fig. 2).The importance of disulfide bonds to hormone binding activity was investigated in ligand blots using the Form B splice variant expressed in insect cells and the affinity-purified Form A holoreceptor isolated from ovarian membranes. Treatment of the 38-kDa Form B receptor with reducing agent prior to electrophoretic separation, and transfer to nitrocellulose, did not reduce the ability of the electroblotted receptor to bind labeled hCG (Fig. 5, LHRB, reducing and nonreducing). These results, and those reported recently(17.Zhang R. Cai H. Fatima N. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), indicate that the initial oxidation state does not affect the ability of the Form B LHR to renature during the electroblotting transfer to nitrocellulose membrane.Figure 5:Western and ligand blots of Form A (holoreceptor) and B (splice variant) wild-type LHR under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Left, LHR in sample buffer was either reduced with β-mercaptoethanol (R) or not reduced (NR) prior to SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were subsequently electroblotted to nitrocellulose and probed with the LHR peptide (36-51) antibody. Right, ligand blot probed with 125I-hCG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast, prior incubation of the Form A holoreceptor with reductant severely impaired the ability of the receptor to bind hormone after electrophoresis in ligand blots (Fig. 5, LHRA, reducing versus nonreducing). Thus, the addition of the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains presumably has a negative effect on renaturation of the reduced LHR on nitrocellulose (see “Discussion”). A minor aggregate (>200 kDa), more pronounced under nonreducing conditions, exhibits no detectable ligand binding (Fig. 5, left, LHRA, reducing and nonreducing versus right, LHRA, reducing and nonreducing).The ability of the reduced, denatured wild-type Form B LHR to recover its active configuration and bind hormone in ligand blots raises the question of whether the exon 1 cysteines are essential for renaturation of the mature receptor. Renaturation of the reduced Form B receptor on ligand blots may require the reformation of essential disulfide bonds, which would presumably be prevented in the exon 1 mutant LHRs. The Cys → Ser conservative substitution primarily impacts on loss of disulfide formation in the mutant protein(11.Kuhl P.W. Experientia. 1985; 41: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but it may also result in the loss of essential free cysteines in the exon 1 mutants. Ligand blotting was performed with each of the exon 1 Cys mutant LHRs (Cys-8 → Ser, Cys-12 → Ser, Cys-14 → Ser, Cys-22 → Ser) to resolve two questions. First, whether ligand binding of the reduced wild-type Form B receptor on nitrocellulose was due to renaturation that involved exon 1 cysteines, and perhaps the reformation of disulfide bonds during electroblotting, or the hormone binds to a surface that is exposed on nitrocellulose without the aid of disulfide loops. Second, does the loss of hormone binding activity by the Cys/Ser substitutions in exon 1 result from the loss of required free or disulfide bonded cysteines on the mature receptor or impairment of initial processing of the nascent LHR in the endoplasmic reticulum.None of the exon 1 Form B LHR mutant receptors exhibited hormone binding activity when immobilized on nitrocellulose (Fig. 6), indicating that in contrast to the denatured, reduced wild-type Form B LHR, the exon 1 mutants are incapable of renaturation during electroblotting (Fig. 6). This indicates that Cys-8, −12, −14, and −22 are essential for renaturation of the mature LHR and that therefore these cysteines play an essential role beyond processing of the nascent receptor, perhaps as disulfide-bonded cysteines.Figure 6:Western and ligand blots of Form B LHR wild-type and Exon 1 Cys mutants.

Sakmar T.P. Chen H.-B Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9.Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9266-9270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and those that are conserved in the extracellular domain of the glycoprotein hormone receptor family (Cys-8, −12, −14, and −22 of exon 1, Cys-257 and −258 of exon 9, and Cys-314, −321, and −331 of exon 11), reveal that only the extracellular N-terminal cysteines in exon 1 and Cys-109 and −134 are of importance for hormone binding. A second group of conserved cysteines within the extracellular domain (Cys-257, −258, −321, and −331) and the extracellular loops 1 (417) and 2 (492) are essential for surface expression but not for hormone binding (Table 2).The importance of cysteines to hormone binding and signal transfer in the class 1 GPCR has been well documented(8.Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.-B Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9.Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9266-9270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the implication that disulfide bonds are important for structural integrity and signal relay. The LHR differs from the class 1 GPCR (adrenergic family) by an extended 300-amino acid N-terminal extracellular hormone binding domain that can be physically separated from the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain without loss of hCG hormone binding affinity(2.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Putative disulfide bonds that connect the extracellular domain to the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain are not required for hormone binding activity, and in this study we have found no cysteines including and following the exon 9 position 257/258 that are important for hormone binding.The isolated high affinity hormone binding domain that is represented by the splice variant Form B and consists of exons 1 to 10 carries a unique carboxyl 22-amino acid tail with an extra cysteine (Fig. 1) that is not in the holoreceptor. This cysteine does not function as a replacement for one of the extracellular exon 11 cysteines (Cys-314, −321, −331, −417, or −492), since none of these exon 11 cysteines are important for hormone binding. However, the addition of the Form B cysteine (Cys-305) does cancel out a potential unpaired cysteine (Fig. 1) and may serve to reduce intermolecular aggregation that could result from the reactivity of an unpaired cysteine.The four cysteines in exon 1 are each essential for hormone binding activity, and no other cysteines can replace their functions in the mutant LHRs. In the TSH receptor, mutation of the analogous first three cysteines of exon 1 did not affect TSH binding(21.Kosugi S. San T. Akamizu T. Kohn L.D. Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1754-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that these have a unique function in LH/hCG binding, perhaps forming disulfide bonds with the unique LHR cysteines 109 and 134, which are not conserved in the TSH receptor. Although the four cysteines of the TSHR exon 1 can substitute for the LHR exon 1 in chimeric receptor constructs, hCG binding was only achieved when the segment that includes Cys-109 and −134 of the LHR was also present in the construct (7.Nagayama Y. Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, putative disulfide bonds between cysteines in exon 1 and Cys-109 or Cys-134 should yield equivalent reductions in activity upon mutation of each half cystine, which was not the case in these studies (Table 1, Table 1). Rather, a putative disulfide bond is suggested between Cys-109 and Cys-134 in the hormone binding domain since mutation of each of these resulted in equivalent reductions of binding activity.There is some indication that the extracellular and transmembrane domains are linked by disulfide bonds in the TSH receptor, and LHR-specific interactions between the two domains have also been proposed to account for membrane insertion of the LH receptor(22.Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Our experiments suggest that the LHR extracellular/transmembrane interactions may be in the form of disulfide bonds, similar to the TSHR. Cys-257, −258, −321, and −331 of the extracellular domain and the Cys-417 of EL1 and Cys-492 of EL2, all conserved in the glycoprotein hormone receptors LHR, TSHR, and FSHR, are required for membrane insertion but not hormone binding activity (Table 1). Individual mutation of each of these cysteines prevented surface expression, indicating that the disulfide configuration is highly specific and that other cysteines cannot functionally substitute. Most of these extracellular cysteines that are essential for insertion into the membrane may be important in signal transduction, since they are conserved in all members of the glycoprotein hormone receptor family. The acquisition of the correct disulfide configuration to initiate signal transfer may be a prerequisite for membrane insertion, although, as we have shown, acquisition of the high affinity binding conformation is not a prerequisite for membrane insertion.In studies with bovine opsin, which does not contain an extended extracellular domain, cysteines from extracellular loop 1 and 2 (Cys-110 and −187) were required for membrane insertion(23.Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), similar to our observation with Cys-417 and −492 mutant LHRs. Cys-621 and −622 from the cytoplasmic domain have been reported to be important for membrane insertion(24.Zhu H. Wang H. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 141-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, another report attributes the decrease in surface Cys mutant receptors to an increase in the rate of hormone/receptor internalization(25.Kawate N. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30651-30658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, non-Cys mutations in the transmembrane/cytoplasmic module such as E441Q can also impair membrane insertion(26.Wang Z. Wang H. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 85-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate a wide range of extracellular and transmembrane/cytoplasmic amino acids that are required for membrane insertion of the LHR, suggesting that the total integrity of the exon 7-11 domain is a prerequisite for translocation to the plasma membrane.Previous studies with tunicamycin show that folding of the nascent Form B LHR receptor that lacks the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain, to an active configuration is dependent on the presence of N-linked carbohydrates and not on the initial oxidation state of the receptor(17.Zhang R. Cai H. Fatima N. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have established that the LHR Form B receptor is only capable of spontaneous renaturation during ligand blotting, following SDS denaturation and boiling in the presence or absence of reductant, as long as the receptor carries the proximal N-acetylglucosamine on Asn-173 and Asn-152 (17.Zhang R. Cai H. Fatima N. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and, in this study, the exon 1 cysteines (Fig. 6).Although renaturation of the Form B splice variant did not depend on the initial oxidation state of the receptor, hormone binding of the Form A holoreceptor was greatly reduced when the receptor was treated with reductant prior to electrophoresis and ligand blotting (Fig. 5). The transmembrane domain appears to interfere with renaturation of the extracellular hormone binding domain only when the LHR is in the reduced, free cysteine state prior to electrophoresis/blotting. Fig. 6 suggests that renaturation of the isolated Form B hormone binding domain involves the reformation of exon 1 disulfide bonds, since the primary impact of the conservative substitution of Ser for Cys is in the loss of the ability to form disulfide bonds(12.Savarese T.M. Wang C.-D. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11439-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the Form A holoreceptor, reactive cysteines from the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domain, exposed only under reducing conditions, may interfere with these putative disulfide interactions in the extracellular hormone binding domain, impairing ligand binding.The observation that all but two of the cysteines characterized in this study that were determined to be functional for hormone binding or membrane insertion are conserved indicates that a common disulfide configuration may exist for the glycoprotein receptor family, designed for the general function of membrane insertion. The body of evidence that has accumulated on LHR hormone binding suggests that the extracellular hormone binding domain may be a minimal secondary structural element such as an amphipathic helix, since measurable hCG hormone binding has been surprisingly achieved with small receptor fragments and transmembrane helical domains(27.Ji I. Ji T.H. Endocrinology. 1991; 126: 2648-2650Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). With this in mind, the “spontaneous renaturation” of the hormone binding domain that occurs in ligand blots, even under the extraordinary denaturing conditions that were used for deglycosylation(17.Zhang R. Cai H. Fatima N. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), may instead indicate that extensive renaturation of the LHR does not have to occur for hormone binding and that a minimal Form B receptor domain, exposed on the nitrocellulose membrane, may be sufficient for binding.In summary, the extracellular cysteines in exon 1 (Cys-8, −12, −14, and −22) and exons 5 (Cys-109) and 6 (Cys-134) are important for hormone binding activity; those in exon 1 being essential for activity. The relatively conservative substitution of serine for cysteine suggests that the loss of binding activity may be attributed to the loss of potential disulfide bonds. Cys-257, −258, −282, −321, −331, −417, and −492 were important to various degrees for membrane insertion. Radioimmunoassay studies indicate that while substitution of many of the LHR cysteines resulted in retention of the mutant proteins in the nonsurface membrane fraction, no changes in steady-state concentrations of the receptor were observed. These single substitution experiments demonstrate that specific cysteines in exons 1-6, perhaps through disulfide interaction, are essential/important for the active receptor configuration.

Sprengel R. Phillips H.S. Kohler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1969; 245: 494-496Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar) G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a high affinity hormone binding site on the N-terminal extracellular domain (Fig. 1)(2.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Xie Y.B. Wang H. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hormone binding domain is composed of two Cys-rich regions in exons 1 and 9, generally conserved in the glycoprotein hormone receptor family (FSHR and TSHR), and bordering a leucine-rich domain that is repeated from exons 2 to 8(4.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Xie X.-Z. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11355-11359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A third Cys-rich region (Cys-314, −321, and −331) is located outside of the hormone binding domain although still in the extracellular region and is also conserved in the FSHR (5.Sprengel R. Braun T. Nikolics K. Segaloff D. Seeburg P.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and TSHR(6.Nagayama Y. Kaufman K.D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The LHR contains only three cysteines within the extracellular domain that are not conserved in the FSHR and TSHR, at Cys-109, Cys-134, and Cys-282 (Fig. 1). These cysteines are within domains that have been implicated to be of importance to LH/hCG binding in chimeric studies of the glycoprotein hormones(7.Nagayama Y. Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Outside of the N-terminal extracellular domain, two LHR cysteines on EL-1 and EL-2 are conserved in most of the GPCR and are of structural importance to the adrenergic/rhodopsin family(8.Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.-B Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9.Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9266-9270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid homology within the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the GPCR have led investigators to propose the existence of a common mode of signal transfer and G coupling that may involve the formation or disruption of disulfide bonds(10.Robillard G.T. Konings W.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11.Kuhl P.W. Experientia. 1985; 41: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).To study the importance of cysteines and disulfide bonding to LHR hormone binding, the indicated cysteines (SH) (Fig. 1) in the rat holoreceptor were mutated to the amino acid serine (OH) and expressed in the mammalian COS1 cell. The substitution of Cys to Ser prevents the formation of a putative disulfide bond, without significantly affecting the charge characteristics of the protein(12.Savarese T.M. Wang C.-D. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11439-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated hormone binding domain was studied in both the COS1 cell and the insect Sf9 cell with the soluble splice variant Form B that contains the high affinity hormone binding domain without the transmembrane, extracellular loops, or cytoplasmic domain(2.Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This constitutes amino acids 1-294 of the holoreceptor and a unique 22-amino acid tail that contains one additional cysteine that may functionally substitute for a Cys in the holoreceptor. Our results demonstrate that only the four Cys within exon 1 are essential for hormone binding activity and that the two unique Cys at 109 and 134 are of importance, although not essential to hormone binding. The extracellular Cys (257, 258, 321, and 331) and EL1 417 and EL2 492 that are conserved in all of the glycoprotein hormone receptors are required for membrane insertion, but they do not contribute to hormone binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1666611614,"The Tec family is a recently emerging subfamily among nonreceptor type protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) consisting of Tec, Txk, Btk, Bmx, and Itk/Tsk/Emt. They have a long amino-terminal unique region containing a pleckstrin homology domain and a Tec-homology domain. We could previously show that, through the Tec-homology domain, Tec is bound to Lyn kinase both in vitro and in vivo. Because Tec is coexpressed with Lyn in many hematopoietic cell types, it has been intriguing to investigate the biological role of the Tec-Lyn association. Here we demonstrate that Lyn can phosphorylate tyrosine residues of the Tec protein, and thereby activate Tec in 3T3 fibroblasts. However, coexpression of Tec has little effect on the phospho-tyrosine-contents of Lyn. By using the in vitro kinase assay and the yeast system, we could prove that the Tec protein is a direct substrate of the Lyn kinase both in vitro and in vivo. From this evidence we conclude that Tec acts downstream of Lyn in intracellular signaling pathways. This is a novel case where one PTK is phosphorylated and regulated by another."

The Ca2+ influx pathway involves low conductance Ca2+ channels and is activated, through a poorly understood mechanism, by the loss of Ca2+ from the InsP1-sensitive stores(1.Pozzan T. Rizzuto R.

When cells are exposed to a Ca2+-mobilizing agent in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the SDCI pathway remains activated (even after removal of the Ca2+-mobilizing agent) until Ca2+ is restored and the InsP1-sensitive stores refill with Ca2+. Inhibitors of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase such as thapsigargin (Tg) prevent Ca2+ reaccumulation by the InsP1-sensitive stores, resulting in prolonged activation of SDCI(5.Jackson T.R.

J. 1988; 253: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate Chinese hamster ovary N-methyl-D-glucamine physiological salts solution store-dependent Ca2+ influx thapsigargin 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is a carrier-mediated transport process that couples the transmembrane movement of 3 Na+ ions to the movement of a single Ca2+ in the opposite direction. In cardiac cells, it is widely accepted that the exchanger transports a portion of the Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum out of the cells by Na+o-dependent Ca2+ efflux and in this way regulates the amount of stored Ca2+ available for release during subsequent beats (reviewed in (6.Reeves J.P. Sperelakis N. Physiology and Pathophysiology of the Heart. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1995: 309-318Google Scholar)). However, in many other types of cells the downstream response to Ca2+-mobilizing agents depends more on the sustained influx of Ca2+ following agonist addition than on the magnitude of the Ca2+ transient itself. For noncardiac cells, there is a wealth of evidence supporting the generalized activity of Na+-Ca2+ exchange in mediating Ca2+ efflux and in modulating the Ca2+ content of intracellular stores(7.Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1367-C1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise physiological role of the exchanger and its interactions with other Ca2+ hemeostatic mechanisms is not as clearly defined in noncardiac cells as in myocardial cells. A major difficulty in investigations of exchanger function in intact cells is the absence of a selective inhibitor for exchange activity. In this report, we utilize transfected CHO cells to bypass this limitation. CHO cells do not normally express Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity, but after transfection with an expression vector coding for the bovine cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, high levels of activity are observed(8.Pijuan V.

Comparing the effects of Na+ on Ca2+ mobilization between transfected and vector-transfected control cells provides a means of identifying functional roles of exchange activity in relation to other cellular mechanisms for intracellular Ca2+ handling. The results of this study indicate that Ca2+ efflux via the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger limits the rise in [Ca2+]i during sustained Ca2+ entry, suggesting a potential modulatory function for Na+-Ca2+ exchange in the Ca2+ signaling process. Additional evidence suggests that the exchanger itself undergoes a regulatory activation during Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. CK1.4 cells were prepared by transfection of dhfr-1 Chinese hamster ovary cells with a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA-NEO; Invitrogen) containing a cDNA insert coding for the bovine cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger(8.Pijuan V. Zhuang Y. Smith L. Kroupis C. Condrescu M. Aceto J.F. Reeves J.P. Smith J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1066-C1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control cells were prepared by transfection of the CHO cells with the vector alone (i.e. no insert). The cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 500 μg/ml geneticin (G418) as described(8.Pijuan V. Zhuang Y. Smith L. Kroupis C. Condrescu M. Aceto J.F. Reeves J.P. Smith J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1066-C1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unless specified otherwise, biochemicals were obtained from Sigma. Cells grown in 75-cm2 plastic culture flasks were washed three times with Na-PSS, which contains (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 20 mM Mops, buffered to pH 7.4 (37°C) with Tris. PSS prepared by substituting 140 mM NaCl with 140 mM LiCl is designated as Li-PSS, and nominally Ca2+-free PSS refers to PSS in which 1 mM CaCl2 has been omitted. The cells were released from the flask by the addition of 5 mM EDTA to Ca2+-free Na-PSS, centrifuged, and resuspended twice in Na-PSS. Aliquots (300 μl) of cells were loaded for 30 min in Na-PSS containing 3 μM fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes) and 0.25 mM sulfinpyrazone (to retard transport of fura-2 out of the cells; (8.Pijuan V. Zhuang Y. Smith L. Kroupis C. Condrescu M. Aceto J.F. Reeves J.P. Smith J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1066-C1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). After loading, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 100 μl of Ca2+-free Na-PSS containing 0.3 mM EGTA and, as indicated, either 10 μM ionomycin or 200 nM thapsigargin. After 1 min, the cells were centrifuged, resuspended in the desired medium (specified in the individual experiments), and placed in a fluorescence cuvette; 0.25 mM sulfinpyrazone was included in the cuvette solutions. Occasional variations in this protocol are designated in individual experiments. All experiments were conducted at 37°C. Fluorescence was monitored at 510 nm emission with excitation at 340 and 380 nm in a Photon Technology International RF-M 2001 fluorometer. Calibration of the 340/380 ratios was accomplished by adding 10 μM digitonin to the cuvettes in the presence of excess EGTA or Ca2+ for determination of Rmin and Rmax, using the formula of Grynkiewicz et al.(10.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to calculate the corresponding values of [Ca2+]i. No differences in calibration between CK1.4 and control cells were observed. All fluorescence values were corrected for autofluorescence determined for each set of experiments using unloaded cells. For experiments involving Ba2+ entry, the excitation wavelengths were 350 and 390 nm(11.Schilling W.P. Rajan L. Stroble-Jager E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12838-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); calibrations were not conducted for the Ba2+ experiments. The results are presented for multiple experiments as mean values ± S.E. (error bars shown in figures). Significance testing was carried out using Student's t test (two-tailed) for unpaired samples. Cells were grown in 24-well plastic dishes. The medium was replaced with 1 ml of nominally Ca2+-free Na-PSS, and the cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37°C. Midway through the preincubation period, Tg (50 nM) or vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to the desired wells. The preincubation medium was replaced with the 200 μl of assay medium (either Na-PSS or NMDG-PSS, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM45CaCl2), and after the desired intervals, the wells were washed 4 times with 1 ml of termination medium (100 mM MgCl2+ 10 mM LaCl1+ 5 mM Mops/Tris, pH 7.4). The contents of the wells were extracted with 0.1 N HNO1 and counted. Ca2+ stores were depleted by treating 0.1 ml of fura-2-loaded cells for 1 min with 10 μM ionomycin in Ca2+-free Na-PSS containing 0.3 mM EGTA (37°C). The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in nominally Ca2+-free PSS (with substitutions for Na+ as indicated) containing 0.3% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin to scavenge residual ionomycin. After 30 s, 1 mM CaCl2 was added to the medium, and [Ca2+]i was monitored. After the desired interval, 3 mM EGTA and, 10 or 30 s later, 0.3 mM ATP were added to bring about Ca2+ release from the InsP1-sensitive stores(8.Pijuan V. Zhuang Y. Smith L. Kroupis C. Condrescu M. Aceto J.F. Reeves J.P. Smith J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1066-C1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peak of the Ca2+ transient was taken as a measure of the amount of Ca2+ in the InsP1-sensitive pool. Cell suspensions (0.1 ml) were loaded with fura-2 and treated with 200 nM Tg in Ca2+-free Na-PSS containing 0.3 mM EGTA for 1 min at 37°C. The cells were centrifuged and suspended in nominally Ca2+-free PSS containing 0.3 mM EGTA (with or without Na+ substitutes as indicated) in the cuvette. CaCl2 (1 mM) was added as indicated, and [Ca2+]i was monitored. Intracellular Ca2+ stores in fura-2-loaded cells were depleted by treatment with ionomycin in a Ca2+-free medium. The cells were then re-exposed to Ca2+, and the state of filling of the InsP1-sensitive Ca2+ stores was assessed after the desired intervals by the addition of 3 mM EGTA followed by 0.3 mM ATP. ATP elicits the formation of InsP1 in these cells (8.Pijuan V. Zhuang Y. Smith L. Kroupis C. Condrescu M. Aceto J.F. Reeves J.P. Smith J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1066-C1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Iredale P.A. Hill S.J. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) through its interaction with a P2U purinergic receptor(12.Iredale P.A. Hill S.J. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1(top trace, left panel) when 0.3 mM ATP was added to CK1.4 cells after pretreatment with ionomycin, no [Ca2+]i transient was observed, indicating that the InsP1-sensitive stores had been completely depleted; similar results were obtained with control cells (data not shown). In each of the other traces in Fig. 1, CaCl2 (1 mM) was added at 30 s (arrows), and then 3 mM EGTA was added after various intervals, followed by 0.3 mM ATP 30 s later. For the control cells (right panel, Fig. 1), [Ca2+]i increased markedly upon the addition of 1 mM CaCl2, and the stores refilled rapidly with Ca2+, attaining a maximal level within 2.5 min. For the CK1.4 cells (left panel, Fig. 1), the increase in [Ca2+]i upon the addition of 1 mM CaCl2 was smaller than for the control cells, and the rate of store refilling was slower, requiring 5 min of exposure to Ca2+ to achieve a maximal level. For the CK1.4 cells, the rate of store refilling was markedly increased in a Na+-free medium (Li substitution). As shown in Fig. 2(left panels), the increase in [Ca2+]i upon the addition of CaCl2 in Li-PSS was larger than in Na-PSS, and the [Ca2+]i transients elicited by ATP were markedly increased; in contrast, there was no significant difference between the sodium- and lithium-based media for the control cells (right panels, Fig. 2). The peaks of the Ca2+ transients in the CK1.4 cells after 30 and 150 s of exposure to Ca2+ were 48 ± 2 nM (n = 5) and 140 ± 13 nM (n = 3) in Na-PSS as compared with 140 ± 22 nM (n = 3) and 427 ± 83 nM (n = 5) in Li-PSS, respectively. The differences between the sodium- and lithium-based media were highly significant (p < 0.01). The comparable values for the control cells were 112 ± 31 nM (n = 5) and 327 ± 46 nM (n = 8) in Na-PSS versus 109 ± 25 nM (n = 3) and 312 ± 64 nM (n = 5) in Li-PSS. The difference between the CK1.4 cells and the control cells in Na-PSS (150 s) was significant (p < 0.01); other comparisons showed no significant differences. The larger size of the [Ca2+]i transient for the CK1.4 cells in the Na+-free medium was primarily a reflection of the increased amount of Ca2+ in the InsP1-sensitive stores. As shown below (see Fig. 8), the ATP-evoked [Ca2+]i transient in cells containing equivalent amounts of stored Ca2+ was smaller in Na-PSS than in Li-PSS, but the effect of Na+ was small compared with that shown in Fig. 2. The results in Figure 1:, Figure 2: indicate that extracellular Na+ reduces the rate of store refilling in CHO cells expressing the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger.Figure 8:Effect of Na+ on [Ca2+]i transients elicited by ATP or ionomycin. CK1.4 cells were loaded with fura-2, preincubated in 100 μl of Na-PSS + 1 mM CaCl2, and added to a cuvette containing 3 ml of Na- or Li-PSS containing 0.3 mM EGTA. At the times indicated, 0.3 mM ATP (left panel) or 2 μM ionomycin (right panel) were added to the cuvette. The data in each panel are the mean values from six to eight determinations in three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Another method of depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores is by treating the cells with Tg, an irreversible inhibitor of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases(13.Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Dr⊘bak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen M.D. Hanley M.R. Agents Actions. 1989; 27: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 14.Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cells pretreated with 200 nM Tg, ATP does not induce a [Ca2+]i transient either before or after the addition of extracellular Ca2+ (data not shown). This indicates that the InsP1-sensitive Ca2+ stores were fully depleted by the Tg treatment and that refilling of the stores does not occur, as expected from the blockade of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase activity. As in other cell types, Tg treatment increases the influx of Mn2+, a Ca2+ surrogate, as measured by the decline in fluorescence due to quenching of fura-2 by intracellular Mn2+. As shown in Fig. 3, Mn2+ entry was stimulated by Tg to the same extent in vector-transfected and CK1.4 cells, indicating that intracellular store depletion is equally effective in activating store-operated Ca2+ channels in the two types of cells. No difference was observed in the rate of Mn2+ entry between Na- and Li-PSS for either type of cell (data not shown). Mn2+ is not transported by the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in these cells (data not shown). The right panel of Fig. 4 shows that the addition of 1 mM CaCl2 to Tg-treated control cells produced a marked increase in [Ca2+]i, which was essentially identical in Na-PSS or Li-PSS. For CK1.4 cells, however (left panel, Fig. 4), the rise in [Ca2+]i was greatly reduced in Na-PSS (trace c) compared with Li-PSS (trace a). Traces b and d depict the rise in [Ca2+]i in Li-PSS and Na-PSS, respectively, for CK1.4 cells that had not been treated with Tg. For these cells, the rise in [Ca2+]i in Li-PSS (trace b) was significantly greater than in Na-PSS (trace d) but was still much less than that shown by Tg-treated cells in Li-PSS (trace a). Similar results were obtained when NMDG was used as the Na+ substitute instead of Li+ (data not shown). The average values of [Ca2+]i observed between 90 and 120 s after the addition of CaCl2 for the data shown in Fig. 4 are summarized in Table 1. Compared with the vector-transfected control cells, Tg-treated CK1.4 cells exhibited a reduced [Ca2+]i in Na-PSS but an elevated [Ca2+]i in Li-PSS (p < 0.01 in each case). The initial portions of the traces from the CK1.4 cells and control cells in Na-PSS are directly compared in the inset to the right panel of Fig. 4. The increases in [Ca2+]i are identical initially but as [Ca2+]i approaches 100 nM, the rise in [Ca2+]i slows dramatically in the CK1.4 cells; the difference between the two types of cells becomes statistically significant (p < 0.05) at all times after the asterisk shown in the inset.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A similar pattern of results was obtained in 45Ca2+ flux experiments. The data in Fig. 5 depict 45Ca2+ uptake by vector-transfected control and CK1.4 cells in Na-PSS and in Na-free PSS (NMDG substitution). 45Ca2+ accumulation under these conditions is markedly enhanced at alkaline pH, and so these experiments were conducted at an external pH of 8.0. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 5, Tg treatment (filled symbols) stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake in the control cells in both Na-PSS and in NMDG-PSS. For the CK1.4 cells, however (left panel, Fig. 5), Tg had practically no effect on 45Ca2+ uptake in Na-PSS, although in NMDG-PSS it stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake as well as in the control cells. The results in NMDG-PSS were similar to those obtained with Li-PSS (data not shown). Thus, the conclusions of the 45Ca2+ experiments are consistent with those obtained in the fura-2 measurements: Tg-induced Ca2+ entry was markedly reduced in the CK1.4 cells by the presence of extracellular Na+. In many types of cells, Ca2+ entry via the SDCI pathway is blocked by SK& 96365(15.Merritt J.E. Armstrong W.P. Benham C.D. Hallam T.J. Jacob R. Jaxa-Chamiec A. Leigh B.K. McCarthy S.A. Moores K.E. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 16.Ciardo A. Meldolesi J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 188: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in the right panel of Fig. 6, 50 μM SK& 96365 sharply reduced the rise in [Ca2+]i in vector-transfected control cells that had been treated with Tg prior to adding 1 mM CaCl2; SK& was equally effective in Na- or in Li-PSS. In contrast, SK& only partially inhibited the rise in [Ca2+]i for Tg-treated CK1.4 cells in Li-PSS (left panel). Thus, in the CK1.4 cells a substantial fraction of Ca2+ enters the cell via a pathway that is insensitive to inhibition by SK& 96365; because this pathway is absent in the control cells, it probably reflects Ca2+ influx via reverse Na+-Ca2+ exchange. Incubation of the Tg-treated cells under Na-free conditions for 5 min prior to adding CaCl2 reduced the increase in [Ca2+]i and increased its sensitivity to SK& 96365, consistent with a reduced [Na+]i and decreased contribution of Ca2+ influx via the exchanger (data not shown). Note also that the decline in [Ca2+]i after addition of EGTA was slowed by the presence of SK& 96365 (left panel, Fig. 6), consistent with previous reports of an inhibitory effect of this agent on Ca2+ efflux(16.Ciardo A. Meldolesi J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 188: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17.Cabello O.A. Schilling W.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The results presented above suggest that Na+0-dependent Ca2+ efflux via the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is responsible for the attenuation of Tg-induced Ca2+ entry in the presence of Na+. To assess the magnitude of Na+0-dependent Ca2+ efflux from CK1.4 cells, we adopted the following protocol. After loading with fura-2, [Ca2+]i was elevated by preincubating a concentrated suspension of the cells for 1 min with Li-PSS containing 200 nM Tg and 1 mM CaCl2. The cell suspension was then diluted 30-fold into a cuvette containing 0.3 mM EGTA in either Li- or Na-PSS, and the decline in [Ca2+]i was monitored. As shown in Fig. 7, the rate of decline of [Ca2+]i was more rapid in Na-PSS than in Li-PSS, consistent with a contribution of Na+-Ca2+ exchange to Ca2+ efflux. We cannot be certain that the decline in [Ca2+]i under these conditions is entirely due to Ca2+ efflux from the cell because Ca2+ sequestration by Tg-resistant compartments could also play a role. However, when control cells were used instead of the CK1.4 cells in similar experiments, there was no difference between Na- or Li-PSS, and the rate of decline in [Ca2+]i was similar to that observed in Li-PSS for the CK1.4 cells (data not shown). Thus, the Na+-dependent component of the decline in [Ca2+]i probably represents Ca2+ efflux via the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. The data in the inset of Fig. 7 depict the decline in [Ca2+]i during the first 40 s of the experiment, expressed as a first order plot. Nonlinear first order plots were observed in both Na- and Li-PSS. At equivalent concentrations of cytosolic Ca2+, the rate of decline in [Ca2+]i was approximately 2.5-fold greater in Na-PSS than in Li-PSS throughout the concentration range examined. It is important to know if the exchanger modulates Ca2+ movements elicited by physiological agonists such as ATP. Therefore, we examined the effects of Na+ on the shape of the [Ca2+]i transient elicited by ATP in CK1.4 cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 8(left panel), the peak of the [Ca2+]i transient was smaller in Na-PSS than in Li-PSS, and the transient decayed to prestimulation levels more quickly. A similar pattern was observed when a [Ca2+]i transient was evoked with 2 μM ionomycin instead of ATP (right panel, Fig. 8). With ionomycin, organellar Ca2+ sequestration would be blocked, and the decay of the [Ca2+]i transient should reflect Ca2+ efflux from the cell; the acceleration of Ca2+ efflux in Na-PSS compared with Li-PSS therefore provides an index of Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. For control cells, no difference between Na- and Li-PSS was observed in comparable experiments (cf. Fig. 9 for data with ATP). The results confirm the importance of Na+0-dependent Ca2+ efflux in regulating [Ca2+]i in the CK1.4 cells. The effects of ATP in the presence extracellular Ca2+ are compared for vector-transfected control cells and the CK1.4 cells in Fig. 9. The cuvette solutions in these experiments initially contained 0.3 mM EGTA and PSS with 140 mM NaCl, 140 mM LiCl, or 40 mM NaCl + 100 mM KCl as the principal salts. The effects of adding 0.3 mM ATP plus 1 mM CaCl2 (upper traces, Fig. 9), ATP alone (center traces, Fig. 9), or CaCl2 alone (lower traces, Fig. 9) were examined for each cell type. For the control cells (right panels, Fig. 9), the addition of ATP alone produced a transient rise in [Ca2+]i, whereas the addition of ATP + 1 mM CaCl2 elicited a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, which was higher than that evoked by the addition of Ca2+ alone. There were no major differences in the behavior of the control cells among the various media, although there was a tendency for the sustained phase of Ca2+ entry to be reduced in the 40/100 sodium/potassium medium (trace b, upper right panel, Fig. 9); the latter effect is probably due to the reduced driving force for Ca2+ entry in cells depolarized by the high potassium concentration. For the CK1.4 cells (left panel, Fig. 9), dramatic differences were observed among the different media when ATP and Ca2+ were added together. In 140 mM Na+ (trace c; upper left panel, Fig. 9), the initial [Ca2+]i transient was followed by a sustained phase that was slightly but significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared with that observed in the control cells. The levels of [Ca2+]i attained in the Na-free or 40 mM Na+ media (traces a and b; upper left panel, Fig. 9) were much higher than those produced by the addition of Ca2+ alone (lower left panel, Fig. 9) and were markedly elevated compared with the sustained [Ca2+]i levels in the vector-transfected control cells, particularly in the case of Li-PSS. Ca2+ entry was similarly enhanced when NMDG was used as the Na+ substitute (data not shown). As in the case of Tg-treated cells, the sustained increases in [Ca2+]i in the low [Na+] media were only partially inhibited by SK& 96365 (data not shown), suggesting that a portion of the Ca2+ entry under these conditions was conducted by the Na+-Ca2+ exchange system. Intracellular Ca2+ stores refilled rapidly after ATP addition (assessed by ionomycin-induced Ca2+ release; data not shown) indicating that Ca2+ sequestration was not blocked under these experimental conditions. The pronounced increase in [Ca2+]i in the low [Na+] media suggests that exchange activity might have been accelerated during the release of Ca2+ from InsP1-sensitive stores. This possibility is explored further in the experiments described below. Ba2+ is transported by the cardiac-type Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (18.Trosper T.L. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 731: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and reportedly enters several types of cells via the SDCI pathway(11.Schilling W.P. Rajan L. Stroble-Jager E. J. Biol.

Importantly, however, Ba2+ is not sequestered by intracellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or the mitochondria(20.Kwan C.-Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1981929721,"The c-myc gene encodes a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that activates transcription of cellular genes. Transcription activation by Myc proteins is regulated by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues within the transactivation domain and by complex formation with the retinoblastoma-related protein p107. In Burkitt's lymphoma, missense mutations within the c-Myc transactivation domain have been found with high frequency. It has been reported that mutant c-Myc proteins derived from Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines are resistant to inhibition by p107, thus providing a rationale for the increased oncogenic activity of these mutant c-Myc proteins. It has been suggested that these mutant c-Myc proteins resist down-modulation by p107 because they lack cyclin A-cdk2-dependent phosphorylation. Here, we have examined three different Burkitt's lymphoma mutant c-Myc proteins found in primary Burkitt's lymphomas and one mutant c-Myc protein detected in a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line. All four have an unaltered ability to activate transcription and are sensitive to inhibition of transactivation by p107. Furthermore, we provide evidence that down-modulation of c-Myc transactivation by p107 does not require phosphorylation of the c-Myc transactivation domain by cyclin A-cdk2. Our data indicate that escape from p107-induced suppression is not a general consequence of all Burkitt's lymphoma-associated c-Myc mutations, suggesting that other mechanisms exist to deregulate c-Myc function. The c-myc gene encodes a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that activates transcription of cellular genes. Transcription activation by Myc proteins is regulated by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues within the transactivation domain and by complex formation with the retinoblastoma-related protein p107. In Burkitt's lymphoma, missense mutations within the c-Myc transactivation domain have been found with high frequency.

https://openalex.org/W2061067679,"A construct comprising three tandemly repeated copies of the κB element from the interleukin-8 gene linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (3xNF-κBCAT) was transcriptionally activated in normal human FS-4 fibroblasts by co-transfection with expression vectors for NF-κB p50, p65, or p52. Unexpectedly, a significant activation of 3xNF-κBCAT was also seen upon its co-transfection with the expression vector for CCAAT box enhancer binding protein α (C/EBP-α) (but not C/EBP-β or C/EBP-ẟ). Stimulation by C/EBP-α required some other factor(s) present in FS-4 cells because no transcriptional activation of 3xNF-κBCAT was seen after co-transfection with C/EBP-α in F9 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells, known to be deficient in several transcription factors. To determine whether transcriptional activation was the result of interaction with one of the major NF-κB proteins, we co-transfected C/EBP-α with NF-κB p50, p65, p50 + p65, or p52 into F9 or FS-4 cells. No cooperative interaction was seen; in fact, C/EBP-α reduced p65-stimulated transcription, especially in F9 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a κB probe revealed that the addition of recombinant C/EBP-α protein to nuclear extracts from untreated FS-4 cells resulted in the appearance of four bands. Only one of these bands was supershifted by antibody to p50, whereas antibodies to p65 or other NF-κB proteins had no effect. Our findings show that C/EBP-α may cause activation of some κB element-containing genes lacking C/EBP binding sites.

Our findings show that C/EBP-α may cause activation of some κB element-containing genes lacking C/EBP binding sites. NF-κB proteins regulate the expression of many different genes, including genes encoding cytokines and acute phase proteins and some viral genes(1.Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 2.Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev.

The NF-κB family includes p50 (NFKB1), p52 (NFKB2), p65 (RelA), RelB, v-Rel, c-Rel and Drosophila proteins Dorsal and Dif. The N-terminal portion of NF-κB proteins contains a 300-amino acid domain termed the Rel homology region. This domain is responsible for DNA binding and dimerization of NF-κB proteins. Less homology is found within the C-terminal region of NF-κB proteins that is known to serve as the activation domain. In their inactive state NF-κB proteins are usually sequestered in the cytoplasm in a complex with an inhibitory subunit termed I-κB(1.Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). NF-κB proteins are activated by phosphorylation of the I-κB subunit and its subsequent proteasome-driven degradation leading to the release from the NF-κB•I-κB complex(4.Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). NF-κB then translocates into the nucleus and rapidly activates gene expression. Another group of transcription factors important in the regulation of cytokine and acute phase protein genes is the CCAAT box enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) ( 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBPCCAAT box enhancer binding proteinIL-8interleukin-8CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayTNFtumor necrosis factorILinterleukinTPA12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateUSFupstream stimulatory factor.) family(5.Johnson P.F.

A typical structural feature of C/EBP proteins is the presence of a domain comprising a region of basic amino acids and a leucine zipper region (b-ZIP domain)(8.Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L.

The leucine zipper domain is responsible for dimerization, causing changes in the structural conformation of the protein that allow the binding of the basic region to specific DNA sequences. The C/EBP family includes C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β (also termed IL-6 DBP or LAP; its human analogue is NF-IL6), C/EBP-γ (Ig/EBP-1), C/EBP-ẟ, and CHOP/GADD/53(7.Chen-Kiang S. Hsu W. Natkunam Y. Zhang X. Curr.

NF-κB•C/EBP-α heterodimers are formed through the interaction of the Rel homology region of NF-κB proteins with leucine zipper domains within b-ZIP regions of C/EBP transcription factors.

Ray B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7365-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 30.Diehl J.A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6635-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization between NF-κB and C/EBP proteins can lead to both cooperative and antagonistic interactions. For example, in the IL-8 promoter NF-κB and C/EBP proteins were shown to mutually augment their binding to the adjacent κB and C/EBP binding sites, resulting in increased gene expression(20.Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, C/EBP-α and C/EBP-β increased NF-κB p50- or p65-driven expression of a SAA3-CAT gene construct(31.Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was found that C/EBP can inhibit promoters with κB binding sites. Thus, when NF-κB p65 and C/EBP-β were co-transfected together with an expression vector driven solely by the κB element from the IL-8 gene, C/EBP-β inhibited p65-stimulated transcription (20.Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our present study we show that when overexpressed in human FS-4 fibroblasts, C/EBP-α activates transcription from a CAT reporter construct based on a trimeric repeat of the κB element from the enhancer region of the IL-8 gene(32.Oliveira I.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5300-5308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, C/EBP-α did not stimulate transcription of the same construct in mouse F9 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells, which fail to express endogenous NF-κB activity(33.Ten R.M. Blank V. Le Bail O. Kourilsky P. Israel A. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. III Sci. Vie. 1993; 316: 496-501PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Zabel U. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Therefore, an interaction of C/EBP-α with NF-κB and/or other transcription factor(s) is likely to be involved in the transcriptional activation of the κB-driven construct in FS-4 cells. Our studies of transcriptional activation were confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), showing that in the presence of the κB probe nuclear extracts from unstimulated FS-4 cells formed specific complexes with recombinant C/EBP-α protein.

An oligonucleotide probe composed of three copies of the NF-κB element from the IL-8 gene was used in EMSAs(32.Oliveira I.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5300-5308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human diploid FS-4 fibroblasts were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated (56°C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 6 mM Hepes, 3 mM Tricine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Cultures were seeded in 175-cm2 flasks (2 × 106 cells/flask). Undifferentiated F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. F9 cells were seeded in 60-cm2 dishes (2.0 × 106 cells/dish) coated with 0.5% gelatin (Difco). The transfection of human FS-4 fibroblasts was done by the calcium co-precipitation method with the aid of a commercial kit (5′ to 3′, Boulder, CO), using a protocol recommended by the manufacturer with minor modifications. Briefly, 1 day before the experiment, confluent cultures of FS-4 cells were trypsinized, and cells were seeded at a density of 3.5-4.0 × 106 cells/150 cm2 dish and incubated overnight at 37°C. The cultures were replenished with fresh medium and kept at 37°C for at least 4 h before transfection. The DNA-calcium precipitate containing a given amount of the appropriate plasmid DNA and 15 μg of pCMV-β plasmid encoding β-galactosidase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was added into the culture medium, and the cells were reincubated for an additional 4 h. Each construct was transfected into two 150-cm2 dishes. Four h later the cultures were glycerol-shocked and replenished with fresh medium. After 2-3 h, trypsin was added, the cells obtained from two 150-cm2 dishes were subdivided into four 60 cm2 dishes (1.8-2.0 × 106 cells/dish), and the resulting cultures were incubated overnight. This procedure eliminates differences in transfection efficiency seen when the same construct is used for transfection of separate cultures. Transfection of F9 cells was done by the calcium co-precipitation method without glycerol-shock. F9 cells were transfected when the monolayer reached 70% confluency. After overnight incubation the culture medium was replaced, and cells were incubated for additional 28 h. In some experiments the cultures were then treated with the appropriate cytokines for 5 h. Cell extracts were prepared by subjecting the cells to three cycles of freeze-thawing in 0.25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Immediately thereafter, equal amounts of protein from the extracts were used for the CAT determinations(40.Sambrook J.F. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity in the extracts was determined with the aid of a kit (Promega, Madison, WI), following instructions provided by the manufacturer. After thin layer chromatography, radioactivity was measured with the aid of the AMBIS Radioanalytic System (Ambis, Inc., San Diego, CA), and the percentage of conversion to acetylated chloramphenicol was calculated. Conversion rates were normalized to β-galactosidase activity(32.Oliveira I.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5300-5308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All transfection experiments were repeated at least five times. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared essentially as described(41.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). The binding reactions were performed with 8 μg of nuclear protein extract in 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 40-60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 12% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 30 μl at room temperature for 20 min. A total of 100 ng of the oligonucleotide used as a probe was labeled by Klenow, and 1 ng (>10,000 cpm/μg) of the radiolabeled material was used in each binding reaction. For the competition assays a 100-fold molar excess of the cold oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction and incubated for 10 min, before the addition of the probe. After gentle mixing, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature. In the “supershift” experiments 1 μl of the antibody was added to the binding reactions before the probe and poly(dI-dC) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. After the addition of both poly(dI-dC) and the probe, the reaction was gently mixed and further incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The samples were electrophoresed at 200 V (in a buffer containing 6.6 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 3.3 mM sodium acetate, pH 7.9, and 1.0 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) through a 5.5% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to Fuji RX medical x-ray film at −70°C. Scanning software Adobe Photoshop 3.0 by Adobe Systems, Inc., and Canvas 3.5.2 by Deneba Software (Miami, FL) were used for the scanning of the autoradiograms. Previous studies demonstrated that expression of the IL-8 gene is cooperatively regulated by members of two transcription factor families, NF-κB and C/EBP, which bind to two distinct, adjacent cis-acting DNA elements in the IL-8 promoter(16.Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 19.Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have examined the ability of several members of the NF-κB and C/EBP families to induce the transcriptional activation of a reporter construct comprising a trimerized NF-κB binding site from the human IL-8 gene linked to the minimal promoter of the IL-8 gene and the CAT gene (3xNF-κBCAT)(32.Oliveira I.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5300-5308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While co-transfection of FS-4 cells with 3xNF-κBCAT and the NF-κB p50 expression plasmid stimulated CAT activity less than 5-fold, co-transfection with NF-κB p65 or with both p50 and p65 increased CAT activity approximately 50-fold over control levels (Fig. 1, A and D). Transcription from the 3xNF-κBCAT construct was not activated by co-transfection with C/EBP-β and C/EBP-ẟ expression plasmids, but to our surprise, C/EBP-α produced an approximately 5-fold increase in CAT activity (Fig. 1, B and D). To determine whether activation of the 3xNF-κBCAT construct is κB sequence-specific, we also employed expression construct 3xNF-κB(HLA)CAT, comprising three copies of the κB element from the human HLA B-7 gene that differs from the IL-8 κB sequence in three positions(32.Oliveira I.C.

The 3xNF-κB(HLA)CAT construct contains the same minimal promoter from the IL-8 gene as 3xNF-κBCAT. The 3xNF-κB(HLA)CAT construct was less responsive to stimulation by the p65 expression vector than the 3xNF-κBCAT construct containing the κB sequence from the IL-8 gene (Fig. 1C). Unlike the latter construct, 3xNF-κB(HLA)CAT was not stimulated by co-transfection with the C/EBP-α expression vector, indicating that the sequence specificity of the κB element affects the activation process. To examine a possible cooperation between C/EBP-α and NF-κB proteins in the transcriptional activation of 3xNF-κBCAT seen upon overexpression of C/EBP-α, we co-transfected FS-4 cells with the reporter construct 3xNF-κBCAT and the C/EBP-α vector alone or in combination with vectors encoding different members of the NF-κB family. Transfection of different concentrations of the C/EBP-α vector alone stimulated activation of the CAT construct dose-dependently, up to approximately 8-fold (Fig. 2A). Transfection with 1 μg of the p50 (Fig. 2B) or p52 (Fig. 2C) vector alone stimulated CAT activity only modestly. Co-transfection with different amounts of C/EBP-α and 1 μg of either the p50 or the p52 expression plasmids did not have a major effect on the induction of CAT activity when compared with the results obtained by transfection of C/EBP-α alone (Fig. 2, B and C). Hence, these data did not reveal striking cooperative or antagonistic interactions between p50 or p52 NF-κB transcription factors and C/EBP-α. A possible interaction between C/EBP-α and p65 was examined by co-transfecting into FS-4 cells different doses of the p65 expression vector and a constant dose of the C/EBP-α vector along with 3xNF-κBCAT (Fig. 3). In general, the increase in CAT activity seen after co-transfection with p65 and C/EBP-α was less than the sum of CAT activities produced with either expression vector alone, suggesting some degree of antagonism between C/EBP-α and the p65 NF-κB protein. This apparent antagonism was most pronounced with 0.25 μg of the p65 expression vector.Figure 3:Effects of co-transfection with C/EBP-α and NF-κB p65 on 3xNF-κBCAT activity. FS-4 cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of the 3xNF-κBCAT reporter construct and increasing amounts of the pCMV-p65 expression vector with or without 1 μg of pMSV-C/EBP-α expression vector.

Thus, this cell line offered an opportunity to determine if C/EBP-α could produce activation of the 3xNF-κBCAT construct in the absence of functional NF-κB proteins. To confirm that F9 cells lack activable NF-κB proteins, we first transfected F9 cells with the 3xNF-κBCAT plasmid and then treated the transfected cultures with different agents known to activate gene transcription via induction of NF-κB. Neither cytokines (TNF or IL-1) nor the phorbol ester TPA induced CAT activity, confirming that F9 cells lack activable NF-κB (Fig. 4). In contrast, treatment with TNF or IL-1 caused a marked stimulation of CAT activity in FS-4 cells transfected with the same 3xNF-κBCAT reporter construct ((32.Oliveira I.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5300-5308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and data not shown). We then examined the ability of the expression vectors for C/EBP-α or NF-κB proteins p50, p52, and p65 to activate the 3xNF-κBCAT reporter construct in F9 cells. In contrast to the results obtained in FS-4 cells, C/EBP-α failed to produce any activation of CAT activity (Fig. 5, A and B). p50 or p52 alone, or combinations of C/EBP-α with p50 or p52 also failed to stimulate CAT activity. However, CAT activity was strongly stimulated in F9 cells by co-transfection with p65 (Fig. 5C). Co-transfection of p50 further potentiated the stimulatory effects of p65 on CAT activity (Fig. 5D). The stimulatory effect of p65 alone or of the combination of p65 and p50 was reduced by co-transfecting C/EBP-α, indicating an antagonistic relationship (Fig. 5, C and D).Figure 5:Activation of 3xNF-κBCAT by co-transfection of C/EBP-α and/or NF-κB proteins in F9 cells. F9 cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of the 3xNF-κBCAT reporter plasmid and various expression plasmids, as indicated. Numbers in parentheses denote μg of plasmid DNA/culture.

Overexpression of I-κB significantly inhibited the stimulation of CAT activity by p65 but had a much less marked influence on the ability of C/EBP-α to activate the 3xNF-κBCAT reporter construct.

https://openalex.org/W2134227102,"Investigations on the reduction of copper quinoprotein amine oxidases (EC 1.4.3.6) by substrate indicate that the nature of the reduced enzyme species formed varies, as judged from the spectroscopic data reported in the literature for different enzymes and substrates. The availability of substantial amounts of overproduced, homogeneous Escherichia coli amine oxidase (ECAO) enabled us to investigate this aspect with a number of different approaches: quantitative titration of enzyme with substrate, stopped-flow kinetic spectrophotometry (anaerobic and semianaerobic), EPR spectroscopy of stable intermediates in the catalytic cycle, and conversions with H2O2 as the oxidant. Reduction of ECAO by a variety of substrates led to spectra (UV/Vis, EPR) identical to those that have been ascribed to the semiquinone form of the topaquinone cofactor. The extent of semiquinone formation was enhanced in the presence of KCN, but the properties of the artificially induced semiquinone were different from those of the spontaneously induced one, as shown by the spectroscopic data and the reactivity toward O2 and H2O2. On titrating ECAO at high concentrations with substrate, evidence was obtained that disproportionation takes place of the semiquinone formed, the reaction most probably proceeding via intermolecular electron transfer, leading to a topaquinone- and Cu1+-containing enzyme species that is able to perform substrate conversion. The latter, as well as OH*, is probably also formed when H2O2 replaces O2 as oxidant, explaining why substrate conversion with concomitant enzyme inactivation occurs under this condition. Formation of the semiquinone was always preceded by that of a hitherto unknown species with an absorbance maximum at 400 nm. The structure proposed for this species is a protonated form of the aminoquinol cofactor, the Zwitter ionic structure being stabilized by amino acid residues in the active site having opposite charges. Based on the properties observed and the moment of appearance during conversions, a proposal is made for the sequence in which the three reduced enzyme species convert into each other."

Because hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, RB, is one of the key events responsible for G0/G1 phase growth arrest, we investigated whether IL-1 altered the phosphorylation status of RB protein in these cells. Exposure to IL-1 caused a time-dependent increase in hypophosphorylated RB that correlated with an accumulation of cells arrested in the G0/G1 phase. The ability of IL-1 to cause hypophosphorylation of RB and growth arrest was abrogated by the SV40 large T antigen, which binds preferentially to hypophosphorylated RB, but not by the K1 mutant of the T antigen, which is defective in binding to RB. Furthermore, the cells were protected from IL-1-inducible growth inhibition by ectopic expression of dominant-negative mutants of the Rb gene, or the transcription factor E2F-1, which is a downstream target of RB. These results suggest that hypophosphorylated RB mediates the growth arrest induced by IL-1."
https://openalex.org/W2021533421,"The potential for the activation of one Trk receptor by ligand binding to another Trk receptor was explored by determining if transphosphorylation on tyrosine residues can occur between receptors. For most of these experiments, functional chimeric receptors were used that contained the extracellular domain of the human type 2 tumor necrosis factor receptor and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of rat TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC and that, when activated by the tumor necrosis factor, mediated the nerve growth factor-like biological activities in PC12 cells. Cotransfection experiments in COS-7 cells and fibroblasts showed that despite the presence of different extracellular regions, intermolecular transphosphorylation of homologous cytoplasmic domains occurred between TrkA or TrkB and their cognate chimeras. Heterologous transphosphorylation between TrkB and TrkC kinase domains was also observed when one partner was a chimeric receptor; however, TrkA did not transphosphorylate the TrkB or TrkC kinase domains of chimeric receptors or act as a transphosphorylation substrate for these two receptors. The failure of TrkA to take part in transphosphorylation reactions with TrkB and TrkC was confirmed using the natural receptors. Trk receptor transphosphorylation occurs in the two non-neuronal cell types, but TrkA is excluded from these reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2036930695,"The nature of chromatin organization over Alu repetitive elements is of interest with respect to the maintenance of their transcriptional silencing as well as their potential to influence local chromatin structure. We previously demonstrated that the pattern of nucleosomal organization over Alu elements in native chromatin is specific and similar to the pattern observed with an in vitro reconstituted Alu template. This pattern, distinguished by a nucleosome centered over the 5′-end of the Alu element, is associated with repression of polymerase III-dependent transcription in vitro (Englander, E. W., Wolffe, A. P., and Howard, B. H.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 19565-19573; Englander, E. W., and Howard, B. H.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 10091-10096). In the current study, additional templates representing both evolutionarily old and young Alu subfamilies were found to direct a similar pattern of nucleosome assembly, consistent with the view that nucleosome positioning in vitro is shared by a majority of Alus. We discovered however, that the specific nucleosome positioning pattern was disrupted over one member of a young Alu subfamily, which recently transposed immediately downstream to a T14A11 sequence in the neurofibromatosis type 1 locus (Wallace, M.

INTRODUCTIONThe Alu class of mammalian short interspersed elements (SINEs) is the most abundant family of interspersed DNA repeats in primates. It encompasses more than 500,000 copies of a 300-bp ( 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)NF1neurofibromatosis type 1pol IIIpolymerase III.) dimeric sequence comprising 5-10% of human genomic DNA (reviewed in (1.Deininger P. Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. X. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1989: 619-636Google Scholar) and (2.Schmid C. Maraia R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1992; 2: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). Since Alu elements carry internal RNA polymerase III promoter motifs and form efficient pol III-dependent transcription templates in vitro(3.Pan J. Elder J.T. Duncan C.H. Weissman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 1151-1170PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Elder J.T. Pan J. Duncan C.H. Weissman S.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6439-6456Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a subject of continuing interest is how these elements are regulated by the host cell. This issue has been a subject of several lines of investigation, initially leading to the hypothesis that most Alu promoters are mutated and inherently weak and therefore require specialized 5′-flanking sequences for expression(6.Ullu E. Weiner A.M. Nature. 1985; 318: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7.Matera A.G. Hellmann U. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5424-5432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Chu W.M. Liu W.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1750-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). More recently it was demonstrated, however, that the normally very low level of Alu transcription in vivo can be selectively increased (i.e. relative to other pol III-transcribed genes) in response to viral infection(9.Jang K.L. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10.Jang K.L. Collins M.K.L. Latchman D.S. J. Acquired Immune Defic.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1758-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), or demethylation of internal Alu CpG dinucleotide residues(15.Liu W.-M. Maraia R.J. Rubin C.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, template availability experiments demonstrated that only a minor fraction of the transcriptional potential of Alu elements in naked genomic DNA is realized in either native chromatin or chromatin from which histone H1 was removed(16.Russanova V.R. Driscoll C.T. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Taken in combination, this evidence appears to favor the view that Alu elements are subject to one or more levels of transcriptional repression in human cells.A potentially attractive mode of gene silencing, especially for dispersed repeat elements, is packaging of transcription control regions into nucleosomes. Accordingly, the nucleosomal organization over Alu elements in vitro and in vivo has been the focus of ongoing studies in our laboratory. Analysis of nucleosome assembly in vitro over a naturally occurring Alu element that transposed into the human α-fetoprotein gene (AFP-Alu) (17.Gibbs P.E.M. Zielinski R. Boyd C. Dugaiczyk A. Biochemistry. 1986; 26: 1332-1343Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) revealed that this element directs precise rotational and translational nucleosome positioning(18.Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar translational nucleosome positioning over this Alu was demonstrated in native human chromatin, and examination of human Alu elements as a family revealed that a significant fraction of repeats is associated with rotationally positioned nucleosomes(19.Englander E.W. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10091-10096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggested that Alu elements carry inherent signals that direct nucleosomes to center over their 5′-ends, which correspond to their potential transcription start site. Moreover, assembly of a nucleosome in this position resulted in total repression of Alu promoter-mediated pol III-dependent transcription(18.Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading us to propose that the transcriptional silencing of Alu elements observed in vivo is likely to have a chromatin-mediated component. As noted above, Alu elements are not significantly derepressed by simple removal of histone H1 from chromatin(16.Russanova V.R. Driscoll C.T. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This contrasts with other pol III-transcribed genes (20.Schlissel M.S. Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 21.Carey M.F. Singh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1992; 12: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and suggests that the unusually high degree of transcriptional repression of Alu repeats may be related to their propensity to direct a non-random pattern of nucleosome assembly.To the extent that Alu elements have strong inherent signals for positioning nucleosomes, they provide a system for investigating the nature of sequence motifs that may override such signals. In this context, we considered the available experimental and theoretical data showing that homopolymeric tracts of adenine residues are not energetically favorable for wrapping around the histone core and accordingly are excluded from the central regions of nucleosomal DNA (24.Kunkel G.R. Martinson H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6869-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 25.Prunell A. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26.Satchwell S.C. Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 659-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Here, we examine a naturally occurring sequence of this type (T14A11) juxtaposed immediately 5′ to the start site of an Alu element that recently transposed into the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) locus, causing that disorder(27.Wallace M.R. Andersen L.B. Saulino A.M. Gregory P.E. Glover T.W. Collins F.S. Nature. 1991; 353: 864-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We analyzed the pattern of in vitro nucleosome assembly over this Alu element within its natural genomic context and also compared it to the pattern obtained in the context of prokaryotic DNA. It was found that the adjacent region consisting of T14A11 interferes with nucleosome assembly over the start site of the NF1-Alu. As expected, replacement of this sequence with non-homopolymeric prokaryotic DNA restored the pattern of nucleosome formation characteristic of Alu templates as well as the in vitro transcriptional repression associated with nucleosome positioning on these elements.MATERIALS AND METHODSTemplate ConstructionThe NF1-Alu clone (Fig. 1) was generously provided by Dr. M. Wallace. It comprises 794 bp corresponding to the Alu insertion and the surrounding region in the sixth intron of the NF1 gene, generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned (clone U4) into the BamHI site of the Bluescript 1(ks-) vector(27.Wallace M.R. Andersen L.B. Saulino A.M. Gregory P.E. Glover T.W. Collins F.S. Nature. 1991; 353: 864-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The BamHI fragment was subcloned into pUC21 (Boehringer & Mannheim) by digestion with StyI at position −197 relative to the Alu transcription start site and at position 387 within the vector, yielding a ~670-bp fragment-containing plasmid termed NF1-Alu. To create a template labeled uniquely at one end, a fill-in reaction with Klenow was employed with the distal-labeled end of the fragment removed by cutting with BamHI. The resulting template was a 597-bp long StyI-BamHI fragment. To generate the short ~330-bp template lacking the right monomer, the NF1-Alu was cut with HaeII and termed NF1-Alu/t.The NF1-Alu/d (Fig. 1) template was generated by digesting the NF1-Alu fragment with EaeI at position −1 relative to the Alu transcription start site and at position 297 within the vector. The ends were filled in with Klenow, and the fragment was cut with MluI at position 310 within the polylinker to generate a MluI/blunt end fragment, which was then subcloned into pUC21 cut with EcoRV and MluI. The NF1/d-Alu template was generated by cutting this construct with PvuII and EcoRI at positions 54 and 323, respectively, within the vector.The AluK/pUC19 (Fig. 1) construct was synthesized as a consensus Alu sequence of 285 bp(28.Sakamoto K. Fordis C.M. Corsico C.D. Howard T.H. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3031-3038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ~490-bp fragment used as template for nucleosome reconstitution was prepared by cutting the construct with PvuII and EcoRI within the vector. The resulting fragment consisted of ~200 bp of pUC19 DNA and ~285 bp of Alu sequence.Histone Purification and Nucleosome ReconstitutionCore histones were purified from adult chicken erythrocytes according to the described procedure(29.Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 30.Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Assembly of nucleosomes onto the end-labeled DNA fragments was by stepwise sequential dialysis from high salt and urea with purified histones(18.Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P.

Cell. 1976; 8: 333-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Reconstitution reactions were in a total volume of 180 μl. Total DNA concentration was 55 μg/ml consisting of 0.2-0.3 μg of end-labeled Alu template supplemented with carrier pUC DNA that was restricted to 0.3-0.8-kb fragments. For templates used for in vitro transcription reactions, 3.5 μg of unlabeled Alu template replaced the equivalent amount of carrier DNA in the nucleosome reconstitution reaction. DNA and histones were mixed at a ratio of 0.9 mass of histone/mass of DNA in 2 M NaCl, 3 M urea, 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The mixtures were dialyzed 12 h against the same buffer containing 5 M urea. Salt gradient dialysis was carried out by successive 80-min incubations with decreasing NaCl concentrations of 1.2, 1, 0.8, and 0.6 M and finally for 4 h at 0.6 M NaCl without urea. Dialysis was continued with two further changes over the next 16 h against 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The extent of reconstitution was monitored by gel retardation analysis of the histone-DNA complexes in 0.7% agarose gels in 0.5 × TBE.DNaseI AnalysisTo obtain DNaseI digestion, approximately 25 fmol of end-labeled templates, free or reconstituted with histone octamers/tetramers, were mixed on ice with DNaseI diluted in 5 mM CaCl2 10mM MgCl2. Assays with free DNA templates were supplemented with carrier DNA and bovine serum albumin. Following incubation for 1, 2, or 4 min, aliquots of the reaction mixtures were transferred into stop solution; the samples were then phenol:chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and resolved in a 6% sequencing gel(18.Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In Vitro TranscriptionThe NF1-Alu and the NF1/d-Alu fragments, each carrying the NF1-Alu element flanked on the 3′-end by its natural pol III termination signal, were used as templates for in vitro transcription in a free form or reconstituted with histone octamers. Nuclear transcription extract was prepared according to the described procedure(32.Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), modified by addition of a 2.5 M ammonium sulfate precipitation step. In vitro transcription reactions were assembled in a final volume of 25 μl with 100 ng of Alu template in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 42 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol. The total amount of DNA was standardized to 300 ng with » DNA. Mixtures were incubated for 20 min on ice, and transcription was initiated by addition of rNTPs: ATP, CTP, and UTP at 0.5 mM and GTP at 0.03 mM including 5 μCi of [α-32P]GTP(18.Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation at 30°C for 60 min, reactions were stopped, extracted with phenol:chloroform, and analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel electrophoresis.RESULTSTo confirm that nucleosome positioning in vitro is a general property of Alu repeats, a 285-bp synthetic consensus Alu element (AluK) (Fig. 1) inserted into a prokaryotic vector (28.Sakamoto K. Fordis C.M. Corsico C.D. Howard T.H. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3031-3038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was tested as a template for nucleosome assembly. This consensus element was designed to conform to the Alu major family sequence(33.Kariya Y. Kato K. Hayashizaki Y. Himeno S. Tarui S. Matsubara K. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which represents ~85% of Alu repeats that currently reside in human DNA. In contrast, the AFP-Alu (Fig. 1) element, whose nucleosomal assembly pattern was analyzed previously, represents a more evolutionary recent family designated precise(34.Schmid C.W. Shen C.K.J. MacIntyre R.J. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics. X. Plenum Press, New York1985: 323-358Crossref Google Scholar, 35.Jurka J. Maraia R.J. Impact of Short Interspersed Elements (SINEs) on the Host Genome. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995: 25-41Google Scholar), which comprises 10-15% of Alu elements. The NF1-Alu represents a young family that is currently transposing in the human genome. Although the consensus sequences representing the different families exhibit ~95% similarity, the individual members of the older subfamilies retain on average only ~85% sequence identity (reviewed in Refs. 2 and 35).Analysis of DNaseI footprinting patterns of the reconstituted AluK template revealed a pattern of ~10-bp periodic nicking that is characteristic of nucleosomal DNA. The pattern revealed defined rotational positioning around the start of the Alu consensus sequence (Fig. 2, arrows), consistent with nucleosome positioning observed earlier for the in vitro reconstituted AFP-Alu element within the context of its native genomic sequence(18.Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation further supports our proposal (19.Englander E.W. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10091-10096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that nucleosome positioning signals are inherent to the Alu sequence and confer the capacity to direct nucleosome positioning to a significant fraction of human Alu repeats.Figure 2:DNaseI footprinting pattern over the AluK template assembled with histone octamers. End-labeled 496-bp DNA fragment containing the Alu gene 5′-flanked by ~200 bp of pUC21 sequence was used for analyzing the top strand. Digestions were carried out with DNaseI at 0.75 μg/ml for 1, 2, and 4 min on ice. Digestion reactions for the free DNA templates were supplemented with carrier DNA and bovine serum albumin. Digestion products were resolved in 6% sequencing gel, and a photograph of an autoradiogram is shown. The end-labeled template is drawn to scale, and the structural features of the dimeric Alu element are indicated. G+A is the sequence ladder, and M is the end-labeled molecular weight marker (pBR322/MspI).

Martinson H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6869-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 36.Rhodes D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 37.Simpson R.T. Künzler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 1387-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We observed that one such sequence, a short homopolymeric tract, T14A11, occurred immediately 5′ to the recently transposed NF1-Alu and, accordingly, decided to examine its effect on the assembly of a nucleosome predicted to center over the transcription start site of the adjacent NF1-Alu element. The NF1-Alu element located centrally in a ~600-bp fragment (Fig. 1) was generated and reconstituted with purified histones by salt gradient dialysis. The disappearance of free DNA confirmed the complete association of the template with histones (Fig. 3a, lane 3). The DNaseI footprint, however, failed to generate periodic preferential nicking indicative of nucleosomal DNA (Fig. 3b); instead, the DNaseI pattern corresponding to the Alu sequence was similar for the reconstituted and the free templates. Nonetheless, a marked difference in the footprinting pattern between the reconstituted and the free DNA was detected outside of the Alu sequence, at position ~-60 relative to the transcription start site (arrow). This suggested that a nucleosome or a nucleosome-like particle that would account for the formation of the observed bandshift was associated with the proximal portion of this template. To rule out a situation in which the observed bandshift was due to a nucleosome associated with the right Alu monomer, the original template was truncated to remove its distal portion. The resulting ~330-bp fragment (NF1/t-Alu), consisting of ~170 bp of a 5′-upstream region, the left Alu monomer, and the intermonomeric linker, was reconstituted with purified histones, and its complete assembly was confirmed by gel retardation assay (Fig. 3a, lane 7). Footprinting differences between DNaseI patterns in the region corresponding to the Alu sequence or the immediately adjacent 5′-flanking sequence T14A11 were likewise absent in this case (Fig. 3c). Differences in the footprinting pattern suggesting the presence of nucleosome-associated DNA that could account for the observed bandshift were apparent only in the proximal portion of the template, i.e. upstream of position −60 (arrows). These results are in striking contrast to those observed with other Alu templates, including AluK (Fig. 2), in which the ~10-bp periodic nicking pattern is most readily seen immediately upstream of the Alu start site. Since this region is occupied by T14A11, the data suggest that this tract is responsible for exclusion of a nucleosome from its otherwise preferred position.Figure 3:Gel retardation and DNaseI footprinting analyses. a, the extent of reconstitution for end-labeled NF1-Alu-derived templates was monitored by gel retardation assay (0.7% agarose gel). NF1 is the ~600-bp parent fragment (lane 2), NF1/d is modified to eliminate the T14A11 5′-flanking sequence (lane 4), and the NF1/t (lane 6) is the parent template lacking the right monomer (see “Materials and Methods”). Reconstitutes are denoted by + and free templates by -. The marker (M) is pBR/MspI digest. DNaseI footprinting patterns are as follows: the 5′-end-labeled NF1-Alu (600 bp) (b) and the NF1/t-Alu (330 bp) (c) fragments were subjected to DNaseI digestion. The assays were carried out as described in Fig. 2. Digestion products were resolved in a 6% sequencing gel, and a photograph of an autoradiogram is shown. The landmarks of the Alu gene are indicated; in the case of the ~330-bp template, a major portion of the right monomer has been truncated. Solid bars mark the position of the T14A11 sequence, and arrows denote DNaseI cleavage sites uniquely enhanced in reconstituted templates. The M lane is PBR/MspI digest, and the products of A+G sequencing reaction are shown for sequence alignment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In view of these results, we wished to confirm the possibility that the presence of the T14A11 sequence interferes with nucleosome formation over the start of the Alu element. To accomplish this, the T14A11 tract was removed (see “Materials and Methods”). The resulting construct was used to generate a ~600-bp PvuII-EcoRI fragment termed NF1/d-Alu, carrying ~190 bp of prokaryotic sequence immediately flanking the 5′-end of the NF1-Alu element. The sequence replacing the T14A11 is comprised of ~50% G+C and has no homopolymeric tracts (not shown). Complete reconstitution of this fragment with purified histones was confirmed by the gel retardation assay (Fig. 3a, lane 5). In contrast to its parent templates, DNaseI footprinting analysis did reveal differences in the patterns on comparison of the reconstituted and free templates over the region corresponding to the proximal portion of the Alu left monomer and the flanking upstream sequence (Fig. 4, arrows). Thus, the footprinting pattern obtained with the modified template suggested that formation of nucleosomal DNA over the start site of the Alu element was dependent on the removal of the T14A11 sequence.Figure 4:DNaseI footprinting pattern for the NF1/d-Alu template. The NF1-Alu fragment was modified to eliminate the T14A11 5′-flanking sequence. The resulting NF1/d-Alu template was assembled with histone octamers and subjected to DNaseI digestion. The assay was conducted as described above, and the digestion products were analyzed in a 6% sequencing gel. A schematic structure of the Alu gene is aligned with the footprint; left and right monomers are depicted by open bars and promoter motifs by A and B. Horizontal arrows denote modifications of the footprinting pattern for the reconstituted (Rec) template.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since we previously found that an octamer centered over the start of the AFP-Alu element repressed pol III-mediated transcription(18.Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined the ability of the NF1 constructs to direct transcription. For this analysis, we used nucleosome-free and fully reconstituted templates (Fig. 3a). Control experiments demonstrated that replacement of the T14A11 sequence had no apparent effect on the ability to direct transcription by the free template (Fig. 5, a (lanes 2 and 3) and b (lane 1)). Interestingly, in these reactions it was found that while the natural NF1-Alu template was transcriptionally active when associated with histones (Fig. 5a, lanes 4-6), the NF1/d-Alu template lacking the 5′-T14A11 tract was reproducibly repressed by the assembly of nucleosomes (Fig. 5b, lanes 2 and 3). As shown in Fig. 4, the pattern of assembly in the latter case indicated that the NF1/d-Alu was associated with a histone octamer located over the transcription start site of this template. These results further confirm that the ability of an Alu element to position a nucleosome over its start site corresponds closely to its transcriptional repression when reconstituted in vitro with core histones.Figure 5:Analysis of in vitro transcription from the NF1-Alu and the NF1/d-Alu templates. The templates were assembled with histone octamers and tested for in vitro transcription. Transcription reactions were resolved in 6% sequencing gels and visualized by autoradiography. Transcription reactions were assembled in a final volume of 25 μl with HeLa nuclear extract and 100 ng of template free, or assembled with histone octamers at the ratio of 1:0.9 DNA mass/histone mass, as follows. a, the NF1-Alu template; in lanes 2 and 3, the transcript resulting from the free unlabeled template is visualized at 350 nucleotide (RNA), and in lanes 4 and 5 Alu RNA is transcribed from the reconstituted end-labeled template visualized at ~600 bp (DNA). In lane 6 is a control that confirms the integrity of the assembled template when the [α-32P]GTP is omitted from the assay. M is the pBR322/MspI digest. b, transcription from the NF1/d-Alu template; lane 1, the expected transcript (350 bp) from the naked unlabeled template (RNA). Lanes 2 and 3, no transcript is detected when the end-labeled NF1/d-Alu template (DNA) is assembled with histone octamers.
