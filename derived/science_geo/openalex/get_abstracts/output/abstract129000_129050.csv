https://openalex.org/W2043204829,"To examine the role of telomerase in normal and neoplastic growth, the telomerase RNA component (mTR) was deleted from the mouse germline. mTR−/− mice lacked detectable telomerase activity yet were viable for the six generations analyzed. Telomerase-deficient cells could be immortalized in culture, transformed by viral oncogenes, and generated tumors in nude mice following transformation. Telomeres were shown to shorten at a rate of 4.8 ± 2.4 kb per mTR−/− generation. Cells from the fourth mTR−/− generation onward possessed chromosome ends lacking detectable telomere repeats, aneuploidy, and chromosomal abnormalities, including end-to-end fusions. These results indicate that telomerase is essential for telomere length maintenance but is not required for establishment of cell lines, oncogenic transformation, or tumor formation in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2091502861,"Cohesion between sister chromatids opposes the splitting force exerted by microtubules, and loss of this cohesion is responsible for the subsequent separation of sister chromatids during anaphase. We describe three chromosmal proteins that prevent premature separation of sister chromatids in yeast. Two, Smc1p and Smc3p, are members of the SMC family, which are putative ATPases with coiled-coil domains. A third protein, which we call Scc1p, binds to chromosomes during S phase, dissociates from them at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, and is degraded by the anaphase promoting complex. Association of Scc1p with chromatin depends on Smc1p. Proteins homologous to Scc1p exist in a variety of eukaryotic organisms including humans. A common cohesion apparatus might be used by all eukaryotic cells during both mitosis and meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W1971305731,"Although previous analyses indicate that neocortical neurons originate from the cortical proliferative zone, evidence suggests that a subpopulation of neocortical interneurons originates within the subcortical telencephalon. For example, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-expressing cells migrate in vitro from the subcortical telencephalon into the neocortex. The number of GABA-expressing cells in neocortical slices is reduced by separating the neocortex from the subcortical telencephalon. Finally, mice lacking the homeodomain proteins DLX-1 and DLX-2 show no detectable cell migration from the subcortical telencephalon to the neocortex and also have few GABA-expressing cells in the neocortex."

https://openalex.org/W2091898207,"A mechanism by which members of the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)-leukemia inhibitory factor cytokine family regulate gliogenesis in the developing mammalian central nervous system was characterized. Activation of the CNTF receptor promoted differentiation of cerebral cortical precursor cells into astrocytes and inhibited differentiation of cortical precursors along a neuronal lineage. Although CNTF stimulated both the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in cortical precursor cells, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway selectively enhanced differentiation of these precursors along a glial lineage. These findings suggest that cytokine activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway may be a mechanism by which cell fate is controlled during mammalian development."
https://openalex.org/W2007853809,"Proteolysis mediated by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) triggers chromosome segregation and exit from mitosis, yet its regulation is poorly understood. The conserved Cdc20 and Cdh1 proteins were identified as limiting, substrate-specific activators of APC-dependent proteolysis. CDC20 was required for the degradation of the APC substrate Pds1 but not for that of other APC substrates, such as Clb2 and Ase1. Conversely, cdh1Δ mutants were impaired in the degradation of Ase1 and Clb2 but not in that of Pds1. Overexpression of either CDC20 or CDH1 was sufficient to induce APC-dependent proteolysis of the appropriate target in stages of the cell cycle in which substrates are normally stable."
https://openalex.org/W1963648581,"The S. cerevisiae MCD1(mitotic chromosome determinant) gene was identified in genetic screens for genes important for chromosome structure. MCD1 is essential for viability and homologs are found from yeast to humans. Analysis of the mcd1 mutant and cell cycle–dependent expression pattern of Mcd1p suggest that this protein functions in chromosome morphogenesis from S phase through mitosis. The mcd1 mutant is defective in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome condensation. The physical association between Mcd1p and Smc1p, one of the SMC family of chromosomal proteins, further suggests that Mcd1p functions directly on chromosomes. These data implicate Mcd1p as a nexus between cohesion and condensation. We present a model for mitotic chromosome structure that incorporates this previously unsuspected link."

https://openalex.org/W2075408326,"G 1 cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)–triggered degradation of the S-phase Cdk inhibitor Sic1p has been implicated in the transition from G 1 to S phase in the cell cycle of budding yeast. A multidimensional electrospray mass spectrometry technique was used to map G 1 Cdk phosphorylation sites in Sic1p both in vitro and in vivo. A Sic1p mutant lacking three Cdk phosphorylation sites did not serve as a substrate for Cdc34p-dependent ubiquitination in vitro, was stable in vivo, and blocked DNA replication. Moreover, purified phosphoSic1p was ubiquitinated in cyclin-depleted G 1 extract, indicating that a primary function of G 1 cyclins is to tag Sic1p for destruction. These data suggest a molecular model of how phosphorylation and proteolysis cooperate to bring about the G 1 /S transition in budding yeast."

Crystal structures determined for cytokine-inducible NOS ox reveal an unusual fold and heme environment for stabilization of activated oxygen intermediates key for catalysis. A winged β sheet engenders a curved α-β domain resembling a baseball catcher's mitt with heme clasped in the palm. The location of exposed hydrophobic residues and the results of mutational analysis place the dimer interface adjacent to the heme-binding pocket. Juxtaposed hydrophobic O 2 - and polar l -arginine–binding sites occupied by imidazole and aminoguanidine, respectively, provide a template for designing dual-function inhibitors and imply substrate-assisted catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W2016533302,The formation of vibrationally excited heme upon photodissociation of carbonmonoxy myoglobin and its subsequent vibrational energy relaxation was monitored by picosecond anti-Stokes resonance Raman spectroscopy. The anti-Stokes intensity of the ν 4 band showed immediate generation of vibrationally excited hemes and biphasic decay of the excited populations. The best fit to double exponentials gave time constants of 1.9 ± 0.6 and 16 ± 9 picoseconds for vibrational population decay and 3.0 ± 1.0 and 25 ± 14 picoseconds for temperature relaxation of the photolyzed heme when a Boltzmann distribution was assumed. The decay of the ν 4 anti-Stokes intensity was accompanied by narrowing and frequency upshift of the Stokes counterpart. This direct monitoring of the cooling dynamics of the heme cofactor within the globin matrix allows the characterization of the vibrational energy flow through the protein moiety and to the water bath.
https://openalex.org/W2091828531,"The site of impulse initiation is crucial for the integrative actions of mammalian central neurons, but this question is currently controversial. Some recent studies support classical evidence that the impulse always arises in the soma-axon hillock region, with back-propagation through excitable dendrites, whereas others indicate that the dendrites are sufficiently excitable to initiate impulses that propagate forward along the dendrite to the soma-axon hillock. This issue has been addressed in the olfactory mitral cell, in which excitatory synaptic input is restricted to the distal tuft of a single primary dendrite. In rat olfactory bulb slices, dual whole cell recordings were made at or near the soma and from distal sites on the primary dendrite. The results show that the impulse can be initiated in either the soma-axon hillock or in the distal primary dendrite, and that the initiation site is controlled physiologically by the excitatory synaptic inputs to the distal tuft and inhibitory synaptic inputs near the soma."

https://openalex.org/W2024348320,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (HER4) is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that is activated by neuregulins (NRG), betacellulin (BTC), and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor. Sequencing of full-length human HER4 cDNAs revealed the existence of two HER4 isoforms that differed by insertion of either 23 or 13 alternative amino acids in the extracellular juxtamembrane (JM) region. The 23-amino acid form (HER4 JM-a) and the 13-amino acid form (HER4 JM-b) were expressed in a tissue-specific manner, as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of mouse and human tissues. Both isoforms were expressed in neural tissues such as cerebellum, whereas kidney expressed HER4 JM-a only and heart HER4 JM-b only. <i>In situ</i> hybridization using specific oligonucleotides demonstrated transcription of both JM-a and JM-b isoforms in the mouse cerebellum. Tyrosine phosphorylation analysis indicated that both receptor isoforms were activated to the same extent by NRG-β1 and BTC, and to a lesser extent by NRG-α1 and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor. A functional difference was found, however, in response to phorbol ester treatment. Stimulation of cells with phorbol ester resulted in a loss of <sup>125</sup>I-NRG-β1 binding and in a reduction of total cell-associated HER4 protein in HER4 JM-a transfectants but not in HER4 JM-b transfectants. It was concluded that novel alternatively spliced isoforms of HER4 exist, that they are distributed differentially <i>in vivo</i> in mouse and human tissues, that they are both activated by HER4 ligands, and that they may represent cleavable and noncleavable forms of HER4."
https://openalex.org/W2039529043,"The decline of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) production during aging has been likened to the decrease in gonadal steroids in menopause. The repletion of GH/IGF-I levels in aging individuals is suggested to restore the lean tissue anabolism characteristic of youth. In addition to anabolic effects on musculo-skeletal tissues, GH also stimulates mammary glandular growth in some species, although its effects on primate mammary growth remain unclear. Some clinical observations implicate GH in human mammary growth, for example, gynecomastia occurs in some children treated with GH (ref. 6), and tall stature and acromegaly are associated with an increased incidence of breast cancer. To investigate the effects of GH/IGF-I augmentation on mammary tissue in a model relevant to aging humans, we treated aged female rhesus monkeys with GH, IGF-I, GH + IGF-I or saline diluent for 7 weeks. IGF-I treatment was associated with a twofold increase, GH with a three- to fourfold increase, and GH + IGF-I with a four'-to fivefold increase in mammary glandular size and epithelial proliferation index. These mitogenic effects were directly correlated with circulating GH and IGF-I levels, suggesting that either GH or its downstream effector IGF-I stimulates primate mammary epithelial proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2021120199,"An attractive approach to accelerate cheese ripening is to induce lysis of Lactococcus lactis starter strains for facilitated release of intracellular enzymes involved in flavor formation. Controlled expression of the lytic genes lytA and lytH, which encode the lysin and the holin proteins of the lactococcal bacterio-phage ΦUS3, respectively, was accomplished by application of a food-grade nisin-inducible expression system. Simultaneous production of lysin and holin is essential to obtain efficient lysis and concomitant release of intracellular enzymes as exemplified by complete release of the debittering intracellular aminopeptidase N. Production of holin alone leads to partial lysis of the host cells, whereas production of lysin alone does not cause significant lysis. Model cheese experiments in which the inducible holin-lysin overproducing strain was used showed a fourfold increase in release of L-Lactate dehydrogenase activity into the curd relative to the control strain and the holin-overproducing strain, demonstrating the suitability of the system for cheese applications."
https://openalex.org/W2022830828,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) is considered an important neuronal mechanism of learning and memory. Currently, however, there is no direct experimental link between LTP of an identified synapse and learning. A cellular analog of classical conditioning in Aplysia was used to determine whether this form of invertebrate learning involves N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA)–type LTP. The NMDA receptor-antagonist dl -2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate significantly disrupted synaptic enhancement after associative training but did not disrupt synaptic enhancement after nonassociative training. Thus, classical conditioning in Aplysia appears to be mediated, in part, by LTP due to activation of NMDA-related receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2104395802,"Inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), the dominant inositol phosphate in insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells, inhibited the serine-threonine protein phosphatases type 1, type 2A, and type 3 in a concentration-dependent manner. The activity of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels is increased in cells treated with inhibitors of serine-threonine protein phosphatases. Thus, the increased calcium channel activity obtained in the presence of InsP6 might result from the inhibition of phosphatase activity. Glucose elicited a transient increase in InsP6 concentration, which indicates that this inositol polyphosphate may modulate calcium influx over the plasma membrane and serve as a signal in the pancreatic beta cell stimulus-secretion coupling."

In this report, we show a role for hydroxyl radicals in heparan sulfate degradation and an enhanced glomerular basement membrane permeability. First, in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, exposure of coated heparan sulfate (proteoglycan) to reactive oxygen species resulted in a ±50% decrease of binding of a monoclonal antibody against heparan sulfate, whereas binding of an antibody against the core protein remained unaltered. Second, on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the molecular weight of heparan sulfate exposed to radicals was reduced which indicates depolymerization. Both in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gel electrophoresis, hydroxyl radicals are instrumental for heparan sulfate degradation as shown by the addition of various radical scavengers. Third, in an experimental model for human nephrotic syndrome (Adriamycin nephropathy in rats), glomerular basement membrane staining of two recently described anti-heparan sulfate antibodies (JM403 and KJ865) was reduced by 24 and 43%.

Identification of the radical(s) primarily involved in HS alteration was performed by the use of specific oxygen radical scavengers. To investigate the physiological significance of ROS on GBM HSPG expression and GBM permeability, we evaluated HS alterations in the nephrotic syndrome in rats after intravenous injection of ADR (doxorubicin, a member of the anthracyclin family), since in this model the generation of ROS has been shown (25Barbey M.

To study the effect of ROS on HS in vitro, ROS were generated via the hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase system and the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction according to the method described by Moseley et al. (19Moseley R. Waddington R. Evans P. Halliwell B. Embery G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this system, O2−, H2O2, and⋅OH are formed as is indicated by the following EquationsEquation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4.

HS was also exposed to HX and XO in an iron-free buffer. The ELISA was performed as described below. For PAGE, HX and XO were incubated with 20 μg of HS for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of either 625 units/ml SOD, 1 mg/ml DMTU, or 12.5 mg/ml DFO. HS was also exposed to HX and XO in an iron-free buffer. Then, the sample was boiled for 5 min to inactivate XO, centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm, and loaded on a polyacrylamide gradient gel (35Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As molecular weight markers, we used heparin-derived octasaccharides, hexasaccharides, and tetrasaccharides (obtained after deamination by nitrous acid at pH 1.5 followed by sieve chromatography; kindly provided by Dr. G. van Dedem, Diosynth, Oss, The Netherlands). The gel was run at 250 V for 18 h and subsequently stained with Alcian blue and ammoniacal silver, according to the method described by Lyon and Gallagher (35Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For ELISA and immunofluorescence (IF) (see below), we used various antibodies directed against different epitopes of HS(PG) as follows: two mAbs that recognize different epitopes in the HS chain, mouse mAb JM403 which is directed against low-sulfated domains of HS containing an N-unsubstituted glucosamine unit (8Van den Born J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22802-22809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); goat polyclonal antibody BL31 which is directed against the core protein of HSPG (33Van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Van den Born J. Van de Velden T.J.A.M. Veerkamp J.H. Monnens L.A.H. Schroder C.H. Berden J.H.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and mouse mAb 3G10 which recognizes HS stubs generated by digestion with heparitinase (32David G. Bai X.M. Van Der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van Den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). By this treatment, a terminal 4,5-unsaturated uronate residue is formed that is essential for recognition by 3G10. The staining by 3G10 can serve as a general HS marker, independent of the extent of HS modification. Fig. 1 shows schematically the general structure of an HSPG molecule and the binding sites of the four antibodies used in this study. HS (from bovine kidney; Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) was coated to a polystyrene flat-bottom microtiter plate (NUNC Maxisorp; Life Technologies, Inc., Breda, The Netherlands) in a concentration of 50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 100 μl/well, overnight at room temperature. Alternatively, HSPG, isolated from rat GBM as described earlier (31van den Born J. Jann K. Assmann K.J.M. Lindahl U. Berden J.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22802-22809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was coated 1 μg/ml in PBS, 100 μl/well, overnight at room temperature. After washing 6 times with PBS, HX and XO were added in an end volume of 100 μl/well for 2 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, the plates were washed 6 times with PBS and incubated with 1% gelatine (Difco) in PBS, 150 μl/well, for 2 h at room temperature to prevent nonspecific binding. After washing 6 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween), the wells were incubated with anti-HS side chain mAb JM403 1:50,000 or anti-HSPG core protein antibody BL31 1:2,000 in PBS/Tween, 100 μl/well, for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the wells were washed 6 times with PBS/Tween and incubated with either 100 μl of peroxidase-labeled rat anti-mouse Ig (light chain type kappa) (RM19; Central Laboratory for Blood Transfusion, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) 1:1,500 in PBS/Tween or with peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-goat Ig (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) 1:2,000 in PBS/Tween for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the wells were washed 9 times with PBS/Tween and incubated with 100 μl of tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution that was prepared immediately before use (SFRI Laboratories, Berganton, France). After 20 min, the reaction was stopped with 2 mH2SO4, and absorption was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a Bio-Rad Multiplate Reader. For all experiments, we used male Wistar-Unilever rats that were bred at our animal laboratory and weighed 150–200 g at the start of the experiments. The animals were fed standard food and tap waterad libitum. In a previous study (36Desassis J.F. Raats C.J.I. Bakker M.A.H. Van den Born J. Berden J.H.M. Nephron. 1997; 75: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we compared different doses of ADR. We found that a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight (BW) Adriamycin® (Adriablastina; Farmitalia, Milan, Italy) was optimal to induce proteinuria. To study the time course of ADR nephropathy, 40 animals were injected with 5 mg of ADR/kg BW and after either 1–5 weeks 8 rats were sacrificed, and their kidneys were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for IF. Urine and serum samples were collected every week to determine albumin and IgG concentrations. Clearance of albumin was calculated as urine albumin excretion per 24 h/serum albumin concentration, and selectivity index was calculated as clearance IgG/clearance albumin. To study the involvement of ROS in ADR nephropathy, 22 rats received an injection of 5 mg of ADR/kg BW and were treated with ROS scavengers. One group (n = 8) received an initial intraperitoneal injection of 500 mg of DMTU/kg BW dissolved immediately before use in saline 6 h before the ADR injection, followed by intraperitoneal injections of 125 mg of DMTU/kg BW twice daily (at 8.00 and 20.00 h) for 7 days, starting 6 h after ADR injection. The other 2 groups (both n = 7) received either 52,500 units of SOD/kg BW dissolved immediately before use in saline or the same volume of saline intraperitoneally twice daily (at 8.00 h and 20.00 h) for 7 days starting 6 h before ADR injection. These doses are in accordance with other studies, where they were found to be effective (26Diamond J.R. Bonventre J.V. Karnovsky M.J. Kidney Int. 1986; 29: 478-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 37Ricardo S.D. Bertram J.F. Ryan G.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 4: 1974-1986PubMed Google Scholar, 38Thakur V.

Med. 1991; 118: 427-434PubMed Google Scholar). Urine was collected every week to determine albuminuria, and 4 weeks after the ADR injection, the rats were killed and their kidneys were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for indirect IF. Urinary albumin excretion was measured in urine collected for 24 h in metabolic cages. Urine and serum concentrations of albumin were determined by rocket immunoelectrophoresis (40Laurell C.B. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 15: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar), with goat anti-rat albumin and rat albumin as a standard (both from Nordic, Tilburg, The Netherlands). Urine and serum IgG concentrations were determined by ELISA (8Van den Born J. Van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Bakker M.A.H. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J.M. Berden J.H.M. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Indirect IF was performed as described previously (11Van den Born J. Van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Bakker M.A.H.

All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide (IF buffer) and were incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Sections were incubated with mAb KJ865 diluted 1:20, followed by FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM Fc-specific (Nordic, Tilburg, The Netherlands), diluted 1:50 in IF buffer containing 4% normal rat serum. To evaluate the GBM HS staining with a mAb directed against an epitope of HS that is generated by digestion with heparitinase, non-fixed sections were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.25 units/ml heparitinase (heparin-sulfate lyase, EC 4.2.2.8, Sigma) in 50 mm HEPES and 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0. Next, the sections were incubated with mAb 3G10 diluted 1:200 in IF buffer, followed by incubation with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG2b (Southern, Birmingham, AL) diluted 1:100 in IF buffer containing 5% normal rat serum. Sections were double-stained with goat anti-human GBM HSPG core protein BL31 and mouse anti-rat GBM HS mAb JM403. Sequential incubations were performed as follows: 1) goat anti-HSPG core protein BL31, diluted 1:400; 2) FITC-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG (De Beer Medicals, Diessen, The Netherlands), diluted 1:500 in IF buffer containing 4% normal rat serum; 3) mouse anti-HS mAb JM403, diluted 1:800; 4) TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM Fc-specific (Nordic, Tilburg, The Netherlands), diluted 1:25 in IF buffer containing 4% normal rat serum. The double staining experiments included the following controls: 1) omitting BL31 or JM403 or both; 2) incubating BL31 or JM403 with the conjugate used for the detection of the other antibody in the double staining. After incubation with antibodies the sections were washed with PBS and embedded in Vectashield mounting medium H-1000 (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) and examined with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with an epi-illuminator. The staining intensities of the antibodies in the GBM were scored in 25 glomeruli on a scale between 0 and 10. No GBM staining was given a score of 0, and 10% of the GBM positive was given 1, 20% positive was given 2, etc., and all GBM loops positive were given 10. Therefore, the maximal score for the staining in each section was 250 arbitrary units (AU). The scoring was performed by two independent observers on coded sections, and the mean of the two scores was used for further analysis. As described previously the inter-observer variation is low (41Van Bruggen M.C.J. Kramers C. Walgreen B. Elema J.D. Kallenberg C.G.M. Van den Born J. Smeenk R.J.T. Assmann K.J.M. Muller S. Monestier M. Berden J.H.M. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1997; 12: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For statistical analysis, the Mann-Whitney U test and the ANOVA for repeated measurements were used for inter-group comparisons. To test correlationships, the Spearman rank correlation test was used. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. To find optimal concentrations of HX and XO, concentration ranges from 0.002 to 7.36 mm HX and from 0.01 to 50.4 milliunits/ml XO were tested on coated HS in ELISA (Fig. 2). The optimal concentrations of HX and XO were chosen such that both components alone had no effect on the ELISA signal, and the combination resulted in a maximal decrease of JM403 signal on coated HS. The optimal concentrations were 1.84 mm HX and 12.6 milliunits/ml XO, resulting in a decrease of ELISA signal of JM403 of 58 ± 6%. These concentrations (1:4 dilution in Fig. 2) were used for all further experiments. The addition of SOD to the HX and XO mixture dose-dependently prevented loss of the anti-HS signal in ELISA (Fig. 3 A). Since SOD inactivates O2−, the first oxygen radical formed in the cascade of reactions, no additional ROS (H2O2 and ·OH) will be formed. This indicates that ROS are indeed responsible for the decrease in HS recognition by mAb JM403. This experiment, however, does not answer the question which of the radicals is primarily responsible. Therefore, we also added DMTU to HX-XO. Now, O2− and H2O2 are still formed, but ⋅OH radicals are scavenged. DMTU also dose-dependently prevented loss of the anti-HS signal in ELISA (Fig. 3 B). This was corroborated by the finding that chelation of Fe3+ by DFO (Fig.3 C), thus anticipating the formation of ⋅OH radicals by the Haber-Weiss reaction, also prevented loss of the anti-HS signal. When HS was exposed to HX and XO in an iron-free buffer, the anti-HS signal remained normal as well. These data clearly indicate that primarily ⋅OH radicals are involved in HS alteration in vitro. Since various HS preparations differ in the degree of N- and/or O-sulfation and uronate C-5 epimerization, it was still uncertain whether GBM HS is also susceptible to ROS. Moreover, it is not known whether ROS can also alter the core protein of GBM HSPG. For that reason, ELISA experiments were repeated with HSPG isolated from rat GBM. We used anti-HS mAb JM403 to evaluate the effect of ROS on the HS polysaccharide side chain and a polyclonal antibody (BL31) against the core protein to assess ROS-mediated damage to the core protein. Incubation with HX and XO also resulted in a decreased JM403 signal on rat GBM HSPG. This decrease could also be prevented dose-dependently by adding SOD, DMTU, and DFO to HX-XO (Fig. 3, D–F) and by incubating HX and XO in an iron-free buffer. Oxygen radicals had no effect, however, on the recognition of the HSPG core protein by BL31 (Fig. 3, D–F). These data indicate that ⋅OH radicals are responsible for the decrease of anti-HS binding to GBM HSPG. Theoretically, two different mechanisms might explain this finding. First, ⋅OH radicals alter the biochemical composition of HS, thereby changing the epitopes recognized by mAb JM403. Second,⋅OH radicals depolymerize HS chains into oligosaccharides. Therefore, we evaluated the molecular size of native and ROS-exposed HS (from bovine kidney) on PAGE. In addition, HS was exposed to ROS in the presence of various scavengers. On PAGE, native HS forms a band in the top of the gel (Fig. 4, lanes 4). After incubation with 1.84 mm HX and 12.6 milliunits/ml XO, this pattern changes to a smear down to the level of the octasaccharides, indicating depolymerization of HS (lane 7). Adding either DMTU, SOD, or DFO to HX-XO or incubating HX-XO in an iron-free buffer preven"
https://openalex.org/W1964682134,"We have isolated and characterized a novel member (CAT3) of the cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) family. In oocyte injection assays, CAT3 cRNA exhibited a saturable, sodium ion-independent transport activity with high affinity forl-arginine and l-lysine (K m = 40–60 and 115–165 μm, respectively). Transport of l-arginine was effectively competed only by cationic amino acids in l-form: arginine, lysine, ornithine, and 2,4-diamino-n-butyric acid but not by 2,3-diaminopropionic acid. The presence of l-arginine in the incubation medium stimulated the efflux rate ofl-arginine, indicating that CAT3 is subject to trans-stimulation. All these results are consistent with the idea that CAT3, along with CAT1 and CAT2, constitutes the transport activity originally assigned to system y+. Like CAT2, but unlike CAT1, the expression of CAT3 is regulated in a highly tissue-specific manner; when various adult tissues were examined, significant levels of CAT3 transcript were detectable only in brain. In situhybridization on brain sections revealed that CAT3 transcripts were localized predominantly along the midbrain-thalamus-hypothalamus axis, whereas neither CAT1 nor CAT2 transcripts demonstrated a similar localization. In contrast to its highly localized expression during the primitive streak stage and in the adult stage, CAT3 expression was detected more widely in 13.5 day post-coitum mouse embryos.

Before the first report of molecular characterization of an amino acid transporter in 1991 (1Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 2Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. North R.A. Kavat D. Nature. 1991; 352: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), amino acid transport activities were physiologically characterized and categorized according to the specificity, affinity, and capacity for the substrates and the dependence on particular ions (3Christensen H.N. Avery J. Membrane Structure and Mechanisms of Biological Energy Transductions. Plenum Press, London1973: 233-263Google Scholar, 4Christensen H.N. Biochim. Biophys.

In a wide variety of tissues, cationic amino acids are transported across the plasma membrane by an activity termed “system y+.” System y+ is a saturable, sodium ion-independent transport activity with high specificity and affinity for cationic l-amino acids (5White M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 355-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). System y+ mediates transport of the substrates across the membrane in both directions and is stimulated by the presence of substrates in the opposite side of the membrane (trans-stimulation) (6White M.F. Gazzola G.C. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4443-4449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A low affinity and high capacity transport activity with no significant degree of trans-stimulation, but otherwise identical to system y+, was detected in liver, where system y+ was barely detectable (7White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4450-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Distinct transport activities with broad substrate specificities that include some of the neutral amino acids as well as cationic amino acids have also been reported. For example, system b0,+ and system B0,+, originally detected in mouse blastocysts (8Van Winkle L.J. Campione A.L. Gorman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3150-3163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transport in sodium ion-independent and sodium ion-dependent manners, respectively, both cationic amino acids and neutral amino acids. System y+L in erythrocyte and in placenta exhibits sodium ion-independent uptake of cationic amino acids and sodium ion-dependent uptake of neutral amino acids (9Deves R. Chavez P. Boyd A.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 454: 491-501Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Eleno N. Deves R. Boyd C.A.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 479: 291-300Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar activities have been reported for intestine and kidney as well.The first amino acid transporter gene to be cloned and characterized (1Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M.

CAT1 is widely expressed, and the protein product exhibits the characteristics originally assigned to system y+. A subsequently identified cationic amino acid transporter gene, CAT2, shares high sequence homology with CAT1. However, the transcript encoding CAT2 protein is subject to differential tissue-specific splicing, resulting in two distinct proteins, CAT2 and CAT2a. 2We adapted the terminology of the CAT2 proposed by Malandro and Kilberg (13Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). 2We adapted the terminology of the CAT2 proposed by Malandro and Kilberg (13Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). CAT2 is detectable in activated lymphocytes as well as several other tissues and exhibits the same characteristics assigned to system y+ (11Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20796-20800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAT2a is highly specific to liver, with low affinity and high capacity for the cationic amino acid substrates, and does not exhibit significant trans-stimulation; thus CAT2a is likely identical to the activity described previously in liver (12Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Kim J.W. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7538-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These three proteins compose the CAT family of cationic amino acid transporters (reviewed in Ref. 13Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Members of the CAT family share high sequence homology, each containing 12–14 putative transmembrane domains. Members of the rBAT/4F2hc family of transmembrane proteins (reviewed in Ref. 13Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) contain only one or four putative transmembrane domains and exhibit system b0,+-like or system y+l-like activities when expressed inXenopus oocytes (14Chillaron J. Estevez R. Mora C. Wagner C.A. Suessbrich H. Lang F. Gelpi J.L. Testar X. Busch A.E. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17761-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Members of this family possess less strict substrate specificity than the CAT family members and exhibit substrate-dependent preference in the direction of transport (14Chillaron J. Estevez R. Mora C. Wagner C.A. Suessbrich H. Lang F. Gelpi J.L. Testar X. Busch A.E. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17761-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).The present study reports the fourth member of the CAT family, which in the adult mouse is expressed primarily in brain. In primitive streak stage mouse embryos, CAT3 transcripts are detectable only in embryonic mesoderm. CAT3 protein also exhibits the characteristics of system y+, indicating that the activity described as system y+ is composed of products of multiple genes.After the submission of our sequence to GenBankTM and during the preparation of this manuscript, another report of a rat homolog of CAT3 appeared (15Hosokawa H. Sawamura T. Kobayashi S. Ninomiya H. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8717-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific expression patterns of both CAT3 genes appear to be highly conserved between the species, suggesting functional importance of CAT3 protein in brain.DISCUSSIONAn attempt to isolate mouse embryonic germ layer-specific transcripts resulted in the isolation of a cationic amino acid transporter gene CAT3. When injected into Xenopus oocytes, CAT3 cRNA exhibited a saturable, sodium ion-independent transport activity with high affinity and specificity for cationicl-amino acids. The CAT3 cRNA-stimulated activity was also subject to a mild degree of trans-stimulation. DAB appears to be the smallest cationic amino acid that CAT3 can transport with ease, since DAP could not effectively inhibit transport of l-arginine, whereas DAB could. All of these characteristics were consistent with the cationic amino acid transport activity termed system y+. Another characteristic of system y+ is a mild sodium ion-dependent inhibition of the transport activity by neutral amino acids; for example, byl-homoserine, when assayed in cultured cells (6White M.F.

In our oocyte injection assays, however, no sodium ion-dependent inhibition by l-homoserine or by other neutrall-amino acids of the transport activity of CAT3 was observed. Failure in inhibiting the transport activity in sodium ion-dependent manner by neutral l-amino acids in Xenopus oocytes was also reported for CAT1 (1Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M.

Although the lack of sodium ion-dependent inhibition by neutral l-amino acids may lead to an argument that CAT1 does not truly represent the activity assigned to system y+, the apparent inconsistency may originate from the use of Xenopus oocytes instead of cultured cells. For example, it is possible that some properties of the transport activity may be altered by interactions between CAT proteins and other factors that are absent from Xenopus oocytes. A system y+-like activity, which was characterized by sodium ion-independent transport of cationic l-amino acids and sodium ion-dependent inhibition of the activity by neutrall-amino acids in Xenopus oocytes, was described for the 4F2hc protein (26Bertran J. Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Kuhn L.C. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5606-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Members of the rBAT/4F2hc family exhibit broader, less strict substrate specificity and asymmetric exchange of cationic and neutral amino acids in oocytes (14Chillaron J. Estevez R. Mora C.

Interactions with other proteins is likely essential for rBAT/4F2hc family of transporter proteins, which possess only one or four putative transmembrane domains (Refs. 26Bertran J. Magagnin S.

It has been suggested that members of rBAT/4F2hc family function as accessory proteins in multi-subunit transporter complexes (26Bertran J. Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X.

Thus, interaction or lack of interaction with other factors might be responsible for the discrete effects of various amino acids on the transport activity of CAT3 and on the native transport activity of oocytes as well.It appears that system y+, the principal cationicl-amino acid transporter (30White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10069-10080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is composed of multiple constituents. One question regarding the physiological role of CAT3 is why the gene is required in particular tissues where CAT1 or CAT2 might be expected to suffice. As described above, other than the clearly distinct K m values between the two substrates and the low degree of trans-stimulation, CAT3 did not appear to differ in function very much from CAT1 or CAT2, at least in the oocyte injection assays. However, the molecular mechanism of cationic amino acid transport is still unknown, and future studies may reveal important differences among CAT family members, such as association with other factors.A major difference among CAT1, CAT2, and CAT3 might be their responsiveness to various types of signals. In rat vascular muscle cells, angiotensin II stimulated both CAT1 and CAT2 mRNA expression (31Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27577-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor α stimulated CAT2 but not CAT1 expression (32Gill D.J.

In cardiac myocytes, interleukin 1β and interferon γ co-induced CAT1, CAT2, and CAT2a, whereas insulin increased only CAT1 levels (34Simmons W.W. Closs E.L. Cunningham J.M. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J.

Various signals that cause transition of cells from the resting state to the proliferating state appear to activate CAT1 expression (35Yoshimoto T. Yoshimoto E. Meruelo D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4377-4381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wu J.Y. Robinson D. Kung H.-J. Hatzoglou M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Aulak K.S. Liu J. Wu J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29799-29806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), translational, or post-translational level. Potential targets for CAT1 and CAT2 regulation include the long 3′-untranslated regions in the mRNAs and N-linked glycosylation sites in the protein, which have been implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability (38Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and membrane trafficking (39Nguyen T.T. Amara S.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,40Melikian H.E. Ramamoorthy S. Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 266-276PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. CAT3 differs from the other family members in that its mRNA does not contain a particularly long 3′-untranslated region, and the protein is missing one particular potentialN-linked glycosylation site. Of particular interest, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter Glut4 contains a singleN-glycosylation site, and the effects ofN-glycosylation of this transporter have been shown to be cell-type specific (41Ing B.L. Chen H. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Quan M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, at least in Xenopusoocytes, removal of the N-glycosylation sites from CAT1 by amino acid substitution did not change the transport activity of the protein (25Kim J.W. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16316-16320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the tissue-specific expression of CAT3, as well as CAT2, may reflect important differential responses of the proteins to changes in physiological conditions, as exemplified by the glucose transporter Glut-4, which, upon stimulation by insulin, translocates from an intracellular site to the plasma membrane.The distinct distribution patterns detected for transcripts of CAT family members in mouse brain suggest potentially different roles played by these transporters. In this context, the induced nitric oxide synthesis observed in brain astrocytes was reported to be partly dependent on induction of CAT2 (20Stevens B.R. Kakuda D.K. Yu K. Waters M. Vo C.B. Raizada M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24017-24022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that cationic amino acid transport activity across the blood-brain barrier had the kinetic properties of system y+ and that CAT1 mRNA was 38-fold enriched in microvessels as compared with wholebrain (42Stoll J. Wadhwani K.C. Smith Q.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1956-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).The significance of the highly localized distribution of CAT3 transcripts within adult mouse brain or in early stage mouse embryos is not yet clear. In addition, we do not know whether the mRNA distribution actually corresponds to the presence of CAT3 protein at the membrane. However, the embryonic and adult patterns of CAT3 reported here provide a framework for further investigations regarding CAT3 function.This study, along with studies on CAT2, has suggested that the activity originally assigned to system y+ is actually composed of products of multiple genes with distinct tissue distributions. As more cationic amino acid transporter genes are isolated, additional members of the CAT family may be discovered, some of which may exhibit the activity described as system y+. The disagreements observed between system y+ and CAT1 or CAT3 may be solved by isolation of new transporters or by isolation of associating factors that confer different characteristics to the transporters. Before the first report of molecular characterization of an amino acid transporter in 1991 (1Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 2Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. North R.A. Kavat D. Nature. 1991; 352: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), amino acid transport activities were physiologically characterized and categorized according to the specificity, affinity, and capacity for the substrates and the dependence on particular ions (3Christensen H.N. Avery J. Membrane Structure and Mechanisms of Biological Energy Transductions. Plenum Press, London1973: 233-263Google Scholar, 4Christensen H.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 43Christensen H.N. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1975; 6: 227-258Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In a wide variety of tissues, cationic amino acids are transported across the plasma membrane by an activity termed “system y+.” System y+ is a saturable, sodium ion-independent transport activity with high specificity and affinity for cationic l-amino acids (5White M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 355-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). System y+ mediates transport of the substrates across the membrane in both directions and is stimulated by the presence of substrates in the opposite side of the membrane (trans-stimulation) (6White M.F. Gazzola G.C. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4443-4449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A low affinity and high capacity transport activity with no significant degree of trans-stimulation, but otherwise identical to system y+, was detected in liver, where system y+ was barely detectable (7White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4450-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Distinct transport activities with broad substrate specificities that include some of the neutral amino acids as well as cationic amino acids have also been reported. For example, system b0,+ and system B0,+, originally detected in mouse blastocysts (8Van Winkle L.J. Campione A.L. Gorman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3150-3163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transport in sodium ion-independent and sodium ion-dependent manners, respectively, both cationic amino acids and neutral amino acids. System y+L in erythrocyte and in placenta exhibits sodium ion-independent uptake of cationic amino acids and sodium ion-dependent uptake of neutral amino acids (9Deves R. Chavez P. Boyd A.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 454: 491-501Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Eleno N. Deves R. Boyd C.A.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 479: 291-300Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar activities have been reported for intestine and kidney as well. The first amino acid transporter gene to be cloned and characterized (1Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 2Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. North R.A. Kavat D. Nature. 1991; 352: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) was a mouse cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) 1The abbreviations used are: CAT, cationic amino acid transporter; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; DAB, l-2,4-diamino-n-butyric acid; DAP, l-2,3-diamino propionic acid; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: CAT, cationic amino acid transporter; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; DAB, l-2,4-diamino-n-butyric acid; DAP, l-2,3-diamino propionic acid; bp, base pair(s). gene CAT1. CAT1 is widely expressed, and the protein product exhibits the characteristics originally assigned to system y+. A subsequently identified cationic amino acid transporter gene, CAT2, shares high sequence homology with CAT1. However, the transcript encoding CAT2 protein is subject to differential tissue-specific splicing, resulting in two distinct proteins, CAT2 and CAT2a. 2We adapted the terminology of the CAT2 proposed by Malandro and Kilberg (13Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). 2We adapted the terminology of the CAT2 proposed by Malandro and Kilberg (13Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). CAT2 is detectable in activated lymphocytes as well as several other tissues and exhibits the same characteristics assigned to system y+ (11Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20796-20800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAT2a is highly specific to liver, with low affinity and high capacity for the cationic amino acid substrates, and does not exhibit significant trans-stimulation; thus CAT2a is likely identical to the activity described previously in liver (12Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Kim J.W. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7538-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These three proteins compose the CAT family of cationic amino acid transporters (reviewed in Ref. 13Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Members of the CAT family share high sequence homology, each containing 12–14 putative transmembrane domains. Members of the rBAT/4F2hc family of transmembrane proteins (reviewed in Ref. 13Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) contain only one or four putative transmembrane domains and exhibit system b0,+-like or system y+l-like activities when expressed inXenopus oocytes (14Chillaron J. Estevez R. Mora C. Wagner C.A. Suessbrich H. Lang F. Gelpi J.L. Testar X. Busch A.E. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17761-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Members of this family possess less strict substrate specificity than the CAT family members and exhibit substrate-dependent preference in the direction of transport (14Chillaron J. Estevez R. Mora C. Wagner C.A. Suessbrich H. Lang F. Gelpi J.L. Testar X. Busch A.E. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17761-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The present study reports the fourth member of the CAT family, which in the adult mouse is expressed primarily in brain. In primitive streak stage mouse embryos, CAT3 transcripts are detectable only in embryonic mesoderm. CAT3 protein also exhibits the characteristics of system y+, indicating that the activity described as system y+ is composed of products of multiple genes. After the submission of our sequence to GenBankTM and during the preparation of this manuscript, another report of a rat homolog of CAT3 appeared (15Hosokawa H. Sawamura T. Kobayashi S. Ninomiya H. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8717-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific expression patterns of both CAT3 genes appear to be highly conserved between the species, suggesting functional importance of CAT3 protein in brain. DISCUSSIONAn attempt to isolate mouse embryonic germ layer-specific transcripts resulted in the isolation of a cationic amino acid transporter gene CAT3. When injected into Xenopus oocytes, CAT3 cRNA exhibited a saturable, sodium ion-independent transport activity with high affinity and specificity for cationicl-amino acids. The CAT3 cRNA-stimulated activity was also subject to a mild degree of trans-stimulation. DAB appears to be the smallest cationic amino acid that CAT3 can transport with ease, since DAP could not effectively inhibit transport of l-arginine, whereas DAB could. All of these characteristics were consistent with the cationic amino acid transport activity termed system y+. Another characteristic of system y+ is a mild sodium ion-dependent inhibition of the transport activity by neutral amino acids; for example, byl-homoserine, when assayed in cultured cells (6White M.F. Gazzola G.C. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4443-4449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our oocyte injection assays, however, no sodium ion-dependent inhibition by l-homoserine or by other neutrall-amino acids of the transport activity of CAT3 was observed. Failure in inhibiting the transport activity in sodium ion-dependent manner by neutral l-amino acids in Xenopus oocytes was also reported for CAT1 (1Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M.

For example, it is possible that some properties of the transport activity may be altered by interactions between CAT proteins and other factors that are absent from Xenopus oocytes. A system y+-like activity, which was characterized by sodium ion-independent transport of cationic l-amino acids and sodium ion-dependent inhibition of the activity by neutrall-amino acids in Xenopus oocytes, was described for the 4F2hc protein (26Bertran J.

Of particular interest, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter Glut4 contains a singleN-glycosylation site, and the effects ofN-glycosylation of this transporter have been shown to be cell-type specific (41Ing B.L. Chen H. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Quan M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, at least in Xenopusoocytes, removal of the N-glycosylation sites from CAT1 by amino acid substitution did not change the transport activity of the protein (25Kim J.W. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16316-16320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the tissue-specific expression of CAT3, as well as CAT2, may reflect important differential responses of the proteins to changes in physiological conditions, as exemplified by the glucose transporter Glut-4, which, upon stimulation by insulin, translocates from an intracellular site to the plasma membrane.The distinct distribution patterns detected for transcripts of CAT family members in mouse brain suggest potentially different roles played by these transporters. In this context, the induced nitric oxide synthesis observed in brain astrocytes was reported to be partly dependent on induction of CAT2 (20Stevens B.R. Kakuda D.K. Yu K. Waters M. Vo C.B. Raizada M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24017-24022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that cationic amino acid transport activity across the blood-brain barrier had the kinetic properties of system y+ and that CAT1 mRNA was 38-fold enriched in microvessels as compared with wholebrain (42Stoll J. Wadhwani K.C. Smith Q.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1956-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).The significance of the highly localized distribution of CAT3 transcripts within adult mouse brain or in early stage mouse embryos is not yet clear. In addition, we do not know whether the mRNA distribution actually corresponds to the presence of CAT3 protein at the membrane. However, the embryonic and adult patterns of CAT3 reported here provide a framework for further investigations regarding CAT3 function.This study, along with studies on CAT2, has suggested that the activity originally assigned to system y+ is actually composed of products of multiple genes with distinct tissue distributions. As more cationic amino acid transporter genes are isolated, additional members of the CAT family may be discovered, some of which may exhibit the activity described as system y+. The disagreements observed between system y+ and CAT1 or CAT3 may be solved by isolation of new transporters or by isolation of associating factors that confer different characteristics to the transporters. An attempt to isolate mouse embryonic germ layer-specific transcripts resulted in the isolation of a cationic amino acid transporter gene CAT3. When injected into Xenopus oocytes, CAT3 cRNA exhibited a saturable, sodium ion-independent transport activity with high affinity and specificity for cationicl-amino acids. The CAT3 cRNA-stimulated activity was also subject to a mild degree of trans-stimulation. DAB appears to be the smallest cationic amino acid that CAT3 can transport with ease, since DAP could not effectively inhibit transport of l-arginine, whereas DAB could. All of these characteristics were consistent with the cationic amino acid transport activity termed system y+. Another characteristic of system y+ is a mild sodium ion-dependent inhibition of the transport activity by neutral amino acids; for example, byl-homoserine, when assayed in cultured cells (6White M.F. Gazzola G.C. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4443-4449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our oocyte injection assays, however, no sodium ion-dependent inhibition by l-homoserine or by other neutrall-amino acids of the transport activity of CAT3 was observed. Failure in inhibiting the transport activity in sodium ion-dependent manner by neutral l-amino acids in Xenopus oocytes was also reported for CAT1 (1Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), whose transport actvity is now widely accepted as representing the activity assigned to system y+. Although the lack of sodium ion-dependent inhibition by neutral l-amino acids may lead to an argument that CAT1 does not truly represent the activity assigned to system y+, the apparent inconsistency may originate from the use of Xenopus oocytes instead of cultured cells. For example, it is possible that some properties of the transport activity may be altered by interactions between CAT proteins and other factors that are absent from Xenopus oocytes. A system y+-like activity, which was characterized by sodium ion-independent transport of cationic l-amino acids and sodium ion-dependent inhibition of the activity by neutrall-amino acids in Xenopus oocytes, was described for the 4F2hc protein (26Bertran J. Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Kuhn L.C. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5606-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Members of the rBAT/4F2hc family exhibit broader, less strict substrate specificity and asymmetric exchange of cationic and neutral amino acids in oocytes (14Chillaron J. Estevez R. Mora C. Wagner C.A. Suessbrich H. Lang F. Gelpi J.L. Testar X. Busch A.E. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17761-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Interactions with other proteins is likely essential for rBAT/4F2hc family of transporter proteins, which possess only one or four putative transmembrane domains (Refs. 26Bertran J. Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Kuhn L.C. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5606-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Wells R.G.

Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5601-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref.13). It has been suggested that members of rBAT/4F2hc family function as accessory proteins in multi-subunit transporter complexes (26Bertran J. Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Kuhn L.C. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5606-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8482-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, interaction or lack of interaction with other factors might be responsible for the discrete effects of various amino acids on the transport activity of CAT3 and on the native transport activity of oocytes as well. It appears that system y+, the principal cationicl-amino acid transporter (30White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10069-10080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is composed of multiple constituents. One question regarding the physiological role of CAT3 is why the gene is required in particular tissues where CAT1 or CAT2 might be expected to suffice. As described above, other than the clearly distinct K m values between the two substrates and the low degree of trans-stimulation, CAT3 did not appear to differ in function very much from CAT1 or CAT2, at least in the oocyte injection assays. However, the molecular mechanism of cationic amino acid transport is still unknown, and future studies may reveal important differences among CAT family members, such as association with other factors. A major difference among CAT1, CAT2, and CAT3 might be their responsiveness to various types of signals. In rat vascular muscle cells, angiotensin II stimulated both CAT1 and CAT2 mRNA expression (31Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27577-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor α stimulated CAT2 but not CAT1 expression (32Gill D.J. Low B.C. Grigor M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11280-11283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived growth factor treatment of smooth muscle cells strongly induced CAT2 mRNA expression but only moderately induced CAT1 mRNA expression (33Durante W. Liao L. Iftikhar I. Cheng K. Schafer A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11838-11843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, interleukin 1β and interferon γ co-induced CAT1, CAT2, and CAT2a, whereas insulin increased only CAT1 levels (34Simmons W.W. Closs E.L. Cunningham J.M. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11694-11702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In resting myocytes, only CAT1 was expressed (34Simmons W.W. Closs E.L. Cunningham J.M.

Various signals that cause transition of cells from the resting state to the proliferating state appear to activate CAT1 expression (35Yoshimoto T. Yoshimoto E. Meruelo D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4377-4381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wu J.Y. Robinson D. Kung H.-J. Hatzoglou M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Aulak K.S. Liu J. Wu J.

The regulation of CAT family genes could be at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional (37Aulak K.S. Liu J. Wu J. Hyatt S.L. Puppi M. Henning S.J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29799-29806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), translational, or post-translational level. Potential targets for CAT1 and CAT2 regulation include the long 3′-untranslated regions in the mRNAs and N-linked glycosylation sites in the protein, which have been implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability (38Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and membrane trafficking (39Nguyen T.T. Amara S.G. J.

Of particular interest, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter Glut4 contains a singleN-glycosylation site, and the effects ofN-glycosylation of this transporter have been shown to be cell-type specific (41Ing B.L.

However, at least in Xenopusoocytes, removal of the N-glycosylation sites from CAT1 by amino acid substitution did not change the transport activity of the protein (25Kim J.W. Cunningham J.M. J.

It is possible that the tissue-specific expression of CAT3, as well as CAT2, may reflect important differential responses of the proteins to changes in physiological conditions, as exemplified by the glucose transporter Glut-4, which, upon stimulation by insulin, translocates from an intracellular site to the plasma membrane.

The vacuolar proton-translocating ATPases are a family of organellar proton pumps found throughout the endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells.

The enzymes of both families have similar subunit stoichiometries (1Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), similar structures based on electron micrographic imaging (2Bowman B.J. Dschida W.J. Harris T. Bowman E.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the major catalytic subunits (A and B in the V-type; β and α in the F-type) show primary sequence homology of about 30%, whereas the principal proton-translocating subunits, the c subunits or proteolipids, also show high sequence homology (5Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 6Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Dittrich P. Taiz L.

The intermediate peripheral sector subunits and the remaining integral sector subunits show little or no homology between the two families. This suggests an overall conservation of gross structure with a low tolerance for deviation at the sites mediating the two principal activities: ATP hydrolysis (or synthesis) and proton translocation. In contrast, the intermediate subunits that couple these activities have greater evolutionary flexibility. The subunits coupling the F1 peripheral sector to the FO membrane sector, γ, δ, ε, and the hydrophilic portion of FO-b, are described as “core” or “stalk” subunits because they reside in the midst of the catalytic subunits and appear to bridge physically the two sectors as seen in electron micrographic images. The subunits presumably bridging the V1 and V0 sectors, C (Vma5p), D (Vma8p), E (Vma4p), F (Vma7p), G (Vma10p), H (Vma13p), d (Vma6p), and perhaps hydrophilic portions of Vph1p, can therefore also be thought of as stalk or core subunits of the V-ATPase. We have identified a hierarchy of V1 subcomplexes which assemble in the cytoplasm of yeast strains deleted for individual subunits (Tables I andII; Ref. 8Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Significant among these subcomplexes is complex II (A3B3DEFG), the soluble cytosolic form of the V1 complex. Smaller subcomplexes assemble to form complex II when combined in vitro, indicating they are bona fide intermediates of assembly (9Tomashek J.J. Garrison B.S. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16618-16623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we further analyze subunits Vma7p (F) and Vma10p (G), which were not extensively examined previously. These subunits are intriguing because they seem to associate with both the V1 and V0 sectors. Vma7p is required for assembly of V0, although it otherwise behaves as a V1subunit (10Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vma10p was originally reported as an hydrophilic subunit tightly associated with the V0 (11Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), similar to Vma6p (12Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Vma10p behaves predominantly as a canonical V1 subunit. Nonetheless, Vma10p also has homology to the hydrophilic portion of the FO-b subunit, suggesting it may be in close association with V0 subunits within the holoenzyme (13Supekova L. Sbia M. Supek F.

Yeast haploid strain, SF838-1D (Matα ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 his4-519 ade6 pep4-3), was transformed using the lithium acetate method with the PCR-generatedvma10Δ::LEU2 disruption fragment (17Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate strain LGY14. Disruption was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for Vma10p. All antibodies except those to Vma7p and Vma10p have been described previously. For Vma7p, two oligonucleotides, 5′-CTAAATCAGATCTGAGAAACGTACTCTTCTTATAGC-3′ and 5′-GTTTTGGTCTAGAGAATTCGCTTACTCACC-3′, were used in PCR to generate a 384-bp fragment including the entire VMA7 ORF minus the initial methionine and introducing a 5′ BglII restriction site and a 3′ XbaI site (underlined) that were used to subclone the fragment into BamHI- andXbaI-digested pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs) to generate pLG27. Escherichia coli cells carrying the plasmid were induced for protein expression by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. A 56-kDa maltose-binding protein-Vma7p fusion protein was isolated from E. coli cell extracts using amylose resin according to the provided protocol and used to inject New Zealand White rabbits. For Vma10p, two oligonucleotides, 5′-GGAAGATCTTCCCAAAAAAACGGAATTGCC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAGAATTCCAAGGCATTGATATGG-3′, were used to PCR-amplify a 1300-bp fragment containing the entire VMA10open reading frame after the initial methionine. The primers introduce unique BglII and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively (underlined), used to subclone the PCR fragment intoBamHI- and EcoRI-digested pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to yield pLG46. Addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to E. coli cultures carrying pLG46 induces the synthesis of a 41-kDa glutathione S-transferase-Vma10p fusion protein that was purified and used to inject New Zealand White rabbits. Native gels were run, blotted, and probed as described previously (8Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, pre-run 6-cm 6% acrylamide gels were loaded and run for 100 min at 150 V and 4 °C in a continuous HEPES/imidazole buffer system (pH 7.4). Proteins were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes, autoclaved, blocked, and probed with antibodies as indicated in the figures. Whole cell extracts were prepared from wild-type (SF838-1D), vma2Δ(SF838-1D::vma2), vma3Δ (SF838-1D::vma3), and vma10Δ as described (18Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuolar membranes were isolated from wild-type and vma10Δ::LEU2 cells (LGY14) as described previously (19Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Wild-type vacuolar membranes were treated with potassium nitrate in the presence or absence of 5 mm ATP as described previously (20Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For glycerol gradient fractionation, vacuolar membranes were isolated from SF838-1D wild-type cells and washed three time with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA as described (19Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). 500 μg of vacuolar membranes were solubilized with 2% zwitterionic detergent ZW3-14 (Calbiochem) and separated by centrifugation through a 20–50% glycerol density gradient at 174,000 × g for 20 h using a Beckman SW41 rotor (20Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were collected (750 μl), and proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration) and separated by SDS-PAGE. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (12Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were probed with antibodies against the 100-, 60-, and 36-kDa V-ATPase subunits and polyclonal antibodies against Vma10p, as indicated in the figures. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products) after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham). Spheroplasts were prepared as described previously (8Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2PO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.2) for an estimated protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Large membranes and unlysed cells were removed by brief high speed microcentrifugation. A 1% volume of DSP (100 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added for a final concentration of 1 mm and allowed to react on ice for 90 min. The reaction was quenched with the addition of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 100 mm. Samples of the cross-linked reactions were combined 1:1 with 2 × Laemmli buffer without β-mercaptoethanol and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Lanes from this gel were cut out, soaked in 1 × Laemmli with β-mercaptoethanol, and then loaded sideways onto the stack of a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. These were transferred to PVDF and probed with antibodies as described in the figures. Yeast strains were grown to ∼0.8 A 600 in SMD buffered to pH 5.5 (50 mm MES, 50 mm MOPS). Cells were harvested (10 ml) and resuspended in 200 μl of SMD, pH 5.5. Expre35S35S label (NEN Life Science Products) was added in two equal aliquots during the first 5 min for a final concentration of 0.5 μCi/μl and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min total. Unlabeled methionine/cysteine (0.4 mm and 0.2 mm, final concentrations, respectively) in SMD pH 5.5 and 0.2% yeast extract was added to chase. Samples were removed at the indicated times and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) and incubated on ice. After two 1-ml acetone washes of the trichloroacetic acid pellet, samples were resuspended in 100 μl of MES-urea resuspension buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium azide) and resuspended by vigorous vortexing with acid-washed glass beads. Supernatant fractions were immunoprecipitated twice with antisera as indicated in the figures. Immunoprecipitation has been described previously (21Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics STORM PhosphorImager. The F subunit of the V-ATPase, Vma7p in yeast, interacts with both V1 and V0 sectors. It is necessary for V0 assembly, suggesting it may interact directly with the membrane sector (10Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the same time, Vma7p can be stripped from the membrane with nitrate (10Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is a component of cytosolic complexes seen on native gels (8Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Its role in the formation of V1 and how it modulates V0 assembly are not known. Previously, we used an epitope-tagged version of Vma7p to show its presence in cytosolic complexes II (A3B3DEFG) and IV (A2B2DF) on native gels (8Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using a new antibody raised against Vma7p itself, we probed native blots of extracts from a library of vmaΔ deletion strains (Fig.1 A). For comparison, we probed an identical blot with antibodies against Vma8p (Fig. 1 B). The presence of these subunits in both complexes II and IV was confirmed, although Vma7p in complex IV (in the vma4Δ andvma10Δ extracts) is just barely visible beneath a large band which we believe is nonspecific due to its appearance in thevma7Δ strain. We also observed a lower band (designated complex VI in Fig. 1) absent in the vma7Δ andvma8Δ strains. Additionally, an uncharacterized form of Vma8p, possibly a free or oligomeric form of the subunit, runs just below the position of complex IV in vma7Δ. Steady-state levels of complex VI are vmamutation-dependent, and the levels of both Vma7p and Vma8p are affected proportionally, suggesting they have a constant stoichiometry in this complex in all strains (Fig. 1). Invma3Δ and vma5Δ, the signal for Vma7p in complex VI is barely visible, although it can be seen after long exposure (data not shown). Complex VI appears to be in equilibria with larger complexes containing Vma7p and Vma8p, such as IV and II. Thevma1Δ and vma2Δ strains do not influence the mobility of the Vma7p and Vma8p bands, suggesting that Vma1p and Vma2p are not part of complex VI. Also, like complex III (subunits E and G; see below) and complex II, complex VI is found in wild-type cells, indicating it is not merely an artifact found in mutant strains. LikeVMA7, the yeast VMA10 gene encodes a small (13-kDa; subunit G) hydrophilic protein that copurifies with the V-ATPase and is required for its function (11Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cold inactivation studies on the yeast V-ATPase (11Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) indicated that Vma10p remained associated with the vacuolar membrane fraction while canonical V1 subunits, e.g. Vma1p and Vma4p, were released. Thus the subunit was initially assigned to the V0sector of the V-ATPase. However, under the experimental conditions used by these researchers, the hydrophilic subunit Vma6p, a known subunit of the V0 sector, was also released from the membranes, indicating that these conditions released both known V0 and V1 subunits. The homologous protein from the Manduca sexta V-ATPase (37% identical) fractionates with the V1 complex and can be stripped from membranes using both cold inactivation and treatment with a chaotropic reagent similar to the behavior of other V1 subunits (22Graf R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20908-20913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Lepier A. Graf R. Azuma M. Merzendorfer H. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8502-8508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Also, the mammalian V-ATPase subunit equivalent to Vma10p, subunit G, fractionates with the V1 sector and stimulates the ATPase activity of V1 (24Crider B.P. Andersen P. White A.E. Zhou Z. Li X. Mattsson J.P. Lundberg L. Keeling D.J. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Peng S.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10721-10728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The discrepancies between yeast and other systems led us to examine further the role of Vma10p in the yeast V-ATPase complex, and this has revised our view on the sector assignment for this subunit. Previous studies indicated that the stability of bona fide V0subunits are interdependent, since the loss of any one V0subunit results in the decreased steady-state level of the 100-kDa V0 subunit due to the rapid degradation of unassembled V0 subunits (12Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses of whole cell extracts and vacuolar vesicles prepared from wild-type andvmaΔ mutant strains are shown in Fig.2. Whole cell extracts prepared from yeast cells lacking a V1 subunit (vma2Δ) and avma10Δ deletion strain had the same level of 100-kDa protein as extracts from wild-type yeast cells. Only yeast cells lacking a V0 subunit (vma3Δ) showed reduced steady-state levels of the 100-kDa subunit. Vacuolar membrane preparations from vma10Δ cells revealed wild-type levels of the 100-kDa polypeptide present on the vacuolar membrane. It is evident that, in the absence of Vma10p, the V0 subunits are stable and targeted to the vacuole consistent with Vma10p being a V1 subunit. As with all vma deletion strains (except vma13Δ (26Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the V1 subunits fail to associate with the vacuolar membrane in vma10Δ mutant cells (12Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Vma10p was not released from the membrane by cold inactivation (11Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we tested whether it would be stripped from wild-type vacuolar membranes with the chaotropic reagent nitrate in the presence of ATP. Using antibodies specific for each subunit we examined the fractionation profile of both V1 and V0 subunits. When vacuolar membranes were treated with potassium nitrate alone, all V-ATPase subunits remained associated with the membrane pellet (P). Treatment of membranes with nitrate and ATP caused the release of V1 subunits such as the A subunit (Vma1p, 69 kDa) as shown in Fig. 3. The integral membrane 100-kDa V0 subunit (Vph1p) is not released by this treatment nor is the hydrophilic subunit Vma6p, which has been shown to be tightly associated with, and necessary for the assembly of, the V0sector (12Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vma10p was released from the membranes by this treatment, indicating that it is a V1 subunit. We have determined the fractionation profile of all V-ATPase subunits (except the proteolipids Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p) and have found that of all the subunits examined only the 100-kDa and 36-kDa V0 subunits remain tightly associated with the membrane after treatment with nitrate and ATP (data not shown). We have observed that while both V1 and V0 subunits fractionate with the intact V-ATPase complex, V0 subunits also sediment together to a position of lower molecular mass when detergent-solubilized vacuolar membranes are separated on a glycerol density gradient (27Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15037-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). V1 subunits, such as the B subunit (Vma2p, 60 kDa), fractionate to a single peak possessing maximum ATPase activity (Fig.4). A biphasic profile is observed for the 100-kDa and 36-kDa V0 subunits, with one peak coincident with the V1 subunits representing fully assembled V-ATPase. A second, lighter peak is observed containing only V0 proteins representing V0 subcomplexes present on vacuolar membranes. Vma10p fractionates only with the fully assembled V-ATPase complex and is not found in the fractions where the V0 sector occurs alone. Taken together, the genetic and biochemical data indicate that Vma10p is a V1 subunit. Deletions of V1 subunits can result in the formation of subcomplexes of the peripheral sector (8Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows the results from a native gel analysis of extracts from wild-type, vma4Δ, andvma10Δ strains of yeast, revealing that Vma10p is required for assembly of complex II. These data further support the assignment of Vma10p to the V1 sector. Also, the band pattern seen for the vma10Δ strain appears nearly identical to that of thevma4Δ strain, distinguished by the presence of complexes IV and V, hitherto unique to the vma4Δ strain (see also Fig. 1). Complex IV was previously characterized as a large subcomplex lacking Vma4p. Apparently Vma10p is also absent from this complex. This native gel profile further suggests Vma4p and Vma10p might interact to form complex III. To identify complexes containing Vma10p, antibodies were prepared against peptides and used to probe native blots of extracts from our collection of vmaΔ mutants (Fig.6 A). An identical blot was probed with antibodies against Vma4p for comparison (Fig.6 B). Vma10p is present in complexes I and II, indicating that it is a component of the soluble V1. Vma10p appears to run at the same position as complex III in the vma7Δ andvma8Δ strains, suggesting that it is a subunit of this complex. In other strains, however, it runs as a smear below the position of complex III. These migration patterns are vmaΔmutant-specific, i.e. while they differ between deletion strains, they are consistent from extract to extract prepared from the same strain. Smearing may be due to associations with other proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids. Because the native gel is pH 7.4 and Vma10p has a pI ∼9, it must be associated with other molecules to move into the gel at all. The odd behavior of Vma10p in the native gel demanded an alternate approach. We examined the proximity of Vma4p and Vma10p by cross-linking experiments, treating extracts from wild-type and deletion strains with the reducible cross-linker DSP, followed by two-dimensional (non-reducing 1° followed by reducing 2°) gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. A substantial fraction of both Vma4p and Vma10p travel together off the diagonal (Fig. 7), indicating they can be cross-linked to a significant degree in extracts from all strains except their cognate deletion strains. The cross-linked product has a molecular mass of approximately 46 kDa, allowing for one of each subunit (27-kDa E subunit and 13-kDa G subunit, respectively) in the linkage product. This suggests that these subunits interact specifically and independent of other subunits or complexes. The calculated mass of complex III is 96 ± 28 kDa, twice that of the cross-linked product, suggesting complex III may be a tetramer (E2G2) as previously proposed (8Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Examination of the same membranes with antibodies to Vma2p and Vma8p indicated that these subunits did not undergo any significant cross-linking to other subunits under our conditions (data not shown). These data further support the idea that the Vma4p-Vma10p interaction is close and specific. Like complex VI, complex III is present not only in mutant cells, but in the wild-type strain as well. In general, the steady-state levels of individual V1 subunits are relatively unaffected by deletions of other V1 or V0 subunits (18Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed, however, that the steady-state level of Vma4p was greatly diminished in thevma10Δ strain (Fig. 7; data not shown). We performed a pulse-chase analysis of subunit degradation in wild-type and deletion strains (Fig. 8). Vma4p is strongly destabilized in the absence of Vma10p (Fig. 8 A) with a half-life of ∼1 h. It is slightly destabilized in the absence of Vma1p or Vma2p, where it has a half-life on the order of about 2 h. In other strains the half-life of Vma4p is greater than 4 h. This correlates to the steady-state levels of complex III observed in these strains. Other V1 subunits (Vma1p, Vma2p, and Vma8p) do not show such variable levels of stability in the absence of Vma10p (Fig. 8 B). Thus, the in vivo stability of Vma4p is highly dependent on other subunits, especially Vma10p. The subunits Vma4p (E), Vma7p (F), Vma8p (D), and Vma10p (G) are unique to the V-ATPase class of proton pumps. While subunits A (Vma1p) and B (Vma2p) show significant sequence homology to the β and α subunits, respectively, of the F-type ATPases, the γ, δ, and ε subunits which comprise the core/stalk region of the F1enzyme and attach and couple it to the FO have no sequence homologs yet identified among the V-type enzymes (5Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 6Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Dittrich P. Taiz L. Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Manolson M.F. Poole R.J. Date T. Oshima T. Konishi J. Denda K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, because these enzymes are structurally and functionally similar, it is reasonable to assume there is some structural and functional homolog to the stalk region of the F-type pump in the V-ATPase. There is an heuristic value to thinking of the subunits Vma4p, Vma7p, Vma8p, and Vma10p (as well as Vma5p, Vma6p, and Vma13p, perhaps) as couplers between the catalytic and proton pumping subunits of the enzyme. V1 can assemble to a high degree in the cytosol, although in wild-type cells the assembly of the two sectors may not be separate and discrete; subcomplexes of each sector may associate before either sector is complete. Peripheral subunits capable of interacting with V0 components might do so at early stages of V1 assembly, although these early V1-V0 interactions are not obligatory for assembly of either sector alone or subsequent assembly of the complete enzyme. The dependence of V0 stability on the presence of Vma7p establishes a link between the catalytic and proton translocating sectors. Proposals that Vma4p (29Bowman E.J. Steinhardt A. Bowman B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1237: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), Vma8p (30Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), or both (8Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) could have functional homology to the γ subunit of the F-type enzyme reinforce a similar theme. Fig. 9 shows our model for the V-ATPase in the context of its assembly from separate sectors. The final structure focuses on the position of subunits discussed here. Vma4p and Vma8p serve as structure/function homologs of the γ subunit; thus they are shown emerging from the core of the V1 sector. Vma7p and Vma10p interact with Vma8p and Vma4p, respectively, and although both are clearly components of the V1 sector, they may each interact with the V0 sector. These are key components of the stalk region, and these subunits interact to form partial complexes, specifically complexes III and VI, prior to incorporation into the V1 sector. The product ofVMA5 (Vma5p, the C subunit) and VMA13 (Vma13p, (26Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) may also be involved with interactions between the V1and V0 sectors. Subunits C and E (Vma4p) of the bovine clathrin-coated vesicle can be co-immunoprecipitated (31Puopolo K. Sczekan M. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these subunits can be cross-linked to subunit D (Vma8p) and the proteolipid (subunit c, Vma3p, Vma11p, and/or Vma16p) (32Adachi I. Puopolo K. Marquez-Sterling N. Arai H. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 967-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also have data indicating that Vma5p is involved in glucose-mediated disassembly of V1 and V0(33Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2J. Tomashek, unpublished data. Complex VI exhibits consistent behavior. The steady-state levels of Vma7p and Vma8p in complex VI parallel each other as they vary among different vmaΔ mutant strains, suggesting a constant stoichiometry between these subunits within this complex. The level of the complex itself varies in relationship to the formation of larger complexes, with less complex VI present when complex II can be formed, suggesting an equilibrium between these forms in vivo. Accumulation of complex VI in some deletion strains appears to be due to an inability to assemble further. Complex III is mercurial. This complex depends upon both Vma4p and Vma10p (Fig. 6 B, lane 9). On native gels, Vma10p occasionally runs at the position of complex III (Fig. 6 A,lanes 7 and 8), but in some strains the position of complex III (as defined by the position of Vma4p; Fig.6 B) appears to be independent of the position of Vma10p. As reported previously, the steady-state level of complex III is affected by the absence of Vma1p and Vma2p (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2 and 3, and Ref. 8Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although neither subunit is found in complex III. However, the dependence of complex III on Vma10p appears to be much more absolute than its dependence on either Vma1p or Vma2p, and Vma4p and Vma10p cross-link to each other with high efficiency in all strains in which they are present. No significant cross-linking to other subunits (Vma2p and Vma8p) was observed (data not shown). The dependence of Vma4p stability on the presence of other subunits raises interesting possibilities in terms of the regulation of assembly. Complex III and its components are the first V1subunits found to be sensitive to the presence or absence of other subunits. Since complex III appears to be a late addition to the complete sector, regulation of this complex may control the level of membrane-competent V1 sector available for assembly into the complete enzyme. VMA4 is also unusual in that it has two putative TUF binding sites in its 5′ region, approximately 250 bp upstream of the initiation codon. These sites have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of this subunit. Hence, availability of this subunit appears to be tightly controlled at all levels of biosynthesis. Regulation of the ATPase through control of V1 assembly may be a significant control mechanism in vivo, and this mechanism may be independent of regulation by the equilibrium between separate V1 and V0 sectors and the complete holoenzyme. We thank Dr. Nathan Nelson for the gift of the W303-based vmaΔ strains used for the native gel and cross-linking studies. We would also like to thank Dr. Sidney Scott for critical help with the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2009507862,"Transcriptional repression of the mouse vascular smooth muscle α-actin gene in fibroblasts and myoblasts is mediated, in part, by the interaction of two single-stranded DNA binding activities with opposite strands of an essential transcription enhancer factor-1 recognition element (Sun, S., Stoflet, E.

One of these activities, previously designated vascular actin single-stranded DNA-binding factor 2 includes two distinct polypeptides (p44 and p46) which specifically interact with the purine-rich strand of both the enhancer and a related element in a protein coding exon of the gene (Kelm, R. J., Jr., Sun, S., Strauch, A. R., and Getz, M. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 24278–24285). Expression screening of a mouse lung cDNA library with a vascular actin single-stranded DNA-binding factor 2 recognition element has now resulted in the isolation of two distinct cDNA clones that encode p46 and p44. One of these proteins is identical to Purα, a retinoblastoma-binding protein previously implicated in both transcriptional activation and DNA replication. The other is a related family member, presumably Purβ. Comparative band shift and Southwestern blot analyses conducted with cellular p46, p44, and cloned Pur proteins synthesized in vitro and in vivo, establish identity of p46 with Purα and p44 with Purβ. This study implicates Purα and/or Purβ in the control of vascular smooth muscle α-actin gene transcription. Transcriptional repression of the mouse vascular smooth muscle α-actin gene in fibroblasts and myoblasts is mediated, in part, by the interaction of two single-stranded DNA binding activities with opposite strands of an essential transcription enhancer factor-1 recognition element (Sun, S., Stoflet, E. S., Cogan, J. G., Strauch, A. R., and Getz, M. J. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 2429–2436).

Transcriptional activation or repression of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes is often mediated by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (i.e. transcription factors) that respond to extracellular signals by interacting with criticalcis-acting regulatory elements. Activator or repressor proteins generally bind to double-stranded DNA recognition sites distal to the TATA box and influence promoter activity by interacting, either directly or through an adaptor protein, with factor(s) comprising the RNA polymerase II basal transcription complex (1Tjian R.

In particular, some ssDNA-binding proteins, such as the far upstream element-binding protein and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, have been shown to utilize cis elements, prone to forming non-B-DNA structures, as docking sites to effect gene expression (13Bazar L.

Activation and repression of the mouse VSM α-actin promoter in both fibroblasts and undifferentiated myoblasts is mediated, in part, by positive and negative trans-acting factors that bind to a 30-base pair polypurine-polypyrimidine tract containing an inverted, muscle-specific M-CAT consensus motif (AGGAATG) (16Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cogan J.G. Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11310-11321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). While activation likely requires the M-CAT-binding protein, transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) (17Cogan J.G. Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11310-11321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), repression appears to result from the interaction of two, tissue-restricted, ssDNA binding activities which putatively function by stabilizing local alterations in DNA secondary structure that preclude TEF-1 binding to double-stranded DNA (16Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently reported that one of these ssDNA binding activities, designated vascular actin single-stranded DNA-binding factor 2 (VACssBF2), also interacts with a conserved 30-base coding sequence element (CE) which borders the 3′ end of intron 2 in the mouse VSM α-actin gene (18Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24278-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this CE sequence was found to repress promoter activity when positioned 5′ and adjacent to either a TEF-1 or activator protein-1 enhancer element (18Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24278-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), further confirming the ability of VACssBF2 to function as a transcriptional repressor.Our initial efforts to biochemically characterize VACssBF2 prompted us to search the literature for known ssDNA-binding proteins that exhibited a similar preference for purine-rich sequences and possessed a molecular weight comparable to the p46 and p44 components of VACssBF2. Our search revealed a protein known as Purα (19Bergemann A.D. Ma Z. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5673-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This ssDNA-binding protein was originally identified as a HeLa cell nuclear protein that interacted with a region of stably-bent DNA in the 5′-region of the human c-myc gene, designated the PUR (for purine-rich) element (20Bergemann A.D. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This sequence element is present in several eukaryotic zones of initiation of DNA replication as well as in the flanking regions of a number of different genes (20Bergemann A.D. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although the exact role of Purα in mammalian DNA replication is still unknown, recent studies have implicated Purα in the transcriptional activation of several different genes (5Haas S. Thatikunta P.

Moreover, the identification and partial cloning of a cDNA encoding the C-terminal region of a homologous protein, termed Purβ (19Bergemann A.D. Ma Z. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5673-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggested that a family of Pur proteins may exist in higher eukaryotes. In this study, we have utilized both biochemical and molecular cloning techniques to reveal the identity of the p46 and p44 components of VACssBF2 as mouse Purα and Purβ, respectively.DISCUSSIONThe varied expression of VSM α-actin in phenotypically altered smooth muscle cells and stromal fibroblasts associated with such pathological processes as arteriosclerosis (29Gabbiani G.

Indeed, a number of studies conducted with chicken, mouse, and human VSM α-actin promoters have indicated that cell context is critically important in determining the operative regulatory elements and DNA-binding proteins that mediate transcriptional activation and repression (36Min B.

Our previous analyses of the mouse VSM α-actin promoter pointed to a novel molecular model in which sequence-specific VACssBFs repress promoter activity in cells of both myogenic and fibroblastic lineage by interacting with opposing strands of an essential TEF-1 enhancer element (16Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cogan J.G. Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol.

One of these factors, VACssBF1, has been cloned and is identical to the mouse Y-box protein MSY1 (40Cogan J.G. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abstr.): 950Google Scholar). Interestingly, the human homolog, YB-1, has also been reported to function as a transcriptional repressor within the context of the major histocompatibility class II DRA (41MacDonald G.H. Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Ting J.P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3527-3533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) andgrp78 (42Li W.W. Hsiung Y. Wong V. Galvin K. Zhou Y. Shi Y. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) promoters. In the mouse VSM α-actin promoter, MSY1 interacts with the pyrimidine-rich, antisense strand of the TEF-1 enhancer. The other factor, VACssBF2, binds to the purine-rich sense strand of the TEF-1 enhancer and a related element in a protein-coding exon of the gene (18Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24278-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). While initial data suggested that VACssBFs function in a cooperative manner to disrupt TEF-1 enhancer function (16Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), recent experiments conducted with chimeric promoters have indicated that VACssBF2 can repress enhancer activity in the absence of detectable VACssBF1/MSY1-binding to the opposing strand (18Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24278-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Owing to the relative paucity of reports documenting a role for ssDNA-binding proteins in transcriptional repression, we sought to characterize VACssBF2 using biochemical and molecular cloning techniques. Southwestern blotting of heparin-agarose fractions enriched in VACssBF2 revealed three prominent bands of M r∼115,000, 46,000, and 44,000 (Fig. 1). However, only the p46 and p44 species demonstrated high affinity, purine-rich ssDNA-binding specificity (Figs. 2 and 3). Expression screening of a mouse lung cDNA library with a multimer of VACssBF2 exon recognition element yielded two cDNA clones (9-5 and 10-1) that encode related ssDNA-binding proteins (Figs. 4 and 5). Clone 9-5 encodes Purα, a purine-rich ssDNA-binding protein previously shown to interact with (GGN) n repeats in sequence elements functionally linked to both DNA replication and transcription (5Haas S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14990-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based upon homology to a partial cDNA clone of human Purβ previously reported (19Bergemann A.D. Ma Z. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5673-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), clone 10-1 encodes mouse Purβ. These results were not surprising given the prior finding that cellular p46 and p44 could also bind to an authentic Purα ssDNA-recognition element in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3). However, clones 9-5 and 10-1 encode full-length proteins with predicted molecular masses of 34.9 and 33.9 kDa, respectively. While these values differ substantially from the apparent molecular weights of p46 and p44, both in vitro andin vivo synthesized Purα and Purβ co-migrate with cellular p46 and p44 in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 6). Thus, the apparent discrepancies in molecular weight are a result of anomalous electrophoretic migration.Because the cloning and detection strategies employed in these studies were based on affinity for a VACssBF2 ssDNA recognition element, it might be argued that cellular p46 and p44 are not identical to the Pur proteins but simply exhibit similar ssDNA-binding properties. We believe this is highly unlikely for the following reasons. First, with the exception of p115, no other bands are detectable in band shift, Southwestern blot, or biotinylated ssDNA capture experiments using fibroblast nuclear extracts and either VACssBF2 or human c-myc Purα ssDNA oligonucleotide probes (Figs. 1, 2, 3, and data not shown). Second, and most importantly, Purα and Purβ exactly co-migrate with cellular p46 and p44 when overexpressed in fibroblasts and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6). Thus, any non-Pur proteins which exhibit Pur-like ssDNA binding activity would have to exactly co-migrate with authentic Purα and Purβ. Based on these considerations, we conclude that the p46 and p44 components of the VACssBF2 complex correspond to Purα and Purβ, respectively.With the molecular cloning of the p46 and p44 components of VACssBF2, we have now identified 4 of the 5 proteins previously shown to interact with single- or double-stranded forms of an essential VSM α-actin TEF-1 enhancer element (16Sun S.

Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11310-11321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), MSY1 (or VACssBF1), and now Purα and Purβ (or VACssBF2 p46 and p44). Only the relatively weak and nonspecific ssDNA-binding p115 component of VACssBF2 remains to be cloned and identified. Curiously, both cellular Purα and YB-1 (the human homolog of MSY-1) have also been implicated in the activation of early (Purα) and late (YB-1) gene transcription of human JC polyomavirus in glial cells of the central nervous system (22Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, Purα and YB-1 were found to function cooperatively in that each protein was capable of modulating the binding of the other to its respective viral promoter ssDNA-binding site (23Chen N.N. Chang C. Gallia G.L. Kerr D.A. Johnson E.M. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Frisque R.J. Bollag B. Khalili K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since certain astroglial cells are known to also express VSM α-actin (44Lecain E. Alliot F. Laine M.C. Calas B. Pessac B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 45Abd-El-Basset E.M. Fedoroff S. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 125: 117-120Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the functional association of Y-box and Pur proteins may be common to VSM α-actin expressing cell types.It is interesting that human Purα and YB-1 function as activators of JC polyomavirus gene transcription in glial cells while mouse Purα and/or Purβ, and MSY1 apparently function as repressors of VSM α-actin gene transcription in myoblasts and fibroblasts. While it is not uncommon for a transcription factor, such as Purα or YB-1, to act as either an activator or as a repressor depending upon the influence of other cell and/or promoter-specific gene regulatory proteins, the structural differences between mouse Purα and Purβ are nevertheless provocative (Fig. 5). Because glutamine-rich sequences have been associated with transcriptional activation domains (1Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), the absence of a Q7 sequence and other differences in the COOH-terminal region of Purβ may be of functional significance in terms of repression. Perhaps Purβ antagonizes activation by Purα via competitive ssDNA binding. Elucidation of the individual functional roles of MSY1, Purα, and Purβ, in repression of the VSM α-actin gene promoter in myoblasts and fibroblasts will obviously require further investigation. Several questions to be addressed include 1) do these proteins possess the ability to modulate TEF-1 enhancer topology, 2) do they interact with the enhancer in a mutually-dependent or independent manner, 3) what are the consequences of such interactions in terms of enhancer function, 4) are these proteins differentially expressed or post-translationally modified in a cell- or tissue-specific manner, and 5) does Purβ, like Purα (27Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z.-W. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24352-24360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), interact with the retinoblastoma protein? Answers to such questions should lead to an improved understanding of the mechanisms that regulate VSM α-actin gene expression during smooth muscle myogenesis, cutaneous wound healing, vascular injury, fibrocontractive disease, and stromal responses to neoplasia. Transcriptional activation or repression of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes is often mediated by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (i.e. transcription factors) that respond to extracellular signals by interacting with criticalcis-acting regulatory elements. Activator or repressor proteins generally bind to double-stranded DNA recognition sites distal to the TATA box and influence promoter activity by interacting, either directly or through an adaptor protein, with factor(s) comprising the RNA polymerase II basal transcription complex (1Tjian R.

In particular, some ssDNA-binding proteins, such as the far upstream element-binding protein and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, have been shown to utilize cis elements, prone to forming non-B-DNA structures, as docking sites to effect gene expression (13Bazar L.

In support of a role for ssDNA-binding proteins as transcription factors, our study of the vascular smooth muscle (VSM) α-actin gene has revealed the integral involvement of several ssDNA-binding proteins in the control of promoter activity (16Sun S.

Activation and repression of the mouse VSM α-actin promoter in both fibroblasts and undifferentiated myoblasts is mediated, in part, by positive and negative trans-acting factors that bind to a 30-base pair polypurine-polypyrimidine tract containing an inverted, muscle-specific M-CAT consensus motif (AGGAATG) (16Sun S.

While activation likely requires the M-CAT-binding protein, transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) (17Cogan J.G. Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol.

The stability of this CPSF·CstF·RNA complex is thought to determine the efficiency of 3′-end processing. Since downstream elements reveal high sequence variability, in vitro selection experiments with highly purified CstF were performed to investigate the sequence requirements for CstF-RNA interaction. CstF was purified from calf thymus and from HeLa cells. Surprisingly, calf thymus CstF contained an additional, novel form of the 64-kDa subunit with a molecular mass of 70 kDa. RNA ligands selected by HeLa and calf thymus CstF contained three highly conserved sequence elements as follows: element 1 (AUGCGUUCCUCGUCC) and two closely related elements, element 2a (YGUGUYN 0–4UUYAYUGYGU) and element 2b (UUGYUN 0–4AUUUACU(U/G)N 0–2YCU). All selected sequences tested functioned as downstream elements in 3′-end processing in vitro. A computer survey of the EMBL data library revealed significant homologies to all selected elements in naturally occurring 3′-untranslated regions. The majority of element 2a homologies was found downstream of coding sequences. Therefore, we postulate that this element represents a novel consensus sequence for downstream elements in 3′-end processing of pre-mRNA.

Therefore, we postulate that this element represents a novel consensus sequence for downstream elements in 3′-end processing of pre-mRNA. The primary transcripts (pre-mRNAs) of a eukaryotic cell undergo several different maturation steps to become fully functional messenger RNAs (mRNAs). One of these maturation events is the 3′-end processing reaction, during which the pre-mRNA receives a new 3′-end that is in almost all cases a poly(A) tail. First, the pre-mRNA is endonucleolytically cleaved at the polyadenylation site (poly(A) site). In a second tightly coupled event, the polyadenylation reaction, approximately 250 adenosine residues are added to the upstream cleavage product, whereas the downstream fragment is rapidly degraded (for reviews, see Refs. 1Keller W.

In vivo and in vitro studies have revealed a requirement for distinct sequence elements for 3′-end processing of pre-mRNAs, a highly conserved AAUAAA sequence located upstream of the poly(A) site and so-called downstream elements. Moreover, several sequences located upstream of the AAUAAA signal have been shown to enhance the cleavage reaction (for reviews, see Refs. 3Wahle E. Keller W. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 1985; 41: 349-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that a UUUUU element located 6–25 nucleotides downstream of the AAUAAA sequence is sufficient to confer cleavage activity to a substrate whose natural downstream region has been completely deleted (14Chou Z.F. Chen F. Wilusz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2525-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Due to the abundance of uracil and guanine residues in these motifs, downstream elements are usually referred to as U- or G/U-rich elements. One of the best analyzed downstream regions is that of the SV40 late pre-mRNA. Although it was not possible to identify single nucleotides that are essential for poly(A) site function (15Conway L. Wickens M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4177-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a deletion of about 20 nucleotides downstream of the poly(A) site inhibits 3′-end processing (16Gimmi E.R. Soprano K.J. Rosenberg M. Reff M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8977-8997Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17Zarkower D. Wickens M. J. Biol.

The SV40 late downstream element consists of two parts. Each part alone allowed efficient processing when the other part was substituted with unrelated polylinker sequence. Only the substitution of both parts together inhibited cleavage of the SV40 late pre-mRNA (17Zarkower D. Wickens M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5780-5788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other bipartite downstream elements were identified in the β-globin genes of rabbit (19Gil A. Proudfoot N.J.

It has also been demonstrated that the distance between the AAUAAA signal and the downstream element is critical. Moving the downstream element further downstream can not only abolish cleavage but can also shift the cleavage site (14Chou Z.F. Chen F. Wilusz J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16330-16334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, six factors involved in the cleavage and polyadenylation reactions have been identified as follows: cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), cleavage factors Im and IIm (CF Im, CF IIm), poly(A) polymerase (PAP), and poly(A) binding protein II (for reviews, see Refs. 1Keller W. Cell. 1995; 81: 829-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3Wahle E. Keller W. Trends Biochem.

Most of these factors have been purified, and several have been cloned. Interestingly, many homologs to the mammalian 3′-end processing components have been found in yeast suggesting a conserved mechanism in lower and higher eukaryotes (for reviews, see Refs. 2Keller W. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and 26Manley J.L. Takagaki Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1481-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The recognition of the AAUAAA sequence by CPSF is thought to be the first step in the formation of a 3′-end processing complex. This initial complex is stabilized by the subsequent binding of CstF to the downstream element (27Gilmartin G.M. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2180-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Gilmartin G.M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2432-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Weiss E.A. Gilmartin G.M. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The stability of this commitment or ternary complex correlates with the efficiency of poly(A) site usage (29Weiss E.A. Gilmartin G.M. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CF Im, CF IIm, and PAP then join to form a fully active 3′-end processing complex. CstF consists of three polypeptides with molecular masses of 50, 64, and 77 kDa (28Gilmartin G.M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2432-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2432-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T.

A correlation between CstF activity and the usage of different poly(A) sites was observed during the adenoviral life cycle (35Mann K.P. Weiss E.A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2411-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and mouse B-cell development (36Edwalds-Gilbert G. Milcarek C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6420-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that overexpression of the 64-kDa subunit of CstF in stably transformed B-cells induces the switch from the membrane-bound to the secreted form of immunoglobulins via alternative polyadenylation (37Takagaki Y. Seipelt R.L. Peterson M.L. Manley J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 941-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that CstF plays a critical role in 3′-end processing. Since the sequence requirements for CstF-RNA interaction have only been poorly characterized, we performed in vitro selection experiments (SELEX, Ref. 38Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7993) Google Scholar) with CstF purified from calf thymus whole cell extracts and HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Interestingly, CstF purified from calf thymus contained an additional polypeptide with a molecular mass of 70 kDa, which represents a novel form of the 64-kDa subunit. CstF preferentially selected highly conserved sequence elements rather than guanine- and/or uracil-rich sequences per se. The selected sequences functioned as downstream elements in 3′-end processing in vitro, and homologies to them were found in natural 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of many genes, suggesting a role of these sequences as downstream elements in vivo. Macroprep Q resin was purchased from Bio-Rad; Blue Sepharose was prepared as described previously (39Bienroth S. Wahle E. Suter-Crazzolara C. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other column resins and prepacked FPLC columns were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., as well as RNAguard and m7GpppG. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was purchased from Serva, leupeptin hemisulfate and Nonidet P-40 from Fluka, pepstatin from Bachem, and ammonium sulfate from Life Technologies Inc. All restriction enzymes, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs; creatine kinase, creatine phosphate, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, Klenow enzyme, and SP6 RNA polymerase were from Boehringer Mannheim. T7 RNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene, and Taq DNA polymerase (AmpliTaq) was from Perkin-Elmer. DNA sequencing was performed with Sequenase version 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp.). Cordycepin 5′-triphosphate (3′-dATP), dNTPs, and NTPs were from Boehringer Mannheim; all radioactively labeled NTPs and dNTPs were from Amersham Corp. Polyvinyl alcohol was purchased from Sigma, and dithiothreitol (DTT) was from GERBU Biotechnik GmbH. Whole cell extract from 2 kg of calf thymus was applied to two DEAE-Sepharose fast flow columns as described previously (39Bienroth S. Wahle E. Suter-Crazzolara C. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The flow-throughs were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate (50% saturation). Consecutive backwashes with ammonium sulfate were performed (45, 25, and 20% saturation). The 20% ammonium sulfate pellet (10.7 g of protein) was dialyzed and applied to Blue Sepharose columns. CstF activity was further purified by heparin-Sepharose, Macroprep Q, Mono Q FPLC, Mono S FPLC, Superose 6 FPLC, and poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography. The final poly(U)-Sepharose column (1.5 ml) was equilibrated with 35 ml of 0.3 m KCl in buffer G (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.02% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) and developed with a 20-ml gradient from 0.3 to 2 m KCl. CstF activity eluted around 1 m KCl, and the fractions were pooled and concentrated (Centricon-30, Amicon) to a final protein concentration of 48 μg/ml. This fraction (Fig.1 A, lane 1) was used for selection experiments. For the first purification of HeLa CstF, nuclear extracts (5Wahle E. Keller W. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. RNA Processing: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 1-34Google Scholar) were prepared from 8.4 × 1010 HeLa cells (2.6 g of protein). The DEAE-Sepharose flow-through was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation), and no further backwashes were performed. Macroprep Q, Mono S, and Superose 6 columns were omitted. Single fractions of the final poly(U)-Sepharose column that contained CstF activity were dialyzed against 20 mm KCl in buffer G. One fraction was used for the selection experiments (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The protein concentration of this fraction was 32 μg/ml. A second purification was from 5.8 × 1010HeLa cells (approximately 2 g of protein). Nonidet P-40 was omitted; the DEAE-Sepharose flow-through was not precipitated with ammonium sulfate. The poly(U)-Sepharose column was loaded at a salt concentration of 0.25 m KCl and developed with a gradient (25 ml) from 0.25 to 2 m KCl. CstF containing fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm KCl in buffer G. The protein concentration of the fraction used for selection experiments (Fig.1 A, lane 3) was 64 μg/ml. CPSF was purified from calf thymus (39Bienroth S. Wahle E. Suter-Crazzolara C. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant bovine PAP was prepared as described previously (40Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Crude fractions of CF Im and IIm were prepared as follows: HeLa nuclear extracts were diluted with buffer G to 75 mm KCl and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column equilibrated with 75 mm KCl in buffer G. The column was developed with a gradient (10 column volumes) from 75 to 500 mm KCl. Fractions containing CF Im/IIm activity were pooled and loaded directly onto an 8-ml Mono Q FPLC column. The column was developed with a gradient (25 column volumes) from 100 to 500 mm KCl in buffer G. CF Im/IIm activity eluted between 250 and 300 mm KCl. These fractions were dialyzed against 100 mm KCl in buffer G and used for cleavage reactions. DNA oligonucleotides were used to transcribe RNA substrates for the first round of the SELEX procedure (38Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7993) Google Scholar). Oligo 1 (5′ TAGGCTAGGATCCATCTTGT(N 20)ATCGTTCGTGAGCTCGTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACGCG 3′) contained a BamHI restriction site in the 5′ part, a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence (underlined) and aSacI restriction site in the 3′ part, and encoded an RNA of 60 nt (5′ GGGACGAGCUCACGAACGAU(N 20)ACAAGAUGGAUCCUAGCCUA 3′). 4 pmol of both oligo 1 and oligo 2 (5′ CGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG 3′; complementary to the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence) were annealed. Transcriptions were performed as recommended by the manufacturer at 37 °C for 1 h, and transcripts were gel-purified. Filter binding reactions (20 μl) contained 0.2 mm DTT, 0.01% v/v Nonidet P-40, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mm ATP, 1.5 mmMgCl2, CstF as indicated and were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were filtered under vacuum through BA 83 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher und Schüll) that had been equilibrated with buffer W (50 mm KCl, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT) and saturated with 20 μg of Escherichia coli total RNA. Filters were washed with 4 ml of ice-cold buffer W. The selected RNAs were eluted from the nitrocellulose filters with 350 μl of urea elution buffer (41Tuerk C. Eddy S. Parma D. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The eluate was extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated, and the RNA pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of H2O containing 50 pmol of oligo 3 (5′ TAGGCTAGGATCCATCTTGT 3′). After annealing of oligo 3 to the RNA, reverse transcription was performed in a volume of 30 μl in the presence of 25 units of RNAguard and 15 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase as recommended by the manufacturer. After 45 min at 37 °C, 70 μl of H2O was added, and the DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 30 μl of H2O. One-third of this sample was amplified by PCR in a final volume of 50 μl in the presence of 10 mm Tricine (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 0.01% w/v gelatin, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.4 mm of each dNTP and 50 pmol of both oligo 3 and 4 (5′ CGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGACGAGCTCACGAACGAT 3′). PCRs were performed in a HYBAID reactor (Biotechnology LTD; 30 cycles: 15 s 94 °C, 30 s 51 °C, 30 s 72 °C; 1 cycle 5 min 72 °C). The DNA was gel-purified, phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 10 μl of H2O. 2–5 μl of this DNA were used either to transcribe RNA for the next round of selection or was subcloned. The following selection conditions were applied as follows: the first round used 4 pmol of CstF (0.2 μm), and subsequent rounds used 0.4 pmol (0.02 μm). The RNA concentration varied as follows: round 1, 0.2 μm; rounds 2 and 3, 0.2 μm; round 4, 0.4 μm; rounds 5 and 6, 1 μm; round 7, 2 μm; and round 8, 20 μm. PCR products from the final round of selection were digested with BamHI andSacI and subcloned into Bluescript KS vectors (Stratagene) for sequencing. SV40 wild type RNA was transcribed from the plasmid pSV-L (15Conway L. Wickens M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4177-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSV-141/-1 (17Zarkower D. Wickens M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5780-5788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is an SV40 late derivative of which the complete downstream region was replaced by aXbaI linker and pBR322 sequences. The XbaI site located in the polylinker region of the plasmid pSV-141/-1 was deleted by digestion with BamHI and SalI, the recessed 3′-termini were filled with Klenow enzyme. The resulting plasmid (pSVΔ-1) contains a single XbaI site immediately downstream of the natural polyadenylation site. DNA oligonucleotides containing XbaI site overhangs (CTAG) at their 5′-ends and encoding sequences of interest in either sense or antisense orientation were annealed and subcloned into the XbaI site of pSVΔ-1. The correct insertions were confirmed by sequencing. All pSVΔ-1 derivatives were linearized with EcoRI, pSV-L withDraI, and uniformly labeled RNA substrates were obtained by SP6 RNA polymerase transcription and gel purification (42Rüegsegger U. Beyer K. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6107-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cleavage reactions were performed as described previously (42Rüegsegger U. Beyer K. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6107-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 20 fmol radioactively labeled RNA substrate were used and reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. In some experiments, 0.5 mm 3′-dATP and 1.5 mm MgCl2 were replaced by 1 mm ATP and 1 mm EDTA. HeLa CstF was titrated in the range of 0 and 10 ng, and crude CF Im/IIm fractions (10 μl) were used. The cleavage reactions were quantitated with a PhosphorImager 425 (Molecular Dynamics) and IPlab Gel (version 1.5, Signal Analytics Corp.). The calculation of cleavage activity took into account the loss of radioactivity present in the downstream cleavage fragment. To compare the cleavage activities of SVΔ-1 derivatives with SV40 late pre-mRNA, the percentage of cleavage obtained with 4.5 ng of CstF and SV40 was set to 100%. These relative cleavage activities were determined in at least three independent cleavage reactions for each construct (except for SV-B13: two independent experiments), and their averages are presented in Fig. 3. Proteins were separated on an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel, blotted on nitrocellulose, and detected with chemiluminescence staining (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.) as recommended by the manufacturer. The CstF-64 polyclonal antibodies were diluted 1:10000. 100 fmol of CstF and 400 fmol of radioactively labeled RNA (Fig. 2, A-1) were incubated in 12.5 μl including 2 mm DTT, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mm ATP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Nonidet-P40, 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature. After UV irradiation (500 kJ, Stratalinker UV1800, Stratagene), 200 ng of RNase were added and reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before separation on a SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed (20% 2-propanol, 10% acetic acid), dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR films. The different consensus elements selected by CstF were translated into specific search programs written in VAX Pascal (43Dandekar T. Hentze M.W. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 45-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and used to screen the EMBL data library (44Kahn P. Cameron G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar; release 48Day I.N.M. Gene (Amst .). 1992; 110: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). First, the programs searched for the presence of the polyadenylation signal AATAAA (no mismatch allowed). If this signal had been found, for each consensus element a search up to 50 nt downstream would be conducted subsequently. Pool 1 was obtained with element 1 demanding ATGCGTT with at least 5 matches and CCTCGTCC directly following. Pool 2a, screened with element 2a, demanded the sequence YGTGTY with at least 4 matches, directly or up to 5 nt later followed by TTYAYTG with at least 4 matches and directly or up to 2 nt later the sequence YGT. Two pool 2b screens with element 2b were performed. The first for pool 2b sequences (pool 2b/T4) required the TTGYT with at least 3 matches, directly or up to 5 nt later followed by ATTTTACT(T/G) with at least 3 matches and directly or up to 2 nt later the sequence YCT. The second screen (pool 2b/T3) differed from pool 2b/T4 in that ATTTACT(T/G) with at least 3 matches was required instead of ATTTTACT(T/G). As a positive control, the pool M was screened for the presence of the consensus sequence for downstream elements YGTGTTYY proposed by McLaughlan et al. (8McLaughlan J. Gaffney D. Whitton J.L. Clements J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). No minimum number of matches was demanded for this screen. CstF was purified from calf thymus whole cell extracts and twice independently from HeLa cell nuclear extracts (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Fractions of the final poly(U)-Sepharose columns used for the selection of RNA ligands (see below) are shown in Fig.1 A. HeLa CstF consists of three polypeptides with molecular masses of 50, 64, and 77 kDa (Refs.27Gilmartin G.M. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2180-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Gilmartin G.M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2432-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Takagaki Y.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1711-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar; Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 3). CstF purified from calf thymus also contained the 50- and 77-kDa polypeptides but differed from HeLa CstF in that the 64-kDa subunit was much less abundant and contained an additional polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 70 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). To investigate whether this 70-kDa subunit represents an alternative form of the 64-kDa polypeptide, calf thymus and HeLa CstF were separated on high resolution SDS-polyacrylamide gels and either stained with silver (Fig. 1 B) or used for Western blot analysis and immunodetection with polyclonal antibodies raised against the human 64-kDa subunit (Fig. 1 C). On this gel, the 64-kDa subunit of HeLa CstF emerges as a doublet of 64 and 62 kDa and a significantly less abundant 66-kDa polypeptide (Ref. 30Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar; Fig. 1 B, lane 2). The 64-kDa subunit of calf thymus CstF is a doublet of 62 and 60 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Furthermore, a less abundant polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 52 kDa is visible (Fig.1 B, lane 1). Both 64-kDa doublets, the HeLa 66-kDa polypeptide and the calf thymus 52- and 70-kDa polypeptides, were recognized by the polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1 C). However, the monoclon"

https://openalex.org/W1968388788,"Rats learn a novel foraging pattern better with their right-side whiskers than with their left-side whiskers. They also learn better with the left cerebral hemisphere than with the right hemisphere. Rotating an already learned maze relative to the external environment most strongly reduces right-whisker performance; starting an already learned maze at a different location most strongly reduces left-whisker performance. These results suggest that the right-periphery–left-hemisphere system accesses a map-like representation of the foraging problem, whereas the left-periphery–right-hemisphere system accesses a rote path. Thus, as in humans, functional asymmetries in rats can be elicited by both peripheral and cortical manipulation, and each hemisphere makes qualitatively distinct contributions to a complex natural behavior."

Transcription of the GP63 genes is sensitive to α-amanitin, indicating that they are transcribed by a different polymerase than the variant surface glycoprotein genes.

During its life cycle, the trypanosomatid protozoan parasiteLeishmania exists as an extracellular form, the promastigote, in its sandfly vector and as an intracellular form, the amastigote, in macrophages of its mammalian host (1Pearson R.D. Wheeler D.A. Harrison L.H. Kay H.D. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: 907-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).

Leishmania GP63s and their genes have been the subject of extensive investigation and many reviews (5Bordier C. Parasitol.

These studies have included determinations of the structure and post-translational modifications of the protein, characterizations of its protease activity, and elucidations of the chromosomal organization and differential expression of the multicopy GP63 genes. Nascent GP63s have an N-terminal prepropeptide that must be removed for activation of the protease activity and most nascent GP63s have a C-terminal hydrophobic tail that is replaced by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (9Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the Leishmania species, infective (metacyclic) promastigotes can have as many as 500,000 GP63 molecules on their surface (7Medina-Acosta E. Beverley S.M. Russell D.G. Infect.

A number of different functions have been ascribed toLeishmania GP63s, several of which implicate GP63 in the interaction between the infective promastigote and the macrophage.

The presence of proteolytically active GP63 on the surface of promastigotes has also been correlated with resistance of the parasite to complement-mediated lysis (17Puentes S.M. Dwyer D.M. Bates P.A.

A homologue of Leishmania GP63 has been reported in another trypanosomatid, Crithidia fasciculata (24Inverso J.A. Medina-Acosta E. O'Connor J. Russell D.G. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). C. fasciculata is not known to infect a mammalian host. Its life cycle appears to be confined to mosquitoes, and it is thought to have two predominant developmental forms, one adhering to the lining of the insect's midgut and the other existing within the lumen of the gut (7Medina-Acosta E. Beverley S.M. Russell D.G. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 25-34PubMed Google Scholar,25Wallace F.G. Parasitol. Rev. 1966; 18: 124-193Google Scholar). A biological role for the C. fasciculata GP63 remains obscure. It might protect the organism from the immune response of the insect, it might be an evolutionary vestige of an era when C. fasciculata had another host, or it may have a function yet to be discovered. African trypanosomes are a third group of protozoan parasites that, similar to Leishmania, exist as one major developmental form in an insect vector and another in the mammalian host (26Vickerman K. Tetley L. Hendry K.A. Turner C.M. Biol. Cell. 1988; 64: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast to Leishmania, however, both of these forms are extracellular. In the tsetse fly midgut, African trypanosomes are present as an extracellular procyclic form, whereas in the bloodstream of their mammalian hosts, they exist as a free-swimming bloodstream form. Bloodstream trypanosomes evade their hosts' immune response by periodically switching their variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), a phenomenon called antigenic variation that has also been the subject of extensive investigation and many reviews (27Cross G.A.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 93-110Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 28Borst P. Rudenko G. Science. 1994; 264: 1872-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Vanhamme L. Pays E.

While comparing the efficiency of sequencing random genomic DNA fragments versus random cDNAs for discovering new genes in African trypanosomes, we identified a random genomic fragment,i.e. a genomic survey sequence (GSS), encoding a protein with similarity to GP63s of Leishmania andCrithidia (31El-Sayed N.M.A. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two random trypanosome cDNAs, or expressed sequence tags (ESTs), have also now been found to encode GP63-like proteins. 2P. Majiwa, personal communication. Thus, we undertook a characterization of the genes encoding these African trypanosome homologues of GP63. We found that the African trypanosome GP63 genes are predominantly expressed in the bloodstream form, leading us to hypothesize that the presence of GP63 protects bloodstream trypanosomes against complement-mediated lysis. All experiments were conducted with material isolated from the MVAT4 bloodstream clone of the Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense WRATat serodeme, or from procyclic organisms derived from an MVAT5 bloodstream clone of the same serodeme (32Alarcon C.M.

Parasitol. 1997; 84: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using conventional procedures (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts were rescued in the plasmid pBluescript.BamHI fragments from a genomic DNA insert of a λ FIX clone were subcloned into the same plasmid. DNA sequencing was conducted on an Applied Biosystems model 373A stretch fluorescent automated DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Known sequences were used to synthesize new oligonucleotides for further sequencing. The sequences were analyzed using the HIBIO MacIntosh DNASIS program (Hitachi) and the CLUSTAL algorithm (41Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). The African trypanosome GSS possessing similarity to GP63 genes (31El-Sayed N.M.A. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was used as a probe to screen cDNA and genomic DNA libraries derived from T. brucei rhodesiense bloodstream clone MVAT4 (32Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Positive clones were identified in both libraries, and several clones from each were selected for further characterization. Preliminary analyses of the cDNA clones revealed two that contain a complete coding region.Panel A of Fig. 1 depicts one of these cDNAs and the relative locations of the 5′ ends of the GSS and ESTs containing the sequence similarities. The complete sequences of the two cDNAs were determined and found to be identical except for a small difference in the locations of their 5′ ends within the 5′-untranslated region (UTR). Neither cDNA contains a 5′ spliced leader, but both have an upstream termination codon in frame with the first methionine codon. The protein encoded by this cDNA sequence is compared with theC. fasciculata GP63 sequence (24Inverso J.A. Medina-Acosta E. O'Connor J. Russell D.G. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and a GP63 sequence fromLeishmania guyanensis (42Steinkraus H.B. Greer J.M. Stephenson D.C. Langer P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in Fig.2. All of the publishedLeishmania GP63 sequences from several differentLeishmania species display significant homology to the African trypanosome sequence in a BLASTX search (data not shown) (43Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71436) Google Scholar), but the L. guyanensis GP63 shown in Fig. 2 has slightly more homology than the others. The shaded boxes show positions in the trypanosome sequence at which an identical amino acid occurs in theCrithidia and/or Leishmania sequence. Across the full 622-amino acid trypanosome sequence, 38% of the residues (235/622) are identical to the Crithidia and/orLeishmania GP63s. Between positions 114 and 425,i.e. within the middle one-half of the trypanosome protein, 50% of the positions (156/313) are identical to theCrithidia and/or Leishmania GP63s. Furthermore, the positions of 19 cysteine residues (black ovals) and 10 proline residues (black triangles) are conserved in all three sequences. Because cysteines are involved in potential disulfide linkages and prolines disrupt secondary structure, the conservation of these amino acid positions suggests that the three proteins have a similar overall tertiary structure. In the trypanosome protein, the longest stretch of amino acid identity with the Crithidia and/or Leishmania GP63s occurs at the 9 residues between positions 225–233, i.e.HEIAHALGF, a region known to be at the catalytic site of the zinc-protease activity of Leishmania GP63 (large open box in Fig. 2). This region contains 2 histidines and 1 glutamic acid that are conserved among all three sequences and have been shown to be essential for the protease activity (44McGwire B.S. Chang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7903-7909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Downstream of this protease site are several other 4- and 5-amino acid segments in the trypanosome protein that occur in the Crithidia and/orLeishmania GP63s. Less well conserved in the trypanosome protein is a sequence thought to be involved in macrophage binding,i.e. SRYD at positions 250–253 in the Leishmaniasequence shown in Fig. 2 (11Soteriadou K.P. Remoundos M.S. Katsikas M.D. Tzinia A.K. Tsikaris V. Sakarellos D. Tzartos S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13980-13985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because African trypanosomes are not known to interact directly with macrophages, it is not surprising that this sequence is not conserved. In general, the Crithidia and Leishmania GP63s are more similar to each other than either is to the trypanosome sequence, an observation expected from the fact that in phylogenetic trees deduced from sequences of cytochrome c or mitochondrial DNA, African trypanosomes are the most divergent of the three organisms (45Fernandes A.P. Nelson K. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11608-11612Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 46Landweber L.F. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The least similarity of the trypanosome protein with the Crithidia and/or LeishmaniaGP63s occurs in the first 50 and last 50 residues of the trypanosome sequence. However, near their N and C termini, all three proteins are notably hydrophobic. The first 50 residues of the trypanosome protein possess the hallmarks of a prepropeptide, as do theCrithidia and Leishmania GP63s. The potential N-terminal signal (pre)peptide in the trypanosome protein has a positively charged arginine at position 8, followed by a number of hydrophobic residues before the next charged residue, an aspartic acid at position 22. The potential propeptide segment of the trypanosome protein contains an Arg-Cys dipeptide thought to complex with zinc in the catalytic site of the latent form of Leishmania majorGP63 (7Medina-Acosta E. Beverley S.M. Russell D.G. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 25-34PubMed Google Scholar, 47Bouvier J. Schneider P. Etges R. Bordier C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10113-10119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). At its C terminus, the trypanosome protein terminates with a hydrophobic tail whose sequence is consistent with the possibility that this tail is replaced with a GPI anchor similar to most GP63s ofCrithidia and Leishmania (48Cross G.A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Immediately upstream of this hydrophobic tail is a very acidic, serine-rich region (overline in Fig. 2) that is less prominent in the corresponding Crithidia and Leishmania proteins shown in Fig. 2. However, other Leishmania GP63s not shown have similar acidic, serine-rich regions in the same location, suggesting that this motif may play a role in the functions of some, but not all, GP63 variants. Thus, the variety of amino acid similarities of this African trypanosome protein with Leishmania and CrithidiaGP63s indicates that it shares structural properties, and likely protease activity, with these other GP63s. On the basis of these amino acid similarities, and for the purpose of brevity, we will henceforth refer to this African trypanosome protein as GP63. Preliminary characterizations of several T. brucei genomic DNA clones that hybridized to the GSS indicated that all but one contained either one or two GP63 genes. However, one clone with a 14-kb insert was found to contain three adjacent GP63 genes and was chosen for further characterization (Fig. 1, panel B). BamHI fragments of 4.5 and 1.2 kb were subcloned from this insert and their complete sequences determined. The phage DNA itself was used as a template for PCR amplifications and further sequence determinations to verify that the 4.5-kb fragment is followed by the 1.2-kb fragment and to determine another 0.3 kb of downstream sequence. This 6.0 kb of sequence is denoted by the black region in panel B. The 6.0-kb sequence, along with additional Southern blots not shown, confirms the presence of three adjacent GP63 genes in this region and demonstrates that they do not share an identical sequence with each other or with the cDNA. Thus, the genome of this T. brucei clone contains a minimum of four GP63 genes, i.e. genes 1–4 indicated in Fig. 1 in which gene 1 gave rise to the cDNA sequence. The three genes in the cloned genomic DNA segment shown in Fig. 1 B are separated by intergenic regions of 124 and 1335 bp if the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of genes 2 and 3 are assumed to be about the same length as that of gene 1 (whose UTR lengths are known from the cDNA sequence). A sequence very similar to the 124-bp intergenic region occurs at the 3′ end of the 1335-bp intergenic region (results not shown), suggesting that this region might be the minimum segment necessary for precursor RNA processing events if the three genes are transcribed into a polycistronic precursor RNA, as are most tandemly repeated genes in Trypanosomatids (49Ramamoorthy R. Swihart K.G. McCoy J.J. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12133-12139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Panel C of Fig. 1 shows a Southern blot of trypanosome genomic DNA digested with several restriction enzymes and probed with the GP63 cDNA shown in panel A. This probe hybridizes to seven BamHI fragments, four of which are derived from the genomic region shown in panel B, i.e., the 4.5- and 1.2-kb fragments (arrows in panel C) and two flanking BamHI fragments of unknown length. One of the additional BamHI fragments must contain GP63 gene 1 (whose cDNA does not have an internal BamHI site). The other two BamHI fragments likely contain at least one more GP63 gene, but no attempt was made to determine unambiguously the exact number of GP63 genes per haploid genome. All of these genes are likely clustered on one or two chromosomes inasmuch as they appear to be confined to two large EcoRI fragments (lane E ofpanel C). The multiple number of BglII,EcoRV, and PstI fragments hybridizing to the cDNA probe is consistent with the many polymorphisms observed in the four GP63 genes for which complete or partial sequence was obtained. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the GP63s encoded by gene 1 (as deduced from the cDNA) and gene 3, the two trypanosome GP63 genes for which the complete coding sequence was determined. Amino acid substitutions, and occasional small deletions/additions, are scattered throughout most of the alignment. The largest difference occurs just before the C-terminal hydrophobic tails, where GP63-1, but not GP63-3, contains the highly acidic, serine-rich region (overline in Fig. 3) mentioned above. This region in GP63-3 contains some serines, but it is neither as long nor as acidic as in GP63-1, and it actually resembles the corresponding region in Crithidia GP63 (Fig. 2) more than GP63-1. The putative protease zinc-binding/catalytic site (open box) is the same in GP63-1 and -3. In contrast to the scattered amino acid replacements between these two T. brucei GP63s, the amino acid differences among the multiple GP63s of Leishmania chagasi are confined to four or five specific regions (50Roberts S.C. Swihart K.G. Agey M.W. Ramamoorthy R. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The significance of this different distribution in amino acid changes among the GP63s of these two organisms is not known, but it could reflect differing functions of GP63s in the different organisms. Fig.4 shows Northern blots of RNAs from bloodstream and procyclic trypanosomes probed with the trypanosome GP63 cDNA and, as control hybridizations, with cDNAs encoding the expressed VSG, procyclin, and tubulin. The GP63 cDNA hybridizes strongly to a 3-kb RNA in bloodstream trypanosomes and only weakly to the same sized RNA in procyclic trypanosomes. The 3-kb size is consistent with the 2786 nucleotides in the GP63-1 cDNA and with the sizes of GP63 mRNAs in Lieshmania andCrithidia (24Inverso J.A. Medina-Acosta E. O'Connor J. Russell D.G. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 51Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. Paetz K.E. Maybodi M. Roberts S.C. Wilson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1888-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the VSG and procyclin cDNAs hybridize predominantly to the bloodstream and procyclic RNAs, respectively, and the tubulin cDNA hybridizes about equally to both RNAs, indicating similar amounts of RNA were added to each lane. The ratio of the GP63 signals in the bloodstreamversus procyclic RNA lanes was determined by electronic autoradiography to be at about 50:1. The ratio of the GP63 and VSG signals in bloodstream RNA was not determined because the two radioactive 32P-probes may have had differing specific activities. However, in a duplicate screening of the T. brucei bloodstream MVAT4 cDNA library, about 1 GP63 cDNA clone was detected for every 150 VSG cDNA clones. Thus, if the ratio of the two cDNA species in this amplified cDNA library reflects the levels of their corresponding mRNAs, the ratio of GP63 mRNA to VSG mRNA in bloodstream trypanosomes is about 1:150. Although this ratio of mRNA levels cannot be extrapolated to an estimate of the number of GP63 proteins in bloodstream trypanosomes, it may still be worth noting that 1/150th of the 107 VSGs on the surface of a bloodstream trypanosome (52Turner M.J. Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is 67,000, or about one-sixth the maximum of 500,000 GP63 molecules on the surface of infective promastigotes of some Leishmania species (7Medina-Acosta E. Beverley S.M. Russell D.G. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 25-34PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on transcription experiments have been used to demonstrate that the active telomere-linked VSG gene is transcribed in bloodstream trypanosomes, but not in procyclic trypanosomes (29Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, many tandemly repeated genes in Trypanosomatids, including GP63 genes inLeishmania, are transcribed at all stages of the organisms' life cycles, and their steady state mRNA levels are determined by post-transcriptional regulatory events (reviewed in Refs. 29Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 53Clayton C. Moldave K. Cohn W. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1992: 37-66Google Scholar). To determine whether the bloodstream expression of the GP63 genes in African trypanosomes is regulated at the level of transcription (similar to VSG genes) or at a post-transcriptional step (similar to most other Trypanosomatid genes), we conducted similar nuclear run-on experiments. Radiolabeled run-on RNAs from nuclei of procyclic and bloodstream trypanosomes were used to probe the GP63 cDNA.Panel B of Fig. 5 shows the results when procyclic run-on RNA was used as the probe. As expected, procyclic RNA hybridizes to the procyclin and tubulin genes but not to the VSG gene. It also hybridizes with a strong signal to GP63 gene 1. Thus, GP63 RNA is synthesized in procyclic organisms, even though they contain very little mature GP63 mRNA detectable on Northern blots.Panels C and D of Fig. 5 show a similar experiment using run-on RNA from bloodstream MVAT4 nuclei in absence or presence of α-amanitin. Transcription from the VSG and procyclin gene expression sites is known to be resistant to α-amanitin, suggesting that these expression sites are transcribed by RNA polymerase I or a modified RNA polymerase II (54Rudenko G. Chung H.-M.M. Pham V.P. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3387-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 55Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. Kieft R. Borst P. Nature. 1991; 353: 772-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the absence of α-amanitin (panel C), nascent RNA from bloodstream nuclei hybridizes strongly to the MVAT4 VSG gene and more weakly to the tubulin and GP63 genes. Thus, the single MVAT4 VSG gene is transcribed at a much higher rate than are the multiple GP63s, consistent with the 1:150 ratio of their respective cDNAs in the MVAT 4 cDNA library. The trace-level hybridization to the procyclin gene observed here has been reported previously (56Pays E. Coquelet H. Tebabi P. Pays A. Jefferies D. Steinert M. Koenig E. Williams R.O. Roditi I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3145-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 57Rudenko G. Bishop D. Gottesdiener K. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4259-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When α-amanitin was present during the bloodstream nuclei incubation (panel D), transcription of the VSG and procyclin genes was unaffected, but transcription of the genes for tubulin and GP63 was nearly abolished, indicating that the GP63 genes are transcribed by a conventional RNA polymerase II, similar to the tubulin genes, but distinct from VSG and procyclin genes. Although a weaker signal is obtained to the GP63 gene in bloodstreamversus procyclic forms, electronic autoradiography revealed that the ratio of the GP63 and tubulin transcripts remains constant (results not shown), indicating that the levels of transcription of GP63 are the same in both developmental stages and that the differential steady state mRNA levels observed are due to post-transcriptional regulatory events. Despite the numerous studies devoted to LeishmaniaGP63s since their discovery, the potential functions of this family of surface proteases and the identities of their substrates in vivo remain subjects of speculation (7Medina-Acosta E. Beverley S.M. Russell D.G. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 25-34PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bouvier J. Schneider P. Etges R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 614-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The identification of an expressed GP63-like gene in C. fasciculata (24Inverso J.A. Medina-Acosta E. O'Connor J. Russell D.G. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a trypanosomatid whose life cycle is confined to insects, suggests that one of the main roles of GP63 for Leishmania occurs during the parasite's insect stages. Supporting this possibility is the finding that another protozoan parasite of insects, Herpetomonas samuelpessoai, also has a GP63-like metalloprotease activity on its surface (58Schneider P. Glaser T.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 59Etges R. Acta Trop. 1992; 50: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, several other studies suggest that GP63 is crucial for the intracellular existence of Leishmania in its mammalian host. These investigations indicate that GP63 participates in the attachment and entry of Leishmania into host macrophages and contributes to its survival within the macrophage (reviewed in Refs. 7Medina-Acosta E. Beverley S.M. Russell D.G. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 25-34PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bouvier J. Schneider P. Etges R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 614-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, and 44McGwire B.S. Chang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7903-7909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All Leishmania species examined have at least six tandem copies of closely related genes encoding slightly different GP63 proteins, and some species have more than 20 tandem GP63 genes (7Medina-Acosta E. Beverley S.M. Russell D.G. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 25-34PubMed Google Scholar, 42Steinkraus H.B. Greer J.M. Stephenson D.C. Langer P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 60Szarfman A. Luquetti A. Rassi A. Rezende J.M. Schmunis G.A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1981; 30: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The simplest interpretation of all these biochemical and molecular biology studies may be that the multiple GP63s serve a variety of functions throughout theLeishmania life cycle. The identification of GP63-like genes in African trypanosomes leads to a further consideration of the potential functions of GP63, inasmuch as African trypanosomes are not known to interact with macrophages or to have a natural intracellular stage during the life cycle involving humans and the tsetse fly. Likewise, the expression of GP63 predominantly in bloodstream trypanosomes is counter to what one might expect, based on the detection of GP63s on the surface of the insect-specific protozoa, C. fasciculata and H. samuelpessoai. It is worth mentioning, however, that in experimental infections of rats and mice with Trypanosoma brucei brucei, intracellular parasites have been reported to occur in the epithelium (ependymal cells) that covers the choroid plexus and constitutes the local blood-brain barrier (61Abolarin M.O. Evans D.A. Tovey D.G. Ormerod W.E. Br. Med. J. 1982; 285: 1380-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 62Ormerod W.E. Hussein M.S.-A. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1986; 80: 626-633Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 63Abolarin M.O. Stamford S.A. Ormerod W.E. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1986; 80: 618-625Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although, to our knowledge, the existence of an intracellular form of African trypanosomes has not been reconfirmed since the original reports in 1982–1986, this observation might be of significance in considering a potential role for GP63 when the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier. The nuclear run-on assays (Fig. 5) indicated that the GP63 genes are transcribed in both procyclic and bloodstream trypanosomes by an α-amanitin-sensitive RNA polymerase, in contrast to the expressed VSG gene, which is transcribed exclusively in bloodstream forms by an α-amanitin-resistant polymerase. However, Northern blots showed that the GP63 mRNAs accumulate to a detectable steady-state level only in bloodstream trypanosomes, as do VSG mRNAs. In the case of VSG mRNAs, their semiconserved 3′-UTRs are important in conferring the bloodstream stage specificity to the VSG mRNAs (64Berberof M. Vanhamme L. Tebabi P. Pays A. Jefferies D. Welburn S. Pays E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A multiple alignment of the three 3′-UTRs of the sequenced trypanosome GP63 genes revealed a high level of homology in those regions. Our attempts to identify substantive sequence similarities in the 3′-UTR sequences of several expressed VSG genes and these three GP63 3′-UTRs were not particularly revealing; however, a sequence resemblance to a 14-mer element conserved in all VSG mRNAs was observed immediately upstream of the polyadenylation site of the GP63 genes. The presence of this 14-mer element has been shown to be necessary, but not sufficient, for VSG gene regulation (64Berberof M. Vanhamme L. Tebabi P. Pays A. Jefferies D. Welburn S. Pays E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Many questions remain about the location and differential expression of GP63s in African trypanosomes, and the results described here provide the basis from which to deduce their possible functions. The sequence conservation of the region known to be at the catalytic site of the zinc-protease activity and the complete conservation of 19 cysteines and 10 prolines (see Fig. 2) suggest that the GP63 protease activity does indeed contribute to the survival of the bloodstream stage of African trypanosomes. Although we have not yet shown that this trypanosome protein is a membrane-bound, proteolytically active, homologue of Leishmania GP63, we anticipate that a demonstration of zinc-protease activity in the native or recombinant protein will be forthcoming. An attractive possible function for GP63 in African trypanosomes is to mediate their known resistance to complement-mediated lysis. Devine et al. (65Devine D.V. Falk R.J. Balber A.E. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 223-229Crossref Google Scholar) showed that, whereas bloodstream trypanosomes activate the alternative pathway of complement in human serum, they are not lysed because the complement cascade does not go beyond establishment of C3 convertase on the parasite surface. In their study, the trypanosomes displayed high levels of C3 deposition as well as factor B on their surface. Similar results demonstrating interrupted complement fixation onLeishmania promastigotes expressing high levels of GP63 were reported recently (18Brittingham A. Morrison C.J. McMaster W.R. McGwire B.S. Chang K.-P. Mosser D.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3102-3111PubMed Google Scholar). A test of the complement resistance model in African trypanosomes will be to overexpress GP63 in bloodstream trypanosomes to see whether their resistance to complement-mediated lysis is increased, and to see whether procyclic trypanosomes engineered to express GP63 acquire resistance (procyclic T. brucei is susceptible to complement-mediated cytolysis; Ref.66Mosser D.M. Roberts J.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 54: 310-316Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, the amount of GP63 on the surface of severalLeishmania species has been shown to increase as much as 11-fold when promastigotes develop in culture from logarithmic forms to a stationary infective “metacyclic” form (51Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. Paetz K.E. Maybodi M. Roberts S.C. Wilson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1888-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 67Weider M.K. Lemesre J.L. Santoro F. Kusnierz J.P. Sadigursky M. Capron A. Parasite Immunol. 1989; 11: 197-209Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that GP63 is also highly expressed in metacyclic African trypanosomes, the infective form of the parasite that first comes in contact with the immune system. Consistent with this possibility is a preliminary report of a 65-kDa membrane-bound metalloprotease in infective metacyclic trypomastigotes ofTrypanosoma cruzi (68Salles J.M. Thomas N. Carreira Fragoso M.A. Goldenberg S. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 1996; 91: 269Google Scholar), an intracellular parasite that causes Chagas disease in Latin America and must also evade complement-mediated lysis before entering host cells.

To characterize this defect, we expressed wild-type and mutant cDNAs in Escherichia coli as the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, with purification by affinity chromatography. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis for wild-type and mutant fusion proteins indicated an expected molecular mass of 42–43 kDa. Kinetic characterization of the wild-type fusion protein yieldedK m values of 150 ± 23 and 440 ± 190 μm (mean ± S.E.) for substrates (RS)-mevalonate and ATP, respectively. Expressed wild-type mevalonate kinase (MKase) had a maximum velocity of 13.6 ± 1.4 units/mg of protein (n = 22, ±S.E.), whereas the A334T mutation yielded an enzyme with averageV max of 0.26 ± 0.02 unit/mg of protein (n = 6, ±S.E.), representing a decrease to 1.4% of control V max. Restriction digestion withHhaI, in conjunction with direct sequencing of cDNAs, revealed that two patients were homozygous and one heterozygous for the A334T allele, establishing autosomal recessive inheritance within families. Although the A334T enzyme had a normal K m for ATP of 680 ± 226 μm (n = 3, ±S.E.), the Michaelis constant for (RS)-mevalonate was increased >30-fold to 4623 ± 1167 μm(n = 4, ±S.E.) under standard assay conditions. Comparable kinetic results were obtained using extracts of lymphoblasts, which were homozygous for the A334T allele. Alanine 334 is invariant in MKase from bacteria to man and located in a glycine-rich region postulated to have homology with ATP-binding sequences. Our results indicate that the bacterial expression system for human MKase will provide a useful model system in which to analyze inherited mutations and identify the first active site residue in MKase associated with stabilization of mevalonate binding. Sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNAs from cultured cells of three patients with mevalonate kinase deficiency revealed a G → A transversion at nucleotide 1000 of the coding region, converting alanine to threonine at position 334 (A334T). To characterize this defect, we expressed wild-type and mutant cDNAs in Escherichia coli as the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, with purification by affinity chromatography. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis for wild-type and mutant fusion proteins indicated an expected molecular mass of 42–43 kDa.

Inborn errors of human metabolism have served as useful sources of information, which have elucidated normal pathways of intermediary metabolism. Although the majority of these genetic diseases occur in catabolic pathways, several have been identified in well regulated anabolic pathways, such as the pathway of cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoid biosynthesis. Recent work has identified three inherited defects within this pathway, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, desmosterolosis, and mevalonic aciduria due to mevalonate kinase (MKase) 1The abbreviations used are: MKase, mevalonate kinase; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SLO, Smith-Lemli-Opitz. 1The abbreviations used are: MKase, mevalonate kinase; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SLO, Smith-Lemli-Opitz. deficiency (1Salen G.

Of these three defects, the former two occur beyond the branch point to isoprenoid biosynthesis at the level of farnesyl diphosphate and are therefore unique to sterol and bile acid biosynthesis. Conversely, MKase deficiency occurs just after the highly regulated step of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and, therefore, represents a defect potentially affecting both steroid and isoprene biosynthesis.Mevalonate occupies a central role in intermediary metabolism and is an important precursor of membrane biogenesis, hormone production, protein glycosylation (dolichols), respiration (ubiquinone), and protein biosynthesis (isopentenylated transfer RNAs) (4Goldstein J.L.

Jabalquinto A.M. Beytia E. Int. J. Biochem. 1979; 10: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The importance of maintaining mevalonate homeostasis is apparent in patients with MKase deficiency, who suffer an often fatal, multisystemic disease and excrete significant amounts of mevalonic acid in physiologic fluids (3Hoffmann G.F.

In human hepatocytes transfected with recombinant mevalonate kinase that has been induced to overexpress, cell cycle regulation is altered with concomitant increase in cellular transformation, presumably occurring through aberrant signal transduction (7Graef E.

There has been little attention focused on the genes directly involved in early mevalonate disposition, even though these genes also appear to be regulated. The activity of MKase in animal liver fluctuates in response to feeding with cholesterol and cholesterol deprivation (11Jabalquinto A.M. Cardemil E. Arch. Biochem.

Evidence indicates that these fluctuations are paralleled by changes in MKase mRNA quantities, suggesting that regulation occurs at the transcriptional level (12Tanaka R.D. Lee L.Y. Schafer B.L.

In addition, MKase may be regulated post-translationally through feedback inhibition by farnesyl diphosphate and potentially other nonsterol isoprenes (13Hinson D.D. Chambliss K.L. Toth M.J.

Despite these observations and a critical role in the control of mevalonate metabolism, little is known about the mechanisms through which MKase achieves catalysis or how regulation occurs at the gene and protein level.In the current report, we describe the identification of a novel mutation in MKase deficiency, detected in three patients from two families. The nucleotide transversion results in substitution of threonine for invariant alanine at position 334 of the polypeptide sequence, within a region of strict sequence conservation for MKase in six species from bacteria to man. Expression of the mutant protein inEscherichia coli results in production of a protein with a decrease to 1.4% of control V max in comparison with the wild-type recombinant enzyme and a >30-fold increase inK m for substrate (RS)-mevalonate.

Furthermore, the interaction of the C1 factor with a number of cellular proteins and transcription factors suggests that it is a significant component of the regulation complexes of cellular genes. 3J. Vogel and T. Kristie, unpublished data. 3J. Vogel and T. Kristie, unpublished data. One of the key issues in the regulation of HSV gene expression concerns the biochemical mechanism(s) which determine the lytic-latent life cycle of the virus. Following a primary infection, an individual harbors the viral genome in the neurons of the sensory (trigeminal/sacral) ganglia where it remains in a latent state until complex stimuli induce reactivation and viral replication (reviewed in Ref. 2Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1043-1107Google Scholar). Although little is known about the factors involved in determining the latent-lytic states of the virus, the expression of the α/IE genes may represent a critical regulatory point in this process. Specifically, C1-dependent modulation of the viral cycle is an attractive model as the factor consists of a set of proteolytic forms and modification states that would enable it to effectively regulate the latent-lytic switch, it has a critical role in the regulation of HSV IE gene expression, and it is involved in basic cellular processes. As no tissue culture system faithfully represents a latent HSV infection, studies have focused upon the use of recombinant viruses and transgenes in the mouse model system (reviewed in Ref. 2Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1043-1107Google Scholar). To develop a genetic system to analyze the role of the C1 factor in cellular processes and in the regulation of the latent-lytic cycle of HSV, the forms and function of the mouse C1 homologue have been characterized. cDNAs and genomic clones which encode this protein were isolated and demonstrate that the mouse homologue is nearly identical to the human factor. Interestingly, in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of the C1 factor in cultured cells (24Kristie T.M. Pomerantz J.L. Twomey T.C. Parent S.A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the differential expression of the C1 polypeptide(s) in human and mouse tissues may account for the tissue tropism of HSV in these two organisms.

New Zealand White rabbits were inoculated with SDS-PAGE purified GST-FL29 (Ab2157) or GST-FL150.2 (Ab2159) protein according to standard procedures (30Harlow E. Lane D.

The resulting immune seras were antigen affinity-purified as described previously (24Kristie T.M. Pomerantz J.L. Twomey T.C. Parent S.A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts from HeLa, NA-AJ11, RMA, and P815 cells were prepared as described previously (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). 20 μg of each extract were resolved in a 7.5% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 30:0.8), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with affinity-purified anti-human C1 antibody (AB2125) as described elsewhere (24Kristie T.M.

Protein extracts from tissues of 7-week-old BALBc mice were prepared by homogenization of 0.5 g of tissue in 2 ml of t-ext buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmEDTA, 20 μg ml−1 RNase A, “complete” protease inhibitor (aprotinin, leupeptin, Pefabloc, EDTA; Boehringer Mannheim) in a tissue grinder using a Teflon pestle attached to a variable speed drill. The homogenates were incubated on ice for 15 min and subsequently cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 20 min. Human tissue extracts were purchased fromCLONTECH. As various tissues contain a disproportionate level of specific proteins (i.e. actin in muscle tissues, neurofilaments in neural tissues), protein extracts were equalized according the representation of several common proteins. Replicate sets of equivalent amounts of protein from mouse or human tissues were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon, and probed with affinity-purified antibodies directed against the amino terminus (Ab2157 and Ab2159), the PPS domain (Ab2131) (24Kristie T.M.

The blots were developed for chemiluminescent detection according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pierce). Transfer efficiency was monitored by staining the membrane with Coomassie Brilliant Blue prior to blotting as described previously (32LeGendre N. Matsudaira P. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 49-69Google Scholar). Human and mouse multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH (human 7760-1: heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas; human II 7759-1: spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, peripheral blood leukocyte; human fetal II 7756-1: brain, lung, liver, kidney; mouse 7762-1: heart brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, testis; mouse embryo 7763-1: 7-, 11-, 15-, and 17-day). DNA probes (human: cDNA clones FL29, FL150.2, H10; mouse: cDNA clones 53.11, 53.14, 5c.8; control: human β-actin cDNA) were prepared by labeling of the appropriate cDNA fragments with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mm) using random hexamer primers (Pharmacia). The blots were prehybridized, hybridized with 2.0 × 106 cpm/ml of the appropriate DNA probe, and washed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. C1 and β-actin hybridization signals were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Hybridization probes derived from the amino terminus (FL29), middle (FL53, FL150.2, and FL191.1), or carboxyl terminus (PB5c and H10) of the human C1 factor were prepared by isolation of the appropriate cDNA clone DNA fragments and labeling with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mm) using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Boehringer Mannheim) and random hexamer primers (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Overlapping cDNAs were isolated by successive screenings of a mouse fetal liver λ gt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH) using the appropriate human cDNA probe mixture. Nytran (Amersham Corp.) filter lifts were prepared for hybridization according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The filters were irradiated in a Stratagene UV-linker; baked for 30 min at 80 °C; rinsed in 3 × SSC (SSC, 150 mm NaCl, 17 mm sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 25 °C for 45 min and at 55 °C for 60 min; prehybridized in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 125 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 12 h and hybridized in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 125 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 75 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 2.0 × 106 cpm/ml of the appropriate probe mixture at 42 °C for 12–16 h. The filters were subsequently washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 25 °C for 30 min and three times at 68 °C for 30 min. cDNA inserts from positive phage were subcloned into pBSK (Stratagene), and both strands were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method (33Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) at 45 °C (Sequenase 2.0, Amersham Corp.). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the C1 factor clones (GenBankTM accession no.U53925) were compared with the human homologue using the BLAST network service (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information and MacVector software (IBI-Kodak). Genomic clones 5341 (address 144) and 5342 (address 250) were isolated from an arranged mouse ES cell genomic P1 phage library (Genome Systems) using polymerase chain reaction primers M.C1.5′ (5′-CCAACATGGCCGGGCAGCATG-3′) and M.C1.3′ (5′-CTGCCCGCATTGGAGGTAGTG-3′) derived from the mouse cDNA sequence. The genomic DNA inserts were digested withBamHI, subcloned in pBSK, and sequenced by dye termination cycle sequencing (ABI PRISM, Perkin Elmer) using an ABI model 540 according to the manufacturer's recommendations (GenBankTMaccession no. U80821). DNAs from the mouse genomic clones 5341 and 5342 were labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation, combined with sheared mouse genomic DNA, and hybridized to male embryonic stem cell metaphase chromosomes in 2 × SSC, 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate (Genome Systems). Hybridization signals were detected by incubation in fluoresceinated anti-digoxigenin antibodies followed by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole counterstain. Eighty metaphase chromosomes were analyzed with 72 exhibiting specific labeling. The specific chromosomal location was determined by cohybridization of 5341/5342 DNA probes with a probe that is specific for the centromeric region of the X chromosome. Ten specifically hybridized X chromosomes were measured to determine the position of the 5341/5342 signal from the telomere/heterochromatic-euchromatic boundary. C1 (HCF) is a unique transcription factor due both to the unusual specific proteolytic processing that gives rise to the family of polypeptides as well as its participation in the regulation of processes such as RNA polymerase II-directed transcription and cell cycle control. However, little is known concerning the biochemical role of this protein in these processes due to the ubiquitous expression of the factor in cultured cells and to the lack of an appropriate genetic system. To develop a genetic system to analyze the role of the C1 factor in cellular functions and in the lytic-latent cycle of herpes simplex virus infection, cDNAs and genomic DNAs that encode the mouse C1 factor have been isolated and characterized. The human C1 factor consists of a family of polypeptides ranging from 68 to 230 kDa that are derived from a common precursor protein (23Wilson A.C. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W. Cell. 1993; 74: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 24Kristie T.M. Pomerantz J.L. Twomey T.C. Parent S.A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol.

To determine if these polypeptides are conserved in the mouse, nuclear extracts of HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), NA-AJ11 (mouse neural), RMA (mouse lymphoid), and P815 (mouse lymphoid) cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with affinity-purified anti-human C1 sera (Fig. 1, left panel). As shown, the sera specifically reacted with the family of C1 polypeptides in the HeLa (lane 1) and mouse cell extracts (lanes 2–4), illustrating the conservation of the processed C1 factor forms. The function of the mouse C1 factor in the assembly of an α/IE enhancer complex was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay in the presence of the HSV αTIF and the human Oct-1 proteins. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (right panel), the addition of the affinity-purified Oct-1 protein to a DNA binding reaction containing the HSVα0 DNA probe resulted in the formation of the Oct-1-DNA complex (lane 1), while a reaction containing Oct-1, αTIF, and the purified human C1 factor generated the characteristic C1 complex (H-C1, lane 2). Similarly, the addition of mouse nuclear extract derived from P815 cells to a reaction containing the human Oct-1 and αTIF proteins generated a stable C1 complex (M-C1, lane 3). The formation of the M-C1 complex was strictly dependent upon the inclusion of αTIF in the reaction and was not formed using HSVα0 mutant probes (data not shown). Furthermore, addition of Ab2125 to the M-C1 reaction specifically retarded the mobility of the C1 complex (lane 4), in contrast to the addition of control anti-GST antibodies (data not shown). It should be noted that the difference in mobility between the human and mouse C1 complexes (lanes 2 and3) is due to the particular C1 factor cleavage products that are present in the two preparations. Whereas the mouse P815 nuclear extract contains the complete family of proteins (68–230 kDa), the purified human C1 factor consists primarily of the 68- and 100–123- kDa C1 polypeptides (24Kristie T.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6525-6534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the mouse C1 factor were isolated from a λ gt10 mouse fetal liver library by hybridization with the human C1 factor cDNA (Fig.2, top) (23Wilson A.C.

As illustrated in Fig.3, the predicted amino acid sequence of the mouse C1 factor is nearly identical (96% amino acid identity) to the human with the exception of a region of relatively high divergence within the central domain of the protein. Most significantly, the mouse ORF contains eight reiterations of the 20-amino acid sequence that represent the sites of specific proteolytic processing that generates the family of C1 factor polypeptides (PPS) (24Kristie T.M.

As shown, the consensus sequence for the mouse PPS is identical to that which was derived from the six human processing sites (23Wilson A.C. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W.

Therefore, P1 phage containing the mouse genomic C1 gene were identified in an arranged library by polymerase chain reaction. Two recombinant phage (5341 and 5342) were subcloned and sequenced. The 25-kilobase pair deduced genomic structure of the C1 gene ORF (Fig.4) is comprised of 26 exons with an unusually large single exon (501-amino acid/1503-nucleotide) encoding the entire C1 factor proteolytic processing domain. The P1 genomic clones subsequently were used to determine the chromosomal location of the C1 factor gene by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. As shown in Fig.5, hybridization of mouse metaphase chromosomes with 5341/5342 resulted in specific labeling of the third largest chromosome (X chromosome). The identity of the chromosome was confirmed and the location of the C1 gene within band XC1 was determined by cohybridization of 5341/5342 with a probe that was specific for the centromeric region of the X chromosome. The C1 factor has been detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot in nuclei of many cultured or transformed human cell lines2(24Kristie T.M. Pomerantz J.L. Twomey T.C. Parent S.A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4387-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear that the polypeptides are stably expressed in all primary tissue types (35Wilson A.C. Parrish J.E. Massa H.F. Nelson D.L. Trask B.J. Herr W. Genomics. 1995; 25: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the expression of the C1 factor in human tissues, equivalent amounts of protein from total extracts of representative human tissues (heart, brain, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, lung, and testis) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a mixture of affinity-purified anti-C1 antiseras (Fig.6, top right panel). Although the factor was detected in extracts of human heart, liver, kidney, and testis, the polypeptides were not found in extracts of brain, skeletal muscle, or lung, suggesting that the protein is not normally expressed ubiquitously. It should be noted that only a subset of the processed C1 factor polypeptides (100- and 125–135-kDa forms) are detected in these particular tissue extracts, likely due to the manner in which they were prepared. 4T. Kristie, unpublished observations. The mouse represents an important animal model system for human infection by herpes simplex virus (reviewed in Ref. 2Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1043-1107Google Scholar). However, there are distinct differences in the infection tropism between these two organisms (see “Discussion) (reviewed in Refs. 2Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1043-1107Google Scholar and 37Whitley R.J. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2297-2342Google Scholar). To determine if the expression of the C1 factor polypeptides correlates with this difference, replicate extracts from select mouse tissues (heart, brain, lung, spleen, and thymus; Fig. 6, left panels) were blotted with antisera directed against the amino terminus (NH2), the proteolytic processing domain (PPSD), or the carboxyl terminus (COOH) of the human C1 factor. In contrast to the human, the C1 factor polypeptides were detected in all of the tested mouse extracts. To control for differences in the mouse and human extracts, duplicate titrations of both brain extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-C1 or with anti-neurofilament p200 sera. While the human extract clearly contains a significantly higher level (>10 fold) of the neurofilament p200, the C1 factor polypeptides are detected only in the mouse extract (Fig. 6, bottom right panel). This expression difference is further emphasized by quantitative Northern blot analyses of mouse and human tissue mRNA where C1 mRNA was significantly more abundant in mouse but not human neural tissues (Fig.7, left). Interestingly, quantitative comparison of fetal and adult C1 mRNA levels suggests that the C1 factor mRNA is more highly expressed in early developmental stages (Fig. 7, right). C1 (HCF) is a unique transcription factor that consists of a family of polypeptides which are involved in the regulated assembly of the herpes simplex virus α/IE gene enhancer complex by direct interaction with αTIF and Oct-1. In addition, the protein has recently been implicated in the control of cell cycle suggesting that C1 is involved in a number of basic cellular processes. To develop a mouse genetic system for the analysis of the role of C1 (HCF) in cell and viral functions, cDNAs and genomic DNAs have been isolated which encode the mouse C1 factor homologue. As suggested by the conservation of epitopes and functional assembly of a C1 complex, the mouse C1 factor is nearly identical to the human (94% amino acid identity/96.0% amino acid similarity). Most significantly, the mouse factor contains the identical 20 amino acid repeats which are the sites of specific proteolytic processing to generate the family of C1 polypeptides. Although the actual function of the processing of the C1 factor remains unknown, the series of amino- and carboxyl-terminal products remain tightly associated,2suggesting that the processing is a novel mechanism by which the function or activity of the protein is regulated. The high level of conservation of these sites in the mouse C1 factor suggests that this processing is critical to the function of the factor. In support of this, data from two-hybrid analyses have indicated that the PPS are not simply sites of specific proteolytic processing but are also sites for protein interactions with other cellular proteins.3 As illustrated in Figs. 3 and 8, C. elegans also contains a gene that is homologous to the human and mouse C1 factors. This homologue has a striking alignment to the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal portions of the mammalian factors. It, however, is a significantly smaller protein that lacks the central region and the processing domain of the human and mouse factors, suggesting that its functions may be more limited than the mammalian counterparts. Interestingly, the elegans homologue retains the amino-terminal domain of the C1 factor which has been implicated in the control of cell cycle (29Goto H. Motomura S. Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Nakabeppu Y. Fukushima K. Fujishima M. Herr W. Nishimoto T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) but lacks the mammalian C1 factor domains which are involved in the interaction with several transcription factors,3 suggesting that these functions are not interdependent. After a primary infection with herpes simplex virus, the virus remains in a latent state in the sensory ganglia (trigeminal, sacral) until stimulated to enter a reactivated replication mode (reviewed in Ref. 2Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1043-1107Google Scholar). However, the biochemical mechanism(s) by which the latent/lytic cycle is regulated are largely unknown, primarily due to the fact that HSV does not establish latent infections in tissue culture systems. As the α/IE genes of herpes simplex virus encode factors that are required for the progression of the viral lytic cycle, the regulation of this gene class could represent a significant point in the lytic/latent decision. The C1 factor provides a striking key target for regulation of the viral lytic/latent cycle due to its regulated interaction with the components of the HSV α/IE enhancer complex and its role in the control of cell cycle. Furthermore, the difference in the expression of the C1 factor in human and mouse brains correlates with the observed ability of the virus to productively replicate in this tissue type as evidenced by the significantly different frequency of viral encephalitis in these organisms following central nervous system infection (reviewed in Refs. 2Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1043-1107Google Scholar and 37Whitley R.J. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2297-2342Google Scholar). Most significantly, studies of the expression and localization of the C1 factor polypeptides in mouse trigeminal ganglia indicate that the protein is specifically activated by stimuli which induce the reactivation of herpes simplex virus from the latent state. 5A. Sears and T. Kristie, manuscript in preparation. As studies of the events which determine latency or reactivation of HSV are restricted to animal model systems, the characterization of the mouse C1 factor allows for the development of a genetic system to investigate the role of this protein in viral as well as cellular processes.
