https://openalex.org/W2102088119,"Human diploid fibroblasts eventually lose the capacity to replicate in culture and enter a viable but nonproliferative state of senescence. Recently, it has been demonstrated that retroviral-mediated gene transfer into primary fibroblasts of an activated <i>ras</i> gene (<i>V12ras</i>) rapidly accelerates development of the senescent phenotype. Using this<i>in vitro</i> system, we have sought to define the mediators of Ras-induced senescence. We demonstrate that expression of V12Ras results in an increase in intracellular and in particular, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. The ability of V12Ras to induce growth arrest and senescence is shown to be partially inhibited by coexpression of an activated <i>rac1</i> gene. A more dramatic rescue of V12Ras-expressing cells is demonstrated when the cells are placed in a low oxygen environment, a condition in which reactive oxygen species production is inhibited. In addition, in a 1% oxygen environment, Ras is unable to trigger an increase in the level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 or to activate the senescent program. Under normoxic (20% O<sub>2</sub>) conditions, the V12Ras senescent phenotype is demonstrated to be unaffected by scavengers of superoxide but rescued by scavengers of hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest that in normal diploid cells, Ras proteins regulate oxidant production and that a rise in intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> represents a critical signal mediating replicative senescence."
https://openalex.org/W1965404141,"Various members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily activate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways through their interaction with TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). We have previously shown that the cytoplasmic domain of receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) interacts with TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 and that its overexpression activates NF-κB and JNK pathways. Through a detailed mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of RANK, we demonstrate that TRAF2 and TRAF5 bind to consensus TRAF binding motifs located in the C terminus at positions 565–568 and 606–611, respectively. In contrast, TRAF6 interacts with a novel motif located between residues 340 and 358 of RANK. Furthermore, transfection experiments with RANK and its deletion mutants in human embryonic 293 cells revealed that the TRAF6-binding region (340–358), but not the TRAF2 or TRAF5-binding region, is necessary and sufficient for RANK-induced NF-κB activation. Moreover, a kinase mutant of NIK (NIK-KM) inhibited RANK-induced NF-κB activation. However, RANK-mediated JNK activation required a distal portion (427–603) of RANK containing the TRAF2-binding domain. Thus, our results indicate that RANK interacts with various TRAFs through distinct motifs and activates NF-κB via a novel TRAF6 interaction motif, which then activates NIK, thus leading to NF-κB activation, whereas RANK most likely activates JNK through a TRAF2-interacting region in RANK.

Consequently, the activation of NF-κB by NIK is mediated through its interaction with the IκBα kinase (IKKα and IKKβ) complex (25Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A.

Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether these TRAFs bind to the same region of RANK or which TRAF or TRAFs are necessary for activation of NF-κB and JNK. Similarly, it is not known whether NIK is involved in RANK-induced NF-κB activation. In addressing the role of various TRAFs and NIK in NF-κB and JNK activation mediated by RANK, we now demonstrate that RANK activates NF-κB by interacting with TRAF6 via a novel TRAF6 interaction motif and TRAF6 potentially activates NIK, leading to NF-κB activation, whereas RANK activates JNK through a TRAF2-interacting region in RANK.RESULTSIn previous studies, we found that the intracellular domain (residues 234–616) of RANK contains three putative TRAF binding motifs of the sequence PXQXT: two located at the C terminus and one localized in the middle of the cytoplasmic domain (16Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We also previously reported that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 interact with RANK (16Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of RANK in 293 cells activates the NF-κB and JNK pathways (1Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 16Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study, we sought to identify more specifically which regions of RANK are responsible for the activation of NF-κB and JNK and, furthermore, to define which TRAF molecules are responsible for these signaling pathways.Different Regions of RANK Are Responsible for Binding TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6As we previously reported (16Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), RANK contains three putative TRAF binding motifs (Fig.1 A) and RANK interacts with TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6. To identify which region of the cytoplasmic domain of RANK is necessary for binding TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, we constructed a series of deletion mutants of the cytoplasmic domain of RANK encompassing the various putative TRAF-binding domains (Fig.1 A). Each of these deletion mutants were fused in-frame with GST and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. We examined the ability of each GST-RANK fusion protein to precipitate epitope-tagged TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 upon their overexpression in 293 cells (Fig. 1 B). We observed strong interaction of TRAF2 and TRAF5 with GST-RANK fusion proteins containing residues 529–616. However, while TRAF2 was still capable of binding to GST-RANK fusion proteins lacking the last 13 amino acids, TRAF5 was not (Fig.1 B, top and middle). These data suggest that TRAF-binding domain III is responsible for TRAF5 interaction and that both TRAF II and TRAF III binding motifs are required for high-affinity binding of TRAF2, but the TRAF III binding motif is not essential for RANK's interaction with TRAF2. Unlike TRAF2 and TRAF5, TRAF6 did not interact with TRAF-binding domains II and III (Fig. 1 B, bottom). This is consistent with a data indicating that TRAF6 does not bind to the PXQXT motif (11Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayshi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S. Watanabe T. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28745-28748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, TRAF6 did bind to RANK between residues 326 and 427 (Fig. 1 B, bottom). Conversely, GST-RANK deletion mutants that did not contain residues 326–427 did not bind TRAF6 (Fig. 1, A and B). Inspection of the amino acid sequence between residues 326 and 427 revealed a putative TRAF6 binding motif (see below). Hence, the cytoplasmic domain of RANK appears to interact with TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 molecules using three distinct motifs.A Minimal Region of RANK (Residues 326–427) Activates NF-κBHow interactions of different TRAFs with RANK affect RANK's ability to activate NF-κB and JNK is not known. To examine this, we constructed FLAG-tagged RANK deletion mutants (identical to those deletion mutants used to construct GST-RANK) in pCMVFLAG1 (Fig.2 A). Their expression was determined by transient transfection in 293 cells and Western blotting with anti-FLAG (Fig. 2 B). As expected, all of the FLAG-tagged RANK deletion mutants were expressed similarly in 293 cells.Figure 2Schematic diagram and expression of FLAG-tagged RANK and its deletion mutants. A, diagrammatic representation of RANK and its deletion mutants. All RANK deletion mutants were fused with a FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus using the signal sequence in the expression vector pCMVFLAG1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RANK-616, -530, -427, and -330 were previously described (16Darnay B.G.

Transient overexpression of RANK616 in 293 cells activated NF-κB-dependent reporter activity (Fig.3 A), which could be inhibited by co-transfection of an IκBα mutant lacking its N-terminal phosphorylation sites (data not shown). Deletion of the C-terminal region up to residue 427 (RANK427) had no effect on NF-κB-dependent reporter activity, but further deletion to residue 330 (RANK330) failed to activate NF-κB (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, when only the C-terminal region was fused to the transmembrane domain of RANK, NF-κB-dependent activity was either very weak (RANK429–616) or failed to respond (RANK529–616) (Fig. 3 A), although each of the deletion mutants RANK429–616 and RANK529–616 interacted strongly with TRAF2 and TRAF5 (Fig. 2). Truncation of the TRAF5-binding region (RANK603 and RANK326–603) did not appear to affect NF-κB-dependent reporter activity. Together, these data indicate that residues 326–427 are responsible for activation of NF-κB. This was further confirmed by transfection of a deletion mutant, containing only residues 326–427 fused to the transmembrane region of RANK, which activated NF-κB-dependent reporter activity similar to that of RANK616 (Fig. 3 A). The observations that some RANK deletion mutants (i.e. R530) activate NF-κB stronger than the full-length suggest that other factors may regulate RANK signaling such as cell surface receptor expression, other receptor-associated factors, and receptor processing. Nevertheless, taken together, these data suggest that the interaction of TRAF2 and TRAF5 with RANK is not required for RANK-induced NF-κB, but that the interaction of TRAF6 with RANK is necessary and sufficient for mediating NF-κB activation by RANK.Figure 3A minimal region of RANK (residues 326–427) activates NF-κB-dependent SEAP reporter activity via NIK.

Co-transfection of NIK-KM with RANK616 or RANK326–427 inhibited NF-κB-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 3 B). Collectively, these data indicate that RANK activates NF-κB via residues 326–427, which interacts with TRAF6. Since TRAF6 has been demonstrated to interact with NIK (7Song H.Y. Regnier C.H.

We therefore examined the ability of each RANK deletion mutant to activate co-transfected HA-JNK1. RANK616 activated JNK strongly, RANK427 and RANK530 activated JNK marginally, while RANK330 failed to activate JNK (Fig.4 A). Similar to our results in the NF-κB-dependent reporter assay, the C-terminal region of RANK (residues 529–616) failed to activate JNK. Moreover, truncation of the TRAF5-binding domain, residues 604–616 (RANKE603), had no effect on JNK activation, which suggests that RANK's interaction with TRAF5 is not required for JNK activation. The inability of these deletion mutants to activate JNK was not due to a lack of expression of transfected HA-JNK (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, unlike NF-κB activation by RANK, truncation of the TRAF2-binding domain (i.e. RANK326–427 and RANK326–530) reduced JNK activation by 3-fold when compared with RANKE616 (Fig.4 A). These data suggest that, unlike the TRAF6-binding domain of RANK, which is required for NF-κB activation, the TRAF2-binding domain is required but not sufficient for activation of JNK.Figure 4The region in RANK that activates JNK overlaps the region in RANK necessary for induction of NF-κB.

The main death pathway activated by Fas receptor involves the adaptor protein FADD (for Fas-associated deathdomain) that connects Fas receptor to the caspase cascade. Anticancer drugs have been shown to enhance both Fas receptor and Fas ligand expression on tumor cells. The contribution of Fas ligand-Fas receptor interactions to the cytotoxic activity of these drugs remains controversial. Here, we show that neither the antagonistic anti-Fas antibody ZB4 nor the Fas-IgG molecule inhibit drug-induced apoptosis in three different cell lines. The expression of Fas ligand on the plasma membrane, which is identified in untreated U937 human leukemic cells but remains undetectable in untreated HT29 and HCT116 human colon cancer cell lines, is not modified by exposure to various cytotoxic agents. These drugs induce the clustering of Fas receptor, as observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and its interaction with FADD, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Overexpression of FADD by stable transfection sensitizes tumor cells to drug-induced cell death and cytotoxicity, whereas down-regulation of FADD by transient transfection of an antisense construct decreases tumor cell sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis. These results were confirmed by transient transfection of constructs encoding either a FADD dominant negative mutant or MC159 or E8 viral proteins that inhibit the FADD/caspase-8 pathway.

It has been proposed that the molecular process leading from specific cellular damage induced by the drugs to apoptosis might involve an interaction between Fas ligand and Fas (19Friesen C. Herr I.

However, this issue remains controversial because antagonistic anti-Fas antibodies that block Fas-L-mediated apoptosis do not always inhibit drug-induced cell death (21Eischen C.M. Kottke T.J.

We show that anticancer drugs can induce Fas receptor clustering and FADD recruitment to Fas receptor in a Fas ligand-independent fashion. By modulating FADD expression, we also demonstrate the role of this adaptor molecule in drug-induced apoptosis.DISCUSSIONThe molecular mechanisms involved during the course of apoptosis upon exposure to anticancer drugs are still poorly understood but are of major importance for the understanding of tumor cell killing. Induction of apoptosis occurs through multiple pathways and depends on the stimulus. We have previously shown that anticancer agents could increase Fas receptor at the tumor cell surface by enhancing Fas gene expression. The increase in Fas receptor was functional, and drug-treated tumor cells were rendered more sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis (18Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Martin F. Dimanche-Boitrel M.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Whether interaction of Fas receptor with its ligand plays a role in anticancer drug-mediated cytotoxicity remains a controversial issue (21Eischen C.M. Kottke T.J. Martins L.M. Basi G.S. Tung J.S. Earnshaw W.C. Leibson P.J. Kaufmann S.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 935-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that the antagonistic anti-Fas antibody ZB4 and the Fas-IgG molecule, used at a concentration that inhibits Fas-mediated and radiation-induced apoptosis (27Belka C. Marini P. Budach W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Lang F. Gulbins E. Bamberg M. Radiat.

Moreover, we failed to detect any modification of Fas-L expression on the plasma membrane of tumor cells exposed to cytotoxic agents (27Belka C. Marini P. Budach W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Lang F.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that anticancer drugs could induce Fas receptor aggregation and FADD association to Fas.Analyses of lymphocytes from FADD −/− mice have recently demonstrated the prominent role of the FADD/procaspase-8 pathway in cell death triggered by either Fas-L or agonistic anti-Fas antibodies (14Zhang J.K. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The influence of FADD on the cell fate depends on the cell system and the stimulus. FADD exhibits a Fas-L-independent proapoptotic activity in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (9Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar), whereas its overexpression promotes the growth of lymphoid T cells (31Newton K. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Smith K.G.C. Strasser A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We show here that FADD plays a role in drug-induced apoptosis. We obtained two HT29 cell clones that stably overexpressed FADD, indicating that a limited 2-fold increase in FADD protein expression was not sufficient to trigger apoptosis in these cells. These FADD overexpressing clones were more sensitive to drug-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity than control cells. A role for FADD in drug-induced cell death was further demonstrated by the decreased toxicity of cytotoxic agents in HT29 cells in which FADD expression was reduced by transient expression of an antisense construct. Similar results were obtained by inhibiting the FADD/procaspase-8 pathway at different levels using transient expression of viral proteins (26Bertin J. Armstrong R.C. Ottilie S. Martin D.A. Wang Y.

Altogether our data indicate that anticancer drugs can induce Fas receptor clustering in a Fas-L-independent fashion and recruit FADD to Fas receptor in the cytotoxic process leading to apoptosis.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) on the surface of certain malignant cells. It has been proposed that the molecular process leading from specific cellular damage induced by the drugs to apoptosis might involve an interaction between Fas ligand and Fas (19Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). However, this issue remains controversial because antagonistic anti-Fas antibodies that block Fas-L-mediated apoptosis do not always inhibit drug-induced cell death (21Eischen C.M. Kottke T.J.

We show that anticancer drugs can induce Fas receptor clustering and FADD recruitment to Fas receptor in a Fas ligand-independent fashion. By modulating FADD expression, we also demonstrate the role of this adaptor molecule in drug-induced apoptosis. DISCUSSIONThe molecular mechanisms involved during the course of apoptosis upon exposure to anticancer drugs are still poorly understood but are of major importance for the understanding of tumor cell killing. Induction of apoptosis occurs through multiple pathways and depends on the stimulus. We have previously shown that anticancer agents could increase Fas receptor at the tumor cell surface by enhancing Fas gene expression. The increase in Fas receptor was functional, and drug-treated tumor cells were rendered more sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis (18Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Martin F. Dimanche-Boitrel M.T. J.

Moreover, we failed to detect any modification of Fas-L expression on the plasma membrane of tumor cells exposed to cytotoxic agents (27Belka C. Marini P. Budach W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Lang F.

We obtained two HT29 cell clones that stably overexpressed FADD, indicating that a limited 2-fold increase in FADD protein expression was not sufficient to trigger apoptosis in these cells. These FADD overexpressing clones were more sensitive to drug-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity than control cells. A role for FADD in drug-induced cell death was further demonstrated by the decreased toxicity of cytotoxic agents in HT29 cells in which FADD expression was reduced by transient expression of an antisense construct.

To determine the molecular mechanism(s) of androgen-independent regulation of the PSA gene, the possibility that the androgen receptor (AR) is activated in the absence of androgen by stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) was investigated. Activation of PKA by forskolin resulted in elevated expression of the PSA gene in androgen-depleted LNCaP cells, an effect that was blocked by the antiandrogen, bicalutamide. Further evidence that induction of PSA gene expression was dependent on AR was obtained from experiments using PC3 cells devoid of AR. Neither PSA, PB, nor ARR3androgen-responsive reporters could be induced by activation of PKA in the absence of transfected AR. In addition, when nuclear AR from forskolin-treated LNCaP cells was incubated with oligonucleotides encoding an androgen response element of the PSA promoter and examined by electromobility shift assay, an increase in AR-androgen response element complex formation was observed. Lastly, cotransfection of an expression vector for a chimeric protein encoding the amino-terminal domain of the human AR linked to Gal4 and a 5xGal4UAS reporter gene construct resulted in activation of the amino-terminal domain of the AR by stimulation of PKA activity. These results demonstrate androgen-independent induction of PSA gene expression in prostate cancer cells by an AR-dependent pathway.

Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors have distinct functional domains that include a carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain, a highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) comprising two zinc finger motifs, and a poorly conserved amino-terminal domain that may contain one or more transcriptional activation domains. Binding of ligand to the receptor results in activation or transformation such that the receptor can effectively bind to its specific DNA element. The mechanism of ligand-induced transformation of the AR is not clear, although it is known that the conformation of the AR becomes more compact upon ligand binding, heat shock proteins are dissociated, and dimerization and phosphorylation occur before DNA binding (2Kuil C.W. Berrevoets C.A. Mulder E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27569-27576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the ligand-activated AR may stimulate or repress androgen-regulated genes. However, it has been suggested that the AR can also be transformed in the absence of androgen by elevation of cAMP levels and by growth factors (3Ikonen R. Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Reinikainen P. Janne O.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 4Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H.

The mechanism of such ligand-independent activation of AR has not been clarified but may involve the bypassing of one of the above-mentioned processes associated with ligand-dependent transformation. Of these, phosphorylation has been implicated in the ligand-independent activation of the progesterone, estrogen, and retinoic acid receptors. On the other hand, although there are three identified phosphorylation sites on the AR, its phosphorylation does not appear to be essential for the induction of androgen-regulated genes (6Zhou Z.X. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 605-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a clinically important androgen-stimulated gene that is used to monitor treatment responses, prognosis, and progression in patients with prostate cancer. The transcriptional regulation of PSA is initially androgen-regulated and undergoes a sharp decline after medical or surgical castration (7Sato N. Gleave M.E. Bruchovsky N. Rennie P.S. Goldenberg S.L. Lange P.H. Sullivan L.D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). When the tumor becomes androgen-independent, PSA mRNA is constitutively up-regulated through an unknown mechanism that presumably involves the promoter and enhancer regions of the PSA gene. These regions have been sequenced as far as −5824 from the start site of transcription (8Lundwall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Schuur E.R. Henderson G.A Kmetec L.A. Miller J.D. Lamparski H.G Henderson D.R. J. Biol.

The fact that PSA production ultimately increases in an androgen-deprived environment suggests that other factors not directly related to androgens but possibly acting via the AR become paramount, leading to androgen-independent induction of PSA gene expression.In the present study, the possibility that androgen-independent induction of PSA gene expression by cross-talk between the AR and PKA signal transduction pathways was investigated in prostate cancer cell lines. The experiments confirmed that PSA gene expression was induced by activation of PKA and demonstrated, for the first time, activation of the amino terminus of the AR by stimulation of PKA activity.DISCUSSIONSteroid hormone receptors are considered ligand-activated transcription factors. However, recent evidence shows that the human estrogen and the chicken, rat, and rabbit progesterone receptors can mediate extracellular signals in the absence of cognate ligand by dopamine, epidermal growth factor, heregulin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, tumor growth factor α, insulin and insulin-like growth factor I, cAMP, okadaic acid, and vanadate (22Aronica S.M.

Other human steroid hormone receptors such as the glucocorticoid, progesterone, and mineralocorticoid receptors, apparently are not activated in the absence of ligand by these compounds (27Picard D. Bunone G. Liu J.W. Donzé O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Weigel N.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).Recently, it has been suggested that the human AR can also be activated in the absence of its cognate ligands by insulin-like growth factor I, keratinocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and compounds that elevate cAMP (4Culig Z.

However, induction of PSA gene expression by androgen-independent activation of the AR in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells has not been previously reported. Therefore, the present studies investigated androgen-independent induction of PSA gene expression via cross-talk between the AR and PKA signal transduction pathways, and these studies revealed the following: 1) PSA gene expression is induced by activation of PKA; 2) PKA induction of androgen-responsive reporter genes is promoter-specific; 3) induction of PSA gene expression by PKA requires a functional AR; and 4) PKA appears to target the amino terminus region of the AR.Forskolin induction of PSA gene expression in LNCaP cells was shown by both Northern blot and the PSA reporter gene construct. The transient induction of PSA mRNA by activation of PKA using forskolin was shown to be dose-dependent, with the optimal concentration at 1 μm. At higher concentrations of forskolin, the levels of PSA mRNA did not plateau, but rather these concentrations resulted in a decrease in the induction of PSA mRNA. Forskolin concentrations of 10 μm or higher did not induce PSA mRNA above control levels. High concentrations of forskolin also decreased induction of PSA mRNA by R1881. This lack of induction of PSA mRNA at high concentrations of forskolin could not be explained by cytotoxic effects. However, these results are consistent with the report of Blok et al. (19Blok L.J. de Ruiter P.E. Brinkmann A.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), showing that a high concentration of forskolin decreases the phosphorylation of AR, thereby attenuating its DNA binding activity.In agreement with the results showing the induction of PSA mRNA by forskolin, PSA reporter activity was also induced by forskolin and overexpression of PKAc in LNCaP cells. The PB-luciferase reporter was also induced by forskolin in LNCaP and PC3 cells that were transfected with wild-type human AR. Curiously, the powerful androgen-responsive ARR3-tk-luciferase reporter construct, which contains three repeats of the probasin ARE1 and ARE2, was poorly induced by forskolin and PKAc relative to R1881. One explanation for this weak induction may be a requirement of different factors for the thymidine kinase minimal promoter, as compared with the PSA and PB natural promoters.Evidence that forskolin activates the AR to induce PSA gene expression is based on the following: 1) the induction of PSA gene expression by forskolin in LNCaP cells was blocked by bicalutamide; 2) the induction of PSA and other ARE reporter gene constructs by forskolin or PKAc in PC3 cells did not occur in the absence of transfected human AR; and 3) an increase in AR-ARE complex formation was observed using nuclear extracts from cells treated with forskolin.Bicalutamide is an antiandrogen that prevents dissociation of the heat shock protein complex from the AR, thereby preventing DNA binding activity and possibly AR nuclear translocation (29Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Brinkmann A.O. Grootegoed J.A. Mulder E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 30Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G.J.M.

Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has been employed in numerous studies to determine the role of the AR in the activation of androgen-responsive reporter gene constructs (4Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5474-5478PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nazareth L.V. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19900-19907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In this study, application of bicalutamide blocked forskolin induction of PSA mRNA and androgen responsive reporter activities. These results show that the induction of PSA gene expression by forskolin is dependent upon a functional AR and imply cross-talk between the AR and PKA signal transduction pathways.Further evidence that the AR is required for forskolin induction of reporter gene constructs containing AREs can be drawn from studies using the PC3 cell line. These cells are devoid of AR and therefore provide a good model for studying the requirement of AR in the induction of these reporters by forskolin. In the absence of transfected AR, forskolin induction of PSA-, PB-, and ARR3-luciferase activities did not occur. However, if the wild-type human AR was expressed in these cells, forskolin was able to induce these reporters. These data are consistent with the conclusion that forskolin activates the AR to induce androgen-responsive genes. In addition, these data demonstrate that the induction of PSA gene expression in LNCaP cells is not unique to the mutated AR endogenously expressed in this cell line (32Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. van Rooij H.C. Trapman J. Brinkman A.O. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 240-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar).If the AR is activated by forskolin, an increase in AR-ARE complex formation should be observed. Application of EMSA confirmed that indeed an increase in AR-ARE complex formation did occur when nuclear extracts from LNCaP cells treated with forskolin were used together with PSA-ARE oligonucleotides. Unexpectedly, there was more AR-ARE complex formation when using nuclear extracts from forskolin-treated cells than from R1881-treated cells. This was not anticipated because the data in Fig.4 B shows a 40-fold increase in nuclear levels of AR protein in R1881-treated cells, as opposed to a 5-fold increase in nuclear AR levels in forskolin-treated cells. Although AR DNA binding activity is dependent on the amount of AR present in the assay, other factors are also crucial for DNA binding activity. Thus, it is conceivable that forskolin-transformed AR may have a greater affinity for the PSA-ARE than the AR activated by R1881. Such enhancement of affinity may result from differential interactions with other proteins or modulation of the receptor that may include a change in its phosphorylation state.Upon establishing that forskolin elevates PSA gene expression by an AR-dependent pathway, the next step was to map what region of the AR was targeted. To do this, chimeric fragments of the AR receptor fused to the DBD of the Gal4 protein, together with the Gal4 reporter system, were employed (Fig. 8). These data provide the first demonstration of activation of the amino-terminal domain of the AR by stimulation of the PKA signal transduction pathway. In vivo, the transcriptional activation of the AR requires the AF-1 in the amino-terminal domain (28Weigel N.L. Biochem.

Although distinct transactivation regions may be active for specific responsive promoters, ligand-dependentversus ligand-independent activation of the AR also may target different transactivation regions. This would result in recruitment of different co-activators or altered interactions with the basal transcription machinery. Studies examining ligand-independent activation of the estrogen receptor by growth factors and PKA have determined that epidermal growth factor (38El-Tanani M.K.K. Green C.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 928-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and insulin growth factor (39Ignar-Trowbridge D.M. Pimentel M. Parker M.G. McLachlan J.A. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) act primarily by means of the transactivation domain AF-1 (in the amino terminus), whereas PKA acts through the transactivation domain AF-2 (in the carboxyl terminus) (38El-Tanani M.K.K. Green C.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 928-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Hence, the estrogen receptor can be activated through three signaling molecules, estradiol, cAMP, and growth factors, each acting through a different discrete domain. Although this study shows forskolin activation of the amino terminus of the AR in LNCaP cells, further experiments are in progress to map the precise site.Whether forskolin/PKA directly alters the phosphorylation state of the amino-terminal domain of the AR is not known. There is reason to believe that a change in the phosphorylation state may be involved because this domain contains numerous potential serine phosphorylation sites for not only PKA but also for mitogen-activated protein kinase, DNA-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, casein kinase II, and serine-proline-directed kinase (40Blok L.J. de Ruiter P.E. Brinkmann A.O. Endocr. Res. 1996; 22: 197-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism could potentially affect the ability of the receptor to dissociate from the heat shock proteins, shuttle to and from the nucleus, bind DNA, interact with other transcription factors, or activate particular responsive genes. However, early work examining AR phosphorylation strongly indicates that PKA does not directly alter the total phosphorylation state of the AR (41Goueli S.A. Holtzman J.L. Ahmed K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, although there are different phosphorylated isoforms of the AR (21Kemppainen J.A. Lane M.V. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 968-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42van Laar J.H. Berrevoets C.A. Trapman J. Zegers N.D. Brinkmann A.O. J. Biol.

Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 45Kuiper G.G. Brinkmann A.O. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), AR transactivation does not appear to be affected by phosphorylation. Therefore, a more likely scenario may involve the changes in the phosphorylation state of a co-regulator or another protein factor that binds to the amino-terminal domain of the AR, thereby increasing AR transactivation activity. Such a hypothesis may also help to explain the promoter specificity of AR that is activated by forskolin seen in Fig. 2.In summary, the data presented here provides evidence that the amino terminus of the AR can be activated by PKA or elevation of cAMP by forskolin in LNCaP cells to initiate transcription of some genes containing AREs, such as PSA. Identification of such a mechanism may be of critical importance in the understanding of the molecular changes that are involved in the progression of prostate cancer to androgen independence. Through mapping of the site on the AR that is targeted by PKA, new approaches to averting androgen-independent prostate cancer might be developed. The androgen receptor (AR)1 belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors that mediates the actions of lipophilic ligands, including steroids, retinoids, vitamin D3, and thyroid hormones (1Zilliacus J. Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors have distinct functional domains that include a carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain, a highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) comprising two zinc finger motifs, and a poorly conserved amino-terminal domain that may contain one or more transcriptional activation domains. Binding of ligand to the receptor results in activation or transformation such that the receptor can effectively bind to its specific DNA element. The mechanism of ligand-induced transformation of the AR is not clear, although it is known that the conformation of the AR becomes more compact upon ligand binding, heat shock proteins are dissociated, and dimerization and phosphorylation occur before DNA binding (2Kuil C.W. Berrevoets C.A. Mulder E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27569-27576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the ligand-activated AR may stimulate or repress androgen-regulated genes. However, it has been suggested that the AR can also be transformed in the absence of androgen by elevation of cAMP levels and by growth factors (3Ikonen R. Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Reinikainen P. Janne O.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 4Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H.

The mechanism of such ligand-independent activation of AR has not been clarified but may involve the bypassing of one of the above-mentioned processes associated with ligand-dependent transformation. Of these, phosphorylation has been implicated in the ligand-independent activation of the progesterone, estrogen, and retinoic acid receptors. On the other hand, although there are three identified phosphorylation sites on the AR, its phosphorylation does not appear to be essential for the induction of androgen-regulated genes (6Zhou Z.X. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 605-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a clinically important androgen-stimulated gene that is used to monitor treatment responses, prognosis, and progression in patients with prostate cancer. The transcriptional regulation of PSA is initially androgen-regulated and undergoes a sharp decline after medical or surgical castration (7Sato N. Gleave M.E. Bruchovsky N. Rennie P.S. Goldenberg S.L. Lange P.H. Sullivan L.D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). When the tumor becomes androgen-independent, PSA mRNA is constitutively up-regulated through an unknown mechanism that presumably involves the promoter and enhancer regions of the PSA gene. These regions have been sequenced as far as −5824 from the start site of transcription (8Lundwall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The fact that PSA production ultimately increases in an androgen-deprived environment suggests that other factors not directly related to androgens but possibly acting via the AR become paramount, leading to androgen-independent induction of PSA gene expression. In the present study, the possibility that androgen-independent induction of PSA gene expression by cross-talk between the AR and PKA signal transduction pathways was investigated in prostate cancer cell lines. The experiments confirmed that PSA gene expression was induced by activation of PKA and demonstrated, for the first time, activation of the amino terminus of the AR by stimulation of PKA activity.

The combination of β and γ cleavages generates Aβ. α-Secretase cleaves APP within the Aβ domain, releasing αAPPs, the large extracellular domain. While αAPPs is generated primarily at or en route to the plasma membrane (17Sambamurti K. Refolo L.M. Shioi J. Pappolla M.A. Robakis N.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 674: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Aβ is formed in both the secretory and endocytic pathways (8Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the majority of secreted Aβ is made in the endocytic pathway (8Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that the cytoplasmic tail of APP is important for the regulation of APP metabolism and localization. The carboxyl terminus of APP contains the sequence YENPTY. NPXY is a consensus sequence for endocytosis of low density lipoprotein receptors (18Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of portions of APP that contain the YENPTY sequence results in increased secretion of APPs and decreased secretion of Aβ (8Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19da Cruz e Silva O. Iverfeldt K. Oltersdorf T. Sinha S. Lieberburg I. Ramabhadran T.V. Suzuki T. Sisodia S.S. Gandy S.

Mutation of the second tyrosine in the YENPTY sequence to alanine also increases APPs secretion but has no effect on Aβ secretion (23Jacobsen J.S. Spruyt M.A. Brown A.M. Sahasrabudhe S.R. Blume A.J.

These observations suggest that secretion of Aβ and APPsmay be regulated independently by signals in the cytoplasmic tail of APP. FE65 is a brain-enriched protein of unknown function (24Duilio A. Zambrano N. Mogavero A.R. Ammendola R. Cimino F. Russo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of APP. FE65 contains two types of protein-protein interaction domains: a WW domain in the amino terminus and tandem phosphotyrosine interaction domains (PIDs) in the carboxyl terminus. WW domains recognize poly-proline sequences (25Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), whereas PIDs typically recognize phosphorylated NPXY sequences (26Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). FE65 was first shown to interact with APP in the yeast two-hybrid system (27Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30853-30856Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 28Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Jondro P.D. Tanzi R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Subsequently, several studies have shown that FE65 binds directly to the YENPTY sequence in the cytoplasmic domain of APP through its carboxyl-terminal-most PID (28Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Jondro P.D.

Although it was previously thought that PIDs bind to tyrosine–phosphorylated sequences, the FE65-APP interaction is phosphorylation-independent (29Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar,31Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Faraonio R. Sabo S. Cheetham J. Sudol M. Russo T. J.

Because NPXY sequences are known to be involved in molecular targeting and FE65 binds to the YENPTY sequence in APP, we hypothesized that FE65 is an important regulator of Aβ secretion. In this study, we have investigated the effects of FE65 on the metabolism and trafficking of APP. Rat FE65 was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a mammalian expression vector, by polymerase chain reaction. The 5′ polymerase chain reaction primer encoded an amino-terminal FLAG epitope tag. Polyclonal antibodies to FE65 were raised by immunizing rabbits with the WW domain of FE65 (25Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) fused to glutathioneS-transferase. The antibodies were tested for their specificity in immunoblots and immunoprecipitations by competition with antigen. Two polyclonal antibodies demonstrating high affinity and specificity (170 and 173) were combined and affinity purified on a CNBr-activated Sepharose-WW domain column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fig. 1, a and bshow the specificity of the antibodies for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, respectively. In both cases, the antibodies recognized a band around 100 kDa that was greatly increased in intensity upon transfection with FE65 cDNA. 5A3/1G7 (8Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a mixture of monoclonal APP antibodies used for the immunofluorescence studies, were a generous gift of E. H. Koo. 369, a polyclonal antibody, was used to immunoprecipitate holoAPP (32Buxbaum J.D. Gandy S.E. Cicchetti P. Ehrlich M.E. Czernik A.J. Fracasso R.P. Ramabhadran T.V. Unterbeck A.J. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6003-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Monoclonal Aβ antibodies 6E10 and 4G8 were used for immunoprecipitation and ELISA (33Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9195-9198Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of FE65 on APP, a cell line was needed that expressed low levels of endogenous FE65, therefore permitting manipulation of FE65 protein levels by exogenous expression. For this purpose, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), which overexpress the 695-amino acid isoform of APP (MDCK-695) were stably transfected with FE65 cDNA. MDCK-695 cells were a generous gift of C. Haass (34Haass C. Koo E.H. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1564-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were stably transfected with FE65 in 10-cm diameter plates using the calcium phosphate transfection system (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY), essentially following the manufacturer instructions. Each plate was transfected with 15 μg of FE65 in pcDNA3 and 5 μg of pPUR (CLONTECH), a selection vector containing a puromycin resistance gene. After selection with 2. 5 μg/ml puromycin (CLONTECH), individual clones were isolated using cloning rings. Clonal cell lines with high expression of FE65 (MDCK-695/FE65) were identified by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 a) and immunoprecipitation (Fig.1 b) with FE65 antibodies. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 μg/ml puromycin. Fig. 1 cshows APP expression in representative MDCK-695 and MDCK-695/FE65 cell lines. Levels of APP expression did not vary with FE65 expression. Control cell lines, obtained by transfection of MDCK-695 cells with vector, were simultaneously prepared by puromycin selection. No significant differences were seen in these control cells compared with MDCK-695 cells (data not shown). In parallel, cell lines were prepared that stably overexpressed FE65 but not APP (MDCK-FE65). MDCK and MDCK-FE65 cells were transiently transfected with APP-751 cDNA. The transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described in the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, a 10-cm diameter plate of cells was transfected with 10 μg of APP in pcDNA3 for 8–12 h. Cells were assayed approximately 48 h post-transfection. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed essentially as described (33Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9195-9198Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 5.0 × 104 cells/cm2 and then grown for approximately 16 h. After washing, they were incubated with [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) in methionine-free DMEM for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by a 2-h chase at 37 °C in complete DMEM. αAPPs was immunoprecipitated from the chase medium with 6E10, and Aβ with 6E10 plus 4G8, followed in both cases by agarose-linked goat anti-mouse IgG (American Qualex, La Mirada, CA). Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified by PhosphorImager. Total labeled cellular holoAPP was determined by lysing cells with 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS immediately after labeling, followed by immunoprecipitation with 369 and Sepharose-linked protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (32Buxbaum J.D. Gandy S.E. Cicchetti P. Ehrlich M.E. Czernik A.J. Fracasso R.P. Ramabhadran T.V. Unterbeck A.J. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6003-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Values obtained for αAPPs and Aβ were normalized to this total labeled APP in each experiment. For the sandwich ELISA, cell medium was changed to fresh serum-free DMEM. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, conditioned medium was collected and subjected to a sandwich ELISA (35Desdouits F. Buxbaum J.D. Desdouits-Magnen J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24670-24674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) for Aβ using 6E10 as the capture antibody. For detection, samples were incubated with biotinylated 4G8 followed by alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-biotin. Aβ was quantified with a Dynatech plate reader. The values obtained were normalized to total cellular holoAPP determined by immunoblotting with 369 and125I-protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by PhosphorImager quantification. Cells were plated at 3.5 × 104 cells/cm2 on glass coverslips. Except where indicated, the cells were briefly pre-permeabilized with 0.02% saponin in 80 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 7.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 30% glycerol and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 0.12 m sucrose for 10 min at 4 °C. The coverslips were then incubated in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min at room temperature, rinsed in PBS, and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Primary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, and secondary antibodies were added for 1 h at room temperature in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin. The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse IgG and goat-anti-rabbit IgG for APP and FE65, respectively, conjugated to rhodamine red-X and Oregon green-488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Coverslips were mounted with DABCO in polyvinyl alcohol. For surface immunofluorescence, cells were blocked and incubated with primary antibody before fixation. In all cases, immunofluorescence was eliminated by omission of primary antibody or by competition with antigen (data not shown). Immunofluorescence was examined by deconvolution light microscopy (Deltavision) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM510). Iodixanol gradients were formed by layering successively less concentrated solutions of Optiprep (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a centrifuge tube and then placing the tube on its side for 3–4 h essentially as described in the manufacturer instructions. Optiprep was chosen because it is an iso-osmotic medium; it resolves ER, Golgi, and lysosomes extremely well; and continuous gradients can be made very easily and reproducibly without high speed centrifugation. MDCK-695/FE65 cells were gently scraped from 15-cm diameter plates and collected by centrifugation. They were then homogenized in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose with a metal Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei, unbroken cells, large pieces of plasma membrane, and heavy mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g. The supernatant (PNS) was then centrifuged at 17,000 × gfor 15 min. The 17,000 × g pellet was loaded on a preformed 10–30% continuous iodixanol gradient and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a swinging bucket rotor. The 17,000 × g supernatant was loaded on a preformed 0–40% continuous iodixanol gradient and centrifuged at 85,000 × g for 45 min. The gradients were unloaded by aspiration of 1-ml fractions from the top of the gradient. After centrifugation of the fractions at 100,000 × g to collect the membranes and remove the iodixanol, the 100,000 × g pellets were resuspended, boiled in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. MDCK cells were plated at 3.0 × 106 cells per 10-cm diameter dish. After washing twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Sigma), cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in HBSS at 4 °C for 30 min. Unreacted biotin was eliminated by two washes with DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and two washes with HBSS. The cells were then lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40, and equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the APP antibody, 369. The immunoprecipitated material was then immunoblotted with anti-biotin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and 125I-protein A. Cell surface APP was quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). When measured by sandwich ELISA, Aβ secretion increased 4.2 ± 0.5-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 12, p < 0.0001) in MDCK-695/FE65 cells when compared with MDCK-695 cells (Fig. 2 a). Qualitatively similar results were observed by pulse-chase labeling followed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 b). In all cases, values were normalized to holoAPP; therefore, the observed differences were not because of variation in total APP levels. Immunoprecipitation of αAPPs from conditioned medium of [35S]methionine pulse-labeled MDCK-695 and MDCK-695/FE65 cells demonstrated that overexpression of FE65 increased secretion of αAPPs. During a 2-h chase, MDCK-695/FE65 cells secreted 1.7 ± 0.1-fold (n = 11, p < 0.0005) more αAPPs than did MDCK-695 cells (Fig. 3 a). Stable overexpression of FE65 enhanced release of αAPPs from an independent MDCK cell line (MDCK-FE65) transiently transfected with the 751-amino acid isoform of APP by 2.2 ± 0.1-fold (n = 6, p < 0.0001), as compared with MDCK cells similarly transfected with APP-751 (Fig. 3 b). Therefore, FE65 regulates APP metabolism independent of APP isoform. Large increases in αAPPs secretion are often accompanied by decreases in Aβ secretion, probably because of substrate depletion (33Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9195-9198Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 36Gabuzda D. Busciglio J. Yankner B.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2326-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 37Hung A.Y.

Cypess A.M. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4489-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast, lesser increases in αAPPs can be accompanied by an increase in Aβ (38Buxbaum J.D. Ruefli A.A. Parker C.A. Cypess A.M. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4489-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the present study, FE65 increased both αAPPs and Aβ secretion. To determine whether substrate depletion occurred upon overexpression of FE65, we determined the approximate percentage of APP molecules secreted as either αAPPs or Aβ. Over the time course of these studies, approximately 20% of APP labeled during the chase was converted to αAPPs and less than 10% to Aβ, consistent with the idea that holoAPP substrate was not rate-limiting. FE65 and APP co-immunoprecipitate from homogenates of MDCK-695/FE65 cells (data not shown; and see Ref. 39Thinakaran G. Regard J.B. Bouton C.M.L. Harris C.L. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 4: 438-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and other cell types (28Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Jondro P.D. Tanzi R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6399-6405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To determine where FE65 and APP interact in intact cells, MDCK-695/FE65 cells were double labeled with a mixture of polyclonal FE65 antibodies, 170 and 173, and a mixture of APP monoclonal antibodies, 5A3 and 1G7 (8Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then examined by confocal microscopy. The two proteins co-localized in perinuclear organelles (Fig. 4) that may be ER/Golgi compartments and/or endosomes. The strong co-localization of APP and FE65 supports the hypothesis that APP and FE65 interactin vivo. If the binding of FE65 to APP has a true physiological role in the brain, then FE65 and APP should co-localize in neural-derived cells that express both proteins at endogenous levels. H4 human neuroglioma cells were examined with the same antibodies that were used for the MDCK cells. FE65 and APP fluorescence again overlapped in juxta-nuclear organelles and at some edges of H4 cells (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the effects of FE65 on APP processing are mediated by the interaction of APP and FE65 in either the ER/Golgi or in the recycling pathway. They also suggest that the interaction may be an important regulator of APP processing in neurons, which express high endogenous levels of both proteins. To further confirm that the interaction of FE65 and APP is likely to occur in MDCK cells in vivo and to characterize the compartments in which they interact, MDCK-695/FE65 PNS was separated into a 17,000 × g pellet and supernatant followed by separation on iodixanol gradients. The 17,000 × gpellet contains Golgi, lysosomes, light mitochondria, peroxisomes, and ER, whereas the 17,000 × g supernatant contains small vesicles, endosomes, and soluble proteins. FE65 and APP co-localized in the least dense organelles of the 17,000 × g pellet (Fig. 6 a and b). There was a strong, sharp peak of both APP and FE65 in fraction 1, with a smaller, broader peak in fractions 3–6. Fraction 1 contains relatively pure Golgi (40Graham J. Ford T. Rickwood D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 41Mannaerts G.P. van Veldhoven P. van Broekhoven A. Vandebroek G. Debeer L.J. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and was highly enriched in rab6, a Golgi marker (data not shown). Fractions 3–6 are highly enriched in ER (40Graham J. Ford T. Rickwood D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,41Mannaerts G.P. van Veldhoven P. van Broekhoven A. Vandebroek G. Debeer L.J. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Most of the APP seen in these fractions appeared to be immature as would be expected for ER-associated APP (Fig. 6 a). APP and FE65 also co-localized in the least dense fractions from the 17,000 × g supernatant (Fig. 6, c andd). Although these gradients have not been characterized well in the literature, fraction 1 was highly enriched in both rab11 and EEA1 (data not shown). Rab11 localizes to secretory vesicles, endosomes, and TGN (42Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar), whereas EEA1 is an early endosomal marker (43Mu F.-T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.-P. Tock E.-P. Toh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Therefore, fraction 1 contained endosomes. It may have also contained other membranes, such as small vesicles derived from the TGN, although it was not rab6 immunoreactive. Together our data suggest that there is a strong co-localization of APP and FE65 in the ER/Golgi and possibly in endosomes. To visualize APP at the cell surface, MDCK-695 and MDCK-695/FE65 cells were labeled with the APP antibodies for immunofluorescence without prior permeabilization. FE65 overexpression caused an increase in high intensity surface APP labeling (Fig. 7). To ensure that the plasma membranes were intact, the cells were also labeled with the FE65 antibodies 170/173. No fluorescence was observed (data not shown), indicating that the APP labeling was indeed extracellular. FE65 overexpression did not alter the APP immunostaining patterns in permeabilized MDCK-695 and MDCK-695/FE65 cells (data not shown). Thus the FE65-dependent changes in the amount of APP localized to the plasma membrane were specific to that pool of APP. To quantify the effects of FE65 on surface APP, MDCK-695 and MDCK-695/FE65 cells were surface biotinylated. After biotinylation, total APP was immunoprecipitated. The fraction of this APP that was biotinylated at the cell surface was identified by immunoblotting with anti-biotin antibodies. FE65 overexpression caused a 2.4 ± 0.37-fold (n = 9) increase in APP at the cell surface (Fig. 8). These data suggest that an FE65-dependent translocation of APP to the plasma membrane was responsible for the observed changes in the proteolytic processing of APP. We have shown here that FE65 and APP are present in the same subcellular compartments and that FE65 expression increases the amount of APP at the plasma membrane. This translocation of APP to the cell surface is associated with a dramatic increase in Aβ secretion concomitant with a smaller increase in secretion of αAPPs. Our data suggest that the observed increase in APP metabolism may be because of an increased flux of APP through the secretory pathway. Such an increase in trafficking would result in a larger fraction of APP reaching the plasma membrane. Increased flux of APP through the secretory pathway to the cell surface is predicted to result in increased α-secretase cleavage of APP and, therefore, secretion of αAPPs. In addition, routing of more APP to the cell surface increases the amount of APP available for endocytosis. Because much of the Aβ secreted by cultured cells is generated in the endocytic pathway (8Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the observed increase in APP at the plasma membrane is a plausible source of the increased Aβ secretion. Many studies have shown that deletion of the YENPTY sequence of APP results in increased APPs secretion and decreased Aβ secretion (8Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19da Cruz e Silva O. Iverfeldt K. Oltersdorf T. Sinha S. Lieberburg I. Ramabhadran T.V. Suzuki T. Sisodia S.S. Gandy S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas we have shown that overexpression of FE65, which binds to this sequence, can increase secretion of both APPs and Aβ. The difference in the effects of deletion of the YENPTY sequence versus FE65 overexpression is easily explained because the deletion is expected to inhibit efficient endocytosis of APP. If the cell surface APP is endocytosed at a decreased rate, less Aβ will be produced. If FE65 does not interfere with endocytosis, its overexpression would not be expected to affect Aβ secretion in the same way as the deletion. It is interesting to note that mutation of the second tyrosine in the YENPTY sequence, which does not affect FE65 binding, also does not affect Aβ secretion (23Jacobsen J.S. Spruyt M.A. Brown A.M. Sahasrabudhe S.R. Blume A.J. Vitek M.P. Muenkel H.A. Sonnenberg-Reines J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8376-8382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FE65 may produce its effects on secretion of proteolytic fragments of APP by targeting of some other molecule to APP through its other protein-protein interaction domains. In addition to the PID that binds to APP, FE65 contains a WW domain and another, more amino-terminal, PID (27Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30853-30856Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). One of several proteins that binds to the WW domain has recently been identified as mena (44Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H.

Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether mena or other FE65 binding partners affect APP processing as well. The results of the present study suggest that agents that inhibit the interaction of FE65 with APP might decrease Aβ secretion in the brain. Such a reduction in Aβ secretion might then result in decreased accumulation of amyloid plaques. Thus, discovery of an agent that inhibits the interaction of FE65 with APP could provide a novel approach to slowing or preventing the progression of Alzheimer's disease. We thank M. Sudol and T. Russo for stimulating discussion. We also thank E. H. Koo and C. Haass for antibodies and cells, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2055094070,"Adipocyte differentiation is regulated by at least two major transcription factors, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Expression of PPARγ in fibroblasts converts them to fat-laden cells with an adipocyte-like morphology. Here, we investigate the ability of PPARγ to confer insulin-sensitive glucose transport to a variety of murine fibroblast cell lines. When cultured in the presence of a PPARγ ligand, Swiss-3T3 and BALB/c-3T3 cells ectopically expressing PPARγ accumulate lipid droplets, express C/EBPα, aP2, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase, and glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4), and exhibit highly insulin-responsive 2-deoxyglucose uptake. In contrast, PPARγ-expressing NIH-3T3 cells, despite similar lipid accumulation, adipocyte morphology, and aP2 expression, do not express C/EBPα or GLUT4 and fail to acquire insulin sensitivity. In cells ectopically expressing PPARγ, the development of insulin-responsive glucose uptake correlates with C/EBPα expression. Furthermore, ectopic expression of C/EBPα in NIH-3T3 cells converts them to the adipocyte phenotype and restores insulin-sensitive glucose uptake. We propose that the pathway(s) leading to fat accumulation and morphological changes are distinct from that leading to insulin-dependent glucose transport. Our results suggest that although PPARγ is sufficient to trigger the adipogenic program, C/EBPα is required for establishment of insulin-sensitive glucose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1979913231,"We have characterized in vivo andin vitro the recently identified DsbG fromEscherichia coli. In addition to sharing sequence homology with the thiol disulfide exchange protein DsbC, DsbG likewise was shown to form a stable periplasmic dimer, and it displays an equilibrium constant with glutathione comparable with DsbA and DsbC. DsbG was found to be expressed at approximately 25% the level of DsbC. In contrast to earlier results (Andersen, C. L., Matthey-Dupraz, A., Missiakas, D., and Raina, S. (1997) Mol. Microbiol. 26, 121–132), we showed that dsbG is not essential for growth and thatdsbG null mutants display no defect in folding of multiple disulfide-containing heterologous proteins. Overexpression of DsbG, however, was able to restore the ability ofdsbC mutants to express heterologous multidisulfide proteins, namely bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, a protein with three disulfides, and to a lesser extent, mouse urokinase (12 disulfides). As in DsbC, the putative active site thiols in DsbG are completely reduced in vivo in adsbD-dependent fashion, as would be expected if DsbG is acting as a disulfide isomerase or reductase. However, the latter is not likely because DsbG could not catalyze insulin reductionin vitro.

Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The oxidation of cysteine residues to form disulfide bonds can occur spontaneously in the presence of molecular oxygen. However, air oxidation is a slow, mechanistically complex reaction whose time scale is much longer than what is required for the folding of proteins under biosynthetic conditions, i.e. in the cell. As a result, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have evolved elaborate enzymatic mechanisms for the catalysis of disulfide bond formation and for maintaining the proper thiol-disulfide redox balance in various cellular compartments. In Gram-negative bacteria, disulfide bond formation normally occurs following export into the periplasmic space, which is topologically equivalent to the endoplasmic reticulum, albeit substantially more oxidizing (3Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28487-28493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wulfing C. Pluckthun A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies have unequivocally defined four proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, and DsbD) that are involved in the formation of disulfide bonds in secreted proteins (5Raina S. Missiakas D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 179-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). All the known Dsb proteins contain a Cys-X-X-Cys sequence that is characteristic of the thioredoxin superfamily (5Raina S. Missiakas D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 179-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). DsbA is a soluble periplasmic enzyme that serves as a potent catalyst of protein and peptide cysteine oxidation (6Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R.

It also exhibits some disulfide isomerization activity that may be important under some conditionsin vivo (9Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4231-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Joly J.C. Leung W.S. Swartz J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2773-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Once it has transferred its disulfide bond to a substrate, DsbA is rapidly reoxidized by the membrane protein DsbB, which in turn transfers its electrons either to molecular oxygen or to the quinone system (12Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 13Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J. J. Biol.

The oxidation of protein cysteines by DsbA is very rapid but often results in the formation of incorrect disulfide bonds. The rearrangement of nonnative disulfides is catalyzed primarily by the dimeric periplasmic enzyme DsbC (8Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 14Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For DsbC to be able to catalyze disulfide bond isomerization, its active site Cys-X-X-Cys sequence must be present in the dithiol form. Although the redox potentials of DsbA and DsbC are comparable, −89 mV (7Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and −96 mV (calculated from Ref. 8Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), respectively, under steady state conditions in the periplasm DsbA is oxidized, whereas DsbC is almost exclusively reduced (10Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Kishigami S. Akiyama Y. Ito K.

Reduction of DsbC is mediated by cytoplasmic membrane protein DsbD and also depends on the cytoplasmic proteins thioredoxin (TrxA) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) (10Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition to dsbA, dsbB, dsbC, anddsbD, Missiakas and Raina (18Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) have isolated additional genes that affect sensitivity to dithiothreitol (DTT).1 One of these genes was named dsbE and has been proposed to play a role in oxidative protein folding. However, dsbE is identical toccmG, which has been shown to be an inner membrane protein involved in cytochrome biosynthesis in Escherichia coli and other bacteria (19Fabianek R.A. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Kunzler P. Hennecke H. Thony-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4467-4473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Fabianek R.A. Hennecke H. Thony-Meyer L.

It is not yet known whether DsbE affects the oxidation state of proteins other than cytochrome c. Recently, Raina and co-workers (1Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) isolated a gene that functioned as a multicopy suppressor of DTT sensitivity in adsbB − background. The same gene (dsbG) was also isolated in a search for mutants conferring increased sensitivity to DTT and an increase in ςE-dependent periplasmic heat shock response. Interestingly, Andersen et al. (1Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) reported thatdsbG is required for growth unless the cells are provided with exogenous oxidants. This is surprising, since none of the otherdsb genes, including dsbA, which encodes the main catalyst of protein oxidation in the periplasm, is essential. In addition, Andersen et al. (1Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) reported that dsbGcan catalyze insulin reduction in vitro and is partially responsible for the oxidation of alkaline phosphatase in the periplasm. We independently cloned and expressed DsbG and characterized itsin vivo and in vitro function in detail. Contrary to the previous report, we show that dsbG is not an essential gene in E. coli; it is maintained by DsbD exclusively in reduced form, and it does not appear to affect protein oxidation in the periplasm. On the other hand, multicopy expression ofdsbG suppressed the effect of adsbC − mutation on the folding of heterologous multidisulfide substrates. DsbG was found to have a very unstable disulfide much like DsbA and DsbC, but unlike these two proteins it appears to have narrow substrate specificity. Our results indicate that DsbG functions predominantly either as a reductant or as a catalyst for disulfide isomerization. The strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table I. The 5-kbpEco52I/SalI fragment containing the E. coli dsbG gene from Kohara clone 166 (22Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar) was isolated and cloned intoEco52I/SalI-digested pBR322, generating plasmid pPBdsbG. The dsbG coding region was amplified from pPBdsbG by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers 5′-AGGAATTCAGGAGGTCTCTCATGTTAAAAAAGATACTTTTAC-3′ and 5′-CCATCCATGAGGATCCTTTTATTTATTCCCCATAAT-3′. The PCR product was digested with BsaI and BamHI and ligated intoNcoI/BamHI-digested pTrc99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or pET-11d (Novagen, Madison, WI), generating plasmids pTrcdsbG2 and pETdsbG2, respectively. Likewise, dsbG without its stop codon was amplified from pPBdsbG with the same forward primer and reverse primer 5′-CTAGAGGATCCTCGAGTTTATTCCCCATAATGATATT-3′, digested with BsaI and XhoI, and ligated into pET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) that had been cut with NcoI and XhoI. The resulting plasmid, designated pETdsbG2his, contains the coding sequence for DsbG fused to a 6× histidine tag at its C terminus and under the control of the T7 promoter. Plasmid constructions were verified by automated DNA sequencing.Table IStrains and plasmids used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeSource or referenceBL21(DE3)F− ompT dcm (DE3)Laboratory collectionMC4100F−araD139 Δ (argF-lac) U169Laboratory collectionSF110KS272 degP41 Δ(ompT-entF)43Baneyx F.

The purity of DsbG in the nickel-Sepharose™ eluant, was approximately 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. This material was used to raise polyclonal antisera in mice using standard protocols (23$$Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antisera against DsbA and DsbC were a gift of John Joly (Genentech, S. San Francisco, CA). Purified DsbA was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Purified DsbC was a kind gift of John Joly. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma except as noted. To purify DsbG expressed without a hexahistidine affinity tag, E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring the plasmid pETdsbG2 were grown in LB medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to midlog phase (A 600 ∼ 0.5). Cells were then transferred to a 25 °C water bath and induced with 0.5 mm IPTG for 8 h to maximize the concentration of soluble, mature protein in the periplasm. Immediately after induction, the cells were collected by centrifugation, and periplasmic fractions were obtained by the cold osmotic shock procedure as modified by Thorstenson et al.(24Thorstenson Y.R. Zhang Y. Olson P.S. Mascarenhas D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5333-5339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The periplasmic fraction was dialyzed against 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl and applied to a DEAE anion exchange column (Bio-Rad), equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was developed with a linear gradient of NaCl from 50 to 300 mm. Analysis of the collected fractions by SDS-PAGE showed that DsbG eluted between 100 and 150 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were then pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA buffer and applied to a SephadexTM-75 sizing column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. Densitometric analysis of a scanned SDS-PAGE gel revealed that following gel filtration the protein was at least 95% pure. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed on a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager Biospectrometry Workstation with a mass resolution of greater than 95 and error of less than 0.07%. Plasmid pPBdsbG was digested with AflII andSse8387I; the large fragment was isolated, and its ends blunted with T4 polymerase. This fragment was then ligated with either the 1.4-kbp BsaAI fragment of pACYC184 containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene to generate pPBΔdsbG::Cm or the 1.3-kbp kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC-4K to generate pPBΔdsbG::Kan. Plasmid pPBΔdsbG::Cm was linearized and transformed into the recD −strain D301 (25Russell C.B. Thaler D.S. Dahlquist F.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2609-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CmR, AmpS colonies were selected. Additionally, plasmid pPBΔdsbG::Kan was digested with MluI and SphI, and the fragment containing the KanR cassette with the dsbG chromosomal flanking regions was recovered and cloned into pBAD39, a vector containing a conditional IPTG-requiring replicon, an ampicillin resistance gene, and a wild type rpsL gene (TableI). MC4100 cells transformed with the resulting plasmid, pBADΔdsbG::Kan, were grown first in liquid medium without IPTG and then plated on LB agar containing kanamycin, and streptomycin for counterselection. Colonies that were KanR, StrepR, and AmpSwere selected, and correct constructs were confirmed both by immunoblotting to verify the absence of a DsbG band and by PCR using primers flanking the deletion region. TheΔdsbG::Cm and ΔdsbG::Kan mutations were transduced into different strains using P1vir following standard protocols (26Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992: 268-274Google Scholar). Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) expression was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (27Ostermeier M. De Sutter K. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10616-10622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Urokinase activity was detected by indirect chromogenic assay as follows. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to A 600 = 0.7, and protein synthesis was induced by adding IPTG to 1 mm. The cells were harvested 3 h later and lysed by French®pressure cell. Following centrifugation to remove insolubles, the total soluble protein was quantified by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and then diluted to 0.3 μg/μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% Tween 80. In a microtiter plate, 50 μl of whole cell lysate soluble fraction was mixed with 50 μl of human plasminogen (Calbiochem), 0.1 μg/μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% Tween 80, 6 mm6-aminohexanoic acid. The plasminogen substrate, 50 μl of 4 mm Spectrozyme® PL (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT), was added immediately, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured and, after subtracting the background activity of a strain not expressing urokinase, compared with a standard curve prepared using human urokinase (Calbiochem). The in vivo redox state of DsbG was assayed by derivatization of free thiols by 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) under denaturing conditions essentially as described for DsbC (10Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The oxidized standard was purified DsbG without AMS added. The reduced standard was generated by reducing purified DsbG in 40 mm DTT for 20 min at room temperature followed by removal of reducing agent using a gel filtration spin column (Bio-Rad) and AMS derivatization. The redox equilibrium of DsbG with glutathione was assayed as described for DsbA (7Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In this assay, the change in fluorescence intensity (excitation wavelength 280 nm) was measured at the wavelength of maximum emission (330 nm for DsbG and 324 nm for DsbA). Experiments were carried out in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1.0 mm EDTA. Oxidized DsbG or DsbA (0.45 μm) was incubated at 25 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm GSSG and 0–2.0 mm GSH for 12 h before recording the fluorescence emission in an SLM-Aminco Luminescence Spectrometer (series 2). The equilibrium concentrations of GSH and GSSG were calculated according to Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, [GSH]=[GSH]0−2R[Dsb]0Equation 1 [GSSG]=[GSSG]0−R[Dsb]0Equation 2 R=(F−Fox)/(Fred−Fox)Equation 3 where [GSH]0 and [GSSG]0 are the initial concentrations of GSH and GSSG, R is the relative amount of reduced protein at equilibrium, [Dsb]0 is the initial concentration of DsbG or DsbA in the oxidized form,F is the measured fluorescence intensity, andF ox and F red are the fluorescence intensities of completely oxidized and reduced protein. The equilibrium constant K eq was estimated from nonlinear regression analysis of the data according to Equation 4(28Hawkins H.C. de Nardi M. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). R=([GSH]2/[GSSG]/)/(Keq+[GSH]2/[GSSG])Equation 4 Chemical cross-linking was used to determine the oligomeric state of DsbG. The reactions were performed by adding 0.1 volumes of Me2SO containing various concentrations (0–5 mm) of the amine cross-linker ethylene glycol-bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) (Pierce) to protein solutions containing 250 μg/ml of purified DsbG or DsbA. Each reaction was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and then quenched by the addition of glycine to 75 mm. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10–20% resolving gels), and the cross-linked products were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The ability of DsbA, DsbC, and DsbG to catalyze the reduction of human insulin (Sigma catalog no. I-5523) in the presence of DTT was tested as described previously by Holmgren (29Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A stock solution of 5 mminsulin was freshly prepared in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 2 mm EDTA before each assay. The reaction mixtures were prepared directly in cuvettes using 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mmEDTA, 131 μm insulin, and various concentrations of Dsb proteins (typically between 5 and 15 μm) in a final volume of 0.8 ml. The reactions were started by adding DTT to a final concentration of 0.35 mm. After thorough mixing, the cuvettes were placed in the spectrophotometer, and measurements were performed at 650 nm every 30 s. In all of the experiments, the uncatalyzed reduction of insulin by DTT was monitored in a control reaction without the addition of Dsb proteins. The preparation of fully reduced, denatured RNase and refolding assays were performed as described previously (30Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The recovery of ribonuclease activity resulting from oxidative renaturation was measured in a UV-visible spectrophotometer using cCMP as a substrate for the RNase. The reaction mixtures consisted of 50 mmTris acetate buffer, pH 8.0; 4.5 mm cCMP; GSH and GSSG (at predetermined concentrations to provide a redox buffer); pure DsbG or DsbC at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 μm or 1.5 μm bovine PDI as a positive control. After equilibrating the reaction at 25 °C, the assay was initiated by the addition of reduced, denatured RNase to a final concentration of 8 μm. Hydrolysis of cCMP by the refolded RNase was monitored every 30 s for 1 h as an increase in the absorbance at 296 nm. As a negative control, the uncatalyzed reaction was recorded in parallel under identical redox conditions. The concentration of active RNase at any time in each assay was calculated as described by Lyles and Gilbert (30Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A BLAST (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

The actual dsbGstart codon is 20 amino acids downstream of that identified here. having 49% similarity and 30% identity to 220 residues of the E. coliDsbC protein. Because of the high degree of similarity between DsbC and the identified hypothetical protein, we reasoned that it may have a role in the formation of disulfide bonds in the periplasmic space. While this work was in progress, Raina and co-workers (1Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) identified the same open reading frame in a genetic screen for resistance to dithiothreitol and named it dsbG (GenBankTMaccession no. AF000956). We cloned the complete 248-amino acid coding region of dsbG into a T7 expression vector fused to a 6× histidine tag and purified the expressed protein by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The N-terminal sequence of the mature purified protein was verified by automated Edman degradation, and cleavage of the signal peptide was shown to occur after Ala17. Antibodies were raised against the resulting material and used to probe a Western blot of whole cell extracts of E. coli not carrying any plasmids. A band of the expected mobility could be detected in lysates of exponential phase cells growing aerobically in rich media, but the corresponding band was not detected in strains in which the dsbG coding region had been deleted (see below). These results demonstrate that dsbG is indeed normally expressed in wild type cells under these conditions. The relative amounts of DsbG, DsbC, and DsbA in exponentially grown cells were determined by quantitative Western blotting, using serial dilutions of the respective purified proteins as standards. Immunoreacting proteins were visualized by ECLTM and quantified by densitometry. It was found that in strain MC4100, DsbG is present at approximately one-fourth the level of DsbC, which, in turn, is approximately 6-fold less abundant than DsbA (not shown). In earlier studies Andersen et al. (1Andersen C.L. Matthey-Dupraz A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) reported that adsbG::ΩTet mutation could be crossed onto the chromosome only when the cells were grown in the presence of low molecular weight oxidants such as cystine or oxidized DTT. Despite finding that a dsbG::ΩKan mutation could be transduced without supplementation of oxidants, they nevertheless hypothesized that this observation resulted from the accumulation of second site suppressor mutations. On the basis of these results, they concluded that mutations in dsbG are conditionally lethal. To evaluate this hypothesis, we first constructed a large deletion indsbG comprising 187 codons and marked it by the insertion of fragments of either 1.4 or 1.3 kbp containing, respectively, a CmR or a KanR gene. First, the CmR-marked dsbG deletion was integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination in arecD − strain. Hundreds of CmR, AmpS colonies were obtained, as expected for a gene that is not essential for viability. Colonies were picked at random and proven to contain ΔdsbG::Cm by PCR using the appropriate primers. Subsequently, the allele was transferred to different strains by P1 transduction. In a second approach, the ΔdsbG::Kan mutation was inserted into the suicide vector pBAD39 that can only replicate in cells grown in the presence of IPTG. The plasmid pBADΔdsbG::Kan was"

Little is known, however, about the characteristics of endothelial cell death in response to hypoxia. Using an in vitro model, we found that human umbilical vein endothelial cells were resistant to hypoxia-induced cell death with only a 2% reduction in viability at 24 h and 45% reduction in viability at 48 h. Overexpression of a mutant, IκBα, via adenoviral vector did not potentiate cell death in hypoxia, indicating that nuclear factor-κB activation was not involved in cytoprotection. Cell death in hypoxia was determined to be apoptotic by 3′ labeling of DNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase staining and reversibility of cell death with a caspase inhibitor. Exposure of endothelial cells to hypoxia did not alter levels of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bcl-XL by immunoblot analysis. In contrast, changes in p53 protein levels correlated with the induction of apoptosis in hypoxic endothelial cells. Inhibition of the proteasome increased p53 protein levels and accelerated cell death in hypoxia. Overexpression of p53 by adenoviral transduction was sufficient to initiate apoptosis of normoxic endothelial cells. These data provide a framework for the study of factors regulating endothelial cell survival and death in hypoxia. Endothelial cell death may contribute to tissue injury from ischemia.

Endothelial cell (EC)1 death may contribute to the hypoxic as well as the reperfusion components of this injury. The mechanisms of cell death in hypoxia are not known but may involve calcium influx, derangements in mitochondrial function, or purine nucleotide depletion (1Hochachka P. Buck L. Doll C. Land S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9493-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 2Tretyakov A. Farber H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 738-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Limited studies suggest a role for apoptosis induced by the tumor suppressor gene p53 in hypoxia-induced cell death. Graeber et al. (3Graeber T. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D. Koch C. Lowe S. Giaccia A. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar) found that tumor cells containing wild-type p53 were more sensitive to hypoxia-induced apoptosis when compared with tumor cells lacking functional p53. Longet al. (4Long X. Boluyt A. Hipolito B. Lundberg M. Zheng J.-S. O'Neil L. Cirielli C. Lakatta E. Crow M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) showed a role for p53 in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in response to hypoxia. In contrast, Amellem et al. (5Amellem O. Stokke T. Sandvik J. Smedshammer L. Pettersen E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) demonstrated that hypoxia-induced apoptosis occurred independent of p53 protein level in MCF-7 cells. There are few data, however, on the relative susceptibility of EC to hypoxia-induced cell death or the molecular mechanisms involved. Because EC are invariably exposed to hypoxia in ischemic conditions, this question has important therapeutic implications for the prevention of ischemic tissue damage.We used an in vitro model to examine mechanisms of EC death during hypoxia. We found that EC underwent significant cell death with features of apoptosis only after exposure to 48 h of hypoxia. Inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation by adenoviral-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative IκBα mutant did not potentiate apoptosis in hypoxic EC. There was no correlation between Bax/Bcl-XL ratios and cell death. However, there was an increase in p53 protein levels concomitant with EC death. In addition, overexpression of wild-type p53 protein in EC by adenoviral gene transduction was sufficient to cause apoptosis. We conclude that a major component of EC death in response to hypoxia is attributable to apoptosis. EC survival in hypoxia does not appear to depend on the activation of an NF-κB-dependent pathway(s). Apoptosis in hypoxia correlated with p53 protein levels but not with alterations in Bcl-XL and Bax proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and ReagentsHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from umbilical cords with collagenase as described previously (6Jaffe E. Nachman R. Becker C. Minick C. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5984) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% bovine calf serum (Sigma), maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and used at passage 2–3. Hypoxia was induced by placement of cells in an anaerobic chamber (Plaslabs, Lansing, MI) filled with 5% CO2, 85% N2, and 10% H2 and heated to 37 °C. O2 concentration was maintained at <14 torr as measured by a Clark electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument, Yellow Springs, OH) by the catalytic conversion of O2 and H2 to H2O by palladium crystals. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) (7Ades E. Candal F. Swerlick R. George V. Summers S. Bosse D. Lawley T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift of Dr. E Ades (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA) and Dr. T. Lawley (Emory University, Atlanta, GA) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and endothelial cell growth factor (25 μg/ml) prepared from bovine hypothalamus. Construction of HMEC-bclx and HMEC-neo has been previously described (8Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was purchased from R & D systems (Minneapolis, MN). 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), calpain inhibitor I (ALLN) and calpain inhibitor II (N-acetyl-leu-leu-methioninal) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-p53, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-XL, and anti-Bax antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) was purchased from Kamiya Bio Co. (Seattle, WA). An Apotag kit was purchased from Oncor (Gaithersburg, MD).Construction of Recombinant AdenovirusConstruction of the p53 adenovirus carrying the human wild-type p53 gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promotor has been described previously (9Xiang H. Hochman D. Saya H. Fujiwara T. Schwartzkroin P. Morrison R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6753-6765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IκBα mutant (serine to alanine at 32 and 36 residues) cDNA was kindly provided by Drs. M. Karin and J. DiDonato (University of California, San Diego, CA) (10DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA was inserted into the vector pXCJL1 under the transcriptional control of the phosphoglycerokinase promoter, upstream of the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. The E1A-deficient recombinant adenovirus was generated similar to the previously described generation of recombinant control adenovirus Ad-Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase (11Stratford-Perricoudet L. Makeh I. Perricoudet M. Briand P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Briefly, E1A-deficient adenovirus was recombined with the pXCJL.1-IκBα mutant plasmid and pJM17 in 293 cells. Purification of a large batch of the recombinant adenovirus was done by two consecutive cesium chloride centrifugations with storage at −80 °C in 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm MgCl2.Infection of HUVECSubconfluent HUVEC were washed once with warmed complete medium and incubated at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) indicated with control adenovirus (AdLacZ), p53 adenovirus (Adp53), or mutant IκBα adenovirus (AdIkBm) in complete medium.Immunoblot AnalysisAfter experimental treatment of HUVEC in 100-mm plates, cell monolayers were detached from plastic culture dishes with a cell scraper, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 50 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40 with 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein was collected by microcentrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. Cytosolic extracts from treated HUVEC were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose in 25 mmTris, 192 mm glycine, and 5% methanol at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C. Filters were blocked overnight with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% skim milk. Immunoblots were analyzed for p53 using antiserum at a 1:1000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were detected according to the enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-goat secondary antiserum. Blots were exposed to film for 1–10 min. Immunoblotting for Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax was identical except for the use of an anti-hamster second antibody for Bcl-2 and anti-rabbit second antibody for the others.Detection of ApoptosisDNA LadderEndothelial cells were removed from tissue culture plates by a 2-min incubation with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution and pelleted and resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS followed by incubation with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 4 h at 37 °C. DNA was extracted using phenol and chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA) and treated with DNase-free RNase for 3 h at 37 °C. The DNA was ethanol precipitated and resuspended in distilled water. The concentration of DNA was measured by spectrophotometer, and 4 μg was fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. We evaluated the electrophoretic patterns of DNA extracted from cells subjected to hypoxia as well as normoxia. HUVEC were exposed to hypoxia for 24, 36, or 48 h, whereas hepatoma cells were exposed for 4, 12, or 24 h.Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated Biotinylated UTP Nick End Labeling StainingThe 3′ ends of DNA were labeled according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Briefly, endothelial cells were removed from tissue culture as described above with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution, isolated by centrifugation, resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed on ice for 15 min. Cells were washed twice, resuspended in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and held at −20 °C until ready for use. The 3′ ends of DNA had digoxigenin nucleotides catalytically coupled to them using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Digoxigenin was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody, and total DNA was determined by staining with propridium iodide. Double staining allowed simultaneous display of viable and apoptotic cells. Cells that stained positive for both fluorescein isothiocyanate and propridium iodide were considered to be apoptotic and those that stained only with propridium iodide were considered normal. The percent apoptotic cells was determined as the ratio of cells positive for fluorescein isothiocyanate relative to those positive for propridium iodide. Specimens were analyzed on an Epic XL cytometer (Coulter, Fullerton, CA). At least 20,000 events were evaluated.MTT AssayThe MTT assay of cell viability was performed as described previously (8Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment, medium containing 1 mg/ml MTT was added to cells for a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. The medium was aspirated, and the formazan product was solubilized with dimethyl sulfoxide. Absorbance at 630 nm (background absorbance) was subtracted from absorbance at 570 nm for each well.Nucleosome Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)Nucleosome ELISA (Calbiochem, Cambridge, MA) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were treated with adenoviral constructs and then harvested and lysed at appropriate time points. After freezing lysates at −20 °C for at least 18 h, specimens were thawed and pipetted into wells of a pretreated ELISA plate. The plate was then incubated with detector antibody followed by streptavidin conjugate. After washing, substrate solution was added, and plates were incubated in the dark for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with stop solution, and absorbance was measured on a plate reader at dual wavelengths of 450 and 595 nm.Northern AnalysisHUVEC were subjected to normoxia or hypoxia, and RNA was extracted at 2, 8, 18, 24, and 36 h with Trizol (Life Technologies) per the manufacturer. Total cellular RNA was separated on agarose-fromaldehyde gels, blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes for A1 (8Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) or A20 (gift of V. Dixit, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA).Statistical AnalysisAnalysis for statistical significance was performed on Excel using Student's paired t test.RESULTSHUVEC were found to be relatively resistant to hypoxia-induced cell death. The MTT assay revealed 98% viability after 24 h and 55% viability after 48 h of continuous exposure to <14 torr of oxygen (Fig. 1). HUVEC death was evaluated by several techniques to determine whether this death was apoptotic in nature. Significant DNA laddering was present after 48 h of exposure of HUVEC to hypoxia but was not seen in control HUVEC at the same time point (Fig. 2). Approximately 35% of cells were apoptotic when evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling staining at 48 h (Fig. 3). In contrast, RH7777 hepatoma cells, previously shown to be sensitive to hypoxia-induced apoptosis (12Arora A. deGroen P. Croall D. Emori Y. Gores G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), underwent significant apoptosis after only 12 h of exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 3).Figure 2HUVEC death in hypoxia is associated with DNA laddering. HUVEC exposed to hypoxia or normoxia for 24 and 48 h were lysed, and DNA was extracted. DNA was fractionated by electrophoresis and stained by ethidium bromide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3HUVEC are more resistant to hypoxia-induced apoptosis than hepatoma cells. Annexin V binding to HUVEC and rat hepatoma cells (RH7777) was performed at various time points after exposure to hypoxia. Approximately 35% of HUVEC were apoptotic at 48 h. Values represent the means ± S.E. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The caspase family of proteases is thought to be the final execution pathway in apoptosis (13Patel T. Gores G. Kaufmann S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). To establish the role of the caspase pathway in hypoxia-induced apoptosis of EC, we treated HUVEC with the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (14Jacobsen M. Weil M. Raff M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that pretreatment of HUVEC with zVAD-fmk largely prevented cell death seen after 48 h of hypoxia, further establishing that hypoxia-induced death of EC is apoptotic.The experiments represented by Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 established the time course of EC death in hypoxia and confirmed that it was attributable primarily to apoptosis. Next, we examined the role of two Bcl-2 family members in the response of EC to hypoxia. Based on studies in other cell types demonstrating changes in Bcl-2/Bax ratios with apoptosis (15Yang E. Korsmeyer S. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we performed immunoblot analysis of Bcl-XL and Bax protein levels in response to hypoxia. These proteins were chosen because they have been shown to be the predominant cytoprotective and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in HUVEC (16Karsan A. Yee E. Poirier G. Zhou P. Craig R. Harlan J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1775-1784PubMed Google Scholar), There was no significant change in their ratios after 24 h of hypoxia in three successive experiments (Fig. 4). Northern blot analysis for the inducible EC cytoprotective molecules A1 and A20 also showed no change in mRNA levels after exposure to hypoxia (data not shown). As we have previously shown (16Karsan A. Yee E. Poirier G. Zhou P. Craig R. Harlan J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1775-1784PubMed Google Scholar), Bcl-2 protein was barely detectable in HUVEC and showed no increase by immunoblot analysis in response to hypoxia (data not shown).Figure 4Bax and Bcl-XL protein levels and ratios do not change during hypoxia. Immunoblot analysis for Bax and Bcl-XL protein was performed at 6, 12, and 24 h after exposure to hypoxia.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Having excluded that hypoxia-induced changes in the protein levels of the predominant Bcl-2 family members expressed in HUVEC accounted for initiation of apoptosis, we next determined whether p53 protein levels were altered before cell death. Fig.5 shows an immunoblot analysis of lysates of HUVEC exposed to normoxia or progressively longer periods of hypoxia. Minimal levels of p53 protein were present in normoxia or early in hypoxia. However, there was a significant increase in p53 protein level by 24 h of hypoxia.Figure 5p53 protein levels increase with hypoxia and are potentiated by a proteasome inhibitor. Immunoblot analysis of p53 protein was performed at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after exposure to hypoxia in the absence or presence of the proteasome inhibitor ALLN (100 μm). Three separate experiments yielded identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The proteasome, a multicatalytic protein involved in intracellular protein turnover (17Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), is known to contribute to the normally short half-life (20 min) of p53 protein (18Maki C. Huibregtse J. Howley P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of the proteasome inhibitor ALLN, which inhibits p53 degradation (19Dietrich C. Barstch T. Schanz F. Oesch F. Wieser R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10815-10819Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) caused an accelerated accumulation of p53 protein in hypoxic HUVEC (Fig. 5). Concomitant with its ability to cause an early increase in p53 protein levels, treatment of hypoxic HUVEC with ALLN resulted in a potentiation of hypoxia-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6). There was complete loss of viability of nearly all hypoxic ALLN-treated HUVEC at 24 h. In contrast, treatment of normoxic HUVEC with ALLN for 24 h did not cause significant toxicity (Fig. 6). This effect was not attributable to the inhibitory effects of ALLN on calpain, because the related calpain inhibitor II, a weak inhibitor of the proteasome (20Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K.

Studies with an adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (AdLacZ) showed near 100% infection efficiency after 48 h of exposure to 500 m.o.i. of AdLacZ (data not shown). These data are comparable to the m.o.i. used by others for adenoviral mediated transduction of EC (22Ferran C. Stroka D. Badrichani A. Cooper J. Wrighton C. Soares M. Grey S. Bach F. Blood. 1998; 91: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of normoxic HUVEC infected with 500 m.o.i. of an adenovirus encoding p53 (Adp53) showed increased levels of p53 protein 24 h after infection compared with uninfected cells and cells infected with AdLacZ (Fig.8). There was a marked reduction in HUVEC viability in normoxia as early as 48 h after infection with Adp53 and near complete loss of viability 72 h after infection (Fig.9 A). Viability of AdLacZ-infected normoxic cells was similar to control, uninfected HUVEC. Phase contrast microscopy showed a normal cobblestone appearance of AdLacZ-infected cells compared with detachment, membrane blebbing, and cellular fragmentation of HUVEC 72 h after infection with 500 m.o.i. of Adp53. Experiments performed with Adp53- and AdLacZ-infected cells in hypoxic conditions showed complete loss of viability of Adp53-infected cells within 24 h of exposure to hypoxia (data not shown). Measurement of free nucleosomes was performed under identical conditions to evaluate whether this death was predominantly attributable to apoptosis (Fig. 9 B). Confirmation that Adp53-induced death was dependent in part on caspase activation was established through the use of the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk. Pretreatment of HUVEC with ZVAD-fmk partially reversed the loss of viability seen with Adp53 treatment (Fig.10).Figure 8Infection with Adp53 results in high levels of p53 protein expression.

Neish A. Luscinskas F. Palombella V. Maniatis T. Collins T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 493-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To determine whether potentiation of hypoxia-induced apoptosis of EC by ALLN was in part caused by inhibition of NF-κB, an adenoviral construct encoding a mutant form of IκBα (IkBm) was used. Serine residues 33 and 36 are converted to alanine in the mutant protein, preventing phosphorylation. The overexpressed mutant protein cannot be degraded by the proteasome but remains bound to NF-κB in the cytoplasm, inhibiting its translocation to the nucleus (10DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that this strategy was effective in inhibiting NF-κB-mediated transcription, assessment of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in response to TNF-α stimulation was measured by ELISA. As previously shown in our lab, 2K. Zen, A. Karsan, A. Stempien-Otero, E. Yee, M. A. Kay, C. B. Wilson, and J. M. Harlan, submitted for publication. control HUVEC and HUVEC infected with AdLacZ exhibited appropriate increases in VCAM expression after 18-h treatment with TNF-α (10 ng/ml), whereas HUVEC infected with AdIκBm for 24 h showed complete inhibition of VCAM-1 protein expression in response to TNF-α (Fig. 11). To ensure maximal inhibition of NF-κB activity, HUVEC were exposed to AdIκBm or AdLacZ at 1000 m.o.i. for 72 h before exposure to hypoxia. Although lower levels of AdIκBm were sufficient to inhibit TNF-induced VCAM expression, longer exposures at higher m.o.i. were necessary to completely abrogate the cytoprotective effect of NF-κB under TNF stimulation. Overexpression of the mutant IκB did not change the extent of EC apoptosis in response to hypoxia at 24 h (Fig.12). Longer treatments with either AdLacZ or AdIκBm resulted in equivalent cytotoxicity compared with uninfected cells. As reported by others, addition of TNF-α to both control and hypoxic EC treated with an inhibitor of NF-κB translocation resulted in significant loss of viability of these HUVEC compared with AdLacZ-infected or noninfected cells at 24 h (22Ferran C. Stroka D. Badrichani A. Cooper J. Wrighton C. Soares M. Grey S. Bach F. Blood. 1998; 91: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, although NF-κB activation is necessary for survival in response to TNF-α, it does not appear to play a role in survival during hypoxia.Figure 11Inhibition of NF-κB abrogates VCAM-1 induction by TNF-α. HUVEC were untreated (Control) or infected with 1000 m.o.i. AdLacz or AdIκBm for 24 h then treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 18 h. VCAM-1 expression was then assessed by ELISA.

Assimilation of sulfate occurs in five enzymatic steps. First, it is activated to adenylylsulfate (APS)1 and 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate (PAPS) by ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase. PAPS is then reduced to sulfite by PAPS reductase and sulfite is reduced to sulfide by sulfite reductase. Finally, cysteine is formed when sulfide is incorporated intoO-acetyl-l-serine (OAS) by OAS-(thiol)lyase. The enzyme 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate (PAPS) reductase (EC 1.8.99.4) catalyzes the first reductive step in this sequence. It uses thioredoxin (Trx) or glutaredoxin (Grx) as in vitro hydrogen donor for the reduction of 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate to free sulfite.

(1Wilson L.G. Asahi T. Bandurski R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1822-1829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gonzalez-Porqué et al. (2Gonzales Porqué P. Baldesten A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2371-2374PubMed Google Scholar) identified thioredoxin as reductant while investigating methionine sulfoxide and sulfate reduction in yeast. Glutaredoxin as the alternate cofactor was found by Tsang and Schiff (3Tsang M.L.-S. Schiff J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 131-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a thioredoxin-negative mutant. InEscherichia coli, thioredoxin or glutaredoxin is essential for sulfate reduction but not for the reduction of ribonucleotides as deletion or inactivation of both the genes trxA andgrxA caused cysteine auxotrophy but allowed growth on minimal medium (4Russel M. Model P. Holmgren A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When supplied with cysteine the Trx-Grx double mutants were still viable implying that they contained a reductant that could substitute for thioredoxin or glutaredoxin in ribonucleotide reduction. The search for alternate reductant(s) led the isolation of two new glutaredoxins, termed Grx2 and Grx3 (5Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) re-addresses also the question to their possible function as electron donors of the PAPS reductase. In addition to the original observations by Gonzalez-Porqué et al. (2Gonzales Porqué P. Baldesten A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2371-2374PubMed Google Scholar) and Tsang (10Tsang M.L.-S. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that thioredoxin and glutaredoxin can serve as reductant in partially purified preparations, cumulative evidence from earlier investigations suggested that PAPS reductase from E. coli could in fact be used to detect thioredoxins from different origins (11Wagner W. Follmann H. Schmidt A. Z. Naturforsch. 1978; 33c: 517-520Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and of different biochemical properties (12Schwenn J.D. Schriek U. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42c: 93-102Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recently a homogeneous PAPS reductase from E. coli was investigated in greater detail defining its reaction mechanism (13Berendt U. Haverkamp T. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and its three-dimensional structure (14Savage H. Montoya G. Svensson C. Schwenn J.D. Sinning I. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 895-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Structural and functional data established a ping-pong mechanism for the enzyme homodimer in which thioredoxin reduced the enzyme in a first reaction forming a stable reduced enzyme isoform that is oxidized by PAPS as a second reactant to give sulfite and adenosine 3′,5′-bis-phosphate (PAP). A highly conserved cysteine residue in an ECGLH-motif near the C terminus was recognized as the reactive nucleophile of the enzyme. No evidence for an intermediary thioredoxin S:SO3 or a catalytically competent enzyme substrate complex was obtained making thioredoxin operate as a protein disulfide reductase. PAPS reductase is specific for PAPS and thioredoxin as the electron donor cannot be replaced by monothiols like glutathione or artificial dithiols like dithiothreitol. Until today, all previous data concerning thioredoxin as the electron donor of the PAPS reductase were obtained with a protein that is now designated as thioredoxin 1 (Trx1). In this study, we could extend these investigations using glutaredoxin1 (Grx1) and the newly discovered glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2), glutaredoxin 3 (Grx3), and thioredoxin 2 (Trx2). The major aim was to compare their function as substrate of PAPS reductase and to evaluate their specificity as hydrogen donor.

Plasmid pET16bcysH is a derivative of pET16b (Novagen) used for cloning of a 733-base pair cysH polymerase chain reaction fragment from pUB5 (13Berendt U. Haverkamp T. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotides PRNdeI (5′-GTGAGGAACATATGTCCAAAC-3′) and PRBglIIrev (5′-CCGGCAAGA-TCTACCCTTCG-3′). Transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were grown in complete LB medium at pH 7.5 containing 100 μg · ml−1 ampicillin (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The medium was supplemented with 2% glycerol when the bacteria were grown in a fermenter. The fermenter (Meredos, Göttingen) was inoculated with a mid log phase culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) at a concentration of 2% (v/v) harboring plasmid pET16bcysH. Cells were grown under vigorous aeration at 32 °C. Expression of cysH was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm when the cells had reached a density of A 595 0.7. The cells were collected within 2–3 h after induction by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min and washed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The yield was 2.5 g liter−1. Bacteria (0.06 g ml−1 in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) were disrupted by two passages through a French press (Ribi Cell Fractionator) applying 14.2 MPa at 5 °C. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min and applied to TALON affinity resin (CLONTECH, Heidelberg). His10-tagged protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole. Its purity was examined by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar) and laser mass spectroscopy (17Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1990; 62: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The average yield per liter of broth was 14 mg PAPS reductase using LB medium. Recombinant Trx1 was purchased from MBI Fermentas (St.Leon-Roth). Trx2 was expressed and purified using the method of Miranda-Vizuete et al. (6Miranda-Vizuete A. Damidimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J.A.

Naturforsch. 1987; 42c: 93-102Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each individual determination of the reaction velocity was averaged from two identical samples. The kinetic constants were calculated from three sets of data with the lowest error derived from six different concentrations of PAPS versusfive different concentrations of reductant. The assay mixture contained 100–750 ng ml−1 of purified PAPS reductase, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmNa2SO3, 0.5–60 μm[35S]PAPS (specific radioactivity: 1700 Bq × nmol−1), 0.5–50 μm thioredoxin kept reduced by 10–25 mm dithiotreitiol, or 0.5–50 μmglutaredoxin kept reduced by 10–25 mm reduced glutathione. [35S]PAPS was prepared enzymatically from [35S]SO42- (Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig) using recombinant His10-APS kinase fromArabidopsis thaliana (22.Schiffmann, S. (1998) Ph.D. thesis Faculty of Biology, Bochum.Google Scholar). The reaction system contained ATP-sulfurylase and inorganic pyrophosphatase from Sigma (München), pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate from Boehringer Mannheim as described by Schriek and Schwenn (23Schriek U. Schwenn J.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PAPS synthesis was monitored by high performance liquid chromatography as described by Schwenn and Jender (24Schwenn J.D. Jender H.G. J. Chromatogr. 1980; 139: 285-290Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Isolation, restriction, and cloning of DNA, agarose gel electrophoresis, and polymerase chain reaction were performed according to Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed according to Hanahan (25Hanahan D. Glover D.M. DNA cloning. I. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 109-135Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was done with an automated DNA sequencer using Auto Read sequencing kit (Pharmacia, Freiburg) with fluorescein-labeled primers. Annealing temperatures for oligonucleotides were calculated depending on their G:C content. The concentration of proteins was determined colorimetrically using Coomassie Brillant Blue (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar) or from a Warburg and Christian nomogram (27Warburg O. Christian W. Biochem. Z. 1941; 310: 384-421Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was run on 12.5% gels replacing β-mercaptoethanol by dithiothreitol. Polyclonal anti-PAPS reductase antibodies from rabbit (28Krone F.A. Westphal G. Schwenn J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were used to detect the protein by Western immunoblotting (29Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipates were visualized on nitrocellulose BA-S 85 (Schleicher & Schuell) by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. 4-Chloro-1-naphtol in methanol was used for staining. PAPS reductase as a His10-tag fusion protein was purified by chelate affinity chromatography yielding a homogeneous and enzymatically active protein in a single step. The method used previously by Berendt et al. (13Berendt U. Haverkamp T. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) involved several chromatographic steps including hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and dye matrix affinity chromatography on blue- and red-Sepharose. The His-tagged fusion protein is pure as judged by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant protein (Fig.1, A and B). By laser mass spectroscopy (17Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1990; 62: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), we could confirm that the His10-tagged PAPS reductase was expressed as unmodified protein with a mono-isotopic mass of 30634.4 as expected (data not shown). The mass spectroscopy also indicated the presence of a by-product with a mass peak that differed by 149.3 daltons. It is assumed that the difference in isotopic mass of this by-product very likely was caused by a His10-tag PAPS reductase lacking the N-terminal methionine. Optimized reaction conditions for the PAPS reductase were found at a pH value of 9.2–9.3. The rate of reaction increased by a factor of 1.93 per Δ10 °C interval from 18 to 35 °C provided that the concentration of enzyme was maintained below 750 ng ml−1of purified protein. Under these conditions, less than 20% of the substrate is converted if the reaction time is kept ≤180 s (data not shown). Rates obtained under these conditions were taken as initial velocity. The molecular activity of the His10-tagged protein was 3.5 s−1 per catalytic center compared with 0.05 s−1 reported earlier for the recombinant untagged enzyme (13Berendt U. Haverkamp T. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We know now that the lower specific activity of the recombinant untagged enzyme was due to a high proportion of inactive protein, which copurified with the intact enzyme protein. Laser mass spectroscopy and refinement of the three-dimensional structure showed that this truncated protein lacked fourteen amino acids of the C terminus including the functionally important cysteine, whereas thirteen residues at the truncated terminus were disordered and could not be located (14Savage H. Montoya G. Svensson C. Schwenn J.D. Sinning I. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 895-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have reason to believe that this truncated protein was already produced by the host TG1 transformed with the pBTac derivative pUB5. The new His10-tagged protein described here was produced in BL21(DE3) using a pET16b vector (Novagen) giving rise to a complete and enzymatically active PAPS reductase without removal of the His10-tag fusion. The Michaelis constants were determined with the concentration of PAPS near saturating (2.5–30 μm) and that of Trx1 slightly limiting to near saturating (1–20 μm). Double reciprocal plots produced a set of parallel lines indicating a ping-pong type reaction mechanism. The set of lines produced a common intersect on they axis above the origin when the data were plotted in a Hanes-Woolf plot. The slopes were replotted to giveV max and K m (Fig.2, A and B). Kinetic constants for Grx1 were determined accordingly (Fig.3, A and B).In vitro, Trx1 is effectively replaced by Grx1, which supported the rate of sulfite formation at a comparable rate (6.8–6.6 units mg−1 versus 5.4–4.8 units mg−1 using Grx1). A lack of effect upon the Michaelis constant for PAPS may have been expected, because only the reduced enzyme isomer can react with the substrate but it is also noteworthy that the K m values for Trx1 or Grx1 were virtually identical. When thioredoxin and glutaredoxin are compared as reductants of the ribonucleotide reductase, Grx1 with its 10-fold lowerK m, appeared to be more predominant in vivo. It also appears more specific because it did not reduce structural disulfides though both reductants were reported to support a similar V max (30Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3664-3671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, the estimated intracellular concentration of Trx (10 μm) is higher compared with a 10-fold lower one for Grx1 (32Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. Lopez-Barea J.

The K m values were extracted from slope replots of the corresponding Hanes-Woolf plots assuming a ping-pong bireactant enzyme mechanism. The deviation is given as standard deviation. When Trx2 was used as reductant, V max was not significantly affected, but K m increased 2.4-fold to 34.2 μm. The higher K m for Trx2 may be seen as an indication of a slightly disturbed contact in the charge transfer complex between enzyme and reductant. Hence, the enzyme rate supported by Trx2 may be sufficient for heterotrophic growth, but the low level of expression of Trx2 reported by Miranda-Vizuete et al. (6Miranda-Vizuete A. Damidimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) may be the reason why Trx1/Grx1 double mutants score as cysteine auxotrophs. This explanation is supported with the recent finding that overexpression of Trx2 enables a trxA grxAdouble mutant to grow on minimal medium without the supplement of cysteine (33Stewart E.J. Åslund F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Miranda-Vizuete et al. (6Miranda-Vizuete A. Damidimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) also described a 5-fold lower activity of Trx2 in comparison with Trx1 in the insulin disulfide reductase assay. As pre-reduction of Trx2 with dithiothreitol or deletion of an N-terminal extension containing two additional CXXC motifs increased its activity considerably the authors proposed that the two CXXC motifs present in Trx2 control the disulfide reductase activity by their redox state. In the PAPS reductase assay the redox state of Trx2 had no effect upon the enzymatic activity, because pre-incubation with dithiothreitol did not stimulate the rate of sulfite formation. Grx2 and Grx3 were both inactive as hydrogen donors for PAPS reductase, whereas the Grx1 mutant C14S retained 6% of the wild type activity (330 milliunits mg−1) with a slightly increased affinity as reflected in a lower K m of 7.2 μm. A reduction of the homodimeric PAPS reductase by Grx1C14S seems noteworthy, because it would lead to a possibly transient glutaredoxin enzyme-mixed disulfide that becomes accessible to reduced glutathione. Indeed, the monothiol mutant retained 38% of the wild-type protein in the glutathione disulfide oxidoreductase assay but was completely inactive as hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase (19Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wüthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The lack of activity observed with Grx2 is not surprising because of its unusual structure (20Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Spyrou G. Bergmann T. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Grx3, however, shares a 33% overall identity with Grx1 and contains several patches of identical residues that have been identified as indispensable for redox functions (34Bushweller J.H. Billeter M. Holmgren A. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1585-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 35Åslund F. Nordstrand K. Berndt K.D. Nikkola M. Bergmann T. Ponstingl H. Jornvall H. Otting G. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6736-6745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, the secondary and tertiary structure of both glutaredoxins were found to be very similar (35Åslund F. Nordstrand K. Berndt K.D. Nikkola M. Bergmann T. Ponstingl H. Jornvall H. Otting G. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6736-6745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the vicinal active site cysteine residues in Grx3 are surrounded by charged amino acids that differ significantly from the residues in Grx1 (34Bushweller J.H. Billeter M. Holmgren A. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1585-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This may have an influence on the redox potential of Grx3, which is more positive than Grx1 and on the area of contact in hydrophobic protein-protein interactions. A positive potential surrounding the negative charge of the thiolate of the active site most certainly is necessary to guide the protruding end of the Grx molecule toward its substrate buried in the catalytic site of the enzyme. Our results give an explanation for the essential role of Trx1 or Grx1 for the growth of E. coli on minimal medium containing sulfate as the only source of sulfur (4Russel M. Model P. Holmgren A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because the apparentK m values of Trx1 and Grx1 are similar (approximately 14 μm) and much higher than the corresponding values for ribonucleotide reductase (30Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3664-3671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3672-3678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the sulfate reduction pathway would seem less favored than that of ribonucleotide reduction, which is essential for DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the even higher apparent K m value for Trx2 and its relatively low expression level (6Miranda-Vizuete A. Damidimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) makes this new thioredoxin a poor electron donor to PAPS reductase in particular when the full demand is on to supply DNA replication with the essential deoxyribonucleotides.

https://openalex.org/W2004345371,"We previously showed that rat liver betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) mRNA content and activity increased 4-fold when rats were fed a methionine-deficient diet containing adequate choline, compared with rats fed the same diet with control levels of methionine (Park, E. I., Renduchintala, M. S., and Garrow, T. A. (1997) J. Nutr. Biochem.8, 541–545). A further 2-fold increase was observed in rats fed the methionine-deficient diet with supplemental betaine. The nutrition studies reported here were designed to determine whether other methyl donors would induce rat liver BHMT gene expression when added to a methionine-deficient diet and to define the relationship between the degree of methionine restriction and level of methyl donor intake on BHMT expression. Therefore, rats were fed amino acid-defined diets varying in methionine and methyl donor composition. The effect of diet on BHMT expression was evaluated using Northern, Western, and enzyme activity analyses. Similar to when betaine was added to a methionine-deficient diet, choline or sulfonium analogs of betaine induced BHMT expression. The diet-induced induction of hepatic BHMT activity was mediated by increases in the steady-state level of its mRNA and immunodetectable protein. Using methyl donor-free diets, we found that methionine restriction was required but alone not sufficient for the high induction of BHMT expression. Concomitant with methionine restriction, dietary methyl groups were required for high levels of BHMT induction, and a dose-dependent relationship was observed between methyl donor intake and BHMT induction. Furthermore, the severity of methionine restriction influenced the magnitude of BHMT induction.To study the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of BHMT, we have cloned the human BHMT gene. This gene spans about 20 kilobases of DNA and contains 8 exons and 7 introns. Using RNA isolated from human liver and hepatoma cells, a major transcriptional start site has been mapped using the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique, and this start site is 26 nucleotides downstream from a putative TATA box.

Betaine is an intermediate of choline oxidation, and the enzymes of this pathway are primarily found in the liver and kidney of mammals (1Sunden L.F.S. Renduchintala M.S. Park E.I. Miklasz S.D. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), although we have recently shown that BHMT is also expressed in the lenses of rhesus monkeys and humans (2Rao P.V. Garrow T.A. John F. Garland D. Millian N.S. Zigler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30669-30674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This enzyme has recently been shown to be zinc-dependent (3Millian N.S. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and based on protein purification reports, it has been estimated that BHMT represents 0.5–2% of the total soluble protein in mammalian liver (4Garrow T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22831-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although these studies presumably used livers from animals that were consuming diets containing adequate Met, it is possible that BHMT can represent an even greater proportion of liver protein, because as reported here, when choline-containing diets are deficient in Met, there occur dramatic increases in hepatic BHMT protein content. However, regardless of dietary conditions, it is clear that BHMT is a major zinc metalloenzyme in liver.Interest in the nutrient and genetic factors that influence Hcy metabolism has increased because elevated concentrations of this amino acid in blood have been correlated to the incidence of arteriosclerotic vascular disease and thrombosis. BHMT is one of two known mammalian enzymes that methylate Hcy, the other being the folate/vitamin B12-dependent Met synthase (EC 2.1.1.13). Of these two methyltransferases, it is known that genetic defects that reduce the flux through the Met synthase catalyzed reaction, or a deficient intake of either of its coenzyme vitamin precursors, result in elevated concentrations of blood Hcy (5Rosenblatt D.S.

Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 3029-3049Google Scholar). Whether BHMT is required for normal Hcy metabolism is not known, because choline, the metabolic precursor of betaine, is not an essential nutrient unless the level of Met in the diet is severely deficient. Under normal nutritional status, the choline moiety can be synthesized by theS-adenosylmethionine-dependent conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. A naturally occurring combined deficiency of Met and choline has not been described in humans and is not likely to occur because choline, primarily as phosphatidylcholine, is abundant in human diets. Furthermore, to date, there have been no inherited defects in the BHMT-catalyzed reaction described, and therefore, it has not been possible to ascertain whether such defects perturb Hcy metabolism in humans.Although the significance of BHMT in Hcy homeostasis is not clear, it is known that the relative contribution of BHMT to Hcy remethylation can be influenced by diet. For example, it has been shown that the rate of Hcy remethylation is increased when choline or betaine is added to the diet of humans (7Mudd S.H. Poole J.R. Metabolism. 1975; 24: 721-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 8Mudd S.H. Ebert M.H. Scriver C.R.

As previously indicated by Mudd (11Mudd S.H. Graham I. Refsum H. Rosenberg I.H. Ueland P.M. Homocysteine Metabolism: From Basic Science to Clinical Medicine. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1997: 77-82Google Scholar), these studies suggest that betaine concentrations in human liver are below that required to saturate BHMT, and present knowledge of hepatic betaine concentrations and the Michaelis constants of betaine for the human enzyme support this idea (3Millian N.S. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In vitro studies designed to simulate Hcy metabolism in rat liver suggest that BHMT and Met synthase contribute equally to the conversion of Hcy to Met in that organ (12Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9508-9513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that when a diet is otherwise nutritionally adequate, Met restriction dramatically elevates rat liver BHMT gene expression (13Park E.I. Renduchintala M.S. Garrow T.A. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1997; 8: 541-545Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This dietary induction of BHMT gene expression presumably enhances the methylation of the available Hcyin vivo, thus conserving the nutritionally essential carbon backbone of Hcy under conditions of Met deficiency. All of these studies suggest that BHMT has a quantitatively significant role in the hepatic conversion of Hcy to Met, although its significance in whole-body Hcy remethylation remains speculative.The purpose of the nutrition studies reported here is to further clarify the interaction between dietary Met restriction and methyl donor intake on rat liver BHMT gene expression. We report here that dramatic changes in BHMT expression can be elicited when rats consume diets deficient in Met yet rich in methyl donor, i.e.choline, betaine, or sulfonium analogs of betaine. As an initial step to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that mediate any of the nutritional, hormonal, and tissue-specific expression of BHMT, and to ultimately characterize human genetic variants at the BHMT locus, we have characterized the organization of the human BHMT gene. Here, we report the intron-exon splice junctions of the gene, report the major transcriptional start site, and provide 3.2 kilobases of DNA sequence 5′ to this transcriptional start site.DISCUSSIONCholine may be a significant source of one carbon units in metabolism because it is abundant in human diets and its oxidation interfaces with Met and methylenetetrahydrofolate synthesis. Choline oxidation takes place primarily in the liver and kidney with enzymes found in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. The complete oxidation of choline results in four of its five carbons entering the one-carbon pool. In the cytosol, one carbon directly becomes the labile methyl carbon of Met via the BHMT-catalyzed reaction. In the mitochondrion, three other one carbon units enter the folate pool at the oxidation state of formaldehyde by reactions catalyzed by dimethylglycine dehydrogenase, sarcosine dehydrogenase, and the glycine cleavage system, respectively. It has been established that folate metabolism in the mitochondrion functions in part to produce formate, which leaves this organelle to become activated into the folate one-carbon pool of the cytoplasm (23Garcia-Martinez L.F. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4671-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Pasternack L.B. Laude Jr., D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm these one carbon units are used for purine and thymidylate biosynthesis and the folate- and vitamin B12-dependent methylation of Hcy. Because choline is abundant in the diet of humans, primarily as phosphatidylcholine, its oxidation may contribute substantially to the total one carbon needs of the liver and kidney.The regulation of hepatic choline oxidation is not completely understood. Free choline resides at a metabolic branch point; it can be incorporated into phospholipids, converted to acetylcholine, or oxidized to glycine. Quantitatively, the use of choline for acetylcholine synthesis is negligible. The competition for choline to be incorporated into phospholipids or proceed through the oxidation pathway is between cytosolic choline kinase and transport into the mitochondrion; the latter is reportedly the rate-limiting step in the irreversible oxidation of choline to betaine (25Kaplan C.P. Porter R.K. Brand M.D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 24-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). TheK m of rat liver choline kinase for choline is about 0.03 mm (26Uchida T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10156-10162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that for choline transport into rat liver mitochondrion has been estimated to be about 0.22 mm (27Porter R.K. Scott J.M. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14637-14646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Choline concentrations in rat liver range from 0.05 to 0.25 mm (28Haubrich D.R. Wang P.F.L. Chippendale T. Proctor E. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. Harris B.J. Kyle W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 218: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and presumably, higher levels are attained when dietary choline is supplemented in the diet. Taken together, these data suggest that free choline in liver is preferentially incorporated into phospholipids and that choline oxidation functions as a spillover pathway that is sensitive to dietary choline intake and subsequent tissue levels. In fact, metabolic tracer studies using rat liver slices have estimated that about 90% of the free choline proceeds through the oxidation pathway (30Weinhold P.A. Sanders R. Life Sci. 1973; 13: 621-629Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We are interested in BHMT because it resides at an interface between choline oxidation and sulfur amino acid and one-carbon metabolism, and it is possible that these pathways are coordinately regulated in part by the BHMT-catalyzed reaction. We have chosen to focus our initial efforts on the influence nutrition has on BHMT gene expression because previous work indicated that activity levels of hepatic BHMT are affected by diet.There have been numerous studies investigating the effects of nutrition on hepatic BHMT activity (13Park E.I. Renduchintala M.S. Garrow T.A. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1997; 8: 541-545Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Emmert J.L. Garrow T.A. Baker D.H. J.

The earliest studies used rats and showed that the specific activity of BHMT varies with the dietary intake of sulfur amino acids, choline, and betaine (31Finkelstein J.D. Harris B.J. Martin J.J. Kyle W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. Harris B.J. Kyle W.E.

The greatest changes were observed with Met deficiency and Met deficiency in combination with excess dietary choline where up to 3-fold increases of BHMT activity were observed. We subsequently observed similar responses of BHMT activity in chicken liver when chicks were fed varying levels of sulfur amino acids, choline, and betaine (19Emmert J.L. Garrow T.A. Baker D.H. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2050-2058PubMed Google Scholar). Although supplemental levels of Met, either with or without excess methyl donor, slightly stimulated chick liver BHMT activity, as was observed in rats (31Finkelstein J.D. Harris B.J. Martin J.J. Kyle W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we confirmed that BHMT activity is most dramatically up-regulated when the diet is deficient in Met. Furthermore, the magnitude of induction was greater in our chicken study than that previously reported for rats, reaching 6-fold induction levels. A more recent study from our laboratory showed that 8–10-fold increases in BHMT activity can be achieved by feeding rats amino acid-defined diets deficient in Met containing excess betaine (13Park E.I. Renduchintala M.S. Garrow T.A. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1997; 8: 541-545Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, the diet-induced changes were shown to be mediated by changes in the steady-state levels of mRNA. Finally, we recently reported a preliminary investigation using pigs (34Emmert J.L. Webel D.M. Biehl R.R. Griffiths M.A. Garrow L.S. Garrow T.A. Baker D.H. J. Anim. Sci. 1998; 76: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the results suggest that in this species the liver enzyme is refractory to changes in diet, but the kidney enzyme is inducible under conditions of Met deficiency with supplemental choline or betaine, although to a much lower extent than what we observed with the chicken and rat liver enzymes. Taken together, the data are consistent across species and indicate that BHMT activity is influenced by Met, choline, and betaine intakes. In all of the previous studies, it was concluded that Met restriction induces BHMT activity. However, none of the studies to date have controlled for the dramatic changes in food intake that accompany the consumption of diets deficient in Met, and all of the studies in which a major induction was observed used choline-containing diets.The data we report here show that changes in BHMT activity are primarily due to the changes in the nutrient content of the diet rather than a physiological response to reduced food intake. These changes in activity are due to changes in mRNA content and immunodetectable protein. Furthermore, our data indicate that although high levels of BHMT induction require Met restriction, Met restriction alone is not sufficient; there must also be some methyl donor in the diet. As speculated in our previous report (19Emmert J.L. Garrow T.A. Baker D.H. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2050-2058PubMed Google Scholar), there is a dose-dependent relationship between the level of BHMT induction and the amount of methyl donor in a diet limiting in Met. We also show that the magnitude of induction is related to the severity of Met deficiency. Although the methyl donor-dependent induction of BHMT expression requires Met restriction, this induction occurs at a level of Met intake that is above the maintenance requirement for the weanling rat. Taken together, these data support the idea proposed by Finkelstein et al. (31Finkelstein J.D. Harris B.J. Martin J.J. Kyle W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that BHMT functions to conserve the backbone of Hcy under conditions of Met deficiency; however, BHMT primarily does so only when there is also a source of methyl donor in the diet, shown here to include choline, betaine, or sulfonium analogs of betaine.The requirement for both low dietary Met and adequate methyl donor levels for the high induction of BHMT expression may be a regulatory control to prevent the futile cycling of methyl groups. Because a diet devoid or low in choline necessitates the synthesis of this compound using S-adenosylmethionine, increasing BHMT expression when both dietary Met and choline are deficient might enhance the oxidation of choline, a compound being synthesized using methyl groups derived from scarce Met supplies. Synthesizing choline from methyl groups derived from Met only to in turn oxidize it would be a futile cycle. In contrast, the induction of BHMT when dietary Met levels are low and choline is adequate or high allows the liver to spare the labile methyl carbon of Met two ways. First, choline directly spares the methyl group of Met because the cell no longer needs to synthesize as much phosphatidylcholine, as it can activate choline by phosphorylation and incorporate it first into cytidine diphosphocholine and then into phosphatidylcholine. Second, by increasing the expression of BHMT under these nutritional conditions, the liver cell increases the probability of Hcy being remethylated to Met, rather than have Hcy proceed through the transsulfuration pathway.Further studies will be required to determine what mechanisms mediate the diet-induced changes in steady-state levels of hepatic BHMT mRNA. Earlier reports indicate that actinomycin D could partially block BHMT induction in rat liver (20Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Harris B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 146: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) or cultured cells (35Grzelakowska-Sztabert B. Balinska M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 632: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), provided varying levels of dietary or medium Met, respectively. It can be inferred from these earlier studies that the diet-induced increases we observed in BHMT mRNA are due in part to changes in transcription. The influence of diet or physiological state on BHMT mRNA turnover has not been studied. In order to begin studies on the transcriptional regulation of BHMT expression, we have cloned the 5′-flanking region of the human BHMT gene into a luciferase reporter vector and have confirmed that changes in medium sulfur amino acid and betaine concentrations cause significant changes in BHMT promoter activity in Hep G2 transfectants. 2A. P. Breksa and T. A. Garrow, unpublished observations. The molecular signals that initiate these putative changes in BHMT transcription remain to be identified.In addition to the 5′-flanking region of the human BHMT gene, we have isolated several overlapping clones encoding the human BHMT gene (Fig.4). The intron-exon junctions were mapped and sequenced, and the intron sizes were determined. The intronic sequences flanking each exon are reported and all intron-exon junctions follow the GT-AG rule. The major transcriptional start site in liver has been determined using 5′-RACE, and computer analysis of the 5′-flanking region has identified many putative transcription factor binding sites (Fig. 5). Centered 26 nucleotides upstream from the transcriptional start site is a TATA box. This TATA box was the only one identified as a putative promoter using TSSG and TSSW programs. The 5′-flanking region also contains a significant number of potential steroid transcription factor binding sites. Some of the glucocorticoid response elements are presumably functional because glucocorticoids have been shown to increase rat liver BHMT activity (20Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Harris B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 146: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and mRNA levels (21Garrow T.A. Park E.I. Garrow L.S. Griffiths M.A. Pfleiderer W. Rokos H. Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines and Folates. Blackwell Wissenschafts-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1997: 303-308Google Scholar). Several transcription factor binding sites known to be important in liver-specific expression were also identified, including HNF-1, HNF-3, and CAAT enhancer-binding protein.Although a genetic deficiency of BHMT activity has not been described, it is possible that mutations or polymorphisms in the gene exist that reduce BHMT activity and increase plasma Hcy levels and thus increase vascular disease risk. We are unaware of any attempts to identify individuals deficient in BHMT activity, most likely because the organs that express this enzyme, the liver and kidney, are not routinely biopsied and have not been specifically sampled for this purpose. The sequence of the human BHMT gene reported here will permit investigators to screen for gene variants using genomic DNA isolated from blood or any other easily isolated cell type. The availability of the 5′-flanking region of the gene will allow further studies on the nutrient-, hormone-, and tissue-specific regulation of BHMT gene transcription. Betaine-homocysteines S-methyltransferase (BHMT)1 (EC 2.1.1.5) catalyzes a methyl transfer from betaine to homocysteine (Hcy), forming dimethylglycine and Met, respectively. Betaine is an intermediate of choline oxidation, and the enzymes of this pathway are primarily found in the liver and kidney of mammals (1Sunden L.F.S. Renduchintala M.S. Park E.I. Miklasz S.D. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), although we have recently shown that BHMT is also expressed in the lenses of rhesus monkeys and humans (2Rao P.V. Garrow T.A. John F. Garland D. Millian N.S. Zigler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30669-30674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This enzyme has recently been shown to be zinc-dependent (3Millian N.S. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and based on protein purification reports, it has been estimated that BHMT represents 0.5–2% of the total soluble protein in mammalian liver (4Garrow T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22831-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although these studies presumably used livers from animals that were consuming diets containing adequate Met, it is possible that BHMT can represent an even greater proportion of liver protein, because as reported here, when choline-containing diets are deficient in Met, there occur dramatic increases in hepatic BHMT protein content. However, regardless of dietary conditions, it is clear that BHMT is a major zinc metalloenzyme in liver. Interest in the nutrient and genetic factors that influence Hcy metabolism has increased because elevated concentrations of this amino acid in blood have been correlated to the incidence of arteriosclerotic vascular disease and thrombosis. BHMT is one of two known mammalian enzymes that methylate Hcy, the other being the folate/vitamin B12-dependent Met synthase (EC 2.1.1.13). Of these two methyltransferases, it is known that genetic defects that reduce the flux through the Met synthase catalyzed reaction, or a deficient intake of either of its coenzyme vitamin precursors, result in elevated concentrations of blood Hcy (5Rosenblatt D.S.

Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 3029-3049Google Scholar). Whether BHMT is required for normal Hcy metabolism is not known, because choline, the metabolic precursor of betaine, is not an essential nutrient unless the level of Met in the diet is severely deficient. Under normal nutritional status, the choline moiety can be synthesized by theS-adenosylmethionine-dependent conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. A naturally occurring combined deficiency of Met and choline has not been described in humans and is not likely to occur because choline, primarily as phosphatidylcholine, is abundant in human diets. Furthermore, to date, there have been no inherited defects in the BHMT-catalyzed reaction described, and therefore, it has not been possible to ascertain whether such defects perturb Hcy metabolism in humans. Although the significance of BHMT in Hcy homeostasis is not clear, it is known that the relative contribution of BHMT to Hcy remethylation can be influenced by diet. For example, it has been shown that the rate of Hcy remethylation is increased when choline or betaine is added to the diet of humans (7Mudd S.H. Poole J.R.

Our studies of human CFTR transcription focus on identifying transcription factors bound to an inverted CCAAT consensus or “Y-box element.” The human homeodomain CCAAT displacement protein/cut homolog (CDP/cut) can bind to the Y-box element through a cut repeat and homeobox.

The expression of CFTRis confined primarily to specific epithelial cell types and is ordinarily expressed in low levels. The low levels and cell type-specific expression ofCFTR appear to be dictated primarily by sequences upstream of the transcriptional start sites of CFTR which correspond to functional promoter sequences (3Yoshimura K.

Despite the absence of a TATA signal, the human CFTR gene can initiate RNA transcription through multiple, discrete start sites requiring conserved residues within the Y-box. Thus, an intact CCAAT consensus on the opposing strand of the human CFTR appears to be a requirement for accurate transcript initiation (12Pittman N. Shue G. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28848-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both basal and cAMP-mediated regulation of CFTR transcription have implicated the Y-box (12Pittman N.

CFTR transcription appears to be influenced by additional cis-acting elements, including a site located in the first intron of the human CFTR (14Smith A. Barth M.L. McDowell T.L. Moulin D.S.

The activation of CFTR transcription by cAMP correlates with increasing sensitivity to DNase I overlapping the Y-box element (12Pittman N. Shue G. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol.

Although it has been shown previously that individual members of bZIP families of transcription factors have the capacity to bind and activate CFTRtranscription (12Pittman N. Shue G. LeLeiko N.S.

Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The level of acetylation of conserved residues on the core histones H3 and H4 appears to plays a critical role in the regulation of gene transcription (17Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 272: 371-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and the presence of histone acetyltransferase activity correlates with the activation of other genes (18Wade P.A. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 82-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Conversely, it is believed that gene repression is associated with the increased activity of histone deacetylases (17Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 272: 371-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar,20Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Although it is accepted that histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases are tightly associated with transcriptional machinery through several well characterized transcriptional cofactors or adaptor proteins (21Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 22Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar), little is known about how such activities are directed to a specific gene. Several genes encoding histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities have been identified in human. Interestingly, many of these genes encode both transcriptional coactivators and corepressors, such as hGCN5, P/CAF, p300/CBP, TAF250, and HDAC1/2 (for review see Ref. 18Wade P.A. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 82-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent observations have suggested that transcriptional cofactors such as p300/CBP and HDAC1/2 encode proteins for the enzymatic histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities, respectively (22Ogryzko V.V.

These proteins can form complexes with sequence-specific nuclear hormone receptors and transcription factors (25Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L.

Although these cofactors do not possess sequence-specific DNA binding activities, a transcriptional cofactor can target a specific gene when tethered to a gene promoter through a heterologous DNA binding domain as shown previously (29Wang H. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, transcriptional cofactors may regulate the level of histone acetylation of a specific gene through interactions with sequence-specific transcription factors.Our present objective was to identify proteins bound to the humanCFTR promoter through the Y-box nucleotide consensus of theCFTR. We have now identified two such proteins: CDP/cut, a homeodomain repressor, and the transcription factor complex CBF·NF-Y. CBF·NF-Y is a highly conserved complex of heterotrimeric subunits shown to interact with CCAAT sequence elements common to many eukaryotic promoters (30Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 31Maity S.N. Sinha S. Ruteshouser E.C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16574-16580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conserved residues within subunits of the CBF·NF-Y complex, which include a region homologous to the histone-fold motif found in histones H2A and H2B, are necessary for subunit interaction to form the heterotrimeric complex (32Sinha S. Kim I.-S. Sohn K.-Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Domains of CBF·NF-Y, located in two of the subunits (CBF-c and CBF-b) are necessary for the transactivation by the CBF·NF-Y complex (33Coustry F. Maity S.N. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14485-14491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The CBF·NF-Y-bound complex can form tight interactions with known histone acetyltransferases hGCN5 and P/CAF to transactivate transcription (27Currie R.A. J. Biol.

It was defined subsequently as a gene-specific transcriptional repressor associated with the differential regulation of the gp91phox gene in myeloid cell differentiation (41Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).The objective of this study was to determine further whether transcription of CFTR is regulated by nuclear factors associated with histone acetylation. Because the regulationCFTR transcription is potentiated through cAMP and the CREB/ATF activators (12Pittman N. Shue G. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28848-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Matthews R.P. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31869-31877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we postulate that mechanisms directing the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase coactivators could, conversely, direct a histone deacetylase complex through a separate set of CCAAT-binding factors within the context of the humanCFTR promoter Y-box element. In this report, we present evidence that the Y-box element of the CFTR promoter is a site that intersects histone acetylation and deacetylation processes with mechanisms to modulate transcription of CFTR.DISCUSSIONThe architecture of chromatin plays a fundamental role in the regulation of genes. The underlying behavior of gene transcriptionin vivo may be determined more by the overall structure of chromatin as a result of the cumulative function transcription factors have in regulating local chromatin structure. The relationship between the remodeling of chromatin by the modification of histones and gene-specific transcription factors recently has become more apparent (15Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 20Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Since the observation of transcriptional regulatory proteins encoding intrinsic activity for the acetylation or deacetylation of histones, this mechanism for altering chromatin structure has gained prominence in the study of gene regulation (19Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Although it is believed that acetylation of histones may neutralize charged lysine residues to allow for the movement or displacement of nucleosomes along a DNA template, making local chromatin more accessible and active for gene transcription, a precise mechanism for this model has yet to be elucidated.In this report, we provide evidence that the CFTR gene Y-box element is a potential target of the CBF·NF-Y activation complex. This was demonstrated by competitive EMSA and supershift analysis (Fig.1). CBF·NF-Y has been implicated previously in the assembly and remodeling of chromatin structure surrounding its cognate sequence (63Linhoff M.W. Wright K.L. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4589-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The trimeric subunit complex of CBF·NF-Y has been shown previously to possess histone acetyltransferase activity through the tethering of hGCN5 and/or P/CAF to CBF·NF-Y (27Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 28Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have also demonstrated the binding of the CFTR inverted CCAAT (Y-box) sequence by the transcription factor C/EBP (12Pittman N. Shue G. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28848-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although our study here has not included the role of C/EBP on CFTRtranscription, it is important to note that C/EBP can interact with CBP/p300 in vivo (64Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is the focus of other studies. We believe that C/EBP may play a particularly intriguing role inCFTR transcription. The absence of C/EBP in cell lines derived from transgenic “knockout” mice, when compared with wild-type littermates, show the lack of p300-containing complexes associated with the CFTR Y-box. However, this observation is in contrast to results showing CBP associated with the same Y-box element in both knockout and wild-type cell lines. 4M. J. Walsh, S.-D. Li, and G. Shue, manuscript in preparation. Interestingly, the rate of CFTR transcription in vivo in these same “knockout” cell lines is precisely half of that compared with the wild-type cell lines. It is plausible to consider that the composition of individual coactivator complexes could reflect a preferential stoichiometric arrangement or dosage between CBP and p300 (65Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.-E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingstone D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) and may demonstrate some distinction and/or differential regulation between the two coactivators.We have demonstrated that transcription of CFTR is mediated by the transcription factor ATF-1 and the human histone acetyltransferase hGCN5 (Fig. 2). Transfection studies have demonstrated the activating potential of the transcription factor ATF-1 and the human histone acetyltransferase hGCN5 to stimulateCFTR transcription. Evidence that hGCN5 potentiates transcription of CFTR indicates a role for histone acetylation in the regulation of CFTR transcription. We also show that CDP/cut has a functional role in repressing transcription of CFTR. This result suggested to us that CDP/cut effectively competes with transcriptional activators hGCN5 and ATF-1 to antagonize directly the activation ofCFTR transcription (Figs. 3 and 4). The binding of CDP/cut (shown in Fig. 5, A and B) overlaps the Y-box of CFTR; therefore, we speculate that transcription factors bound to the Y-box may, differentially, alter the pattern of histone acetylation in chromatin proximal to transcript initiation to regulate transcription. In our studies, we have used the CDP/cut protein, from nuclear extracts, transfected COS-7 cells, and from protein expressed in bacteria to show binding to theCFTR Y-box (Fig. 5 B). How does the Y-box element function to regulate CFTR transcription in vivo? Our studies demonstrate that inhibition of histone deacetylase activity with TSA corresponds to the stimulation of CFTRtranscription mediated through an inverted and intact CCAAT sequence. Evidence in this report implies that activities competing for the association with the Y-box element regulate the level of histone acetylation in chromatin surrounding the transcript start sites, leading to either activation or repression of gene transcription. We have shown that inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by TSA potentiates the transcription of a CFTR-directed transgene through the Y-box element. Thus, the activation of CFTRtranscription could be linked to histone acetyltransferase activity through the inverted CCAAT nucleotide consensus (Y-box) sequence. Examination of the CFTR promoter in vivo using aBspMI endonuclease sensitivity assay suggests that TSA will promote cleavage of nucleotide sequences proximal to theCFTR Y-box element and CRE (Fig. 7). Furthermore, DNase I hypersensitivity assays shown in Fig. 8 demonstrate that an intact 5′-ATTGG-3′ sequence of human CFTR is required for DNase I hypersensitivity of nuclei. DNase I hypersensitivity of twoCFTR-directed transgenic constructs reveals that, in fact, the ATTGG consensus is an essential nucleotide requirement for the nuclease hypersensitivity of the CFTR promoter in chromatin as a result of the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity in vivo. This has been demonstrated in several randomly selected stably transfected clones (data not shown). Despite the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by TSA to stimulate CFTRtranscription through the putative alteration of chromatin structure, overlapping the Y-box element, there is no direct evidence to show the modification of histones within the context of the CFTRpromoter to undergo changes in acetylation patterns as a result of TSA treatment. However, our observations suggest that the specialized sensitivity of local chromatin to nuclease hydrolysis is linked to the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity. We have yet to establish whether trans-acting factors bound to the CFTRY-box element (such as CDP/cut, C/EBP, or CBF·NF-Y) can target the enzymatic modification of local histones in vivo(66Kadosh D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Although the correlation between histone acetylation and gene activation is established, further studies to determine the extent of local chromatin to undergo histone modification will have to be performed.Our observations suggest the association of CDP/cut with histone deacetylase activity. We propose that transcriptional repression by CDP/cut may recruit histone deacetylases toCFTR and that certain factors tethered to the DNA-binding proteins (such as CDP/cut) can target the deacetylation (or acetylation) of specific lysine residues of core histones such as those established through similar models (67Yang W.M.

Cell. 1993; 72: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Because CFTRtranscription is potentiated through TSA we tested whether CDP/cut may function to interact with any known histone deacetylase. Immunoprecipitation of CDP/cut demonstrates that along with CDP/cut, histone deacetylase activity is coimmunoprecipitated and is inhibited by TSA. Furthermore, studies using fusion proteins of CDP/cut indicate that CDP/cut may recruit interactions with histone deacetylase, HDAC1, through the COOH-terminal domain known to contain the repression domain of CDP/cut (57Mailly F. Bérubé G. Harada R. Mao P.-L. Phillips S. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5346-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is only implied here that CDP/cut may repress gene transcription of CFTRthrough a mechanism incorporating the histone deacetylation of chromatin in proximity to the CFTR promoter. Although the molecular basis for the repression mediated by CDP/cut in vivo is not known, it could conceptually involve competition between enzymes involved in histone acetylation associated with sequence-specific transcription factors. Although this simple model could explain the role CDP/cut may have in transcriptional repression of CFTR, still little is known about the precise mechanism directing specific alterations in local chromatin domainsin vivo.The acetylation state of local chromatin may represent a stoichiometric relationship between competing acetylation and deacetylation processes. Thus, the requirement for the Y-box in hGCN5-mediated transactivation of CFTR suggests that the Y-box element likely binds proteins necessary for the conformational changes in chromatin structure. There is evidence to suggest that certain transcription factors have higher affinity for their binding sites when the nucleotide sequences are embedded in chromatin assembled from hyperacetylated histones (69Vettese-Dadey M. Grant P.A. Hebbes T.R. Crane-Robinson C. Allis C.D. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2508-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It is plausible that competing activities directed by CDP/cut or CBF·NF-Y, as an example, recruit activities favorable for either the repression or activation ofCFTR transcription, respectively. Although we suggest that CDP/cut recruits histone deacetylase activity, it is unclear precisely how such a ternary complex of CDP/cut is assembled in the context of the CFTR promoter Y-box element and whether such events do take place in v"

The phosphorylated p54cdc25-c in turn activates the p34-cyclin B protein kinase and triggers mitosis. Although the active p34-cyclin B protein kinase can itself phosphorylate and activate p54cdc25-c, we have investigated the possibility that other kinases may initially trigger the phosphorylation and activation of p54cdc25-c. We have examined the effects of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase II) on p54cdc25-c. Our in vitro experiments show that CaM kinase II can phosphorylate p54cdc25-c and increase its phosphatase activity by 2.5–3-fold. Treatment of a synchronous population of HeLa cells with KN-93 (a water-soluble inhibitor of CaM kinase II) or the microinjection of AC3-I (a specific peptide inhibitor of CaM kinase II) results in a cell cycle block in G2phase. In the KN-93-arrested cells, p54cdc25-c is not phosphorylated, p34cdc2 remains tyrosine phosphorylated, and there is no increase in histone H1 kinase activity.

A number of studies have shown that this requirement for calcium during cell division is mediated by calmodulin (CaM),1 an intracellular calcium-binding protein (6Means A.R. VanBerkum M.F.A.

Studies in several species have shown that the level of calmodulin protein rises 2-fold as cells progress through the G1/S phase checkpoint (8Chafouleas J.G. Bolton W.E. Hidaka H. Boyd A.E.

The results of several studies also suggest that calcium/CaM may also be involved in the G2/M phase transition in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Lu K.P. Means A.R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 40-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Transient increases in intracellular calcium can be detected as cells undergo nuclear envelope breakdown and chromatin condensation (11Keith C.H. Ratan R. Maxfield F.R. Bajer A. Shelanski M.L.

The level of the calmodulin protein is also reported to increase 2-fold when mammalian tsBN2 cells are induced to undergo premature chromatin condensation upon incubation at the restrictive temperature (16Nishimoto T. Ajiro K. Hirata M. Yamashita K. Sekiguchi M. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 156: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, the reduction of intracellular calmodulin levels using calmodulin antisense RNA (17Rasmussen C.D. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) or the use of calmodulin antagonists (9Sasaki Y. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) is reported to block entry of the cells into mitosis and imply a role for CaM at the G2/M phase checkpoint. However, the immediate targets of calcium/CaM at the G2/M phase checkpoint remain largely unknown. Studies in sea urchin eggs andXenopus oocytes suggest the target to be a multifunctional calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (CaM kinase II). CaM kinase II is a member of a family of multifunctional calcium/CaM-dependent protein kinases, which include CaM kinases Ia, Ib, and IV and which have broad substrate specificity and wide distribution in mammalian tissue (Ref. 18Pausch M.H.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the sea urchin CaM kinase II using either anti-CaM kinase antibodies or an inhibitory peptide was found to block nuclear envelope breakdown (24Baitinger C. Alderton J. Poenie M. Schulman H. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, it is reported that microinjection of a cDNA encoding a calcium/CaM-independent form of CaM kinase II induced maturation inXenopus oocytes (25Waldmann R. Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These observations together with the finding that mammalian cells contain nuclear isoforms of CaM kinase II (26Srinivasan M. Edman C. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and that the enzyme is localized in the nucleus during interphase and in the mitotic apparatus of dividing cells (27Ohta Y. Ohba T. Miyamoto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5341-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) suggest that CaM kinase II may be a positive regulator of the G2/M phase transition. The targets of the Ca2+/CaM/CaM kinase II second messenger system must ultimately be the cell cycle control proteins. Of these, the p34cdc2 protein kinase is generally acknowledged to be the key mediator of the G2/M phase transition in all eucaryotic cells (reviewed in Refs. 28Nurse P.

The active mitotic kinase (MPF, or mitosis-promotingfactor) is a dimer comprising a catalytic subunit, p34cdc2, and a regulatory subunit, a B-type cyclin (30Labbe J.C. Capony J.-P. Caput D.

Cyclins are a class of proteins that are synthesized during the interphase of each cell cycle and rapidly degraded at the end of each mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 33Hunt T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 274-286Google Scholar). The activity of the p34cdc2protein kinase depends not only on its association with cyclin B but also on its phosphorylation state. Three major sites of phosphorylation have been identified, corresponding to Thr14, Tyr15, and Thr161 in the human p34cdc2protein (34Gould K.H. Moreno S. Owen D.J. Sazer S. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3297-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 35Solomon M.J. Lee T. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of either Thr14 or Tyr15 inhibits p34cdc2 kinase activity (36Gould K.H. Nurse P. Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 37Norbury C. Blow J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), while phosphorylation of the Thr161 residue is required for kinase activity (38Poon R.Y.C. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P.

There is now considerable evidence suggesting that the dephosphorylation (of Tyr15 and Thr14) and activation of p34cdc2 at the G2/M phase checkpoint is initiated by a tyrosine phosphatase, the product of the fission yeast cdc25 gene or its homologues in other eucaryotes (41Millar J.B.A. McGowan C.H.

In the species studied so far, the enzymatic activity of cdc25 has been found to be regulated during the cell cycle by transcriptional control (46Edgar B.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1989; 57: 177-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), by translational control (47Moreno S. Nurse P. Russell P. Nature. 1990; 344: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), or by a post-translational modification involving phosphorylation of the Cdc25 protein (48Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Jessus Marcote M. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 49Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G.

In mammalian cells, the Cdc25-C protein is known to be phosphorylated at mitosis, and it has been shown that the p34cdc2-cyclin B protein kinase phosphorylates and activates the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the Cdc25-C protein (48Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Jessus Marcote M. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism assumes the presence of some active p34cdc2-cyclin B protein kinase, the origin of which remains unknown. Protein kinases other than p34cdc2-cyclin B, such as Cdk2-cyclin A and Cdk2-cyclin E, can also phosphorylate and activate the Xenopus Cdc25 protein in vitro (51Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, in Xenopus extracts depleted of both Cdc2 and Cdk2, Cdc25 still undergoes phosphorylation and activation upon the addition of the protein phosphatase inhibitor microcystin (51Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, an alternative explanation is that another protein kinase(s) phosphorylates and activates the enzymatic activity of Cdc25-C. Once the production of active p34cdc2-cyclin B is initiated, a positive feedback loop producing more active kinase would ensue, as Hoffmann and co-workers suggest (48Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Jessus Marcote M. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that Cdc25-C is phosphorylated during M phase in mammalian cells and that this phosphorylation can be inhibited by KN-93, a water-soluble, cell-permeable inhibitor of CaM kinase II. Treatment of HeLa cells with either KN-93 or AC3-I, a specific peptide inhibitor of CaM kinase II, inhibits progression of the cells through the G2/M phase checkpoint. We also show that in vitro the Cdc25-C protein is a substrate for CaM kinase II and that the phosphorylated enzyme has a 2.5–3-fold greater tyrosine phosphatase activity when compared with the nonphosphorylated enzyme. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (MEM) (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies) and antibiotics/antimycotic (penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B; Life Technologies). HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S phase boundary using the thymidine-aphidicolin double block method (52Heintz N. Sive H.L. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Mitotic and G2 phase cells were obtained following 14–18 h of treatment with nocodazole (50 ng/ml; Sigma) as described previously (48Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Jessus Marcote M. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). HeLa cells blocked at the G1/S phase boundary and S phase cells (3 h after release from the G1/S phase block; Ref. 53Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) were obtained by scraping the cells from the plates with cold (4 °C) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.4 mmEDTA. The cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was lysed in 3 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and 10 μg/ml 1-chloro-3- tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone). For immunoprecipitation of either the Cdc25-C or the p34cdc2protein, 200–300 μg of total protein from HeLa cell lysates was used. The lysates were precleared by incubating with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The lysates were then incubated overnight (15 h) with either a polyclonal antibody to the human Cdc25-C protein (1:400 dilution) or a polyclonal anti-human Cdc2 antibody (1:200 dilution), at 4 °C. The antibody was recovered by incubating the lysates with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C, and the immunoprecipitates were washed five times in wash buffer (lysis buffer plus 0.05% SDS, 1 mm EGTA, and 100 nm okadaic acid). The washed immunoprecipitates were dissolved in 60 μl of sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE. Cdc25-C immunoprecipitates were not boiled before loading on an SDS gel in order to maintain aggregation of the antibody chains (48Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Jessus Marcote M. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Western blotting of proteins was performed as described previously (54Edgecombe M. Patel R. Whitaker M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3769-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the Cdc25-C antibody was used at a dilution of 1:200 (1:1000 for the Cdc2 antibody) and detected using 1 μCi of [125I]protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were subsequently exposed for autoradiography using Hyperfilm-M (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or phosphor image analysis (Raytek Scientific Ltd., Sheffield, UK). For detection of the Cdc25-C antibody, using an alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma), the protocols described in Ref. 55Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.61-18.74Google Scholar were used. The tyrosine phosphorylation state of the immunoprecipitated p34cdc2 was determined by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The proteins bound to the protein A-Sepharose beads were resolved using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. A mouse monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (PY54; Affinity, Nottingham, UK) was used (1:1000 dilution) for the Western blots as described previously (54Edgecombe M. Patel R. Whitaker M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3769-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The level of p34cdc2 in the immunoprecipitates was determined by Western blotting with the p34cdc2 antibody (1:1000 dilution). Cdc25-C protein was purified from the inclusion bodies of a strain of E. coli expressing the full-length protein (56Sadhu K. Reed S.I. Richardson H. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5139-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, after isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of cold (4 °C) TEN (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.3 m NaCl), and the bacteria was lysed by the addition of 10 ml of lysozyme (5 mg/ml) and incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. 1 ml of 10% Nonidet P-40 was then added, and the incubation continued for another 10 min. The lysate was diluted with 75 ml of 1.5m NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2 and incubated with DNase I (0.2 mg/ml) for 60 min at 4 °C. The lysate was then sonicated for 30 s at 4 °C and centrifuged at 12,500 ×g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of cold (4 °C) TEN, mixed with 1 ml of lysozyme (10 mg/ml), and incubated on ice for 10 min. 1 ml of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to the lysate before centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet, containing mostly inclusion bodies, was resuspended in 10 ml of 6m urea, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8. The suspension was boiled for 5 min at 100 °C, cooled to 37 °C, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g. The supernatant was recovered, warmed to 37 °C, and diluted into 100 ml of warm (37 °C) 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 5 mm glutathione (reduced), 0.5 mm glutathione (oxidized), 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was recovered and dialyzed against 3 × 500 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol. The 82-kDa Cdc25-C fusion protein was recovered from Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose chromatography, as described in Ref.48Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Jessus Marcote M. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar. Phosphorylation of Cdc25-C by CaM kinase II was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm Pipes, pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm EGTA, 200 μm CaCl2, 0.3 μg of calmodulin, 100 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 2.5 μg of Cdc25-C, and 50–200 ng of CaM kinase II. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min before termination of the reaction by the addition of 20 μl of 2× sample buffer. Phosphorylation of Cdc25-C by the purified p34cdc2 protein kinase was performed in a final volume of 25 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 6 mm EGTA, 10 μm ATP, 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP, 2.5 μg of Cdc25-C, and 1 μl of Cdc2 kinase. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min before being terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 2× sample buffer. Phosphorylation of Cdc25-C by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C was performed as described previously (57Moss S.J. Doherty C.A. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphatase activity of Cdc25-C or Cdc25-C following phosphorylation by CaM kinase II was assessed using a p34cdc2-cyclin B complex isolated from sea urchin embryos (40 min after fertilization) using p13suc1-Sepharose beads as described previously (54Edgecombe M. Patel R. Whitaker M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3769-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The p13 precipitates were washed three times with assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol) before the addition of Cdc25-C. The tubes were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, washed three times with buffer C, and assayed for H1 kinase activity as described (58Meijer L. Arion D. Golsteyn R. Pines J. Brizuela L. Hunt T. Beach D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). H1 kinase activity was quantitated by excising the histone H1 bands from the dried gels, dissolving in NCS tissue solubilizer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and scintillation counting, or by phosphor image analysis. Alternatively, the p13 beads were washed three times in wash buffer, resuspended in 2 volumes of 2× sample buffer, and used for Western blotting to determine the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p34cdc2. The H1 kinase activity of the p34cdc2 immunoprecipitates from HeLa cells was assayed as described by Gu et al. (53Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The phosphopeptide and phosphoamino acid analysis of Cdc25-C following phosphorylation by CaM kinase II was performed as described previously (57Moss S.J. Doherty C.A. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KN-93 was dissolved as a 10 mm stock in sterile distilled water (KN-92 was dissolved in Me2SO, 10 mm stock solution) and stored at −20 °C. KN-93 (10 μm) and KN-92 (10 μm) were added to HeLa cells (approximately 50% confluent cultures) 3 h after release from the aphidicolin-thymidine block. Samples were collected at 2–3-h intervals over an 18–22-h period. After washing the cells in cold (4 °C) PBS containing 0.4 mm EDTA, the cells were either lysed in lysis buffer or fixed in 1 ml of cold (−20 °C) methanol (70%). The fixed cells were washed two times in PBS and incubated in the dark for 60 min with PBS containing propidium iodide (Sigma) and RNase I (type 1-AS; Sigma). Analysis of the DNA content was performed using an EPICS Elite cell sorter (Coulter Electronics, Luton, UK). Okadaic acid (potassium salt; Affinity) was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 2 mm. Okadaic acid (0.5 μm) was added to HeLa cells 3 h after release from an aphidicolin-thymidine block. The cells were scraped from the plates and washed in cold (4 °C) PBS containing 0.4 mm EDTA and 0.5 μm okadaic acid. The cell pellet was lysed in 3 volumes of lysis buffer. HeLa cells were cultured on sterile 22 × 22-mm coverslips etched with a cross (to aid relocation of microinjected cells). The cells were blocked and released from G1/S phase as described above. The peptide was microinjected into the cells between 4 and 6 h after release from the G1/S phase arrest. The cells were injected around the cross essentially as described by Graessman et al. (59Graessman A. Graessman M. Mueller C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The AC3-I peptide was dissolved in 0.5× PBS (pH 7.2) and was used at a needle concentration of 10 μm. To facilitate identification of the microinjected cells, a fluorescent dye, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-dextran (0.5 mg/ml,M r 3000; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was incorporated into the peptide solution. The control peptide, AC3-C, was prepared similarly and used at a needle concentration of 10 mm. Approximately 50–100 cells were injected in five separate experiments with approximately 0.1–1.0 picoliters of peptide (1–10% of cell volume as estimated in Ref. 60Kreis T.E. Birchmeier W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1982; 75: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both peptides were microinjected into the cytoplasm. Using this technique, 85–90% of the microinjected cells remained viable as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. After microinjection the cells around the etched cross were photographed on a Nikon TMS light microscope (× 10 objective) using a Nikon F-801s camera. Cells were then returned to a 37 °C incubator for 24 h. After 24 h, the cells were again photographed around the etched cross and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (in PBS). Coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol, 10% PBS, and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-dextran-positive cells were counted under a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. The protease inhibitors aphidicolin and thymidine were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK). All other chemicals were of “Analar” grade and were purchased from BDH unless indicated otherwise. The recombinant human Cdc25-C protein was purified from bacterial inclusion bodies and renatured. As shown in Fig.1 A (left lane) a major 54-kDa band could be detected on a Coomassie-stained gel. The 54-kDa protein, when Western blotted, immunoreacted with a polyclonal antibody to the human Cdc25-C protein (see Fig. 1 A, right lane). To determine the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the renatured, purified Cdc25-C protein, we incubated it with the sea urchin p34cdc2-cyclin B complex (isolated from embryos 40 min postfertilization) bound to p13suc1-Sepharose beads. We have shown previously that at 40 min postfertilization the sea urchin p34cdc2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine and that cyclin B is present in the complex (54Edgecombe M. Patel R. Whitaker M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3769-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 61Twigg J. Patel R. Whitaker M.J. Nature. 1988; 332: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, B andC, Cdc25-C (0.01–1.25 mg/ml) caused a dose-dependent dephosphorylation of p34cdc2 on tyrosine, confirming the results of an earlier study (44Strausfeld U. Labbe J.-C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Picard A. Sadhu K. Russell P. Doree M. Nature. 1991; 351: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). To determine if Cdc25-C was a substrate for CaM kinase II in vitro, we treated the purified Cdc25-C protein (1 μg) with varying concentrations of purified, rat brain CaM kinase II (25–200 ng). The samples were subsequently resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto a nylon membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. Our results (shown in Fig. 2 A,top) indicate that a 54-kDa protein (Cdc25-C) was strongly phosphorylated by CaM kinase II in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent manner to a high stoichiometry (1.2 mol of phosphate/mol of Cdc25-C). In the absence of Cdc25-C, only weak phosphorylation was observed, which we presume represents the known autophosphorylation of the α- (51 kDa) and β- (66 kDa) subunits of CaM kinase II (19Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The nylon membrane from the preceding experiment was then immunoprobed with an anti-cdc25-C antibody and visualized using a colorimetric detection assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” The result of the Western blot (shown in Fig. 2 A, bottom) indicates that the mobility of the Cdc25-C protein in the SDS gel was retarded following phosphorylation by CaM kinase II. A slight upshift of Cdc25-C was seen (see Fig. 2 A, bottom, lane 3) following phosphorylation by 100 ng of CaM kinase II. The upshift was readily apparent (see Fig. 2 A,bottom, lane 4) when 200 ng o"

In humans over 50 distinct channels have been identified in both excitable and non-excitable cell types. These channels are involved in the control of a variety of cellular functions, including neuronal firing, neurotransmitter and hormone secretion, and cellular proliferation. All of these channels contain a pore-forming (P)1 domain with a sequence motif common to all K+ channels, the tripeptide sequence G(Y/F)G, found in this domain. The residues immediately adjacent to either side of this motif are also well conserved. It is believed that four of these P domains contribute to the formation of a functional K+-conductive pore (1MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 2Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1441-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 3Doyle D.A.

Analysis of the K+ channels in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome suggests eight distinct families of K+channels (4Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These channels contain 2, 4, or 6 transmembrane domains and 1 or 2 P domains, with both termini oriented toward the cytoplasm. The presence of other features in the primary sequence differentiates the families into distinctive functional subtypes. For example, among the six transmembrane domain channels, members of the Kvchannel family have a charged S4 transmembrane domain characteristic of voltage-gated channels. K+ channels with only two transmembrane domains surrounding a single P domain are all inward rectifiers (Kir). Mammalian homologues of each of these classes have been identified. The most recently discovered class of potassium channels is the tandem pore domain potassium (Kt) channel family. Kt channels have four putative transmembrane domains and two P domains. The P domains are separated by the second and third transmembrane domains. Although all these Kt channels have a conserved core region between M1 and M4, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains are quite diverse. Kt channels represent the most abundant class of K+ channels in C. elegans, with at least 39 distinct members (5Salkoff L. Butler A. Nonet M. Wei A. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: R79-R81Google Scholar). Four mammalian Kt channels have been cloned to date. All the mammalian channels in this family exhibit nearly instantaneous, non-inactivating K+ currents. The first mammalian Kt channel discovered was the weak inward rectifier TWIK-1 (6Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although TWIK-1 is sensitive to some classical K+ channel blockers (e.g. Ba2+), it is relatively insensitive to others (e.g. tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine). TWIK-1 activity is indirectly inhibited by acidification and stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA. The second pore domain, P2, has an atypical sequence, GLG, often seen in the P2 domains of Kt channels in C. elegans. Northern blot analysis shows that TWIK-1 mRNA is widely expressed. We report here the discovery of a new Kt channel cloned from human brain. We have named this channel TWIK-2 on the basis of three criteria. First, TWIK-2 shares significant sequence homology to TWIK-1, especially in the P domains. Second, the tissue distribution of TWIK-2 is similar to that of TWIK-1. Finally, the TWIK-2 channel is a weak inward rectifier whose electrophysiologic properties are similar to those of TWIK-1. The basic local alignment search tool (7Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) was used to identify human expressed sequence tag entries similar to the mammalian Kt channels TWIK-1, TREK-1, and TASK. The translation product of one of the returned ESTs,AA604914, is most closely related to human TWIK-1 (E = 3 × 10−5) and human TASK (E = 2 × 10−5) by BLAST-X analysis. No overlapping EST clones were found by BLAST-N analysis. The sequence reported for AA604914 was used to isolate cDNA clones using a modified solution capture method (8Shepard A.R. Rae J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3183-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, three oligonucleotides were designed, with two unmodified oligonucleotides flanking a third, biotinylated 30-mer oligonucleotide (Keystone, Camarillo, CA). These oligonucleotides were incubated with a NaOH-denatured human brain SuperScript cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.). The solution was neutralized and the hybridization proceeded overnight at 40° C. The annealed plasmid-biotinylated oligonucleotide complexes were isolated with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Lake Success, NY). The plasmids were eluted from the beads and were used to transform bacteria. The resultant bacterial colonies were transferred onto Hybond-N filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and probed with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide derived fromAA604914. After extensive washing in 2× SSPE, 0.5% SDS, the filters were exposed to BioMax film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Individual bacterial clones were picked from the original dish, and the plasmid was recovered from overnight minicultures. Bidirectional sequencing demonstrated an ORF that contained the nucleotide sequence found in ESTAA604914. Sequence analysis and alignments were performed with the LaserGene suite (DNAStar, Madison, WI), National Center for Biotechnology Information resources 2Available at the following on-line address:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. and the Prosite internet resource. 3Internet resource found on the ExPASy server atexpasy.hcuge.ch. The TWIK-2 cDNA was subcloned into a Xenopus oocyte expression plasmid, pOX, a generous gift from Dr. Tim Jegla (Stanford University). This vector contains the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the Xenopus β-globin gene flanking the insert (9Jegla T. Salkoff L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 32-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 510-base pair fragment was amplified from the TWIK-2 sequence by the polymerase chain reaction and was used to probe a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA fragment was labeled with α-[32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the Rediprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized to the Northern blot membrane with the high efficiency hybridization system (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) under conditions specified by the manufacturer. The washed blot was exposed to film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transcripts were synthesized from linearized cDNA templates with T3 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine; Ambion, Austin, TX). Defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 1–15 ng of cRNA. Standard methods for oocyte preparation and maintenance were used (10Leonoudakis D. Gray A.T. Winegar B.D. Kindler C.H. Harada M. Taylor D.M. Chavez R.A. Forsayeth J.R. Yost C.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 868-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One to four days after injection, two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed at room temperature. Voltage pulse protocols were applied from a holding potential of −80 mV with 1-s voltage pulse steps ranging from −140 to +40 mV in 20 mV increments, with 1.5-s interpulse intervals. Except where noted, all two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed with frog Ringer's solution (FR, composition in mm: 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.6), high potassium frog Ringer's solution (HK, composition in mm: 2.5 NaCl, 115 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.6) or ND96 (composition in mm: 96 NaCl, 2.0 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.6) as perfusate. Recordings were obtained in a 25-μl recording chamber at flow rates of 1–4 ml/min. Water-injected oocytes were used as controls, undergoing the same treatments as transcript-injected oocytes. Except where noted, at least three oocytes were assayed for each experimental condition reported. Signals were filtered with an 8-pole low-pass Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) set at a 20–100-Hz cut-off prior to sampling at 40–1000 Hz. To quantify responses, leakage currents of water-injected oocytes were averaged and subtracted from currents of cRNA-injected oocytes. Relative response is defined as current measured for the −80 to +40 mV pulse during the treatment condition compared with control. We analyzed eight positive clones from our solution hybridization screen. Six of the eight clones contained inserts of 2.5–2.7 kb. Two of these positives were sequenced. They contained an identical ORF of 939 base pairs encoding a 313-amino acid polypeptide with primary sequence features of a novel human Kt channel (Figs. 1 and2; GenBankTM accession numberAF117708). The gene encoded by this ORF was named TWIK-2 (see below). The predicted molecular mass of TWIK-2 is 33,751 daltons. Analysis of this clone reveals two upstream in-frame termination codons and an adequate translation initiation sequence. Two distinct P domains are located between pairs of transmembrane domains identified by hydropathy analysis (Kyte/Doolittle). This core region is preceded by a 3-amino acid amino-terminal domain and followed by a 57-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain. The arrangement of P and transmembrane domains, coupled with the lack of an amino-terminal signal sequence and a large domain between transmembrane domain M1 and the first P domain, suggests a transmembrane topology identical to that of other Ktchannels.Figure 2Amino acid sequence of TWIK-2. The P domains (underlined), potential glycosylation sites (*), and potential phosphorylation sites (boxed) described in the text are indicated. The putative transmembrane domains arehighlighted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Of the known mammalian Kt channels, TWIK-2 has structural features most similar to TWIK-1. In TWIK-1, a specific cysteine residue found in the M1-P1 loop (Cys-69) is implicated in the formation of homodimers by extracellular disulfide bond formation (11Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A similarly placed cysteine is found in TWIK-2 (Cys-53). TWIK-2 has twoN-glycosylation consensus sequences (Asn-79 and Asn-85; Fig.2), whereas TWIK-1 has a single glycosylation site in the M1-P1 loop. Two potential phosphorylation sites have been identified in TWIK-2 (Fig. 2). Like TWIK-1, TWIK-2 has a single casein kinase II recognition sequence (Ser-304) but lacks a Ca+2-calmodulin kinase phosphorylation site. TWIK-2 has a potential PKC phosphorylation site (Ser-158) that is located in the putative M2-M3 cytoplasmic loop. In TWIK-1 this PKC site is also found in the M2-M3 loop at residue Thr-161. We have named the new gene TWIK-2 because of its greatest overall sequence similarity with TWIK-1 compared with other Kt channels (53.8 versus 24–33%). In addition, 19 consecutive amino acids in its P2 domain are identical with amino acids within the P2 domain in TWIK-1. The P1 and P2 domains of TWIK-2 are more closely related to their counterparts in TWIK-1 (72 and 88% amino acid identity, respectively) than any other Kt channel (Fig.3, A and B). To determine the expression pattern of TWIK-2 in human tissues, a human multiple tissue Northern blot was hybridized with a cDNA probe derived from the TWIK-2 nucleotide sequence. A 2.6-kb species, similar in size to the full-length TWIK-2 cDNA described above, was present in a variety of tissues, primarily in placenta, heart, colon, and spleen (Fig.4). Lower levels of TWIK-2 mRNA could be detected in peripheral blood leukocytes, lung, liver, kidney, and thymus, with the lowest detectable levels found in brain. Two additional species, 6.8 and 1.35 kb, were also detected. The relative expression levels for these two species in these tissues closely paralleled the level of the 2.6-kb species. Significant TWIK-2 expression was also detected in pancreas (data not shown). TWIK-2 could not be detected in skeletal muscle by Northern blot analysis. Although the hierarchy of expression levels in these tissues is different for TWIK-1 and TWIK-2, TWIK-2 is expressed in the tissues in which TWIK-1 expression has been detected (6Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Electrophysiologic properties of heterologously expressed TWIK-2 channels were measured inXenopus oocytes. TWIK-2 currents activated instantaneously, did not inactivate, and deactivated within the resolution of two-electrode voltage clamp (Fig. 5,A and B). Weak inward rectification of TWIK-2 currents was observed (Fig. 5 C). However, unlike both human and mouse TWIK-1 (6Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 12Lesage F. Lauritzen I. Duprat F. Reyes R. Fink M. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), TWIK-2 currents did not saturate at depolarized potentials in either FR (Fig. 5, A andC) or ND96 (data not shown). The slope of the plot of reversal potential versus K+ concentration was 53 ± 3 mV per 10-fold change in K+ concentration (Fig. 5 C). Pharmacologic modulators of other cloned tandem pore domain potassium channels were examined, in addition to non-selective potassium channel inhibitors. To test the sensitivity of TWIK-2 currents to changes in extracellular pH, oocytes expressing TWIK-2 were incubated in FR whose pH was titrated with either HCl or NaOH. TWIK-2 currents were not sensitive to extracellular pH over the range of pH 5.6 to 8.4 (n = 4–6 oocytes at each extracellular pH, data not shown). However, pharmacologic treatments (1 mm 2,4-dinitrophenol or 100% carbon dioxide) known to lower intracellular pH (13Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. Honore E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 588-594PubMed Google Scholar) reduced TWIK-2 currents substantially (Fig.6 A). TWIK-2 currents were not inhibited by quinidine (100 μm,n = 5) or quinine (100 μm,n = 4, data not shown). TWIK-1 currents are inhibited with these treatments (6Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). TWIK-2 currents were also relatively insensitive to barium (Fig. 6 B). Zinc (100 μm) slightly inhibited TWIK-2 currents (−10 ± 1%, n= 3, p = 0.005 by paired t test). Currents observed in TWIK-2-injected oocytes were slightly larger after treatment with the PKC activator PMA (50–100 nm; 24 ± 3%; n = 5, p = 0.001 by pairedt test). Pharmacologic treatments known to activate protein kinase A (forskolin, 10 μm with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 mm, n = 4; or 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, 300 μm, n = 4) had no effect on TWIK-2 currents (data not shown). Unlike TREK-1 currents, TWIK-2 currents were not inhibited byN-methyl d-glucamine substitution for sodium in frog Ringer's solution (n = 5, data not shown). The following pharmacologic treatments had no or only minimal effect on TWIK-2 currents (data not shown): 4-aminopyridine (1 mm,n = 3), cesium chloride (1 mm,n = 3), ethanol (17 mm, n = 3), n-octanol (1 mm, n = 3), arachidonic acid (10 μm, n = 6), histamine (100 μm, n = 2), isoflurane (500 μm to 1 mm, n = 6), bupivacaine (10 μm, n = 3), tetraethylammonium (10 mm, n = 6), acetylcholine (1 μm, n = 6), secretin (1 nm, n = 4), apamin (1.0 μm,n = 4), glibenclamide (30 μm,n = 5), magnesium (5 mm, n= 5), and gadolinium (100 μm, n = 3). Changes in perfusate osmolality (200–400 mmol/kg) from addition of sucrose had minimal effect (<10%, n = 3) on TWIK-2 currents. We describe the cloning and functional expression of a new member of the mammalian Kt family of channels, TWIK-2. This new channel is the smallest of the Kt channels yet cloned but possesses structural features that define this family of potassium channels, i.e. two P domains, each bounded by a pair of transmembrane domains. For each of the P domains, TWIK-2 is most closely related to TWIK-1. The P2 domain in TWIK-2 is strikingly homologous to the P2 domain in TWIK-1 (Fig. 3 B). Only TWIK-1 and TWIK-2 have a GLG sequence motif in the second P domain; all of the other cloned mammalian Kt channels have a GFG sequence in this position. Besides the high primary sequence similarity of TWIK-2 to TWIK-1, we also found physiologic and pharmacologic similarities between the two channels. Both channels show weak inward rectification and have similar current-voltage relationships. Like TWIK-1 channels, TWIK-2 channels are inhibited by intracellular acidity. The only Kt channels inhibited by intracellular acidity are TWIK-1 (6Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and TOK1 (14Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4183-4187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), an outwardly rectifying Kt channel from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (14Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M.

Kaczmarek L.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Science. 1995; 376: 690-695Google Scholar). In contrast to TOK1 and TWIK-1, TWIK-2 is not sensitive to barium. Although our data suggest a role for modulation of TWIK-2 by PKC, the effect we observed in oocytes was small. Treatment of oocytes expressing TWIK-1 with the phorbol ester PMA has been shown to activate TWIK-1 channel activity, presumably by activating PKC (6Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The single PKC site in TWIK-1 is located within the M2-M3 loop, but mutation of this site (Thr-161) to an alanine residue did not alter the PMA sensitivity of TWIK-1. The PKC site in TWIK-2 is in the same loop. Therefore, like TWIK-1, the sensitivity of TWIK-2 to PMA may reflect an indirect effect of PKC on the channel. TWIK-2 is distinct from the other members of the Kt family. The second cloned mammalian Kt channel, TREK-1, is an outward rectifier Kt channel (16Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Expressed in many brain regions and the lung, as well as in kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle, this channel, unlike TWIK-2, is insensitive to acidification. TASK, the first mammalian K+ channel found to satisfy all the characteristics of a background channel, is a voltage-insensitive open rectifier whose activity is inhibited by extracellular acidification (10Leonoudakis D. Gray A.T. Winegar B.D. Kindler C.H. Harada M. Taylor D.M. Chavez R.A. Forsayeth J.R. Yost C.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 868-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Most recently, a fourth mammalian Kt channel, TRAAK, was reported (18Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This open rectifier also has characteristics of a background K+ conductance and is expressed only in the central nervous system, including the retina and spinal cord. Like TWIK-1, TWIK-2 has a widespread distribution. Of the tissues examined, TWIK-2 expression was absent from skeletal muscle only. TWIK-2 is abundantly expressed in pancreatic tissue, and heterologous TWIK-2 currents resemble physiologic base-line potassium channels that maintain the resting membrane potential of acinar cells (19Schmid A. Schulz I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 661-676Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Schmid A. Feick P. Schulz I. J. Physiol.

Pfluegers Arch. 1996; 432: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Like the physiologic base-line potassium channels expressed in pancreatic acinar cells, TWIK-2 is inhibited by intracellular acidity but is not sensitive to a number of potassium channel inhibitors, including tetraethylammonium, Ba2+, and 4-aminopyridine (20Schmid A. Feick P. Schulz I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 259-270Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, barium-insensitive potassium currents have been described in the kidney (22Tabei K. Muto S. Furuya H. Sakairi Y. Ando Y. Asano Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F490-F495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kibble J.D. Wareing M. Wilson R.W. Green R. Am. J.

Biochem. 1998; 8: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Weak inward rectifiers have also been reported in hepatocytes (25Takanashi H. Sawanobori T. Kamisaka K. Maezawa H. Hiraoka M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) as well as in eosinophils (26Tare M. Prestwich S.A. Gordienko D.V. Parveen S. Carver J.E. Robinson C. Bolton T.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 303-318Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). TWIK-2 is a weak inward rectifier whose zero current potential follows the reversal potential for K+. For some potassium channels, the primary sequence provides clues to potential mechanisms of inward rectification. Intracellular polyamines and magnesium control the degree of inward rectification of Kir channels by interacting with acidic residues within the second transmembrane domain (27Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Henley C.M. Brown A.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1068-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 28Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Although the degree of inward rectification of TWIK-1 is known to depend on intracellular magnesium levels, in general the mechanisms of rectification within the tandem pore domain family remain unknown. One area of future study is the formation of Kt channel dimers. TWIK-1 forms homodimers via a disulfide bridge between subunits involving identical extracellular cysteine residues (Cys-69) found in the M1-P1 linker region (11Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). TWIK-2 has a similarly placed cysteine residue, Cys-53. A TWIK-2 mutant in which Cys-53 has been mutated into an alanine residue did not show channel activity after heterologous expression in oocytes (data not shown). TWIK-2 may therefore form functional homodimeric channels via a disulfide bridge. Northern blot analysis of TWIK-2 expression demonstrates significant overlap with the pattern of TWIK-1 expression. It is therefore possible that TWIK-1/TWIK-2 heterodimers may form in those tissues, suggesting a mechanism for further functional diversity within the tandem pore domain K+ channel family.

In yeast, the Sec24p protein is the only COPII component in which two close orthologues have been identified. By using gene knock-out in yeast, we found that the absence of one of these Sec24 orthologues resulted in a selective secretion defect for a subset of proteins released into the medium. Data base searches revealed the existence of an entire family of Sec24-related proteins in humans, worms, flies, and plants. We identified and cloned two new human cDNAs encoding proteins homologous to yeast Sec24p, in addition to two human cDNAs already present within the data bases. The entire Sec24 family identified to date is characterized by clusters of highly conserved residues within the 2/3 carboxyl-terminal domain of all the proteins and a divergent amino terminus domain.

Each step of vesicle budding, targeting, and fusion implies that resident proteins from the donor compartment must be excluded from the forming vesicle, whereas cargo is selected and concentrated into it (1Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 2Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 3Schekman R. Barlowe C.

The isolation of several yeast mutants impaired in ER to Golgi transport led to the purification of a set of five cytosolic proteins sufficient to reconstitute the process of ER vesicle formation in vitro (4Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Cell. 1990; 61: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 5Schekman R. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). This COPII coat complex consists of Sar1p, Sec23-Sec24p, and Sec13-Sec31p complexes (7Pryer N.K. Wuestehube L.J. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 471-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 8Salama N.R. Yeung T. Schekman R.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Proteins of the secretory machinery appear to be well conserved throughout evolution, as a set of COPII proteins with significant homologies with the yeast proteins was identified in mammalian cells. Two mammalian homologues of yeast Sar1p were identified and found to localize to the transitional zone of the ER (9Kuge O. Dascher C. Orci L. Rowe T. Amherdt M. Plutner H. Ravazzola M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The human homologue of Sec13p was shown to participate in the exit of VSV-G protein from the ER (10Tang B. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We recently cloned and characterized two isoforms of human Sec23p, one of which complements a temperature-sensitivesec23-1 mutation (11Paccaud J. Reith W. Carpentier J. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Orci L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The in vitroreconstitution of mammalian ER vesicle formation was documented recently and found to be quite analogous to that in yeast (12Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). During vesicle formation, cargo proteins are concentrated into the budding vesicle, and ER resident proteins are selectively excluded (13Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar,14Mizuno M. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5732-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Two models can account for this process of cargo selection and concentration into the nascent vesicle. The first model proposes the existence of molecular sieves that allow only secretory molecules to selectively enter the vesicle. The yeast protein Shr3 could be such a sieve for a particular set of yeast proteins, the amino acid permeases (15Kuehn M.J. Schekman R. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The second model postulates that vesicle coat components interact with putative cargo receptors to sort and concentrate cargo molecules. By interacting either directly with determinants found on secretory membrane proteins or indirectly with putative “cargo receptors,” the COPII coat would thus participate in both cargo selection and bud formation (16Kuehn M.J. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The latter model recently received support from work carried out in yeast where it was shown that purified COPII components interact with vesicle integral membrane proteins and soluble cargo (17Kuehn M.J. Herrmann J.M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Moreover, in mammalian cells the transmembrane VSV-G protein was selectively recruited into the forming vesicle by the pre-budding complex composed of Sar1p and Sec23-24p complex, but no direct interaction between the cytosolic portion of VSV-G with the Sec23-24p complex could be demonstrated (12Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Potential cargo receptors have been tentatively identified recently. One is the p24 family of transmembrane proteins found both in yeast and mammals. These proteins, located essentially between the ER and the Golgi apparatus, recycle between these organelles and are incorporated into both COPI and COPII vesicles (18Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, their role is still unclear, as p23 in particular appeared to be restricted to a structural role rather than in sorting (23Rojo M. Pepperkok R. Emery G. Kellner R. Stang E. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1119-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In yeast, however, the deletion of members of this family delays the secretion of a subset of secretory protein (18Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26939-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Schimmöller F. Singer-Krüger B. Schröder S. Krüger U. Barlowe C. Riezmann H.

The cytoplasmic tail of mammalian p24 proteins interacts with coatomer (COPI) (26Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M. Rothman J. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), but we showed recently that it also binds specifically to the mammalian COPII component Sec23Ap via a di-aromatic motif (22Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Füllerkrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.-P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Another potential candidate as cargo receptor is the mannose-specific lectin-like transmembrane molecule ERGIC53/58. This protein cycles between the ER and the Golgi and is implicated in the forward transport of glycosylated proteins out of the ER (27Itin C. Foguet M. Kappeler F. Klumperman J. Hauri H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Its short cytosolic tail contains a KKFF retrieval motif which mediates its interaction with the COPI complex (29Schindler R. Itin C. Zerial M. Lottspeich F. Hauri H.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar), but also with the mammalian Sec23-24p complex, via its di-phenylalanine motif (30Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R.C. Foguet M. Paccaud J.-P. Hauri H.-P. J.

Collectively, these data suggest that COPII components may have a dual role during vesicle biogenesis; they participate both in the deformation of the lipid bilayer to shape up the vesicle and in the sorting of cargo. In this perspective, a likely component to function as an adaptor during the sorting process is the Sec23-24p complex. Interestingly, in the yeast genome at least two additional genes highly related to the essential SEC24 gene can be identified. In the present report, we investigated the role of these yeast genes in secretion, and we identify four new human proteins related to yeast Sec24p. The biochemical and morphological characterization of these proteins enabled us to demonstrate that they are indeed mammalian forms of Sec24p, with their corresponding conserved relatives inCaenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, andDrosophila melanogaster. Based on our findings, we propose that the multiple Sec23-24p complexes function as adaptors for subclasses of secretory cargo.

Yeast cultures and manipulations were done according to Guthrie and Fink (32Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; : 194Google Scholar), and unless otherwise stated, molecular biology procedures were performed as described by Ausubel et al. (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kinston R.E. Moore D.D.

Yeast strains were Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSY607 (MAT alfa, PEP4::URA3 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52) and PJ69-4A (Mat a, trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4_ gal4_80 LYS::GAL1-HIS3GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ;E. coli strains were DH5α and BL21/DE3-LysS. Based on the yeast Sec24 cDNA sequence used to screen ESTs data bases (34Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar, 35Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5509-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), two different probes were designed. The oligonucleotide 5′-TTAGCCTTGGACTGTTCTGGTCAGC-3′ derived from EST T79533 was used to screen for hSec24A; the primers 5′-TATTCTGCAGGGTGCATC-3′ and 3′-GAACGGACAAAGAAGTTAC-5′ (positions 221 and 407, respectively) were constructed based on the ESTZ43853 to obtain a 189-bp PCR product. These two probes were used to screen a size-selected human B lymphocyte cDNA library as described previously (11Paccaud J. Reith W. Carpentier J. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Orci L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the cDNA sequences selected was performed by primer walking in both directions. KIAA0079 cDNA was kindly provided to us by Dr. Nomura. The FLAG epitope was introduced at the 5′ end of hSec24B cDNA by PCR from position 159 to position 1349 in the cDNA sequence. The PCR product was subsequently subcloned into the XhoI andNheI sites of the pBSKS-hSec24B to obtain Flag-hSec24B. This epitope-tagged cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCiNeo. A similar strategy was used to produce Flag-hSec24C. All the constructs were verified by sequencing. Gene deletions were carried out according to the method of Baudinet al. (36Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), by PCR amplification of the HIS3gene with oligonucleotides that encode 40 bp of the gene-specific sequences from each end of the open reading frames to be deleted. The 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiment was performed using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit from Life Technologies, Inc. The antisense gene-specific primer used was 5′-CTGGTTGAAAAGTTGTAGG-3′ (positions 364–382 of hSec24A cDNA). Antibodies against hSec24B were prepared against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing aa 71–445 of hSec24B. The GST-hSec24B fusion construct was obtained by PCR from position 212 to position 1349. This PCR product was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-KG. Similarly, anti-Sec24C antibodies were obtained against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing aa 207–494 of the hSec24C. The constructions were verified by sequencing the entire PCR product. Affinity purification of antibodies was performed by coupling the immunogen to CNBr-activated Sepharose according to the manufacturer's indications. The affinity matrix was incubated with crude antiserum for 2 h at 4 °C, washed extensively with 20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, NaCl 150 mm; bound antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.0, and fractions were immediately neutralized by the addition of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. The antibody preparation was dialyzed against PBS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium azide. Cell extracts were either prepared as total Triton X-100 lysate or cytosol. For Triton X-100 extract, 5 × 106 cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 125 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and the following protease inhibitor, Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablets, from Boehringer Mannheim). To obtain cytosol, we resuspended HepG2 cells in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, 8% sucrose) and homogenized cells using 20 strokes of a tight-fitting glass Potter homogenizer in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Postnuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifuging at 2,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. This postnuclear supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Aliquots of cytosol were fractionated onto a Superdex 200 column, and fractions were analyzed as described previously (45.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C on 400 μg of Triton X-100 cell extracts using 5 μl of antiserum in a total volume of 500 μl. The precipitate was collected by adding 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads (1:1 slurry), washed five times with lysis buffer and once in 20 mm Tris, pH 6.8. The beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and then run on 9% polyacrylamide gels before being transferred to nitrocellulose. Total protein secretion assay was performed as described previously (37Gaynor E.C. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Media proteins were precipitated with ConA-Sepharose 4B (Sigma), and proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Total RNA from cultured cells was purified using the guanidinium acid-phenol method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Probes for hSec24A, -B, and -C were synthesized with T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of 50 μCi of [32P]UTP and purified on acrylamide-urea gel. Probes had a length of 365 (position 293–658 of cDNA), 126 (position 2128–2254), and 282 bp for hSec24A, -B, and -C, respectively. The hybridization, digestion, and analysis of the protected fragments were done as described previously (11Paccaud J. Reith W. Carpentier J. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Orci L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Monolayers of cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at RT. Cells were either permeabilized by dehydration and rehydration in ethanol or 0.2% saponin in PBS for 15 min. Primary antibodies were incubated for 2 h in a moist chamber at RT, followed by washing with PBS. Secondary antibodies FITC or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG were added for 1 h at RT. When appropriate, specific antibodies were first adsorbed with 50 μg of the recombinant immunogen for 30 min at RT prior to incubation with cells. The interaction between the central region of hSec24Cp and hSec23Ap was tested by the yeast two-hybrid method, as described by James et al. (39James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different portions of hSec24C cDNA were cloned into the vector pGBDU-C2 in frame with the GAL4 binding domain. The constructs prepared for the assay were the following: hSec24C1 (aa 198–807), hSec24C2 (aa 485–807), hSec24C3 (aa 198–694), hSec24C4 (aa 485–694), and hSec24C5 (aa 485–640). The entire coding sequence of hSec23A and two truncated forms, hSec23A/1 (aa 1–543) and hSec23A/2 (aa 1–256), were cloned into the vector pGAD-C1 in frame with the GAL4 activation domain. A search through the yeast genome using the sequence of yeast Sec24 (kindly provided to us by Randy Schekman) revealed the existence of two additional hypothetical proteins related to yeast Sec24p (referred to as YNE09 and YHP8, SWISS-PROT codes p53953 and p38810, respectively). YNE09 and YHP8 share 56 and 23%, respectively, of similarity with the essential yeast geneSEC24. The existence of yeast homologues of Sec24 proteins prompted us to investigate the consequences of their loss on secretion processes. We knocked out YNE09 and YHP8 alone or in combination, and the secretion of known secretory proteins such as invertase and CPY was assessed. We also monitored total protein secretion in the culture medium by pulse-chase experiments. Although the knock-out of yeast Sec24p is lethal (40Gimeno R. Espenshade P. Kaiser C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), 3T. Yoshihisa and R. Schekman, personal communication. the deletion of the two other orthologues of Sec24p YNE09 and YHP8 were viable, as well as the double knock-out. The pattern of secretion of CPY and invertase of knock-outs were indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells (not shown). We next analyzed the general profile of protein secreted in the supernatant after a pulse-chase with radioactive methionine. In order to potentiate any secretory defect caused by the absence of a given Sec24p, the cells were incubated at 37 °C; the viability of cells with a single as well as a double deletion was not affected by high temperature. However, when we examined the secretory pattern of such cells, selective secretory defects became apparent; the deletion of YHP8 prevented almost entirely the secretion of a small subset of proteins when incubated at 37 °C, a defect already noticed at 30 °C (Fig.1). The major proteins disappearing from the supernatant had a apparent molecular mass of about 55 and 100 kDa, whereas smaller species around 30 kDa were also affected but to a lesser extent (Fig. 1). The identity of the proteins selectively retained is currently under investigation. When we extended our data base search, it became apparent that highly related genes existed in other organisms such as mammals, worms, flies, or plants. We first identified three different human ESTs sharing a significant degree of homology with the probe. One EST pointed to an already cloned cDNA named KIAA0079 (GenBankTM accession number 1723050), which was kindly provided to us by Dr. Nomura. This cDNA encodes a protein of 1125 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 121 kDa. We used the remaining two EST sequences to probe a human cDNA library and isolated two human cDNAs: whereas one cDNA contained an apparently complete ORF, the other appeared incomplete at its 5′ end, because it lacked the initiator ATG codon. We performed a rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiment to obtain the 5′ end of the cDNA, and we extended our initial sequence by 360 base pairs, increasing the previous predicted ORF to a putative protein of about 118 kDa and a length of 1078 amino acids. However, the initiator ATG is still missing, and we are attempting alternative methods to obtain the complete ORF. This putative protein was named hSec24Ap (GenBankTM accession number AJ131244). The other cDNA encoded a protein of 1268 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 137 kDa and was named hSec24Bp (GenBankTM accession number AJ131245). Recently, an additional mRNA sequence named KIAA0755 (accession number 3882231) was added to GenBankTMand encodes a protein of 1032 amino acids related to our hSec24 sequences. We aligned these four human proteins using the multiple alignment analysis software Clustal W (41Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). We found a strong homology over the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of their length (Fig.2), and although their amino termini are divergent, the overall similarity between the four proteins is approximately 35%, but it increases up to 45% in the carboxyl-terminal region. From the alignment, hSec24A and -B are more closely related to each other than they are to KIAA0079 and KIAA0755 and vice versa. However, due to the evident similarity of these sequences with the other two human putative Sec24 proteins, we propose to rename KIAA0079 and KIAA0755, respectively, hSec24Cp and hSec24Dp. Sec24-related proteins are found in other organisms as well. InC. elegans, two hypothetical proteins of similar length were identified (GenBankTM accession numbers 1163046 and 137014) that share more than 45% similarity with hSec24Ap and hSec24Cp, respectively. An A. thaliana cDNA (GenBankTM accession number 3063706) encoding for a protein sharing up to 40% similarity with hSec24Cp was found. Finally, we identified a genomic DNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AC004340) ofD. melanogaster in which putative exons encode a protein sharing more than 65% similarity over ¾ of the length of hSec24Cp. Prosite pattern searching (42Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) did not retrieve any significant known protein motif within any member of the family. However, the alignment of all identified members of the Sec24 family revealed interesting features as follows: several entirely conserved positions are found throughout the carboxyl terminal two-thirds of the proteins, and in particular, a highly conserved region consisting of two tandems of cysteines separated by 17 or 18 amino acids reminiscent of a zinc finger-like domain can be considered as the typical signature of the family (underlined in Fig. 2). From the above analysis, we hypothesized that our cloned proteins are human Sec24 homologues. If this assumption is correct, the proteins should be confined to intracellular locations compatible with their putative role in ER vesicle formation, namely the transitional elements of the ER and the intermediate compartment, where other COPII components have been previously localized (10Tang B. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Paccaud J. Reith W. Carpentier J. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In order to verify this hypothesis, we tagged hSec24Bp and hSec24Cp at their amino termini with the FLAG epitope, and we expressed the constructs transiently in different human cell lines. We also isolated stable transfected clones of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing hSec24Cp. We first verified biochemically that the tagged proteins would behave as expected. Total cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with the FLAG monoclonal antibody. For hSec24Bp, a single band migrating at an apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa was detected using anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3 A). The same cell extracts were probed with polyclonal anti-hSec24Bp antibodies generated against a glutathione S-transferase fusion of the amino-terminal portion of hSec24B. This antibody specifically recognized two bands as follows: the slower migrating form having almost the same apparent molecular mass as the epitope-tagged hSec24Bp, and the lower band was estimated to have a molecular mass of about 135 kDa (Fig. 3 A). Affinity purified antibodies still recognized both bands, whereas the detection of both bands was abolished when using immuno-depleted antiserum. This doublet is seen in most human cell lines tested, although the relative intensity of the each band in the doublet appears to be cell type-specific (Fig. 3 B). We don't yet know the meaning of this doublet, but it may likely represent degradation products of the protein. More importantly, this antibody discriminates hSec24Bp from hSec24Cp (Fig. 3 A). The epitope-tagged hSec24Cp migrated at approximately the same molecular mass of about 120 kDa (Fig. 3 A). We then looked at the intracellular distribution of hSec24Bp by immunofluorescence in various human cell lines. By using antibodies against native hSec24Bp, the protein displayed a punctate pattern scattered throughout the cytoplasm along with a labeling around the perinuclear region (Fig. 4 A). The same analysis was done with an epitope-tagged construct transiently expressed in Hela cells; the epitope-tagged hSec24Bp distribution was"

Like the other members of the F-box protein family, human βTrCP, which we recently identified (37Margottin F. Bour S. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol.

We hypothesized that βTrCP could be the F-box adaptor protein allowing recruitment of IκBα by a SCF E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that ubiquitinates IκBα and makes it a substrate for degradation by the proteasome. Subconfluent cells of the 293 human embryo kidney cell line were transfected by LipofectAMINETM Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the indicated reporter plasmids and pcDNA3 vectors expressing βTrCP proteins or with no βTrCP insert.

Briefly, 293 cells were infected at a multiplicity of 5 for 6 h in serum-free medium with SFV particles carrying myc-tagged βTrCP proteins. Expression of βTrCP proteins and viral nucleocapsid protein was verified by Western blot analysis, and 100% infection efficiency was confirmed by immunofluorescence (data not shown). The same results as those shown in Fig. 2 B were obtained in HeLa cells infected with SFV. The 10B monoclonal antibody directed against the amino terminus of IκBα was described in Ref.43Jaffray E. Wood K. Hay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; the polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing IκBα phosphorylated at serine residue 32 is from New England Biolabs (9241S), and the monoclonal anti-myc antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (hybridoma 9E10, SC-40). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3, A and B), 200 μg of cytoplasmic extract were incubated with anti-myc-agarose conjugates (SC-40 AC from Santa Cruz) for 60 min at 4 °C. Precipitated beads were washed 10 times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and both protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Antibody-antigen complexes were disrupted by boiling in gel loading buffer (Pierce). Precipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with 4 μg of nuclear extract incubated for 15 min at room temperature with a [γ-32P]ATP-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the HIV-1 long terminal repeat binding site for NF-κB (5′-ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGACTTTCCAGGGA-3′). Samples were analyzed in nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. Competition experiments were performed by adding a 40-fold molar excess of homologous, unlabeled oligonucleotide to each sample prior to addition of the radiolabeled probe. To investigate the putative role of βTrCP in the regulation of NF-κB activation, we first assessed the effect of wild type (βTrCP) and a F-box deleted βTrCP (βTrCPΔF) (Fig.1 A) on the transcriptional activity of a NF-κB-dependent (3Enh-κB-ConA) promoter driving a luciferase reporter gene (10Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian A. Ciechanover A. Benneriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10599-10603Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 11Rodriguez M. Wright J. Thompson J. Thomas D. Baleux F. Virelizier J. Hay R. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2425-2435PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of βTrCP resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the activity of the 3Enh-κB-ConA promoter in cells of the 293 human embryo kidney cell line stimulated by either tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or okadaic acid (OKA), two well characterized inducers of NF-κB (Fig. 1 B,left panel). Similarly, the low level of constitutive activation of NF-κB found in unstimulated cells (compare 3Enh-κB-ConA to ConA) is also enhanced by expression of βTrCP (Fig.1 B, left panel). In sharp contrast to βTrCP, expression of the βTrCPΔF mutant massively and consistently inhibited NF-κB-dependent transcription by more than 90% of the levels induced in TNF- or OKA-stimulated cells transfected with an insertless, control plasmid (pcDNA3) (Fig. 1 B,left panel). Importantly, expression of the transdominant negative mutant βTrCPΔF fully prevented localization of NF-κB to the nucleus upon cell activation. This finding is in keeping with an increased stability of inhibitor IκB proteins that anchor NF-κB in the cytoplasm in an inactive form. The failure of βTrCPΔF to modify the activity of a RSV promoter indicates that βTrCPΔF does not affect NF-κB independent mechanisms of transcription (Fig.1 B, left panel). Thus, on the one hand, the capacity of βTrCP to enhance both basal or signal-induced activation of NF-κB and, on the other hand, the specific inhibition of NF-κB dependent transcription promoted by βTrCPΔF, strongly suggest that βTrCP is an essential component of the NF-κB activation pathway. In support of this assumption, we found that, concomitant with the enhancement of NF-κB-dependent transcription, overexpression of βTrCP in 293 cells stimulated by TNF induced an accelerated degradation of IκBα (Fig.2 A, middle panel). In contrast, expression of the βTrCPΔF mutant either from a eukaryotic vector (Fig. 2 A, right panel) or a SFV replicon (Fig. 2 B, right panel), stabilized IκBα and delayed the kinetics of IκBα degradation. Moreover, the presence of βTrCPΔF promoted the accumulation of slow migrating forms of IκBα characteristic of the phosphorylation of residues Ser32 and Ser36 required for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα by the proteasome (Fig. 2,A and B, right panel). Thus, these findings exclude an inhibitory effect of βTrCPΔF in the transduction pathway leading to phosphorylation of IκBα and suggest that stabilization of IκBα is due to the blockade of a post-phosphorylation event in the metabolism of the inhibitor. Slow migrating forms of IκBα predominated following induction with TNF but could even be detected in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2,A and B, right panel, time 0). This latter phenomenon likely reflects the inhibitory effect of βTrCPΔF on basal breakdown of IκBα and is in keeping with the low and constitutive NF-κB-dependent transcription observed in 293 cells (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Characterization of the slow migrating band of IκBα (Fig.2 A, right top panel), as a phosphorylated form of IκBα accumulated in βTrCPΔF expressing cells, was accomplished (Fig. 2 A, middle row of panels) using a polyclonal antibody that does not recognize the unphosphorylated form of IκBα but specifically reacts with Ser32–Ser36-phosphorylated IκBα which accumulates in the presence of the proteasome inhibitorz-LLL-h following induction with TNF (Fig.2 C) (44Palombella V. Rando O. Goldberg A. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the regulatory effect of βTrCP on IκBα metabolism requires association with IκBα, carboxyl-terminal c-myc-tagged variants of either βTrCP or βTrCPΔF were expressed in HeLa cells from SFV (Fig.3 A) or in 293 cells from eukaryotic expression vectors (Fig. 3 B), and their co-precipitation with IκBα was investigated. Cytoplasmic extracts of cells treated or not with TNF and the proteasome inhibitorz-LLL-h, were incubated with an anti-myc tag antibody bound to protein A-coated agarose beads. Proteins precipitated by the anti-myc antibody were probed with anti-IκBα antibodies (Fig. 3 A, middle and bottom panels). In cells expressing either the wild type or the mutated counterpart of βTrCP, a single band of co-precipitated IκBα was recognized by a monoclonal antibody that detects both native and phosphorylated forms of IκBα (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel, lanes 4–6). This band migrates with a pattern characteristic of the typical upshift induced by phosphorylation of IκBα Ser32 and Ser36. Western blot analysis using the antibody specifically recognizing the phosphoserine Ser32–Ser36 IκBα confirmed that the proteins detected are phosphorylated at the critical residues that permit subsequent ubiquitination of IκBα (Fig. 3 A,middle panel, lanes 4–6). No unphosphorylated form of IκBα was detected in immunoprecipitates (Fig.3 A, lower panel). Detection of phosphorylated IκBα did not require TNF induction when the mutant βTrCPΔF was expressed (Fig. 3 A, middle panel, lane 5). Moreover, larger amounts of endogenous phosphorylated IκBα co-precipitated with βTrCPΔF, compared with wild type βTrCP (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 6 with lane 4), confirming that the βTrCPΔF mutant acts as a transdominant negative regulator of both constitutive and TNF-induced proteolysis of IκBα. To confirm the selective association of phosphorylated IκBα and βTrCP, we performed experiments using a S32A/S36A mutant of IκBα lacking the capacity to be phosphorylated by cell activation signals promoting NF-κB activation (3Hiscott J. Beauparlant P. Crepieux P. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Petropoulos L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The presence of a 15-amino acid SV5 carboxyl terminus tag allows distinction of endogenous from transiently expressed wild type or S32A/S36A IκBα. Despite expression of similar amounts of wild type or S32A/S36A-SV5 tagged proteins (data not shown), only the endogenous and wild type SV5-tagged IκBα (Fig.3 B, lanes 4–6), but not the SV5-S32A/S36A phosphorylation-deficient mutant (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7–10) were able to associate with either βTrCP or βTrCPΔF. Expression of either wild type or phosphorylation-deficient tagged IκBα proteins from SFV was consistently detected in more than 90% of cells (data not shown). The high infection efficiency of this system allows us to conclude that co-precipitation of the endogenous, but not the S32A/S36A-SV5 IκBα (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7–10), reflects the incapacity of the phosphorylation-deficient mutant to compete for binding to IκBα. Further evidence of IκBα interaction with βTrCP was provided by the yeast two-hybrid system (carried out as described previously (37Margottin F. Bour S. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar)). We observed that βTrCP fused to the LexA DNA binding domain (LexA-βTrCP) associates specifically with IκBα fused to the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD-IκBα), as detected by histidine auxotrophy or β-galactosidase expression (Fig. 3 C). The interaction between IκBα and βTrCP is likely accounted for by the existence in yeast of phosphorylated IκBα as shown by the recognition of the Gal4AD-IκBα hybrid by the antibody that specifically reacts with Ser32–Ser36phosphorylated IκBα (Fig. 3 D). This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the Gal4AD-IκBα S32A/S36A mutant, which is not recognized by the anti-phosphoserine IκBα antibody (Fig.3 D), did not associate with LexA-βTrCP (Fig.3 C). We have previously documented that βTrCP is a component of a SCF complex involved in HIV-1 Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation. The WD domain of βTrCP is responsible for the interaction with Vpu (37Margottin F. Bour S. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Although βTrCP is involved in both Vpu-mediated CD4 and IκBα proteolysis, it should be stressed that important differences between the two degradation pathways exist. Indeed, if both Vpu and IκBα can be phosphorylated at serine in DSGXXS motifs, phosphorylation of Vpu occurs constitutively (45Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2260-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Friborg J. Ladha A. Gottlinger H. Haseltine W. Cohen E. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1995; 8: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) while that of IκBα requires activation of cell signaling. Furthermore, and in contrast to IκBα, Vpu has not yet been characterized as a substrate for ubiquitination or degradation by the proteasome. No human protein recognized as ubiquitination substrate by an SCF complex and undergoing degradation by the proteasome has been documented so far. IκBα phosphorylated at critical serine residues represents the first example of this kind of substrate (8Yaron A. Gonen H. Alkalay I. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Beyth S. Mercurio F. Manning A. Ciechanover A. Ben-Neriah Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6486-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In the SCF complexes with E3-ubiquitin-protein ligase activity, the F-box component allows specific recognition of substrates (28Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J. Elledge S.

Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The existence of a large number of F-box-containing proteins revealed by genome sequencing and the combinatorial interactions of SCF components that belong to different protein families (Cullin, E2 ubiquitin-protein conjugating enzymes) suggest that the growing family of E3 ligases is composed of a large number of different SCF complexes. This diversity has likely hampered the identification of the E3 ligase responsible for ubiquitin conjugation of IκBα required for IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation. While precise characterization of the ubiquitin conjugating activity associated with SCFβTrCP is still missing, our findings provide evidence that βTrCP is ultimately responsible for recognition of phosphorylated IκBα by the SCF complex. As shown for other F-box proteins in yeast, βTrCP could target different substrates as well as IκBα to the proteasome. This hypothesis is sustained by the recent discovery that, Slimb, theDrosophila homolog of βTrCP, may be involved in an as yet unidentified step of regulation of the wingless and hedgehog pathways (47Jiang J. Struhl G. Nature. 1998; 391: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be assumed from this that βTrCP is a broad, universal adaptor for ubiquitinated substrates. Indeed, in the SCF complex, F-box proteins determine and restrict substrate recognition by the proteasome. Thus, the yeast F-box protein Cdc4 is able to selectively bind phosphorylated Sic1, but not phosphorylated Cln1 or Cln2, whereas Grr1, another yeast F-box protein, shows selective association with the latter substrates but not with Sic1-(30–32). In conclusion, our findings characterize βTrCP as a F-box protein, which selectively associates with Ser32–Ser36phosphorylated, but not unmodified, IκBα. βTrCP represents the SCF adaptor which ultimately accounts for recognition of phosphorylated IκBα by the ubiquitination machinery and allows targeting of the ubiquitinated inhibitor to the proteasome (see model in Fig.4). While this manuscript was completed and sent for review, a report by Yaron et al. (48Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) was published that supports the involvement of βTrCP in IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation. Thus, βTrCP can be considered as a new target for pharmacological intervention in the physiopathological processes regulated by NF-κB.

Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 5Park I.-K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Mg-ATP-dependent form of PP1 can then be re-activated following phosphorylation of Thr-72 of inhibitor-2 by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3).PP1 is also regulated by its interaction with a variety of protein subunits that act in a manner distinct from the inhibitor proteins and that appear to target the catalytic subunit to specific subcellular compartments (1Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have indicated that PP1 interacts with phospho-DARPP-32 and the various binding subunits via a short amino acid motif. The exact sequence of the motif is not identical, but one or more basic amino acids is followed by two hydrophobic residues separated by a variable amino acid. In DARPP-32 the motif is found between residues 6 and 11 (RKKIQF). Furthermore, our studies of DARPP-32 have suggested that residues 6–11 bind to PP1 at a site removed from the active site and that this interaction is not directly involved in inhibition of enzyme activity (11Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PP1 by phospho-DARPP-32 requires phospho-Thr-34, which is likely to occupy the active site of the enzyme in a manner in which catalysis cannot take place (11Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Elliott J.I.

A. 1997; 94: 3530-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).The identification of the basic/hydrophobic motif in DARPP-32 and the other binding subunits provides a structural basis for their interaction with PP1 in a mutually exclusive manner. However, much less is known about the interaction of inhibitor-2 with PP1. There is no obvious amino acid sequence identity between inhibitor-2 and DARPP-32 or the other binding subunits. Proteolysis studies failed to identify short regions of inhibitor-2 that retained the properties of the holoprotein (18Holmes C.F. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Aitken A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, initial truncation mutagenesis studies indicated that residues 1–35 were important for inhibition but not for inactivation and complex formation and that a region of the COOH terminus was required for reactivation (5Park I.-K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the lack of information concerning the interaction of inhibitor-2 with PP1, we have carried out a detailed structure-function analysis of the protein. We have also characterized further the roles of amino acids within the PP1 binding motif of DARPP-32 and those surrounding phospho-Thr-34 of the protein. Finally we have used peptide competition studies to compare the interaction of inhibitor-2 and phospho-DARPP-32 with PP1. The results obtained indicate that distinct amino acid motifs contained within the NH2 termini of phospho-DARPP-32 (KKIQF, where bold indicates important residues) and inhibitor-2 (IKGI) are critical for inhibition of PP1 and are likely to bind to different sites on the enzyme, both of which are removed from the active site. This study therefore identifies a novel mode of interaction of PP1 with its target proteins and extends our understanding of this growing family of important regulatory molecules that regulate cell signaling through control of serine/threonine dephosphorylation.DISCUSSIONThe results from the present study suggest that phospho-DARPP-32 and inhibitor-2, two heat-stable inhibitors of PP1, interact with the catalytic subunit via different mechanisms that involve the interaction of common and distinct subdomains within the two inhibitors. Interaction of PP1 with either inhibitor requires at least two subdomains within each protein (Fig.8 A). In the case of phospho-DARPP-32, these two subdomains are included between residues 6 and 38. Residues close to, and including the phosphorylated form of Thr-34, define subdomain 1, and a short motif between residues 7 and 11 (KKIQF) defines subdomain 2. In the case of inhibitor-2, a larger part of the molecule (residue 9 to approximately residue 99) is required for inhibition. A short NH2-terminal amino acid motif (IKGI, subdomain 3) is located between residues 10 and 13 of inhibitor-2. Subdomain 2 in DARPP-32 and subdomain 3 in inhibitor-2 both include basic and hydrophobic amino acids that are important for inhibition of PP1. However, these motifs are unrelated to each other and bind to different regions of the catalytic subunit that are both removed from the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 8 B). Inhibitor-2 also contains a region between residues 15 and 84 that binds or overlaps the part of PP1 that interacts with subdomain 2 of DARPP-32. For phospho-DARPP-32, inhibition of PP1 requires the interaction of phospho-Thr-34 with the active site of the enzyme or with residues very close to the active site. In the case of inhibitor-2, inhibition of PP1 presumably requires the interaction of residues between 15 and 84 with the active site of the enzyme or with residues close to the active site.This study extends our investigations of the role of subdomains 1 and 2 of phospho-DARPP-32 in the interaction with PP1 (11Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Elliott J.I. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20369-20376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies had indicated that phospho-Thr-34 is essential for potent inhibition of PP1; notably a peptide containing phosphoserine in place of phosphothreonine was ineffective as an inhibitor (16Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Elliott J.I. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20369-20376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of residues in the active site of PP1 had a parallel effect on the inhibitory potency of phospho-DARPP-32 and a variety of toxins that are known to interact with the active site (17Huang H.B. Horiuchi A. Goldberg J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3530-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of residues away from the active site of PP1 was able to influence the ability of the enzymes to either be inhibited by phospho-DARPP-32 or alternatively to dephosphorylate phospho-Thr-34 (17Huang H.B. Horiuchi A. Goldberg J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3530-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Whereas the underlying structural basis for the latter result is not known, these results suggest in native PP1 that phospho-Thr-34 interacts with residues close to or in the active site in a manner in which it cannot be dephosphorylated. The fact that mutation of Pro-33 and Pro-35 reduces the inhibitory potency of phospho-DARPP-32 suggests that these two residues that flank phospho-Thr-34 may be involved in this interaction.The results also extend our knowledge of the precise role played by specific amino acids within the basic/hydrophobic motif that is found in subdomain 2 of DARPP-32 and within subdomains of a growing number of PP1-binding proteins (4He B.

The exact sequence of the motif is not identical, but one or more basic amino acids is followed by two hydrophobic residues separated by a variable amino acid. The first of the two hydrophobic amino acids is either valine or isoleucine, and the second hydrophobic residue is phenylalanine (11Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the interaction of this BB(V/I)XF motif with PP1 has recently been determined using x-ray crystallography (12Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Six residues (RRVSFA) of a 13-residue peptide containing the PP1-binding domain of GM are ordered in the crystal structure and interact in an extended manner with a hydrophobic channel situated on the side opposite from that of the active site of PP1. Interactions are found between the side chains of the valine and phenylalanine in the peptide and solvent-exposed hydrophobic side chains in PP1. Electrostatic interactions are also found between the two arginine residues in the peptide and acidic residues in PP1.In the present study, mutation of Ile-9 to glycine reduced the inhibitory potency of phospho-DARPP-32. Mutation to alanine was largely accommodated, suggesting that there is some flexibility in the identity of the hydrophobic amino acid at this position. Mutation of Phe-11 to alanine reduced inhibitory potency; however, phospho-DARPP-32 in which Phe-11 was mutated to tryptophan retained full inhibitory potency. A random peptide library analysis has indicated that tryptophan may substitute for phenylalanine (15Zhao S. Lee E.Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, our recent studies have indicated that tryptophan is the residue found in this position in the PP1 binding motif of the nuclear targeting, PP1-binding subunit, PNUTS (9Allen P.B. Kwon Y.G. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4089-4095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). 2Y.-S. Kwon, P. Allen, M. Konarsha, P. Greengard, and A. C. Nairn, unpublished results. Mutation of Lys-7 (to glutamate) had a relatively small effect on inhibitory potency. Unexpectedly, mutation of Lys-8 (to glutamate) had no effect. These results suggest that, within the binding motif, basic amino acids play a lesser role than the hydrophobic residues in binding to PP1 and that the relative role of the multiple basic amino acids may vary in different PP1-binding proteins. Importantly, whereas the BB(V/I)XF motif is found in virtually all PP1-binding proteins, the relative affinity of the different proteins varies considerably. For example, the dephospho- and phospho-forms of DARPP-32 bind to PP1 with approximate micromolar K d values (23Desdouits F. Cheetham J.J. Huang H.-B. Kwon Y.-G. Da Cruz e Silva E.F. Denefle P. Ehrlich M.E. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Girault J.-A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As a result, DARPP-32 is not retained by PP1 using affinity chromatography or identified as a PP1-binding protein in immunoprecipitation or overlay assays (data not shown). Mutation of Phe-11 of DARPP-32 to tryptophan did not alter the apparent affinity for PP1, as measured by the overlay assay (data not shown). Thus whereas the BB(V/I)XF motif is essential for binding of DARPP-32 and other proteins to PP1, additional interaction at one or more sites influences the overall affinity between PP1 and its binding subunits.The distance between the two subdomains of phospho-DARPP-32 appears to be important since deletion of residues 15–18 reduced inhibitory potency. In contrast, insertion of three amino acids in this region had no effect. Combined mutation of three hydrophobic residues between the two subdomains resulted in a marked reduction in inhibitory potency. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of DARPP-32 and inhibitor-1 between subdomains 2 and 1 reveals limited identity (16Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Elliott J.I. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20369-20376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Leu-20 and Ile-28 are conserved, and Val-25 is an alanine residue in inhibitor-1, suggesting that hydrophobic contacts with PP1 may be important within this region of the two proteins. Circular dichroism studies of DARPP-32 3H. C. Hemmings, unpublished observations. and inhibitor-1 (33Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have indicated that both proteins are largely disordered in structure. These hydrophobic residues could therefore interact in an extended conformation with surface-exposed hydrophobic amino acids in PP1. Alternatively, the region between the subdomains of DARPP-32 may have the ability to form an amphipathic α-helix upon binding to PP1.Assuming that Phe-11 of DARPP-32 interacts with PP1 in the same way as Phe-68 of the GM peptide (12Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), and phospho-Thr-34 interacts with the active site of the enzyme, there are several alternative ways in which intervening residues could interact with PP1. We have previously suggested, based on initial modeling studies, that the basic amino acid side chains in residues 29–32 might interact with several acidic amino acids present in a groove close to the active site of PP1 (34Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). However, this model is not supported by the present results that indicated that Arg-29 and Arg-30 did not make a major contribution to the interaction of DARPP-32 with PP1. In addition, mutation of several of the acidic amino acids in PP1, either singly or in combination, did not reduce the inhibitory potency of phospho-DARPP-32 (17Huang H.B. Horiuchi A. Goldberg J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3530-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Given that many of these acidic residues are found only in the catalytic subunit of PP1, but not PP2A and PP2B, it remains an attractive possibility that they play a role in binding other PP1-binding proteins. Alternative modes of binding for phospho-DARPP-32 could include the following: interaction 1) with residues in the COOH-terminal groove that also emanates from the active site of the enzyme, or 2) with the β12-β13 loop situated above the active site in a manner similar to that of the autoinhibitory segment of PP2B (35Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Gastinel L.N. Habuka N. Chen X.H. Maldonado F. Barker J.E. Bacquet R. Villafranca J.E. Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar).The results obtained from the present studies indicate that the first half of inhibitor-2 (approximately residues 9–99) retains the same inhibitory qualities as the wild-type protein. A subdomain including residues 10–13 defines a novel PP1 binding motif (IKGI) that is distinct from that identified in subdomain 2 of DARPP-32 (KKIQF). These results extend previous studies that had indicated an important role for the NH2-terminal 35 residues of the protein in inhibition of PP1 (5Park I.-K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the novel PP1 binding region, residues 15–84 of inhibitor-2 also contain a second region that binds or overlaps the part of PP1 that interacts with DARPP-32, and these distinct but overlapping modes of binding of DARPP-32 and inhibitor-2 to PP1 are consistent with previous kinetic studies (36Foulkes J.G. Strada S.J. Henderson P.J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary structure of inhibitor-2 had failed to identify any obvious similarity to DARPP-32, inhibitor-1, or other PP1-binding proteins (11Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,18Holmes C.F. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Aitken A. Cohen P. Eur.

Chem. 1994; 269: 944-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitor-2 is, however, similar in sequence to the Glc8 protein, an apparent functional homolog identified inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (38Tung H.Y.L. Wang W.F. Chan C.S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The level of amino acid identity in inhibitor-2 and Glc8 is low (28% over 190 residues), but there are several short stretches of the two proteins that are highly conserved, including the region around Thr-72 (of inhibitor-2). Based on a previous alignment of the amino acid sequences of inhibitor-2 and Glc8 (38Tung H.Y.L. Wang W.F. Chan C.S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), residues 10–14 of inhibitor-2 (IKGI) are IPGL in Glc8 (residues 48–51). Interestingly, in inhibitor-2 the sequence KKSQKW (residues 41–46) is conserved as EERVQW in Glc8 (residues 88–93), the latter sequence in Glc8 containing a sequence equivalent to the PP1 binding motif found in subdomain 2 of DARPP-32. Little is known about the biochemical properties of Glc8, but it is possible that these regions of inhibitor-2 and Glc8 represent functionally conserved PP1 binding regions that have diverged through evolution.An important question raised by these and previous studies relates to whether part of inhibitor-2 interacts with the active site of PP1. Kinetic studies indicate that inhibitor-2 is a competitive inhibitor when phosphorylase a is used as a substrate (36Foulkes J.G. Strada S.J. Henderson P.J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Inhibitor-2 also competes with binding of okadaic acid and microcystin to PP1 (39MacKintosh C. Beattie K.A. Klumpp S. Cohen P. Codd G.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar, 40Picking W.D. Kudlicki W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. Park I.-K. DePaoli-Roach A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10280-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and both of these toxins have been found to bind to the active site of PP1 (17Huang H.B. Horiuchi A. Goldberg J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3530-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of amino acids between residues 76 and 85 of inhibitor-2 resulted in PP1·inhibitor-2 complexes that showed high constitutive activity, in contrast to the normally inactive complex obtained with wild-type proteins (5Park I.-K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These various studies all point to the conclusion that part of inhibitor-2, including residues 76–85, either interacts directly with the active site of PP1 or with residues close to the active site in a manner that blocks binding of peptide substrate (see Fig. 8 B).The overlay analysis suggested that residues 9–14 contribute to a high affinity interaction between inhibitor-2 and PP1. Whereas our studies focused on the mechanism of inhibition and not of complex formation or inactivation of PP1, preliminary results indicated that residues 1–99 of inhibitor-2 were able to form a stable complex with PP1. Potentially, binding of residues 9–14 to PP1 might represent a first step in the interaction of inhibitor-2 with PP1 that ultimately results in complex formation and inactivation following the binding of other parts of the two proteins. The overlay analysis also suggested that residues 141–159 of inhibitor-2 are involved in binding to PP1. However, deletion and site-directed mutagenesis and peptide c"

Focusing on the ubiquitous γ-isoform of PAK in this study, baculovirus-infected insect cells were used to obtain recombinant γ-PAK, while native γ-PAK was isolated from rabbit reticulocytes. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of γ-PAK followed by immunoblot analysis revealed a similar profile for native and recombinant γ-PAK, both consisting of multiple protein spots. Following Cdc42-stimulated autophosphorylation, the two-dimensional profiles of native and recombinant γ-PAK were characterized by a similar acidic shift, suggesting a common response to Cdc42. To understand the effect of differential phosphorylation on its activation status, γ-PAK autophosphorylation was conducted in the presence or absence of activators such as Cdc42 and histone II-AS, followed by tryptic digestion and comparative two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. The major phosphopeptides were subjected to a combination of manual and automated amino acid sequencing. Overall, eight autophosphorylation sites were identified in Cdc42-activated γ-PAK, six of which are in common with those previously reported in α-PAK, while Ser-19 and Ser-165 appear to be uniquely phosphorylated in the γ-form. Further, the phosphorylation of Ser-141, Ser-165, and Thr-402 was found to correlate with γ-PAK activation. p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) is a family of serine/threonine kinases whose activity is stimulated by binding to small G-proteins such as Cdc42 and subsequent autophosphorylation. Focusing on the ubiquitous γ-isoform of PAK in this study, baculovirus-infected insect cells were used to obtain recombinant γ-PAK, while native γ-PAK was isolated from rabbit reticulocytes.

These PAKs are characterized by a highly conserved domain in the N-terminal, regulatory region for binding of small G-proteins such as Cdc42 and Rac.

Historically, γ-PAK was first identified in rabbit reticulocytes as an inactive holoenzyme, whose protein kinase activity toward substrates such as histone 2B and histone 4 was inducible by limited tryptic digestion (11Tahara S.M.

Over the past few years, PAK activation has been implicated in a number of signaling pathways, including those stimulated during cell growth and differentiation (13Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.C.

A. 1997; 94: 13642-13647Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, within a broad range of biochemical contexts, autophosphorylation has been consistently reported as a common trait of γ-PAK activation. Recently α-PAK has been shown to be activated by sphingolipids (20Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), while some substrates (e.g. histones 4 and 2B) were found to induce activation of γ-PAK (21Jakobi R. Huang Z.D. Walter B.N. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. FASEB J. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 342Google Scholar). The finding that α-PAK undergoes autophosphorylation on residues in the N-terminal region and on a single residue in the C-terminal domain (22Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with a role for the N terminus in regulating the protein kinase activity of PAK. Previous studies from this laboratory (17Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have shown that autophosphorylation of the regulatory and catalytic domains is required for activation of γ-PAK following caspase cleavage. Taken together, these data suggest that multisite autophosphorylation regulates the activity of this family of kinases. However, to date, only the autophosphorylation sites on α-PAK have been fully described (22Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The only autophosphorylation site identified in γ-PAK is Thr-402, which has been shown to be involved in activation of the protein kinase (17Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Yu J.-S. Chen W.-J. Ni M.-H. Chan W.-H. Yang S.-D. Biochem.

One of the main objectives of this study is to understand which of the multiple autophosphorylation events is involved in γ-PAK activation. Taking into consideration the possibility that the post-translational changes of a baculovirus-expressed form of γ-PAK might be substantially different from those occurring in mammalian cells, two-dimensional profiles of recombinant γ-PAK were compared with native γ-PAK purified from rabbit reticulocytes, before and after exposure to Cdc42(GTPγS) or histone II-AS. Tryptic phosphopeptides were generated by digestion of the autophosphorylated recombinant γ-PAK and fractionated using a two-dimensional peptide gel system (25Gatti A. Traugh J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Comparative phosphopeptide mapping was carried out to characterize the phosphorylation status of inactive and active γ-PAK and to allow the identification of those phosphopeptides whose presence is indicative of γ-PAK activation. The sequence of each phosphopeptide was identified by automated sequencing, while the position of the phosphoresidue was determined by monitoring the release of radioactivity via manual Edman degradation. All chemicals were from Sigma if not otherwise indicated. Ampholines (pH 3.5–10 and 3.5–5) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Zwittergent 3–16 was from Calbiochem; nitrocellulose was from Schleicher & Schuell. The polyclonal antibody to γ-PAK protein was prepared in rat as described previously (26Rooney R.D. Tuazon P.T. Meek W.E. Carroll Jr., E.J. Hagen J.J. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Lugo T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21498-21504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Anti-Ste20-subdomain VI antibody (anti-Ste20-VI) that is specific for the catalytic domain of all three isoforms of PAK was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Organon Teknika. The chemioluminescent detection system was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cellophane membrane backing sheets were from Bio-Rad, C18 cartridges (Sep-Pak, 50 mg) were from Waters, and arylamine disks (Sequelon-AA type) were from PerSeptive Biosystems. A sequencer (Procise 492) from Applied Biosystems was used for amino acid microsequencing. The peptide substrate S3 (AKRESAA) was synthesized as described previously (26Rooney R.D. Tuazon P.T. Meek W.E. Carroll Jr., E.J. Hagen J.J. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Lugo T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21498-21504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cDNA for rabbit γ-PAK was cloned into the pAcG2T vector and used to transfect TN5B-4 cells as described elsewhere (17Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose, cleaved with thrombin and eluted (17Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After thrombin cleavage, the N terminus of the recombinant protein contained the following five residues derived from the fusion protein: Gly, Ser, Leu, Gly, and His. Native γ-PAK was purified from the postribosomal supernatant of rabbit reticulocytes by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, SP-Sepharose, protamine-agarose, and Mono Q columns (24Tuazon P.T. Chinwah M. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17024-17029Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of native (0.05–0.1 μg) and recombinant (0.5–5 μg) γ-PAK was carried out in a 20–40 μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mm[γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol). Cdc42 (0.5–2 μg), prepared as described by Jakobi and colleagues (8Jakobi R. Chen C.J. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6206-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was preloaded with 0.18 mm GTPγS for 10 min at 30 °C prior to addition to the reaction. When indicated, histone II-AS was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The autophosphorylation reactions were terminated after 30 min at 30 °C by the addition of either 20 μl of 2× concentrated sample buffer for standard polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) or 100 μl of sample buffer for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (two-dimensional PAGE). For the analysis of substrate phosphorylation, the above reaction contained peptide S3 (1 mm), a synthetic substrate of γ-PAK (27Tuazon P.T. Spanos W.C. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16059-16064Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After incubation, the reaction mix was diluted with 6m urea in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and subjected to a 40% alkaline peptide PAGE, as described by West and colleagues (28West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the basis of the high reticulation feature, this gel allowed an accurate resolution of the peptide band and the subsequent quantitation of phosphorylation. Samples were either subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) or to two-dimensional PAGE, consisting of gel isoelectrofocusing followed by 10% SDS-PAGE as described previously (30Gatti A. Robinson P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar) and stained with 0.5% (w/v) Ponceau in 1% acetic acid prior to autoradiography. When indicated, the proteins were stained with 0.1% (w/v) Amido Black in 25% methanol and 10% acetic acid. For Western blotting, the nitrocellulose was probed with a polyclonal anti-PAK antibody, as described previously (26Rooney R.D. Tuazon P.T. Meek W.E. Carroll Jr., E.J. Hagen J.J. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Lugo T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21498-21504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This antibody has been shown to recognize γ-PAK (26Rooney R.D. Tuazon P.T. Meek W.E. Carroll Jr., E.J. Hagen J.J. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Lugo T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21498-21504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and to react specifically with the regulatory region (17Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In some cases, immunorecognition was carried out with anti-Ste20-VI, a commercially available antibody raised against a peptide of the catalytic domain, which immunoreacted with α-, β-, and γ-PAK. Immunoreactivity was detected with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using the ECL method. After one- or two-dimensional electrophoresis and transfer, 32P-labeled γ-PAK was excised from the nitrocellulose and digested with trypsin, as described (32Lui M. Tempst P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled tryptic phosphopeptides were analyzed by two-dimensional peptide PAGE, as described elsewhere (25Gatti A. Traugh J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots (20–80 μl) of the digested protein were subjected to nondenaturing isoelectric focusing in gel tubes followed in the second dimension by electrophoresis on a 40% polyacrylamide alkaline slab gel. Prior to autoradiography, the gel was coated with a cellophane membrane backing sheet and dried under vacuum. When indicated, the samples extracted from individual labeled spots of two-dimensional peptide gels were subjected to 16% SDS-PAGE in Tris-Tricine buffer, as described by Schagger and von Jagow (33Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar). After autoradiography, the radioactive tryptic phosphopeptides were individually excised from the 40% gel and incubated in 2 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid overnight at room temperature. The eluted phosphopeptides were subjected to a cleanup procedure using C18 cartridges (50 mg), as described elsewhere (25Gatti A. Traugh J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The final eluates were taken to dryness prior to Cerenkov counting of the radioactivity. Each lyophilized phosphopeptide was dissolved in 20 μl of 30% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and covalently bound to a disk of arylamine membrane (Sequelon-AA type) as described by the supplier. The disk was routinely cut in two parts: approximately ¾ of the disk was used for automated sequencing, while the remaining ¼ of the disk was subjected to manual Edman degradation as described by Sullivan and Wong (34Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Multiple autophosphorylation of γ-PAK was analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE. In order to visualize the effect of autophosphorylation, both native γ-PAK purified from rabbit reticul- ocytes and recombinant γ-PAK expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells were incubated with Cdc42(GTPγS) in the presence of [γ-32P]MgATP. After two-dimensional PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and detected with an antibody previously shown to recognize the regulatory domain of γ-PAK (17Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Using this approach, γ-PAK was resolved into a number of differentially migrating immunoreactive species with distinct pI values (Fig. 1 A). Treatment of native γ-PAK with activated Cdc42 produced an acidic shift in the immunoreactive profile of γ-PAK (Fig. 1 B), with a disappearance of the forms migrating 4.8–5.5 cm from the basic origin and the concomitant appearance of γ-PAK forms migrating further (5.4–6.2 cm). To verify the correspondence between changes in the electrophoretic profile and autophosphorylation, Cdc42-stimulated,32P-labeled γ-PAK was also detected by autoradiography. The vast majority of the radiolabeled native γ-PAK was present in the highly acidic forms that migrated 5.4–6.2 cm from the basic origin, while little radioactivity was associated with the other isoelectric forms. (Fig. 1 C). When recombinant γ-PAK was subjected to the same experimental protocol, the resulting immunoreactivity and autoradiographic profiles were similar, if not identical, to those of native γ-PAK. The acidic change in the profile after Cdc42-stimulated autophosphorylation resulted in the disappearance of forms migrating 4.8–5.5 cm from the basic origin (Fig. 2 A), with the concomitant appearance of γ-PAK forms migrating at 5.5–6.7 cm (Fig. 2 B). The latter corresponded to the highly acidic radiolabeled forms as assessed by autoradiography (Fig.2 C). When recombinant γ-PAK was incubated with MgATP only, an acidic shift was detected via protein staining and immunorecognition (Fig.3), indicating an increase in phosphate over the mock-treated sample. However, this shift was limited as compared with that obtained in the presence of Cdc42(GTPγS) (compare Fig. 3 D with Fig. 2 B). This supports the conclusion that Cdc42(GTPγS) is required for maximal autophosphorylation of γ-PAK. Analogous results were obtained when parallel two-dimensional blots were probed with anti-Ste20-VI (data not shown). Having found substantial identity in the two-dimensional immunoblot profiles of native and recombinant γ-PAK, we set out to investigate how changes in γ-PAK autophosphorylation correlated with protein kinase activity toward exogenous substrates, and in particular whether specific phosphopeptides were indicative of γ-PAK activation. Following incubation of γ-PAK with radiolabeled MgATP alone and in the presence of the activators Cdc42(GTPγS) or histone II-AS, γ-PAK autophosphorylation was assessed by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE. Jakobi and colleagues (8Jakobi R. Chen C.J. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6206-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Jakobi R. Huang Z.D. Walter B.N. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. FASEB J. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 342Google Scholar) have shown that Cdc42(GTPγS) or histone 4 stimulated autophosphorylation of recombinant γ-PAK up to 4-fold. In the present study, γ-PAK autophosphorylation was stimulated 5.1- and 6.2-fold by Cdc42(GTPγS) and histone II-AS, respectively (Fig. 4). After tryptic digestion of autophosphorylated γ-PAK, two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps were obtained by a combination of native isoelectrofocusing and high reticulation polyacrylamide peptide gels (25Gatti A. Traugh J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled spots with assigned numbers, as shown in Fig. 4, represent the major phosphopeptides of γ-PAK that were consistently observed in repeated experiments. A qualitatively similar profile was obtained with in vitro autophosphorylated native γ-PAK (data not shown). Comparative phosphopeptide mapping showed a clear difference between the phosphopeptide maps of γ-PAK incubated only with MgATP (Fig. 4 A) and γ-PAK activated by Cdc42 (Fig.4 B). Consistent with the observation that histone was capable of activating γ-PAK (21Jakobi R. Huang Z.D. Walter B.N. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. FASEB J. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 342Google Scholar), the phosphopeptide map of γ-PAK autophosphorylated in the presence of histone II-AS (Fig.4 C) was identical to the map of Cdc42-activated γ-PAK. Upon repeated experiments, the specific accumulation of spots 7, 9, 11, and 13 in the samples of γ-PAK treated with Cdc42 or histone suggested a correlation between the acquisition of a specific phosphorylation state and protein kinase activation. To show that γ-PAK was activated by Cdc42, γ-PAK autophosphorylated in the presence or absence of Cdc42(GTPγS) was assayed with peptide S3. Autoradiography of the dried gel (Fig.5) following alkaline 40% PAGE showed a 3-fold increase in γ-PAK activity in the presence of Cdc42(GTPγS). The activity of γ-PAK in the absence of Cdc42 was probably due to small amounts of fully autophosphorylated and activated forms in the recombinant γ-PAK sample, as suggested by the presence of trace amounts of spots 7, 9, and 13 in the respective two-dimensional peptide map (see Fig. 4). To identify the sequence and the phosphoresidue of the major phosphopeptides from Cdc42-stimulated γ-PAK, an experimental strategy based on the combination of automated and manual amino acid sequencing was employed as described elsewhere (25Gatti A. Traugh J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In particular, the major radiolabeled spots 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 from the two-dimensional peptide gel of Cdc42-stimulated γ-PAK were isolated and subjected to a cleanup procedure prior to sequence analysis. The amount of phosphopeptide present in the minor spots was too small to be successfully sequenced (data not shown). In case of spots 10, 12, and 13, the amino acids were unambiguously identified by automated sequencing, and the vast majority of the32P was released at a single cycle during manual sequencing. The information resulting from manual Edman degradation and from automated sequencing clearly identified Ser-192, Ser-197, and Thr-402 as the phosphorylation sites of phosphopeptides present in spots 10, 12, and 13, respectively (Fig.6, A–C). In case of phosphopeptide 4, manual sequencing revealed a substantial release of 32P at both cycles 2 and 3 (Fig. 6 D). Both of these residues were serine, rendering it impossible to deduce whether the peptide was diphosphorylated or consisted of a mixture of two phosphopeptides, each one phosphorylated on a single site. For a number of reasons explained under “Discussion,” we conclude that the latter option is the most plausible. Another case in which the majority of radioactivity was not released at a single cycle of Edman degradation was spot 9 (Fig.7 A). As shown by automated sequencing, this spot consisted of a peptide starting with Val-161, which was phosphorylated at Ser-165, plus a second peptide, which started with phosphorylated Ser-197. The presence of the latter, a proteolytic product of phosphopeptide 12, explained why radioactivity was released in the first as well as the fourth cycle. That spot 9 consisted of more than a single phosphopeptide was confirmed by close inspection of a two-dimensional peptide map (Fig. 7 B), wherein the time of isoelectrofocusing in the first dimension was extended to maximize the resolution of phosphopeptides with different pIs. Similarly, in case of spot 11, automated sequencing revealed the presence of two equally abundant tryptic phosphopeptides, namely the peptide starting with Ile-53, which was phosphorylated on Ser-55, plus the peptide starting from Tyr-139 and phosphorylated on Ser-141 (Fig.8 A). These two peptides not only comigrated in the two-dimensional peptide gel system but also had in common a phosphoserine in the third position. However, when autophosphorylation of γ-PAK was carried out in the absence of Cdc42(GTPγS), spot 11 contained a predominant phosphopeptide starting with Ile-53 and trace amounts of a second phosphopeptide, as shown by automated sequencing (Fig. 8 B). The notion that spot 11 of inactive γ-PAK consisted of one major phosphopeptide, while two distinct phosphopeptides were present equally in spot 11 of Cdc42-stimulated γ-PAK, was confirmed by submitting the samples to another electrophoretic system consisting of a 16% polyacrylamide gel run in Tris-Tricine buffer containing SDS (Fig. 8 C). The presence of SDS in the latter gel allowed the resolution of these phosphopeptides. This conclusion is fully consistent with previous sequence analysis (25Gatti A. Traugh J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) of autophosphorylation sites in the N-terminal peptide of γ-PAK. Therefore, comparative phosphopeptide mapping allowed a clear identification of Ser-55 and Ser-141 as two distinct sites in spot 11 from Cdc42-activated γ-PAK, and of Ser-55 as the only site in spot 11 after autophosphorylation of γ-PAK with MgATP alone. Several baculovirus-expressed mammalian proteins have been reported to be functionally indistinguishable from the corresponding native proteins. It has also been observed that the sites phosphorylated on proteins expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and mammalian cells are often the same (35McDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kozma S.C. McGlynn E. Siegmann M. Reinhard C. Ferrari S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7134-7138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we compared the immunoblot profiles of native and recombinant γ-PAK by two-dimensional PAGE. Both recombinant and native forms were resolved into several differentially migrating forms, thus validating the choice to use the baculovirus-expressed γ-PAK for sequencing the autophosphorylation sites. Comparative phosphopeptide mapping of γ-PAK autophosphorylation with or without Cdc42(GTPγS) or histone II-AS revealed that spots 7, 9, and 13 were present only in the map of activated γ-PAK and that spot 11 was increased (see Fig. 4). As aforementioned, recent evidence has indicated that autophosphorylation is a common feature of γ-PAK activation within a broad variety of signaling pathways. Therefore, the autophosphorylation pattern, as assessed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, may represent a useful index of PAK activation. This is supported by our previous finding that γ-PAK autophosphorylation precedes activation, regardless of whether the holoenzyme is activated by Cdc42(GTPγS) or by caspase 3 (17Walter B.N. Huang Z.

Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17024-17029Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To directly investigate the exact positions of the Cdc42-inducible autophosphorylation sites, we employed a combination of high resolution phosphopeptide mapping with manual and automated amino acid sequencing (25Gatti A. Traugh J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In most cases, each spot on the two-dimensional peptide map consisted of an individual phosphopeptide whose radioactivity was released primarily during a single cycle, indicating that the majority of phosphopeptides contained a single autophosphorylation site. Manual sequencing of spot 4 revealed an approximately equal release of radioactivity in the second and third cycle, corresponding to Ser-19 and Ser-20, respectively. There are at least three potential explanations for such an outcome: (i) artifactual tailing of32P release at the cycle corresponding to the residue adjacent to the bona fide phosphoresidue; (ii) dual phosphorylation at the adjacent sites of Ser-19 and Ser-20; and (iii) partial phosphorylation at either Ser-19 or Ser-20. For a number of reasons, the first two options do not apply to this case. First, in our hands the extent of 32P tailing deriving from a site adjacent to a phosphoresidue is routinely very limited. Second, in line with the typically extensive degradation of the phenylthiohydantoin-derivative of phosphoserine (37Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorske E. Korte H. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), dual phosphorylation of Ser-19 and Ser-20 would be expected to generate little if any of the corresponding phenylthiohydantoin-derivative. This was not the case; phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives of Ser-19 and Ser-20 were clearly detected upon automated sequencing. Such an observation suggests the existence of two distinct pools of γ-PAK phosphorylated on either Ser-19 or Ser-20. Alternative phosphorylation on adjacent serine residues resulting in a pair of functionally undistinguishable phosphoprotein species has already been reported in the literature (38Hilliard IV, G.M. Cook R.G. Weigel N.L. Pike J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4300-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A summary of the sequencing data is presented in TableI. Autophosphorylation of γ-PAK with MgATP alone takes place at Ser-19, Ser-20, Ser-55, Ser-192, and Ser-197. In the presence of Cdc42, additional autophosphorylation of γ-PAK occurs at Ser-141, Ser-165, and Thr-402. Thus, the latter sites are selectively phosphorylated upon γ-PAK activation. In α-PAK, the phosphorylation of Thr-422, which corresponds to Thr-402 of γ-PAK, has been shown to be critical for the catalytic function of the protein kinase (22Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table ISummary of data from manual and automated sequencing of autophosphorylated γ-PAKSpotWithout Cdc42With Cdc4232P release cycleSite418MSSTIFS18MSSTIFS2/3Ser19/Ser209Trace amount161VSETSAVV5Ser165Trace amount197SVIDPIPA1Ser19710192SIYTR192SIYTR1Ser1921153IISIFS53IISIFS3Ser55Trace amount139YLSFTPPEK3Ser14112197SVIDPI197SVIDPI1Ser19713Trace amount400RSTMVGT3Thr402The cycle at which 32P was released upon manual Edman degradation, the sequence of the respective phosphopeptide, and the phosphorylated residue for each of the assigned spots are indicated with respect to γ-PAK autophosphorylation in the presence or absence of Cdc42(GTPγS).

Open table in a new tab The cycle at which 32P was released upon manual Edman degradation, the sequence of the respective phosphopeptide, and the phosphorylated residue for each of the assigned spots are indicated with respect to γ-PAK autophosphorylation in the presence or absence of Cdc42(GTPγS). The various lengths of the examined sequences are due to differential requirements for unambiguous identification of the phosphopeptides. Due to incomplete tryptic digestion, not all of the32P-labeled spots represent distinct phosphorylation sites. For example, phosphorylated Ser-197 is present both in spots 9 and 12 in the phosphopeptide map from Cdc42-stimulated γ-PAK; the corresponding phosphopeptides have different sizes but share the same N terminus. Accumulation of the smaller phosphopepeptide starting with Ser-197 seems to be dependent on γ-PAK autophosphorylation during activation, given that spot 9 is barely detectable with MgATP alone. In addition, Thr-402, besides being the single phosphorylation site in phosphopeptide 13, is also present in the minor spot 7, as indicated by manual sequencing and by phosphopeptide mapping of the C-terminal fragment resulting from cleavage of γ-PAK by caspase 3 (data not shown). The eight autophosphorylation sites identified in γ-PAK from rabbit have similar positions in rat (5Teo M. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and are thus likely to be autophosphorylated. However, only seven of the sites are present in human γ-PAK, with Ser-165 replaced by proline (7Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). A comparison of the γ-PAK autophosphorylation sites here identified in rabbit with those reported previously for α-PAK from rat shows that six of the sites are conserved (Fig. 9). In α-PAK, Ser-19 is replaced with threonine and has not been identified as a phosphoamino acid (22Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while Ser-165 is replaced by proline. An additional phosphorylated serine is present in α-PAK as Ser-149; this site corresponds to glutamic acid at residue 146 in rabbit, rat, and human γ-PAK (5Teo M. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A.

Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In β-PAK, Ser-19 and Ser-165 are replaced by asparagine and proline, respectively. Thus, Ser-165 is uniquely present in the rabbit and rat isoforms of γ-PAK, while Ser-19 is unique to all forms of γ-PAK. As phosphorylation of the corresponding Thr-20 of α-PAK has not been identified at this time (22Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility exists that such a site is exclusively phosphorylated in γ-PAK. Since phosphorylation of Ser-141 is implicated in the activation of γ-PAK and was detected in α-PAK, it is of interest that the phosphoserine 149 in α-PAK (corresponding to residue 146 in γ-PAK) is already an acidic amino acid in the γ and β isoforms. This suggests that both of these residues may have an important role in PAK activation. We thank Dr. Rolf Jakobi and Barbara Walter for cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant γ-PAK."

DNA-PK contains the heterodimer Ku and a 460-kDa serine/threonine kinase catalytic subunit (p460). Ku binds in vitro to DNA termini or other discontinuities in the DNA helix and is able to enter the DNA molecule by an ATP-independent process. It is clear fromin vitro experiments that Ku stimulates the recruitment to DNA of p460 and activates the kinase activity toward DNA-binding protein substrates in the vicinity. Here, we have examined in human nuclear cell extracts the influence of the kinase catalytic activity on Ku binding to DNA. We demonstrate that, although Ku can enter DNA from free ends in the absence of p460 subunit, the kinase activity is required for Ku translocation along the DNA helix when the whole Ku/p460 assembles on DNA termini. When the kinase activity is impaired, DNA-PK including Ku and p460 is blocked at DNA ends and prevents their processing by either DNA polymerization, degradation, or ligation.

In response to the deleterious consequences associated with DSBs, highly efficient mechanisms have evolved for their recognition and repair. Mammalian cells appear to rejoin DBSs primarily by a mechanism of non-homologous recombination (reviewed in Refs. 1Jeggo P.A. Adv.

Insights into the proteins involved in DBSs break repair have been gained from analysis of the molecular defects in mutant rodent cells that are hypersensitive to IR and unable to carry out the V(D)J recombination process in the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. Recent evidence show that a multiprotein complex, the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) plays a central role in DBS repair in mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 5Jeggo P.A. Mutat.

The DNA-PK is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of a large catalytic subunit of ∼460 kDa (DNA-PKcs, p460), a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p110) family (7Hartley K.O.

Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The unique property of DNA-PK is to exhibit a protein kinase activity that depends on the interaction of the protein complex with DNA. Both DNA-PK subunits can interact with nucleic acids (reviewed in Ref. 10Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The Ku80 and Ku70 proteins form a heterodimer (11Francoeur A.M. Peebles C.L. Heckman K.J. Lee J.C. Tan E.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2378-2384PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol.

Ku is able to translocate along the DNA in an ATP-independent manner, allowing several Ku dimers to bind to a single DNA molecule and form a multimeric complex (15Zhang W.W. Yaneva M. Biochem.

Ku can transfer between DNA fragments with compatible ends (25Bliss T.M. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5765-5773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, Ku bridges DNA ends (26Pang D.L. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. Jung M. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1412-1415PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ramsden D.A. Gellert M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Recently, a direct binding of p460 to DNA leading to kinase activation has been reported under in vitro conditions with purified preparations of the catalytic subunit (28Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 29Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, this property of p460 is lost in the presence of Ku on very short dsDNA fragments <26 bp (29Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For longer DNA, Ku greatly stabilizes the DNA-PK/DNA complex and leads to optimal kinase activity (29Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 30West R.B. Yaneva M. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell.

Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Once bound at DNA termini, the active DNA-PK complex acquires the capacity, at least in vitro, to phosphorylate many DNA-bound proteins in the vicinity (31Anderson C.W. Connelly M.A. Lees-Miller S.P.

For example, DNA-PK phosphorylates many transcription factors including p53 (32Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Ku protein DNA binding properties have been well characterized with purified native or recombinant proteins. However, the question of the influence of the catalytic subunit on Ku interaction with DNA is poorly documented and remains unanswered. DNA-PK complex does not appear to form stably in the absence of DNA (35Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S.A. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6904-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 36Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Once the complex has formed, Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PKcs can be phosphorylated by DNA-PK. DNA-PKcs phosphorylation inactivates the kinase (33Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) that dissociates from Ku (36Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Ku70 binds to DNA in Southwestern analysis (36Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), but whether phosphorylated Ku dimer still binds DNA is not known. It has been shown that the intrinsic Ku DNA-dependent ATPase activity is greatly stimulated when Ku is phosphorylated by DNA-PK (23Cao Q.P. Pitt S. Leszyk J. Baril E.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8548-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but the subsequent possible changes in the association of Ku with DNA have not been determined. On the other hand, extracts from DNA-PKcs-deficient cells exhibit normal DNA end binding activity (37Boubnov N.V. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5700-5706Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 38Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4741-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and mutations in the DNA-PK phosphorylation sites in Ku70 do not modify IR sensitivity in vivo (39Jin S.F. Weaver D.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6874-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The most common assay for Ku DNA end binding activity is electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), but it is performed without ATP, which is a nonpermissive condition for the kinase activity. Moreover, of the two modes of Ku binding to DNA,i.e. DNA end-binding and translocation into the DNA helix, EMSA does not allow precise characterization of the second owing to length limitation of the DNA probe and complexity of the retarded bands pattern. We have examined the possible involvement of DNA-PK catalytic activity on the regulation of Ku binding to DNA in a competition EMSA. The protein extracts were first preincubated with various potential competitor DNAs for Ku DNA binding activity under kinase preventive or permissive conditions; varying the length of linear competitor DNA allowed to take both modes of Ku binding to DNA into account. Then, the free remaining Ku DNA binding activity was assessed with a 25-bp radiolabeled DNA probe under standard EMSA conditions. Nuclear human cell extracts were used in order to closely mimic the physiological conditions of molar ratios of the DNA-PK components and of protein environment. Here, we demonstrate that, although Ku can enter DNA from free double-stranded ends in the absence of p460 subunit, the kinase activity is required for Ku translocation along the DNA helix when the whole Ku/DNA-PKcs assembles on DNA ends. When the kinase activity is impaired, DNA-PK including Ku and DNA-PKcs is blocked at DNA ends and prevents end processing by either DNA polymerization, degradation, or ligation. The HeLa S3 cell line was obtained from the stock of European Molecular Biology Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 125 units/ml penicillin, and 125 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from HeLa cells as described previously (40Shapiro D.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) except that the final dialysis was performed for 3 h at 4 °C in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 17% glycerol, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After preparation, extracts were immediately frozen and stored at −80 °C. The purified Ku complex is baculoviral expressed recombinant proteins purified as already reported (24Cary R.B. Peterson S.R. Wang J.T. Bear D.G. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4267-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Closed circular 2959-bp pBluescript KS+ (pBS, Stratagene) was prepared by the standard alkaline lysis method and cesium chloride gradient centrifugation from Escherichia coli JM109 (relevant genotype: recA1, endA1, gyrA96, hsdR17) followed by two neutral sucrose gradient centrifugations as described (41Biggerstaff M. Robins P. Coverley D. Wood R.D. Mutat. Res. 1991; 254: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When necessary, pBS plasmid was linearized by digestion at a unique site with HindIII. End radiolabeled pBS was produced by incubation of linearized pBS withE. coli Klenow fragment (0.02 unit) (Life Technologies, Inc.) together with 5 μm dNTP and 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by chromatography through Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and phenol/chloroform extraction. The 173- and 710-bp fragments were prepared by digestion with bothEcoRI and HindIII of pGf1 and pCMV plasmids, respectively (Ref. 42Satoh M.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3576-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar; kind gifts of Dr M. S. Satoh, Université Laval, Quebec, Canada), and a mean 1400-bp length fragment was obtained by digestion of pBS with BglI producing two fragments (1691 and 1268 bp). The bands corresponding to the fragments were excised from agarose gel, and the DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. A radiolabeled double-stranded 25-mer DNA probe was prepared according to Han et al. (43Han Z. Johnston C. Reeves W.H. Carter T. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14098-14104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The two oligonucleotides (5′-ACTTGATTAGTTACGTAACGTTATG-3′ and 5′-CATAACGTTACGTAACTAATCAAGT-3′) were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and subsequently annealed together. The probes were purified by chromatography through Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EMSA was performed as described previously (15Zhang W.W. Yaneva M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled DNA (4 ng, 100,000 cpm) was incubated with nuclear extracts (2 μg) in 10 μl of buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.3 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol) in the presence of closed circular pBS plasmid as a nonspecific competitor (0.5 μg) at 30 °C for 15 min. The samples were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C, for 2 h at 100 V. The gel was dried on Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to a storage phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics), followed by processing with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Storm SystemTM). The regions of the gel containing the free probe and the retardation complexes were quantitated by the ImageQuant software, version 4.2A (Molecular Dynamics). In the supershift experiments, antibodies were added to the mixture following the binding incubation and the mixture was incubated for an additional 5 min prior to gel electrophoresis. The antibodies used were purified on protein A-Sepharose from human autoimmune antiserum AF (a generous gift from Dr. E. M. Tan, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), which recognizes Ku70 and Ku80 (11Francoeur A.M. Peebles C.L. Heckman K.J. Lee J.C. Tan E.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2378-2384PubMed Google Scholar) and, as a control, from the human serum Sa that contains anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies (provided by Dr. Y. Takeda, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA). Nuclear protein extracts (20 μg) or purified Ku protein as indicated in 10 μl of buffer (45 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 40 mm phosphocreatine, 2.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase (type I, Sigma), 3.4% glycerol, and 18 μg of bovine serum albumin) were first preincubated in the presence of closed circular pBS plasmid as a nonspecific competitor (1 μg). When necessary, ATP (from 1 m stock solution in water, potassium salt; Sigma) and wortmannin (from 10 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide; Sigma) were included in the mixture. When indicated, linear DNA was included in the mixture before the preincubation (sample thereafter named + competitor linear DNA) and in some experiments, an equivalent amount of closed circular pBS was added in control reactions (sample named − competitor linear DNA). After 1 h at 30 °C, 1/10 of the reaction mixture (1 μl, equivalent to 2 μg of protein extracts) was incubated in a 10-μl final reaction volume with the radiolabeled 25-mer DNA probe for 10 min at 30 °C under standard EMSA conditions as described above. The samples were electrophoresed and the gel processed as described above. Anti-DNA-PKcs mouse monoclonal antibody mAb 25–4 (kind gift of Dr. T. Carter, Dept. of Biological Sciences, St. John's University, Jamaica, NY) was reported previously (44Carter T.H. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The mAb in hybridoma supernatant was coupled to magnetic anti-mouse IgG beads (Dynabeads M-450, Dynal), according to the manufacturer recommendations. Under a 20-μl final volume, 250 μg of HeLa nuclear protein extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with 20 μl of wet anti-DNAPK beads (equivalent to ≈2 μg of anti-DNA-PK IgG) in extract dialysis buffer under gentle agitation. The supernatant was removed over a magnet (Dynal MPC, Dynal). A second depletion was performed immediately under the same conditions. An aliquot of the supernatant was assayed for DNA-PK activity and reached <10% of the initial activity as reported (45Muller C. Calsou P. Frit P. Cayrol C. Carter T. Salles B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1382-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As control, immunodepletions were run in parallel with uncoupled anti-mouse IgG beads (extracts thereafter referred to as mock-treated) or with beads coupled to anti-XPB mouse monoclonal antibody mAb 1B3 (kind gift from Dr. J. M. Egly, IGBMC, Illkirch, France). Nuclear protein extracts (20 μg) were incubated in a 10-μl volume reaction under competition EMSA preincubation conditions (see above) in the presence of 50 ng of end-radiolabeled HindIII-linearized pBS, with 5 μm ATP and with or without 3 μm wortmannin. After 60 min at 30 °C, an excess of unlabeled 25-bp dsDNA probe (2.5 pmol) was added to the mixture. This amount was estimated from EMSA experiments to be sufficient to titrate out any Ku that would not have bound linear pBS during the preincubation period (data not shown; see Fig. 5). Then, half of the reaction (5 μl) was incubated in a 20-μl final reaction volume with SacI enzyme (20 units, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in restriction buffer according to the manufacturer. After 60 min at 37 °C, 1/4 of the reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with 10 μl of wet anti-DNAPK (mAb 25.4) or control anti-IgG magnetic beads under gentle agitation. Then, the supernatant was removed, the beads were washed twice with 500 μl of buffer (6 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 12 mm KCl, 2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol) and resuspended in 15 μl of the same buffer. DNA fragments in both beads and supernatant fractions were purified by 60 min incubation at 37 °C with 0.5% SDS and proteinase K (200 μg/ml final concentration) followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C, for 2 h at 100 V. Nuclear protein extracts (20 μg) were incubated in a 10-μl volume reaction under competition EMSA preincubation conditions (see above) in the presence of 50 ng of end-radiolabeled HindIII-linearized pBS, with 5 μm ATP and with or without 3 μm wortmannin as indicated. After 60 min at 30 °C, 1/3 of the reaction mixture was further incubated with E. coli exonuclease III (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15 min at 37 °C. Reaction was terminated by addition of 10 mm EDTA and 0.5% SDS. The DNA was recovered from the reaction mixture by proteinase K digestion (200 μg/ml, 15 min at 37 °C), followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and then separated on TAE-0.8% agarose gels. After visualization under short wavelength UV light, the gel was dried and radioactive DNA was revealed by exposure to a storage phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics) followed by processing with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Storm SystemTM). This assay follows the same procedure as described above except that the HindIII-linearized plasmid pBS substrate was unlabeled, and the exo III enzyme was replaced byE. coli Klenow fragment (0.02 unit) (Life Technologies, Inc.) together with 5 μm dNTP and 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). DNA was purified as above. The radioactivity incorporation due to the overhang fill-in was visualized by exposure to a storage phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics) followed by processing with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Storm SystemTM). Nuclear protein extract (40 μg) was incubated under conditions as described above but with the following modifications: 200 ng of unlabeled HindIII-linearized pBS plasmid without competitor DNA, 1 mm ATP, and with or without 30 μm wortmannin as indicated, for 60 min at 37 °C. DNA was purified as above. The ligation products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Ku DNA binding activity can be easily detected by using dsDNA fragments in an EMSA (15Zhang W.W. Yaneva M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). When a 25-bp labeled DNA was mixed with nuclear extracts from HeLa cells, a single slow migrating band appeared in the gel (Fig.1 A). This band was supershifted in the presence of antibodies purified from a human serum able to recognize both Ku subunits, while the control antiserum (that contained anti-ribonucleoprotein autoantibodies) had no effect. Thus, this retarded band can be confidently ascribed to a Ku DNA complex. Under these standard EMSA conditions, Ku binds to the DNA probe independently from the p460 subunit since it has been demonstrated that a stable Ku-p460 complex fails to form on short fragments (<26 bp) (28Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 29Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 30West R.B. Yaneva M. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and, moreover, that Ku competes for p460 binding to such short DNA probes (29Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 30West R.B. Yaneva M. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have tentatively analyzed the co-binding of Ku and p460 on probes >100 bp under standard EMSA conditions (data not shown). However, the appearance of multiple retarded bands including material in the wells of the gel prevents a precise analysis of the protein-DNA complexes involved. Since the EMSA is performed in the presence of excess supercoiled plasmid DNA, which competes for unspecific DNA binding activity in the extracts, we reasoned that it might be possible to characterize a potential p460-dependent Ku DNA binding activity by preincubating the extracts with unlabeled linear plasmid DNA allowing the co-binding of both DNA-PK subunits. For this purpose, nuclear protein extracts were suitable since, as already observed (33Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar,44Carter T.H. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we found that p460 was concentrated in the nucleus and hardly detectable in the corresponding cytoplasmic extracts (data not shown). Indeed, only the nuclear fraction exhibited a significant DNA-PK activity as measured by the conventional pull-down assay on DNA-cellulose beads in the presence of a peptide kinase substrate (46Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In addition, since the molar ratio of both DNA-PK components may be important for interaction with DNA, nuclear extracts were preferred over whole cell extracts, since in the latter, cytoplasmic Ku may change the physiologic molar ratio of Ku toward p460 in the nucleus. Thus, we performed a new EMSA (referred to as competition EMSA under “Experimental Procedures”) in which nuclear cell extracts were preincubated with or without linear plasmid DNA, in the presence or absence of ATP. Then, the remaining Ku binding activity was assessed on the labeled 25-bp probe that allows to visualize the DNA binding activity specifically devoted to the Ku subunit of DNA-PK independently from p460 (Fig. 1 B). Although under these conditions, 10 ng of linear plasmid slightly competed for Ku (>95% remaining binding to the probe), ATP dramatically increased this effect (<20% remaining binding to the probe). A preincubation in the presence of ATP but with only the standard supercoiled competitor DNA had no competitor effect (Fig. 1 B, lanes −linear DNA). The stimulating effect of ATP on the Ku titration by linear DNA was detected all over a range of DNA concentration (Fig.1 C) yielding 10-fold for 100 ng of DNA (7% and 65% remaining binding to the probe in the presence and absence of ATP, respectively). A concentration of ATP down to 1 μm in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system was sufficient to promote a significant stimulation of Ku titration (data not shown). It has been reported that Ku dimer could exhibit DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent helicase activities (19Ochem A.E. Skopac D. Costa M. Rabilloud T. Vuillard L. Simoncsits A. Giacca M.

https://openalex.org/W2103100606,"Insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinedione (TZD) compounds are high affinity ligands for a member of the nuclear receptor family, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ. A scintillation proximity assay for measurement of3H-radiolabeled TZD binding to human PPARγ under homogeneous conditions was developed. Using this approach, a novel non-TZD compound (L-764406) was shown to be a potent (apparent binding IC50 of 70 nm) PPARγ ligand. Preincubation of PPARγ with L-764406 prevented binding of the [3H]TZD, suggesting a covalent interaction with the receptor; in addition, structurally related analogues ofL-764406, which would be predicted not to interact with PPARγ in a covalent fashion, did not displace [3H]TZD binding to PPARγ. Covalent binding of L-764406 was proven by an observed molecular weight shift of a tryptic PPARγ ligand binding domain (LBD) peptide by mass spectrometric analysis. A specific cysteine residue (Cys313 in helix 3 of hPPARγ2) was identified as the attachment site for this compound. In protease protection experiments, the liganded receptor adopted a typical agonist conformation. L-764406 exhibited partial agonist activity in cells expressing a chimeric receptor containing the PPARγ LBD and a cognate reporter gene and also induced the expression of the adipocyte-specific gene aP2 in 3T3-L1 cells. In contrast,L-764406 did not exhibit activity in cells transfected with chimeric receptors containing PPARα or PPARδ LBDs. The partial agonist properties of L-764406 were also evident in a co-activator association assay, indicating that the increased transcription in cells was co-activator mediated. Thus,L-764406 is a novel non-TZD ligand for PPARγ and is also the first known partial agonist for this receptor. The results suggest a critical functional role for Cys313, and helix 3, in contributing to ligand binding and subsequent agonist-induced conformational changes.

They are currently divided into three subtypes: PPARα, PPARδ (also known as hNUC1 or PPARβ), and PPARγ, with each being encoded by a distinct gene. The presence of at least two promoters in the 5′-flanking region of PPARγ results in the production of two isoforms, γ1 and γ2 (3Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D. Sambasiva R.M. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), where γ2 possesses an additional 30 residues at its amino terminus (4Elbrecht A. Chen Y. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N. Leibowitz M.D. Moller D.E. Berger J. Bichem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Like other members of this superfamily, the PPARs exert their effects by regulating gene transcription and all three members bind to DR1 response elements (reviewed in Ref. 1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6027) Google Scholar).Although the three subtypes have been grouped together based on sequence homology, it is clear that they have distinct functions. PPARα is expressed predominantly in the liver and is involved in peroxisome proliferation and regulation of fatty acid catabolism (5Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar). PPARγ plays a pivotal role in fat cell differentiation and lipid storage (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3092) Google Scholar), while PPARδ is expressed in most cell types but its role remains unclear (7Schmidt A. Endo N. Rutledge S.J. Vogel R. Shinar D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1634-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Consistent with their distinct physiological roles, each receptor has been shown to bind a discrete set of ligands, although, in general, these receptors seem to be regulated by fatty acids and eicosanoids (8Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar, 9Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, for PPARα, selected fatty acids serve as potential natural ligands; in addition, the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs and a group of structurally diverse peroxisome proliferators can also function as PPARα ligands and/or activators. The synthetic thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizers (11Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol.

Rutledge S.J. Vogel R. Shinar D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1634-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 9Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar).These receptors play a central role in lipid homeostasis where imbalances can lead to cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Indeed, medications targeted to PPARs have been demonstrated to be effective treatments for hyperlipidemia (fibrates, Ref. 14Larsen M.L. Illingworth D.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 34-40Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and insulin resistance (thiazolidinediones, Ref. 15Nolan J.J. Ludvik B. Beersden M.J. Olefsky J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Thus, there has been considerable interest in developing new and specific ligands for these receptors (16Brown P.J. Smith-Oliver T.A. Charifson P.S. Tomkinson N.C.O. Fivush A.M. Sternbach D.D. Wade L.E. Orband-Miller L. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Kliewer S.A. Lehamann J.M. Willson T.M. Chem.

It is, therefore, clear that further characterization of the spectrum of natural or synthetic molecules, which can function as PPAR ligands and agonists is an important undertaking. Moreover, a determination of the precise residues in the PPAR ligand binding domains (LBDs), which make contact with agonist ligands would greatly facilitate the subsequent discovery of new and therapeutically useful modulators of these receptors.Here, we used a radiolabeled thiazolidinedione and recombinant human PPARγ to develop a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) in order to characterize ligands that bind this receptor. Using this approach, a novel non-TZD compound, L-764406, was shown to be a high affinity PPARγ ligand. Several approaches were used to demonstrate that this compound acts as a specific agonist for PPARγ. Importantly,L-764406 was also shown to bind covalently to PPARγ. This phenomenon was exploited in order to determine that the compound bound directly to Cys313 in helix 3 of the LBD of human PPARγ2. The identification of Cys313 as the attachment site forL-764406 defines an important role for this residue and for helix 3 in ligand binding and activation of PPARγ.DISCUSSIONWe developed a novel SPA-based binding assay for the nuclear receptor, PPARγ. This is a simple assay that does not require separation of bound and free radiolabeled ligands. Using this approach,L-764406 was shown to function as a potent ligand for hPPARγ. Based upon the chemical structure of this compound, we suspected that it might bind covalently to the PPARγ LBD. This concept was also suggested by the observation that three closely related analogue compounds lacking the chlorine found inL-764406 were inactive in the PPARγ SPA binding assay. Experimental evidence in favor of this hypothesis includes the fact that preincubation of PPARγ with this compound abrogated the ability of a potent TZD ligand to displace L-764406 binding. Moreover, covalent binding of L-764406 to PPARγ was definitively proven by mass spectral analysis of PPARγ LBD incubated with this compound; a molecular mass increase in one peptide fragment was detected, which corresponded precisely to the molecular weight ofL-764406, minus 35 Da for the loss of chlorine.Although L-764406 completely displaced [3H]TZD at concentrations greater than 1 μm, it was only capable of producing partial agonist activity at these concentrations when its ability to induce PPARγ-mediated gene transcription was assessed. This was noted using either GAL4/hPPARγ chimeric receptors in COS-1 cells or in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes where wild type murine receptors are present and can serve to induce aP2 expression. In both cases, only 25% of the maximal activity obtained with a TZD was observed. This partial agonist profile is unique for a PPARγ ligand, since other known ligands including several thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizers (11Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O.

McDonnellet al. (25McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that the estrogen receptor can assume conformations distinct from those of the normal ligand-bound receptor when bound to ligands with varying agonist activities. Their studies also demonstrate that these activities are dependent on cellular and promoter contexts; thus, it is possible thatL-764406 might behave as a full agonist under different experimental conditions. In protease protection experiments,L-764406 produced a trypsin digestion profile that was indistinguishable from the thiazolidinedione agonist BRL49653. Although estrogen receptor antagonists are known to produce a distinct protease protection pattern from that of 17β-estradiol (20Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that possible conformational differences responsible for the partial agonist activity of L-764406 may be too subtle for detection by the protease protection assays performed here.The agonist activity of L-764406 is apparently specific for PPARγ, since no activity was noted with GAL4 chimeric receptors containing either PPARα or PPARδ LBDs. A multiple sequence alignment of the LBDs for hPPARγ, hPPARα, and hPPARδ (Fig. 6) shows that the single cysteine in PPARγ (Cys313) is conserved in the other two receptors. Although PPARγ has only one cysteine in the LBD, the PPARα LBD contains two additional cysteine residues flanking the conserved cysteine, with one of these additional cysteines also being present in PPARδ. Thus, despite the availability of potential attachment sites in the LBDs of hPPARα and hPPARδ,L-764406 does not activate these receptors (Fig. 5).Cys313 in the LBD of PPARγ is within a predicted helical domain 2The predicted helical domains within the LBD were determined using the GCG (version 9.1) sequence analysis package. that corresponds to helix 3 as previously diagrammed in the crystal structures of the RARγ (26Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) and ERα (27Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar) LBDs. Importantly, residues within helix 3 of the ERα LBD have been shown to interact with the A-ring of 17β-estradiol (28Ekena K. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), as well as the ER antagonist raloxifene (27Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). The specific residues of the ERα LBD that interact with 17β-estradiol include Leu345, Thr345, and Glu353and are not conserved in hPPARγ. Although a homologous cysteine has not been identified in the estrogen receptors, a cysteine corresponding to Cys313 is conserved in the LBDs of human RXRα, -β, and -γ, but not in RARα, -β, and -γ. In addition to providing contacts with its ligand, all-trans-retanoic acid, helix 3 from the LBD of RARγ forms intramolecular interactions with helix 12 and thus may be involved in the orientation of the AF-2 domain (26Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). This relationship suggests a pathway whereby ligand interactions at helix 3 are translated into interactions with co-activators through the AF-2 domain. Indeed, we have shown that the partial agonistL-764406 exhibits a diminished interaction with CBP (Fig.10). Since this interaction could not be augmented by subsequent addition of a more potent agonist, TZD (Fig. 10), it suggests that despite the relatively small size of L-764406, the modified Cys313 disrupts the ligand binding pocket sufficiently to prevent activation by TZD. We know that Cys313 is not an absolute requirement for TZD binding since the C313A mutation is still active in this regard, albeit at a dramatically reduced level. Together these experiments suggest that the activity of L-764406 as a partial agonist is mediated by a limited (versus full agonists) interaction with co-activators. However, it should be noted that although L-764406 functions as a partial agonist in the cell-based transactivation assays (Figs. 8 and 9) and in the in vitro co-activator association assay (Fig. 10), it is possible that this compound could function as a full agonist in another context.Although RARs do not posses a cysteine residue homologous to the one found in the LBD of PPARγ, RARα does have a serine residue at this position. In fact, the replacement of Ala225 for Ser232 is the only difference between the LBDs of RARβ and RARα and has been shown to account for their ligand specificity (26Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). This shows that the residue at this position in helix 3 is involved in the determination of ligand specificity for other nuclear receptors.Since the completion of our studies, Nolte et al. (29Nolte R.T. Wisely R.G. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar) reported their results where x-ray crystallography was used to determine the PPARγ LBD structure. Their findings indicate that Cys313 is indeed located within helix 3 and that helix 3 forms an important component of the ligand binding pocket when occupied by the TZD, BRL49653. Flanking Cys313 are two residues, Phe310 and Gln314, which form part of a hydrophobic pocket occupied by the sulfur atom of the TZD ring in BRL49653 (29Nolte R.T. Wisely R.G. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Cys313 is believed to form part of a narrow pocket occupied by the central benzene ring of BRL49653 (29Nolte R.T. Wisely R.G. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Our results obtained using a novel covalent ligand provide an independent line of evidence which shows the involvement of helix 3, and in our case, Cys313, in forming critical components of the PPARγ ligand binding pocket.In summary, L-764406 was shown to possess agonist activity in cells and produced an LBD protease protection pattern that was similar to that caused by a known TZD; thus, it is likely that the interaction of ligands with helix 3 (and Cys313) is important for the induction of conformational changes which mediate co-activator recruitment and activation of transcription.L-764406 is also unique among known PPARγ ligands in that it functions as a partial agonist (in co-activator association, transactivation, and adipogenesis). This finding supports the notion that PPARγ ligands, which might exhibit more restricted (tissue- or even gene-specific) effects, and hence different therapeutic or toxicity profiles, await discovery. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)1are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M.

Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). They are currently divided into three subtypes: PPARα, PPARδ (also known as hNUC1 or PPARβ), and PPARγ, with each being encoded by a distinct gene. The presence of at least two promoters in the 5′-flanking region of PPARγ results in the production of two isoforms, γ1 and γ2 (3Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D. Sambasiva R.M. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), where γ2 possesses an additional 30 residues at its amino terminus (4Elbrecht A. Chen Y. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N. Leibowitz M.D. Moller D.E. Berger J. Bichem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Like other members of this superfamily, the PPARs exert their effects by regulating gene transcription and all three members bind to DR1 response elements (reviewed in Ref. 1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6027) Google Scholar). Although the three subtypes have been grouped together based on sequence homology, it is clear that they have distinct functions. PPARα is expressed predominantly in the liver and is involved in peroxisome proliferation and regulation of fatty acid catabolism (5Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar). PPARγ plays a pivotal role in fat cell differentiation and lipid storage (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3092) Google Scholar), while PPARδ is expressed in most cell types but its role remains unclear (7Schmidt A. Endo N. Rutledge S.J. Vogel R. Shinar D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1634-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Consistent with their distinct physiological roles, each receptor has been shown to bind a discrete set of ligands, although, in general, these receptors seem to be regulated by fatty acids and eicosanoids (8Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar, 9Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, for PPARα, selected fatty acids serve as potential natural ligands; in addition, the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs and a group of structurally diverse peroxisome proliferators can also function as PPARα ligands and/or activators. The synthetic thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizers (11Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol.

Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar), while several polyunsaturated fatty acids and eicosanoids can serve to activate PPARδ (7Schmidt A. Endo N. Rutledge S.J. Vogel R. Shinar D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1634-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 9Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). These receptors play a central role in lipid homeostasis where imbalances can lead to cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Indeed, medications targeted to PPARs have been demonstrated to be effective treatments for hyperlipidemia (fibrates, Ref. 14Larsen M.L. Illingworth D.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 34-40Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and insulin resistance (thiazolidinediones, Ref. 15Nolan J.J. Ludvik B. Beersden M.J. Olefsky J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Thus, there has been considerable interest in developing new and specific ligands for these receptors (16Brown P.J. Smith-Oliver T.A. Charifson P.S. Tomkinson N.C.O. Fivush A.M. Sternbach D.D. Wade L.E. Orband-Miller L. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Kliewer S.A. Lehamann J.M. Willson T.M. Chem.

Rea T.J. Newton R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 17-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is, therefore, clear that further characterization of the spectrum of natural or synthetic molecules, which can function as PPAR ligands and agonists is an important undertaking. Moreover, a determination of the precise residues in the PPAR ligand binding domains (LBDs), which make contact with agonist ligands would greatly facilitate the subsequent discovery of new and therapeutically useful modulators of these receptors. Here, we used a radiolabeled thiazolidinedione and recombinant human PPARγ to develop a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) in order to characterize ligands that bind this receptor. Using this approach, a novel non-TZD compound, L-764406, was shown to be a high affinity PPARγ ligand. Several approaches were used to demonstrate that this compound acts as a specific agonist for PPARγ. Importantly,L-764406 was also shown to bind covalently to PPARγ. This phenomenon was exploited in order to determine that the compound bound directly to Cys313 in helix 3 of the LBD of human PPARγ2. The identification of Cys313 as the attachment site forL-764406 defines an important role for this residue and for helix 3 in ligand binding and activation of PPARγ. DISCUSSIONWe developed a novel SPA-based binding assay for the nuclear receptor, PPARγ. This is a simple assay that does not require separation of bound and free radiolabeled ligands. Using this approach,L-764406 was shown to function as a potent ligand for hPPARγ. Based upon the chemical structure of this compound, we suspected that it might bind covalently to the PPARγ LBD. This concept was also suggested by the observation that three closely related analogue compounds lacking the chlorine found inL-764406 were inactive in the PPARγ SPA binding assay. Experimental evidence in favor of this hypothesis includes the fact that preincubation of PPARγ with this compound abrogated the ability of a potent TZD ligand to displace L-764406 binding. Moreover, covalent binding of L-764406 to PPARγ was definitively proven by mass spectral analysis of PPARγ LBD incubated with this compound; a molecular mass increase in one peptide fragment was detected, which corresponded precisely to the molecular weight ofL-764406, minus 35 Da for the loss of chlorine.Although L-764406 completely displaced [3H]TZD at concentrations greater than 1 μm, it was only capable of producing partial agonist activity at these concentrations when its ability to induce PPARγ-mediated gene transcription was assessed. This was noted using either GAL4/hPPARγ chimeric receptors in COS-1 cells or in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes where wild type murine receptors are present and can serve to induce aP2 expression. In both cases, only 25% of the maximal activity obtained with a TZD was observed. This partial agonist profile is unique for a PPARγ ligand, since other known ligands including several thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizers (11Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O.

McDonnellet al. (25McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that the estrogen receptor can assume conformations distinct from those of the normal ligand-bound receptor when bound to ligands with varying agonist activities.

In protease protection experiments,L-764406 produced a trypsin digestion profile that was indistinguishable from the thiazolidinedione agonist BRL49653.

A multiple sequence alignment of the LBDs for hPPARγ, hPPARα, and hPPARδ (Fig. 6) shows that the single cysteine in PPARγ (Cys313) is conserved in the other two receptors. Although PPARγ has only one cysteine in the LBD, the PPARα LBD contains two additional cysteine residues flanking the conserved cysteine, with one of these additional cysteines also being present in PPARδ.

The specific residues of the ERα LBD that interact with 17β-estradiol include Leu345, Thr345, and Glu353and are not conserved in hPPARγ.

Experimental evidence in favor of this hypothesis includes the fact that preincubation of PPARγ with this compound abrogated the ability of a potent TZD ligand to displace L-764406 binding. Moreover, covalent binding of L-764406 to PPARγ was definitively proven by mass spectral analysis of PPARγ LBD incubated with this compound; a molecular mass increase in one peptide fragment was detected, which corresponded precisely to the molecular weight ofL-764406, minus 35 Da for the loss of chlorine. Although L-764406 completely displaced [3H]TZD at concentrations greater than 1 μm, it was only capable of producing partial agonist activity at these concentrations when its ability to induce PPARγ-mediated gene transcription was assessed. This was noted using either GAL4/hPPARγ chimeric receptors in COS-1 cells or in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes where wild type murine receptors are present and can serve to induce aP2 expression. In both cases, only 25% of the maximal activity obtained with a TZD was observed. This partial agonist profile is unique for a PPARγ ligand, since other known ligands including several thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizers (11Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O.

Although the molecular basis for partial agonist activity is not well understood, it could be due to the production of a receptor conformation with a reduced affinity for co-activators. McDonnellet al. (25McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that the estrogen receptor can assume conformations distinct from those of the normal ligand-bound receptor when bound to ligands with varying agonist activities. Their studies also demonstrate that these activities are dependent on cellular and promoter contexts; thus, it is possible thatL-764406 might behave as a full agonist under different experimental conditions. In protease protection experiments,L-764406 produced a trypsin digestion profile that was indistinguishable from the thiazolidinedione agonist BRL49653. Although estrogen receptor antagonists are known to produce a distinct protease protection pattern from that of 17β-estradiol (20Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that possible conformational differences responsible for the partial agonist activity of L-764406 may be too subtle for detection by the protease protection assays performed here. The agonist activity of L-764406 is apparently specific for PPARγ, since no activity was noted with GAL4 chimeric receptors containing either PPARα or PPARδ LBDs. A multiple sequence alignment of the LBDs for hPPARγ, hPPARα, and hPPARδ (Fig. 6) shows that the single cysteine in PPARγ (Cys313) is conserved in the other two receptors. Although PPARγ has only one cysteine in the LBD, the PPARα LBD contains two additional cysteine residues flanking the conserved cysteine, with one of these additional cysteines also being present in PPARδ. Thus, despite the availability of potential attachment sites in the LBDs of hPPARα and hPPARδ,L-764406 does not activate these receptors (Fig. 5). Cys313 in the LBD of PPARγ is within a predicted helical domain 2The predicted helical domains within the LBD were determined using the GCG (version 9.1) sequence analysis package. that corresponds to helix 3 as previously diagrammed in the crystal structures of the RARγ (26Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) and ERα (27Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar) LBDs. Importantly, residues within helix 3 of the ERα LBD have been shown to interact with the A-ring of 17β-estradiol (28Ekena K. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), as well as the ER antagonist raloxifene (27Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). The specific residues of the ERα LBD that interact with 17β-estradiol include Leu345, Thr345, and Glu353and are not conserved in hPPARγ. Although a homologous cysteine has not been identified in the estrogen receptors, a cysteine corresponding to Cys313 is conserved in the LBDs of human RXRα, -β, and -γ, but not in RARα, -β, and -γ. In addition to providing contacts with its ligand, all-trans-retanoic acid, helix 3 from the LBD of RARγ forms intramolecular interactions with helix 12 and thus may be involved in the orientation of the AF-2 domain (26Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). This relationship suggests a pathway whereby ligand interactions at helix 3 are translated into interactions with co-activators through the AF-2 domain. Indeed, we have shown that the partial agonistL-764406 exhibits a diminished interaction with CBP (Fig.10). Since this interaction could not be augmented by subsequent addition of a more potent agonist, TZD (Fig. 10), it suggests that despite the relatively small size of L-764406, the modified Cys313 disrupts the ligand binding pocket sufficiently to prevent activation by TZD. We know that Cys313 is not an absolute requirement for TZD binding since the C313A mutation is still active in this regard, albeit at a dramatically reduced level. Together these experiments suggest that the activity of L-764406 as a partial agonist is mediated by a limited (versus full agonists) interaction with co-activators. However, it should be noted that although L-764406 functions as a partial agonist in the cell-based transactivation assays (Figs. 8 and 9) and in the in vitro co-activator association assay (Fig. 10), it is possible that this compound could function as a full agonist in another context. Although RARs do not posses a cysteine residue homologous to the one found in the LBD of PPARγ, RARα does have a serine residue at this position. In fact, the replacement of Ala225 for Ser232 is the only difference between the LBDs of RARβ and RARα and has been shown to account for their ligand specificity (26Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). This shows that the residue at this position in helix 3 is involved in the determination of ligand specificity for other nuclear receptors. Since the completion of our studies, Nolte et al. (29Nolte R.T. Wisely R.G. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar) reported their results where x-ray crystallography was used to determine the PPARγ LBD structure. Their findings indicate that Cys313 is indeed located within helix 3 and that helix 3 forms an important component of the ligand binding pocket when occupied by the TZD, BRL49653. Flanking Cys313 are two residues, Phe310 and Gln314, which form part of a hydrophobic pocket occupied by the sulfur atom of the TZD ring in BRL49653 (29Nolte R.T. Wisely R.G. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Cys313 is believed to form part of a narrow pocket occupied by the central benzene ring of BRL49653 (29Nolte R.T. Wisely R.G. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Our results obtained using a novel covalent ligand provide an independent line of evidence which shows the involvement of helix 3, and in our case, Cys313, in forming critical components of the PPARγ ligand binding pocket. In summary, L-764406 was shown to possess agonist activity in cells and produced an LBD protease protection pattern that was similar to that caused by a known TZD; thus, it is likely that the interaction of ligands with helix 3 (and Cys313) is important for the induction of conformational changes which mediate co-activator recruitment and activation of transcription.L-764406 is also unique among known PPARγ ligands in that it functions as a partial agonist (in co-activator association, transactivation, and adipogenesis). This finding supports the notion that PPARγ ligands, which might exhibit more restricted (tissue- or even gene-specific) effects, and hence different therapeutic or toxicity profiles, await discovery.

https://openalex.org/W2087674929,"DP5, which contains a BH3 domain, was cloned as a neuronal apoptosis-inducing gene. To confirm that DP5 interacts with members of the Bcl-2 family, 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with DP5 and Bcl-xl cDNA constructs, and immunoprecipitation was carried out. The 30-kDa Bcl-xl was co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged DP5, suggesting that DP5 physically interacts with Bcl-xl in mammalian cells. Previously, we reported that DP5 is induced during neuronal apoptosis in cultured sympathetic neurons. Here, we analyzed DP5 gene expression and the specific interaction of DP5 with Bcl-xl during neuronal death induced by amyloid-β protein (A β). DP5 mRNA was induced 6 h after treatment with A β in cultured rat cortical neurons. The protein encoded by DP5 mRNA showed a specific interaction with Bcl-xl. Induction of DP5 gene expression was blocked by nifedipine, an inhibitor of l-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, and dantrolene, an inhibitor of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. These results suggested that the induction of DP5 mRNA occurs downstream of the increase in cytosolic calcium concentration caused by A β. Moreover, DP5 specifically interacts with Bcl-xl during neuronal apoptosis following exposure to A β, and its binding could impair the survival-promoting activities of Bcl-xl. Thus, the induction of DP5 mRNA and the interaction of DP5 and Bcl-xl could play significant roles in neuronal degeneration following exposure to A β.

However, the molecular events or cascades underlying neuronal death regulated by the genetic program still remain unclear. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal death could contribute to understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we isolated a novel gene named DP5 that is induced during neuronal apoptosis using rat sympathetic neurons in culture deprived of NGF (1Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Imai Y. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18842-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).1 This gene has the following unique features: 1) the encoded protein has a BH3 domain, which is essential for interaction with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, and a transmembrane region at its C-terminal; 2) its expression shows marked induction with peak levels at 15 h after NGF withdrawal, concurrent with the time at which neurons are committed to die in the sympathetic culture model; and 3) overexpression of full-length DP5 in cultured neurons was sufficient to induce apoptosis. In the developing murine nervous system, DP5 mRNA was localized in several tissues such as the trigeminal and dosal root ganglia and the anterior horn of the spinal cord, which are known to contain a number of apoptotic cells in the mouse embryo. These observations suggested that DP5 could be associated with the phenomena of neuronal death in vivo(2Kanazawa K. Imaizumi K. Mori T. Honma Y. Tojyo M. Tanno Y. Yokoya S. Tohyama M. Takagi T. Wanaka A. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, Inohara et al. (3Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) cloned the human gene Harakiri (Hrk), which physically interacts with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. The polypeptide encoded by Hrk has a BH3 domain and transmembrane region and is highly homologous with DP5 (72% identity), suggesting that DP5 and Hrk are homologues from different species.

However, these proteins do not show any significant amino acid homology beyond the conserved BH3 domain.

Morphologically, this type of neuronal death shows hallmarks of apoptosis including cellular shrinkage, blebbing of the plasma membrane, nuclear condensation, and nucleosomal fragmentation (13Loo D.T.

To gain insight into the neuronal responses to A β at the molecular level, analyses of the effects of A β treatment on neuronal gene expression in vitro have been carried out (16Estus S. Tucker H.M. Rooyen C.V. Wright S. Brigham E.F. Wogulis M. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7736-7745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some gene expression patterns induced by A β treatment were markedly similar to those of sympathetic neurons deprived of NGF, suggesting that a genetic cascade is necessary for neuronal death following exposure to A β similarly to NGF-deprived neuronal death. In the present study, we determined whether DP5 gene expression was closely associated with the process of neuronal apoptosis induced by A β in addition to sympathetic neuronal death as reported previously (1Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Imai Y. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18842-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the changes in binding between DP5 and the death repressor protein Bcl-xl were also examined in the culture model. We report here that DP5 mRNA expression was induced and the encoded protein interacted specifically with Bcl-xl during neuronal death following exposure to A β. Our in vitro results suggested that DP5 may have an important role in neuronal apoptosis induced by treatment with A β and in the neuronal loss associated with Alzheimer's disease. Primary cultures of neuronal cells were prepared from the cortex of fetal rats at 18 days of gestation. The dissected tissues were treated with papain (Sigma), 0.02% dl-cysteine-HCl, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% glucose, and 0.1% DNase to dissociate the cells. Aliquots of 1×107 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes coated with poly-l-lysine and maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. On the next day, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing B27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.) in place of fetal calf serum, and culture was maintained for 5 days before A β stimulation. A β25–35, A β1–40, and A β40–1 (Bachem) stock solutions were prepared as 1-mm stocks in sterile distilled water. Cultured rat primary neurons were exposed to A β by the culture medium replacing with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/B27 containing 20 or 40 μm A β. The numbers of living cells were counted based on morphological criteria and trypan blue staining at various time points after treatment with A β. Aliquots of 3 μg of total RNA purified from preplated cortical neuron cultures were reverse-transcribed using 300 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 60-μl reaction mixtures in the presence of 2.5 μm oligo(dT) primer and 20 μm dNTP mixture for 60 min at 37 °C. For PCR amplification, specific oligonucleotide primer pairs (0.5 μm each) were incubated with 1 μl of cDNA, 1 unit of Taq polymerase, 1 × Taqbuffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2), 10 μm dNTP mixture, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP in a 20-μl reaction mixtures. The sequences of primers used in this study were as follows: DP5 sense primer, 5′-AGACCCAGCCCGGACCGAGCAA-3′, and DP5 antisense primer, 5′-ATAGCACTGAGGTGGCTATC-3′; neurofilament-M sense primer, 5′-TGGCTTAGATGTGAGCCCTG-3′, and neurofilament-M antisense primer, 5′-GACTATGGCATGTGAAGTGACC-3′; Bcl-2 sense primer, 5′-CTGGTGGACAACATCGCTCTG-3′, and Bcl-2 antisense primer, 5′-GGTCTGCTGACCTCACTTGTG-3′; Bcl-xl sense primer, 5′-AGGCTGGCGATGAGTTTGAA-3′, and Bcl-xl antisense primer, 5′-CGGCTCTCGGCTGCTGCATT-3′; Bax sense primer, 5′-TGGTTGCCCTTTTCTACTTTG-3′, and Bax antisense primer, 5′-GAAGTAGGAAAGGAGGCCATC-3′. Typical PCR parameters were 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 22–24 cycles followed by 72 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of 10 μl of each reaction mixture were electrophoresed through 5% polyacrylamide gels, and the dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. Control experiments were performed to determine the range of PCR cycles over which amplification efficiency remained constant. The identity of each PCR product was confirmed by subcloning the amplified cDNAs into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequencing. Aliquots of 1×107 primary neurons were plated on 10-cm dishes. Two dishes were used per immunoprecipitation. Cells were harvested and rinsed twice with PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min to remove large cellular debris. For each immunoprecipitation experiment, 3 μg of antibody was used. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocker with the antibodies. Recombinant protein G agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to each sample followed by another 1-h incubation at 4 °C on a rocker. The beads were then washed five times in lysis buffer to reduce nonspecific binding. After the last wash, all buffer was removed, and reducing sample buffer was added to each reaction mixture. Samples were boiled and loaded onto a 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). Blots were preblocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat milk, and washes were performed using PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Primary antibodies were used at 0.2–0.5% (v/v), and detection was performed with 0.1% alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Boehringer Mannheim) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) in PBS-T with 5% nonfat milk by the alkaline phosphatase method. Anti-Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl monoclonal antibodies were purchased from MBL (Japan). Clone 9E10 monoclonal antibody was used for detection of Myc epitope sequence. Anti-DP5 polyclonal antibodies were raised against the recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-DP5 fusion protein (1Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Imai Y. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18842-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 25–58 of DP5. The mammalian expression plasmids SFFV-human Bcl-2 and mouse Bcl-xl were provided by Prof. Nunez (University of Michigan Medical School). The Myc epitope sequence was attached to the rat DP5 cDNA to generate Myc-rat DP5 by PCR and cloned into pCDNA3 or pIND (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were used for transient transfection. 10-cm culture dishes containing 5×106 cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA by lipofection (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies, Inc.). The levels of expression of each protein were determined in total lysates by Western blotting. For inducible expression, transfection of plasmids and induction of expression were performed according to the supplier's recommendations. Briefly, Myc-DP5 cloned into pIND was cotransfected with pVgRXR into 293T cells. On the next day, cells were treated with 3 μm muristerone A (Invitrogen) to induce intracellular expression from pIND. For X-gal staining of cells expressing β-galactosidase, cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 3 min and stained with X-gal solution (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 3 mmK4Fe(CN)6, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% X-gal) at 37 °C. DP5 has a BH3 domain, which was shown to be essential for the interaction with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl proteins (Fig.1). Recently, Hrk, which was considered to be a human DP5 homologue, was shown to interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl by in vitro transfection analysis (3Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To confirm that rat DP5 interacts with members of the Bcl-2 family, 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids producing Myc-tagged DP5 and Bcl-xl. Immunoprecipitates were prepared using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-xl antibody. Western blotting with anti-Bcl-xl antibody revealed that 30-kDa Bcl-xl was co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-DP5 (Fig. 2 A). As the reverse experiment, we performed immunoprecipitation using anti-Bcl-xl antibody, followed by blotting with anti-Myc antibody. The 10-kDa Myc-DP5 was co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-xl (Fig. 2 B). To examine the interaction of Bcl-2 and DP5, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments similar to those used to assess the DP5-Bcl-xl interaction. Our results confirmed that DP5 specifically interacted with Bcl-2 (data not shown). However, we detected only a faint band of Bcl-2, which interacted with Myc-DP5 in contrast with the results of immunoprecipitation with anti-Bcl-xl antibody. Accordingly, we examined only the interaction of DP5 with Bcl-xl in the next set of experiments.Figure 2Interaction of DP5 and Bcl-xl in 293T cells. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. The DP5 expression plasmid was tagged with the human Myc amino acid sequence at the N terminus of DP5. Transfection was performed with equal amounts of plasmid DNA using empty plasmid as a control. A, lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Myc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Bcl-xl antibody (upper panel) and anti-Myc antibody (lower panel). B, immunoprecipitates with anti-Bcl-xl antibody were immunoblotted with anti-Bcl-xl antibody (upper panel) and anti-Myc antibody (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the neuronal toxicity of A β, cortical neurons were exposed to A β25–35 or A β1–40 at a concentration of 40 μm. Viability was quantified by trypan blue staining and morphological criteria at various time points. Neurons began to degenerate asynchronously, exhibiting shrinkage and irregularly shaped cell bodies with dystrophic neurites from about 12 h after A β exposure (Fig. 3). At 24 h, cultures treated with both A β25–35 and A β1–40showed 40% cell survival compared with controls. Neuronal death was prevented by treatment with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, at the same time as addition of A β. These results suggested that A β-induced cell death is dependent on macromolecular synthesis and is controlled by a genetic program. Our observations were consistent with those of previous studies (13Loo D.T. Copani A. Pike C.J. Whittemore E.R. Walencewicz A.J. Cotman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 16Estus S. Tucker H.M. Rooyen C.V. Wright S. Brigham E.F. Wogulis M. Rydel R.E. J.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 890-897PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the temporal changes in levels of DP5 mRNA during neuronal death induced by A β, we performed reverse transcription of mRNAs isolated from cortical neuronal cultures before and at various time points after A β treatment and analyzed the proportions of DP5 cDNAs obtained using RT-PCR (Fig. 4). We also analyzed the expression patterns of members of the Bcl-2 family including Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Bax. DP5 expression level was relatively low before A β stimulation. This signal increased at 6 h after addition of 40 μm A β25–35, and the level was maintained at least until 12 h, showing a subsequent reduction after this time point that appeared to be consistent with neuronal loss (Fig. 4 A). Stimulation with A β25–35 and A β1–40 showed almost equivalent induction of DP5 mRNA (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, when cortical neurons were exposed to A β25–35 or A β1–40 at a concentration of 20 μm, the pattern of expression of DP5 mRNA was the same as that at 40 μm (data not shown). On the other hand, the levels of Bcl-2 family mRNA expression did not change or were slightly diminished during the course of cell death, and DP5 mRNA expression was not induced by treatment with 40 μm A β40–1 (Fig. 4 C). These results suggested that within the Bcl-2 family, DP5 mRNA was selectively induced during A β-induced neuronal death. Previous studies showed that disruption of cellular calcium homeostasis occurs in neuronal apoptosis induced by A β (7Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. J.

Indeed, nifedipine, a blocker ofl-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (22Killer R.J. Science. 1987; 235: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), and dantrolene, an inhibitor of calcium release from ER stores (23Song S.-K. Karl I.E. Ackerman J.J.H. Hotchkiss R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3933-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), prevent neuronal death induced by A β. We next examined the changes in DP5 mRNA expression following treatment of cortical neurons with nifedipine or dantrolene. To test the abilities of these two agents to promote survival, cortical neurons treated with 40 μm A β25–35 were cultured for 24 h with or without these agents, and the numbers of surviving neurons were counted. Without additives, approximately 60% of neurons died following exposure to A β, whereas neuronal death was prevented in the presence of nifedipine or dantrolene (Fig. 5 A). After cortical neurons were treated with 40 μm A β for 6 h in the presence or absence of these agents, total RNA was extracted and analyzed for changes in DP5 gene expression by RT-PCR. Levels of products amplified by DP5-specific primers were markedly decreased in all cases treated with these two agents (Fig. 5 B). Quantification of the DP5 signals showed that the expression levels of DP5 in cortical neurons treated with calcium blockers were decreased to approximately the same levels as in nontreated controls (Fig.5 C). To determine whether DP5 interacts with members of the Bcl-2 family during neuronal apoptosis following exposure to A β, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting analysis of DP5 and Bcl-xl after treatment with A β (Fig.6). The expression of DP5 protein was increased in cortical neurons 6 h after exposure to A β25–35, consistent with the DP5 mRNA expression pattern (Fig. 6 A). DP5 did not bind with Bcl-xl before A β stimulation. At 6 h after treatment with A β, a 30-kDa band of Bcl-xl was detected in immunoprecipitates by anti-DP5 antibody (Fig.6 C). The expression levels of Bcl-xl proteins were equivalent in A β-stimulated and nonstimulated cultured neurons (Fig.6 B). These results suggested that DP5 specifically interacted with Bcl-xl during neuronal death induced by A β. Stimulation with A β resulted in an increase in level of DP5 mRNA within 6 h. A specific interaction between DP5 and Bcl-xl also occurred in cell death induced by A β. Our previous study indicated that overexpression of DP5 in cultured neurons was sufficient to induce cell death. Taken together, these observations suggested that increased expression of DP5 and its interaction with Bcl-xl play a significant role in the process of neuronal death. To examine the events involved in DP5-induced cell death after interaction with Bcl-xl, we analyzed the characteristics of DP5 expression-dependent cell death using ecdysone-inducible expression systems (24No D. Yao T.-P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transiently transfected with a pIND-derived plasmid expressing Myc-DP5 and pVgRXR plasmid. After culture for 24 h, cells were incubated in the presence of 3 μm muristerone A, an ecdysone analogue, for various periods. On addition of muristerone A, 293T cells rapidly began to undergo apoptosis within 6 h and showed <40% viability at 24 h (Fig. 7). The cell death was inhibited by the expression of Bcl-xl. Western blotting analysis revealed induction of DP5 by 1 h, and the level of expression was maintained up to 24 h after treatment with muristerone A. Cell death was significantly attenuated in the Ca2+-depleted state by exposure to 1 mm EGTA (Fig. 8 B), which provided preparations with low cytosolic and low sequestered Ca2+(22Killer R.J. Science. 1987; 235: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Dantrolene also prevented cell death. In contrast, depolarization by high potassium (35 mm) or nifedipine did not prevent cell death induced by expression of DP5, suggesting that the cell death involves calcium release from ER and the resultant disruption of calcium homeostasis causes cell death. Previous studies showed that A β induces apoptosis in neurons in primary culture (13Loo D.T. Copani A. Pike C.J. Whittemore E.R. Walencewicz A.J. Cotman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 16Estus S. Tucker H.M. Rooyen C.V. Wright S. Brigham E.F. Wogulis M. Rydel R.E. J.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1046-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanisms are still unclear. We found that the messenger RNA of DP5, which has been cloned as a gene induced in programmed cell death of sympathetic neurons deprived of NGF (1Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Imai Y. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18842-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), was selectively elevated after A β stimulation. Recently, gene expression patterns during neuronal death induced by treatment with A β were reported to be markedly similar to those observed in the models of sympathetic neurons deprived of NGF,i.e. induction of c-jun begins in the early stage followed by c-fos, fosB at the time of commitment to cell death in both culture models (16Estus S. Tucker H.M. Rooyen C.V. Wright S. Brigham E.F. Wogulis M. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7736-7745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). The temporal patterns of expression of several genes including DP5 during neuronal death after A β treatment indicated that A β stimulus activates a cellular genetic program for cell death similarly to NGF deprivation. Calcium influx contributes to A β-induced neuronal degeneration because removal of extracellular calcium (26Mattson M.P. Tomaselli K. Rydel R.E. Brain Res. 1993; 621: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and calcium channel blockers (18Weiss J.H. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19Ueda K. Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawasaki K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) protect neurons against A β toxicity. So we examined whether the DP5 gene induction after exposure to A β was changed following treatment with these agents. Cell death was prevented by treatment with nifedipine and dantrolene, which are blockers ofl-type voltage-dependent calcium channels and of calcium release from the ER, respectively. In these cases, the expression of DP5 mRNA was significantly suppressed, suggesting that induction of DP5 mRNA occurs downstream of the increase in cytosolic calcium concentration caused by A β. We considered that A β stimulus caused the influx of extracellular calcium, calcium release from the ER, and accumulation of reactive oxygen species, followed by activation of the apoptosis cascade involving induction of cell death-promoting genes such as DP5. The protein encoded by DP5 mRNA contains a BH3 domain that is critical for interaction with members of the Bcl-2 family and regulation of apoptosis. Harakiri (Hrk), which was reported to bind to members of the Bcl-2 family (3Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), is considered to be a human homologue of DP5 because it shows 72% overall amino acid sequence identity and the sequence of the BH3 region is completely conserved. Hrk physically interacts with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl at the BH3 region. We confirmed that DP5 also possessed the ability to interact with Bcl-2 family members. Nbk/Bik, Bid, and Hrk are known as proteins that contain only BH3 and were identified recently as interacting partners with Bcl-2 family members (3Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 4Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J.

Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Overexpression of these proteins including DP5 is sufficient for induction of apoptosis in several types of cells. The mechanisms by which these molecules induce apoptosis are not well known. There are two possible mechanisms as follows: proteins that contain only BH3 may be death effector molecules, i.e.Bcl-2 or the other Bcl-2 family members may be dominant negative regulators; alternatively, these molecules may promote cell death by inhibiting the death-suppressing activities of the Bcl-2 family. In the present study, the level of expression of DP5 in neurons was low under normal conditions. Death signals such as A β stimulus caused the accumulation of DP5 mRNA, but levels of expression of Bcl-2 family members were not changed or were diminished. Furthermore, the protein encoded by DP5 mRNA interacted with Bcl-xl during cell death. These observations lead us to hypothesize the scenario as follows: A β stimulus causes the selective accumulation of DP5 mRNA by increasing intracellular calcium concentration involved in activation of the cell death cascade followed by interaction of Bcl-2 family members and DP5 protein via the BH3 region. Binding to the BH3 domain could impair the survival-promoting activities of the Bcl-2 family (27Garcia I. Martinou I. Tsujimoto Y. Martinou J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar,28Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that DP5 could be an effector molecule because overexpression of Bcl-xl inhibited the killing activity of DP5. To examine the molecular events involved in DP5 expression-dependent cell death, we established an ecdysone-inducible expression system for DP5. 293T cells expressing DP5 rapidly underwent apoptosis in this system, and this cell death was blocked by perturbation of intracellular calcium concentration. Dantrolene, which is an inhibitor of calcium release from the ER and which is known to protect neurons against A β toxicity (29Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and EGTA prevented cell death induced by DP5. These agents provide the situation of low intracellular concentrations of calcium. In contrast, nifedipine, a blocker of l-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, had no effect. These results indicated that DP5-induced cell death involves calcium release from ER, but not calcium influx through plasma membrane channels. Previous studies have shown that ER calcium regulation contributes to apoptosis of neuronal (29Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nonneuronal cells (30Lam M. Dubyak G. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M. Li S.-H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bcl-2 protects lymphoma cells against apoptosis induced by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of ER calcium-ATPase, and suppresses release of calcium from the ER (32Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 33He H. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Collectively, overexpression of DP5 could affect intra- and extra-ER calcium homeostasis, and the resultant increase in cytosolic calcium concentration could lead to apoptosis. The localization of DP5 and its human homologue, Hrk, to the membranes of intracellular organelles (3Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) supports the above hypothesis. However, it is unclear whether DP5 can itself generate channels on the membranes similarly to Bax (34Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermond J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C.

In conclusion, the present study strongly suggested that DP5 plays a significant role in neuronal apoptosis followed by exposure to A β. We are currently engaged in generation of DP5 knockout mice to examine the resistance to A β toxicity using neurons derived from the mouse brain. These experiments will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration induced by A β and may allow for the development of therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.

https://openalex.org/W2077661104,"Excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle is believed to be triggered by direct protein-protein interactions between the sarcolemmal dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channel and the Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR) of sarcoplasmic reticulum. A 138-amino acid cytoplasmic loop between repeats II and III of the alpha1 subunit of the skeletal dihydropyridine receptor (the II-III loop) interacts with a region of the RyR to elicit Ca2+ release. In addition, small segments (10-20 amino acid residues) of the II-III loop retain the capacity to activate Ca2+ release. Imperatoxin A, a 33-amino acid peptide from the scorpion Pandinus imperator, binds directly to the RyR and displays structural and functional homology with an activating segment of the II-III loop (Glu666-Leu690). Mutations in a structural motif composed of a cluster of basic amino acids followed by Ser or Thr dramatically reduce or completely abolish the capacity of the peptides to activate RyRs. Thus, the Imperatoxin A-RyR interaction mimics critical molecular characteristics of the II-III loop-RyR interaction and may be a useful tool to elucidate the molecular mechanism that couples membrane depolarization to sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in vivo."

The inactivation was not pronounced in the absence of an electron donor, indicating that only the reduced enzyme form was inactivated by nitric oxide. The second-order rate constant of the reaction between reduced XO and nitric oxide was determined to be 14.8 ± 1.4m−1 s−1 at 25 °C. The inactivated enzymes lacked xanthine-dichlorophenolindophenol activity, and the oxypurinol-bound form of XO was partly protected from the inactivation. The absorption spectrum of the inactivated enzyme was not markedly different from that of the normal enzyme. The flavin and iron-sulfur centers of inactivated XO were reduced by dithionite and reoxidized readily with oxygen, and inactivated XDH retained electron transfer activities from NADH to electron acceptors, consistent with the conclusion that the flavin and iron-sulfur centers of the inactivated enzyme both remained intact. Inactivated XO reduced with 6-methylpurine showed no “very rapid” spectra, indicating that the molybdopterin moiety was damaged. Furthermore, inactivated XO reduced by dithionite showed the same slow Mo(V) spectrum as that derived from the desulfo-type enzyme. On the other hand, inactivated XO reduced by dithionite exhibited the same signals for iron-sulfur centers as the normal enzyme.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), are complex flavoproteins composed of two identical subunits ofM r 145,000; each subunit contains one molybdenum center, two non-identical Fe2S2-type iron-sulfur centers, and one FAD center. The enzymes catalyze oxidation of xanthine to uric acid with concomitant reduction of NAD+or molecular oxygen. The oxidative hydroxylation of xanthine to uric acid takes place at the molybdenum center, and reducing equivalents thus introduced into enzymes are transferred rapidly via intramolecular electron transfer to FAD, where physiological oxidation occurs (2Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4363-4382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both enzymes can reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (1Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), but XDH is characterized by high reactivity toward NAD+, but low reactivity toward O2, whereas XO has high reactivity toward O2, but negligible reactivity toward NAD+ (2Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4363-4382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian XDH can be converted to XO either by the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups or by limited proteolysis (3Corte E.D. Stirpe F. Biochem.

In particular, much attention has been paid to XO in connection with the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion injury since it has been proposed that superoxide/H2O2 production by XO is enhanced by the accelerated conversion of XDH to XO (6McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar), the accumulation of ATP degradation products (i.e. hypoxanthine and xanthine) that are substrates for XO (7Saugstad O.D. Pediatr.

Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), the precise mechanisms remain to be established (12Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25071-25076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Considering that NO generation also increases under conditions where superoxide generation increases, it is necessary to clarify whether NO inhibits superoxide-generating systems. We recently investigated two major sources of superoxide. We identified the site affected by NO in neutrophil NADPH oxidase (16Fujii H. Ichimori K. Hoshiai K. Nakazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32773-32778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and showed that NO inhibits XO during enzyme turnover under cell-free conditions (19Fukahori M. Ichimori K. Ishida H. Nakagawa H. Okino H. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism and kinetics of the reaction between NO and XO remained to be examined. Subsequent reports demonstrated the NO-induced inactivation of XDH and XO in interferon-γ-stimulated macrophages (20Rinaldo J.E. Clark M. Parinello J. Shepherd V.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells using exogenously and endogenously produced NO (21Hassoun P.M. Yu F.S. Zulueta J.J. White A.C. Lanzillo J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L809-L817PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cote C.G. Yu F.S. Zulueta J.J. Vosatka R.J. Hassoun P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L869-L874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct binding of NO to the enzyme iron-sulfur moiety or to its sulfhydryl groups was postulated since NO did not significantly affect the mRNA expression of XDH in these cellular systems (20Rinaldo J.E. Clark M. Parinello J. Shepherd V.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,22Cote C.G. Yu F.S. Zulueta J.J. Vosatka R.J. Hassoun P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L869-L874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may modify XO directly at a post-translational level. The exact mechanism of the inhibition still remains to be determined because of the limitations of the cellular system. In this study, we examined the kinetics of the reaction between XO and NO and identified the site responsible for the inactivation. The inhibitory kinetics of XDH were also examined to obtain basic data on the interaction of NO and the superoxide-generating system in the event of reduced oxygen supply, such as ischemia. XO was isolated from fresh bovine milk and purified according to the method reported previously (23Nishino T. Nishino T. Tsushima K. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The activity/flavin ratio (AFR) of the prepared XO was >190 (fully active enzyme has a value of 210) (23Nishino T. Nishino T. Tsushima K. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. J. Biol.

The desulfoenzyme was prepared by incubating the enzyme with 10 mm KCN for 2 h at 25 °C, followed by gel filtration to remove KCN as described by Massey and Edmondson (25Massey V. Edmondson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine milk XDH, prepared essentially according to the method of Nakamura and Yamazaki (26Nakamura M. Yamazaki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) without folate affinity chromatography, has an AFR of >100 and a dehydrogenase/oxidase activity ratio of >7. The dehydrogenase/oxidase activity ratio was determined as the ratio of the absorbance change at 295 nm under aerobic conditions in the presence of NAD+ to that in the absence of NAD+. Desulfo-XDH was prepared using the same procedure as described for XO, except that 5 mmdithiothreitol was added to the incubation mixture to avoid conversion to XO during preparation. Xanthine, allopurinol, and Hepes were obtained from Sigma. A stock solution of oxymyoglobin (∼0.7 mm) was prepared in 200 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.0) by reducing metmyoglobin (horse heart, Sigma) with sodium dithionite, followed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (medium) (27Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The solution was stored frozen at −80 °C until use. Spectrophotometric measurements were conducted on a Hitachi U-3200 spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlled circulator. The XO concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient of 37,800 m−1 cm−1 at 450 nm (28Massey V. Brumby P.E. Komai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1682-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of nitric oxide in reaction mixtures was determined spectrophotometrically using oxymyoglobin. The principle of this procedure is the same as that of the oxyhemoglobin method reported previously (29Murphy M.E. Noack E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The standard oxymyoglobin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient of 10,700m−1 cm−1 at 540 nm after conversion to cyanometmyoglobin (30Riggs A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 5-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 31Rothgeb T.M. Gurd F.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide solution was mixed with 5–10 μm oxymyoglobin in 200 mmHepes buffer (pH 7.4), and the increase in absorbance at 406 nm due to metmyoglobin formation was monitored. The standard curve for the assay was obtained by oxidation of oxymyoglobin with titrated amounts of potassium ferricyanide. The oxidation was complete at 15 min at room temperature. All activity measurements were performed at 25 °C. For XO, xanthine-O2 activity was measured spectrophotometrically in terms of the absorbance change at 295 nm (ε = 9500 m−1 cm−1) in 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.2 mm EDTA and 0.15 mm xanthine under air-saturated conditions. The electron transfer activity from xanthine or allopurinol (0.15 mm) to 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP; 50 μm) was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the absorbance of DCPIP at 600 nm (ε = 16,100m−1 cm−1) in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) under air. For XDH, all activity measurements were conducted in 50 mmsodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.2 mmEDTA. Xanthine-O2 activity was measured as described above for XO. Xanthine-NAD+ activity was measured with 0.15 mm xanthine and 0.5 mm NAD+. For the measurements of electron transfer activities between xanthine and DCPIP, NADH and DCPIP, NADH and ferricyanide, and NADH and methylene blue, 0.15 mm xanthine or NADH and 50 μmelectron acceptor (DCPIP, potassium ferricyanide, or methylene blue) were used. Each solution below was prepared with 0.2 m Hepes buffer containing 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). Anaerobic XO or XDH (40–80 μm) samples were prepared in an all-glass apparatus by sequential evacuation and re-equilibration with oxygen-free argon. Oxygen-free argon was prepared by passing commercially obtained pure argon through a column of Oxyout (Osaka Sanso). The solution of an electron donor such as xanthine, allopurinol, or NADH was sealed in a glass vial tube with a rubber cap and made anaerobic by bubbling oxygen-free argon. Saturated nitric oxide solution was prepared by bubbling NO gas, which was passed through 5 m KOH to remove NO2, into the anaerobic buffer. To prepare nitric oxide-treated enzymes, XO and XDH were first reduced by mixing enzyme solution into the electron donor solution anaerobically. The final concentrations of XO, XDH, and xanthine/allopurinol were 4–15, 10, and 150–300 μm, respectively. Then, saturated NO solution was added so that the final concentration became 250–500 μm. The mixture was drawn into a gas-tight syringe, incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, and filtered through a small column of Sephadex G-25. To check the effects of electron acceptors such as methylene blue (50 μm) and potassium ferricyanide (50 μm) during NO treatments, xanthine and the electron acceptor were mixed and made anaerobic before being mixed with enzyme solution. To examine the kinetics of the reaction between XDH/XO and nitric oxide, various amounts of saturated NO solution were added to enzyme solutions that had been pre-reduced anaerobically with xanthine or NADH (0.15 mm). The final concentrations of XO and XDH were 4 and 10 μm, respectively. The mixture was vigorously mixed and immediately drawn into a gas-tight syringe to avoid escape of NO into the gas phase and to maintain a constant NO concentration. The NO concentration of the reaction mixture in the syringe was immediately determined in duplicate by the oxyhemoglobin method. At various time points, 10-μl aliquots of the mixture were used to measure xanthine-O2 activity for XO and xanthine-NAD+reductase activity for XDH. XO (AFR > 200) or XDH (AFR = 109.00) in 0.2 m Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm NADH was mixed with saturated NO solution, which was prepared by bubbling NO gas into the anaerobic buffer, under air at 25 °C. The enzyme concentration and initial NO concentration of the mixture were 5 and 470 μm, respectively. Control experiments were conducted under the same conditions by mixing with anaerobic 0.2 mmHepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA instead of saturated NO solution. After having been incubated under air for 20 min, the mixture was gel-filtered, and aliquots were used for the determination of xanthine-oxygen or xanthine-NAD+ reductase activity. EPR measurements were conducted on a Jeol JES-FE2XG spectrometer. Sample temperature was controlled by a variable temperature controller above 77 K and by a continuous flow cryostat system (CT-470-esr-1, Research and Manufacturing Co., Inc.) below 77 K. The samples used to measure the Mo(V) signals of native XO, NO-treated XO, and desulfo-XO were prepared by reducing the different forms of XO based on reported procedures (32Malthouse J.P. George G.N. Lowe D.J. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and these EPR spectra were acquired at 123 K. To obtain the “very rapid” signal, enzymes (15 μm) in 20 mm Ches buffer (pH 10.2) were anaerobically reduced with 6-methylpurine (5 mm) for 1 min, and 0.5 ml of the solution was frozen 20 s after having been reoxidized by bubbling O2 through the solution. To obtain the “slow” or “rapid type 1” signal, enzymes (15 μm) in 20 mm Bicine buffer (pH 8.2) were made anaerobic by bubbling argon gas for 20 min, and 0.5 ml of the solution was frozen in an EPR sample tube 1 min after the addition of excess sodium dithionite. The EPR spectra of iron-sulfur centers (33Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2614-2620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained using the same sample as prepared for the slow signal and measured at 22 K. The conditions of the EPR measurements were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.2 GHz; response, 0.3 s; microwave power, 10 milliwatts; field modulation width, 0.2 millitesla; and sweep time, 2 or 4 min. The magnetic field was calibrated with the signal of an external Mn2+ (in MgO) standard. At this microwave frequency, the apparent g values of the third and fourth Mn2+ signals are 2.033 and 1.981, respectively. EPR spectra were acquired through an A/D converter board and processed with an IBM-PC compatible computer. Both desulfo-XO (AFR = 0) and NO-treated XO (AFR = 4.6) (4.6 μm) were reactivated using sodium thiosulfate and rhodanese as previously reported (34Nishino T. Usami C. Tsushima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1826-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). NO completely inactivated XO when XO was reduced with xanthine or allopurinol under anaerobic conditions prior to the NO treatment, although no marked decrease in the activity was observed when XO was not pre-reduced with xanthine or allopurinol, as shown in Table I. This is consistent with the previous report that XO was inactivated by NO during enzyme turnover of the xanthine oxidase reaction (19Fukahori M. Ichimori K. Ishida H. Nakagawa H. Okino H. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fact that the activity of NO-treated XO did not recover upon gel filtration with Sephadex G-25 indicates that the inhibition is an irreversible process. In the presence of an electron acceptor such as methylene blue (50 μm) or potassium ferricyanide (50 μm), XO was not markedly inhibited by NO even in the presence of xanthine (data not shown), in accordance with the result that only reduced XO can be inhibited by NO. As NO-treated XO lost both xanthine-O2 and xanthine-DCPIP activities, it is likely that NO reacted with the molybdenum center since DCPIP can directly accept an electron from reduced molybdenum (35Ikegami T. Nishino T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 247: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the extent of inhibition of XO pre-reduced with allopurinol is lower than that of XO pre-reduced with xanthine, although NO can also inhibit XO pre-reduced with allopurinol. This result is consistent with the conclusion that NO attacks XO at the molybdenum center since a small amount of oxypurinol, the oxidative product of allopurinol, might partially form a tight-binding complex with the reduced molybdenum (24Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to protect the enzyme from inactivation by NO.Table IInactivation of XO by NO under anaerobic conditionsConditionsActivityXanthine-O2Xanthine-DCPIPAllopurinol-DCPIP%Control100100100+NO77NDaND, not determined.ND+XanthinebXO was reduced by these substrates (150 μm) before the addition of NO under anaerobic conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” + NO03.85+AllopurinolbXO was reduced by these substrates (150 μm) before the addition of NO under anaerobic conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.”+ NO0cActivity determination was performed without reactivation with ferricyanide.2324XO was treated anaerobically with 250 μm NO for 30 min at 25 °C, followed by gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activities (measured in duplicate), are based on the rates of electron transfer from xanthine or allopurinol to O2or DCPIP and are expressed as mean percentage of the control (before treatment).a ND, not determined.b XO was reduced by these substrates (150 μm) before the addition of NO under anaerobic conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.”c Activity determination was performed without reactivation with ferricyanide. Open table in a new tab XO was treated anaerobically with 250 μm NO for 30 min at 25 °C, followed by gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activities (measured in duplicate), are based on the rates of electron transfer from xanthine or allopurinol to O2or DCPIP and are expressed as mean percentage of the control (before treatment). To clarify further the characteristics of the reaction between XO and NO, the reaction kinetics were determined. XO (4 μm) was pre-reduced with xanthine (150 μm) and treated with various concentrations of nitric oxide anaerobically at 25 °C, and the time course of the xanthine-oxygen reductase activity was determined. As shown in Fig.1 A, the XO activity was inhibited dose-dependently by NO. We presumed that XO reacts with NO according to second-order kinetics as follows (Equations1 and 2), XO+NO→kXO*+productsEquation 1 d[XO]/dt=−k[XO][NO]Equation 2 where XO denotes the active form, XO* denotes the inactive form, and k is the second-order rate constant for the reaction. When [XO] ≪ [NO], k′ = k[NO] can be assumed to be constant, and the reaction should follow pseudo first-order kinetics. Since the time courses of enzyme inhibition depicted in Fig. 1 A showed a single exponential form, a pseudo first-order rate constant (k′) could be determined at various NO concentrations. Fig. 1 B shows the dependence ofk′ on nitric oxide concentration. As expected, k′ was proportional to nitric oxide concentration, indicating that the reaction of XO with nitric oxide follows second-order kinetics as formulated in Equations 1 and 2. The second-order rate constant (k) obtained from the slope in Fig. 1 B is 14.8 ± 1.4 m−1 s−1(25 °C). The initial spectrum obtained from the fully oxidized form of NO-inactivated XO is very similar to that of the native enzyme (Fig.2). Since the absorption in the visible region is mainly attributable to the flavin and iron-sulfur centers, it is suggested that these cofactors remain intact. Upon addition of xanthine to the inactivated enzyme under anaerobic conditions, negligible immediate bleaching of the visible absorbance at around 450 nm was observed, but gradual bleaching was observed after prolonged incubation; only <20% reduction occurred even after 4 h. Such a biphasic reduction mode is very similar to that of the desulfo-type inactive enzyme (25Massey V. Edmondson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second phase of reduction might be due to slow reduction of the inactive enzyme by a small amount of the active enzyme remaining in the sample. Although bleaching of the visible absorbance at around 450 nm of the NO-inactivated enzyme was very slow, it occurred readily upon addition of dithionite as in the case of the native enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2, the flavin and iron-sulfur centers in NO-treated XO can be reduced with dithionite. Moreover, the fully reduced inactive enzyme was reoxidized readily when exposed to air, and the spectrum returned to that of the initial oxidized form (data not shown), indicating that the redox function of the flavin and iron-sulfur centers in NO-treated XO was preserved. Fig.3 shows the EPR spectra of iron-sulfur centers of dithionite-reduced XO before and after treatment with NO. It has been shown that the fully reduced active enzyme exhibits EPR signals due to two distinct Fe2S2 centers (33Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2614-2620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native and NO-treated XO showed essentially the same signals due to the iron-sulfur centers (gav = 1.95 and 2.01, respectively), and there was no indication that NO interacted with the iron-sulfur center of NO-treated XO. These spectroscopic observations suggested that NO reacted with neither flavins nor iron-sulfur centers, but rather with the molybdenum center.Figure 3EPR spectra of iron-sulfur centers of XO reduced with dithionite. The EPR spectra of dithionite-reduced iron-sulfur centers were obtained at 22 K for native XO (trace a) and NO-treated XO (trace b) (15 μm) in 20 mm Bicine buffer (pH 8.2) under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” mT, milliteslas.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All of the above results indicate that the inactivation of XO by nitric oxide occurs at the molybdenum center. To confirm this conclusion and to clarify what kind of change occurs at the molybdenum center, the EPR spectrum of NO-treated XO was measured and compared with those of the native and desulfo-type enzymes. First, the EPR spectrum of NO-treated XO was observed without treatment with reducing reagents. Although XO in the resting state, which has Mo(VI) and two antiferromagnetically coupled Fe(III)2S2 clusters, is EPR-silent, it can be paramagnetic if the NO adduct of XO forms at either iron center to produce Fe(II)-nitrosyl heme complexes. However, no paramagnetic signal other than a weak signal due to a non-heme iron impurity at g = 4.3 was observed (data not shown). Thus, no NO adduct was observable in the oxidized state of NO-treated XO. Fig.4 shows the EPR spectra of native and NO-treated XO reduced under conditions where the very rapid signal can be obtained. As shown in Fig. 4 (trace a), native XO showed a Mo(V) very rapid signal that has large g anisotropy when reduced with 6-methylpurine for a short time as reported previously (32Malthouse J.P. George G.N. Lowe D.J. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The species that gives the very rapid signal has a very short lifetime if xanthine is used as a substrate and corresponds to a transient intermediate Mo(V)-substrate complex in enzyme turnover (36Bennett B. Benson N. McEwan A.G. Bray R.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22 (suppl.): 285sCrossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, the observation of the very rapid signal provides evidence of reaction between molybdopterin and the substrate. However, as shown in Fig.4 B, no EPR signal was observed for the NO-treated enzyme under the same conditions, indicating that molybdopterin in NO-treated XO has no ability to interact with purine derivatives and that NO damages the molybdopterin. Fig. 5 shows Mo(V) EPR spectra of native XO (trace a), NO-treated XO (trace b), and CN-treated desulfo-XO (trace c) (15 μm) in 20 mm frozen Bicine buffer (pH 8.2) reduced with dithionite for 1 min. The native enzyme exhibits a rapid type 1 signal (32Malthouse J.P. George G.N. Lowe D.J. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 5 (trace a). On the other hand, NO-treated XO showed a different EPR spectrum (Fig. 5, trace b). The spectrum showed no evidence of an extra hyperfine interaction of the molybdenum center with NO nitrogen, which should split the signal into three lines. Thus, the molybdopterin in NO-treated XO had not been changed into its NO adduct. Furthermore, NO-treated XO showed a spectrum substantially identical to that of the CN-treated desulfoenzyme (Fig. 5, trace c), having similar apparent g values to those reported previously (32Malthouse J.P. George G.N. Lowe D.J. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is known that reduced desulfo-type xanthine oxidase, which is inactive because an essential sulfur atom coordinated to the molybdenum is replaced by an oxygen atom, shows the slow signal due to Mo(V), which is stable under anaerobic conditions (32Malthouse J.P. George G.N. Lowe D.J. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The Mo(V) in reduced NO-treated XO was also stable under anaerobic conditions. Thus, it is suggested that nitric oxide reacts with an essential sulfur in molybdopterin and removes it. It has been demonstrated that desulfo-XO undergoes reactivation by a sulfide-generating system containing rhodanese, thiosulfate, and sulfhydryl reagent up to half its maximal activity (34Nishino T. Usami C. Tsushima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1826-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine whether NO-treated XO can recover its activity by incubation with a sulfide-generating system, the change in the activity of NO-treated XO was determined over 3 h, and the time course was compared with that of the CN-treated desulfoenzyme (Fig.6). In the presence of sulfide, NO-treated XO was also reactivated, and its time course was almost the same as that of CN-treated desulfo-XO. Thus, it was confirmed that NO-treated XO has the same reactivity to sulfide as CN-treated desulfo-XO. The recovery of NO-treated XO was slightly low compared with that of the CN-treated desulfoenzyme, presumably because NO treatment caused minor inactivation via a route other than conversion to desulfo-XO. Since XDH has the same molybdopterin as XO, XDH is also expected to be inhibited by NO. As shown in Fig. 7, XDH (10 μm) reduced with xanthine (0.15 mm) under anaerobic conditions was inhibited by NO in the same manner as XO, whereas the oxidized enzyme was not markedly inhibited. Without xanthine, XDH was not inhibited by NO either. Moreover, XDH reduced with excess NADH was also inhibited by NO. Since the NADH-DCPIP, NADH-ferricyanide, and NADH-methylene blue activities of NO-treated XDH were almost equivalent to those of the native enzyme, as also found for CN-treated XDH (data not shown), it is concluded that FAD remained intact. Thus, it is concluded that reduced XDH is inhibited by NO in the same manner as XO. In the presence of enough NADH, XDH is kept in the reduced form even under aerobic conditions. So, it is possible that XDH is inhibited by NO in air. In the presence of 1 mm NADH, XO (5 μm) or XDH (5 μm) was mixed with saturated NO solution so that the initial NO concentration was 470 μm, and the catalytic activities were measured after 20 min. With NO treatment in air, XO activity was not markedly decreased (93.8 ± 2.8% of untreated XO), whereas XDH activity was almost completely inhibited (13 ± 0.8% of untreated XDH). Thus, as long as enough NADH is present, XDH is susceptible to the attack of NO even under aerobic conditions, where XO is not inhibited. XO contains multiple redox centers that are essential for enzyme activity and are plausible targets of NO attack. We examined the effect of NO on each redox center using enzyme kinetics and spectroscopic studies. Since NO forms an iron-nitrosyl adduct with iron-sulfur complexes (12Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25071-25076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), as was demonstrated in aconitase (37Henry Y. Lepoivre M. Drapier J.C. Ducrocq C. Boucher J.L. Guissani A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), we first examined the iron-sulfur centers by means of absorption spectroscopy and EPR. In NO-treated XO, the iron-sulfur centers were redox-active, and EPR proved that their environment remained unchanged; no nitrosyl-iron-sulfur complex was observed. Since aconitase has an Fe4S4-type cluster with at least one iron coordination with a solvent molecule, it may be more susceptible to NO attack than the Fe2S2-type clusters with complete cysteinyl ligation in XO. This is consistent with the fact that most of the reports on the NO sensitivity of iron-sulfur proteins refer to Fe4S4 clusters (12Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25071-25076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 37Henry Y. Lepoivre M. Drapier J.C. Ducrocq C. Boucher J.L. Guissani A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), except for a report on nitrosyl-iron complex formation from Fe2S2 ferredoxins (38Drapier J.C. Pellat C. Henry Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10162-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since it seemed that FAD in NO-treated XO was intact, the molybdenum center was considered the next most likely candidate for NO attack. The lack of electron transfer activity from xanthine to DCPIP and the very slow reduction of NO-treated XO by xanthine suggested that the molybdenum center was damaged. The EPR measurements indicated that NO reacts with an essential sulfur atom coordinated to the molybdenum center to afford a desulfo-type enzyme. This was confirmed by the fact that the NO-inactivated enzyme was reactivated by the sulfide-generating system, like CN-treated desulfo-XO. Since NO can react only with the reduced enzyme, i.e. ≥Mo(IV)–SH, not with the oxidized form, Mo(VI)=S (1Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), it seems that sulfhydryl coordinated to molybdenum is more susceptible to NO attack than Mo=S. Although the chemical mechanism of conversion of the sulfo to desulfo form by NO is not clear, probably cationic NO might attack the reduced sulfide to release SNO. It is interesting to note that the desulfo form of XO exists in a significant amount in rat liver cells (35Ikegami T. Nishino T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 247: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fact that NO reacts only with reduced XO explains why XO is not markedly inhibited by NO exposure under aerobic conditions. The moderate inhibition during enzyme turnover may reflect a comparatively low steady-state level of the reduced enzyme. However, since XO operates under a much lower oxygen tension in vivo, close to 10 mm Hg (39Staub N.C. Berne R.M. Levy M.N. Physiology. 4th Ed. Mosby, New York1998: 561-571Google Scholar), this restriction does not reduce the potential importance of this NO inhibition. Furthermore, the reactivity of NO toward XO in a reducing environment rather reinforces the importance of this inhibition under hypoxic conditions, where more reducing substrates such as hypoxanthine, xanthine, and NADH might be accumulated. Our finding that, under aerobic conditions, only XDH was inactivated in the presence of a reducing substrate, NADH, suggests that XDH, but not XO, may be inactivated by NO under conditions such as post-ischemic reperfusion, where oxygen is resupplied. Although XDH can produce a large amount of O·̄2 without NAD+ during xanthine-O2 turnover, this pathway should be inhibited since an excess amount of NAD+ is present in the normal cell (40Nishino T. Nishino T. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2518-2527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the conversion of XDH to XO seems to be necessary to explain the increased production of O·̄2 in so-called superoxide-induced injury during ischemia/reperfusion. However, it is still controversial whether conversion from XDH to XO occurs under post-ischemic conditions as postulated by McCord (6McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar). The O·̄2generation, however, was suggested to increase when the apparent ratio of XDH to XO changes. That is, as XDH is inhibited by the accumulated NADH during ischemia, accumulated hypoxanthine is utilized more by XO than would be the case under normal conditions, and increased superoxide production may occur upon reperfusion even though conversion from XDH to XO does not take place (41Nishino T. Nakanishi S. Okamoto K. Mizushima J. Hori H. Iwasaki T. Nishino T. Ichimori K. Nakazawa H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 42Nishino T. Tamura I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 309: 327-337Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The increased O·̄2generation can be alternatively explained in terms of NADH oxidation by XDH (42Nishino T. Tamura I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 309: 327-337Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 43Harrison R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The present results suggest another mechanism for change in the relative contributions of XO and XDH to O·̄2 generation if selective inactivation of XDH by NO occurs under post-ischemic conditions prior to the formation enough O·̄2. If once O·̄2 is generated in a large amount, which can react with NO with diffusion-limited rates to give peroxynitrite, decreased NO and formed peroxynitrite may make the situation worse for the tissue. Thus, although the generation of NO upon reperfusion was suggested to down-regulate O·̄2 generation through inhibition of XO by NO (21Hassoun P.M. Yu F.S. Zulueta J.J. White A.C. Lanzillo J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L809-L817PubMed Google Scholar), it is clear from the present experiments that the idea that NO serves as an antioxidant effector by suppressing XO activity in actual cellular systems is an oversimplification. It should also be noted that O·̄2 formation due to NADH oxidation, in which the molybdenum center does not participate, cannot be inhibited by NO.

However, where calmodulin binds in ACVIII and how the binding activates this cyclase have not yet been investigated. We have located two putative calmodulin-binding sites in ACVIII. One site is located at the N terminus as revealed by overlay assays; the other is located at the C terminus, as indicated by mutagenesis studies. Both of these calmodulin-binding sites were confirmed by synthetic peptide studies. The N-terminal site has the typical motif of a Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding domain, which is defined by a characteristic pattern of hydrophobic amino acids, basic and aromatic amino acids, and a tendency to form amphipathic α-helix structures. Functional, mutagenesis studies suggest that this binding makes a minor contribution to the Ca2+ stimulation of ACVIII activity, although it might be involved in calmodulin trapping by ACVIII. The primary structure of the C-terminal site resembles another calmodulin-binding motif, the so-called IQ motif, which is commonly Ca2+-independent. Mutagenesis and functional assays indicate that this latter site is a calcium-dependent calmodulin-binding site, which is largely responsible for the Ca2+ stimulation of ACVIII. Removal of this latter calmodulin-binding region from ACVIII results in a hyperactivated enzyme state and a loss of Ca2+ sensitivity. Thus, Ca2+/calmodulin regulation of ACVIII may be through a disinhibitory mechanism, as is the case for a number of other targets of Ca2+/calmodulin.

Details are emerging on some of the molecular features conferring catalytic and regulatory properties on these enzymes. All of the nine cloned adenylyl cyclases are large (1080–1248 amino acids) polypeptides that are proposed to comprise two cassettes of six transmembrane-spanning domains, each cassette being followed by a large cytoplasmic domain (1Sunahara R.K.

The other major cytoplasmic domains of mammalian adenylyl cyclases, the N terminus, the C1b region, and the C2b region, are not conserved at all and are speculated to reflect regulatory features of specific adenylyl cyclases (1Sunahara R.K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12190-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the likely calmodulin-binding domain on ACI has been localized to the C1b region (15Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the corresponding regulatory domain has not been identified on ACVIII. Indeed, ACVIII does not possess analogous calmodulin-binding sites in the C1b region. In the case of ACI, peptides corresponding to putative calmodulin-binding domains were used to identify a site in the C1b region as the likely site of calmodulin binding (16Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies strongly supported this assignment (15Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Wu Z. Wong S.T. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23766-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no information is yet available on the possible domains that mediate the Ca2+/calmodulin responsiveness of ACVIII. Given that ACI and ACVIII do not share similar C1b domains (they are only ∼40% similar at the amino acid level, compared with 80% similarity in the C1a region) and also that their regulation by Ca2+/calmodulin shows distinct properties, it might not be unexpected if different motifs and/or locations were involved.Identifying calmodulin-binding sites on proteins still mainly depends on experimentation, although some predictive criteria are available to guide experiments. For instance, many known Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding proteins possess a region that is often characterized by an amphipathic helix consisting of approximately 20 amino acid residues (18Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In these regions, basic amino acids are interspersed among hydrophobic residues, and aromatic amino acids normally appear near either end (16Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 19Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). However, sequence analysis based on these criteria does not always identify calmodulin-binding regions, and indeed, regions of proteins that bind to calmodulin sometimes do not fit these criteria. Another calmodulin-binding motif is the so-called “IQ motif,” consensus sequence IQXXXRGXXXR, which often (18Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) but not always (22Munshi H.G. Burks D.J. Joyal J.L. White M.F. Sacks D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15883-15889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Weitz D. Zoche M. Muller F. Beyermann M. Korschen H.G. Kaupp U.B. Koch K.-W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2273-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) binds calmodulin in a Ca2+-independent manner.The present studies used a combination of calmodulin overlay assays, mutagenesis, and peptide inhibition studies to locate the calmodulin regulatory domains on ACVIII. Surprisingly, a primary site was located in the C2b region, while an ancillary site that appeared to play a minor autoinhibitory role was located in the N terminus.DISCUSSIONThis study has explored the calmodulin-binding sites on ACVIII. The related Ca2+-stimulable ACI binds calmodulin in the C1b region of the molecule. However, ACVIII and ACI are very dissimilar (only 40% homologous) in this region. Therefore, it might not have been unexpected that different sites would mediate the Ca2+ stimulation of ACVIII. Calmodulin overlay assays revealed one putative Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding site in the N terminus of ACVIII (Fig. 1). However, without this region the enzyme was still sensitive to Ca2+(Figs. 2 and 3). On the other hand, using mutagenesis and functional assays, only those mutants lacking the C2b region, such as C2Δ1184–1248 and NC2Δ1–106, Δ1184–1248, could not be stimulated by Ca2+either in vivo or in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3). This suggests that the C-terminal region is responsible for the Ca2+/calmodulin stimulation of ACVIII. Moreover, the high basal activities of C2Δ1184–1248 and NC2Δ1–106, Δ1184–1248 suggests the removal of autoinhibitory domains (the C2b region playing the major role), which suppress the activity of wild type ACVIII. The binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to the autoinhibitory domain apparently relieves the inhibitory binding and activates the enzyme. Such a disinhibitory mechanism is employed in a number of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated enzymes, such as Ca2+-regulated nitric-oxide synthase (44Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23851-23859Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a Na+/H+ exchanger (48Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Iwamoto T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12854-12861Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and calcineurin (49Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appears as though most of the C2b region might participate as the inhibitory binding domain, since the two synthetic peptides 8Ccam (25 residues) and 8CT (20 residues) from the C2b region did not inhibit ACVIII activity in the absence of Ca2+ and calmodulin (Fig. 6 C). This disinhibition mechanism of Ca2+/calmodulin stimulation is different from that of forskolin, which is thought to stabilize the C1/C2 heterodimer to activate the adenylyl cyclase activity (9Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 10Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The latter suggestion is supported by the fact that forskolin and Ca2+/calmodulin synergistically stimulate ACVIII.The putative calmodulin-binding site in the C terminus has the signature sequence of an IQ motif, which generally reflects Ca2+-independent calmodulin binding. It is possible that the binding of calmodulin is Ca2+-independent and that Ca2+ binding changes the conformation of bound calmodulin to activate the enzyme. Alternatively, the binding of calmodulin may be Ca2-dependent as is the case with the β-subunit of rod photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (23Weitz D. Zoche M. Muller F. Beyermann M. Korschen H.G. Kaupp U.B. Koch K.-W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2273-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is of some interest that the peptide synthesized from this region (8Ccam) is only 5 times less effective than 8CamkII, which is a conventional calmodulin-binding peptide. This observation underscores how much we still need to learn about the molecular characteristics of calmodulin-binding sequences.The putative calmodulin-binding site for the N terminus of ACVIII is a conventional Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding site, which is reinforced by the results of overlay assays. The fact that the double deletion NC2Δ1–106, Δ1184–1248 has higher activity in vivo (Fig. 2) and can be inhibited by a lower concentration of Ca2+ (Fig. 5 A) than C2Δ1184–1248 suggests that this site contributes to the Ca2+ stimulation of ACVIII, although this contribution must be minor.The fact that there is apparently more residual calmodulin in ACVIII wild type membrane preparations than in those of NΔ1–106(Fig. 5 B) might suggest a role of the N terminus of ACVIII as a Ca2+-independent calmodulin trap, notwithstanding the apparently conflicting evidence of the Ca2+-dependent manner of the N-terminal calmodulin-binding site from overlay assays.Unlike the two regulatory domains (the N terminus and the C2b region) discussed above, the C1b region does not have a free end, which suggests that the disruptions on this region could more easily change the activity of adenylyl cyclases. However, continuous deletions in the C1b region of ACVIII could not eliminate the Ca2+stimulation of ACVIII (Fig. 2 A), while, by contrast, a point mutation in this region of ACI abolished its Ca2+sensitivity (17Wu Z. Wong S.T. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23766-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The different calmodulin-binding sites on ACVIII and ACI are underlined by some differences in their regulation by Ca2+/calmodulin; for instance, ACI is more sensitive to lower concentrations of Ca2+ than is ACVIII, and ACVIII is more stimulable by Ca2+/calmodulin than ACI (25Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The calmodulin-binding site in ACI is rich in basic amino acids (net charge is +7), and the binding is Ca2+-dependent (15Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,16Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Since no hyperactivity was observed by mutating the C1b region on ACI (15Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Wu Z. Wong S.T. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23766-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the movement of the C1b region is likely to be more restrained than those of the N terminus and C terminus, the mechanism of Ca2+/calmodulin regulation of ACI might be to stabilize the C1/C2 heterodimer, as has been proposed for forskolin and Gsαa (9Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 10Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), unlike the disinhibitory mechanism we have proposed for ACVIII.In conclusion, two calmodulin-binding sites exist on ACVIII, one (at the C terminus) is of profound regulatory significance, whereas the other (at the N terminus) plays a more minor role. Whether these two domains of ACVIII physically interact to share the same molecule of calmodulin remains to be determined in future studies. Given that the C1a and C2a regions clearly interact for catalytic activity (4Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5Whisnant R.E.

Ca2+ elicits a prominent stimulation of ACI1 and ACVIII, which is mediated by loosely bound calmodulin (3Tang W.-J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.-J. Feinstein P.G. Orth K. Slaughter C. Reed R.R. Gilman A.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12190-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the likely calmodulin-binding domain on ACI has been localized to the C1b region (15Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the corresponding regulatory domain has not been identified on ACVIII. Indeed, ACVIII does not possess analogous calmodulin-binding sites in the C1b region. In the case of ACI, peptides corresponding to putative calmodulin-binding domains were used to identify a site in the C1b region as the likely site of calmodulin binding (16Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies strongly supported this assignment (15Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Wu Z. Wong S.T. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23766-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no information is yet available on the possible domains that mediate the Ca2+/calmodulin responsiveness of ACVIII. Given that ACI and ACVIII do not share similar C1b domains (they are only ∼40% similar at the amino acid level, compared with 80% similarity in the C1a region) and also that their regulation by Ca2+/calmodulin shows distinct properties, it might not be unexpected if different motifs and/or locations were involved. Identifying calmodulin-binding sites on proteins still mainly depends on experimentation, although some predictive criteria are available to guide experiments. For instance, many known Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding proteins possess a region that is often characterized by an amphipathic helix consisting of approximately 20 amino acid residues (18Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In these regions, basic amino acids are interspersed among hydrophobic residues, and aromatic amino acids normally appear near either end (16Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F.

However, sequence analysis based on these criteria does not always identify calmodulin-binding regions, and indeed, regions of proteins that bind to calmodulin sometimes do not fit these criteria. Another calmodulin-binding motif is the so-called “IQ motif,” consensus sequence IQXXXRGXXXR, which often (18Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) but not always (22Munshi H.G. Burks D.J. Joyal J.L. White M.F. Sacks D.B.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2273-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) binds calmodulin in a Ca2+-independent manner. The present studies used a combination of calmodulin overlay assays, mutagenesis, and peptide inhibition studies to locate the calmodulin regulatory domains on ACVIII. Surprisingly, a primary site was located in the C2b region, while an ancillary site that appeared to play a minor autoinhibitory role was located in the N terminus. DISCUSSIONThis study has explored the calmodulin-binding sites on ACVIII. The related Ca2+-stimulable ACI binds calmodulin in the C1b region of the molecule. However, ACVIII and ACI are very dissimilar (only 40% homologous) in this region. Therefore, it might not have been unexpected that different sites would mediate the Ca2+ stimulation of ACVIII. Calmodulin overlay assays revealed one putative Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding site in the N terminus of ACVIII (Fig. 1). However, without this region the enzyme was still sensitive to Ca2+(Figs. 2 and 3). On the other hand, using mutagenesis and functional assays, only those mutants lacking the C2b region, such as C2Δ1184–1248 and NC2Δ1–106, Δ1184–1248, could not be stimulated by Ca2+either in vivo or in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3). This suggests that the C-terminal region is responsible for the Ca2+/calmodulin stimulation of ACVIII. Moreover, the high basal activities of C2Δ1184–1248 and NC2Δ1–106, Δ1184–1248 suggests the removal of autoinhibitory domains (the C2b region playing the major role), which suppress the activity of wild type ACVIII. The binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to the autoinhibitory domain apparently relieves the inhibitory binding and activates the enzyme. Such a disinhibitory mechanism is employed in a number of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated enzymes, such as Ca2+-regulated nitric-oxide synthase (44Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appears as though most of the C2b region might participate as the inhibitory binding domain, since the two synthetic peptides 8Ccam (25 residues) and 8CT (20 residues) from the C2b region did not inhibit ACVIII activity in the absence of Ca2+ and calmodulin (Fig. 6 C). This disinhibition mechanism of Ca2+/calmodulin stimulation is different from that of forskolin, which is thought to stabilize the C1/C2 heterodimer to activate the adenylyl cyclase activity (9Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 10Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The latter suggestion is supported by the fact that forskolin and Ca2+/calmodulin synergistically stimulate ACVIII.The putative calmodulin-binding site in the C terminus has the signature sequence of an IQ motif, which generally reflects Ca2+-independent calmodulin binding. It is possible that the binding of calmodulin is Ca2+-independent and that Ca2+ binding changes the conformation of bound calmodulin to activate the enzyme. Alternatively, the binding of calmodulin may be Ca2-dependent as is the case with the β-subunit of rod photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (23Weitz D. Zoche M. Muller F. Beyermann M. Korschen H.G. Kaupp U.B. Koch K.-W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2273-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is of some interest that the peptide synthesized from this region (8Ccam) is only 5 times less effective than 8CamkII, which is a conventional calmodulin-binding peptide. This observation underscores how much we still need to learn about the molecular characteristics of calmodulin-binding sequences.The putative calmodulin-binding site for the N terminus of ACVIII is a conventional Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding site, which is reinforced by the results of overlay assays. The fact that the double deletion NC2Δ1–106, Δ1184–1248 has higher activity in vivo (Fig. 2) and can be inhibited by a lower concentration of Ca2+ (Fig. 5 A) than C2Δ1184–1248 suggests that this site contributes to the Ca2+ stimulation of ACVIII, although this contribution must be minor.The fact that there is apparently more residual calmodulin in ACVIII wild type membrane preparations than in those of NΔ1–106(Fig. 5 B) might suggest a role of the N terminus of ACVIII as a Ca2+-independent calmodulin trap, notwithstanding the apparently conflicting evidence of the Ca2+-dependent manner of the N-terminal calmodulin-binding site from overlay assays.Unlike the two regulatory domains (the N terminus and the C2b region) discussed above, the C1b region does not have a free end, which suggests that the disruptions on this region could more easily change the activity of adenylyl cyclases. However, continuous deletions in the C1b region of ACVIII could not eliminate the Ca2+stimulation of ACVIII (Fig. 2 A), while, by contrast, a point mutation in this region of ACI abolished its Ca2+sensitivity (17Wu Z. Wong S.T. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23766-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The different calmodulin-binding sites on ACVIII and ACI are underlined by some differences in their regulation by Ca2+/calmodulin; for instance, ACI is more sensitive to lower concentrations of Ca2+ than is ACVIII, and ACVIII is more stimulable by Ca2+/calmodulin than ACI (25Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The calmodulin-binding site in ACI is rich in basic amino acids (net charge is +7), and the binding is Ca2+-dependent (15Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23766-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the movement of the C1b region is likely to be more restrained than those of the N terminus and C terminus, the mechanism of Ca2+/calmodulin regulation of ACI might be to stabilize the C1/C2 heterodimer, as has been proposed for forskolin and Gsαa (9Zhang G.

https://openalex.org/W1968370663,"alpha-Sarcoglycan is a component of the sarcoglycan complex of dystrophin-associated proteins. Mutations of any of the sarcoglycan genes cause specific forms of muscular dystrophies, collectively termed sarcoglycanopathies. Importantly, a deficiency of any specific sarcoglycan affects the expression of the others. Thus, it appears that the lack of sarcoglycans deprives the muscle cell of an essential, yet unknown function. In the present study, we provide evidence for an ecto-ATPase activity of alpha-sarcoglycan. alpha-Sarcoglycan binds ATP in a Mg2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent manner. The binding is inhibited by 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP and ADP. Sequence analysis reveals the existence of a consensus site for nucleotide binding in the extracellular domain of the protein. An antibody against this sequence inhibits the binding of ATP. A dystrophin.dystrophin-associated protein preparation demonstrates a Mg-ATPase activity that is inhibited by the antibody but not by inhibitors of endo-ATPases. In addition, we demonstrate the presence in the sarcolemmal membrane of a P2X-type purinergic receptor. These data suggest that alpha-sarcoglycan may modulate the activity of P2X receptors by buffering the extracellular ATP concentration. The absence of alpha-sarcoglycan in sarcoglycanopathies leaves elevated the concentration of extracellular ATP and the persistent activation of P2X receptors, leading to intracellular Ca2+ overload and muscle fiber death."

G., Hasegawa, M., Smith, M. J., and Crowther, R. A. (1996) Nature383, 550–553). The biochemical mechanism by which sulfated glycosaminoglycans stimulate tau phosphorylation and cause tau aggregation remains unclear. In this study, disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), a bifunctional chemical cross-linker, cross-linked tau dimers, tetramers, high molecular size aggregates, and two tau species of sizes 72 and 83 kDa in the presence of heparin. In the absence of heparin only dimeric tau was cross-linked by DSS. Fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration revealed that 72- and 83-kDa species were formed by intramolecular cross-linking of tau by DSS. These observations indicate that heparin, in addition to causing aggregation, also induces a conformational change in tau in which reactive groups are unmasked or move closer leading to the DSS cross-linking of 72- and 83-kDa species. Heparin-induced structural changes in tau molecule depended on time of heparin exposure. Dimerization and tetramerization peaked at 48 h, whereas conformational change was completed within 30 min of heparin exposure. Heparin exposure beyond 48 h caused an abrupt aggregation of tau into high molecular size species. Heparin stimulated tau phosphorylation by neuronal cdc2-like kinase (NCLK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphopeptide mapping and phosphopeptide sequencing revealed that tau is phosphorylated by NCLK on Thr212 and Thr231 and by cAMP-dependent protein kinase on Ser262 only in the presence of heparin. Heparin stimulation of tau phosphorylation by NCLK showed dependence on time of heparin exposure and correlated with the heparin-induced conformational change of tau. Our data suggest that heparin-induced conformational change exposes new sites for phosphorylation within tau molecule. In Alzheimer's disease, microtubule-associated protein tau becomes abnormally phosphorylated and aggregates into paired helical filaments. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulfate were shown to accumulate in pretangle neurons, stimulate in vitro tau phosphorylation, and cause tau aggregation into paired helical filament-like filaments. The sulfated glycosaminoglycan-tau interaction was suggested to be the central event in the development of neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease brain (Goedert, M., Jakes, R., Spillantini, M.

Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). PHF-tau (tau isolated from PHFs) has retarded mobility on an SDS-gel, is highly insoluble, is abnormally phosphorylated (i.e. contains more phosphate than normal tau), and is functionally inactive (1Lee V.M.-Y.

After dephosphorylation, PHF-tau migrates as normal tau on an SDS-gel and regains the ability to bind to, and regulate, microtubule dynamics (4Alonso A.D.C. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc.

Abnormal phosphorylation may prevent tau from performing microtubule-related functions, resulting in cytoskeleton instability, loss of axonal transport, and PHF formation (3Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Tau is a natural phosphoprotein, and sites that are phosphorylated in normal adult brain (6Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara K.Y. J. Biol.

Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), is also hyperphosphorylated. Strikingly, both normal adult tau and fetal tau do not form PHFs. Furthermore, PHF-like filaments can be reconstituted from tau molecules that do not contain any phosphate (7Schweers O.

These observations have raised the possibility that abnormal phosphorylation alone may not be sufficient, and another factor(s) may be involved in converting tau to PHFs. There are 19 phosphorylation sites within PHF-tau (2Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Aberrant activation of tau-specific kinase (s) has been suggested to lead to the abnormal phosphorylation of tau in AD brain (3Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), because adult tau is phosphorylated only on four sites (6Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K.

Therefore, considerable effort is being made by many investigators to identify kinases that phosphorylate tau. A number of proline-directed and non-proline-directed kinases phosphorylate tau in vitro(10Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the above-mentioned kinases normally phosphorylate a diverse group of proteins in neurons, but in AD brain only phosphorylation of tau is significantly up-regulated (3Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Therefore tau, in AD brain, may be phosphorylated either by a kinase (s) that is yet to be identified or by a known kinases in the presence of a tau-specific substrate modulator, which renders tau more susceptible to phosphorylation. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (such as heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate) are sulfated copolymers of glucosamine and uronic acid residues (23Roden L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated the presence of glycosaminoglycans in senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangle (9Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A.

Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). An increase in the sulfated glycosaminoglycans within the nerve cells was suggested to trigger the hyperphosphorylation of tau, destabilization of microtubules, and assembly of PHFs (9Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The interaction of sulfated glycosaminoglycan and tau was suggested to be the central event in the development of neuropathology in AD (9Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 33Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 476-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical mechanism by which glycosaminoglycans enhance tau phosphorylation and cause tau to aggregate into PHFs remains unclear. In this study, we have investigated the effect of heparin on the structure and phosphorylation of tau by chemical cross-linking and phosphopeptide mapping. Herein we report that heparin, in addition to causing aggregation of tau, also changes tau's conformation, exposing new sites within the tau molecule for kinase phosphorylation. Tau protein used in this study was purified from extracts of Escherichia coli overexpressing the longest isoform of human tau (htau 40) as described (19Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except effluent from Q-Sepharose column was chromatographed through an S-Sepharose column. Neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase (NCLK) was purified from fresh bovine brain extract as described previously (34Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A kinase), catalytic subunit of A kinase (C subunit), trypsin, and thermolysin (protease type X), and Kemptide (LRRASLG) were from Sigma. Preparations of polyclonal antibody against bovine brain tau and synthetic peptide substrate of NCLK (KTPKKAKKPKTPKKAKKL) were described previously (19Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The concentration of tau was estimated spectrophotometrically (35Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Amounts of A kinase, C subunit, and Kemptide were based on their dry weights. Concentration of synthetic peptide NCLK substrate was determined by amino acid analysis. The amount of NCLK was estimated by enzymatic activity (34Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, NCLK activity was measured as described previously (19Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in an assay mixture containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm [32P]ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 μm peptide substrate, or 0.5 mg/ml tau and 400 units/ml NCLK. The assay was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of kinase to a 20-μl mixture containing the rest of the assay mixture components. After 20 min at 30 °C, aliquots were withdrawn and analyzed for the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the substrate by phosphocellulose strip assay. Activity of C subunit was determined as above, except Kemptide was used as the peptide substrate, and the concentration of C subunit was 10 μg/ml. A kinase was assayed in a manner similar to that described above for C subunit, except the assay mixture also contained 10 μm cAMP. Chemical cross-linking of tau by disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), a homobifunctional chemical cross-linker with an 11.4-Å spacer arm, was performed essentially as described previously (36Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28328-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in a mixture containing 1.5 mg/ml tau, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm DSS (Pierce) and 2%N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of DSS stock solution in DMF to 49 μl of mixture containing the rest of the cross-linking mixture components. After various time points at room temperature, aliquots were removed, mixed with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS), boiled, and electrophoresed on a 7.5% Laemmli SDS-gel. The amounts of cross-linked bands were quantitated by scanning the gels using a Molecular Dynamics SI personal densitometer. Band intensities were determined by dividing the optical density of each cross-linked band with the band intensity of tau control (treated with the solvent). The amount of tau that was not recovered in the gel was expressed as the higher molecular size species that did not enter the gel after DSS cross-linking. Apparent molecular weights of various cross-linked species were determined essentially as described previously (36Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28328-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Tau (0.5 mg), phosphorylated for 6 h by NCLK or A kinase, was digested with trypsin and subjected to HPLC C18 reverse phase chromatography essentially as described previously (19Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To purify phosphopeptide 1, peak 1 fractions depicted in Fig. 5 A were combined, concentrated to ∼0.5 ml, and chromatographed through a Sephadex G-25 column (0.5 × 25 cm) preequilibrated and eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The effluent fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected. Only one radioactive peak eluted from the column. Fractions containing radioactivity were combined, concentrated, and injected into an HPLC column as described above. The column was eluted with an acetonitrile gradient of 0–30% in 50 min. Phosphopeptide 3b was purified from peak 3 (see Fig.5 B) fractions and is shown in Fig. 6 B. To purify phosphopeptide 4, peak 4 fractions (see Fig. 5 B) were vacuum dried and redissolved in 0.2 ml of 50 mmNH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) containing 25 μg/ml thermolysin. The sample was then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and then injected into an HPLC column. The peptide was then eluted from the column by a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–40%) in 50 min. To purify phosphopeptide e, peak e fractions (see Fig. 7 B) were combined, vacuum dried, dissolved in 500 μl of 50 mmNH4HCO3 containing 25 μg/ml thermolysin, and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After incubation, the sample was loaded onto a ∼1-ml DEAE-Sephacel (Sigma) column pre-equilibrated in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.0). The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with 0.25 m NaCl in equilibration buffer. Effluent fractions (0.2 ml each) were collected. Fractions containing radioactivity were combined and concentrated to ∼0.2 ml, and the phosphopeptide was purified by HPLC as above using acetonitrile gradient 0–40% in 50 min. Phosphopeptides were sequenced using a gas phase amino acid sequencer (19Paudel H.K. J. Biol.

Peak 3 fractions from Fig. 5, A and B were pooled separately and fractionated through a Sephadex G 25 column. Effluent fractions containing radioactivity were pooled, lyophilized, redissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and rechromatographed by HPLC. All the chromatographic conditions were same as in Fig. 5, except the acetonitrile gradient was 0–45% in 50 min. Effluent-containing peptide peaks were manually collected, and 10 μl was counted in a scintillation counter. A, HPLC profile of peak 3from Fig. 5 A; B, HPLC profile of peak 3 from Fig. 5 B.

Tau species (0.5 mg each) phosphorylated by A kinase in the absence and presence of heparin were trypsinized and subjected to phosphopeptide mapping as in Fig. 5.Insets, HPLC profiles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When tau was incubated with DSS and the product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, there was a time-dependent formation of a heavier species with a concomitant decrease in the tau band intensity (Fig.1 A, lanes 2–4). The molecular size of the heavier band on an SDS-gel was estimated to be ∼153 kDa. In a previous study we have shown that the tau isoform used in this study that migrates as a 65-kDa band on the SDS-gel is a mixture of tau monomers and dimers when purified from bacterial lysate. These dimers, when cross-linked by DSS, migrate with a size of ∼151 kDa on an SDS-gel (36Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28328-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the cross-linked band in Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 4, is the dimeric tau. Cross-linking of tau under identical conditions in the presence of heparin showed four major differences when compared with tau cross-linked alone (Fig. 1). First, the intensity of the dimeric band was higher in tau cross-linked in the presence of heparin (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3, 4 and 6–8). Second, a band with size of ∼246 kDa was formed in the presence, but not in the absence, of heparin. Because the molecular size of tau is ∼65 kDa (Fig.1 A), this 246-kDa band is ∼3.8 times heavier than tau and must therefore be tetrameric tau. Third, a protein band that migrated as a streak on the top portion of the gel was formed only when heparin was present in the cross-linking mixture (Fig. 1, lanes 7and 8). This band must be a heavy molecular size tau aggregate cross-linked by DSS. Fourth, in the presence of heparin, two species of molecular sizes 72 and 83 kDa were also cross-linked by DSS (Fig. 1, lanes 6–8). When immunoblotted using an anti-heparin monoclonal antibody (mAb; Chemicon), none of the above cross-linked bands displayed immunoreactivity (data not shown), indicating that the DSS cross-linked bands were not formed by tau-heparin cross-linking. Densitometric quantitation of various bands in Fig. 1 A indicated that at the 15-min time point 3.5% dimeric tau was cross-linked by DSS in the absence of heparin, whereas in the presence of heparin 4.1, 6.2, 10.5, 7.5, and 3.0% tau was cross-linked into 72-kDa, 83-kDa, dimer, tetramer, and higher molecular size species, respectively. The cross-linking of dimeric, tetrameric, and higher aggregates by DSS in Fig. 1 suggested that heparin promotes dimerization and causes the formation of tetrameric and higher molecular sized tau species. These observations are consistent with previous reports and indicate that heparin causes tau aggregation (9Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 32Hasegawa M. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33118-33124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To interpret the cross-linking of 72- and 83-kDa bands by DSS in the presence of heparin (Fig. 1), we wished to know whether these two cross-linked bands were formed by cross-linking of tau intermolecularly or intramolecularly. Because DSS cross-linked dimer and tetramer migrated with molecular sizes of 153 and 246 kDa, respectively, on an SDS-gel (Fig. 1 A), the sizes 72 and 83 kDa are too small to be tau dimer, trimer, or tetramer that would have been formed if tau were cross-linked intermolecularly. To substantiate the idea that 72- and 83-kDa bands are formed by intramolecular cross-linking, we cross-linked tau (0.75 mg) with DSS in the presence of heparin as described under “Materials and Methods.” The cross-linked tau was then fractionated through a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) Superose 12 gel filtration column (Fig.2 A), and various column fractions were immunoblotted using anti-tau antibody (Fig.2 C). Tau tetramers were recovered within fractions 32–36 with peak fraction 34. Tau dimers were present within fractions 36–40 with peak fraction 38. The 72- and 83-kDa species were present within fractions 40–44 with peak fraction 42. Importantly, tau chromatographed through the same column under identical conditions eluted with peak fraction 42 (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the sizes of 72- and 83-kDa bands correspond to monomeric tau. As shown in Fig. 1, 72- and 83-kDa species are cross-linked by DSS only in the presence of heparin. These observations indicated that heparin causes a conformational change that exposes groups reactive to DSS within tau molecule leading to intramolecular covalent cross-linking of tau by DSS. These cross-linked tau species migrate slightly slower than tau on SDS-gels. In a previous study (9Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), heparin-induced aggregation of tau was reported to be dependent on time of incubation, and PHF-like filaments were formed after incubating tau with heparin for >48 h. We therefore preincubated tau with heparin for various time points. Aliquots were removed from the preincubation mixture, treated with DSS, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The intensities of various bands on the gel were quantitated. The amount of tau that was not recovered on the gel was regarded as the high molecular size aggregate, which, after cross-linking, did not enter the SDS-gel. As shown on Fig. 3, A andB, the intensities of the dimeric and tetrameric bands increased with increasing time of preincubation, peaked at 48 h (Fig. 3 A, lane 11) and diminished significantly at 72 and 96 h. The formation of the higher aggregate tau, which was slow until 48 h, sharply increased with concomitant decrease in the intensities of all other cross-linked and monomeric tau bands when incubated beyond 48 h (Fig. 3 B). Like the dimeric band, 72- and 83-kDa bands were visible within a few min of preincubation with heparin (Fig. 3 A, lane 3) and displayed a biphasic effect with respect to preincubation time (Fig. 3 B). However, these two bands peaked at the 30-min time point (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6 andB), remained constant for several hr, and then declined very slowly until 48 h (lane 11). At 72 and 96 h, both bands progressively faded. In conclusion, the dimerization and tetramerization of tau increased with the increase in heparin incubation time until 48 h. The formation of higher molecular size aggregate was slow during the initial period of heparin incubation until 48 h. Incubation with heparin beyond 48 h converted almost all tau species into the higher molecular size aggregate. Heparin-induced conformational change of tau, as detected by DSS cross-linking of 72- and 83-kDa species, completed within ∼30 min of heparin exposure. In addition to causing aggregation, heparin is known to stimulate tau phosphorylation by various kinases (28Brandt R. Lee G. Teplow D.B. Shalloway D. Abdel-Ghany M. J. Biol.

Using the Sertoli cell line TM4, it was demonstrated that a gene segment of the 5′-untranslated region located between −318 and −237 relative to the translation start site is required for constitutive FasL transcription. Deletion and mutation analysis demonstrate that an Sp1 rather than an NFAT or NFKB-like DNA binding motif present within this region is necessary and sufficient for constitutive FasL gene transcription. Nuclear extracts of Sertoli cells contain Sp1 and Sp3 that specifically binds to the Sp1 motif present in the FasL gene, and overexpression of Sp1 but not Sp3 leads to a further increase of transcription from the FasL promoter-enhancer region. The data presented demonstrates that constitutive FasL gene transcription in Sertoli cells is regulated by Sp1. In addition, it is shown that basal FasL expression in Jurkat T cells is also controlled by Sp1 and this is in contrast to induced FasL expression, which is NFAT-dependent.

Recent cloning of the FasL enhancer-promoter region has enabled investigation of the transcriptional regulation of FasL, with initial studies focusing on the inducible regulation of FasL transcription following T cell activation (8Holtz-Heppelmann C.J.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 4602-4611PubMed Google Scholar). In T cells, Ca2+-dependent signals, via calcineurin, lead to an increase in the nuclear concentration of the transcription factor (NFAT) which binds to the promoter/enhancer region of the FasL gene and increases its transcription (8Holtz-Heppelmann C.J.

However, it remains unknown what regulates basal non-inducible FasL gene transcription, specifically in cells known to constitutively express high levels of FasL and maintain an immune-privileged environment. In this study, we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of FasL in a Sertoli cell line (TM4) that is known to have constitutive FasL expression (10Latinis K.M. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and compared it to Jurkat T cells in which FasL gene transcription can be induced by specific stimuli. Results from this study demonstrate that a segment of the 5′-untranslated region of the FasL gene located between −318 and −237 relative to the translation initiation site is important for constitutive basal FasL gene transcription, and that an Sp1 but not an NFAT or NFKB consensus DNA-binding site within this region is necessary and sufficient for transcription in both Sertoli and Jurkat T cells. In addition, nuclear extracts of Sertoli cells contain high levels of Sp1 and Sp3 that specifically bind to the GGGCGG consensus sequence present in the FasL gene. Overexpression of Sp1 but not Sp3 leads to increased transcription from the FasL promoter region through this specific motif in both Sertoli and Jurkat T cells. This data demonstrates that the basal constitutive FasL transcription is mainly dependent on Sp1 in these different cell types demonstrating that the control of inducible and constitutive FasL gene transcription are mediated by separate transcription factors. The testicular murine Sertoli cell line (TM4) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATTC) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Biowittaker) supplemented with 5% horse serum (Biowittaker), 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Intergen), 1% glutamine, 1% streptomycin, and 1% penicillin. The Jurkat T cell line was purchased from ATCC and cultured in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Intergen), glutamine, and antibiotics as above. Anti-Sp1(PEP2)X, anti-Sp3(D-20)-GX, anti-NFATc(K-18)X, and anti-STAT3(c-20)X antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-HA antibodies were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and unconjugated anti-rat IgG(H+L) antibodies were purchased from Pierce. Plasmids containing FasL promoter deletion mutants were cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (FasL-Luc-0 through FasL-Luc-6) and have been previously described (8Holtz-Heppelmann C.J.

The luciferase reporter gene, pGL2-basic (pGL2-B), was purchased from Promega. Point mutations targeted three separate transcription factor consensus sequences within the FasL promoter region of FasL-Luc-3 and were created using polymerase chain reaction-based techniques as described previously (8Holtz-Heppelmann C.J.

The resultant products were cloned into pGL2-B, and the final constructs sequenced to verify the appropriate nucleotide mutations. The mutations introduced are shown in Fig. 1. The FasL-Luc constructs are shown in Fig. 2. The NFKB-dependent luciferase reporter gene (NFKB-Luc) and the IKBα (S32/36) have been previously described (27McElhinny J.A. MacMorran W.S. Bren G.D.

Bren G.D. Ten R.M. Israel A. Paya C.V. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were scraped off of the flask in cold phosphate-buffered saline, washed in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl), and then lysed two times in buffer A containing protease inhibitors (aprotinin at 0.4 μg/ml, leupeptin at 0.002 mg/ml, pepstatin at 0.8 μg/ml, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 0.175 μg/ml), 100 μmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were pelleted, washed in Buffer A, and the nuclear protein extracted in Buffer C (20 mm Hepes, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors as above). After pelleting the nuclear debris, the supernatant was removed and diluted with twice the volume of Buffer D (20 mm Hepes, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors as above). Protein concentration was calculated using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides were annealed to make double-stranded target DNA by successive incubations: 88 oC for 2 min, 65 oC for 10 min, 37 oC for 10 min, room temperature for 10 min. The DNA was then end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (37 oC for 30 min, 65o for 10 min) and the unincorporated radioactive nucleotides removed on a column of Spectra/GelTM ACA 202 (fractionation range 1,000–15,000) beads (Spectrum). Binding reactions were done by incubating the labeled DNA with nuclear extract in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) at room temperature for 15 min. Reactions using antibodies were performed as above, with a final addition of antibody and incubation on ice for 30 min. The reactions were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5%), the gel dried and exposed to autoradiographic film. Twenty μg of protein from whole Sertoli cell lysates were loaded per well, separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%), and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane by electrophoresis. The membrane was then blocked with 5% milk overnight, incubated with anti-HA antibodies (100 ng/ml for 1 h), anti-rat IgG (H+L) (1:10,000 for 30 min), and horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 for 30 min), and developed using the ECL system (Amersham) for 2 min. Three washes were done between each step, all in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 for 10 min. Gene transfections in Sertoli cells were done in duplicate using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Sertoli cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 0.9 × 105 cells per well, grown for 48 h prior to the addition of DNA suspension, and incubated for 24 h following gene transfection. In all cases, the total amount of DNA in each transfection was kept equal by the addition of control DNA (pcDNA3) where appropriate. The luciferase (Luc) and β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity were read using the Dual-LightTM chemiluminescence system following the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix, Inc.). Briefly, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and total cell extracts prepared in 250 μl of lysis buffer. The luciferase activity of 5 μl of extract was read using a luminometer (Lumat LB9501). The solutions were left at room temperature for 1 h before the β-gal activity was read using the same luminometer. All experiments were repeated at least twice. Reporter gene activity is reported as relative light units which results from the ratio of luciferase units to β-gal units for each data point. Error bars on transfection data represent the standard deviations of duplicate samples. Controls performed in all transfection experiments included transfection of control DNA (pcDNA3) alone, and the empty luciferase reporter vector (pGL2-B) with the TK-β-gal reporter plasmid. In each control case, the luciferase activity was detectable, minimal, and significantly below all other data points. Gene transfections in Jurkat T cells were done using FuGeneTM6 Transfection Reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) as per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA-FuGene mixtures were incubated for 48 h with cells washed in phosphate-buffered saline and split equally for luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays. Luciferase activity was determined using the “Luciferase Assay System” (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. CAT activity was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's instructions. For Jurkat T cells, relative light units were calculated by normalizing the luciferase with the CAT units. To determine which segment(s) of the 5′-untranslated region of the FasL gene is important for transcription in Sertoli cells, these were transfected with the FasL gene promoter constructs outlined in Fig. 2, and activity from the luciferase reporter gene measured. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that transcription from the FasL-Luc-0 construct was detectable, but strong and increasing transcriptional activity was detected from FasL-Luc 1 to 3, with maximal activity provided by the FasL-Luc-3 reporter gene. The transcription activity then dropped sharply, and continued to decrease from FasL-Luc-4 through FasL-Luc-6. These results indicate that an approximate 80-base pair segment of the 5′-untranslated region of the FasL gene located between −318 and −237 relative to the translation initiation site is involved in promoting transcription in TM4 Sertoli cells. This region, specifically that between −280 to −267 base pairs, contains three DNA motifs known to bind the transcription factors Sp1 (GGGCGG), NFAT (GGAAA), and NFKB (GAAACTTCC) (see Fig. 1). It should be noted that the NFKB sequence is an imperfect consensus sequence, and will be referred to as NFKB-like. Although construct FasL-Luc-0 contains the stretch of three transcription factor-binding sites, the transcriptional activity of this reporter gene was barely above background, possibly suggesting the presence of a DNA sequence upstream from −463 to which transcription factors with repressor activity bind. Using the FasL-Luc-3 construct (Fig. 2), point mutations were introduced into each of three transcription factor DNA binding motifs, as shown in Fig.1. These constructs were then transfected into Sertoli cells, and transcription from the FasL gene promoter measured by quantifying the activity of the luciferase reporter genes. The results shown in Fig.4 demonstrate that point mutations introduced into the Sp1 binding motif resulted in the most important reduction of basal transcription from the FasL gene. A less significant reduction was observed when the NFAT or NFKB sites were separately mutated (Fig. 4). Because of the small but detectable drop of the basal FasL gene transcription when the NFKB-like motif was mutated, we investigated whether the combination of mutation of the Sp1, NFAT, and NFKB-like motifs would be additive. As shown in Fig. 4, the combined mutation of these cis-acting motifs decreases only moderately the basal FasL gene transcription beyond that observed with the single Sp1 mutation. This data suggests that the Sp1 cis-acting motif alone is dominant in conferring the basal FasL transcription in Sertoli cells. Nevertheless, and because of the reported interaction between Sp1 and NFKB (30Hirano F. Tanaka H. Hirano Y. Hiramoto M. Handa H. Makino I. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we intended to further confirm or exclude the role of the NFKB-like motif as one that may confer basal FasL gene transcription independently from Sp1. For this, we tested the role of an IKBα expression vector (in which Ser32/36 have been mutated to alanine) which has previously been shown to inhibit both basal and inducible NFKB activity (28Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sertoli cells were transfected with the FasL-Luc-3 wt or ΔNFKB construct together or not with the IKBα 32/36A expression vector and the TK-β-gal expression vector to normalize for transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig.5 A, the expression of IKBα 32/36A does not interfere with the basal activity of the FasL-Luc-3 wt or ΔNFKB. However, in the same transfection experiment in Sertoli cells, IKBα 32/36A interfered with both the basal and inducible (tumor necrosis factor) transcriptional activity of a NFKB-Luc reporter gene (Fig. 5 B). Altogether, this data implies that the Sp1 cis-acting motif controls the basal activity of FasL in Sertoli cells.Figure 5The NFKB-like site in the FasL promoter does not contribute to FasL expression in Sertoli cells by binding NFKB. A, Sertoli cells were co-transfected with either the FasL-Luc-3 wild-type reporter construct or with mutations in the NFKB-like DNA binding motif (FasL-Luc3-ΔNFKB; see Fig. 1), and the IKBα Δ32/36A (IKBα) expression vector. B,Sertoli cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing three NFκB sites (NFKB-Luc) and IKBα 32/36A (IKBα).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After demonstrating that the Sp1 DNA motif is required to convey basal transcription from the FasL promoter, we wanted to identify the composition of nuclear proteins that interact with this cis-acting motif. Using EMSA (Fig.6 A, lanes 1 and 5), we observed that nuclear extracts from Sertoli cells contain three protein complexes that bind an oligonucleotide which contains the Sp1, NFAT, and NFKB DNA binding motifs and encompasses −288 to −263 base pairs relative to the translation initiation site (Fig. 1). These DNA binding complexes were further analyzed using specific antibodies directed to Sp1, Sp3, NFAT, NFKB, and STAT-3. The results shown in Fig.5 A demonstrate that the slower migrating protein complex (a) contains Sp1, while the two faster migrating complexes (b and c) contain Sp3. We did not demonstrate what constitutes the difference in mobility seen between complexes b and c. None of the complexes contained NFAT, STAT-3, or NFKB (NFKB; data not shown). To confirm that Sp1 and related family members constitute the major portion of nuclear protein binding to the oligonucleotide encompassing bases −288 to −263 relative to the FasL translation start site, Sertoli cell nuclear extracts were incubated with three separate oligonucleotides, each containing point mutations in one of the three transcription factor DNA binding motifs: ΔSp1, ΔNFAT, and ΔNFKB (see Fig. 1). When the oligonucleotides are used in EMSA (Fig.6 B), only mutations introduced into the Sp1 cis-acting motif eliminated DNA binding of the protein complex containing Sp proteins (Fig. 6 B, panel 1). In addition, incubation with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide containing mutations in either NFAT of NFKB competed away all DNA binding activity of the protein complexes bound to the 32P-labeled wild type −288 to −263 FasL oligonucleotide. An excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide containing mutations in the Sp1 site did not compete with the DNA binding of the protein complex (Fig. 6 B, panel 2). These results indicate that the nuclear protein complex present in Sertoli cells, which binds to the putative SP1 cis-acting sequence, contains at least Sp1 and Sp3. After showing that the Sp1 cis-acting DNA motif is necessary for the constitutive transcription of the FasL promoter in Sertoli cells, and that Sp1 and Sp3 present in nuclear extracts are major components of the nuclear protein complex that binds to this motif, we next investigated whether overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 would modify the transcriptional regulation of the FasL promoter. Expression of Sp1 and Sp3 in Sertoli cells was first verified by performing transient transfections with Sp1 and Sp3 expression vectors in Sertoli cells followed by analysis of the transfected cell lysates in immunoblotting assays with anti-Sp1 or Sp3 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7 A, significant levels of both Sp1 and Sp3 can be detected. Fig. 7 B shows the effect of Sp1 and Sp3 overexpression on the transcriptional activity of the FasL promoter in Sertoli cells. Cells were transfected with the FasL-Luc-3 or FasL-Luc-3-ΔSp1 constructs plus either the Sp1 or Sp3 expression vector, or both. The results demonstrate that overexpression of Sp1 alone leads to increased transcription from the wild-type FasL promoter, but not from the FasL promoter containing the mutated Sp1 cis-acting sequence. Overexpression of Sp3 alone has essentially no transcriptional effects on the wild type or mutated FasL promoter, and its co-expression with Sp1 does not modify the observed effects of Sp1 alone. These results demonstrate that Sp1 alone is sufficient to enhance the basal transcription from the FasL promoter through the Sp1 cis-acting sequence in Sertoli cells. To investigate the universality of the cis-acting Sp1 site in controlling the basal transcriptional activity of the FasL gene, we studied an unrelated cell line. Jurkat T cells were co-transfected with the FasL-Luc-3 wt or FasL-Luc-3 ΔSp1 reporter constructs together or not with Sp1 or Sp3 expression vectors and a TK-CAT to normalize for transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig.8, the basal transcriptional activity from the FasL promoter is decreased by mutations in the Sp1 DNA binding motif (columns 1 and 4). In addition, overexpression of Sp1 substantially increases transcription (column 2), while overexpression of Sp3 increases transcription to a lesser degree (column 3). We have demonstrated that an Sp1 consensus sequence is necessary for basal transcription from the FasL promoter, and that Sp1 alone is sufficient to drive transcription from the promoter in vivo. The consensus sequence for Sp1 (GGGCGG) has been identified in the promoter regions of a variety of genes although its role in gene regulation is not understood (31Lania L. Majello B. DeLuca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The site is known to bind Sp1, an approximately 100 kDa, zinc-requiring transcription factor, and binding results in increased transcription of the associated gene (32Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 33Courey A.J. Tjian R.

Sp1 is essential for development in mice, as Sp1 −/− embryos have retarded growth and die early in gestation (35Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Some studies have suggested that Sp1 is involved in cell differentiation (36Suzuki M. Oda E. Nakajima T. Sekiya S. Oda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3010-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as it has been found in highest levels in hematopoetic stem cells, fetal cells, and spermatids (35Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Others have speculated that it is a major transcription factor for housekeeping genes, as the Sp1 consensus sequence is commonly found in the promoter region of these genes (37Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 743-771Google Scholar). However, recent studies and our own data indicate that many mammalian gene types are controlled by Sp1, including genes for structural proteins, metabolic enzymes, cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, growth factors, surface receptors, and others (31Lania L. Majello B. DeLuca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 37Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 743-771Google Scholar). Our report adds the FasL gene to this growing list of relevant genes regulated by Sp1. In Sertoli cells, Sp1 alone is sufficient to induce constitutive transcription from the FasL promoter, while in several other systems studied, Sp1 acts co-operatively with other transcription factors such as AP-1 (38Noti J.D.

In the human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat promoter region, Sp1 has been shown to interact with an NFKB site and controls basal promoter activity (30Hirano F. Tanaka H. Hirano Y. Hiramoto M. Handa H. Makino I. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although an imperfect NFKB site is present in the FasL promoter, its significance for gene regulation in Sertoli cells is unclear. Our data show that although mutations in this site slightly decreased transcription from the FasL promoter, it is not due to inhibition of NFKB binding to the site, and there appears to be no significant functional interaction between Sp1 and NFKB. We have shown that Sp3 is present in the protein complexes bound to the Sp1 cis-acting motif in the FasL gene promoter, but it does not appear to directly affect basal transcription in Sertoli or Jurkat T cells. In other studies, Sp3 has been shown to function as either an inhibitor of gene transcription (it can compete with Sp1 for binding to the consensus sequence (44Hagan G. Muller S. Beato M. Susuke G.

It will be interesting to understand the upstream regulation of Sp1, and preliminary investigations have been done using other gene systems. The data indicates that dysfunctions of Sp1 inhibitors result in increased Sp1 activity and increased gene expression. Inhibitors identified include Sp1 inhibitor (Sp1-I), which binds and inactivates Sp1 (48Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Harrison J. Molloy P.L. Gene. 1997; 195: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Sp3 and Sp1-I can occur by the retinoblastoma protein (48Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J.

Inducible FasL expression within T lymphocytes has been well characterized and plays a major role in maintaining peripheral homeostasis of T cells by limiting the expansion of proliferating cells during a normal immune response (5Nagata S. Goldstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3979) Google Scholar, 6Suda T. Takahashi T. Goldstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). This process is mediated by the transcription factor, NFAT, as previously shown by our group and others (8Holtz-Heppelmann C.J. Algreciras A. Badley A.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Latinis K.M. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Inducible FasL also functions as a cytolytic effector molecule for cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells (54Kagi D. Vignaux F. Ledermann B. Burki K. Depraetere V. Nagata S. Hentgartner H. Goldstein P. Science. 1994; 265: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar, 55Lowin B. Hahne M. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Nature. 1994; 370: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). However, the significance of constitutive FasL expression by both immune and non-immune cells is less well understood. It is known that constitutive FasL expression by cells in immune-privileged sites and transplanted grafts will protect these tissues from elimination by the immune surveillance system (56Korbutt G.S. Elliott J.F. Rajotte R.V. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 57Lau H.T. Yu M. Fontana A. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The constitutive FasL expressed in tissues not considered to be immune privileged may play a role in the normal homeostasis of these tissues also (58Galle P.R. Hoffman W.J. Walczak H. Schaller H. Otto G. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Runkel L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 182: 1223-1230Crossref Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 59Lee J.W. Richburg J.H. Younkin S.C. Boekelheide K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2081-2088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the constitutive expression of FasL by macrophages may be involved in controlling T cell homeostasis and play a role in human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis. Another area in which the role of constitutive FasL expression is currently being addressed is that of malignancy. Multiple types of malignancies constitutively express FasL (17Saas P. Walker P.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the functional relevance of this expression has not been characterized, FasL may play a major role in the invasiveness and metastatic capabilities of such tumors. Understanding the constitutive transcriptional regulation of the FasL gene in such tumors should help to identify specific transcription factors that are relevant for understanding these malignant processes. We have shown here that both the constitutive expression of FasL in Sertoli cells and basal FasL transcription in T cell is controlled by Sp1. Thus, it is tempting to propose that constitutive expression of FasL in general may be controlled by Sp1, while inducible transcription may be at least partially controlled by NFAT. This would be consistent with prior data showing NFAT to be critical for the inducible transcription of many other cytokine genes (60Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Future investigations of FasL gene transcription in additional cell types should clarify this issue.

The histidine ligation was further examined by using the cobalt protoporphyrin IX-substituted enzyme. The Co2+-substituted enzyme exhibited EPR signals of a broad g⊥;1 component and a g∥;1 component with a poorly resolved triplet of 14N superhyperfine splittings, which was indicative of the histidine ligation.

The binding of NO to the Co2+-enzyme markedly stimulated the cGMP production by forming the five-coordinate NO complex. We found that N3− elicited the activation of the ferric enzyme by yielding five-coordinate high spin N3− heme. These results indicated that the activation of the enzymes was initiated by NO binding to the metals and proceeded via breaking of the metal-histidine bonds, and suggested that the iron-histidine bond in the ferric enzyme heme was broken by N3−binding.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14668-14674Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Based on the result, they argued that the stoichiometry was actually 2 hemes/heterodimer, with each subunit binding one equivalent of heme at a homologous site between two subunits (18Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14668-14674Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this context, it is noted that a site-directed mutagenesis study raises a new issue for the heme coordination (19Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G.

This mutagenesis study aimed at the identification of a heme axial ligand strongly suggested that the binding domain of protoheme IX located only in the smaller subunit, the β-subunit, and that the histidine residue at the 105-position of the β-subunit was an axial ligand of the enzyme heme. The ligation of the histidine residue at the 105-position to the heme iron was confirmed by a site-directed mutagenesis study, in which the β-subunit fragment consisting of residues 1–385 contained a stoichiometric amount of heme (20Zhao Y. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15959-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), while the β-subunit fragment with H105A mutation was heme-deficient (21Zhao Y. Schelvis P.M.

Although these results demonstrated that the histidine residue conserved only among the β-subunits was the heme binding site, there was no evidence for the heme binding site in the α-subunit.

Evidence for the formation of five-coordinate NO complex was also obtained by using partially purified, reconstituted enzyme preparations (25Burstyn J.N. Yu A.E. Dierks E.A. Hawkins B.K. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5896-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Yu A.E. Hu S. Spiro T.G. Burstyn J.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4117-4118Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Hence, the breaking of the heme-proximal ligand bond upon NO binding to the enzyme heme was proposed to be a trigger for the activation of the enzyme, as has been hypothesized by Traylor and Sharma (27Traylor T.G. Sharma V.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2847-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The spectroscopic finding for the ligation of a histidine residue at the proximal position has been obtained by a resonance Raman study (24Deinum G. Stone J.R. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Deinum et al. (24Deinum G. Stone J.R. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) assigned the 204-cm−1 Raman band to the iron-histidine stretching vibration based on analogy with that of other hemoproteins. This result was a first demonstration for the weak iron-histidine bond in sGC, but the assignment of the Fe-histidine vibration was incomplete for lack of an isotope shift experiment such as 57Fe substitution. Although a resonance Raman spectroscopy was an important spectroscopic probe for the analysis of properties of the iron-proximal base bond, the use was usually limited to ferrous high spin enzyme heme. In contrast, an EPR technique provided structural information for the metal-axial base bond of six-coordinate ferrous NO hemoproteins (28Kon H. Kataoka N.

The Co2+ derivatives that were proved to retain close structural homology to the native iron hemoproteins by x-ray crystallography (38Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Dickinson L.C. Chien J.C.W. J. Mol.

In the present work, we aimed to identify a histidine residue as the proximal ligand of the heme and to examine the nature of the metal-histidine bond of sGC by an EPR method. To take advantage of a EPR spectroscopy as a structural probe, we have prepared the six-coordinate NO complex and the Co2+-substituted derivative of sGC. The EPR findings provided firm spectroscopic evidence for the histidine ligation at the proximal position of metal. Moreover, we found that the EPR features of the NO complex and the Co2+ derivative closely resembled those of the corresponding form of α-subunits of hemoglobin, showing the presence of tension on the iron-histidine bond. We also obtained EPR evidence that the N3− binding to the ferric enzyme heme formed presumably a five-coordinate high spin N3− heme. Fresh bovine lung (4 kg) was minced and homogenized with a Waring blender in 12 liters of 50 mm TEA buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 55 mm mercaptoethanol (buffer A). Throughout the purification, these protease inhibitors and mercaptoethanol were included in the buffer unless otherwise stated. After the homogenate was centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 20 min, 1.2 kg of DEAE-cellulose A-500 (Seikagaku Kogyo) equilibrated with buffer A was added to the supernatant. The slurry was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resin was collected by sedimentation. Subsequently, the resin was washed three times with buffer A and was poured into a column. The enzyme was eluted with a 3.5-liter linear NaCl gradient of 0–0.35m in buffer A. After active fractions were pooled, solid ammonium sulfate (0.29 g/ml) was added. The precipitate collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min was dissolved in 200 ml of 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 55 mm mercaptoethanol. The sample was washed with the phosphate buffer by using a Minitan system (Millipore Corp.) to remove ammonium sulfate. Then the enzyme was applied to the column of Matrex Blue A (Amicon) equilibrated with 40 mm phosphate buffer described above and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1m KCl gradient. The pooled enzyme was applied to a ceramic hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad). The enzyme was eluted by increasing phosphate concentration from 0 to 0.45 m at pH 7.6 containing 55 mm mercaptoethanol and the protease inhibitors except for EDTA. The concentrated sample was further purified with a Superdex 200-pg HPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Then fractions with the cyclase activity were applied to an 80-ml column of GTP-Sepharose 4B with a 12-atom spacer attached through ribose hydroxyl (40Barker R. Trayer I.P. Hill R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 34: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The column was exhaustively washed to remove contaminated proteins with 25 mm Tricine-NaOH buffer, pH 7.6. The enzyme was eluted with a 1-liter gradient running from 0 to 0. 15 m NaCl. The fractions with a specific activity over 8000 nmol/min/mg of protein in the presence of NO were pooled. Then the sample was finally purified to an apparently homogenous state with a Protein Pak G-DEAE HPLC column (Waters). The overall yield was about 10%. The resultant homogenous enzyme was stored in 50 mmTEA buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol and 5 mm DTT at −80 °C until use. Ignarroet al. (17Ignarro L.J. Adams J.B. Horwitz P.M. Wood K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4997-5002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported a method to prepare the apoenzyme by lowering pH to 5.7. We attempted to prepare the apoenzyme by this method, but the recovery of the Co2+-substituted enzyme was very low at the final purification step. We tested the heme depletion as a function of pH and found that the heme in sGC was depleted by the DEAE cellulose chromatography under alkaline conditions. In brief, the supernatant fraction of homogenized tissue described above was adjusted to pH 8.5, and DEAE cellulose A-500 equilibrated with 50 mmTEA buffer at pH 8.5 containing protease inhibitors was poured to the supernatant. The enzyme was eluted by a linear gradient of 0–0.35m NaCl. The fractions with cyclase activity that was assayed in the presence of protoporphyrin IX were further purified by GTP-agarose and Superdex 200-pg columns under the conditions described above. The apoenzyme was pooled and reconstituted with Co2+protoporphyrin IX under anaerobic conditions. The remaining purification steps were the same as those used for the native enzyme purification. The enzyme Co2+ porphyrin-substituted by our method exhibited essentially the same optical and EPR spectral properties as the Co2+-substituted enzyme, which was obtained by the method of Ignarro et al. (17Ignarro L.J. Adams J.B. Horwitz P.M. Wood K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4997-5002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu MPS-2000 or a Perkin-Elmer Lamda 18 spectrophotometer at room and subzero temperatures. The temperature of the cuvette holder was controlled with thermomodule elements. The buffer systems used were 50 mm TEA buffer (pH 7.6) containing 5% glycerol and the same buffer containing 40% ethylene glycol for room and subzero temperature measurements, respectively. Other details were described in the figure legends. EPR spectra were measured on a Varian E-12 X-band EPR spectrometer with 100-kHz field modulation. An Oxford flow cryostat (ESR-900) was used for liquid helium temperature measurements. The microwave frequency was calibrated with a microwave frequency counter (Takeda Riken, model TR 5212), and the magnetic field strength was determined by the nuclear magnetic resonance of water protons. Accuracy of g values was ±0.01 in the low magnetic field and ±0.005 in the high field. Other details were as described elsewhere (41Masuya F. Tsubaki M. Makino R. Hori H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). NO complexes for EPR measurements were prepared in buffer containing 5% glycerol at −5 °C or in buffer containing 40% ethylene glycol at −24 °C as follows. The enzyme solution was transferred to a septum-capped EPR tube and flushed with oxygen-free argon gas for 10 min. Then NO gas previously washed with 1 n NaOH or an aliquot of SNAP solution was introduced to the tube with a gas-tight syringe. The formations of NO complexes in five- and six-coordinate states were ensured by directly measuring the optical spectrum of the sample in the EPR tube at −5 or −24 °C. The ferric enzyme was prepared by adding a 2-fold excess of ferricyanide to the DTT-free ferrous enzyme, where DTT in the enzyme solution was removed by a Superdex 200HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) HPLC column. For EPR measurements, the residual ferricyanide was freed of the solution by passing through a Superdex 200HR HPLC column. The ferric enzyme was converted to N3−complexes by adding a desired amount of NaN3. The EPR spectra of ferric N3− complex were measured at 5 or 15 K. The NO binding to the ferrous enzyme was analyzed by a Photal stopped flow spectrophotometer, model RA-401, equipped with a photodiode array detector. The buffer solution in reservoirs was bubbled with oxygen-free argon for 10 min, and then the catalytic amount of glucose oxidase and catalase and 2 mmglucose was added to assure anaerobic conditions. The enzyme and an aliquot of NO-saturated solution were then added to the buffer solution under a constant stream of argon. The resonance Raman spectra were measured with a JASCO NR-1800 spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Princeton Instruments). Excitation wavelengths were 413.1- and 406.7-nm lines from a Krypton ion laser (Coherent, Innova 90). Calibration of the Raman spectrometer was performed by using indene. The enzyme activity during the purification was measured in a reaction mixture containing 2 mm GTP, 5 mm DTT, 3 mmMgCl2, and an appropriate amount of the enzyme solution in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 40 mm TEA buffer, pH 7.4. When desired, 1 mm isobutylmethylxantine was added to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.2 mm SNAP and conducted at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 30% acetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 rpm, and cGMP was quantitated with a C18 HPLC column at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min of 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10% methanol. The activity of the homogenous enzyme was assayed under the same condition as that described above, except that the concentration of GTP was increased to 4 mm. The activation by NO was performed in a septum-capped sample tube. The assay mixture in the tube was flushed with a purified argon, and the reaction was started by the addition of 30 μl of saturated NO solution with a gas-tight syringe. For the activation by CO, the reaction mixture was saturated with CO gas prior to the addition of the enzyme. Reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out by using 9% acrylamide running gel. Protein was visualized with a silver stain method (Daiichi Chemical Co.). GTP and cGMP were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. Research grade NO was obtained from Takachiho Chemical Co.S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine was purchased from DOJINDO or ALEXIS. Other chemicals, purchased from Nacalai Tesque Co., were of highest commercial grade and were used without further purification. The homogenous enzyme exhibited a basal activity of 98 nmol/min/mg of protein at 37 °C in the presence of Mg2+. The activity increased to 26,811 nmol/min/mg of protein upon the addition of NO, while it increased to 650 nmol/min/mg of protein upon the addition of CO. An addition of protoporphyrin IX (2.4 μm) slightly increased the activity (580 nmol/min/mg of protein). The enzyme preparation stimulated by a combined addition of protoporphyrin and NO exhibited an activity (25,560 nmol/min/mg of protein) rather lower than the NO-stimulated activity. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses indicated that the enzyme was a heterodimeric protein consisting of an α-subunit of 75 kDa and a β-subunit of 71 kDa. The enzyme contained 0.97 ± 0.04 protoheme IX/heterodimer, in which protein was determined by the modified biuret method of Yonetani (42Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1680-1688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and the heme content was determined by the pyridine hemochromogen method (43Paul K.G. Theorell H. Akesson A. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1284-1287Crossref Google Scholar). When protein was determined by the Bradford protein assay, essentially the same heme stoichiometry was obtained (0.95 ± 0.03). The cyclase activity per heme, defined as turnover number (μmol of cGMP/min/μmol of heme) was 3800 min−1at 37 °C in the presence of NO. The ferric enzyme exhibited a Soret band at 390 nm (εmm 103), which was indicative of the five-coordinate high spin state (data not shown). The ferrous enzyme, prepared by adding a slight excess of Na2S2O4 to the ferric enzyme under anaerobic conditions, exhibited the Soret maximum at 431 nm (εmm 105). The optical spectrum of the enzyme reduced by Na2S2O4 was identical with that of the ferrous enzyme as isolated in the presence of mercaptoethanol. An anaerobic addition of SNAP or NO to the ferrous enzyme yielded the five-coordinate NO complex with the Soret maximum at 400 nm (εmm 75). These optical and EPR spectral properties of the ferric enzyme (see Figs. 6 and 8) agreed with previous results (18Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14668-14674Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Zhao Y. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15959-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) but significantly differed from the result obtained by using a partially purified reconstituted enzyme (25Burstyn J.N. Yu A.E. Dierks E.A. Hawkins B.K. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5896-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Deinum et al. (24Deinum G. Stone J.R. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) pointed out that the partially purified reconstituted enzyme preparation had a different heme environment from the native enzyme.Figure 8EPR spectra of ferric sGC and its ferric azide complex.

EPR spectra were taken at a microwave power of 5 milliwatts and by 100-kHz modulation with 0.5-mT width, and the enzyme concentrations were 75 μm as heme. Throughout these EPR measurements, 50 mm TEA buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When the ferrous enzyme was mixed with SNAP at −24 °C in the presence of 40% ethylene glycol used as an antifreeze, a new spectral species with a sharp Soret band at 419 nm and 544- and 579-nm bands in the visible region was produced (Fig.1 A). The peak positions closely agreed with those of the six-coordinate NO complex of hemoglobin (44Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam and London, 1971: 19Google Scholar), suggesting that the new species was six-coordinate ferrous NO complex. By raising the temperature to −15 °C, the species fully converted to the five-coordinate ferrous NO complex with 400-nm Soret maximum, giving clear isosbestic points (Fig.1 A, inset). The coordination state of the new species was examined by an EPR method at 35 K. When the new species, prepared in EPR tube at pH 7.6 and −24 °C, was immediately frozen by immersing into liquid nitrogen, the EPR signal of the new species was negligibly small in the spectrum, where the three-line signal of five-coordinate NO complex was predominant. We thought that the new species was rapidly degraded to the five-coordinate NO complex upon freezing. The examination of stability of the new species as a function of pH at −24 °C revealed that the species was more stable at pH 8.6 than at pH 7.6. As expected, the EPR spectrum of the species prepared at pH 8.6 displayed a new EPR signal at g = 1.979 besides the three-line signal of the five-coordinate NO complex (b in Fig. 1 B). The new EPR species was not a modified form of the five-coordinate NO complex produced by the effect of pH or the binding of antifreeze, since the changes in pH from 7.6 to 8.6, the changes in the antifreeze from ethylene glycol to glycerol, or changes in the concentration of antifreeze did not alter the EPR spectrum of the five-coordinate NO complex. The EPR signal of the new species was obtained by subtracting the three-line signal of the five-coordinate species (a in Fig. 1 B) from the spectrum of trace b. The resultant spectrum (c in Fig. 1 B) was typical of a six-coordinate ferrous NO complex as indicated by a triplet superhyperfine splitting of 14NO in the central resonance signal around g = 2. This was the first clear identification of a six-coordinate ferrous NO complex of sGC. Superhyperfine structure of a triplet of triplets in the gz region, which was indication of the ligation of axial ligand with 14N nucleus, a histidine residue (29Yonetani T. Yamamoto H. Erman J.E. Leigh Jr., J.S. Reed G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2447-2455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was unclear in the spectrum due to the low signal quality. The formation of the six-coordinate NO complex was examined at room temperature by monitoring the absorbance at 400, 419, and 430 nm under stopped flow conditions (Fig.2 A). It was particularly noted that the magnitude of the absorbance changes at 419, 400, and 430 nm was different from that expected. For instance, if the five-coordinate NO complex is assumed to be directly produced in the reaction between the ferrous enzyme and NO, the absorbance decrease at 430 nm must be much larger than the increase at 400 nm, indicative of the formation of the five-coordinate NO complex. However, the absorbance change at 430 nm was smaller than that at 400 nm (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, the absorbance decrease at 419 nm was unexpectedly large. The most reasonable interpretation was that the six-coordinate NO complex was produced within a dead time of the apparatus (about 2.5 ms), and then converted to the five-coordinate NO complex. To confirm the formation of the six-coordinate NO complex within a dead time of the apparatus, the reaction was analyzed by a rapid scan spectrophotometer (Fig.2 B). The spectrum taken at 4 ms after mixing agreed with that of the six-coordinate NO complex shown in Fig. 1 A and was converted to that of the five-coordinate NO complex with the Soret band at 400 nm through one set of isosbestic points. The time course at 419 nm (Fig. 2 A) obeyed that of a first order reaction with a rate constant of 38 s−1. The conversion rates did not show significant pH-dependent changes between pH 7.0 and 8.6 at 15 °C (Fig. 2 A,inset), being different from the above described results at −24 °C in the presence of ethylene glycol. The finding that the six-coordinate NO complex formation was completed within the dead time indicated that the binding rate of NO to the ferrous enzyme,i.e. the formation rate of the six-coordinate NO complex, was much faster than 1 × 107m−1 s−1. These results together were the first clear evidence of the formation of the six-coordinate NO complex. Apoenzyme used for the reconstitution with Co2+ protoporphyrin IX exhibited the basal and NO-stimulated activities of 38 and 165 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively.

AR protein expression increased severalfold in human liver cells after 1 day of exposure to 100 units/ml TNF-α. An increase in AR transcripts was also observed in human liver cells after 3 h of TNF-α treatment, reaching a maximum level of 11-fold at 48 h. Among the three inflammatory cytokines: TNF-α, interleukin-1, and interferon-γ, TNF-α (100 units/ml) gave the most induction of AR. Differences in the pattern of AR induction were observed in human liver, lens, and retinal pigment epithelial cells with increasing concentrations of TNF-α. A similar pattern of AR promoter response was observed between TNF-α and osmotically stressed human liver cells. The deletion of the osmotic response element (ORE) abolished the induction by TNF-α and osmotic stress. A point mutation that converts ORE to a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) sequence abolished the osmotic response but maintained the TNF-α response. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays showed two NF-κB proteins, p50 and p52, capable of binding ORE sequence, and gel shift Western assay detected NF-κB proteins p50 and p65 in the ORE complex. Inhibitors of NF-κB signaling, lactacystin, and MG132 abolished the AR promoter response to TNF-α."

Two promoters have been isolated previously for the GHR gene: the P1 promoter that drives liver-specific expression, and the P2 promoter that drives ubiquitous expression.

The P3 promoter was able to drive the expression of a luciferase reporter gene in cell lines Hep G2, PLC/PRF/5, and BHK-21. In vivo, the P3 promoter initiated transcription from two major sites in exon 1C of the GHR gene in many tissues. In the adult bovine liver, the P3-transcribed GHR mRNA represented only 10% of the total GHR mRNA pool. In non-hepatic tissues such as kidney, skeletal muscle, mammary gland, and uterus, P3-transcribed GHR mRNA represented 30–40% of the total GHR mRNA pool. Within the bovine GHR gene, the P3 promoter was located immediately downstream from the P2 promoter. In transfected cells, the P2 promoter served as an enhancer for the P3 promoter.

The structural organization of the GHR gene, however, is only known for the human. The human GHR gene is composed of 10 exons and spans 87 kb from exon 2 to exon 10. The translation start codon (AUG) is located in exon 2, and transcription is initiated from exon 1 (15Godowski P.J. Leung D.W. Meacham L.R Galgani J.P. Hellmiss R. Keret R. Rotwein P.S. Parks J.S. Laron Z. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8083-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Cloning of GHR cDNAs in various species has revealed that the GHR cDNA are heterogeneous in their 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) (18Leung D.W. Spencer S.A Cachianes G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C.

DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and that alternative 5′-UTRs are spliced onto a common splice site 11 bp upstream from the translation initiating codon AUG in exon 2. This has led to the hypothesis that the transcription of the GHR gene is controlled by multiple promoters in exon 1. Consistent with this hypothesis, a liver-specific GHR promoter (P1) has been isolated in various species including sheep (25O'Mahoney J.V. Brandon M.R. Adams T.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 101: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), mouse (26Menon R.K. Stephan D.A. Singh M. Morris Jr., S.M. Zou L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8851-8859Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and human (27Zou L. Burmeister L.A. Sperling M.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1771-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The P1 promoter drives the expression of GHR in the liver of postnatal animals. A second GHR promoter (P2) has also been isolated in sheep and appears to drive the expression of GHR in various tissues including liver (13Adams T.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, transcription from multiple promoters probably represents an important mechanism controlling the amount and tissue specificity of GHR gene expression.In this paper, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel promoter for the bovine GHR gene. Initially, we identified 5′-end sequences for the bovine GHR mRNA in the uterus in an attempt to isolate GHR with an NH2-terminal extended extracellular domain that acts as a unique receptor for bovine placental lactogen. This strategy was implemented because the bovine uterus has high affinity binding sites for bovine placental lactogen, and these binding sites are antigenically similar to the GHR (28Byatt J.C. Collier R.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 210: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), we isolated three new 5′-UTRs for the bovine GHR cDNA from uterus. However, RNase protection analysis (RPA) showed that the new 5′-UTRs were expressed in many other tissues including uterus. Cloning and transient transfection analysis of the genomic region corresponding to these 5′-UTRs have defined a third promoter (designated P3) for the bovine GHR gene.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we initially isolated three new 5′-UTRs for the bovine GHR mRNA from bovine uterine total RNA by using RACE (Fig.1, A and B). Expression of two of the 5′-UTRs, 1C2 and 1C3, was detected by RPA in various tissues including uterus (Figs. 3 and 4). Cloning of the corresponding GHR genomic region (Fig.5) and subsequent transfection analysis (Fig. 7) defined a new promoter (P3) that initiated the transcription of these 5′-UTRs from different sites in exon 1C (Fig. 5). Isolation of a third promoter for the GHR gene adds to the complexity of the structural organization of the GHR regulatory region and the molecular mechanisms for the regulation of GHR gene expression.Use of alternative promoters to initiate transcription has been demonstrated as a strategy to achieve developmental and tissue-specific expression of many genes including IGF-II (33van Dijk M.A. van Schaik F.M.

The first promoter, termed P1, was originally isolated in sheep (25O'Mahoney J.V. Brandon M.R. Adams T.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 101: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and later in mouse (26Menon R.K. Stephan D.A. Singh M. Morris Jr., S.M. Zou L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8851-8859Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), cattle (29Heap D. Lucy M.C. Collier R.J. Boyd C.K. Warren W.C. J. Anim.

Sperling M.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1771-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The P1 promoter is liver-specific. The second promoter, termed P2, was only isolated in sheep (13Adams T.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but its transcripts were also present in cattle (21Heap D. Collier R.J. Boyd C.K. Lucy M.C. Domest. Anim. Endocrinol. 1996; 13: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Lucy M.C. Boyd C.K. Koenigsfeld A.T. Okamura C.S. J. Dairy Sci. 1998; 81: 1889-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and humans (23Pekhletsky R.I. Chernov B.K. Rubtsov P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The P2 promoter appears to be a ubiquitous promoter that governs the expression of the GHR gene in various tissues including liver. The new GHR promoter, named P3, isolated in the present study, appears to be a second ubiquitous promoter for the bovine GHR gene. The evidence for this conclusion included that P3-derived 5′-UTRs were detected in all bovine tissues examined (Fig.3) and that P3 was able to drive the expression of a reporter gene in both hepatic and non-hepatic cell lines (Fig. 7).Although liver is the primary tissue for the expression of GHR, the activity of the P3 promoter seems to be more important in non-hepatic tissues. In the liver of adult animals, the P3-derived GHR transcripts represented only a small portion (11%) of the total GHR mRNA (Table II), whereas the majority of the GHR mRNA was transcribed from the liver-specific P1 promoter. In non-hepatic tissues, GHR transcripts generated from the P3 promoter represented about 30–40% of the total GHR mRNA pool (Table II). Most, if not all, of the remaining GHR transcripts are probably transcribed from a second ubiquitous promoter, P2. Exon 1C-derived GHR 5′-UTRs (Fig. 3) and exon 1B-derived 5′-UTR (22Lucy M.C. Boyd C.K. Koenigsfeld A.T. Okamura C.S. J. Dairy Sci. 1998; 81: 1889-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) 2H. Jiang and M. C. Lucy, unpublished result. are expressed in a similar pattern of tissue distribution: ubiquitous but with higher amounts in uterus, liver, muscle, kidney, and mammary gland than in other tissues. The consistency of the relative expression of 1C- and 1B-derived GHR mRNA across tissues was also demonstrated by the similar ratios of 1C-derived GHR mRNA in the total GHR mRNA pool across tissues in pregnant and non-pregnant animals, and in adult and fetal animals (Table II and Fig. 4). This suggests that the activities of P3 and P2 promoters might be co-regulated. The co-regulation mechanism of P3 and P2 promoters, which together generate most of the GHR transcripts in non-hepatic tissues, is consistent with the wide ranging actions of the GH–IGF-I axis in stimulating cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation in multiple tissues (8Billestrup N. Nielsen J.H. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 883-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nguyen A.P.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3296-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).The P3 promoter was located 700 bp downstream from exon 1B in the bovine GHR gene (Fig. 5). The physical proximity of promoter P3 to P2 allows for an interaction between the two promoters as well as the co-regulation of their activities. The transient transfection analyses demonstrated that inclusion of the upstream P2 promoter region in the P3 promoter-reporter construct increased the activity of the P3 promoter (Fig. 7). This result indicated that the P2 promoter may serve as an enhancer for the P3 promoter, or that enhancer(s) for the P2 promoter may be shared by the P3 promoter. A binding site (CCAAT) for ubiquitous factor CTF/NF-1 and several SP1 sites (GGGCGG) are located in the proximal region of the P2 promoter. Perhaps the CTF/NF-1 and SP1 binding sites constitute a ubiquitous enhancer for both promoters. Similar mechanisms for co-regulation of two ubiquitous promoters were reported for the human aldolase gene (38Concordet J.P. Maire P. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Whether this mechanism applies to the bovine GHR gene remains to be verified.Although P3-derived GHR transcripts were ubiquitously expressed (Fig.3), differential regulation of P3 activity between tissues cannot be excluded. Greater expression of 1C-derived 5′-UTRs in tissues such as liver, muscle, uterus, and kidney than in other tissues such as lung, heart, ovary, and brain (Fig. 3) indicates that the P3 promoter may be controlled by constitutive as well as tissue-specific transcription factors. Previous studies have reported that the GHR mRNA in kidney (39Chen N.Y. Chen W.Y. Kopchick J.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1988-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and in brain (40Bennett P.A. Levy A. Carmignac D.F. Robinson I.C. Lightman S.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3891-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (predominately P2- and P3-transcribed 5′-UTRs) was regulated differentially by GH and steroids from that in liver (predominately P1-transcribed 5′-UTR). In the present study, the levels of 1C-derived GHR mRNA and the total GHR mRNA in uterus and mammary gland appeared to be decreased in pregnant animals compared with non-pregnant animals (Fig. 4), further suggesting that P3 and P2 promoters may be subject to regulation by hormones. However, unlike the P1 promoter, whose activity increases dramatically after birth (22Lucy M.C. Boyd C.K. Koenigsfeld A.T. Okamura C.S. J. Dairy Sci. 1998; 81: 1889-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), developmental up-regulation of the activity of the P3 promoter in tissues such as liver and kidney was not suggested because similar levels of 1C3 and 1C2 5′-UTRs were detected in both adult and fetal tissues (Figs. 3 and 4).Examination of the proximal region upstream of 1C2 or 1C3 within the bovine GHR gene failed to identify a consensus TATA box. Absence of a consensus TATA box supports the presence of at least two different 1C-derived 5′-UTRs because TATA-less promoters usually initiate transcription from multiple start sites (41Lu J. Lee W. Jiang C. Keller E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5391-5402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Brakebusch C. Jallal B. Fusco O. Iacobelli S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3674-3682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The proximal region of the P3 promoter had a high content of GC (83% in the 700-bp proximal region) and lacked a CCAAT box. These features were thought to be unique to many constitutive gene promoters (43Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (370) Google Scholar) but now are also found in regulated genes (44Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Kanematsu T. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biol.

A search for potential transcription factor binding sites using the computer program MatInspector (47Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar) identified several sites for constitutively expressed transcription factor SP1 (48Jones N.C. Rigby P.W. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and also a number of sites for regulated factors such as STAT, AP1, AP2, and AP4 in the proximal region as well as in the more upstream region of the P3 promoter. Thus, the molecular mechanism for the hormonal regulation of the P3 and P2 promoters remains an important area of study.Mapping of the P3 promoter relative to exon 2 was not completed partly because of the large size of the exon 1 region in the GHR gene. Preliminary results generated from sequencing genomic clones indicate that there are at least 20 kb between exons 1C and 2. Although a definite map or DNA sequence for this region has not been established, our estimate is comparable to an estimate of 34 kb between 1B and exon 2 in the ovine GHR gene (13Adams T.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).In most species, one or two 5′-UTRs homologous to the bovine 1A or 1B or both have been isolated for the GHR mRNA (49Edens A. Talamantes F. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 559-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In human, eight GHR mRNA 5′-UTRs (namely V1 to V8) were reported (23Pekhletsky R.I. Chernov B.K. Rubtsov P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Among them, the DNA sequences of V1 and V2 are about 80% identical to the bovine 1A and 1B, respectively. Comparison of the bovine 1C with the human V3 to V8 only revealed a 30–50% similarity, suggesting that the human homolog of the bovine 1C was not included among the remaining six human 5′-UTRs. In the bovine GHR gene, exon 1C was located 700 bp from exon 1B (Fig. 5). The DNA sequence of the bovine GHR exon 1B and its proximal 5′- flanking region was more than 90% identical to the corresponding region in the human GHR gene (GenBank accession AJ002175) and also to the corresponding region in the ovine GHR gene (13Adams T.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the human and ovine homologs of the bovine exon 1C might exist in the human and ovine GHR mRNA. Five 5′-UTRs (V1 to V5; nomenclature for the rat and for the human 5′-UTRs are not equivalent) were also reported for the rat GHR mRNA (24Domene H.M. Cassorla F. Werner H. Roberts Jr., C.T. Leroith D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The rat 5′-UTR V2 and V1 are similar to the bovine 5′-UTR 1A (therefore ovine 1A, human V1) and the bovine 5′-UTR 1B (ovine 1B, human V2) in both DNA sequence (approximately 70% identity) and expression pattern (liver-specific and ubiquitous, respectively). Our alignment of cDNA sequences suggests that the rat V4 might be the homolog of bovine 1C because rat V4 and bovine 1C share a region with 75% identity (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, the rat V4 and the bovine 1C 5′-UTRs are expressed in similar locations, i.e. liver and many non-hepatic tissues (24Domene H.M. Cassorla F. Werner H. Roberts Jr., C.T. Leroith D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting the ubiquitous activity of the P3 promoter in the rat and perhaps in other species. However, compared with 30–40% of representation of 1C-derived GHR transcripts in the total GHR mRNA within non-hepatic tissues, V4 is the predominant form of GHR mRNA transcripts in rats (24Domene H.M. Cassorla F. Werner H. Roberts Jr., C.T. Leroith D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The relative activity of P3 and P2 promoters, therefore, may be different for different species. Although three GHR promoters (P1, P2, and P3) appear to exist in various species, isolation of other 5′-UTRs for the human GHR mRNA (23Pekhletsky R.I. Chernov B.K. Rubtsov P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the rat GHR mRNA (24Domene H.M. Cassorla F. Werner H. Roberts Jr., C.T. Leroith D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the bovine GHR mRNA2 suggests that the GHR promoters may not be limited to P1, P2, and P3. Other promoters remain to be identified and characterized for the GHR gene. The growth hormone (GH)1receptor (GHR) is a member of the cytokine/hematopoietin receptor superfamily that includes receptors for prolactin, hematopoietin, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferons, and many interleukins (1Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The highest levels of GHR expression are found in liver. Expression of GHR is also readily detectable in many other tissues such as muscle, fat, kidney, and heart (2Baumbach W.R. Horner D.L. Logan J.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 3Hauser S.D. McGrath M.F. Collier R.J. Krivi G.G. Mol. Cell.

In liver, GHR mediates the action of GH on the synthesis and systemic secretion of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which is essential for growth as well as numerous metabolic processes (6Kelly P.A.

In non-hepatic tissues, GHR may mediate the local effect of GH on both proliferation and differentiation at the cellular level, through IGF-I-dependent or -independent mechanisms (8Billestrup N.

To identify the mechanism that mediates KSR-1 translocation, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen.

Inactivating mutations in theksr-1 gene blocked the phenotypic effects of activated Ras in these animals, suggesting that KSR-1 is a positive regulator of Ras-mediated signaling. Genetic epistasis experiments inDrosophila demonstrated that KSR-1 acts downstream of Ras but upstream of or parallel to Raf (4Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M.

Overexpression of KSR-1 in Xenopus oocytes was found by two groups (including ours) to weakly promote MAP kinase activation (5Xing H. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), overexpression of KSR-1 in cultured mammalian cells was found to promote MAP kinase activation; it was shown to inhibit Ras-mediated signaling at the level of MEK activation in several studies (8Denouel-Galy A.

Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.-L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the absence of loss-of-function studies in mammalian cells, the definitive role of KSR-1 in Ras-mediated signaling remains unclear.Both invertebrate and mammalian forms of KSR-1 consist of a putative amino-terminal regulatory portion and a carboxyl-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain. Five functional domains of KSR-1 have been identified, including a unique amino-terminal CA1 domain, a proline-rich CA2 domain, a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like CA3 domain, a serine/threonine rich CA4 domain, and the amino-terminal protein kinase CA5 domain (4Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). KSR-1 is most homologous to Raf-1 kinase, but there is no evidence that KSR-1 can bind to Ras or phosphorylate MEK. Indeed, the in vivo substrate(s) of the kinase domain of KSR-1 is unknown (7Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Cacace A. Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).One model of KSR-1 action purports that it is a molecular scaffold that behaves like the budding yeast protein ste5, functionally linking the protein kinases ste11, ste7, and fus3/kss1 (6Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Indeed, KSR-1 has been shown to interact with 14–3-3 protein, Raf-1, MEK, and MAP kinase in coimmunoprecipitation experiments and yeast two-hybrid assays (5Xing H. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 6Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7743-7748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether KSR-1 links these associated proteins to promote signal transduction. Mutational analysis of KSR-1 has revealed that separable domains bind to distinct signaling proteins. For example, in vitro binding assays have demonstrated that the CA4 domain of KSR-1 interacts with MAP kinase (12Jacobs D. Glossip D.D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid assays have shown that the CA5 domain of KSR-1 binds to MEK (8Denouel-Galy A. Douville E.M. Warne P.H. Papion C. Laugier D. Calothy G. Downward J. Eychene A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 46-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Yu W. Fantl W.J. Harrowe G. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 56-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).The subcellular localization of KSR-1 is dependent on the activation state of cells. We previously demonstrated that KSR-1 is a cytoplasmic protein in serum-starved cells, but that KSR-1 translocates to the plasma membrane after stimulation with serum (5Xing H. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The time course of this translocation is similar to that observed for Raf-1 kinase, which binds to activated Ras at the plasma membrane. Work by Michaud et al. (7Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Cacace A. Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12792-12796Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) has established that the cysteine-rich CA3 domain of KSR-1 is essential for translocation to the plasma membrane. One explanation for this observation is that KSR-1 accompanies Raf-1 to the plasma membrane, but inactive Raf-1 does not bind to KSR-1 (5Xing H. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that KSR-1 directly binds to a constitutively membrane-bound target after serum stimulation. To further explore this possibility, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using KSR-1 as bait.RESULTSWe performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a cDNA that encoded the CA2 through CA5 domains of mKSR-1 (CA2–5) as bait with a HeLa cell two-hybrid library. Three positive clones were found to encode the γ10 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins (18Morishita R. Ueda H. Kato K. Asano T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); the subunit did not interact with the protein kinase Mos or with nuclear lamin on two-hybrid assay. In subsequent experiments with the two-hybrid assay to determine whether the interaction between CA2–5 and γ subunits was specific for γ10, we found that γ2 and γ3 also bound to CA2–5 (Fig.1). Several additional deletion mutant forms of mKSR-1 were then generated to identify the portion of mKSR-1 that was interacting with these subunits (Fig. 1 A). The cysteine-rich zinc finger-like CA3 domain of mKSR-1 interacted with γ2, γ3, and γ10 in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 B), whereas neither the proline-rich CA2 domain nor the protein kinase CA5 domain of mKSR-1 interacted with any of the subunits. A construct that contained the CA4 domain was found to be transcriptionally active on its own in yeast.In living cells, β and γ subunits are obligatorily bound to each other (19Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the ability of the isolated CA3 domain of mKSR-1 to bind to βγ subunits derived from cultured cell protein lysates. Recombinant GST fusion proteins that contained the CA1 and CA2 domains, the CA3 domain, the CA4 domain, or the CA5 domain of mKSR-1 were immobilized on glutathione beads and were incubated with NIH/3T3 cell protein lysates. Adherent proteins were analyzed by anti-β subunit immunoblotting, because the larger β subunit is more readily detectable on immunoblots than the γ subunit, and revealed that βγ subunits bound to immobilized GST-CA3, but not to GST-CA1CA2, GST-CA4, or GST-CA5 (Fig.2 A). We have previously demonstrated that GST-CA4 specifically interacts with MAP kinase (12Jacobs D. Glossip D.D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and that GST-CA5 binds to MEK. 2Heming Xing and Anthony J. Muslin, unpublished observations. Figure 2Association of mKSR-1 with βγ subunits in vitroand in vivo. A, in vitro association of the CA3 domain of mKSR-1 with βγ subunits. Bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione beads, and samples were incubated with NIH/3T3 cell protein lysates. The beads were washed and adherent proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting by use of an an anti-pan-β subunit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The fusion proteins contained protein fragments corresponding to GST alone (GST), the CA1 and CA2 domains (GST-CA1CA2), the CA3 domain (GST-CA3), the CA4 domain (GST-CA4), and the CA5 domain (GST-CA5) of mKSR-1. B, in vivo association of mKSR-1with β1γ3 subunits in transfected cells. COS7 cells were triple transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding wild-type mKSR-1, human β1, and human γ3. Anti-KSR or control (rabbit IgG) immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting by use of an anti-β1subunit antibody (BN-1). Protein lysates derived from 5 × 105 cells were used for each immunoprecipitation. This immunoblot is representative of the results of three separate experiments. C, in vivo association of mKSR-1 with βγ subunits in untransfected cells. Untransfected COS7 cells were cultured in the absence of serum for 24 h and then some were stimulated with 10% fetal bovine serum for 10 min. Anti-KSR or control (rabbit IgG) immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting by use of an anti-pan-β subunit antibody. Protein lysates derived from 107 cells were used for each immunoprecipitation. This immunoblot is representative of the results of four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The ability of KSR-1 to interact with βγ subunits in vivo was examined in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. COS7 cells were triple transfected with β1, γ3, and mKSR-1. Anti-KSR immunoprecipitates obtained from transfected cell protein lysates were analyzed by anti-β subunit immunoblotting, and this showed that β1γ3 and KSR-1 form a complex in vivo (Fig. 2 B). The efficiency of this interaction was determined in three separate experiments by densitometric analysis of anti-KSR and anti-β subunit immunoblots: 57% ± 15% (S.E.) of β1γ3 bound to KSR-1.The ability of KSR-1 to interact with βγ subunits in untransfected cells was also investigated. Untransfected COS7 cells were cultured in the absence of serum for 24 h and then some cells were stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum for 10 min. Anti-KSR immunoprecipitates obtained from untransfected cell protein lysates were analyzed by anti-pan-β subunit immunoblotting and this showed that βγ and KSR-1 form a complex in serum-stimulated but not in serum-starved cells (Fig. 2 C).The ability of βγ subunits to form a complex with KSR-1 in vivo suggested that the liberation of free βγ subunits on G-protein activation could cause KSR-1 to translocate to the plasma membrane. We have previously demonstrated that serum stimulation of cultured NIH/3T3 cells results in a redistribution of a significant proportion of KSR-1 from the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates to the plasma membrane fraction (5Xing H. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because LPA is an important component of serum that binds to Gi-coupled receptors, we examined whether LPA could also induce this translocation of KSR-1 (20Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Cultured COS7 cells were treated with LPA, and the subcellular localization of KSR-1 was examined by differential centrifugation followed by immunoblotting. LPA treatment of cells resulted in robust redistribution of KSR-1 to the membrane fraction of cell lysates that was blocked by pretreatment with PTX, which specifically inhibits Gi (Fig. 3). Because LPA stimulates Gi-coupled receptors that can activate Ras (20Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), we wished to evaluate whether KSR-1 translocation was dependent on Ras activation. Transfection of cells with dominant-negative (N17) Ras did not inhibit LPA-induced redistribution (Fig. 3 B) (21Izquierdo M. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Figure 3Translocation of mKSR-1 from the cytosolic fraction to the membrane fraction of cell lysates. A, mKSR-1 translocates to the membrane fraction in response to LPA stimulation. COS7 cells that were transfected with wild-type mKSR-1 were cultured in the absence of serum (Unstimulated) and then were stimulated with LPA or 10% FCS. Some cells were preincubated with PTX before LPA stimulation (LPA/PTX). Detergent-free cell lysates were precleared, and then separated by high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h). Supernatants (S100) were reserved, and pellets (P100) were resuspended in an equal volume of buffer with added 1% Triton X-100. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting by use of an anti-KSR-1 or an anti-pan-β subunit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). B, mKSR-1 translocation in response to LPA is blocked by PTX, but not by dominant-negative (N17) Ras. COS7 cells were transfected with wild-type mKSR-1 or with mKSR-1 and N17 Ras. Cells were cultured in the absence of serum, and some were stimulated with LPA or 10% FCS, whereas others were preincubated with PTX before LPA stimulation. Cell lysates were separated and analyzed as described in A. Three subcellular fractionation experiment were downloaded to a computer and analyzed by densitometry with NIH Image software. The data are presented as the mean percent of mKSR-1 in the membrane fraction (membrane fraction + cytosolic fraction = 100%) ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To evaluate the biological significance of the interaction between βγ subunits and KSR-1, we evaluated MAP kinase activity in transfected cells. Cotransfection of cultured cells with β and γ subunits has previously been shown to result in MAP kinase activation in the absence of serum stimulation (22Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that free βγ subunits interact with and activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseγ, and this interaction is thought to eventually lead to activation of Ras and MAP kinase (23Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In this study the additional transfection of cultured cells with full-length mKSR-1 markedly inhibited β1γ3-induced MAP kinase activation without affecting β1 subunit protein levels (Fig. 4).Figure 4A, KSR-1 inhibits βγ-induced MAP kinase activation. Anti-ERK1 immunoprecipitates obtained from COS7 cell lysates were analyzed by in vitro kinase assay with myelin basic protein (MBP) used as a substrate. COS7 cell lysates were obtained from control untransfected cells, untransfected cells that were stimulated with 10% FCS, cells that were double-transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding β1 and γ3, or cells that were triple transfected with mKSR-1, β1, and γ3. Three separate triple transfections with mKSR-1, β1, and γ3 are depicted. Parallel samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-β1 subunit polyclonal antibody (BN-1). B, graphical depiction of the results of the in vitro kinase experiment described in A. The autoradiograph was downloaded to a computer and analyzed by densitometry with NIH Image software. The graph is representative of the results of three separate in vitro kinase experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe subcellular localization of many signaling proteins is highly regulated and is often an important determinant of their activity. Localization is thought to influence activity by increasing the proximity of an enzyme to activating molecules or to substrates. For example, the protein kinase Raf-1 must translocate to the plasma membrane to be fully activated (17Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 18Morishita R. Ueda H. Kato K. Asano T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The protein kinase KSR-1 also translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, but the importance of this event in regulating the activity of KSR-1 has not been determined. In the experiments described here, we evaluated the mechanism of the translocation of KSR-1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. By use of the yeast two-hybrid assay we confirmed that KSR-1 can interact with the γ2, γ3, and γ10 subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins. These G-protein subunits are lipid modified and have been shown to be constitutively plasma membrane-bound (19Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that KSR-1 binds to βγ subunits in cultured mammalian cells, and that a ligand that liberates βγ subunits, LPA, can stimulate the translocation of KSR-1 to the plasma membrane. These findings confirm that βγ subunits can mediate the translocation of KSR-1 to the plasma membrane.One interesting aspect of the interaction between γ subunits and KSR-1 is that βγ effectors usually bind directly to the larger β subunit (25Ford C.E.

The amino termini of both subunits form a continuous surface that could theoretically interact with effectors although it remains to be determined whether this is the site of interaction with KSR-1.We demonstrated by two-hybrid assay that the CA3 domain of KSR-1 can bind to γ2, γ3, and γ10. This domain is highly homologous to the cysteine-rich domains of Raf-1, A-Raf, protein kinase Cμ, and citron kinase, and is less homologous to the cysteine-rich domains of diacylglycerol kinase, the racGAP N-chimaerin, and the PTPL1-associated rhoGAP (BLAST search, National Center for Biotechnology Information). Previous investigations have demonstrated that Raf-1 can interact with βγ subunits in vitro and in vivo (34Pumiglia K.M. LeVine H. Haske T. Habib T. Jove R. Decker S.J. J. Biol.

It will be important to determine whether other proteins that contain cysteine-rich domains are able to interact with βγ subunits because of the possibility that cysteine-rich domains, as a class, are βγ effectors.The ability of βγ subunits to bind specifically to the CA3 domain, MEK to bind to CA5 (8Denouel-Galy A.

Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) supports the hypothesis that mKSR-1 is a scaffolding protein. In budding yeast, ste5 links βγ subunits (ste4, ste18) to the MAP kinase cascade proteins ste11, ste7, and fus3/kss1 and promotes their activation (35Inouye C. Dhillon N. Thorner J.

In marked contrast to findings with ste5, we found that overexpression of mKSR-1 inhibits βγ-induced MAP kinase activation. This discrepancy suggests that mKSR-1 has a unique physiologic role in the regulation of MAP kinase signaling. Our findings complement recent work by other investigators demonstrating that overexpression of mKSR-1 in cultured mammalian cells inhibits serum- and ligand-induced MAP kinase activation (8Denouel-Galy A.

https://openalex.org/W1511917665,"Hypotonic volume expansion of skate erythrocytes rapidly stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3, the membrane protein thought to mediate the osmotically sensitive taurine efflux. Skate erythrocytes possess numerous tyrosine kinases including p59fyn, p56lyn, pp60src, and p72syk, demonstrated by immune complex assays measuring autocatalytic kinase activity. Inclusion of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 in this assay showed that only Syk and Lyn can directly phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of band 3. Upon cell volume expansion, Syk activity was increased as assessed by three different assays (immune complex assay measuring autophosphorylation, assay of the level of phosphotyrosine of the immunoprecipitated kinase, and assay of level of 32P in the kinase immunoprecipitated from cells prelabeled with32PO4 and then volume-expanded). The tyrosine kinase Lyn was also stimulated by volume expansion, most notably when analyzed by the latter two methods. Volume expansion stimulated a large increase in the ability of Syk to phosphorylate band 3 at times that coincide with the stimulation of taurine flux. The stilbene piceatannol inhibited Syk preferentially over Lyn and other tyrosine kinases and inhibited volume-stimulated taurine efflux in a concentration-dependent manner similar to that for the inhibition of Syk. Two major phosphorylation peaks were detected in tryptic digests of cdb3 separated by reverse phase HPLC. Edman degradation demonstrated a phosphotyrosine in a YXXL motif. In conclusion, p72syk appears to be a strong candidate as a pivotal signal-transducing step in the volume-activated taurine efflux in skate red cells.

Among the most commonly utilized solutes to accomplish the volume decrease is the β-amino acid taurine, which can accumulate from 10–100 mm concentration in many cells (1Goldstein L. Davis-Amaral E.M. Musch M.W. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1690-1694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In erythrocytes of a number of species, the volume-stimulated taurine efflux appears to occur by a transport pathway that involves band 3 (2Goldstein L. Brill S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R1014-R1020PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fievet B. Gabillat N. Borgese F. Motais R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5158-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Oocyte expression of band 3 cloned from trout, but not mouse, results not only in a Cl− exchange activity, but also in a swelling-activated pathway for a number of solutes including taurine (4Fievet B. Perset F. Gabillat N. Guizouran H. Borgese F. Ripoche P. Motais R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This latter finding strongly supports a role for band 3 as either the volume-activated transporter or a component of a volume-activated taurine transport pathway. Volume expansion causes skate band 3 to undergo structural changes and to modify its interaction with other red cells proteins. Band 3 exists in the membrane primarily as a dimer in human (5Jennings M.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 80: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and skate (6Musch M.W. Davis E.M. Goldstein L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) erythrocytes. However, in skate erythrocytes under volume-expanded conditions band 3 forms a tetramer (6Musch M.W. Davis E.M. Goldstein L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of this complex is thought to be related to the interaction of band 3 with cytoskeletal proteins in the cell as volume expansion stimulates a high affinity interaction of skate band 3 with ankyrin (7Musch M.W. Goldstein L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21221-21225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, how this event relates to the formation of the tetramer and how this may mediate taurine efflux are as yet unknown. One biochemical change that occurs in skate band 3 in volume expansion is increased phosphorylation (8Musch M.W. Leffingwell T.R. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R65-R74PubMed Google Scholar). This event occurs very rapidly, and band 3 phosphorylation, particularly that of tyrosine, has been documented in a large number of studies of human red cells (e.g. Refs. 9Tuy F.P.D. Henry J. Rosenfeld C. Kahn A. Nature. 1983; 305: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Yannoukakos D. Meyer H.E. Vasseur C. Driancourt C. Wajeman H. Burseaux E. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1994; 269: 955-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recently has been shown to occur upon shrinkage of human erythrocytes (12Minetti G. Seppi C. Ciana A. Balduni C. Low P.S. Brovelli A. Biochem. J. 1998; 355: 305-311Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A number of tyrosine kinases have been detected in human erythrocytes, and of these, the kinase with the greatest ability to phosphorylate band 3 is p72syk (11Harrison M.L. Isacsson C.C. Burg D.L. Geahlen R.L. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 955-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that p72syk as well as p56lyn are activated by volume expansion of skate red blood cells. There is not a global stimulation of tyrosine kinases, because certain other tyrosine kinases investigated (pp60src and p59fyn) are not activated by volume expansion and do not readily phosphorylate band 3. Pervanadate treatment, which activates taurine efflux, also stimulates p72syk activity as well as its ability to tyrosine phosphorylate band 3. Thus, activation of p72syk by osmotic stress makes it an excellent candidate as a pivotal step in volume-stimulated taurine efflux through its phosphorylation of skate band 3. In addition, the level of band 3 phosphorylation may also be regulated by a protein-tyrosine phosphatase type 1B, which is closely associated with band 3. Little skates (Raja erinacea) were caught off Frenchman's Bay, ME or Woods Hole, MA and kept in running seawater. Blood was removed from a tail vessel into a heparinized syringe. Cells were pelleted (400 g for 2 min at room temperature), and the plasma and buffy coat were removed. Erythrocytes were resuspended in 5 volumes of isotonic (940 mosmol/liter) elasmobranch incubation medium (940 EIM)1 (composition: 300 mmol/liter NaCl, 5.2 mmol/liter KCl, 2.7 mmol/liter MgSO4, 5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 370 mmol/liter urea, 15 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.4), washed twice, and resuspended at 50% hematocrit in 940 EIM. To volume-expand the cells, erythrocytes were diluted 1:10 into 460 EIM (NaCl was reduced to 100 mm and urea to 250 mm). At varying times, 1000 μl of incubation mixture (50 μl of cell equivalent) were removed, immediately pelleted for 10 s in a microcentrifuge, and the cell pellet was snap-frozen. When appropriate, cells were pretreated with pervanadate (prepared fresh for each experiment as described (13Musch M.W. Davis-Amaral E.M. Leibowitz K.L. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1677-R1686Google Scholar)) for 20 min and included during hypotonic exposure. The presence of various tyrosine kinases was determined using specific antibodies and immunoprecipitation. Anti-p72syk (polyclonal), anti-p59fyn (polyclonal), anti-p56/53lyn (polyclonal), anti-pp60src (monoclonal GD11), anti p56lck (polyclonal, carboxyl terminus) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and prebound to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were lysed in 9 volumes (450 μl) of Nonidet P-40 lysis (IP) buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 225 mmNaCl, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmbenzamidine with 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A). Lysates were solubilized for 10 min and cleared by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with the antibodies at 4 °C for 120 min, and beads with immune complexes (antibodies and attached kinases) were washed two times with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% v/v Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors as above and then once with assay buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, with protease inhibitors). The activity of the kinases attached to the beads was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in the assay buffer (50 μl) with 5 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate and 1 μm[γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of 2 μg of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE stop solution and heated to 65 °C to elute the kinases from the beads (as well as the antibodies used to immunoprecipitate them). Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinyl difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, Medford, MA), and alkali-treated before radiography. To determine whether 30 min was in the linear activity range for each kinase, assays were allowed to proceed for up to 120 min. For each kinase, the assays were linear for nearly 60 min, and therefore, the 30-min assay was selected (data not shown). Volume-activated taurine flux is bidirectional and may be measured in either efflux or uptake direction (2Goldstein L. Brill S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R1014-R1020PubMed Google Scholar). Because it is more practical to measure the flux at early times in the uptake direction, we used taurine uptakes to determine the time course of volume-activated taurine flux. Uptakes were measured as follows. Briefly, erythrocytes were washed and resuspended in 940 EIM. Taurine uptake was initiated by adding cells either into 940 or 460 lithium EIM (with sodium salts replaced by lithium salts so that sodium-dependent taurine uptake did not contribute to the uptake) containing 0.4 μCi/ml of [3H]taurine. At varying times, samples were removed and immediately spun to pellet cells. Cells were washed three times with the appropriate EIM to remove labeled taurine in the extracellular spaces. Perchloric acid (7% final concentration) was added to the cells, and after being kept on ice for 15 min, precipitated material was pelleted in a microcentrifuge, and an aliquot of the supernatant was counted for radioactivity. When appropriate, cells were treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor piceatannol (from a 10 mm stock in Me2SO) for 30 min before taurine efflux measurements (2Goldstein L. Brill S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R1014-R1020PubMed Google Scholar). Piceatannol was also included in the buffer used to remove extracellular radioactivity as well as in the flux buffer to ensure a constant level of the inhibitor from the beginning to the end of the flux measurement period. The activities of the tyrosine kinases were also measured in vivo by two different assays. First, as most of the tyrosine kinases require phosphorylation of tyrosine to become active, the kinases were immunoprecipitated after solubilization, run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed using the antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. Kinase activities were also assessed by analyzing cells previously incubated with (32PO4) for 8 h in phosphate-free 940 EIM with 5 mm added glucose. The cells were then washed and diluted to 10% hematocrit in 940 or 460 EIM, 1-ml samples were removed at varying times, and the cells were pelleted and snap-frozen. The samples were thawed on ice in IP buffer, and kinases were immunoprecipitated. The 32P-labeled kinases were eluted from the antibodies with Laemmli stop solution, run on SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed after the gels were dried. Cells were incubated with (32PO4) for 8 h as above and washed, and their volume was expanded for 5 min. Time courses were not performed because of the amount of material required for the two conditions isotonic and hypotonic. The entire band 3 or the cytoplasmic domain (obtained by mild trypsinization, 50 ng/ml ghosts) were immunoprecipitated as described previously (13Musch M.W. Davis-Amaral E.M. Leibowitz K.L. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1677-R1686Google Scholar), run on SDS-PAGE, and electroeluted from the gel as described by Hunkapillar et al. (14Hunkapillar M.W. Luja E. Ostander F. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The samples were dried, resuspended in water, and treated with 10 μg/ml trypsin at 30 °C for 30 min, and the peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC using a Waters C18 column (0.8 × 25 cm). The peptides were eluted at 0.5 ml/min using a solvent system of buffer A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water) with a 90-min linear gradient to solvent B (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid with 75% acetonitrile). Fractions (0.5 min) were counted for32P by Cerenkov counting, and fractions with the greatest difference between isotonic and hypotonic conditions were analyzed for peptide sequence. The samples were dried, dissolved in 25% aqueous acetonitrile, and applied to Sequelon AA disks and dried overnight. Ten μl of fresh 0.1 m MES, pH 5, 10% acetonitrile, and 10 mg of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/ml were applied and allowed to react for 30 min. Sequencing used an Applied Biosystems 470 gas phase sequencer connected on line to a phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Following Edman degradation, a portion of the resulting derivatized amino acids was collected and counted for32P. Band 3 was immunoprecipitated from cells under isotonic and hypotonic conditions by the method previously described (8Musch M.W. Leffingwell T.R. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R65-R74PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of co-immunoprecipitated PTP1B, Western blots of the immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with anti-PTP1B polyclonal antiserum. Blots were washed and then developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. Erythrocytes from numerous species have been demonstrated to have high levels of protein-tyrosine kinase activity, and recently a number of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have been identified in red cells (9Tuy F.P.D. Henry J. Rosenfeld C. Kahn A. Nature. 1983; 305: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Harrison M.L. Isacsson C.C. Burg D.L. Geahlen R.L. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 955-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We measured the activities of tyrosine kinases in extracts of skate erythrocytes. Four tyrosine kinases found in human erythrocytes (Fyn, Lyn, Src, and Syk) and one tyrosine kinase not found in erythrocytes (lck found primarily in T-lymphocytes) were measured, and their ability to phosphorylate band 3 was determined by immunocomplex kinase assay (Fig. 1). Although it is difficult to compare activities of one kinase to another because of potential differences in sensitivity to assay conditions, the most active tyrosine kinase under the conditions measured was p72syk. Smaller activities of pp60src, p56/53lyn, and p59fyn were found, and no activity of p56lck could be detected (not shown). When the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 was included in the reactions, all the kinases demonstrated some ability to tyrosine phosphorylate band 3 upon very long exposures of the autoradiographs, but most signal was detected from p72sykfollowed by p56/53lyn (at least 5–10 times less active at phosphorylating band 3 than p72syk). Because cell volume expansion is known to increase phosphorylation of band 3 in skate erythrocytes (8Musch M.W. Leffingwell T.R. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R65-R74PubMed Google Scholar), the activities of three of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases were measured under cell volume expansion conditions for 10 min. Only p72sykdemonstrated an increase in activity after volume expansion when assessed using autophosphorylation as the measure of activation (Fig.2). Utilizing this assay protocol, neither p56/53lyn nor pp60src increased in activity after hypotonic exposure. p72syk was rapidly activated (within 2 min) after hypotonic stress and can be most readily observed when the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 is included in the kinase reaction (Fig.3).Figure 3Time course of activation of p72sykin volume-expanded skate erythrocytes. Cells were incubated for the times indicated under isotonic (ISO) or hypotonic (HYPO) conditions and then frozen. Cells were thawed, and p72syk activity was measured by an immune complex assay using [32P]ATP in the absence (−cdb3) or presence (+cdb3) of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3. The autoradiographs shown are representative of those from three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the immune complex assay conditions may alter the activity of kinases, we determined whether certain kinases were activated in vivo by two additional methods. The first was to investigate the level of phosphotyrosine under stimulated conditions, and the second was to determine the level of 32P of the kinases from [32P]phosphate-labeled cells. The first has the disadvantage that it only analyzes phosphotyrosine and if serine or threonine is phosphorylated, this would not be shown. However, analysis for phosphotyrosine is also very sensitive. The second has the advantage that all three potential phosphorylated amino acids could be observed, but it is quite difficult to label erythrocytes well with32PO4, and the signals are often quite low. Using both of these latter techniques, we observed stimulation of Syk as well as Lyn under volume-expanded conditions (Fig.4), whereas pp60src did not demonstrate any activation. Because band 3 has been implicated as an osmolyte channel or channel regulator involved in volume-activated taurine transport (1Goldstein L. Davis-Amaral E.M. Musch M.W. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1690-1694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Fievet B. Gabillat N. Borgese F. Motais R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5158-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we compared the time courses of p56lyn and p72syk activation with that for volume-activated taurine transport. Fig.5 shows that the time courses for activation of the two processes were roughly similar. All were activated by 2 min, peaked at about 5 min, and fell after that. However, there is not an exact quantitative correlation in the three time courses, because Syk and Lyn activities peaked a little later and fell somewhat faster than the taurine flux. The time courses for Syk and Lyn activation are also quite similar to what we found previously for the volume-activated phosphorylation of band 3 in hypotonically stressed intact skate erythrocytes (8Musch M.W. Leffingwell T.R. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R65-R74PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Effect of volume expansion on taurine flux, p72syk and p56lyn activities. Taurine uptake was measured under isotonic and hypotonic conditions in lithium-containing incubation medium to prevent sodium-dependent uptake from obscuring the signal through the volume-sensitive pathway. Kinase activities presented are kinase activities from 32P-labeled cells. Data shown are means ±S.E. for four experiments. ■, Syk; ▴, Lyn; ●, taurine uptake.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine which kinase(s) is (are) required in the activation of taurine efflux, we used the stilbene piceatannol, which has been described as a selective inhibitor of Syk (15Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The selectivity of piceatannol was confirmed as shown in Fig.6. We used the immune complex assay to determine the selectivity because of the strong signal in this assay, allowing better quantitation of the effect of piceatannol on the kinases. It is an assumption that this selectivity carries over into the intact cell. When hypotonic-stimulated taurine efflux was measured after piceatannol treatment, the 50% inhibitory concentration agreed well with that of inhibition of Syk, supporting an important role for this kinase in activation of the taurine transporter. We previously found that pervanadate stimulated taurine efflux in both intact skate erythrocytes and in inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from these erythrocytes (13Musch M.W. Davis-Amaral E.M. Leibowitz K.L. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1677-R1686Google Scholar). Stimulation was observed in both control and volume-expanded cells. Because pervanadate is known to be an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (16Heffetz D. Buskin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zick Y. Sagi-Eiserberg R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of the inhibitor on the autophosphorylation of p72syk and the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (cdb3) by p72syk. As seen in Fig. 7, pervanadate enhanced the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation produced by p72syk both in the presence and absence of cdb3 at all time points examined under both isotonic and hypotonic conditions. The enhancement of the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation by pervanadate is quite similar to the stimulation of taurine efflux by this agent previously observed in intact erythrocytes and membrane vesicles from skate red blood cells (13Musch M.W. Davis-Amaral E.M. Leibowitz K.L. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1677-R1686Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, both the entire immunoprecipitated32PO4-labeled band 3 molecule and32PO4-labeled cdb3 (prepared by mild tryp- sinization of band 3) were analyzed. The major32PO4-labeled HPLC peaks (which increased during hypotonic stimulation) were always observed in both analyses. Because the separations with the cdb3 provided less background and better resolution of the HPLC peaks, these were selected for amino acid analysis, and a representative tracing is presented in Fig.8 showing32PO4-labeling as well as absorbance at 215 nm. The two largest peaks were analyzed by Edman degradation. For the peak that eluted later (peak B on Fig. 8), 16 amino acids were determined. The amino acid sequence determined was GDAQAYVELNELMGNS, which is the same as for cloned trout band 3 (18Hubner S. Michel F. Rudloff V. Appelhans H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and corresponds to residues 75–90 (18Hubner S. Michel F. Rudloff V. Appelhans H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 32P analysis of the eluate from the Edman analysis is presented in Fig. 9, which demonstrates that the Tyr (Y) at position 6 was found to contain 32P, which increased significantly during volume expansion. The serine at position 16 contained 32P, which did not change during volume expansion. For peak A, we were only able to obtain 5 amino acids from the amino terminus of this tryptic peptide with the sequence HEEDS: residues 44–48 of the trout band 3 (18Hubner S. Michel F. Rudloff V. Appelhans H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). If the tryptic fragment we have does correspond to the fragment in the trout, a tyrosine is anticipated in another 16 amino acids. The tyrosine we identified as well as the one we believe may be there in peak A are both in YXXL sequences. This sequence is often required for the activation of a number of tyrosine kinases as is part of an ITAM motif (18Hubner S. Michel F. Rudloff V. Appelhans H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Figure 932 P content of eluate of Edman analysis of peak B of Fig. 8. A portion of the post-column-derivatized material was collected, and the 32P content was counted. Data presented is counts/5 min and is the mean ±S.E. for 3 analyses. The difference observed at the tyrosine (Y) at position 6 is significantly different, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The enhancement of protein tyrosine phosphorylation by p72syk in the presence of pervanadate suggests that the level of phosphorylation of proteins phosphorylated by p72sykis regulated by protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Because erythrocytes are known to be a rich source of these phosphatases (20Clari G. Brunati A.M. Moret V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Zipser Y. Kosower N.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we assayed extracts of skate erythrocytes for protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Among the protein-tyrosine phosphatases, a type 1B has been reported to be closely associated with band 3 in human red blood cells (20Clari G. Brunati A.M. Moret V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar association occurs in skate red cells, skate band 3 was immunoprecipitated, and protein-tyrosine phosphatases were detected by probing Western blots of co-immunoprecipitated proteins. As shown in Fig. 10, a protein reacting with anti-1B tyrosine phosphatase and consistent with the molecular weight of a PTP1B is associated with band 3. The distribution of this protein does not vary with hypotonic exposure. When three separate experiments were analyzed by densitometry, no significant difference at any time point was observed. When we tried to probe the same samples for p72syk, we were unable to detect p72syk in the immunoprecipitates. Thus although p72sykmay rapidly phosphorylate band 3, it does not form a complex of sufficient affinity to withstand the immunoprecipitation conditions. Although band 3 is known to be a prime target for tyrosine phosphorylation by p72syk, we now demonstrate the tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3 under physiologically relevant conditions, namely volume expansion. In the present studies, we have presented data showing the activation of p72syk during hypotonic expansion of skate red blood cells. Other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which are present in the erythrocytes, including pp60src and Fyn, are not activated. The activation of the kinase p56lyn was not observed using the immune complex assay but was seen when assessed by analyzing activation in the intact cell. It may be that the artificial conditions used in the immune complex assay may alter the activity of the kinase and/or remove regulatory proteins. The results from the intact cell demonstrate Lyn activation and could be considered the more appropriate measure of activity. The pivotal role of Syk was demonstrated using the selective inhibitor piceatannol, which preferentially inhibits Syk more than Lyn and inhibits pp60src only poorly. One cannot state that Lyn activation is not involved in the stimulation of taurine efflux, but Syk activation is a required step in this process. Activation of Lyn and Syk may both be required to stimulate taurine efflux maximally. Inclusion of the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate, which has the physiologic effect in skate erythrocytes of potentiating a volume-induced taurine efflux during the regulatory volume decrease (13Musch M.W. Davis-Amaral E.M. Leibowitz K.L. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1677-R1686Google Scholar), also increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3 by p72syk. Because many of the tyrosine kinases are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, inhibition of the phosphatases that inactivate these kinases may leave them in an active state. The effect of pervanadate was only pursued for Syk, as the latter appears to be required for the stimulation of taurine efflux. Lyn activity may be stimulated in pervanadate-treated cells, but we did not test this possibility. The tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3 occurs, at least in part and likely predominantly, on the cdb3. We have identified one tyrosine in a YXXL sequence in skate band 3 that is phosphorylated under volume-expanded conditions, and a sequence from another tryptic peptide indicates that this may also have a phosphotyrosine in a YXXL sequence. This belief is based on the amino acid sequence of trout band 3, which has been cloned. The two peptides we have analyzed are consistent with tryptic predictions from this sequence. It is interesting that in the trout sequence, these two YXXL motifs, are separated by 13 amino acids. Certain tyrosine kinases require phosphorylation of one or both Y in two YXXL sequences 4–7 amino acids apart. (19Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 209-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). This is termed an ITAM-motif, and it is possible that these two YXXL are essential in the activation of volume-expanded activation of band 3. The phosphorylation may act to bring kinases or other associated proteins to band 3, and this may regulate band 3 interaction with additional regulatory proteins including ankyrin or band 4.1. Precise kinetic comparisons between the kinase activations and taurine flux should not be made. There are technical limitations on how rapidly taurine flux may be measured so that a very rapid phase, within 2 min, cannot be measured. Thus one cannot state that there are activation steps between kinase activation and taurine flux simply based on the data presented. Also, quantitative comparisons should not be made because one of the major purposes of kinases is amplification of a signal. Therefore, a small activation of Syk may lead to a large activation of taurine flux. One may be able to stimulate a greater percentage of the cell Syk without further additional effect on taurine flux; however, this is only speculative. p72syk may play an important role in the volume-activated taurine efflux of the skate erythrocyte. Skate band 3, which is a substrate of p72syk, is thought to act as a channel or channel activator for the volume-activated taurine efflux in fish erythrocytes (1Goldstein L. Davis-Amaral E.M. Musch M.W. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1690-1694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Fievet B. Gabillat N. Borgese F. Motais R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5158-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A very recent study using oocyte expression of trout band 3 has further reinforced its role in volume-activated solute fluxes (4Fievet B. Perset F. Gabillat N. Guizouran H. Borgese F. Ripoche P. Motais R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Not only may band 3 mediate Cl− exchange when expressed in oocytes, but when trout (but not mouse) band 3 is expressed, a channel is introduced that transports taurine, sorbitol, and urea. This transport pathway has very similar pharmacologic inhibitory properties to those we have previously described in skate red blood cells. This data strongly supports a role of band 3 in the transport of organic osmolytes under volume-expanded conditions. Band 3 has been shown to be rapidly phosphorylated during volume expansion of the skate erythrocyte. In the present study we have shown that the time courses for activation of the taurine flux measured in skate red blood cells and activation of p72syk activity measured in red blood cell extracts using the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 as a substrate are quite similar. Furthermore, pervanadate, which increases the level of phosphorylation of cdb3 brought about by volume-activated p72syk activity, also enhances the volume-activated efflux of taurine in both intact skate erythrocytes and membrane vesicles (13Musch M.W. Davis-Amaral E.M. Leibowitz K.L. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1677-R1686Google Scholar). This evidence raises the possibility that activation of p72sykmay be a crucial step in the volume recovery process. Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are recognized as a major signal transduction mechanism used in a vast array of cells. Specifically with regard to Syk, this kinase has been implicated in such events as B cell antigen receptor signaling (22Richards J.D. Gold M.R. Hourihane S.L. DeFranco A.L. Matsuuchi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6458-6466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), neutrophil signaling through adhesion complexes (23Yan S.R. Huang M. Berton G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1902-1910PubMed Google Scholar), apoptosis stimulated by osmotic stress or ultraviolet radiation in B cells (24Qin S. Minami Y. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17994-17999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), integrin cross-linking in myeloid cells (25Gotoh A. Takahira H. Geahlen R.L. Broxmeyer H.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 721-729PubMed Google Scholar), and thrombin stimulation of platelet aggregation (26Wang X. Yanagi S. Yang C. Inatome R. Yamamura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the case of the fish erythrocytes, an important step will be to define the signal between cell swelling and Syk activation. In addition to the SH2 or SH3 domains, other domains of Syk are critical as Latour et al. (27Latour S. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22782-22790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) elucidate while making chimeras of Syk and ZAP-70. The SH2 as well as portions of the carboxyl-terminal domains both play a role in the regulation of kinase activity. Kinases may not only be important for their ability to phosphorylate, but they have been speculated to serve structural roles in addition. In the B-lymphocyte cell line DT-40, p72syk plays a central role in cell activation (28Wan Y. Bence K. Hata A. Kurosaki T. Veillette A. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17209-17215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), potentially through its interactions with Grb2/SOS (which may then activate the mitogen-activate protein kinase cascade). Therefore, p72syk, potentially through its SH2 domain and other domains, may bring together the requisite proteins for a functional response to occur and be part of a complex of cytosolic and membrane proteins involved in activating the efflux of taurine."

The cDNA contains an open reading frame coding for a protein of 335 amino acids with a predicted type II transmembrane protein orientation. Cotransfection of the cDNA with HNK-1 3-O-sulfotransferase produced HNK-1 carbohydrate epitopes in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and COS-7 cells. In vitro, a soluble recombinant form of the enzyme transferred GlcUA in β-linkage to Galβ1,3/4GlcNAcβ-O-naphthalenemethanol, which resembles the core oligosaccharide on which the HNK-1 epitope is assembled. However, the enzyme greatly preferred Galβ1,3Galβ-O-naphthalenemethanol, a disaccharide component found in the linkage region tetrasaccharide in chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate. During the course of this study, a human cDNA clone was described that was thought to encode UDP-GlcUA:Galβ1,3Gal-R glucuronosyltransferase (GlcUAT-I), involved in the formation of the linkage region of glycosaminoglycans (Kitagawa, H., Tone, Y., Tamura, J., Neumann, K.

The deduced amino acid sequences of the CHO and human cDNAs are 95% identical, suggesting that they are in fact homologues of the same gene. Transfection of a CHO cell mutant defective in GlcUAT-I with the hamster cDNA restored glycosaminoglycan assembly in vivo, confirming its identity. Interestingly, transfection of the mutant with GlcUAT-P also restored glycosaminoglycan synthesis. Thus, both GlcUAT-P and GlcUAT-I have overlapping substrate specificities. However, the expression of the two genes was entirely different, with GlcUAT-I expressed in all tissues tested and GlcUAT-P expressed only in brain.

HNK-1 (human natural killer cell carbohydrate antigen-1) was originally described on human natural killer cells (1Abo T. Balch C.M. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1024-1029PubMed Google Scholar), but later studies showed that it was present in greatest abundance in the nervous system on subsets of glycolipids (2Chou D.K. Ilyas A.A.

Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In contrast, glycosaminoglycans are ubiquitously distributed among tissues, usually in covalent linkage to proteoglycan core proteins (6Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Both HNK-1 and glycosaminoglycans can bind a variety of proteins that participate in cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix, and cell signaling during development (4Schachner M. Martini R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 183-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 6Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). The presence of GlcUA in both types of glycans and the partial overlap in their ligand binding properties suggest the possibility that their synthesis may be coordinated as well. Much information is available about the enzymes involved in the addition of GlcUA to these glycans. Assembly of HNK-1 occurs by the transfer of GlcUA from the high energy donor UDP-GlcUA to a terminal galactose residue linked β1,4 to GlcNAc, followed by sulfation of the GlcUA residue at C-3. The glucuronosyltransferase associated with HNK-1 was first demonstrated in embryonic chick brain extracts using neolactotetraosylceramide as acceptor (7Das K.K. Basu M. Basu S. Chou D.K. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5238-5243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same activity was found later in rat brain using both neolactotetraosylceramide and asialoorosomucoid as substrates (7Das K.K. Basu M. Basu S. Chou D.K. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5238-5243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kawashima C. Terayama K. Ii M. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Glycoconj.

By partially purifying the enzymes and noting differences in phospholipid activation and pH dependence, Oka et al. (9Oka S. Terayama K. Kawashima C. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22711-22714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that the glucuronosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of HNK-1 epitopes on glycoproteins (GlcUAT-P)1differs from the one that acts on glycolipids (GlcUAT-L). This hypothesis was confirmed recently in studies of recombinant GlcUAT-P, which selectively adds GlcUA to glycoprotein substrates (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The gene and cDNA encoding GlcUAT-L have not yet been identified. Glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis begins by the formation of the tetrasaccharide linkage intermediate -GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-Ser. This intermediate serves as the primer for heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate assembly, which arises from the alternating addition of β-GlcNAc and β-GlcUA or β-GalNAc and β-GlcUA residues, respectively, to the linkage tetrasaccharide. Three GlcUA-transferases are thought to catalyze the addition of GlcUA: one involved in the formation of the linkage region tetrasaccharide (GlcUAT-I) (11Brandt A.E. Distler J. Jourdian G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Helting T. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2799-2805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and two that polymerize the different chains (13Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Press, New York1980: 267-271Crossref Google Scholar). The latter activities may be part of bifunctional enzymes in which the same protein catalyzes the alternating addition of a HexNAc residue and GlcUA (14Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 15Lind T. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GlcUAT-I, in contrast, is much like GlcUAT-P in that it transfers GlcUA from UDP-GlcUA to a β-linked Gal residue. The enzyme was first described in embryonic chick cartilage (12Helting T. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2799-2805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and partially purified from embryonic chick brain (11Brandt A.E. Distler J. Jourdian G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and a mouse mastocytoma (16Helting T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4327-4332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these early studies showed that crude enzyme preparations transferred GlcUA not only to substrates derived from the linkage region, such as Galβ1,3Gal and Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xyl, but also to lactose (Galβ1,4Glc) and N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1,4GlcNAc), the precursor of HNK-1. These findings raised the question of whether formation of the linkage region and HNK-1 determinants is catalyzed by the same enzyme. Curenton et al. (17Curenton T. Ekborg G. Rodén L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) provided evidence that GlcUAT-I is distinct from the enzyme involved in HNK-1 formation based on partial separation of the activities and substrate competition studies. The cloning of a cDNA for GlcUAT-P confirmed that at east two enzymes exist, but detailed analysis of substrate specificity was not done. In the present report, we isolated a cDNA encoding a hamster glucuronosyltransferase that is 65% identical to GlcUAT-P (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K.

Analysis of the recombinant enzymes showed significant overlap in substrate specificity, and transfection experiments revealed that both enzymes will produce HNK-1 carbohydrate epitopes and facilitate glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis.

The PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and the sequence was determined on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method usingTaq polymerase (dye terminator cycle sequencing, Perkin-Elmer) with a DNA automatic sequencer (ABI PRISM genetic analyzer). Approximately 6 × 105 colonies from a CHO-K1 cDNA library in pcDNA1 were transferred to Duralon-UVTM membranes (Stratagene) and fixed by alkaline lysis as recommended by the manufacturer. The filters were prehybridized in a solution containing 0.02 m PIPES, 0.8 m NaCl, 50% (v/v) deionized formamide, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 2 h at 42 °C. The PCR product described above was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming (Prime-IT II labeling kit, Stratagene) and purified with an Elute-tip (Schleicher & Schüll). Hybridization was carried out for ∼16 h at 42 °C in the same buffer containing ∼1 × 106 cpm/ml32P-labeled probe, and positive clones were detected by conventional autoradiography. One of the plasmids obtained in this way (1B-2) contained the full-length sequence and was named pcDNA1-GlcUAT-X in initial experiments. This was later shown to encode a section of GlcUAT-I and therefore was renamed GenBank™/EBI accession number AF113703. Mouse multiple-tissue poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) was hybridized using gel-purified full-length cDNA for GlcUAT-I as a probe essentially according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Briefly, the solution was prewarmed to 68 °C, and the blot was prehybridized for 30 min. The Expresshyb solution was replaced with fresh solution containing 1–2 × 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled probe and hybridized at 68 °C for 1 h. The blot was rinsed and washed for 30–40 min at room temperature in 2× SSC containing 0.05% SDS with several changes of buffer and then for 40 min at 50 °C in 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, with one change of solution. Hybridization was detected with a PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 30–335 of GlcUAT-I (the putative stem region and catalytic domain) was prepared by PCR using pcDNA1-GlcUAT-I as a template. The fragment was fused in frame to the C terminus of protein A in pRK5-F10-PROTA (21Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3885-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The 5′-primer for PCR was GGCGAATTCACCATGTGACTGCCTCCTCC, and the 3′-primer was GGCGAATTCCAGTCCCACAAGGTATGTGCC (theEcoRI site is shown in boldface letters, and the coding sequence of GlcUAT-I is underlined). PCR was carried out withPfu polymerase (CLONTECH; 25 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final incubation at 72 °C for 7 min). The PCR products were cloned into pCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene), and the sequences were determined. The clone with the correct sequence was digested byEcoRI and ligated into the EcoRI site of pRK5-F10-PROTA to yield pPROTA-GlcUAT-I. The cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 39–347 of rat GlcUAT-P (GenBankTM/EBI accession number D88035) (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was prepared by PCR using pcDNA3-GlcUAT-P as a template (kindly provided by M. Fukuda). The 5′-primer was TCCGGAATTCCCAGAGCAGCCTCGCACCT, and the 3′-primer was GCCCTCGAG TGTGTAGTTTCAGATCTCCAC(the EcoRI and XhoI sites are shown in boldface letters). Expression of soluble recombinant enzyme was measured after transfection of COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The supernatant was centrifuged for 5 min at top speed in an IEC clinical centrifuge at 4 °C to sediment cell debris. The supernatant was collected and incubated with rabbit IgG-agarose beads (10 μl of beads/ml of sample; Sigma) with end-over-end mixing at 4 °C for 24–48 h. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatant was aspirated. The beads were washed twice with 10 ml of 20% (v/v) glycerol and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in the same buffer containing protease inhibitors (10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) to achieve an ∼50% (v/v) slurry. The immobilized enzyme was stable at 4 °C for at least 4 months. The cDNA insert of pcDNA1-GlcUAT-I was digested by HindIII and XhoI and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), yielding pcDNA3-GlcUAT-I. Lec2, wild-type CHO-K1, and pgsG mutant cells were transfected with pcDNA3-GlcUAT-I or pcDNA3-GlcUAT-P using LipofectAMINE, and stable transfectants were selected using 0.4 mg/ml (active) G418. Individual colonies were screened for HNK-1 expression or glycosaminoglycan production, and positive ones were isolated with glass cloning rings and expanded. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3-GlcUAT-I and/or pcDNA3-HNK-1 3OST (where 3OST is 3-O-sulfotransferase; M. Fukuda). Two days later, the monolayers were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed at 4 °C for 15 min with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed twice with PBS, blocked at room temperature for 10 min with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, and incubated at room temperature for 30–40 min with mouse monoclonal anti-HNK-1 antibody (Becton Dickinson Advanced Cellular Biology) diluted 1:100 in buffer. Primary antibody was removed, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 20–30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:100 with buffer. Cells were washed again with PBS, mounted with antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and examined by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-HNK-1 3OST. Two days later, they were scraped from the dishes, and 100 μg of cell protein was separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), the blot was blocked at 4 °C overnight with 4% (w/v) skim milk in PBS and then incubated at room temperature for 4 h with anti-HNK-1 antibody diluted 1:500 and for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:500. Bound antibody was visualized with diaminobenzidine reagent (Aldrich). Some samples were digested with peptideN-glycosidase F (22Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). UDP-[3H]GlcUA was synthesized as described previously with slight modification (23Bäckström G. Höök M. Lindahl U. Feingold D.S. Malmström A. Rodén L. Jacobsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim.d-[1-3H]Glucose (10 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) was dried (3.5 mCi, ∼180 nmol) and dissolved in a solution (500 μl) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 4 mm UTP, 2 mmNAD+, 10 mmd-glucose 1,6 diphosphate, 2 units/ml hexokinase, 4 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 1 unit/ml UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, 0.3 units/ml UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.35. After overnight incubation at 25 °C, the samples were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. The products in the supernatant were separated for 10 h by descending paper chromatography using ethanol and 1 m sodium acetate in water (7:3, v/v) as the solvent. Material that comigrated with the authentic UDP-GlcUA was eluted from the paper with 10% (v/v) ethanol/water, lyophilized, and dissolved in 100 μl of buffer containing 10 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 45 min at 37 °C, the sample was heated to 75 °C for 10 min, diluted with 1 ml of 0.1 nNH4HCO3, and loaded onto a 0.5-ml column of AG 1-X2 acetate resin (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 3 ml of water and 5 ml of 0.25 n NH4HCO3, and UDP-GlcUA was eluted with 3 ml of 1 mNH4HCO3. Enough Dowex 50-X8 (H+form, Bio-Rad) was added to neutralize the sample. After centrifugation, the supernatant was dried by lyophilization, dissolved in deionized water, and dried again. The final product was dissolved in 70% ethanol/water and stored at −20 °C for future use. Galβ1,4Glcβ-O-naphthalenemethanol (NM), Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ-O-NM, Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ-O-NM, Galβ1,3GalNAcα-O-NM, Galβ1,3Galβ-O-NM, and Galβ1,3Galβ-O-benzyl were chemically synthesized from individual monosaccharide units using standard orthogonal blocking chemistry, coupling, and deblocking strategies. The details of their synthesis, purification, and chemical characterization will be published elsewhere. 4A. K. Sarkar and J. D. Esko, manuscript in preparation. All compounds were >98% pure by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and thin-layer chromatography. Galβ1,3GalNAcα-O-benzyl, monosaccharide glycosides, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, asialofetuin (type II), and asialomucin were purchased from Sigma.N-Acetylheparosan oligosaccharides were prepared previously from Escherichia coli K5 capsular polysaccharide (24Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neolactotetraosylceramide was kindly provided by F. Jungalwala (Harvard Medical School), and neolactohexaose was provided by M. Fukuda. Unless otherwise indicated, the standard reaction (25 μl) contained 10 μl of IgG bead slurry (50%) containing immobilized enzyme, 0.1 μCi of UDP-[3H]GlcUA, 100 μm UDP-GlcUA, 0.03–10 mm acceptor, 100 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 10 mm MnCl2, and 2.5 mm ATP. For substrates containing Galβ1,3Galβ-O-NM, only 2 μl of the beads was used, and the reaction time was reduced to 1 h in order to work in the linear range (GlcUAT-I only). Assays for GlcUAT-P also contained only 2 μl of enzyme immobilized on beads. In repetitions of the experiments when different batches of the enzyme were used, an aliquot was first analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining to obtain comparable amounts of enzyme. After incubation at 37 °C, the reaction products were diluted with 1 ml of 0.5m NaCl and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (100 mg; Waters). After washing the cartridge with 2 ml of water, the product was eluted with 50% methanol, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation. Glycoprotein acceptors were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and the pellets were washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Transferase activity usingN-acetylheparosan acceptors was assayed using anion-exchange chromatography as described previously (24Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GlcUAT-I and GlcUAT-P activities were assayed under optimized condition using Galβ1,3Galβ-O-NM as a substrate.2HNK-1 3-O-sulfotransferase activity was measured essentially according the method of Ong et al. (25Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but using 2 mm GlcUAβ1,3Galβ-O-NM as an acceptor. Radioactive product was dried and dissolved in 60 μl of solution containing 1.33 μg/μl sodium taurodeoxycholate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 2.5 units/μl β-glucuronidase from limpets or Helix pomatia(Sigma), and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The sample was diluted with 1 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and separated on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge as described above. The flow-through fraction, wash, and eluant were collected, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cells were labeled for 24 h with 10 μCi/ml H235SO4 (1600 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in sulfate-free medium. 35S-Labeled glycosaminoglycan chains were isolated by anion-exchange chromatography as described previously (26Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC using a 7.5 mm (inner diameter) × 7.5-cm column of DEAE-3SW (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA). The column was equilibrated in 10 mmKH2PO4 buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.2% (w/v) Zwittergent 3–12 and 0.2 m NaCl. The glycosaminoglycans were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.2–1 m) in the same buffer using a flow rate of 1 ml/min and by increasing the NaCl concentration by 10 mm/min. The effluent from the column was monitored for radioactivity with an in-line radioactivity detector (Radiomatic Flo One/beta, Packard Instrument Co.) with sampling rates every 6 s. The data were averaged over 1-min intervals. During a series of experiments to identify genes involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis (see “Experimental Procedures”), we found a cDNA clone that showed high homology to the recently cloned rat glycoprotein glucuronosyltransferase involved in the assembly of HNK-1 epitopes (GlcUAT-P) (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This clone, originally designated GlcUAT-X, contained sequence homologous to the C-terminal ectodomain of GlcUAT-P, but lacked an ATG start codon. Using the insert as a probe, we screened a commercial CHO-K1 cDNA library and isolated six different clones. Two of the longest cDNAs were potentially full-length based on the presence of putative start and stop codons. DNA sequencing revealed a single open reading frame with a potential Kozak consensus sequence for ribosome recognition just upstream from the ATG start codon and a polyadenylation signal located close to a poly(A) run (Fig. 1). The open reading frame encoded a 335-amino acid protein. Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (38Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) indicated one potential transmembrane domain consisting of 18 hydrophobic amino acid residues located 7 amino acids from the initiating Met residue. A relatively proline-rich segment followed the hydrophobic section, and one potentialN-glycosylation site in the putative ectodomain was present at Asn-299 (NCT, marked by an asterisk). These characteristics are common to type II transmembrane proteins and to many known Golgi glycosyltransferases (27Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, the sequence exhibited 65% identity to rat GlcUAT-P, and therefore, we tentatively characterized the cDNA as a homologue of this enzyme. GlcUAT-X was expressed in various adult mouse tissues as measured by Northern blot analysis using the full-length cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 2, a single transcript of ∼1.8 kilobase pairs was obvious in adult liver, brain, and heart; was moderately expressed in lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis; and was barely present in spleen. This distribution differs significantly from the expression of GlcUAT-P, which has two transcripts, one at 4.0 kilobase pairs and a minor one at 9.0 kilobase pairs, expressed strongly in brain (10Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most non-neural tissues do not normally express HNK-1 epitopes, suggesting that GlcUAT-X might not participate in HNK-1 f"

Among the several TGF-β isoforms TGF-β3 has a particularly low solubility at physiological pH and easily forms aggregates. A spectroscopic structural analysis of TGF-β3 in solution has thus been difficult. In this study, circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to determine the secondary structural elements of TGF-β3. In addition, the aggregation of TGF-β3 was investigated systematically as a function of pH and salt concentration using a rapid screening method. Sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity analysis revealed that TGF-β3 exists predominantly in two major forms: (i) monomers in solution at low pH and (ii) large precipitating aggregates at physiological pH. Under acidic conditions (pH < 3.8) the protein was not aggregated. At pH ∼3.9, a monomer ⇄ dimer equilibrium could be detected that transformed into larger aggregates at pH > 4.1. Aggregation was pronounced in the pH range of 4.3 < pH < 9.8 with the aggregation maximum between pH 6.5 and 8.5. The aggregation process was accompanied by a structural change of the protein. The CD spectra were characterized by an isodichroic point at 209.5 nm indicating a two-state equilibrium between TGF-β3 dissolved in solution and aggregated TGF-β3. Aggregated TGF-β3 showed a higher β-sheet content and lower β-turn and random coil contributions compared with monomeric TGF-β3. Both the solution structure and the aggregate structure of TGF-β3 were different from the crystal structure. This was in contrast to TGF-β2, which showed very similar crystal and solution structures. Under alkaline conditions (pH > 9.8) the turbidity disappeared and a further conformational change was induced. The pH dependence of the TGF-β3 conformation in solution in the range of 2.3 < pH < 11.0 was reversible. Aggregation of TGF-β3 was, furthermore, influenced by the presence of salt. For pH > 3.8 the addition of salt greatly enhanced the tendency to aggregate, even in the very basic domain. Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, c NaCl = 164 mm) TGF-β3 has almost the highest tendency to aggregate and will remain in solution only at nanomolar concentrations.

They are called growth factors for historical reasons (1Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) but their main function is to control cell proliferation and differentiation (2Kingsley D.M.

Five isoforms of TGF-β are known; however, only three of them are expressed in mammalians. All isoforms show a highly homologous sequence (>70% of conserved residues). For a given isoform the homology between proteins from different species is >95%. The isoforms have similar biological activities but exhibit differences in potency depending on the target cell examined (7Cox D.A. Cell Biol.

TGF-β is produced by virtually all cell types as inactive precursors (1Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. de Crombrugghe B. J.

The inactive precursor is first cleaved into a latent complex, which upon activation by acidification represents the regulation step of the signaling process of TGF-β (7Cox D.A. Cell Biol. Int. 1995; 19: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Koppa S.D. Drug Ther. 1994; 2: 34-37Google Scholar). The activation of latent TGF-βin vivo by osteoclasts during bone resorption may be linked to the acidification (pH < 3) of the osteoclast pericellular space (11Gleizes P.E. Munger J.S. Nunes I.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The in vivo activation seems, however, to be more often caused by proteolytic cleavage involving plasmin (13Grainger D.J. Kemp P.R. Liu A.C. Lawn R.M. Metcalfe J.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 460-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) or calpain (14Abe M. Oda N. Sato Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A further mechanism is the enzymatic deglycosylation of the mannose 6-phosphate of the latency associated peptide (15Miyazono K. Heldin C.H.

In addition, protease-independent conformational changes of the latent complex following binding to thrombospondin (16Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1164-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and was found to be very similar to the crystal structure of TGF-β2. The detailed comparison revealed only small differences (mainly in the β-turns) which, however, could play an important role in receptor binding and isoform recognition (24Hinck A.P. Archer S.J. Qian S.W. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L. Lucas R. Zhang B.L. Wenker J. Torchia D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8517-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TGF-β3 was also solved recently (25Mittl P.R. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grutter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Compared with the TGF-β2 crystal no essential differences in the tertiary structure were observed. Minor deviations were detected in the N-terminal α-helix and in the β-sheet loop regions. The well established differences in the biological activity of TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 (25Mittl P.R. Priestle J.P.

Alternatively, it could be argued that despite the rather similar crystal structures, the two peptides assume different structures in solution. This problem was investigated here with CD spectroscopy.The biologically active TGF-βs are homodimers consisting of two identical chains connected via a single interchain disulfide bridge (C77–C77), the latter being exposed to solvent. Heterodimeric TGF-β1,2 and TGF-β2,3 are also known but rather unusual (26Ogawa Y. Schmidt D.K. Dasch J.R. Chang R.J. Glaser C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2325-2328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of the active dimer results in the formation of inactive monomers. Activity is not recovered by simple reoxidation of the protein (27Archer S.J. Bax A. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Ogawa Y. Piez K.A. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L. Lucas R. Zheng B.L. Wenker J. Torchia D.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The 8 other cysteine residues form 4 intrachain disulfide bridges, leading to a structural feature called “TGF-β knot.” The knot is almost inaccessible to solvent and stabilizes the monomer structure. The monomer exhibits an elongated nonglobular structure with dimensions of about 60 × 20 × 15 Å3. As there is only a single interchain disulfide bridge between two monomers, hydrophobic interactions between the interface areas are supposed to be of major importance in stabilizing the dimer (18Daopin S. Piez K.A. Ogawa Y. Davies D.R. Science. 1992; 257: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 19Daopin S. Li M. Davies D.R.

Biol. 1993; 231: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, the dimer is further stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds, including several water molecules, located at well defined positions in the hydrophilic cavities surrounding the intersubunit disulfide bridge.In contrast to TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, TGF-β3 shows a strong tendency to aggregate at physiological pH, making spectroscopic measurements at pH 7.0 rather difficult. Inspection of the crystal structure of TGF-β3 reveals many hydrophobic residues on its surface, which could explain its low solubility. In view of the functional differences between TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 and also of the therapeutic potential of TGF-β3, a detailed characterization of TGF-β3 solubility and aggregation is required.In this study we have characterized the solution structure of TGF-β3 under a variety of conditions with CD spectroscopy. The experimental CD spectra were deconvoluted into its secondary structural elements and compared with the predictions derived from the TGF-β3 and TGF-β2 crystal structures. In addition, the details of the aggregation process and the structural changes accompanying aggregation were investigated. To this purpose, CD spectra were recorded as a function of pH, protein concentration, and salt concentration. Analytical ultracentrifugation measurements were performed to study the size of the aggregates while titrating TGF-β3 from acidic to basic conditions and vice versa. UV spectroscopy was used to monitor the turbidity of the TGF-β3 solutions as a result of protein aggregation at different pH and salt conditions.DISCUSSIONCD and UV spectroscopy as well as ultracentrifugation studies demonstrate that TGF-β3 is soluble in monomeric form at pH ≤ 3.8 and pH ≥ 9.7. In contrast, the peptide aggregates at intermediate pH values with the aggregation maximum occurring at 6.8 ≤ pH ≤ 8.2 (cf. Fig. 2). Based on the amino acid sequence (24Hinck A.P. Archer S.J. Qian S.W. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L. Lucas R. Zhang B.L. Wenker J. Torchia D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8517-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and on the known pK values of amino acids free in solution (neglecting pK shifts induced by intrachain interactions), it is possible to calculate the net charge of TGF-β3 as a function of pH using the Henderson-Hasselbach equation. An isoelectric point is estimated for pH = pI ≈ 6.8. The solubility of TGF-β3 at low and high pH values could thus be explained by its large positive or negative electric charge, respectively, at these pH extremes. In contrast, aggregation at physiological pH could be induced by the rather hydrophobic surface of the electrically neutral protein. Analogous calculations for TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 yield isoelectric points of pI ∼ 9.5 and pI ∼ 8.5, respectively. In fact, TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 are distinctly more soluble than TGF-β3 under physiological conditions. The good solubility of TGF-β3 at low pH could explain its prominent rolein vivo in processes involving acidification of the surroundings. The most striking examples are: (i) bone remodeling with pH < 3.0 around the osteoclasts (34ten Dijke P. Iwata K.K. Goddard C. Pieler C. Canalis E. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Mol. Cell.

Ishiwata T. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Gold L.I. Korc M. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).TGF-β2 was the first TGF-β isoform to be crystallized (at pH 4.5). The x-ray analysis yielded a structure with 11% α-helix, 36% β-sheet, 8% helical turns, 3% 310-helical turn and 42% random coil (22Schlünegger M.P. Grutter M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In 1996, the crystal structure of TGF-β3 was also solved (25Mittl P.R. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grutter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Comparison with TGF-β2 revealed, however, only small differences, mainly in the β-loop regions (25Mittl P.R. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grutter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because the percentages of structural elements were not specified by Mittl et al. (1996), TGF-β2 was taken as the starting point for the simulation of the CD spectra. Based on reference CD spectra of 18 globular proteins (31Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar) and using the percentages of the crystal structure, the CD spectrum shown by the dotted line in Fig.4 was calculated. The theoretical spectrum is quite different from the experimental spectrum (solid line), indicating that the TGF-β2/TGF-β3 crystal structure is not a good model for TGF-β3 in solution. A much better fit to the experimental spectrum at pH 4.4 is given by a simulation containing 4% α-helix, 66% β-sheet, 8% β-turns, and 22% random coil (♦ in Fig. 4). Compared with the crystal structure, the α-helical content is reduced and the contribution of β-structures is clearly enhanced. The displacement in the wavelength of the two spectra is due to spectral distortions caused by light scattering of the TGF-β3 aggregates.The simulation of CD spectra is a multiparameter fit, and the relevance of the structural parameters is often subject to criticism. However, CD simulations are biased in sensitivity toward α-helical structures. The decrease of α-helix of TGF-β3 in solution compared with the crystal structure is unambiguous and clearly beyond the error of the numerical approach. A possible explanation for the reduced α-helical content of TGF-β3 in solution is the presence of glycine (Gly-63) in the α-helical region of TGF-β3 between amino acids 57 and 68. This glycine, which confers to the protein backbone additional flexibility, is not present in the α-helical regions of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 (25Mittl P.R. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grutter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).CD spectra of TGF-β3 in solution at pH 1.9 have been reported previously, indicating a much larger helix content (28Runser S. Cerletti N. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1995; 22: 39-53PubMed Google Scholar). We have not been able to confirm these results, which were probably caused by excessive smoothing of the spectra. The present findings are, however, in agreement with 2D-NMR studies of TGF-β3, which suggest an increased molecular flexibility in comparison with TGF-β1. 2M. J. Blommers and T. Arvinte, unpublished results. The considerable structural difference between TGF-β3 in solution and the crystal structure suggests a rather flexible conformation that can adjust itself to external constraints. It could explain the different receptor specificity of TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 despite similar x-ray structures.We have also recorded CD spectra of TGF-β2 in solution at pH 2.96 (data not shown) and have compared them with theoretical spectra calculated on the basis of the crystal structure. In contrast to TGF-β3, a good agreement between the experimental and theoretical spectral shapes was found for TGF-β2. The CD results for TGF-β2 may serve as a positive control for the sensitivity of CD spectroscopy to detect conformational changes for the problem at hand. They emphasize that TGF-β2 adopts the same structure in the crystal and in solution, whereas TGF-β3 reveals two different conformations.The CD spectra of TGF-β3 further demonstrate that the conformation of this protein varies with the pH of the solution. A first conformational change occurs at pH ∼ 4.4 and is accompanied by TGF-β3 aggregation; the second transition begins at pH ∼ 9.8 and is associated with the deprotonation of the solvent-accessible tyrosine residues (8 of 16; see above). At the same time the aggregation process is reversed. The pH-induced aggregation can also be detected with fluorescence spectroscopy using the TGF-β3 Trp residues as intrinsic markers. Aggregation leads to an increase in the steady state polarization and an increase of the fluorescence life time. 3T. Arvinte, unpublished results. A deconvolution of the CD spectra was attempted in the pH ranges of 2.2 ≤ pH ≤ 6.0 and 9 ≤ pH ≤ 10.4 where aggregation was not too pronounced. The relative contributions of the different secondary structures are summarized in Fig. 5. The most prominent change is the increase in β-structure around pH 4.4, which is reversed at pH ∼ 9.8.The destabilization of the β-structure at pH ∼ 9.8 is compensated by an increase in α-helix.Figure 5Variation of the secondary structure of TGF-β3, as a function of pH as derived from CD simulations. ♦, α-helix; ○, β-sheet; ■, β-turns; ●, random coil.

TGF-β3 has a high tendency to adsorb to hydrophobic surfaces and to form large aggregates. At extreme pH values (pH < 2.3 or pH > 11.3) TGF-β3 is monomeric in solution, whereas at pH ∼ 3.9 a monomer ⇄ dimer equilibrium was detected by ultracentrifugation. The addition of salt greatly reduces the solubility of TGF-β3 and enhances its tendency to aggregate. The structure of TGF-β3 in solution is different from the crystal structure; notably, the helix content is reduced, and the β-structure content is increased. The change in conformation of TGF-β3 in solution could explain the different receptor specificity of TGF-β3 compared with TGF-β2 despite their very similar x-ray structure. Transforming growth factors-β (TGF-β)1 are multifunctional cytokines used for cellular communication. They are called growth factors for historical reasons (1Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) but their main function is to control cell proliferation and differentiation (2Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 3Moses H.L. Yang E.Y. Pietenpol J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 245-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and to stimulate the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins (4Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2996) Google Scholar). TGF-β plays a major role in the response of cells and tissues to injury (5Grande J.P. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 214: 27-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Five isoforms of TGF-β are known; however, only three of them are expressed in mammalians. All isoforms show a highly homologous sequence (>70% of conserved residues). For a given isoform the homology between proteins from different species is >95%. The isoforms have similar biological activities but exhibit differences in potency depending on the target cell examined (7Cox D.A. Cell Biol. Int. 1995; 19: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1988; 51: 107-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). TGF-β is produced by virtually all cell types as inactive precursors (1Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 9Bailly S. Brand C. Chambaz E.M. Feige J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16329-16334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and receptors for TGF-β are universally distributed throughout the body. The inactive precursor is first cleaved into a latent complex, which upon activation by acidification represents the regulation step of the signaling process of TGF-β (7Cox D.A. Cell Biol. Int. 1995; 19: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Koppa S.D. Drug Ther. 1994; 2: 34-37Google Scholar). The activation of latent TGF-βin vivo by osteoclasts during bone resorption may be linked to the acidification (pH < 3) of the osteoclast pericellular space (11Gleizes P.E. Munger J.S. Nunes I. Harpel J.G. Mazzieri R. Noguera I. Rifkin D.B. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 12Bonewald L.F. Oreffo R.O. Lee C.H. Park-Snyder S. Twardzik D. Mundy G.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The in vivo activation seems, however, to be more often caused by proteolytic cleavage involving plasmin (13Grainger D.J. Kemp P.R. Liu A.C. Lawn R.M. Metcalfe J.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 460-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) or calpain (14Abe M. Oda N. Sato Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A further mechanism is the enzymatic deglycosylation of the mannose 6-phosphate of the latency associated peptide (15Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In addition, protease-independent conformational changes of the latent complex following binding to thrombospondin (16Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D.

TGF-β2 was the first isoform for which the crystal structure could be solved with x-ray crystallography (18Daopin S. Piez K.A. Ogawa Y. Davies D.R. Science. 1992; 257: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 19Daopin S. Li M. Davies D.R. Proteins. 1993; 17: 176-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Schlünegger M.P.

Next, the solution structure of TGF-β1 was determined by heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (23Archer S.J. Bax A. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Ogawa Y. Piez K.A. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L. Lucas R. Zheng B.L. Wenker J. Torchia D.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1164-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and was found to be very similar to the crystal structure of TGF-β2. The detailed comparison revealed only small differences (mainly in the β-turns) which, however, could play an important role in receptor binding and isoform recognition (24Hinck A.P. Archer S.J. Qian S.W. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L. Lucas R. Zhang B.L. Wenker J. Torchia D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8517-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TGF-β3 was also solved recently (25Mittl P.R. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grutter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Compared with the TGF-β2 crystal no essential differences in the tertiary structure were observed. Minor deviations were detected in the N-terminal α-helix and in the β-sheet loop regions. The well established differences in the biological activity of TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 (25Mittl P.R. Priestle J.P.

The high affinity of HARP for heparin suggests that this secreted polypeptide should also bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans derived from cell surface and extracellular matrix defined as extracellular compartments. Using Western blot analysis, we detected HARP bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular compartments of MDA-MB 231 and MC 3T3-E1 as well as NIH3T3 cells overexpressing HARP protein. Heparitinase treatment of BEL cells inhibited HARP-induced cell proliferation, and the biological activity of HARP in this system was restored by the addition of heparin. We report that heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and to a lesser extent, chondroitin sulfate A, displaced HARP bound to the extracellular compartment. Binding analyses with a biosensor showed that HARP bound heparin with fast association and dissociation kinetics (k ass = 1.6 × 106m−1 s−1;k diss = 0.02 s−1), yielding aK d value of 13 nm; the interaction between HARP and dermatan sulfate was characterized by slower association kinetics (k ass = 0.68 × 106m−1 s−1) and a lower affinity (K d = 51 nm). Exogenous heparin, heparan sulfate, and dermatan sulfate potentiated the growth-stimulatory activity of HARP, suggesting that corresponding proteoglycans could be involved in the regulation of the mitogenic activity of HARP.

Development. 1992; 116: 1175-1183PubMed Google Scholar), possibly because of differences in the cell type used or to the isolation procedure. More recent studies clearly demonstrate that this family of polypeptides have growth-stimulatory activity (16Kurtz A. Schulte A.M. Wellstein A. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1995; 6: 151-177PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity of HARP for heparin suggests that HARP may bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) present in extracellular compartments defined as cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent studies have demonstrated that syndecan-1, syndecan-3 (N-syndecan), and syndecan-4 (ryudocan) bind HARP with high affinity (13Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol.

In addition, biochemical and cell biological studies have pointed to syndecan-3 as the HARP receptor involved in neurite outgrowth activity (19Kinnunen T. Raulo E. Nolo R. Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2243-2248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Despite the correlation derived from previous studies, there has been no direct biochemical demonstration that HARP is trapped in the extracellular compartment as a mitogenic molecule bound to HSPGs. In this study we investigated whether HARP is present in the extracellular compartment as well as the role of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in controlling HARP mitogenic activity. Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Heparin lyase I (Flavobacterium heparinium; EC4.2.2.7), heparin lyase III (F. heparinium; EC4.2.2.8 ), chondroitin ABC lyase (Proteus vulgaris; EC4.2.2.4 ), leupeptin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, heparan sulfate (HS) from bovine intestinal mucosa, keratan sulfate (KS) from bovine cornea, chondroitin sulfate A (CS-A) from bovine trachea, dermatan sulfate (DS) from porcine skin, and chondroitin sulfate C (CS-C) from shark cartilage were purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins were obtained from Diagnostics-Pasteur (Marne la Coquette, France). The affinity-purified HARP antibodies were obtained as described previously by Ledoux (20Ledoux D. Caruelle D. Sabourin J.C. Liu J.F. Crépin M. Barritault D. Courty J. J. Histochem.

FGF2 was a gift from G. Mazue (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bovine epithelial lens (BEL) cells were isolated by the method previously described (21Hughes R.C. Laurent M. Longchamps M.O. Courtois Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of 5 ng/ml FGF2 and were used between passages 10 and 20. NIH3T3 cell lines stably transfected with pJK12 that overexpressed HARP (H-NIH3T3) were cultured as described previously (22Laaroubi K. Delbé J. Vacherot F. Desgranges P. Tardieu M. Jaye M.

Crépin (Bobigny, France), and MC 3T3-E1 cells were a gift from M. Meunier (Lyon, France). The presence of HARP in extracellular compartments defined as cell surface and extracellular matrix was investigated by washing the cells grown to confluency in a 150-cm2 tissue culture dish with 2 × 5 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 2 m NaCl supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 mm EDTA. The 2 m NaCl washes diluted 1:4 and the conditioned medium of cells were incubated for 4 h with 100 μl of 10% (w/v) heparin-Sepharose at 4 °C on a shaker. The heparin-Sepharose was washed four times with 10 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5m NaCl and twice with 10 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions. Samples were boiled for 3 min, and then polypeptides were separated on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels. Polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon P in 50 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, containing 10% methanol for 20 min at 200 V using a semi-dry apparatus Sartoblot II (Sartorius, Palaiseau, France). Membranes saturated with 3% (w/v) gelatin in phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) supplemented by 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 were incubated with 1 μg/ml affinity-purified HARP antibody. Antibodies were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and ECL chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Growth-promoting activity was determined by measuring [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of BEL cells. Cells were seeded at 104/well in 48-well culture plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. After 72 h, the medium was discarded, and the cells were maintained for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. Aliquots of human recombinant HARP were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and added to triplicate wells for 18 h. Cells were then pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine/well for 6 h. Radiolabeled DNA was precipitated with 250 μl of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 20 min at 4 °C, washed with tap water, and solubilized with 250 μl of 0.1 m NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C. [Methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. The effect of GAGs on [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation induced by HARP was investigated essentially as described previously (24Delbé J. Vacherot F. Laaroubi K. Barritault D. Courty J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at least in duplicate. NIH3T3 cells transfected with HARP cDNA were seeded at a density of 4 × 104/cm2 in 150-cm2 tissue culture dishes. After 72 h, confluent cultures were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in DMEM alone or in DMEM containing 1.2 international milliunits/ml heparinase, heparitinase, or chondroitinase ABC or various concentrations of GAGs ranging from 0.1 to 100 μg/ml. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 mNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 mm EDTA. HARP was detected in the extracellular compartments of treated cells by Western blot as described above. ECM was prepared from MC 3T3-E1 cells essentially as described by Vlodavsky (25Vlodavsky I. Folkman J. Sullivan R. Fridman R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Sasse J. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2292-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Briefly, MC 3T3-E1 cells were grown to confluency. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. The ECM was exposed by dissolving the cell layer with 20 mm NH4OH containing 0.05% (v/v) Triton, followed by five washes with PBS. It is noteworthy that using this treatment, no residual cell surface material has been identified on the insoluble matrix (7Wellstein A. Fang W.J. Khatri A. Lu Y. Swain S.S. Dickson R.B. Sasse J. Riegel A.T. Lippman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2582-2587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HARP was extracted by scraping the ECM in Hepes buffer containing 2 m NaCl. Dilutions (1:4) of the 2m NaCl fractions were analyzed by Western blot as described above. MC 3T3-E1 cells were cultured on chamber slides (LabTek, Nunc, Inc). ECM was prepared as described above and fixed in acetone at 4 °C for 10 min. After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with 1.5% (v/v) normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min and 90 min at 37 °C with HARP antibodies (1 μg/ml) diluted in PBS, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. Immunoreactivity was revealed by using the ABC alkaline phosphatase substrate kit 1 supplemented with 1 mm Levamisol. BEL cells were seeded in 48-well plates in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum as described above and incubated for 72 h. The medium was then discarded, and the cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM. Twenty h later the cells were treated with 3 international milliunits/ml heparitinase and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The medium was discarded, and the cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM in the presence of 1.25 ng/ml HARP (ED40: efficiency dose for 40% of maximal stimulation induced by HARP) with or without increasing concentrations of heparin (10 to 104 ng/ml) in triplicate for 18 h, and the incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation was determined as described. Experiments were performed in duplicate. Porcine intestinal mucosa heparin was purified and biotinylated as described (26Kinsella L. Chen H.-L. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DS was biotinylated in a similar fashion. Five hundred μg of DS in 100 μl of distilled water was incubated with 30 μl of a 50 mm solution ofN-hydroxysuccinimide amino caproate-LC biotin (Pierce-Warriner, Chester, UK) in dimethyl sulfoxide for 72 h. Unreacted biotin was removed by fractionation on a Sephadex G-25 column (1 × 25 cm) equilibrated in distilled water, and DS was lyophilized. Biotinylated DS was immobilized on streptavidin-derivatized planar surfaces as described for biotinylated heparin (26Kinsella L. Chen H.-L. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out in an IAsys resonant mirror biosensor at 20 °C using planar biotinylated surfaces derivatized with streptavidin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affinity Sensors, Saxon Hill, Cambridge, UK). HARP binding assays were repeated at least twice. The distribution of the immobilized heparin, DS, and of the bound HARP on the surface of the biosensor cuvette was inspected by examination of the resonance scan, which showed that at all times these molecules were distributed uniformly on the sensor surface and therefore were not microaggregated. Binding assays were as described (27Rahmoune H. Chen H.-L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7303-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the amount of bound HARP is reported in arc s (1 arc s = 1/3600°. Briefly, the ligate, HARP, was added at a known concentration in 100 μl of PBS-T (PBS supplemented with 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20), and then the association reaction was followed over a set time, usually 150 s. The cuvette was then washed twice with 200 μl of PBS-T, and the dissociation of bound ligate into the bulk PBS-T was followed over time. To remove residual bound ligate and thus regenerate the immobilized ligand, the cuvette was washed twice with 200 μl of 2 m NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2. Binding parameters were calculated from the association and dissociation rate constants,k ass and k diss, respectively, using the nonlinear curve-fitting FastFit software (Affinity Sensors) provided with the instrument, as described (27Rahmoune H. Chen H.-L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7303-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). HARP did not itself bind to streptavidin-derivatized surfaces. The presence of HARP in the culture medium conditioned by MDA-MB 231 (7Wellstein A. Fang W.J. Khatri A. Lu Y. Swain S.S. Dickson R.B. Sasse J. Riegel A.T. Lippman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2582-2587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MC 3T3-E1 (28Zhou H.Y. Ohnuma Y. Takita H. Fujisawa R. Mizuno M. Kuboki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1288-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) cells prompted us to determine whether HARP was also present in the 2 m NaCl washes of the surface of these cells, which corresponded to most of the material bound to the ECM and cell surface. In MDA-MB 231 (Fig.1 A) and MC 3T3-E1 cells (Fig.1 B), HARP immunoreactivity was observed both in the conditioned medium (lanes 1) and in the 2 m NaCl washes (lanes 2). Thus, HARP is secreted by cells into the culture medium as well as sequestered in their extracellular compartments. To determine whether HARP was associated with the ECM, the latter was prepared from MC 3T3-E1 cells that produced a substantial ECM and tested for the presence of HARP by immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry of ECM preparations displayed intense staining by anti-HARP (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, no immunostaining was observed when nonspecific antibodies were used (Fig. 2 B) or after a 2 m NaCl wash (result not shown). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2 C, Western blot analysis of 2 m NaCl washes of ECM preparations showed HARP immunoreactivity. The finding that HARP was bound to the extracellular compartments was reminiscent of other heparin binding growth factors like FGF2 (25Vlodavsky I. Folkman J. Sullivan R. Fridman R. Ishai-Michaeli R.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The high affinity of HARP for heparin is consistent with the possibility that this molecule binds to HSPGs. This was investigated by studying the effect of heparinase, heparitinase, and chondroitinase ABC on the release of HARP from H-NIH3T3 cells. Enzyme concentrations optimal for degradation of the relevant GAGs were determined by using 35S-metabolically labeled GAGs derived from H-NIH3T3 (result not shown). Treatment with 1.2 international milliunit/ml heparinase or heparitinase induced the release of HARP from the extracellular compartments of NIH3T3 cells as compared with the buffer alone (Fig. 3). In contrast, treatment with chondroitinase ABC did not cause the release of HARP beyond that observed in buffer alone (Fig. 3). To confirm that HARP binds to extracellular compartments through interactions with HSPGs, we determined whether the exogenous addition of HSPGs could release HARP from cellular binding sites. Cell monolayers of H-NIH3T3 cells were incubated at 4 °C with various GAGs, including HS, KS, heparin, CS-A, DS, or CS-C at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 μg/ml. Incubation with HS or heparin at 10 μg/ml resulted in the efficient release of HARP (Fig.4 A). The same result was observed with 100 μg/ml heparin or HS (result not shown). Studies performed with other GAGs indicated that treatment with DS at 10 μg/ml or 100 μg/ml (result not shown) released a similar amount of HARP as HS (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, CS-A (10 μg/ml) released considerably less HARP and CS-C (10 μg/ml), even less (Fig.4 A). KS (10 μg/ml) was without effect. NaCl (2m) was able to release residual HARP (Fig. 4 B). Quantitative studies using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that DS released up to 84% bound HARP, and HS released 78%. In contrast, treatment with 100 μg/ml CS-A resulted in 40% displacement of bound HARP, and no significant effect was observed with CS-C or KS used at the same concentration (data not shown). The HARP-GAGs interaction was characterized by fast association kinetics, as exemplified by HARP binding to immobilized DS (Fig.5 A). The dissociation of HARP from immobilized DS was also fast (Fig. 5 B). The binding of HARP to heparin and DS was always homogenous; there was no evidence for the presence of more than one binding site for HARP in either of the GAGs (Fig. 5 B and Table I). The association rate constant for the HARP-heparin interaction (k ass = 1.6 (± 0.3) × 106m−1 s−1) was twice as fast as that for the HARP-DS interaction (k ass = 0.68 (± 0.07) × 106m−1s−1) (Table I). The dissociation rate constant of HARP from heparin was slightly slower than that of HARP from DS (Table I). Thus, when the kinetic parameters were used to calculate the affinity of the HARP-GAG interactions, the interaction between HARP and heparin had a considerably higher affinity (K d 13 ± 3 nm) than the interaction between HARP and DS (K d 51 ± 14 nm). TheK D values calculated from the extent of binding observed at equilibrium were very similar to those calculated from the kinetic binding parameters (Table I).Table IKinetics of HARP binding to immobilized heparin and DSk assaThe S.E. of each determination ofk ass is derived from the deviation of the data from a one-site binding model, calculated by matrix inversion using the FastFit software provided with the instrument (“Experimental Procedures”).

In the first set of experiments, we examined whether HARP recognized a structural motif in the GAGs that was also recognized by the archetypal heparin binding growth factor, FGF2. The extent of binding of 111 nm HARP to DS was 97 ± 4 arc s (33Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J.O. Goddard N.J. Biosens. Bioelectronics. 1993; 8: 355-363Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 34Yeung D. Gill A. Maule C.H. Davies R.J. Trends Anal. Chem. 1995; 14: 49-55Google Scholar). The cuvette surface was then saturated with FGF2 by repeatedly adding 167 nm FGF2 until no further binding was observed. The extent of binding of 111 nm HARP to the FGF2 saturated DS surface was similar to that observed in the absence of FGF2, 92 ± 5 arc s. This result suggests that HARP recognizes a structural motif distinct from that recognized by FGF2. The same experiment was performed on the heparin surface. The extent of binding of 55 nm HARP to the heparin surface was 99 ± 3 arc s, whereas only 65 ± 10 arc s HARP bound to the heparin surface saturated with FGF2, suggesting that the structural motifs recognized by HARP and FGF2 in heparin may overlap to a certain extent. In the second set of experiments, the ability of different GAGs to inhibit the binding of 111 nm HARP to immobilized heparin or DS was determined. On immobilized heparin (Fig.5 C), 140 arc s HARP was bound at equilibrium, and soluble heparin was the most effective inhibitor of HARP binding, followed by DS and CS-A. Thus 500 ng/ml heparin inhibited HARP binding by 87%, whereas 50 μg/ml DS and 500 μg/ml CS-A reduced HARP binding by 79%. On immobilized DS (Fig. 5 D), 53 ± 6 arc s HARP was bound at equilibrium, and the rank order of the inhibitory ability of the GAGs on HARP binding was the same as on immobilized heparin. Thus 500 ng/ml heparin inhibited HARP binding by 82%, whereas 5 μg/ml DS was required for 85% inhibition, and 50 μg/ml CS-A for 88% inhibition. We then examined whether HSPGs played a role in the mitogenic response to HARP as demonstrated for the neurite outgrowth activity by studying whether the response of heparitinase-treated BEL cells to HARP was dependent on the presence of heparin. As shown in Fig. 6 A, stimulation induced by 1.25 ng/ml HARP was reduced by 50% in cells pretreated with heparitinase. The addition of heparin in the concentration range from 10 to 104 ng/ml clearly restored and potentiated the mitogenic activity of HARP. Maximum activity with heparin was seen at 100 ng/ml, corresponding to a stimulation of 4.2 times over the control, i.e. cells treated with heparitinase and without the addition of heparin. In contrast, no effect was observed when heparin was added alone to untreated cells at"

This study was conducted to determine the physiological role of α-SNAP in the secretion of insulin and γ-aminobutryric acid (GABA) from pancreatic β cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of total RNA isolated from rat islets disclosed α-SNAP, but not β-SNAP, mRNA expression, and an immunofluorescence study of rat pancreas showed that α-SNAP was present predominantly in the cytoplasm of the islets of Langerhans. α-SNAP overexpression in rat islets enhanced insulin release relative to the control levels. Anin vitro binding study showed that both wild-type α-SNAP and C-terminal–deleted α-SNAP mutant (1–285) can bind to syntaxin 1A. α-SNAP mutant (1–285) was overexpressed to evaluate its activity as dominant-negative effector on insulin release. Overexpression of α-SNAP mutant (1–285) in rat islets and MIN6 cells decreased glucose-stimulated insulin release to about 50% of the control levels. Suppression of endogeneous α-SNAP in MIN6 cells by treatment with an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide resulted in inhibition of insulin release. In order to examine if α-SNAP functions in exocytosis from synaptic-like microvesicles in pancreatic β cells, the functional role of α-SNAP in GABA release from MIN6 cells was studied.

Although insulin release is controlled by a complex array of nervous, nutritional, and hormonal actions, glucose is the most important regulatory signal for insulin secretion. The process of insulin release by pancreatic β cells differs from most secretory mechanisms in other cell types in that a nutrient rather than a hormone acts as the first messenger. A large amount of evidence supports a hypothesis that glucose metabolism, in part, inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels that are expressed in pancreatic β cells, resulting in membrane depolarization and activation of voltage-sensitive l-type Ca2+ channels. Finally, elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i1evokes insulin exocytosis (1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 2Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 3Prentki M.

Thus, although the sensor system for insulin release in pancreatic β cells differs from those in other types of secretory cells (5Malaisse M.J. Sener A. Herchuely A. Hutton J.C. Metabolism. 1979; 28: 373-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), insulin exocytosis by pancreatic β cells is strictly controlled by Ca2+ ions (3Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wollheim C.B. Sharp G.W.G. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 914-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), as in other secretory cells, including those of neuron origin (7Knight D.E. von Grafenstein H. Athayde C.M. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 451-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, the later stages of the process of exocytotic insulin release by pancreatic β cells after [Ca2+]i elevation have been assumed to resemble, although not exactly, exocytotic mechanisms in other secretory cell types, such as neurons. It is now widely accepted that the fundamental components of the machinery required for membrane fusion have been conserved evolutionally and that they are used in both constitutive and regulated membrane trafficking pathways (8Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 9Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). These components includeN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) (10Block M.R. Glick B.S. Wilcox C.A. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7852-7856Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), the soluble NSF attachment proteins (α-, β-, and γ-SNAPs) (11Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T. Buhrow S.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and membrane-associated SNAP receptors (SNAREs) (12Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromag H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar). SNAREs are further divided into two classes of proteins: v-SNAREs (vesicular SNAP receptors) including synaptotagmins, vesicle-associated membrane protein, and related proteins, and t-SNAREs (target SNAP receptors) including syntaxin, SNAP-25, and related proteins. Recent experiments using purified recombinant proteins have led to further characterization of the protein-protein interactions of the SNAREs with each other (13Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 14Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 378: 733-736Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The findings suggest that syntaxin is the major receptor for α-SNAP that is able to stimulate the ATPase activity of NSF (17Morgan A. Dimaline R. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29347-29350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of NSF may be to act as a molecular chaperon to modify the conformation of syntaxin (18Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). According to the original SNARE hypothesis (19Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar, 20Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar), v-SNAREs bind t-SNAREs tightly to form a 7 S complex, which is able to recruit α-SNAP and NSF to form a larger 20 S complex, and finally ATP hydrolysis by NSF then results in SNARE complex disassembly, a late event in the steps leading to membrane fusion during exocytosis. However, recent evidence in the yeast vacuole system had shown that membrane fusion can occur in the presence of v- and t-SNAREs alone (21Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 22Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar); thus, the physiological function of α-SNAP and NSF in exocytosis is now controversial. Although the molecular machinery that triggers insulin exocytosis by endocrine pancreatic β cells is not fully characterized, in situ hybridization, immunoblotting, and Northern blotting studies have revealed that: 1) pancreatic β cells express v-SNAREs, vesicle membrane-associated protein-2, cellubrevin, and synaptotagmins (23Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Berggren P.-O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12487-12491Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 24Mizuta M.

Beaudoin A.R. Bennett M.D. Trimble W.S. Gaisano H.Y. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); 2) t-SNAREs, SNAP-25, and syntaxin are localized in pancreatic β cells, mainly on plasma membranes (27Martin F. Moya F. Gutierrez L.M. Reig J.A. Soria B. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 860-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Nagamatsu S. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Watanabe T. Katahira H. Sawa H. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1160-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); and 3) ATPase NSF and α-SNAP are also expressed in insulinoma cells (29Oho C. Seino S. Takahashi M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 186: 208-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, the SNARE hypothesis for neurotransmitter release may be applicable, at least in part, to insulin exocytosis. However, the two processes are not identical. Synaptic vesicles are recycled and neurotransmitter is transported into them after the endocytosis of fused granules (30Bety M.W. Bewick G.S. Science. 1992; 255: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), whereas there is no obvious evidence for a similar recycling of insulin secretory granules. Also, endocrine pancreatic β cells, which are analogous with neuron, contain both large dense core insulin secretory vesicles (LDCVs) (31Orci L. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 528-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) (32Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. Camilli P.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) which makes them a useful model to study the function of individual SNARE proteins in possibly different forms of exocytosis. In this study, we utilized a recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene transduction system, which enabled expression of high levels of α-SNAP and mutant form in β cells in normal islets or insulinoma cells, and exploited this methodology to evaluate the physiological role of α-SNAP in insulin release via LDCVs and GABA release via SLMVs. An affinity-purified anti-α- and β-SNAP antibody, which was raised against synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues HYEQSADYYKGEE of rat α- and β-SNAP, was a generous gift from Dr. M. Takahashi (Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan). The characterization of this antibody and its specificity have been described (33Nagamatsu S. Nakamichi Y. Katahira H. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Pancreatic islets were isolated from male Wistar rats (200–250 g) by collagenase digestion and Ficoll gradient centrifugation, as described previously (34Nagamatsu S. Steiner D.F. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 748-754PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated islets were placed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11 mm glucose (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. MIN6 cells (a gift from Dr. J-i. Miyazaki, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) at passage 15–25 and βTC3 cells (a gift from Dr. D. Hanahan, University of California, San Francisco, CA) at passage 40∼50 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Total cellular RNA was isolated from rat islets, βTC3 and MIN6 cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63228) Google Scholar). Single-stranded cDNA was prepared from the total RNA (∼100 ng) by reverse transcriptase using random 9-mers in the TaKaRa RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa Shuzo Ltd., Shiga, Japan). The respective sense and antisense degenerate oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-CAAGATGGCCAAGAACTGGA-3′ and 5′-TTCTGTTCCTCATG(G/A)GCTTC-3′, which correspond to amino acid sequences KMAKNWS of Lys53-Ser59 and EAHEEQN of Glu249-Gln255, respectively, of the rat α- and β-SNAP protein sequences obtained from GeneBankTM-entered nucleotide sequences. The PCR reaction involved two initial cycles comprising 94 °C for 15 s, 42 °C for 30 s, and 65 °C for 30 s, followed by 30 cycles comprising 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The 627-base pair PCR products were run on a 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and hybridized with 32P-labeled rat α- or β-SNAP cDNA, which was prepared by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers as probes. Filters were washed under high stringency conditions (0.1 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 msodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, 60 °C) and autoradiographed with intensifying screens. Rat pancreas or isolated rat islets was dissected in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer (pH 7.4), cryoprotected with graded concentrations of sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline, embedded in OCT compound (Miles), and then frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections were cut with a Miles cryostat, transferred to poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and immunostained, as described previously (28Nagamatsu S. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Watanabe T. Katahira H. Sawa H. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1160-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were incubated with rabbit affinity-purified anti-α/β-SNAP antibody (diluted 1:50) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% fetal calf serum, 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by porcine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin coupled to fluorescein. The sections were examined using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope and photographed with Tri-X film (Kodak) rated at 400 ASA. In order to demonstrate clearly the morphological features of the pancreatic tissue or islet cells subjected to immunostaining, each section was photographed using Nomarski optics, as well as fluorescence optics. βTC3 cells were seeded on eight-chamber Permanox slides (Lab Tek, Naperville, IL) coated with poly-l-lysine, infected with recombinant adenoviruses, and incubated for 2 days in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The media were removed, and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then permeabilized with Triton X-100. Then they were incubated with the primary antibody (diluted 1:50) in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 2 h, washed with 2 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody at room temperature for 4 h and finally, the cells on the coverslips were examined using fluorescence microscopy. A 1.2-kilobase cDNA fragment containing the entire coding sequence of bovine α-SNAP (a generous gift from Dr. Rothman, Sloan-Kettering Inst., New York) was ligated into the pAdex1CA cosmid vector (36Niwa H. Yamamura K.-i. Miyazaki J.-i. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4613) Google Scholar), which contains the modified chicken β-actin promoter with cytomegalovirus-IE enhancer (CAG promoter) (a generous gift from Dr. Izumi Saito, Tokyo University Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan). Then, the recombinant adenovirus Adex1CA α-SNAP was prepared by homologous recombination of the expression cosmid cassette and parental viral genome (37Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 38Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), and amplified to achieve a stock with a titer of approximately 109 plaque-forming units/ml. For the construction of α-SNAP mutant, C-terminal truncated α-SNAP mutant (1–285 amino acid residue) was amplified by PCR from a plasmid encoding full-length α-SNAP using the following primers: sense, 5′-GCTATGGACAACTCCGGGA-3′; antisense, 5′-CTCGTCACCCTGGATTTACTTCTTGATGCGCAG-3′. The PCR products were confirmed to be correct by automated sequencing, ligated to the pAdex1CA cosmid vector, and the recombinant adenovirus was constructed as described above. Rat islets, βTC3 and MIN6 cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and the required adenovirus for 2 h at 37 °C, after which, RPMI 1640 medium containing 11 mm glucose was added and 2 days later, the experiments were performed. When βTC3 and MIN6 cells were infected with the adenovirus Adex1CA Lac Z, Lac Z gene expression was observed in nearly 100% of these cells (data not shown). In agreement with report from another laboratory (39Becker T.C. BeltrandelRio H. Noel R.J. Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21234-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat islets infected with Adex1CA Lac Z and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside were a clear blue color in more than 70% of infected cells (data not shown). Furthermore, insulin biosynthesis and secretion by rat islets infected with Adex1w, which contains no foreign genes, were almost the same as those by non-infected islets on post-infection day 2 (data not shown). Therefore, in this study, rat islets and cultured cells infected with Adex1w were used as controls. Two days after infection, the incubation media were removed, the islets or cultured cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium and preincubated with 2.2 mmglucose for 2 h. Tissues were then challenged with 2.2 or 22 mm glucose alone, or 22 mm glucose + 20 μm forskolin for 1 h. The forskolin was added to evoke a near-maximal response. The media were collected at the end of the challenge period, the cells were disrupted by sonication, and aliquots of media and cell extracts were analyzed for immunoreactive insulin (IRI) by radioimmunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Medical Biology Laboratory (MBL), Nagoya, Japan). In some experiments, insulin release was expressed as the fractional secretion rate per hour, derived from the following equation: total IRI secreted/final IRI in islets + total IRI secreted. Bioanalytical systems HPLC (System Gold; Beckman instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) was used to analyze GABA in MIN6-conditioned Hank's media by a modified isocratic procedure with electrochemical detection (40Kehr J. Ungerstedt U. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1308-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μl of sample was mixed with 10 μl of derivatization reagent (4 mm o-phthalaldehyde and 2-mercaptoethanol) 2.5 min before injection onto a 4.6 × 150-mm MA-5ODS column (Eicom Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). Mobile phase (pH 3.5) was 0.05 msodium phosphate buffer with 50% methanol delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Quantitation was by electrochemical detection, using a glass carbon electrode set at 0.60 V. Rat islets, βTC3 and MIN6 cells were disrupted by sonication, boiled in SDS sample buffer with 10 mm dithiothreitol, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and then transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The filters were incubated with the required primary antibody, followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA). All the syntaxin binding samples were run in duplicate. Maltose-binding protein-fused syntaxin 1A was attached to amylose resin-agarose beads as described previously (28Nagamatsu S. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Watanabe T. Katahira H. Sawa H. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1160-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The beads were washed three times with binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.15 μm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100) and resuspended in 400 μl of binding buffer containing protease inhibitors (500 μg/liter pepstatin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and approximately 50–150 ng α-SNAP and/or α-SNAP mutant proteins and rotated (head over head) overnight at 4 °C. The beads in the pellet fraction were washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer, the bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti- α/β-SNAP antibody. The antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (5′-TCCATGACGTCGCGCAGCTGC-3′) complementary to the mouse α-SNAP sequence surrounding the initiation codon and the corresponding sense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide were designed based on the α-SNAP cDNA sequence. They were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystem Instruments) and purified by reverse phase high-pressure liquid column chromatography. For antisense experiments, MIN6 cells were treated with a mixture of FuGeneTM (Boehringer-Mannheim) and 50 μm of each oligonucleotide for 24 h. The medium was renewed and 20 μm of each oligonucleotide was added to the renewed medium every 24 h. After 7 days, the treated MIN6 cells were challenged by 2.2 or 22 mm glucose for 1 h and subjected to IRI and immunoblot analysis. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. from at least three different experiments performed independently on at least three different cell preparations, unless stated otherwise. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test and ANOVA in multiple comparisons. We initially studied the expression of α/β-SNAP mRNA in the islets of Langerhans, insulinoma βTC3 and MIN6 cells using RT-PCR analysis. The cDNAs reverse-transcribed from the total RNAs isolated from rat islets, βTC3 and MIN6 cells were amplified with degenerate oligonucleotide primers, which were designed to bind to α- and β-SNAP cDNAs simultaneously, and the PCR products were hybridized with the rat α- or β-SNAP cDNA probe. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the insulinoma βTC3 and MIN6 cells expressed both α- and β-SNAP mRNAs, whereas rat islets expressed only α-SNAP mRNA. Although the EtBr-stained gel showed a single band in all lanes (data not shown), the autoradiogram from the islets lane showed 2 bands. The upper band above the 627-base pair DNA fragment may have been an unknown isoform of SNAP or an alternatively spliced form, although Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from 500 islets showed a weak single band (data not shown). To verify whether rat islets express β-SNAP, we utilized specific oligonucleotide primers based on the rat β-SNAP cDNA sequence obtained by RT-PCR analysis. This method confirmed the lack of expression of β-SNAP in the islets (data not shown). The α/β-SNAP protein levels in the islets and insulinoma cell lines were evaluated by performing immunoblot analysis of total cellular protein. Fig.1 B shows that MIN6 cells (105 cells) expressed an appreciable amount of α-SNAP protein, although, βTC3 (105 cells) and rat islets (∼109 cells/100 islets) expressed relatively low levels of this protein. A single band of α-SNAP protein with a molecular mass of ∼35 kDa was detected in all the cell lysates, but the β-SNAP band was barely detectable in βTC3 and MIN6 cell lysates. Thus, pancreatic β cells predominantly expressed α-SNAP. In order to determine the localization of α-SNAP protein in rat pancreas, we performed an immunofluorescence study. Immunohistochemical staining of rat pancreas sections revealed the presence of α-SNAP in the cytoplasm of the islets of Langerhans (Fig.2). There was little positive staining of α-SNAP in the exocrine cells.Figure 2Immunofluorescence photomicrograph of rat pancreas immunostained with anti-α/β-SNAP antibody.Sections of rat pancreas were incubated with rabbit preimmune serum, or affinity-purified anti-α/β-SNAP antibody, followed by fluorescence-conjugated bovine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin.A, anti-α/β-SNAP antibody; B, preimmune serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Overexpression of α-SNAP in rat islets was achieved utilizing an adenovirus-mediated gene transduction system, as demonstrated by immunoblotting with antibodies against α/β-SNAP (Fig. 3). Infecting islets with the Adex1CA α-SNAP recombinant adenovirus resulted in a 10–20-fold increase in the level of the protein relative to that of control islets infected with the Adex1w control adenovirus. The efficiency of the recombinant adenovirus system for gene transfer into mammalian cells and isolated rat islets was previously evaluated (39Becker T.C. BeltrandelRio H. Noel R.J. Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21234-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with those results, more than 70% of the islet cells infected with Adex1CA β-GAL were stained blue which was a slightly lower level than that of insulinoma cells (MIN6 and βTC3), which were near 100% (data not shown). To confirm the efficiency of the adenovirus treatment in isolated islets, rat islets infected with the recombinant adenovirus were examined by immunofluorescence studies. Fig.4 shows α-SNAP immunostaining of islet cells infected with Adex1w or Adex1CA α-SNAP. Strong immunostaining for AdexlCA α-SNAP was observed in more than 90% of the cells in islets infected with Adex 1CA α-SNAP. By contrast, only weak immunostaining was observed in Adex1w-infected islets. Phase-contrast studies showed similar results. To show that adenovirus-mediated overexpression does not affect protein targeting or sorting, we compared the immunofluorescence of endogeneous α-SNAP protein to that of α-SNAP overexpressed in βTC3 cells. As shown in Fig.5, in cells infected with Adex1CA α-SNAP, the immunoreactivity for α-SNAP was observed only in the cytoplasm similar to the distribution of endogenous α-SNAP in uninfected cells.Figure 4Immunofluorescence photomicrograph of adenovirus-infected isolated rat islets stained with anti-α/β-SNAP antibody.

Insulin release by islets infected with Adex1CA α-SNAP in response to 22 mm glucose alone or 22 mm glucose plus 20 μm forskolin increased by approximately 128 or 144% Adex1w-infected control levels, respectively, (22 mm gl"
https://openalex.org/W2045141872,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 encodes a heterotrimeric helicase-primase complex that is composed of the products of the UL5, UL52, and UL8genes. A subcomplex consisting of the UL5 and UL52 proteins retains all the enzymatic activities exhibited by the holoenzyme in vitro. The UL52 protein contains a putative zinc finger at its C terminus which is highly conserved among both prokaryotic and eukaryotic primases. We constructed a mutation in which two highly conserved cysteine residues in the zinc finger motif were replaced with alanine residues. A UL52 expression plasmid containing the mutation in the zinc finger region is unable to support the growth of aUL52 mutant virus in a transient complementation assay. Wild type and mutant UL5·UL52 subcomplexes were purified from insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. Surprisingly, the mutant protein was severely affected in all biochemical activities tested; no helicase or primase activities could be detected, and the mutant protein retains only about 9% of wild type levels of single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Gel mobility shift assays showed that DNA binding is severely affected as well; the mutant subcomplex only retains approximately 8% of wild type levels of binding to a forked substrate. On the other hand, the mutant protein retains its ability to interact with UL5 as indicated by copurification and with UL8 as indicated by a supershifted band in the gel mobility shift assay. In addition, the ability of individual subunits to bind single-stranded DNA was examined by photo cross-linking. In the wild type UL5·UL52 subcomplex, both subunits are able to bind an 18-mer of oligo(dT). The mutant subcomplex was severely compromised in the ability of both UL5 and UL52 to bind the oligonucleotide; total cross-linking was only 2% of wild type levels. These results are consistent with the proposal that the putative zinc binding motif of UL52 is required not only for binding of the UL52 subunit to DNA and for primase activity but also for optimal binding of UL5 to DNA and for the subsequent ATPase and helicase activities.

A UL52 expression plasmid containing the mutation in the zinc finger region is unable to support the growth of aUL52 mutant virus in a transient complementation assay. Wild type and mutant UL5·UL52 subcomplexes were purified from insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. Surprisingly, the mutant protein was severely affected in all biochemical activities tested; no helicase or primase activities could be detected, and the mutant protein retains only about 9% of wild type levels of single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Gel mobility shift assays showed that DNA binding is severely affected as well; the mutant subcomplex only retains approximately 8% of wild type levels of binding to a forked substrate. On the other hand, the mutant protein retains its ability to interact with UL5 as indicated by copurification and with UL8 as indicated by a supershifted band in the gel mobility shift assay. In addition, the ability of individual subunits to bind single-stranded DNA was examined by photo cross-linking. In the wild type UL5·UL52 subcomplex, both subunits are able to bind an 18-mer of oligo(dT). The mutant subcomplex was severely compromised in the ability of both UL5 and UL52 to bind the oligonucleotide; total cross-linking was only 2% of wild type levels. These results are consistent with the proposal that the putative zinc binding motif of UL52 is required not only for binding of the UL52 subunit to DNA and for primase activity but also for optimal binding of UL5 to DNA and for the subsequent ATPase and helicase activities. herpes simplex virus polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cytomegalovirus single-stranded dithiothreitol plaque-forming units kilobase pairs Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)1 encodes a heterotrimeric DNA helicase-primase complex composed of the products of the UL5, UL52, and UL8 genes (1Crute J.J.

Taken together, these results suggest that UL5encodes the helicase subunit and that UL52 encodes the primase subunit of the helicase-primase complex; however, neither UL5 nor UL52 appears to possess any of these activities when expressed and purified alone (8Dodson M.S. Crute J.J. Bruckner R.C. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20835-20838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1105-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus it is not clear whether UL52 contributes a specific function to helicase activity or whether UL5 contributes a function to primase activity. It is also possible that amino acid residues from both polypeptides actually contribute to the catalytic activities of the complex or that each polypeptide needs the other for proper folding and conformation. Unwinding of duplex DNA by a helicase is an essential step in many biological processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, recombination, and transcription. Although the precise mechanism of unwinding is unknown for any helicase, it is clear that the unwinding reaction requires the coupling of several simpler events such as ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, single strand and double strand DNA binding, and translocation along the DNA. One model for helicase activity poses that helicases must utilize at least two distinct DNA-binding sites (24Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that helicases achieve this by forming oligomeric structures, either dimer, hexamer, or multiprotein complexes. The Rep protein of Escherichia coli, also a member of Superfamily I, is believed to form a dimer (25Wong I. Chao K.L. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wong I. Lohman T.M. Science. 1992; 256: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) at the replication fork, whereas the helicases of T4 and T7 bacteriophages (27Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dong F. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol.

Virol. 1997; 71: 8766-8773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) apparently form hexamers or higher order structures. The stoichiometry of the UL5·UL52·UL8 heterotrimeric complex at the replication fork is not known nor is it known which proteins or domains within each protein are capable of contacting the DNA substrate. It is possible that the UL5 subunit itself contains all the DNA binding regions required for helicase activity and that the UL52 subunit has a DNA binding region associated with primase activity. However, it is also possible that the UL52 protein contains a DNA binding domain required for helicase activity. In this paper we developed a photo cross-linking assay and used it to demonstrate that both UL5 and UL52 subunits of the helicase-primase subcomplex are capable of contacting DNA. The UL52 protein contains a putative zinc finger motif at its C terminus that is highly conserved among herpesviruses and also other primases such as the bacteriophage primases, mouse, and yeast primases (31Ilyina T.V. Gorbaleyna A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 32Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Zinc finger motifs have been implicated in sequence-specific DNA recognition by several proteins including transcription factors (33Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar, 34Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 35Qian X. Gozani S.N.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7842-7851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Specifically, the zinc finger motif in the bacteriophage T7 primase has been shown to be responsible for template recognition (32Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed mutational analysis of the putative zinc finger region of UL52 to assess the role of this motif in the DNA-binding properties of the helicase-primase complex. We found that substitution of two highly conserved cysteine residues within the motif with alanine abolishes the in vivo DNA replication activity of UL52, indicating that this motif is essential in vivo. The mutant protein subcomplex exhibits severe defects in DNA binding, ATPase, helicase, and primase activities. These results suggest the essential role of the putative zinc finger motif in the biochemical activities of the helicase-primase subcomplex.

Risano C. Seelig G. Lee C.G. Kwong A.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4261-4268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to generate an amplicon vector capable of expressing UL52 (pF1′-UL52), pcDNA1-UL52 was digested withBamHI and HpaI, and the 3.5-kb fragment was subcloned into pF1′-CMV digested with EcoRV andBglII. Mutations were constructed by a two-step polymerase chain reaction method (42Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K.

The outside primers were OZnFM3 (5′ GCATCGAAACCCACTTTCCCGAACA 3′) and OZnM4 (5′ GCGGCCGAGACGAGCGAGTTAGACA 3′). The mutagenic primers were as follows: OZnM1 (5′ CAGCAGGCATTCGCCGCCAAAGCAGACAGCAACC 3′) and OZnM2 (5′ TTGCTGTCTGCTTTGGCGGCGAATGCCTGCTGACACAAGGA 3′). The mutations resulting in coding changes are underlined; a silent change resulting in the introduction of a BsmI site is indicated by a double underline. The mutated polymerase chain reaction products were digested with Blp1 and HindIII, and the 603-base pair fragment was subcloned into pF1′-UL52. The clone was confirmed by the presence of the new BsmI restriction site. Sequencing of the 603-base pair region confirmed that no spontaneous mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction. The mutant plasmid was designated as pF1′-UL52(CC3,4AA). pF1′-UL52(CC3,4AA) was digested with HindIII andNotI, and the resulting 3.7-kb fragment containing theUL52(CC3,4AA) gene was cloned into pFastBac1, a baculovirus transfer vector (4.8 kb, Life Technologies, Inc.), to generate UL52(CC3,4AA)FastBac. This transfer vector was then used to generate a baculoviral stock, AcUL52(CC3,4AA), capable of expressing the mutant UL52 protein as described previously (14Graves-Woodward K.L. Gottlieb J.

Two liters of Sf9 cells were grown in suspension at 27 °C in Graces' insect medium as described previously (14Graves-Woodward K.L. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. Weller S.K. J. Biol.

The wild type UL5·UL52 and the UL5·UL52(CC3,4AA) subcomplexes were purified essentially as described earlier except that a UnoQ (Bio-Rad) column was used in place of the Mono Q column (14Graves-Woodward K.L.

Cells were Dounced using 15 strokes of a tight-fitting pestle in buffer A, and the cytosolic extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 ×g for 30 min. The UL5·UL52 subcomplexes were fractionated from the cytosolic extract by adding equal volume of buffer B containing 0.2 m NaCl and 2 m ammonium sulfate on ice for 4 h. The resultant protein pellets were resuspended in buffer B containing 0.1 m NaCl and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto a 20-ml SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.1 m NaCl, and the column was washed with 5 column volumes of the equilibration buffer. Fractions containing the UL5·UL52 subcomplex were identified by both ATPase assay and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The UL5·UL52 subcomplex elutes from the column in the void volume. Pooled fractions from SP-Sepharose were loaded onto a 12-ml Uno Q column equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.1 m NaCl. The column was washed with 60 ml of buffer B containing 0.1 mNaCl, and the protein was eluted using a 185-ml linear gradient of buffer B containing 0.1–1 m NaCl.

The forked DNA substrate was constructed by heat denaturing and annealing 80 pmol of the helicase 48FS oligo (5′CAGTCACGACGTTGTAGAGCGACGGCCAGTCGGTTATTGCATGAAAGC 3′) radiolabeled at its 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP and 80 pmol of the unlabeled 48C/FS oligo (5′ CGAAAGTACGTTATTGCGACTGGCCGTCGCTCTACAACGTCGTGACTG 3′). The underlined residues are complementary and create a duplex region of the molecule. After annealing, the products were subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the forked substrate was purified by electroelution and ethanol precipitation. Reactions containing varying amounts (1–8 pmol) of the UL5·UL52 subcomplex (wild type or mutant) were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C and were analyzed as described previously (14Graves-Woodward K.L.

The reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 20 mm Na+ HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 pmol (molecules) of the forked DNA substrate labeled at its 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP, and 4 pmol of the UL5·UL52 subcomplex (wild type or mutant) with or without 12 pmol of the UL8 protein. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min on ice and was terminated by the addition of 0.1 volume of stop solution (80% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Reaction products were analyzed on a 4% nondenaturing acrylamide, 0.11% Bis-gel at 150 V at 4 °C. The gel was dried and exposed to film at −70 °C. The transient complementation assay was performed as described previously (44Martinez R. Shao L. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6735-6746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly trypsinized exponentially growing Vero cells (1 × 106) were transfected in solution with 8 μg of either pF1′-CMV, pF1′-UL52, or pF1′-UL52(CC3,4AA). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were superinfected with hr114 at a multiplicity of infection of 3 pfu per cell. At 16 h post-infection at 34 °C, progeny viruses were harvested and titered on the complementing BL-1 cell line. Vero cells (1 × 106) were transfected as described above and superinfected with hr114 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 pfu per cell at 24 h post-transfection. At 16 h post-infection at 34 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman TJ-6 centrifuge. For infection, 1.5 × 106 Vero cells in 60-mm plates were infected with KOS or with hr114 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 pfu per cell. Cell pellets were rinsed with PBS (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3) and resuspended in 50 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). The samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were blotted onto ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Corp., Buckinghamshire, UK). ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) Western blotting analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) instructions. An antibody detected against the C-terminal 10 amino acids of UL52, 1248 (generously provided by Dr. Mark Challberg) was used as primary antibody at a dilution of 1:250. A photo cross-linking experiment was performed with oligo(dT)18 in which the 5th thymidine residue from the 5′ end was substituted with 5-iododeoxyuridine; the substituted oligo was labeled at its 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP. A 4-pmol aliquot of UL5·UL52 subcomplex (wild type or mutant) was incubated with 1.0 pmol of the labeled substituted oligo in 20 mmNa+ HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA for 10 min on ice before irradiation. An IK series He-Cd laser (IK 3302R-E, KIMMON, Kimmon Electric Co., Ltd.) was used to achieve monochromatic 325 nm light. The laser beam output was 34 milliwatts measured with a power meter, Mentor MA10, Scientech® (Scientech, Inc., Boulder, CO). Sample volumes of 200 μl were irradiated in a methacrylate cuvette (Fisher brand, catalog number 14-385-938) at room temperature. At different time points 40-μl aliquots were withdrawn, boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel. The gels were dried and exposed to film at −70 °C. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to explore the functional significance of the putative zinc finger region of the UL52 protein. The sequence of the HSV-1 UL52 gene product was compared with its homologs from 10 other herpesviruses, and a putative zinc finger was identified beginning at Cys988(Cys-X 4-His-X 29-Cys-X 4-Cys). Three cysteine residues, Cys988, Cys1023, and Cys1028 within this region are totally conserved among all UL52 homologs and are designated as C1, C3, and C4, respectively (Fig.1). Histidine 993 (designated as H2) was also conserved in 9 out of 10 UL52 homologs. A similar potential metal-binding site was also highly conserved in DNA primases of bacteriophages, other eukaryotic viruses, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes (31Ilyina T.V. Gorbaleyna A.E. Koonin E.V. J.

The location of sorting signals in LPH was investigated by preparing a series of mutants that lacked the LPH cytoplasmic domain or had the cytoplasmic domain of LPH replaced by sequences that comprised basolateral targeting signals and overlapping internalization signals of various potency. These signals are mutants of the cytoplasmic domain of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA), which have been shown to be dominant in targeting HA to the basolateral membrane. The LPH-HA chimeras were expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and colon carcinoma (Caco-2) cells, and their transport to the cell surface was analyzed. All of the LPH mutants were targeted correctly to the apical membrane. Furthermore, the LPH-HA chimeras were internalized, indicating that the HA tails were available to interact with the cytoplasmic components of clathrin-coated pits. The introduction of a strong basolateral sorting signal into LPH was not sufficient to override the strong apical signals of the LPH external domain or transmembrane domains. These results show that basolateral sorting signals are not always dominant over apical sorting signals in proteins that contain each and suggest that sorting of basolateral from apical proteins occurs within a common compartment where competition for sorting signals can occur.

All of these signals are located in the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane glycoproteins. In addition to basolateral signals, three types of signals for sorting proteins to the apical surface of epithelial cells, or axon of neurons, are known. Glycolipid anchors direct proteins to the apical surface of several types of epithelial cells (17Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), although this mechanism does not apply to all secreted proteins (23Soole K.L. Hall J. Jepson M.A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J.

For many transmembrane glycoproteins, deletion of cytoplasmic sequences containing a basolateral sorting signal results in efficient transport of the protein to the apical surface, rather than the random transport expected for the deletion of specific sorting information (10Prill V. Lehmann L. von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Mostov K.E. de Bruyn Kops A. Deitcher D.L.

Mulligan M.J. Compans R.W. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1997; 13: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For other proteins, deletion of cytoplasmic sequences caused randomized transport, proving that transport to the apical surface does not occur by default (9Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. J.

In the reverse approach, introducing basolateral sorting signals into the cytoplasmic domain of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA)1 was shown to have a dominant effect over apical sorting information (8Lin S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26300-26305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations implied that some proteins carry apical sorting information that is recessive to cytoplasmic basolateral sorting signals. Basolateral signals could dominate over apical signals simply by being recognized earlier in the biosynthetic pathway, or sorting could occur in a common compartment where basolateral signals might bind tighter to the sorting machinery than apical signals. To investigate these questions, we attached a series of basolateral sorting signals to the strictly polarized membrane protein of small intestinal epithelial cells, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH, EC3.2.1.23-3.2.1.62), and determined their effect on the sorting of LPH. LPH, an integral type I membrane glycoprotein, is 1927 amino acids long containing a membrane anchor of 19 contiguous hydrophobic amino acids and a cytoplasmic domain of 26 amino acids. It is synthesized as a precursor with apparent molecular masses of 215 and 230 kDa, representing the mannose-rich (pro-LPHh) and complex (pro-LPHc) glycosylated forms. Maturation of LPH involves proteolytic cleavage after complex glycosylation of the precursor to yield the brush-border form of 160 kDa (33Danielsen E.M. Skovbjerg H. Noren O. Sjöström H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A.M. Marxer A. J.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). LPH is targeted strictly to the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (38Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A.M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the position and relative strength of the apical sorting signal of LPH, sorting of a tailless LPH mutant (LPH−ct) (39Naim H.Y. Naim H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 198-208PubMed Google Scholar) and chimeric proteins made by fusing LPH external and transmembrane sequences to the short, 12-amino acid-long cytoplasmic domain of several HA mutants was studied in MDCK cells. Wild type HA lacks basolateral sorting signals and is transported to the apical surface (40Roth M.G. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Giusti L. Davis A. Nayak D. Compans R.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but point mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of HA were identified that created both internalization signals and dominant basolateral sorting signals (8Lin S. Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26300-26305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Brewer C.B. Thomas D. Roth M.G. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast to their function in HA, these basolateral sorting signals did not affect strict apical delivery of LPH. However, the chimeric LPH proteins gained the internalization capacity similar to those of the HA counterparts. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were employed according to Sambrook et al. (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The LPH mutant lacking the cytoplasmic tail, LPH−ct, has been reported previously (39Naim H.Y. Naim H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 198-208PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the external and transmembrane domain of LPH (amino acids 1–1901) (45Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Bol W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and the short, 12-amino acid-long, cytoplasmic domain of HA (amino acids 536–547) (36Naim H. Amarneh B. Ktistakis N.T. Roth M.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7585-7588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (denoted as LPH-HA) were generated by polymerase chain reaction SOEing (46Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product encoding LPH-HAwt was cloned into the expression vector pJB20 (32Brewer C.B. Thomas D. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A similar strategy was utilized to construct the LPH-HA chimeras which contain a single mutation (LPH-HAY543) or a double mutation (LPH-HAY543/Y546 and LPH-HAY543/R546) in the HA cytoplasmic domain. The sequence of LPH−ct and each LPH-HA chimera was determined by sequencing with a Sequenase kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). MDCK cells and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein/Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of the appropriate recombinant DNA using DEAE-dextran (for COS-1 cells) as described (47Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Polybrene (for MDCK cells) (38Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A.M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected MDCK cells were selected in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml active G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and after 18–23 days, surviving colonies were isolated with cloning rings. Stable transformants expressing LPH−ct or LPH-HA chimeras were screened by immunoprecipitation and by immunofluorescence staining. Expression of LPH-HA chimeras in intestinal Caco-2 cells was preformed transiently on membrane filters using the calcium phosphate procedure (48Low S.H. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Subramaniam N. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13391-13396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the cells were grown to confluency and the corresponding DNA was added at 2 μg/ml. For higher transfection efficiency on filters, the cells were treated prior to transfection with trypsin to dissociate the cells and to achieve an optimal exposure of cells to DNA. Three days post-transfection the cells were processed for cell surface immunoprecipitation with mAb anti-LPH (see below) after biosynthetic labeling for 18 h. We found that a 3-day period was sufficient for the cell layer to achieve complete polarity. This was biochemically assessed by cell surface immunoprecipitation of sucrase-isomaltase, which is targeted in Caco-2 cells to the apical membrane. Infection of Caco-2 cells with HA cDNA was performed as described by Naim and Roth (42Naim H. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for MDCK cells. Metabolic labeling of MDCK cells grown on filters or plated in six-well culture dishes was performed as described previously (38Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A.M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MDCK clones expressing LPH−ct or LPH-HA chimeras were labeled for 1 h with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (10 mCi/mll-[35S]RedivueTMPro-mixTM, Amersham, Braunschweig/Germany) and chased for different times with unlabeled methionine. Caco-2 cells expressing transiently transfected LPH-HAwt or LPH-HAY543/F546 were labeled continuously for 18 h to ensure a maximum labeling of the expressed recombinant proteins. Caco-2 cells infected with HAwt or HAY543/F546 were continuously labeled for 2 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mouse mAb anti-LPH (from hybridoma HBB 1/900/34/74) (34Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A.M. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) as described by Naim et al. (47Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cell surface antigens were immunoprecipitated from intact cells on filters by addition of anti-LPH or anti-HA (42Naim H. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) antibody to either the apical or basolateral compartments. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the gels were fixed, soaked in 16% salicylic acid for signal amplification, and subjected to fluorography. MDCK-ML cells expressing LPH were biosynthetically labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine and chased over several time points. The cells were solubilized in the cold for 2 h with 1% Triton X-100 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. The detergent extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-LPH. The pellet was dissolved by boiling in 1% SDS for 10 min. Thereafter 10-fold volume of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 was added. These extracts were centrifuged and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies, MLac 6 and MLac 10, that recognize denatured and native forms of LPH (39Naim H.Y. Naim H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 198-208PubMed Google Scholar). A similar experimental procedure was followed to assess the detergent solubility of intestinal brush-border sucrase-isomaltase by using the colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells. Immunoprecipitation of native and denatured forms of sucrase-isomaltase was performed with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies (34Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A.M. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 5% or 6% gels. COS-1 cells transiently transfected with pJB20 encoding LPH−ct or the LPH-HA chimeras were grown in duplicate on coverslips. 48 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed in ice-cold DMEM and placed on ice. The cells were incubated for 2 h with mAb anti-LPH diluted 1:200 in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Unbound antibody was removed by three washes with DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Control samples were retained at 4 °C and for a second set of samples the temperature was raised to 37 °C with DMEM for 10 min in a circulating water bath. The cells were chilled on ice, rinsed in ice-cold PBS, and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany), diluted 1:100 in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Intracellular localization of proteins was assessed in transfected cells that were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 after fixing. The cells were examined with an Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a 100× immersion objective. To evaluate the role of the cytoplasmic tail of LPH in its transport and sorting, we constructed a mutant cDNA lacking the entire sequence encoding the cytoplasmic tail of LPH (denoted pro-LPH−ct, TableI) and found that in COS-1 cells this deletion did not affect the transport-competence of the molecule (39Naim H.Y. Naim H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 198-208PubMed Google Scholar). Biosynthetic processing of LPH−ct in a MDCK cell line continuously expressing the protein was similar to that of wild type pro-LPH in intestinal and MDCK cells (35Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 38Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A.M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first detectable biosynthetic form, the 215-kDa mannose-rich pro-LPH−ctspecies, chased into the complex glycosylated 230-kDa pro-LPH–ct polypeptide after 4–6 h, and a cleaved form of LPH−ct (approximate apparent molecular mass 160 kDa) appeared (Fig. 1). The cleaved 160-kDa form is the tailless analogue of LPHβ previously characterized in intestinal biopsy specimens (35Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem.

The kinetics of appearance of pro-LPH−ct in the apical or basolateral domains were investigated by cell surface immunoprecipitation of pro-LPH−ct and its derivative LPHβ−ct from cells grown on transparent polyester membrane filters as described previously for wild type LPH (38Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A.M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows that the complex glycosylated 230-kDa pro-LPH−ct precursor and LPHβ−ctappeared after 4 h of chase at the apical surface. The intensity of the bands isolated from the apical domain became stronger at the 6-h chase point. No significant bands corresponding to these two LPH species were detected at the basolateral surface. Together, the pulse-chase and sorting analyses indicate that intracellular processing and targeting of pro-LPH−ct in MDCK cells is similar to its wild type pro-LPH counterpart and that the cytosolic portion of pro-LPH is devoid of apical sorting signals. A number of apically sorted proteins, such as influenza virus neuraminidase, HA, and some intestinal proteins, have been shown to be selectively associated with sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts (21Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar, 51Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev.

One of the characteristics of these protein-membrane structures is their insolubility in detergents such as Triton X-100 at 4 °C. We therefore examined whether pro-LPH is associated with rafts in the polarized cell line MDCK-ML that expresses pro-LPH (38Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A.M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h and chased for various time points. The cells were extracted with Triton X-100, and the detergent solubility of pro-LPH biosynthetic forms versus insolubility was examined. Fig. 3 shows two representative chase time points. The 215-kDa mannose-rich pro-LPH appeared in the supernatant fraction (denoted S) at the earliest chase time point (1 h pulse, 0 h chase), and the pellet (P) was devoid of this form. The complex glycosylated 230-kDa pro-LPH was also found exclusively in the supernatant after 4 h of chase together with the mannose-rich 215-kDa species. Similar results were obtained with chase points earlier and later than 4 h. The absence of pro-LPH in the detergent insoluble fraction (P) indicates that pro-LPH is not associated with sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts. These data agree with previous observations that pro-LPH was only found in the detergent-soluble form in biosynthetically labeled explants from the pig small intestine (52Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). By contrast to pro-LPH, the 245-kDa complex glycosylated mature form of another brush-border protein, sucrase-isomaltase (34Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A.M. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 53Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could be found in the Triton X-100 insoluble pellet (P) after 3 h of chase in biosynthetically labeled intestinal Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3). The mannose-rich form (210-kDa), on the other hand, was found only in the supernatant (Fig.3). This result indicates that the 245-kDa mature form of sucrase-isomaltase is associated with sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts and suggests a role of these structures in the targeting of this glycoprotein to the apical membrane, but not in the sorting of LPH. The high fidelity of sorting of LPH (more than 90% was apically targeted) and its cleaved product (exclusively apically located) strongly suggest that this protein contains strong apical sorting signals. The strength and efficiency of the basolateral sorting machinery has lead to the notion that basolateral signals are dominant over apical signals in MDCK cells. Consistent with this concept, HA mutants constructed to contain basolateral signals were sorted to the basolateral rather than the apical membrane (8Lin S. Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26300-26305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To examine the strength of the potential apical sorting signal within the LPH molecule, the same cytosolic sequences that completely reversed the polarity of HA were fused to the ectodomain and transmembrane domain of pro-LPH (the chimeras are indicated LPH-HA).

The membrane-proximal 133-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of glycoprotein (gp) 130, containing one copy of the Box3 motif, is sufficient to transmit a productive signal to endogenous APP genes in rat hepatoma H-35 cells. In contrast, a mutant gp130 domain lacking the Box3 motif activates Janus kinases to a normal level but fails to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and to up-regulate a number of APP genes, including thiostatin, fibrinogen, hemopexin, and haptoglobin. However, in the absence of Box3, gp130 still stimulates the expression of α2-macroglobulin and synergizes with IL-1 to up-regulate α1-acid glycoprotein. The Box3 motif is not required for activation of the SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 or the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nor is the immediate induction of egr-1 and junB significantly altered. Surprisingly, gp130 without any functional Box3 stimulates prolonged activation of MAPK, leading to an extended period of up-regulation of egr-1 and to an extracellularly regulated kinase-mediated reduction in the IL-6-stimulated production of thiostatin. IL-6 reduces proliferation of H-35 cells through signaling by the Box3. In addition, cells expressing Box3-deficient gp130 showed distinct morphologic changes upon receptor activation. Taken together, these results indicate that Box3-derived and Box3-independent signals cooperate in the control of hepatic APP genes and that Box3 may be involved in the modulation of MAPK activity in gp130 signaling.

In liver, IL-6 is a prominent inducer of the acute-phase plasma proteins (APPs) which function to protect the host against the harmful consequences of inflammation and to restore normal homeostasis (3Hirano T.

IL-6 acts in concert with other factors such as IL-1, tumor necrosis factor, and glucocorticoids to modulate the expression of APP genes. Based on the requirement of IL-1 for maximal expression, APP genes are classified into type I and type II genes (6Baumann H. Prowse K.R. Marinkovic S. Won K.-A. Jahreis G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 557: 280-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For type I APP genes such as α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), IL-1 synergizes with IL-6 and glucocorticoids in stimulating gene expression. In contrast, maximal expression of type II APP genes depends on IL-6 and glucocorticoids, and IL-1 inhibits expression of some type II APP genes such as thiostatin (Tst) and fibrinogen (Fb). The IL-6 responsive elements (IL-6RE) of a number of APP gene promoters have been mapped (6Baumann H. Prowse K.R. Marinkovic S. Won K.-A. Jahreis G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Upon ligand binding, two of each receptor subunit form a hexameric complex with two IL-6 molecules and initiate downstream signaling events (23Paonessa G. Graziani R. de Serio A. Savino R.

Comparison of the cytoplasmic regions between gp130 and other IL-6-type cytokine receptors including the receptors for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) reveals three conserved sequence motifs, namely Box1, Box2, and Box3 (26Baumann H.

The Box3 motif, with a consensus amino acid sequence of YXXQ, occurs in multiple copies in gp130, LIF receptor, and OSM receptor and represents a binding site for STAT1 and STAT3 (30Stahl N.

The current model of IL-6 signaling suggests that STAT proteins are recruited to the receptor via a phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interaction and serve as the direct downstream targets of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases (JAKs) (20Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 32Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

Phosphorylated STATs form dimers and acquire DNA binding activity. After translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, STAT dimers bind to specific regulatory elements to transactivate gene expression. Other signaling pathways have been described to have modulatory effects on the JAK/STAT pathway. For example, it has been demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) targets a specific serine residue at position 727 on STAT3 (34Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2062-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 35Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). This serine phosphorylation has been proposed to have an enhancing effect on the transactivation potential of STAT3 (35Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Previously, we characterized the signaling capability of gp130 in hepatoma cells by the transient transfection approach, and we showed that gp130 cytoplasmic domain engages at least two pathways that differ in their requirement for the Box3 motif of gp130 (36Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14847-14850Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 37Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Horseman N.D. Campos S.P. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23254-23257Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this experimental system, the Box3-dependent pathway appears to involve STAT3 in the regulation of some APP gene promoters when presented as part of episomal constructs (38Wang Y. Morella K.K. Ripperger J. Lai C.-F. Gearing D.P. Fey G.H. Campos S.P. Baumann Y. Blood. 1995; 86: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a direct assessment of the precise role for Box3 and STAT3 in the control of endogenous APP genes has not yet been possible. Unfortunately, a STAT3 knock-out mouse is not available to address this question as STAT3-deficient embryos die during early stage of development (39Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Box3-independent pathway signals to an artificial element, the hematopoietin receptor response element (HRRE), which corresponds to the core IL-6RE of the rat α2-macroglobulin gene (α2-MG) and to the “distal regulatory element” in the α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) gene promoter (40Baumann H. Gearing D. Ziegler S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromosomal genes regulated by this proposed pathway have not yet been identified. Here we assessed the importance of the Box3 motif in controlling endogenous APP genes by generating stable hepatoma cell lines expressing chimeric G-CSFR-gp130 receptor. We also attempted to elucidate the components of the Box3-independent signaling pathway in these cells. Our results indicate that both Box3-dependent and Box3-independent pathways contribute to the regulation of APP genes. The data also suggest a functional role of Box3 in modulating the duration of MAPK activity. The chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of human G-CSF receptor and the transmembrane and the first 133 amino acids of the intracellular domain of gp130 (designated as G-gp130(133)WT), as well as the corresponding construct with a tyrosine mutation in the Box3 sequence (designated as G-gp130(133)M3), have been described previously (36Lai C.-F.

The chimeric receptor construct containing the full-length 277 residue, wild-type gp130 cytoplasmic domain with C-terminal FLAG epitope, has been described (41Kim H. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The equivalent FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was also introduced at the end of G-gp130(133)WT, yielding G-gp130(133)WT-FLAG. Parental rat hepatoma H-35 cells (clone T-7-18; Ref. 6Baumann H. Prowse K.R.

To generate stable receptor-expressing cells, the chimeric receptors G-gp130(133)WT, G-gp130(133)WT-FLAG, and G-gp130(133)M3 were cloned into the retroviral vector, MINV (42Hawley R.G. Leiu F.H. Fong A.Z. Goldman S.J. Leonard J.P. Hawley T.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 795: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MINV contains an internal ribosome entry site upstream of the neomycin-resistant gene, permitting co-expression of the chimeric receptors and the neo gene product driven by the viral long terminal repeat. Replication-deficient recombinant viruses with amphotropic host range were produced from stably transduced PA317 packaging cells generated by infection with virus harvested from transiently transfected GP+E-86 ecotropic packaging cells. Virus-containing supernatant was collected from confluent cultures 24 h after medium change, filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane, and added to H-35 cell cultures. Viral infection was repeated twice more on the same cell population after 3 and 6 days. Cells with stably integrated proviruses were selected in medium containing 2 mg/ml G418 for 4 weeks. G418-resistant cells expressing the chimeric receptors without FLAG-tag were subjected to limiting dilution to establish clonal cell lines. H-35 cells transduced with G-gp130(277)-FLAG has been reported (41Kim H. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Non-cloned pools of cells expressing the FLAG-tagged receptors were used for a few comparative analyses (Fig. 4, Band C). Cells were treated with 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), 100 ng/ml IL-6 (Genetics Institute) and G-CSF, and 10 ng/ml IL-1β (Immunex Corp.), alone or in combinations in serum-free medium. Optimal inhibition of ERK activation was achieved by treatment with 25 μm PD98059 (Calbiochem). Human G-CSF was radiolabeled with125I using nonporous polystyrene beads immobilized with chloramine T (Pierce) to a specific activity of 81,000 cpm/ng. Monolayer cells (∼1.5 × 106) cultured on 6-well plates were incubated with 50 pm125I-G-CSF in binding medium (0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 4 h at 4 °C. Specific binding was determined by competition with 100 nm unlabeled G-CSF during incubation. Cells were then washed twice with binding medium and lysed in 1m NaOH, 0.1% SDS. The radioactivity in cell lysates was measured by a gamma counter (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). Bound radioactivity inhibited by excess unlabeled G-CSF was calculated in counts/min and represents the value for specific G-CSF binding. Experiments were done in triplicate. Total protein extracts were prepared from treated cells and used for EMSA as published previously (43Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Jurlander J. Hawley T.S. Carson W.E. Kordula T. Caligiuri M.A. Hawley R.G. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13968-13975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protein samples were preincubated in binding buffer for 15 min on ice. The double-stranded and end-labeled oligonucleotide representing the sequence of SIEm67 (44Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) was added to the reaction. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Total RNA was prepared by Trizol according to manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Equal amounts of RNA samples (5 or 10 μg) were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and then transferred to Nytran-plus membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The cDNAs encoding APP genes (Tst, αFb, hemopexin, haptoglobin, α2-MG, and AGP) or the early response genes (junB and egr-1) were labeled by random-prime method with a commercial kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was carried out in buffer containing 4× SSC, 0.1m sodium phosphate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.2% SDS, 200 μg/ml sheared/denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C for overnight. Membranes were then washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. Ethidium bromide-stained pattern of 28 S rRNA band served as marker for RNA loading. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer. Lysates were incubated with specific antibodies to JAK1, JAK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), TYK2, SHP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or FLAG (M2 antibody, Eastman Kodak Co.) for 16 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with protein G-conjugated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Protran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Depending upon the experimental setup, the membrane was first incubated with a mixture of the anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies, 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and PY20 (Transduction Laboratories), then stripped and reprobed for individual JAK members, SHP-2 or FLAG, to verify equal loading. Results were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL) according to manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For detection of active MAPK, equal amounts of total lysates were applied on 10% SDS gels, and transferred proteins reacted with an antibody that recognizes phosphothreonine 202 and phosphotyrosine 204 on ERK1/2 (New England Biolab). The level of ERK proteins was subsequently visualized by reaction with anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (New England Biolab). α2-MG and Tst secreted into the medium were quantitated by immunoelectrophoresis (45Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B. Silvennoinen O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 222-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) or determined by Western blotting using reaction with combined goat antibodies against rat Tst and α2-MG (Roswell Park Cancer Institute). Subconfluent H-35 cells were plated into a 96-well plate. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were treated with cytokines for 24 h in serum-free medium followed by addition of 0.4 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 16 h. Cells were harvested, and the incorporated radioactivity was quantitated by a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac). In parallel, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% serum for 2 days and then changed to medium with 5% serum with or without G-CSF for 4 days. The cell numbers were determined by counting viable cells with a hemocytometer after trypan blue staining. Cell culture morphology was determined by growing cells to confluent monolayers that were then treated with cytokines with or without dexamethasone for 24 h. The morphologic changes were observed under a phase-contrast microscope (Nikon). Previously, by constructing G-CSFR-gp130 chimeric receptors, we have reconstituted signaling events in transiently transfected hepatoma cells, which were similar to those initiated by endogenous gp130 (26Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of gp130 indicated that the membrane-proximal 133 amino acids of gp130 were sufficient to induce transcription of co-transfected chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter-gene constructs through the IL-6RE and some APP gene promoters (26Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14847-14850Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Within this region, a single tyrosine residue (Tyr-126) in a Box3 sequence (YXXQ) was found to be critical for the regulation. Since the transient transfection approach has its technical limitation in reproducing physiologically normal conditions, we assessed the signaling specificity conferred by the Box3 motif on the regulation of endogenous APP genes in hepatic cells, by generating lines of rat hepatoma H-35 cells stably expressing the chimeric receptor, G-gp130(133)WT, and its Box3 mutant counterpart, G-gp130(133)M3, using the retroviral vector MINV. From several clonal lines of transduced H-35 cells obtained, one representative line of each receptor type was selected. Northern blot analysis indicated equal levels of expression of the messenger RNAs encoding the expected bicistronic receptor-neo gene transcripts (Fig. 1 A). The two G-gp130 lines also expressed comparable G-CSF binding activity on the cell surface as shown by the 125I-G-CSF binding assay (Fig.1 B). The number of binding sites in each case was estimated to be about 1,500 sites per cell. With the latter development of H-35 cell lines transduced with FLAG-tagged receptors, we could also visualize the level of receptor proteins by Western blotting (Fig.4 B, bottom). Signaling by hematopoietin receptors is initiated by members of the JAK family (19Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar,46Baumann H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 566-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses showed that JAK1 was induced to a comparable level by G-CSF in cells expressing either the wild-type or the M3 mutant G-gp130 receptor (Fig.2, upper panel). TYK2 (Fig. 2,lower panel) and JAK2 (data not shown) were likewise stimulated by G-CSF to a similar extent despite a relatively higher basal level in untreated cells. Importantly, the activation of JAKs by G-CSF was similar to that induced by IL-6. Next, we examined the effects of the Box3 mutation on the activation of STAT proteins which are recognized downstream targets of JAKs. Expression of the chimeric receptors did not noticeably alter the magnitude or the kinetics of STAT activation induced by IL-6 (Fig.3, upper panel). A strong activation of SIE-binding activities that resolved into three bands was observed 15 min after IL-6 treatment. As shown previously, these bands represented STAT3 homodimer (top band), STAT3/STAT1 heterodimer (middle band), and STAT1 homodimer (bottom band), respectively (47Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Only the STAT homodimer was maintained during longer treatment. Upon exposure to G-CSF, G-gp130(133)WT mediated a characteristic pattern of STAT activation similar to IL-6, albeit lower in magnitude, probably reflecting the effect of deleting three of the four Box3 motifs (Fig. 3, lower panel). In contrast, the Box3 mutant receptor failed to stimulate any significant amount of detectable SIE binding activity. These results indicate that although Box3 is not required for JAK activation, it is indispensable for the activation of STATs. STAT3 was originally purified as a protein binding to the IL-6RE of the α2-MG gene promoter (also called the acute-phase response factor (APRF)). By transient transfection, we demonstrated that STAT3 is able to transactivate certain APP gene promoters. It has also been shown that Box3 acts as a receptor-binding site for STAT3, thus implicating an essential role for Box3 in the control of APP genes. To test this functional link, we examined the effects of the Box3 mutation on the expression of the endogenous APP genes in the stable G-gp130 cell lines. Northern blot analysis of four representative APP genes, including Tst, αFb, hemopexin, and haptoglobin, showed an up-regulation of RNA levels in response to G-CSF in cells expressing G-gp130(133)WT (Fig.4 A). The M3 mutant cells were unresponsive to similar treatment, and no induction of these APPs was detected. The IL-6 response of the two different cell lines was, however, comparable. The lower APP stimulation by G-gp130(133)WT than by endogenous IL-6R was attributed to the reduced activation of STAT3 by the chimeric receptor. To confirm in the G-CSFR-gp130 context the relevance of fourversus one Box3 elements in determining quantitative level APP induction, we compared APP response in pool cultures of H-35 cells transduced with G-g130(277) or G-gp130(133), both tagged at the C terminus with FLAG epitope. In separate experiments (not presented), we have established that the FLAG epitope has no appreciable influence on signaling gp130 cytoplasmic domains. The FLAG epitope allowed immunodetection of both receptor proteins and their ligand-induced phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B). FLAG antibody reaction with G-gp130(133) yielded an approximately 2-fold higher signal than with G-gp130(277). However, the signal with antiphosphotyrosine antibody was severalfold lower with G-gp130(133), which is in agreement with the reduced number of phosphorylation sites. Treatment of these cells for 24 h with G-CSF resulted in a stimulated production of thiostatin in G-gp130(277) cells that was similar to IL-6 treatment (Fig.4 C, samples 1 and 2). In contrast, G-gp130(133)WT cells responded to G-CSF by a production of Tst that was only 15% that to IL-6 (samples 4 and 5). An equivalently low Tst induction by G-CSF was noted in cells expressing G-gp130(133) without FLAG epitope (Fig. 4 A and Fig.5 B). Cells treated with the combination of G-CSF and IL-6 indicated an enhanced response (Fig.5 B, samples 3 and 6) that, in the case of G-gp130(133)WT, amounted to an additive action. A stimulatory action of G-gp130(133)M3 on the expression of the four APPs in Fig. 4 A was not detectable, and an inhibitory effect, if any, was not identifiable due to the low to non-detectable basal expression of these APPs. In testing the response of G-gp130(133)M3 cells (Fig. 4 C) (or recently established H-35 cells expressing G-gp130(133)M3-FLAG (data not shown)) with the combination of IL-6 and G-CSF, the stimulatory action of IL-6 was reduced rather than enhanced (Fig. 4 C, sample 9). This suggests that the signaling retained by G-gp130(133)M3 was opposing, in part, the si"

Mutations of these sites in the cry1A gene resulted in decreased binding of the E2 protein and altered kinetics of expression of a fusion of this regulatory region with the lacZ gene. Recruitment of the E2 subunit as a transcription factor could couple the change in post exponential catabolism to the initiation of protoxin synthesis.

There is extensive synthesis of the related protoxins which are often packaged into the same inclusion. Each of these protoxins has a somewhat different specificity (7Hofte H. Whiteley H.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 242-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and there may be synergism among some (8Tabashnik B.E. Appl. Environ.

Many but not all of these genes contain very similar overlapping promoters (2Baum J.A. Malvar T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3Agaisse H. Lereclus D. J.

Dual promoters ensure transcription of these particular genes (cry1) throughout much of sporulation 1M. Sedlak, T. Walter, and A. Aronson, manuscipt in preparation. (5Brizzard B.L. Schnepf H.E. Kronstad J.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but they are differentially transcribed (6Aronson A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 4057-4060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control of expression of thecry genes is necessary not only to ensure a balance of transcription with mother-cell spore genes which utilize the same forms of RNA polymerase but for regulating the relative amounts of the various protoxins and their assembly into an inclusion (2Baum J.A. Malvar T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Given the similarity of the overlapping promoter regions for three of these cry1 genes, the sequences upstream for ∼1 kbp2 were examined and found to differ substantially (10Smith G.P. Ellar D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 16: 6240Google Scholar). 3M. Geiser, personal communication., 4A. Aronson, unpublished results.These regions appear to be important for regulation because expression of cry1-lacZ fusion plasmids in B. thuringiensiswas enhanced by their presence.1 Employing a gel retardation assay, a novel DNA binding protein was identified and purified, and its gene was cloned. The binding sites in the upstream regions of two of these cry genes were determined by footprinting. The effects of mutations in these sites indicated that this protein is likely to have a role in regulating the expression of this class of protoxin genes. B. thuringiensis subsp.kurstaki HD1, strain 80-21 (11Aronson A.I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 117: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), subsp. aizawaiHD133, and a plasmid-cured (with mitomycin C) acrystalliferous derivative of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstakiHD1 designated Mit94 were grown in G-Tris medium at 30 °C (12Aronson A.I. Angelo W. Holt S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 106: 1016-1025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a New Brunswick incubator shaker. This medium contains 0.2% glucose as the principal carbon source, which was replaced with 0.1% potassium gluconate for the β-galactosidase assays (see below).Bacillus subtilis JH642 was grown in nutrient sporulation medium at 37 °C. Growth was monitored by A 600in a Perkin Elmer Model 35 spectrophotometer and sporulation in the phase microscope. A region of 280 bp upstream of the cryIAb gene was prepared by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-AATAGGATCCTTCCTATATTTACTTTGCCC-3′, containing a BamHI site, and 5′-GGTTTGAATTCCGTTAACTTATTTTAAAGT-3′, containing an EcoRI site. The region upstream of the promoters of the cry1C gene was isolated as a 656-bp BglII/HindIII fragment from a 7-kbp EcoRI fragment containing this gene, including 2.5 kbp upstream of the promoters (13Sanchis V. Lereclus D. Menou G. Chaufaux J. Guo S. Lecadet M.-M. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This fragment was isolated from low melting agarose with GELase (Epicentre Technologies) and cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pUC18. For gel retardation, this clone was digested with EcoRI andHindIII, and the 656-bp fragment was reisolated as described above. The cryID gene (14Hofte H. Soetaert P. Jansens S. Peferoen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was cloned as a 3.8 kbp KpnI fragment from B. thuringiensis subsp. aizawaiHD133, strain 5 (11Aronson A.I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 117: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), into the Escherichia coli/B. thuringiensis shuttle vector pHT3101 (15Lereclus D. Arantes O. Chaufaux J. Lecadet M.-M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 60: 211-218Google Scholar). A 2.2-kbpNdeI fragment embracing most of the coding region was deleted from this plasmid, creating pΔID from which thecryID upstream region including the promoters was isolated as a 1.6-kbp KpnI1-NdeI fragment. The E2 binding site containing a potential bend region was mutated from 5′-CTCAATTTGTATATGTAAAATAGGAAAAGTG to 5′-CTCAGTCTGTCTATGTAGAACAGGACAAGTG (bold letters indicate changes including the creation of anMspHI site for screening) employing oligonucleotide 5′-CACTTCTCCTGTTGTACATAGACAGACTGAG. The inverted repeat (IR; see Fig.4) was mutated from 5′-CCTGCAATTCATCTTGAATTGTAAATGC to 5′-CCTGCAGTTAAGCCTGAATTGTAAATGC with the introduction of a PstI site for screening. The cry1Ab upstream region as a 310-bp HindIII fragment (see Fig. 4) was cloned into pGEM 11(+) for production of single-stranded template in E. coli CJ236 (dut −, ung−). Mutagenesis followed the procedure of Kunkel (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and plasmids produced in E. coli DH5α were screened initially for the presence of an additional MspHI or PstI site in the insert and then sequenced to confirm the changes. The mutagenizedHindIII fragment was isolated from the pGEM clone as described above, and the fragment inserted into the singleHindIII site in a lacZ fusion vector containing the cry1A promoter region (see below). The orientation was established on the basis of the sizes of HpaI restriction fragments. Strain Mit9 was grown in 2 liters of G-Tris medium until about 70% of the cells contained phase bright endospores. B. subtilis JH642 was grown in 500 ml of nutrient sporulation medium until >50% contained phase bright endospores (the maximum is about 70% versus >90% for Mit9). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with 20 ml of 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The pellets were suspended in 1/5 volume of buffer A (50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), washed twice with this buffer, resuspended in 1/50 the original volume of buffer A plus 1 mm dithiothreitol, and lysed in a French press at 9000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 4500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was withdrawn and centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. This supernatant was then heated to 45 °C for 10 min to inactivate DNases while leaving binding activity unaltered. The heated extract was fractionated by the addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 to final concentrations of 25, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100% of saturation. The protein precipitate after each step was collected by centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, dissolved in 0.5 × TBE (0.04m Tris, 0.04 m sodium borate, 2 mmEDTA, pH 8.0), and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against two changes of 2 liters each of this buffer. Each fraction was then tested for binding activity as described below. The active 50–60% (NH4)2SO4fraction from Mit9 was further fractionated by passage over a heparin-agarose column (17Wampler S.L. Tyree C.M. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21223-21231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One column volume was loaded in 0.5 × TBE at 4 °C, and the effluent was passed back over the column ten times. After washing with 4 column volumes of 0.5 × TBE, the column was eluted with a KCl gradient from 0 to 0.4 m in 0.5 × TBE. One-ml fractions were collected, concentrated 4-fold by lyophilization, and dialyzed against 0.5 × TBE. Fractions were assayed for binding activity as described below. Purification was also performed by excising and eluting the retarded DNA band from polyacrylamide gels. Elution was performed in a Little Blue Tank elutrap system (ISCO) using 0.05 × TBE in the sample wells and 0.5 × TBE in the electrophoresis chamber. The DNA-protein complex concentrated in this way was dissociated by addition of KCl to 0.4 m for 8 h at 27 °C. The DNA was then digested for 1 h at 37 °C with 20 units of DNase I, and the protein was fractionated in 10% SDS-PAGE (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and stained (18Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein bands were excised, and the sequence of the first 25 amino acids was determined in an automated sequenator (Purdue Center for Macromolecular Structure). DNA was treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP; 2 units per mg of DNA) at 37 °C for 45 min, extracted with phenol and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was then dissolved in 10 mm Tris, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, and incubated with l0 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 300 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (150 mCi ml−1) per μg of DNA for 90 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 25 μl. To remove the label from one end, the 32P-DNA was digested withBamHI for footprinting the transcribed strand and withEcoRI for the nontranscribed strand. The labeled DNA was purified by excision from a low-melting agarose gel and digestion with GELase. Retardation assays (19Lane D. Prentki P. Chandler M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 509-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed in 3.5% native polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 60:1) as per Fried and Crothers (20Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) and Garner and Revzin (21Garner M.M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). After investigating several buffers, it was found that the best retardation was observed when protein and 32P-labeled DNA were mixed in 20 μl of 0.5 × TBE and incubated at 16 °C for 20 min. Five μl of bromphenol blue-xylene cyanol in 5 msucrose was added to the samples, which were loaded onto vertical gels prepared in 0.5 × TBE and subjected to electrophoresis at 4 °C and 10 V/cm until the bromphenol blue dye front was about 3/4 of the way down the gel (approximately 2.5 h for a 15-cm gel). The gel was dried at 80 °C under vacuum and autoradiographed. ThepdhC gene encoding the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) from B. thuringiensis was cloned as a fusion with the glutathione S-transferase gene in the pGEX-KG expression vector (22Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). PCR oligonucleotides: 5′-TAGGAGGTCGGGATCCGTGGCATTTGAATT-3′ containing aBamHI site and 5′-ATAGGGAAATCTCGAGCTACCATAACATTA-3′ containing a XhoI site were based on the sequences of the B. subtilis pdhC gene (23Hemila H. Palva A. Paulin L. Arvidson S. Palva I. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5052-5063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used to clone a 1350-bp region of DNA from B. thuringiensis corresponding to itspdhC gene. This gene was cloned in-frame as aBamHIXhoI fragment into the pGEX-KG vector to produce plasmid pCB117. It was sequenced and had a deduced open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of the expected size. A fusion protein consisting of B. thuringiensis PDH-E2 fused to glutathione S-transferase was produced after transformation of pCB117 into E. coli TG1 and induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (22Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The fusion protein that was purified by elution from a glutathione-agarose column (24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) reacted with anti-PDH-E2 antibody from Staphylococcus aureus, kindly provided by Dr. H. Hemila (23Hemila H. Palva A. Paulin L. Arvidson S. Palva I. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5052-5063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glutathioneS-transferase could not be removed by thrombin digestion without disrupting the B. thuringiensis PDH-E2 protein, which contains an internal thrombin cleavage site. To obtain a less extensive E2 fusion protein, this gene was also cloned into the His6 expression vector, pQE30 (Qiagen). TheBamHI/XhoI fragment was cloned into pUC18 and then excised as a BamHI/SphI fragment for cloning in-phase in pQE30. E. coli DH5α containing this clone was grown in LB-ampicillin (25 μg ml−1) and expression was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were lysed as per the Qiagen manual. Although there was substantial His6-E2 in the soluble fraction, the E2 protein solubilized from the pellet with 6 m urea in 0.05m Na2HPO4, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 8.0 was most active in gel retardation. The latter was fractionated on a Ni2+-agarose column using a step gradient of 0.1–0.3m imidazole in the above buffer. After dialysis for 18 h at 4 °C against 4000 volumes of 0.5 × TBE, fractions were assayed for gel retardation activity, and the most active fraction was stored at −80 °C. Fifty ng of purified, end-labeled DNA was incubated with varying amounts of the E2 protein and 5 μg of poly(dI·dC) in 20 μl of 0.5 × TBE. The binding reaction was carried out for 20 min at 16 °C, after which 0.05 units of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) in 12.5 mm MgCl2 was added and the tubes incubated at 25 °C for 90 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 30 mm EDTA and extraction of the mixture with phenol-chloroform. The DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol and dissolved in Sequenase stop buffer (United States Biochemical). After heating at 90 °C for 5 min, samples were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gradient gel containing 8 m urea in 90 mm Tris, 89 mm borate, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3 (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and electrophoresed at 1000 V and 75 mA. Gels were then dried and autoradiographed. DNA sequence was obtained according to the standard method for double-stranded DNA sequence analysis (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with the addition of Mn2+ to the reaction mix to allow sequence determination near the primer (25Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A cryIAbpromoter-lacZ fusion was constructed in an E. coli/Bacillus shuttle vector.1 AHindIII-digested, PCR-cloned 310-bp upstream fragment from the cryIAb gene (containing the region from −218 to −528; see Fig. 5) was inserted in both orientations into a singleHindIII site upstream of the protoxin promoters. This fragment containing the mutated bend or IR regions was also inserted into this vector, and the plasmids were electroporated (26Schurter W. Geiser M. Mathe D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) into strain 80–21. Cells were grown in G-Tris medium (12Aronson A.I. Angelo W. Holt S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 106: 1016-1025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.l% yeast extract and 0.1% potassium gluconate plus 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Differences in induction of β-galactosidase (but not growth) were more evident when potassium gluconate rather than glucose was the primary carbon source. Samples of 0.2 ml were taken at various times during growth and sporulation, sonicated for 10 s, and 30–50 μl were assayed for β-galactosidase activity (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) as modified by Giacomini et al. (28Giacomini A. Corich V. Ollero F.J. Squarlini H. Nucli M.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 100: 87-90PubMed Google Scholar). Growth was monitored byA 600 in the Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer and sporulation followed in the phase microscope, measuring the percent phase dull, phase white, and phase bright endospores in each sample. The 50–60% (NH4)2SO4 fraction of a crude extract from sporulating but not from growing cells of B. thuringiensis strain Mit9 retarded a 280-bp fragment from thecry1A upstream region, a 656-bp fragment fromcry1C, and an ∼1.6-kbp fragment from cry1D(Fig. 1). In all cases, at least a 1,000-fold excess of poly(dI·dC) was present. The further addition of a small excess of homologous unlabeled DNA competed for binding, whereas the same concentration of pUC18 did not (Fig.2 A). Even a 100-fold excess of pUC18 DNA (either linear or as 0.3 + 2.4-kbp PvuII fragments) or sonicated B. subtilis DNA did not compete.4 There was some inhibition of retardation by a 50-fold excess of sonicated calf thymus DNA (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Gel retardation assays of the competition by homologous and heterologous DNAs (A andB) or by different sources of the binding protein (C).

There was greater retardation of thecry1A fragment by equivalent amounts of E2 in the 50–60% ammonium sulfate fraction from B. thuringiensis Mit9 than that from B. subtilis JH642 (Fig. 2 C). A comparable preparation from E. coli did not retard. Retardation of 1 pmol of the cry1Ab fragment was complete when incubated with about 2 μg of the 50–60% ammonium sulfate fraction from B. thuringiensis. Complete retardation of thecry1C and cry1D DNAs required 10–20-fold more protein, indicating lower affinities and/or more binding sites. There were several degrees of retardation of these DNAs (arrows on the right panel of Fig. 1) in contrast to thecry1A DNA. The presence of multiple retarded complexes may be because of several binding sites with different affinities for the protein. The binding protein was isolated by electroelution of an excised, retarded band followed by dialysis and digestion with DNase I. This procedure resulted in recovery of a single protein of ∼60 kDa (Fig.3). The sequence of the first 25 residues of this band was 92% identical to that of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, the E2 subunit of PDH from B. subtilisand Bacillus stearothermophilus (TableI). The E2 subunit is a 48-kDa protein containing lipoic acid (which decreases its mobility in SDS-PAGE).Table IComparisons of the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal 25 residues of PDH E2 proteins from several Gram (+) bacteria with that from Bacillus thuringiensisBacterial speciesSequence of E2 proteinaSources are given in Refs. 24 and 40.

Open table in a new tab Because sufficient quantities of E2 could not be renatured after elution from the retarded complex, the 50–60% (NH4)2SO4 fraction was further purified by elution from a heparin-agarose column with a KCl gradient. The greatest binding activity (based on retardation ofcry1A DNA) was in the 0.2–0.3 m KCl fraction that contained the E2 protein as >50% of the total based on staining and confirmed by immunoblotting with antiserum against the B. subtilis PDH complex. The E1α and E1β subunits of PDH eluted at a lower salt concentration, and this fraction retarded poorly (41.Walter, T., Regulation of cry Gene Transcription in Bacillus thuringiensis by a DNA Binding Protein which Recognizes DNA Elements Upstream of the cry IAb, cry IC, and cry ID Genes.Ph.D. thesis, 1995, Purdue University.Google Scholar). The purified glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein protected three regions in the 280-bp cry1Ab DNA (Fig. 4,A and B and Fig.5). The most distal of these and the inverted repeat share a common sequence. The third region was within a stretch of intrinsically bent DNA (29Eckdahl T.T. Anderson J.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8531-8545Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with a 10-bp spacing between each of the protected regions. There were also several hypersensitive sites on both strands (arrows). A major protected site in the cry1C DNA was within an inverted repeat (Fig.6) almost identical in sequence to that in the cry1Ab DNA. There were also a multiplicity of hypersensitive sites in this DNA but no detectable bend region. The footprint with the heparin-agarose fraction was the same as that obtained with the purified fusion protein. The binding site within the bend region and the IR were mutated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both were found to have lower affinities for purified His6-E2 protein than the wild type fragment (Fig.7). The apparent K dvalue for the wild type, assuming that it was the monomer of the His6-E2 adduct that bound, was 4–6 nm. E2 is a multimer in the PDH complex (30Wallis N.G. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), however, and it is likely that a multimeric form of this protein is required for binding to DNA. As mentioned above, only His6-E2 extracted from the crude membrane fraction with 4–6 m urea in buffer was active. The extent of gel retardation by His6-E2 purified from theE. coli clone was greater than that of E2 purified fromB. thuringiensis (Figs. 1 and 7), implying different aggregation states perhaps because of concentration effects or the presence or absence of lipoamide. Cells containing lacZ fusions with either thecry1A wild type or mutant (bend and IR) upstream regions were sampled during sporulation, and the kinetics of β-galactosidase synthesis was determined (Fig. 8). Addition of the upstream DNA resulted in an enhancement of β-galactosidase synthesis. Both the initial rate and the final activity were reduced in strains containing the mutated upstream regions. Regulation of protoxin genes is of interest not only because of their insecticidal properties but from the perspective of how a cell recruits regulatory elements for a group of structural genes that have very likely become part of the genetic repertoire of thisBacillus relatively late in evolution. One aspect of the regulation is the presence of dual overlapping promoters, which ensures a constant rate of transcription of these cry genes during an extended period of sporulation. In addition, each of these genes is independently regulated, so factors other than the promoters must be involved. The sequences upstream of the promoters for the differentially regulated cry1A, cry1C, and cry1Dgenes differ substantially (although some features are shared; see below) so we began a search for DNA binding proteins. Extracts of sporulating but not vegetative cells of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki contained a protein that bound to regions of DNA upstream of the cry1Ab,cry1C, and cry1D gene promoters. The major binding protein in the heparin-purified fraction from B. thuringiensis was identified as the E2 subunit of PDH. The purified GST-E2 or His6-E2 fusion proteins footprinted to specific sites in the cry1A and cry1C upstream regions. The presence of three close binding sites in thecry1A but not the cry1C sequence may account for the higher affinity for the E2 oligomer by the former (Fig. 1) and thus a basis for the differential regulation of these cry 1genes. The evidence for specific binding of this novel DNA binding protein is 1) the presence of a consensus binding sequence (5′-cAAGAT/gG/tAA) in two of the three sites in the cry1A sequence and within the inverted repeat in the cry1C sequence. There was also binding to an intrinsically bent region in the cry1A DNA. The binding site(s) in the cry1D DNA have not been mapped. 2) There was optimal competitive binding by the homologous DNA and very little or no competition by nonspecific DNAs such as poly(dI·dC), pUC18, or B. subtilis DNAs. Sonicated calf thymus did compete at higher concentrations (Fig. 2 B), probably because of the complexity of sequences in this DNA including potential bend regions. 3) There was no binding to a digest of pUC18, which included a fragment similar in size (about 0.3 kbp) to that of thecry1A upstream fragment. 4) There was higher affinity binding by the E2 protein from B. thuringiensis as compared with that from B. subtilis. While the deduced sequences of the B. thuringiensis and B. subtilis E2 proteins are >80% identical, there is considerably less homology in and around the so-called hinge region.4 This region of E2 links the lipoyl domain to the E1 and E3 binding sites (30Wallis N.G. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and it is a potential DNA binding region (37Kalia Y.N. Brocklehurst S.M. Hipps D.S. Appella E. Sakaguchi K. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 323-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry and patterns of DNA retardation indicated extensive cooperativity in the binding, probably involving conformational changes to allow some form of the E2 protein to bind. The icosohedral core of PDH is comprised of 60 E2 subunits (30Wallis N.G. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), so it is likely that some multimeric form is involved in binding as indicated by the requirement of a urea extraction in the purification protocol of His6-E2 from E. coli. The role of lipoamide, which is a component of E2 in the PDH complex, is not known. Whatever conformational changes of the DNA occurred could be reversed by treatment with protease K, demonstrating that the continued presence of E2 was essential. In many respects, the binding was similar to that of the Lrp protein (31Calvo J.M. Matthews R.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 466-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may serve as a useful paradigm. The importance of these E2 binding sites was indicated by the effect of mutations on the binding of His6-E2 and on the expression of lacZ fusions (Figs. 7 and 8). Both the rates and final amounts were reduced, but the former may be particularly important. These parasporal inclusions have a crystalline array (32Bulla Jr., L.A. Bechtel D.B. Kramer K.J. Shethna Y.I. Aronson A.I. Fitz-James P.C. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1980; 8: 147-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) so that the deposition of the disulfide cross-linked protoxins (33Bietlot H.P.L. Vishmulhatla J. Carey P.R. Pozsgay M. Kaplan H. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) must be an orderly process, very likely dependent upon chaperones and other factors (2Baum J.A. Malvar T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A decrease in the rate of protoxin accumulation such as that resulting from mutations in the upstream binding sites for the E2 protein (Fig. 8) could substantially alter the relative amount of the Cry1A protoxin in the inclusion. The consensus binding sequence is also present close to the start site of transcription of the pdhC gene in B. subtilis(23Hemila H. Palva A. Paulin L. Arvidson S. Palva I. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5052-5063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as near the origin of replication (34Laffan J.J. Firshein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7452-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 35Eident-Wilkinson B. Mele L. Laffan J. Firshein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 477-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter was identified as a region of the chromosomal DNA bound to the membrane primarily by a protein of 60 kDa, which was subsequently identified as E2. 5W. Firshein, personal communication. The E2 protein inNeurospora crassa (designated MRP3) appears to be a mitochondrial ribosomal protein (36Russell G.C. Guest J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1076: 224-232Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) so its recruitment for other functions is not without precedence. A role for the E2 subunit in regulation implies a connection between catabolism and protoxin synthesis. It has been known for some time that the protoxin yield per spore or per mg of dry weight varies considerably with the subspecies studied and with the media (38Dulmage H.T. J. Invert. Pathol. 1970; 16: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). During growth on glucose, bacilli excrete acetic acid, pyruvic acid, and acetoin (39Nakata H.M. Halvorson H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1960; 80: 801-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which are catabolized during sporulation (40Hederstedt L. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram Positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 181-197Google Scholar). The pyruvate is utilized rapidly, and PDH is then no longer required for catabolism. At about this time, the E2 subunit is found in the soluble fraction of sporulating cells4 (35Eident-Wilkinson B. Mele L. Laffan J. Firshein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 477-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The source of the soluble E2 could be dissociation of the PDH complex and/or transcription from its own promoter (23Hemila H. Palva A. Paulin L. Arvidson S. Palva I. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5052-5063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which does function at the end of growth.4 The E2 consensus binding sequence in this promoter region is thus all the more intriguing. The presence of soluble E2 would signal the end of growth on sugars, and its recruitment for regulating the plasmid-encoded crygenes would provide a mechanism for selectively enhancing their transcription in postexponential cells. The amount of soluble E2 in sporulating cells would depend upon prior growth conditions and perhaps autoinduction of the pdhC gene. Such factors could integrate cell growth with the subsequent transcription of the crygenes. We thank Dr. H. Hemila for providing antibodies to the PDH complex and to the E2 protein as well as a clone of the B. subtilis pdhC gene. Dr. Lan Wu provided considerable technical assistance."

This system was first discovered in the muscarinic deceleration of the heartbeat (1Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C821-C830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it is considered to play an essential role in the hormone-mediated inhibitory regulation of neural excitability (1Kurachi Y. Am. J.

Electrophysiological studies have revealed that a variety of inhibitory receptors, including M2-muscarinic, A1-purinergic, D2-dopamine, α2-adrenergic, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid type B, opioid, and somatostatin receptors in the brain, are coupled to KG channels (3North R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 13-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In endocrine organs such as the anterior pituitary lobe and pancreatic islet, it was also reported that some neurotransmitters including dopamine and somatostatin hyperpolarize the membrane by activating KG channels, which results in the inhibition of hormone secretion (4Einhorn L.C.

In the brain and heart, Kir3.1 forms functional KG channels by assembling with other Kir3.0 subunits such as GIRK2/Kir3.2, GIRK3/Kir3.3 (10Karschin C. Dissmann E. Stuhmer W. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3559-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ponce A. Bueno E. Kentros C. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Chow A. Hillman D. Chen S. Zhu L. Wu M.B. Wu X. Rudy B. Thornhill W.B. J.

The anterior pituitary lobe contains several kinds of endocrine cells: lactotrophs, somatotrophs, corticotrophs, and thyrotrophs. Although electrophysiological experiments have shown that somatostatin or dopamine activate KG currents in lactotrophs (4Einhorn L.C. Oxford G.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 462: 563-578Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and also in several cell lines derived from the anterior pituitary lobe, such as GH3 (5Yatani A. Codina J. Sekura R.D. Birnbaumer L. Brown A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and AtT20 (6Pennefather P.S. Heisler S. McDonald J.F. Brain Res. 1988; 444: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the cellular and subcellular localizations of KG channels in in vivo pituitary endocrine cells have not been examined. In this study, using a polyclonal antibody specific to Kir3.1, we found that this subunit was expressed only in thyrotroph cells and, surprisingly, was localized predominantly on intracellular secretory vesicles. Kir3.4 was co-localized on the vesicles with Kir3.1. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation of thyrotrophs caused fusion of the vesicles to the cell membrane, increase of cell capacitance, and enhancement of dopamine- or somatostatin-induced KG current. These data indicate a novel mechanism for the rapid insertion of functional ion channels into the plasma membrane, which could form a new type of negative feedback control loop for thyrotrophs by tuning up their inhibitory regulatory signaling system in response to the stimulatory signal. The polyclonal antibody for Kir3.1 (aG1C-1) was raised in rabbit against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 488–501 (LPAKLRKMNSDRFT) of Kir3.1/GIRK1 (15Morishige K. Inanobe A.

We have also developed the antibody to Kir3.4 (aG4N-10) in rabbit using the antigenic peptide, DSRNAMNQDMEIGV, which corresponds to amino acids 4–17 of Kir3.4 (17Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). These antibodies have been successfully used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses of Kir3.1 protein (15Morishige K. Inanobe A. Takahashi N. Yoshimoto Y. Kurachi H. Miyake A.

Kurachi, unpublished results. in the brain and heart. Furthermore, in the rat heart, the immunoreactivities were detected with the antibodies only in the atrium but not in the ventricle (data not shown). This finding coincides with the expression of the cardiac KG channel, which is composed of the subunits Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 in the heart atrium (13Karschin C. Schreibmayer W. Dascal N. Lester H. Davidson N. Karschin A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was performed according to a method described elsewhere (15Morishige K. Inanobe A. Takahashi N. Yoshimoto Y. Kurachi H. Miyake A. Tokunaga Y. Maeda T. Kurachi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 0.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde, and 0.2% (w/v) picric acid, 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The anterior pituitary lobe was removed, postfixed in a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid for 48 h at 4 °C, and transferred to 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 15% (w/v) sucrose and 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide at 4 °C. Sections were cut with a cryostat at 20 μm of thickness and stored at 4 °C in the same solution until used. After rinsing, the sections were placed in free-floating states into aG1C-1 that had been diluted (1:10,000) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and incubated for 3 days at 4 °C. After incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, staining was accomplished using the avidin-biotin complex method (Vectastain Elite kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), with nickel-diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. Control procedures consisted of preabsorbing aG1C-1 (1:10,000 dilution) by incubating with a saturating concentration of the antigenic peptide. For double immunofluorescent staining, sections were first incubated with aG1C-1 and a monoclonal antibody for each pituitary hormone,i.e. anti-prolactin monoclonal antibody (QED Bioscience Inc., San Diego, CA), anti-growth hormone monoclonal antibody (Quartett, Berlin, Germany), anti-luteinizing hormone monoclonal antibody (Quartett), anti-adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) monoclonal antibody (YLEM, Rome, Italy), or anti-thyrotropin (TSH) monoclonal antibody (Quartett). The sections were washed thoroughly and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (E. Y. Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) and Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Protos ImmunoResearch, San Francisco, CA). These sections were examined with a confocal microscope (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hertfordshire, U. K.). For electron microscopy, sections were processed according to the method described elsewhere (18Tadokoro C. Yoshimoto Y. Sakata M. Imai T. Yamaguchi M. Kurachi H. Oka Y. Maeda T. Miyake A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TRH stimulation involved the injection of 10 μg of TRH into the femoral vein 10 min before the perfusion, which was enough to stimulate the thyrotroph in vivo (19Martin J.B. Reichlin S. Science. 1970; 168: 1366-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The vibratome sections were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and incubated in a mixture of ethanol and LR Gold resin (London Resin, Berkshire, U. K.) followed by flat embedment in fresh LR Gold containing 0.1% (v/v) benzyl on silicon-coated glass slides. The embedded sections were polymerized for 6 h in an ultraviolet cryochamber (Pelco, Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) at −20 °C. Small blocks containing anterior pituitary lobe were cut out and glued to black resin. Ultrathin sections were cut using an ultramicrotome (Ultracut UCT, Leika, Vienna, Austria) and mounted on collodion and carbon-coated nickel grids (thin bar grid, Nishin EM Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The nickel grids with ultrathin sections were incubated with 3% (v/v) normal goat serum in 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% (w/v) saponin, and 0.05% (w/v) NH4Cl for 30 min at room temperature. The grids were then incubated with aG1C-1 (1:100) or aG4N-10 (1:50) in the same buffer for 2 h and then with a 15-nm immunogold conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (British BioCell International Inc., Cardiff, U. K., diluted 1:40) for 1.5 h at room temperature. In the case of double immunolabeling, the grids were incubated with aG1C-1 (1:100) or aG4N-10 (1:50), and anti-TSH monoclonal antibody (1:10) followed by incubation with immunogold-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (15-nm gold particles) and immunogold-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (10 nm gold particles). The grids were washed with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline and then with distilled water before staining with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate. These sections were examined with an electron microscope (H7100TE, Hitachi, Hitachinaka, Japan). Anterior pituitary glands were dissected from adult female Wistar rats. Cells were dispersed enzymatically using a non-trypsin dissociation protocol modified from that used by Einhorn and Oxford (4Einhorn L.C. Oxford G.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 462: 563-578Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, the glands were removed and minced in sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution that was free of calcium and magnesium (Hanks' CMF). After washing, the fragments were incubated in a shaking water bath for 1 h in 37 °C in Hanks' CMF containing trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, 0.1 mg/100 ml), collagenase (Worthington, 0.3%), and DNase I (Sigma, 1.0 mg/100 ml). Fragments were then mechanically dispersed by trituration with a siliconized Pasteur pipette, washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, filtered through nylon mesh (20 μm), and harvested via centrifugation. Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Whole cell recordings were made utilizing the gigaohm seal patch-clamp technique (20Ishii M. Horio Y. Tada Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7725-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recordings were made using a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-7, List Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany) and recorded on videocassette tapes with a PCM converter system (RP-880, NF Electronic Circuit Design, Yokohama, Japan), reproduced and low pass-filtered at 1 kHz (−3 db) by a filter with Bessel characteristics (48 db/octave slope attenuation) for an analysis and illustration. Experiments were performed at 22–24 °C in a bath solution composed (in mm) of the following: NaCl (91), KCl (50), MgCl2 (1Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C821-C830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), glucose (5.5), and Hepes buffer (5Yatani A. Codina J. Sekura R.D. Birnbaumer L. Brown A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), pH 7.2. The composition of the pipette filling solution was as follows (in mm): KCl (140), MgCl2 (8Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), EGTA (0.1), CaCl2 (0.0415), GTP (0.1), and Hepes (5Yatani A. Codina J. Sekura R.D. Birnbaumer L. Brown A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), pH 7.2. Cytoplasmic RNAs of a dissociated single pituitary cell, which was aspirated and transferred into a microcentrifuge tube with a glass tip used for patch-clamp experiments, were extracted, and cDNAs were synthesized as described elsewhere (21Sucher N.J. Deitcher D.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To eliminate the contamination of genomic DNAs, we treated RNA samples with DNase I (Takara) followed by cDNA synthesis with reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). To ascertain that cytoplasmic RNAs were correctly aspirated, samples were conducted to RT-PCR of β-actin by the β-actin PCR kit (CLONTECH). We could detect the β-actin transcripts in all of the Type I cells, 16 Type II cells, 45 Type III cells, and 45 cells after capacitance measurement. Using the β-actin detectable samples, nested PCR was done for Kir3.1, Kir3.2, and Kir3.4. Primers for Kir3.1 PCR corresponded to nucleotides −10 to 10 and 760–781 (first PCR) and −10 to 10 and 736–757 (second PCR) of rat Kir3.1 cDNA (8Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Primers for Kir3.2 PCR corresponded to nucleotides 171–190 and 893–912 (first PCR) and 285–305 and 879–897 (second PCR) of rat Kir3.2 cDNA (22Lesage F. Duprat F. Fink M. Guillemare E. Coppola T. Lazdunski M. Hugnot J.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Primers for Kir3.4 PCR corresponded to nucleotides 904–923 and 1276–1294 (first PCR) and 989–1006 and 1246–1265 (second PCR) of rat Kir3.4 cDNA (17Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). For TSHβ PCR, primers corresponded to nucleotides 101–121 and 378–398 of rat TSHβ cDNA (23Croyle M.L. Bhattacharya A. Gordon D.F. Maurer R.A. DNA (N. Y.). 1986; 5: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, at 58 °C (Kir3.1), 60 °C (Kir3.2), 55 °C (Kir3.4), or 56 °C (TSHβ) for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 1 min and then at 72 °C for 8 min. Because the products from the single pituitary cell were insufficient for visualization, second cycles of reactions using the second PCR primers and the same amplification conditions were performed with a part of the first PCR products. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR products was confirmed with the dye primer method and DNA sequencer (A-381, Perkin-Elmer) after TA cloning (Invitrogen). Simultaneous measurements of changes in membrane capacitance (Cm), conductance (Gm), and membrane current (Im) were carried out using a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-7, List Electronics) and a two-phase lock-in amplifier (NF5610B, NF Electronic Circuit Design) as described previously (24Maruyama Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 807-814Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The capacitance transients originating from the capacitance of the plasma membranes were minimized by adjusting the capacitance and the time constant of the capacitance cancellation circuit in the patch-clamp amplifier while applying voltage pulses with an amplitude of 10 mV. This adjustment gave whole cell capacitance values of 9.0–13.4 picofarads and series resistance values of 5–9 megaohms. After the cancellation, a 600-Hz, 3.4-mV peak to peak sine-wave voltage was superimposed on the holding potential of −100 mV. The resulting current output was fed into the lock-in amplifier. The phase offset of the lock-in amplifier was adjusted so that when the capacitance of the cancellation circuit was modified to calibrate Cm, there was no change in the output for Gm (closed circles at theCm trace in Fig. 3 A). KG channels are heteromultimeric proteins composed of the subunits Kir3.1 + Kir3.4 in the heart (17Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) and Kir3.1 + Kir3.2 in the brain (25Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Fosset M. Romey G. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28660-28667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 26Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7137-7150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Kir3.1 subunit may therefore be common to the KG channels of various tissues (8Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 9Dascal N. Schreibmayer W. Lim N.F. Wang W. Chavkin C. DiMagno L. Labarca C. Kieffer B.L. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Trollinger D. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10235-10239Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We examined the distribution of Kir3.1 immunoreactivity in sections of rat pituitary using a specific polyclonal antibody (aG1C-1) (15Morishige K. Inanobe A. Takahashi N. Yoshimoto Y. Kurachi H. Miyake A. Tokunaga Y. Maeda T. Kurachi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Inanobe A. Morishige K. Takahashi N. Ito H. Yamada M. Takumi T. Nishina H. Takahashi K. Kanaho Y. Katada T. Kurachi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 1022-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The Kir3.1-positive cells were scattered in the anterior pituitary lobe and made up ∼3% of the anterior pituitary cells (Fig. 1 A). Under the light microscope Kir3.1 immunoreactivity was detected diffusely in the cytosol of each positive cell (Fig. 1, A and B). The Kir3.1-positive cells had a polygonal or stellate shape between 20 and 30 μm in size. To identify which types of pituitary cells express Kir3.1, sections were double-stained for Kir3.1 and various pituitary hormones. Fig. 1, B and C, shows that Kir3.1 immunoreactivity (green) was detected only in the cells that were stained with anti-TSH antibody (red). In 176 TSH-positive cells (i.e. thyrotrophs), 149 cells (∼85%) were also Kir3.1-positive. No Kir3.1 immunoreactivity was detected in cells stained with anti-prolactin, anti-growth hormone, anti-luteinizing hormone, or anti-ACTH antibodies. Prominentorange-yellow signals generated by the double staining ofgreen (Kir3.1) and red (TSH) suggest that they may be localized in close proximity in thyrotrophs (Fig.1 D). The subcellular localization of Kir3.1 was examined using immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 1, E, F, and H). The immunoreactive signals (gold particles) were detected predominantly on secretory vesicles and rarely on the plasma membrane of Kir3.1-positive pituitary cells (Fig. 1 E). The cells were ∼30 μm in diameter and polygonal in shape. The reactive intracellular secretory vesicles were ∼100 nm in diameter. These morphological features of Kir3.1-positive cells are those of the thyrotroph (27Ozawa H. Kurozumi K. Anat. Embryol. 1989; 180: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, with double immunolabeling under the electron microscope, we found that Kir3.1 (detected by 15-nm gold particles) and TSH (10-nm gold particles) were localized in the same secretory vesicles (Fig. 1 E, inset). In contrast, the adjacent cell, which contained large 200–300-nm-diameter electron dense vesicles, did not show any immunoreactivity to aG1C-1. Fig. 1, F and H, depicts examples of Kir3.1 immunoreactivity in the thyrotrophs obtained from TRH-administered rats. TRH stimulation caused an increase in the detection of gold particles on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 F,arrows). The number of gold particles detected on the plasma membrane in the control was 0.25 ± 0.25% (mean ± S.E.,n = 15 cells) of the total number of particles that existed within 1.5 μm of the plasma membrane. This number increased to 7.56 ± 1.80% (n = 15 cells) after TRH stimulation (Fig. 1 G). Furthermore, as indicated by thearrowheads in Fig. 1 H, after TRH stimulation various stages of fusion of the gold particle-positive vesicles with the plasma membrane were detected. These results suggest that the KG channels on the secretory vesicles of thyrotrophs could be translocated to the plasma membrane during TRH-induced exocytosis. It is known that dopamine-D2 and somatostatin receptors can couple to KG channels via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in pituitary cells (2Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Therefore, TRH-induced recruitment of the KG channels to the plasma membrane of thyrotrophs may in turn facilitate the effect of inhibitory transmitters such as dopamine and somatostatin. To examine this possibility, electrophysiological techniques were applied to dissociated pituitary cells (Fig. 2). From 82 cells examined, we observed three distinct types of cells in terms of their responses to bromocriptine, somatostatin, and TRH (Types I–III). Fig.2 A depicts a representative cell current record of the response of Type I cells (n = 6). The dopamine receptor agonist bromocriptine induced a small inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) current, which was markedly enhanced upon the addition of TRH to the bath. The enhanced bromocriptine-induced Kir current was inhibited by sulpiride, an antagonist for the dopamine receptor. After ∼10 min of wash-out of bromocriptine and sulpiride, somatostatin induced a small Kir current similar to that induced by bromocriptine under control conditions. The somatostatin-induced Kir current was also enhanced by the addition of TRH. In the six Type I cells, TRH increased the bromocriptine-induced KG current by 6.0 ± 0.5-fold (mean ± S.E.) and the somatostatin-induced KG current by 7.0 ± 0.8-fold, measured at the command pulse to −100 mV. TRH alone, in the absence of bromocriptine or somatostatin, did not induce any appreciable Kir current (data not shown). Both bromocriptine- and somatostatin-induced currents reversed at approximately −30 mV close to the equilibrium potential for K+ with 50 mm extracellular K+ and exhibited clear inward rectification (Fig.2 A, lower right panel). The currents activated slowly during hyperpolarizing command voltage pulses, which is a feature of KG channels containing Kir3.1 subunits (Fig.2 A, lower left panels) (17Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 25Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Fosset M. Romey G. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28660-28667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In RT-PCR analysis of cytoplasmic RNA aspirated from the cell presented in Fig.2 A, we detected transcripts of Kir3.1 and TSHβ as shown inlane 1 of Fig. 2 D. The same results were obtained in the remaining five Type I cells (including the result shown inlane 4 of Fig. 2 D). Thus, Type I cells are thyrotrophs that may possess KG channels containing the Kir3.1 subunit. Because it is known that homomeric KG channels composed of Kir3.1 are not functional (17Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) but that heteromers of Kir3.1 and another Kir3.0 subunit form functional KG channels, we have tried to identify the Kir3.0 subunit that may assemble with Kir3.1 in the vesicular KG channels. Kir3.3 was not detected by RT-PCR in the mRNA from whole anterior pituitary lobe (data not shown). Therefore, the expression of Kir3.2 and Kir3.4 subunits was examined by single-cell RT-PCR. All six Type I cells expressed a Kir3.4 transcript, and one of them also expressed Kir3.2. Furthermore, we detected Kir3.4 immunoreactivity (15-nm gold particles) on the vesicles containing TSH (10-nm particles) with electron microscopic immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2 E). Kir3.2 immunoreactivity was not detected on the vesicles (data not shown). These results suggest that Kir3.4 may be the subunit that makes up the vesicular KG channel with Kir3.1. In Type II cells (n = 21), bromocriptine or somatostatin induced a very small Kir current, which was not affected by TRH (Fig. 2 B). Lanes 2 and 5 in Fig. 2 D depict examples of RT-PCR analysis of Type II cell mRNA; lane 2 is from the cell shown in Fig.2 B. In the cytoplasmic RNAs of 10 cells of this type, we detected transcripts of Kir3.2 and/or Kir3.4 but not of Kir3.1. TSHβ mRNA was detected only in the cell shown in lane 2 but not in the remaining nine Type II cells. In Type III response cells (n = 55), bromocriptine or somatostatin did not induce any Kir current, and TRH showed no appreciable effect (Fig.2 C). We could not detect any transcripts of Kir3.1, Kir3.2, or TSHβ in 10 Type III cells examined (lane 3 in Fig.2 D is from the cell shown in Fig. 2 C). Two of the 10 Type III cells expressed Kir3.4 mRNA. In conclusion, TRH enhances bromocriptine or somatostatin activation of KGcurrent specifically in thyrotrophs, which express Kir3.1 mRNA. To examine whether the TRH-induced augmentation of KGchannel activity in Type I thyrotrophs is derived from the exocytosis of secretory vesicles, as was suggested by the electron microscopic examination (Fig. 1, E–H), we simultaneously measuredCm, Gm, and Imin Type I cells (Fig. 3 A). The cells were bathed in 5 mm K+ bathing solution and held at −100 mV. A 600-Hz sine wave with a peak to peak amplitude of 3.4 mV was applied to the cell under voltage clamp. The application of bromocriptine caused some increase of Gm and of the small inward K+ current without any significant effect on Cm. When TRH was added in the continued presence of bromocriptine, the inward K+ current was markedly enhanced in parallel with the simultaneous increase of bothCm and Gm. The increase ofCm may reflect the fusion of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane induced by TRH (28Neher E. Marty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In the continued presence of TRH, Cm, Gm, andIm fluctuated in parallel and slowly returned toward their basal levels. The decrease of Cm may represent endocytosis of membrane containing KG channels. This TRH-induced response was observed in 5 of 45 cells examined. In these 5 cells, expression of mRNAs of Kir3.1, Kir3.4, and TSHβ was confirmed by retrospective single-cell RT-PCR (data not shown). The remaining 40 cells did not express any Kir3.1transcript. The simultaneous measurement of Cm,Gm, and Im indicates that TRH-induced augmentation of KG channel activity in Type I cells is associated with the exocytosis of secretory vesicles. TRH-induced TSH secretion may be composed of voltage-dependent and voltage-independent components, as is the case for prolactin secretion by TRH in the lactotroph (29Fomina A.F. Levitan E.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4982-4991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in Cm measured in Fig. 3 A must represent a voltage-independent component because these experiments were conducted under voltage clamp. The TRH-induced voltage-independent fusion of secretory vesicles causes an increase in the number of KG channels on the plasma membrane. The increased KG channels should then facilitate the hyperpolarization induced by dopamine and somatostatin, which may suppress the depolarization-induced secretion. TRH-induced recruitment of vesicular KG channels to the plasma membrane may act as a feedback control mechanism to avoid excessive stimulation of the cell (Fig.3 B). At the crustacean neuromuscular junction, repetitive stimulation of motor nerves resulted in an increase of the number of active zones containing a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel at the axonal terminus, which was implicated in the long term facilitation of neurotransmitter release (30Wojtowicz J.M. Marin L. Atwood H.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3688-3703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increase of active zones is thought to be the result of the translocation to the plasma membrane of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel localized on secretory vesicles (31Passafaro M. Rosa P. Sala C. Clementi F. Sher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30096-30104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was shown that the number of postsynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors was rapidly increased by insulin (32Wan Q. Xiong Z.G. Man H.Y. Ackerley C.A. Braunton J. Lu W.Y. Becker L.E. McDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Nature. 1997; 388: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) or in an experimental model of temporal lobe epilepsy (33Nusser Z. Hajos N. Somogyi P. Mody I. Nature. 1998; 395: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The stimulation-induced increase of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors may underlie the long term modification of synaptic transmission in hippocampal inhibitory synapses (32Wan Q. Xiong Z.G. Man H.Y. Ackerley C.A. Braunton J. Lu W.Y. Becker L.E. McDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Nature. 1997; 388: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 33Nusser Z. Hajos N. Somogyi P. Mody I. Nature. 1998; 395: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). These previous studies require a mechanism that enables stimulation to translocate ion channels from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane. This study provides, for the first time, clear evidence to indicate that the localization of ion channels on secretory vesicles actually plays a role in the physiological regulation of membrane excitability. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms localizing ion channels on secretory vesicles.

The region corresponding to the α4-helix and α4-β6 loop of the transducin α-subunit (Gtα) has been implicated in interactions with the receptor and the effector. Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the α4-β6 region has been carried out to elucidate residues critical for the functions of transducin. The mutational analysis supports the role of the α4-β6 loop in the R*-Gtα interface and suggests that the Gtα residues Arg310 and Asp311 are involved in the interaction with R*. These residues are likely to contribute to the specificity of the R* recognition. Contrary to the evidence previously obtained with synthetic peptides of Gtα, our data indicate that none of the α4-β6 residues directly or significantly participate in the interaction with and activation of phosphodiesterase. However, Ile299, Phe303, and Leu306 form a network of interactions with the α3-helix of Gtα, which is critical for the ability of Gtα to undergo an activational conformational change. Thereby, Ile299, Phe303, and Leu306play only an indirect role in the effector function of Gtα.

The α-subunit of Gt (Gtα) complexed with GTP is then released to stimulate the effector enzyme, cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), by reversing the inhibiton imposed by two PDE γ subunits (Pγ) on the PDE catalytic dimer (Pαβ). Activated PDE rapidly hydrolyzes cGMP resulting in closure of cGMP-gated channels in the photoreceptor plasma membrane (1Chabre M. Deterre P. Eur. J.

The two central interactions of Gtα with R* and Pγ during visual excitation have been extensively investigated, and the Gtα interaction sites have been localized. Evidence points to the C terminus of Gtα as the major R* contact site that is critical for Gtα activation (4Van Dop C. Yamanaka G. Steinberg F. Sekura R.D. Manclark C.R. Stryer L. Bourne H.R. J.

A second essential site of Gtα interaction with R* includes the α4/β6 loop (residues 305–315) (6Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P.

Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The tryptic cleavage site at Arg310 of Gtα was protected upon Gtαβγ binding to R* (10Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30034-30040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Several mutants with Ala substitutions of residues from the α4/β6 loop had impaired binding to R* and reduced degrees of activation (11Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this R* binding site overlaps with a region of Gtα, Gtα-293–314, that has been implicated in the transducin-effector interaction (12Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E.

A synthetic peptide, Gtα-293–314, corresponding to the α4-β6 region was shown to activate PDE in vitro and to bind to Pγ (12Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E.

A study using substituted peptides identified five nonconserved effector residues within this region (16Spickofsky N. Robichon A. Danho W. Fry D. Greeley D. Graves B. Madison V. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Despite the large body of evidence, the significance of the Gtα α4-β6 region in the effector interaction remains unclear. An insertion of the Gtα-295–314 segment into Giα1only marginally improved the latter's ability to bind Pγ (17Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that if the α4-β6 region is important for the interaction with PDE, then likely the conserved residues within α4-β6 are essential for the function of the effector. Alternatively, even small differences in Gtα and Giα folding may interfere with the ability of Gtα-293–314 to assume the proper effector-binding conformation in the context of Giα. More importantly, the apparent ability of peptide Gtα-293–314 to potently stimulate PDE (12Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 16Spickofsky N. Robichon A. Danho W. Fry D. Greeley D. Graves B. Madison V. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Struct.

The latter indicates the requirement of the switch II and α3 regions for effector activation (18Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

In light of the importance of the Gtα α4-β6 region for the Gt-R* interaction and substantial but conflicting evidence on its role for PDE activation, we carried out Ala-scanning mutational analysis of the α4-helix (residues 293–304) and the α4-β6 loop of Gtα. Our analysis of mutant Gtα interactions with R* and PDE has underscored the role of the α4-β6 loop for the receptor function but revealed only indirect involvement of the α4-helix in the Gtα effector function via requirement of the α4/α3 coupling for the activational conformational change. Bovine ROS membranes were prepared as described previously (20Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Urea-washed ROS membranes (uROS) were prepared according to protocol described by Yamanaka et al. (21Yamanaka G. Eckstein F. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8094-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Gtβγ was purified according to Kleusset al. (22Kleuss C. Pallast M. Brendel S. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 407: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Pγ labeled with the fluorescent probe, 3-(bromoacetyl)-7-diethyl aminocoumarin (PγBC), was obtained and purified as described previously (23Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4188-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Substitutions of Gtα residues by Ala were introduced into Gtα/Giα1 chimeric protein, Gtα*, which contains only 16 residues from Giα. Gtα* was made based on another Gtα/Giα1 chimeric protein, Chi8, which is competent to interact with R* and Gtβγ (17Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To generate Gtα*, all the Giα residues in the α3-helix and the α3-β5 loop of Chi8, except for Met247 (corresponding to Leu243 of Gtα) were replaced by Gtα residues. The following Gtα residues were introduced into Chi8: His244, Asn247, His252, Arg253, Tyr254, Ala256, and Thr257. The PCR-directed mutagenesis was carried out essentially as described in Natochin et al. (19Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Single substitutions of Gtα residues at positions 293, 294, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, and 314 were introduced by PCR-directed mutagenesis. In the PCR reactions, forward mutant primers were paired with a reverse primer carrying a HindIII site and corresponding to a sequence 50 base pairs downstream of the stop codon. The pHis6-Gtα* plasmid was used as a template. The PCR products (∼200 base pairs) were purified on agarose gel and used for a second round PCR amplification as reverse primers combined with a forward primer containing the unique Gtα BamHI site. The 500-base pair PCR products were digested withBamHI and HindIII and ligated into pHis6-Gtα* cut with the same enzymes. The sequences of all mutants were verified by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. Gtα* and all mutants were expressed and purified as described previously (19Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Gtα* or mutants (0.4 μm each) were premixed with Gtβγ (2 μm) in 0.5 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl and 8 mmMgSO4. The binding of GTPγS to Gtα* or mutants was initiated by addition of 5 μm[35S]GTPγS (0.2 μCi) and uROS membranes (100 nm rhodopsin). Aliquots (100 μl) were withdrawn at the indicated times, passed through the Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (0.45 μm), washed three times with an ice-cold binding buffer and counted. The k app values for the binding reactions were calculated by fitting the data to the equation, GTPγS bound (%) = 100(1 −e −kt). Fluorescence assays of interaction between Gtα* and PγBC were performed on a F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi) in 1 ml of 20 mmHEPES buffer (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 4 mm MgCl2 essentially as described in (19Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4188-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the buffer contained 30 μm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF. Fluorescence of PγBC was monitored with excitation at 445 nm and emission at 495 nm. Concentration of PγBC was determined using ε445 = 53,000. The AlF4−-induced increases in the tryptophan fluorescence of Gtα*GDP and its mutants were recorded on an AB2 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Spectronic Instruments) in a stirred 1-ml cuvette with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 340 nm as described previously (19Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HoloPDE was extracted from ROS membranes and purified as described earlier (24Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PDE (0.2 nm) was reconstituted with 2 μmGtα*GDP or the GDP-bound Gtα* mutants and 2 μm Gtβγ in suspensions of uROS membranes containing 10 μm rhodopsin. GTPγS (10 μm) was added to the reaction mixture, and PDE activity was measured using [3H]cGMP similarly as described previously (19Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) using IgG as a standard or using calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm. Rhodopsin concentrations were measured using the difference in absorbance at 500 nm between “dark” and bleached ROS preparations. Fitting of the experimental data was performed with nonlinear least squares criteria using GraphPad Prizm (v.2) software. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of triplicate measurements. Examination of the crystal structure of Gtα was performed using RasMol (v.2.6) software. We have previously found that residue Leu243 of Gtα is mainly responsible for the low level expression of Gtα/Giα chimeras containing the Gtα-237–270 (α3-β5) segment (19Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Gtα* was obtained based on the Gtα/Giα chimera, Chi8, which contains the α3-β5 region of Giα (17Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The nonconserved Giα residues from the α3-helix and the α3-β5 loop of Chi8 were replaced by the corresponding Gtα residues (except for Leu243). Two of the introduced Gtα residues, His244 and Asn247, are important for the Gtα-PDE interaction (19Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The resulting chimeric Gtα was not only efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli (yields of soluble protein of 3–5 mg/liter culture) but was also fully competent for interaction with Gtβγ and R* and capable of high affinity effector binding. The ability of Gtα* to interact with R* in the presence of Gtβγ was evaluated using the GTPγS binding assay. The very slow GTPγS binding rate to Gtα* (k app = ∼0.004 s−1), which is limited by the rate of GDP dissociation (26Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 757-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was significantly accelerated in the presence of R* and Gtβγ (k app = ∼0.079 s−1) (Fig. 1). A fluorescence read-out assay was utilized to monitor the interaction between Gtα and the Pγ subunit (23Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4188-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using this assay, Gtα*GDP bound fluorescently labeled Pγ, PγBC, with aK d value of 28 nm (Fig.2 A and TableI). When Gtα*GDP was activated in the presence of AlF4− it bound to PγBC with an almost 6-fold higher affinity (K d of 5.1 nm) (Fig. 2 B and Table I). Thus, Gtα*, which contains only 16 Giα residues, represents a well suited tool for mutational analysis to identify residues that are essential for both receptor and effector interactions of transducin.Figure 2Binding of Gtα* to PγBC. The relative increase in fluorescence (F/Fo) of PγBC (10 nm) (excitation at 445 nm; emission at 495 nm) was determined after addition of increasing concentrations of Gtα*GDP in the absence (A) or in the presence (B) of AlF4−.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IInteraction of Gtα* mutants with PγBC and activation by R*Binding to PγBC (K d)GTPγS binding (k app)Gtα*GDP·AlF4−Gtα*GDPnms−1Gtα*5.1 ± 0.528 ± 20.079 ± 0.010E293A5.0 ± 0.820 ± 10.057 ± 0.012E294A4.4 ± 0.234 ± 20.059 ± 0.009N297A6.6 ± 0.749 ± 30.081 ± 0.003Y298A54 ± 749 ± 4I299A35 ± 337 ± 2K300A7.9 ± 0.742 ± 20.084 ± 0.009V301A7.5 ± 0.879 ± 60.077 ± 0.004Q302A6.9 ± 0.727 ± 20.073 ± 0.010F303A60 ± 850 ± 4L304A3.0 ± 0.428 ± 20.053 ± 0.003E305A3.5 ± 0.122 ± 30.065 ± 0.002L306A15 ± 134 ± 40.019 ± 0.001M308A6.5 ± 0.327 ± 10.079 ± 0.006R309A8.7 ± 1.233 ± 20.065 ± 0.003R310A4.8 ± 0.737 ± 30.034 ± 0.004D311A8.5 ± 0.934 ± 40.023 ± 0.001V312A4.2 ± 0.452 ± 20.095 ± 0.004K313A6.1 ± 0.473 ± 90.092 ± 0.005E314A7.9 ± 0.649 ± 20.107 ± 0.009 Open table in a new tab Residues at positions 293, 294, 297, 298, 300, 301, 302, 304, 305, 306, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, and 314 within the α4-helix and the α4-β6 loop of Gtα are surface exposed (27Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) and were substituted with Ala residues. In addition to a modestly solvent-exposed Leu306, two buried residues, Ile299 and Phe303, are involved in coupling the α4-helix with the α3-helix (27Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). This linkage might be important for stabilization of the receptor and/or effector-competent conformations of Gtα. Substitutions of Ile299and Phe303 were made to test this possibility. Expression of all but three of the Gtα* mutants in E. coli have yielded similar amounts of soluble proteins (∼3–5 mg/liter of culture). Mutants Y298A, I299A, and F303A had notably reduced expression levels (∼0.5–1 mg/liter). The crystal structure of GtαGTPγS shows that the Tyr298 side chain makes contact with Tyr286 from the αG-α4 loop, whereas Ile299 and Phe303 interact with the α3-helix (27Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Perhaps, the reduction in mutant expression reflects lower rates of proper protein folding due to the lack of stabilizing contacts between α4 and the αG-α4 loop or the α3-helix. The ability of Gtα mutants to undergo a conformational change upon addition of AlF4− was analyzed by measuring their intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (18Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mutants Y298A, I299A, and F303A failed to display an increase in tryptophan fluorescence upon addition of AlF4−, whereas the fluorescence change for L306A was intermediate to that for Gtα* (not shown). The ability of R* to interact with Gtα* mutants and cause them to release GDP was examined by measuring the rates of GTPγS binding to these mutants in the presence of R* and Gtβγ. The release of GDP is a rate-limiting step in activation of G protein α subunits, and thus it controls the rate of GTPγS binding (26Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 757-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three Gtα* mutants, Y298A, I299A, and F303A, did not appreciably bind GTPγS. A correlation between the low expression levels of these mutants and the lack of GTPγS binding indicates that defects in the overall folding might be responsible for the loss of the R*-dependent activation. However, the finding that these mutants were able to specifically interact with the effector (see below) rules out gross misfolding. Alternatively, the α4-α3 coupling could represent an important element in maintaining proper conformation of the R*-binding regions, or it is essential for the ability of Gtα to undergo a conformational change upon binding of GTPγS. The latter possibility is supported by the lack of the tryptophan fluorescence enhancement with addition of AlF4− to Y298A, I299A, and F303A. The GTPγS binding properties of the L306A mutant, in which another residue that contacts α3 was substituted, were seriously compromised but not abolished. Fitting of the GTPγS binding data for L306A yielded a value for maximal binding at ∼35% of that for Gtα* with an ∼4-fold lower rate (k app = ∼0.019 s−1) (Fig.3 and Table I). Gtα*L306A was expressed in E. coli comparably to Gtα* but showed diminished ability for the conformational change in the presence of AlF4−. This suggests that L306A has a similar but more mildly expressed phenotype than mutants Y298A, I299A, and F303A. A substantial loss of the receptor function was observed when Asp311 was replaced by Ala. The D311A mutant in comparison with Gtα* maximally bound only ∼50% GTPγS with a reduced rate of 0.023 s−1 (Fig. 3 and Table I). A relatively mild alteration in R* activation was found for the R310A mutant. Gtα*R310A had a saturating level of GTPγS binding similar to that of Gtα*, but the rate of binding was decreased by ∼2-fold (Fig. 3 and Table I). Previously, Arg309, Val312, and Lys313 were implicated in the Gtα-R* interaction using an assay of Gtα activation in microsomes of COS7 cells expressing rhodopsin and mutant Gt (11Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We observed no significant changes in the kinetics of Gtα* activation caused by these three or other remaining mutations under our experimental conditions (Table I). To delineate potential effector residues within the α4-β6 region, the Gtα* mutants in the GDP-bound or active AlF4−-induced conformations were tested for binding to PγBC. Interestingly, mutants Y298A, I299A, and F303A, which had low expression levels and lacked R*-induced GTPγS binding, in the GDP-bound conformations displayed affinities for PγBC comparable with Gtα*GDP (Table I). This result indicates that in the inactive conformation their effector interface is not significantly affected. Predictably, these three Gtα* mutants had significant defects in binding to Pγ in the presence of AlF4−. Addition of AlF4− produced no enhancement in the mutant interaction with PγBC, evidently due to the inability of these mutants to assume an active conformation. In addition, the interaction of the L306A mutant with PγBC was less sensitive than that of Gtα* to AlF4−. In the presence of AlF4−, L306A bound to PγBC with a K d only 2-fold lower than when AlF4− was absent (Table I). This is consistent with the limited competency of L306A to assume an active conformation. The Gtα* mutants, V301A and K313A, had mild defects in effector binding. These mutants retained a high affinity for PγBC in the AlF4−-bound conformations but revealed a somewhat reduced interaction with the effector in the absence of AlF4− (Table I). All other Gtα* mutants demonstrated affinities for PγBC comparable with that of Gtα (Table I). The ability of Gtα* mutants to stimulate activity of holoPDE (Pαβγ2) was tested in the reconstituted system with additions of uROS membranes and purified Gtβγ in the presence of GTPγS. Gtα* as well as the majority of its mutants activated holoPDE under these conditions by∼12–18-fold. Not surprisingly, mutants Y298A, I299A, and F303A were incapable of stimulating PDE (not shown). Mutants L306A and D311A were notably less effective in the PDE activation assay (Fig.4). This reduction in the effector function seems to correlate well with the decreased capacity of these mutants to bind GTPγS in the presence of R*. Therefore, residues Leu306 and Asp311 are unlikely to be directly involved in interaction with and activation of PDE. The α4-β6 region of Gtα is an essential contributor to the Gtα-rhodopsin interface (6Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 11Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The R* binding sites of Gtα, the α4-β6 loop (amino acids 305–315) and Gtα-340–350, are positioned on the same “receptor” face of Gtαβγ as the N terminus of Gtα and the C terminus of Gtγ (28Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The β6-sheet and the α5-helix project inward from the α4-β6 loop and Gtα-340–350 on the Gtα surface to form the β6/α5 loop. The latter contains a cluster of residues, Cys321, Ala322, and Thr323, intimately involved in binding of the guanine ring (27Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Mutations of the residues within the β6/α5 loop promote dissociation of GDP and GTP-GDP exchange on several Gα subunits (29Thomas T.C. Schmidt C.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10295-10298Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Iiri T. Herzmark P. Nakamoto J.M. van Dop C. Bourne H.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21752-21758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, the Gtα activation mechanism is likely to involve interaction of R* with the α4-β6 loop and Gtα-340–350, leading to conformational changes of the β6/α5 loop and dissociation of GDP. The critical R*-binding region, Gtα-340–350, has been investigated in great detail (6Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P.

However, the role of the Gtα α4-β6 loop and its individual residues in binding to R* and Gtα activation is not well understood. Recently, mutants of Gtα with Ala substitutions of residues in the α4-β6 loop have been translated in vitroand expressed in COS-7 cells (11Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis revealed that substitutions of four residues in the α4-β6 loop, Arg309, Asp311, Val312, and Lys313 impaired Gtα interaction with R* (11Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the Gtα α4-β6 region in the context of Gtα* readily expressed in E. coli has provided us with an opportunity for in depth investigation of the roles of individual α4-β6 residues in the receptor interaction. Reconstitution of the purified mutant Gtα* with Gtβγ and uROS membranes has enabled the examination of the effects of mutations on the kinetics of Gtα* activation by R*. Our results confirm the role of Asp311 in the R*-dependent activation of Gtα. A substitution of this residue led to a substantial decrease in both the rate of and total R*-induced GTPγS binding. A moderate alteration of the kinetics of R*-induced GTPγS binding was caused by the substitution of Arg310. The R310A mutant bound GTPγS with an ∼2-fold slower rate. Supporting the involvement of Gtα Asp311, and probably Arg310, in the interaction with R* is the fact that the trypsin cleavage site Arg310-Asp311 is protected upon binding of Gtα to R* (10Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30034-30040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition to effective activation of Gtα, R* is capable of activating Giα (17Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) but has no detectable interaction with Gsα. 2M. Natochin and N. O. Artemyev, unpublished observations. Arg310 and Asp311 of Gtα align with the Lys-Asp and Ser-Gly pairs in Giα and Gsα, respectively. Therefore, Arg310 and Asp311 along with Gtα-340–350 may contribute to the specificity of the Gtα-R* interaction. Mutations Y298A, I299A, and F303A caused the loss of Gtα* activation by R* or AlF4−, whereas the L306A mutation resulted in a less severe phenotype. This loss of function apparently resulted from the inability of the mutants to undergo the activational conformational change. Residues Ile299, Phe303, and Leu306 interact with Met239, Leu243, and Phe246, respectively (27Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). This interaction network between the α4 and α3 helices may secure the proper positioning of Glu241, Leu245, Ile249, and Phe255. The latter residues, upon activation of Gtα, engage the switch II residues Arg201, Arg204, and Trp207 to form another network of interactions, which is critical for the Gtα progression to the active conformation (33Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results suggest that the coupling between helices α3 and α4 is critical for the transition of Gtα to the active state. The key event in photoactivation of PDE is a direct interaction between the GTP-bound Gtα and Pγ. Both GtαGTP and GtαGDP are capable of binding Pγ. However, GtαGDP binds Pγ with ∼10–30-fold lower affinity and is incapable of efficient activation of PDE (23Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4188-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Otto-Bruc A. Antonny B. Vuong T.M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8636-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The Gtα binding sites on Pγ have been firmly established (13Artemyev N.O. Rarick H.M. Mills J.S. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25067-25072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lipkin V.M. Dumler I.L. Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Etingof R.N.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13210-13215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Pγ-binding surface on Gtα appears to be significantly more complex and less understood. Initially, the putative effector region of Gtα corresponding to the α4-helix and the α4-β6 loop was identified using synthetic Gtα peptides. A synthetic peptide, Gtα-293–314, potently (K a of 8 μm) stimulated activity of rod holoPDE (12Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) via binding to Pγ (13Artemyev N.O. Rarick H.M. Mills J.S. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25067-25072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitutions within the Gtα-293–314 peptide have been made, and five nonconserved residues, Asn297, Val301, Glu305, Met308, and Arg310, were found to contribute to the activational effects (16Spickofsky N. Robichon A. Danho W. Fry D. Greeley D. Graves B. Madison V. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, evidence contradicting the role of α4-β6 as a major effector domain of Gtα has emerged from analysis of chimeric Gtα/Giα proteins and mutagenesis of Gtα (17Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Two other effector-interacting domains of Gtα, the switch II region and the α3-helix-α3/β5 loop, have been identified (17Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These findings led to the apparent discrepancy between the ability of peptide Gtα-293–314 to activate PDE and the prerequisite of the switch II and α3-β5 regions of Gtα for the effector stimulation. Hypothetically, the discrepancy is nonexistent if the role of switch II and α3-β5 is only to obscure the α4-β6 region in GtαGDP. However, such a model is not supported by the crystal structures of Gtα (27Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 33Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Moreover, at least three residues, Ile208 (switch II), His244, and Asn247 (α3) are likely to interact directly with Pγ in the GTP-bound Gtα conformation (19Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Ala-scanning mutational analysis performed in this study demonstrated that none of the α4-β6 residues appear to participate directly and significantly in the Gtα/Pγ binding. Even substitutions of the residues Tyr298, Ile299, Phe303, and Leu306, which disabled the activation of Gtα*, had no notable impact on the binding of the GDP-bound mutants to PγBC. Results on activation of PDE by the Gtα mutants correlated well with the Pγ binding experiments. All mutants with unimpaired capacity for R*-induced GTPγS binding were competent to stimulate cGMP hydrolysis by holoPDE. The studies on cross-linking of Pγ to Gtα attest to a close proximity of Pγ to the α4-β6 region in the Gtα-Pγ complex (14Artemyev N.O. Mills J.S. Thornburg K.R. Knapp D.R. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26900-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although our analysis seems to rule out strong major interactions between Pγ and Gtα-293–314, a relatively weak van der Waals' contact(s) at this site cannot be entirely excluded. Rather, the role of the α4-β6 residues, Ile299, Phe303, and Leu306, is that they are critical for the activational conformational change via the interaction with the α3-helix and thus indirectly are important for the effector function of Gtα. The most surprising finding in this work is that none of the mutations of five Gtα residues identified using synthetic peptides (16Spickofsky N. Robichon A. Danho W. Fry D. Greeley D. Graves B. Madison V. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) meaningfully affected the Gtα*-PDE interaction. A greater sensitivity of the peptide structure than that of Gtα* to mutations may explain the different results. Although the NMR analysis of substituted peptides ruled out gross misfolding, inactivation of mutant peptides due to a conformational change remains a possibility (16Spickofsky N. Robichon A. Danho W. Fry D. Greeley D. Graves B. Madison V. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, a more plausible explanation is that the peptide Gtα-293–314 and Gtα activate PDE via different mechanisms. This raises a general concern regarding potential problems with interpretation of effects that might be observed using synthetic peptides as probes of protein-protein interactions. The conclusion that Gtα-293–314 likely represents a major effector-activating domain of Gtα was reached based on the ability of the peptide to “mimic” Gtα in PDE activation (12Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 16Spickofsky N. Robichon A. Danho W. Fry D. Greeley D. Graves B. Madison V. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and provided the best explanation of the data in the absence of an alternative approach. Yet, the puzzling mimicking effect of the Gtα peptide does not appear to reflect the role of the corresponding region in Gtα."
https://openalex.org/W2004950775,"Our previous study (El-Hayek, R., Antoniu, B., Wang, J. P., Hamilton, S. L., and Ikemoto, N. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 22116–22118) suggested the hypothesis that skeletal muscle-type excitation-contraction coupling is regulated by two domains (activating and blocking) of the II-III loop of the dihydropyridine receptor α1 subunit. We investigated this hypothesis by examining conformational changes in the ryanodine receptor induced by synthetic peptides and by transverse tubular system (T-tubule) depolarization. Peptide A, corresponding to the Thr671–Leu690 region, rapidly changed the ryanodine receptor conformation from a blocked state (low fluorescence of the conformational probe, methyl coumarin acetamide, attached specifically to the ryanodine receptor) to an activated state (high methyl coumarin acetamide fluorescence) as T-tubule depolarization did. Peptide C, corresponding to the Glu724–Pro760region, blocked both conformational changes induced by peptide A and T-tubule depolarization. Its ability to block peptide A-induced and depolarization-induced activation was considerably impaired by replacing the portion of peptide C corresponding to the Phe725–Pro742 region of the loop with cardiac muscle-type sequence. These results are consistent with the model that depolarization-induced activation of excitation-contraction coupling and blocking/repriming are mediated by the peptide A region and the peptide C region (containing the critical Phe725–Pro742 sequence) of the II-III loop, respectively. Our previous study (El-Hayek, R., Antoniu, B., Wang, J. P., Hamilton, S. L., and Ikemoto, N. (1995)J. Biol.

The critical role of the II-III loop was recognized first by an earlier finding of Tanabe et al. (8Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 9Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) that replacement of the II-III loop of the cardiac DHP receptor with the skeletal muscle-type sequence conferred the skeletal muscle-type E-C coupling activity in dysgenic myotubes expressing chimeric DHP receptors. This concept was further supported by the finding that a recombinant peptide corresponding to the II-III loop activated ryanodine binding and Ca2+ channel activity (10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies with shorter peptides corresponding to various regions of the II-III loop have permitted new insight into functionally important subdomains of the loop. A 61-residue recombinant peptide corresponding to the Glu666–Glu726 region activated the RyR, suggesting that the ability of activating E-C coupling is localized in this region (11Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A372Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar). According to our studies with a series of synthetic peptides corresponding to different regions of the loop (12El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), only one peptide corresponding to the Thr671–Leu690 region (designated peptide A) activated ryanodine binding and induced Ca2+ release from SR (12El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Activating functions of peptide A are retained in a truncated form of peptide A, corresponding to Arg681–Leu690, but further truncation abolished its activity (13El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that an essential domain for the activation of E-C coupling (designated the “activator” of E-C coupling) is localized in the Arg681–Leu690 region of the II-III loop. The concept that there is another important domain of the II-III loop that may be involved in the regulation of E-C coupling has emerged from the findings as follows. As reported in our recent paper (12El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a synthetic peptide corresponding to the Glu724–Pro760region of the II-III loop (designated peptide C), but not other peptides, inhibited peptide A-induced activation of the RyR. This suggests that the Glu724–Pro760 region of the loop may serve as an antagonist of the activator described above. The idea that this portion is critical for E-C coupling has also emerged from the recent report by Nakai et al. (14Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konnno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). According to the report, chimeric replacement of the Phe725–Pro742 region of the II-III loop (the region corresponding to the N-terminal half of peptide C) from cardiac type to skeletal muscle type conferred the E-C coupling properties of skeletal muscle-type to dysgenic myotubes expressing cardiac-type DHP receptor. Thus, there appear to be at least two important domains of the II-III loop that are required for skeletal muscle-type E-C coupling. The main purpose of the present study is to gain new insight into the mechanism by which E-C coupling is regulated by these two domains of the II-III loop. As shown in the present study, peptide A produces a rapid change of the RyR conformation from a resting state to an activated state, and peptide C reverses this process. Interestingly, these changes induced by peptide A and peptide C correspond to the conformational changes induced by T-tubule depolarization and polarization, respectively. This predicted that peptide C would counteract not only peptide A-dependent activation of the RyR but also depolarization-induced activation of E-C coupling. To test this, we investigated the effects of peptide C on depolarization-induced conformational change in the RyR and Ca2+ release from the SR. As shown here, depolarization-induced changes in the RyR to an active conformational state and Ca2+ release from SR were blocked or reversed by peptide C. These results suggest a new concept, that depolarization-dependent activation of E-C coupling and polarization-dependent repriming of the system are modulated by the voltage-dependent alternative binding of the activator domain (the in situ counterpart of peptide A) and the blocker/primer domain (the in situ counterpart of peptide C), respectively, to the E-C coupling site(s) of the RyR. The triad-enriched microsomal fraction was prepared from rabbit leg and back muscles by differential centrifugation as described previously (15Ikemoto N. Kim D.H. Antoniu B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After the final centrifugation, the sedimented fraction was homogenized in a solution containing 0.3 m sucrose, 0.15 m gluconate, proteolytic enzyme inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.8 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) and 20 mm MES, pH 6.8 (PI buffer), to a final protein concentration of 20–30 mg/ml. The preparation was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 431 A synthesizer employing Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) as the α-amino protecting group. Amidated peptides were cleaved and deprotected with 95% trifluoroacetic acid. Purification was carried out by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a Rainin Instruments preparative C8 column. Purified peptides were then dialyzed against water using a dialysis membrane with a cutoff M rof 500. Five millimolar solutions of peptides were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Triad vesicles (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated in 0.1 ml of a reaction solution containing 8–10 nm [3H]ryanodine (68.4 Ci/ml, NEN Life Science Products), 0.3 m KCl, 100 μm EGTA, 64.4 μm CaCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2 for 2 h at 36 °C in the absence or in the presence of various concentrations of peptides. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the binding in the absence (total binding) and in the presence (nonspecific binding) of 10 μmnonradioactive ryanodine (16El-Hayek R. Valdivia C. Valdivia H.H. Hogan K. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 779-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out in duplicate, and each data point was obtained by averaging the duplicates. Site-specific fluorescent labeling of the RyR moiety of the triad was performed using the cleavable hetero-bifunctional cross-linking reagent sulfosuccinimidyl 3-((2-(7-azido-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetamido)ethyl)dithio)propionate (SAED) (17Kang J.J.

Kang J.J. Ikemoto N. Shohet S.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with the aid of neomycin as a carrier in the following way. First, neomycin-SAED conjugates were formed by incubating 0.4 mm neomycin with 0.2 mm SAED in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) for 15 min at 22 °C in the dark. The reaction was quenched by a 10-fold dilution with 10 mmlysine. Twenty ml of the neomycin-SAED conjugate (final neomycin concentration, 20 μm) was mixed in the dark with 300 mg of triad protein, brought to 300 ml with PI buffer, and photolyzed with UV light in a Pyrex tube at 4 °C for 10 min. β-Mercaptoethanol was added (final concentration, 100 mm) to cleave the disulfide bond of SAED. After incubation on ice for 1 h, the mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 × g, and the sedimented triads were resuspended in PI buffer to a final protein concentration of ∼20 mg/ml. The neomycin-mediated incorporation resulted in the specific incorporation of the MCA into the RyR moiety of the triad as determined by fluorometry of electrophoretically separated protein bands (cf. Ref. 17Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.M. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3293-3298Google Scholar). Although there was a small decrease in the activity of the RyR after MCA incorporation, the labeled triads retained sufficient activities of ryanodine binding (77.3 ± 9.7% of the unlabeled preparation) and depolarization-induced Ca2+ release (cf. Ref.19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To induce conformational changes in the RyR by peptide A, a base solution (150 mm potassium gluconate, 15 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1.61 mm CaCl2, 20 mm imidazole, pH 6.8; [Ca2+] = 1.0 μm) containing the MCA-labeled triads (2.0 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of the base solution containing various concentrations of peptide A using a stopped-flow apparatus (BioLogic SFM4). To induce conformational changes in the RyR induced by T-tubule depolarization, we used the K+ to Na+replacement protocol, which was originally devised in the skinned fiber system by Lamb and Stephenson (20Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1990; 423: 495-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1990; 423: 519-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and was adopted to our triad system (19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The MCA-labeled triads were first polarized by incubating the triads (2.0 mg/ml) within the base solution (see above) containing 5.0 mm Mg·ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase) for 10–15 min. Then, the T-tubule moiety was depolarized by mixing 15 μl of the solution containing the polarized triads with 135 μl of depolarization solution (150 mm sodium gluconate, 15 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1.61 mmCaCl2, 20 mm imidazole, pH 6.8; [Ca2+] = 1.0 μm) using a stopped-flow apparatus (BioLogic SFM4). The time courses of fluorescence change of the protein-bound MCA (excitation at 368 nm, emission at 440 nm using an interference filter with a 70-nm bandwidth) induced by peptide A or T-tubule depolarization were monitored with the stopped-flow fluorometer (BioLogic SFM-4 with MOS-200 optical system) as described previously (19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The triads were first polarized by incubating the triads (2.0 mg/ml) as described above. To depolarize the T-tubule, 15 μl of the polarization solution containing the polarized triads was mixed with 135 μl of depolarization solution (see above) containing 2.5 μm fluo-3, as described previously (22Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The time course of Ca2+ release was monitored in a stopped-flow fluorometer (BioLogic SFM4) using fluo-3 as the Ca2+indicator (excitation at 437 nm, emission at 530 nm with a 510-nm cut-off filter). Peptide A, corresponding to the Thr671–Leu690 region of the II-III loop, mimics some features of a physiologic activation of E-C coupling in skeletal muscle, whereas peptide C, corresponding to the Glu724–Pro760 region of the loop, blocks the activation by peptide A (12El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This has led us to the hypothesis that the RyR is regulated by these two portions of the II-III loop in a reciprocal fashion. Fig. 1 Ashows the effects of various concentrations of peptide C on the ryanodine binding activity in the absence or in the presence of peptide A. In agreement with our recent report (12El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), peptide C alone has virtually no effect on ryanodine binding in the range of the concentrations tested. In the presence of 30 μm peptide A, which produced a near maximal enhancement of ryanodine binding (see Fig. 1 A, inset), peptide C blocked peptide A-dependent enhancement with an IC50 (the concentration for half maximal inhibition) of about 50 μm. At 200 μm, peptide C produced an almost complete blocking of the peptide A-dependent activation. Thus, peptide C reverses the activation of the RyR by peptide A, although peptide C alone has no direct effect on the RyR. In other words, peptide C seems to regulate the RyR by serving as an antagonist of the activating peptide A. As described above, the N-terminal half of peptide C (see theunderlined portion of peptide C in the sequence shown below) corresponds to the so-called “determinant of skeletal muscle-type E-C coupling” (the Glu726–Pro742 region of the II-III loop) (23Nakai J. Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A14Google Scholar), the skeletal muscle-type sequence of which seemed to be essential for the skeletal muscle-type E-C coupling. In order to test the importance of the type of sequence in this segment, we synthesized a chimeric peptide C by changing this segment to cardiac type sequence (see the segment of chimeric peptide C withitalic letters). As shown in Fig. 1 A and TableI, the extent of blocking of peptide A-dependent activation by chimeric peptide C (chimeric C) was significantly less than that by peptide C, indicating that the skeletal muscle-type sequence in this region is important for the blocking function of peptide C. In light of the suggested importance of the skeletal muscle-type sequence of this segment for E-C coupling (l.c.), it is suggested that blocking function residing in the peptide C region of the II-III loop is in fact required for E-C coupling besides the activating function located in the peptide A region. View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We previously found that shorter peptides of peptide C,viz. peptide C1 and peptide C2(corresponding to the Phe725–Gly743 and Asp740–Pro760 regions of the II-III loop, respectively; see the above sequence), had no appreciable effect on peptide A-dependent activation up to 50 μm(12El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Further studies with higher concentrations of these shorter peptides revealed new features, shown in Fig. 1 B. As seen, peptide C1 had again virtually no blocking effect even at higher concentrations, indicating that the N-terminal half of peptide C alone is not capable of competing with peptide A. Interestingly, however, peptide C2 produced a small but significant competition with peptide A at high concentrations. The addition of equimolar concentrations of peptide C1 to peptide C2 produced little or no additional change in the extent of blocking by peptide C2. From these findings, we propose that a relatively large region (presumably the whole length of peptide C) is required for an effective blocking of peptide A-dependent activation. As seen in the above scheme, peptide C2 contains a cluster of negatively charged residues (DDEEDE). Because the cluster of positively charged residues located in peptide A seems to play a key role for its activating function (13El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the cluster of acidic residues located in the peptide C2 region likely plays a key role in the blocking function of peptide C. We tentatively propose that the blocking function is localized in the C2 region, but the C1 region with the skeletal muscle-type sequence is required for some other functions, such as the binding of peptide C to the RyR.Table IThe concentrations of peptide C and its derivatives for their IC50 of peptide A (30 μm)-induced enhancement of ryanodine bindingPeptideIC50μmPeptide C57.0 ± 10.8Chimeric C245.7 ± 75.0C13089.8 ± 1607.6C2289.3 ± 75.9C1 + C2221.7 ± 20.0Number of each experiment = 5. Data are mean ± S.D. Open table in a new tab Number of each experiment = 5. Data are mean ± S.D. As seen in Fig. 1 and Table I, the extent of blocking by chimeric peptide C (Fig. 1 A) is about the same as that by peptide C2, or an equimolar mixture of C1 and C2 (Fig. 1 B). This indicates that the partial blocking of peptide A-dependent activation by chimeric peptide C described above is solely due to the inhibitory function localized in the C-terminal half of chimeric peptide C. In the experiments shown in Fig. 1 C, we investigated the effects of increasing concentrations of peptide C on enhancement of ryanodine binding by the generally used Ca2+release-inducing reagents caffeine (24Wyskovsky W. Hohenegger M. Plank B. Hellmann G. Klein S. Suko J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Palade P. Settbarn C. Brunder D. Stein P. Hals G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 295-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and polylysine (26Cifuentes M.E. Ronjat M. Ikemoto N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27El-Hayek R. Yano M. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15634-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As seen, peptide C had no effect on both caffeine- and polylysine-dependent enhancement, even at the high concentrations investigated. Thus, peptide C is a specific blocker of peptide A. This is consistent with the view that peptide C is competing with peptide A at the specific E-C coupling site(s) of the RyR. Although ryanodine binding assays provide a convenient method for the assessment of conformational states of the RyR, the assay is not suitable for monitoring rapid conformational changes occurring in the RyR. Stopped-flow fluorometry of the fluorescent conformational probe, MCA, specifically attached to the RyR moiety (17Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.M. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3293-3298Google Scholar, 19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15634-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) permits us to study rapid conformational changes in the RyR with a high temporal resolution. In the experiment shown in Fig.2 A, we investigated the effects of peptide A on the conformational state of RyR by means of the stopped-flow fluorometry. As seen, peptide A induced a rapid increase in the MCA fluorescence (ΔF) in a dose-dependent manner. An increase of the peptide concentration up to 50 μm resulted in an increase in both the magnitude (A) and the rate constant (k) of ΔF. Upon further increase of peptide A concentration, however, the activation by peptide A was somewhat suppressed. Fig. 2 Bshows the [peptide A] dependence of the initial rate of ΔF (i.e. A·k value). Importantly, the general pattern of the dose-dependent activation seen here (Fig. 2 B) shows a striking resemblance to that obtained from the ryanodine binding assay (cf. Fig. 1 A, inset). This indicates that ryanodine binding and MCA fluorescence assays can provide us with the essentially identical information about the functional/conformational state of the RyR, although only the MCA fluorometry permits a sufficient temporal resolution for the studies of the activator-induced rapid conformational changes. Fig. 3 A depicts time courses of conformational changes of the RyR when the vesicles were incubated first with various concentrations of peptide C and then 30 μm peptide A was added to activate the RyR. As seen, peptide A-induced ΔF was blocked significantly by peptide C in a concentration-dependent manner. The [peptide C] dependence of the reduction of the initial rate of peptide A-induced fluorescence change is shown in Fig. 3 B. The [peptide C] dependence of the blockage is similar to that shown in the ryanodine binding assay (Fig. 1), although the IC50 in the stopped-flow assay (approximately 30 μm, Fig.3 B) is somewhat lower than that in the ryanodine binding assay (approximately 50 μm, Fig. 1). These results indicate that peptide C blocks the peptide A activation by interfering with the binding of peptide A to the RyR. The isolated triad preparation contains two classes of RyRs: coupled RyRs, which are linked with the T-tubule DHP receptors, and free RyRs, which are not linked with the DHP receptors. In this preparation, the population of free RyRs must be significantly larger than that of the coupled RyRs due to the fact that a significant portion of the previously coupled RyRs (which had been about 50% of the total RyR population (28Block B.A. Imagawa T. Campbell K.P. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2587-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 29Franzini-Armstrong C. Kish J.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Franzini-Armstrong C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 509-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar)) must have been dissociated from T-tubules during fragmentation and isolation of the vesicles. Furthermore, the rapid accessibility of the added peptide A to the activating site(s), which seems to be critical for rapid activation of the RyR in those stopped-flow experiments, would be much higher in the free RyRs than the coupled RyRs. Therefore, these data in Fig. 3 seem to represent almost primarily the conformational response of the free RyRs to the added peptides, although peptide A may also be accessible to the coupled RyRs. Diagram FD1 Asummarizes our interpretation of the above data. Binding of peptide A to the putative E-C coupling site(s) of the RyR produces a rapid conformational change from the state with low MCA fluorescence to the new state with high MCA fluorescence, which leads to the enhancement of ryanodine binding and Ca2+ release from the SR (cf. Refs. 19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and 27El-Hayek R. Yano M. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15634-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Peptide C by itself produces virtually no change in the RyR conformation. However, activation of the RyR by peptide A, viz. the increase in the MCA fluorescence level, was blocked by peptide C owing to the competition between peptide A and peptide C to the specific E-C coupling site(s). As described above, peptide A increases MCA fluorescence, and peptide C reverses the peptide A-induced increase of MCA fluorescence. This is reminiscent of similar fluorescence changes occurring in the coupled triads. Namely, the fluorescence intensity of the RyR-bound MCA increases upon T-tubule depolarization, whereas it decreases upon T-tubule polarization (31Ikemoto N. El-Hayek R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Such a tight correlation between the two experiments, one in the free RyRs and the other in the coupled RyRs, suggests the following hypothesis (cf. DiagramFD1 B). Upon T-tubule depolarization, the region of the II-III loop corresponding to peptide A (activator of E-C coupling) will bind to the E-C coupling site(s) of the RyR, leading it to an active conformational state with a high MCA fluorescence (cf. Refs.19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and 31Ikemoto N. El-Hayek R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Upon T-tubule polarization, the RyR-bound activator will be replaced by the region of the II-III loop corresponding to peptide C, leading to a blocked (or primed) state of the RyR with a low MCA fluorescence. In order to test this model, we monitored MCA fluorescence increase induced by T-tubule depolarization (at a level of G10, cf.Ref. 22Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in the presence of various concentrations of peptide C. The important feature of this experiment is that only the RyRs linked with the T-tubule DHP receptor show voltage-dependent conformational (MCA fluorescence) changes. This is in sharp contrast to the activation by general activators of the RyR (Ca2+, caffeine, polylysine, etc.), which will react with both free and coupled RyRs. This provides us with a straightforward method for testing the effect of peptide C on the voltage-dependent operation of the II-III loop. In the experiment shown in Fig.4 A, the vesicles were first incubated with various concentrations of peptide C, and after priming the system (viz. after polarizing the T-tubule and loading the SR with Ca2+ (19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)), the T-tubule moiety was depolarized (see “Experimental Procedures”). As seen, depolarization-induced MCA fluorescence increase (i.e. the voltage-dependent formation of an active conformational state of the RyR) was blocked by peptide C in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 was 20 μm as determined from the d[F]/dtversus [peptide C] plot (Fig. 4 B), which is essentially identical with the IC50 for the peptide C inhibition of the peptide A-dependent activation (Fig.3 B). We also carried out the same type of experiments as in Fig. 4 A by adding equivalent concentrations of peptide C simultaneously with T-tubule depolarization (rather than depolarizing after preincubation with peptide C). The degree of inhibition by peptide C without preincubation was almost identical with that after preincubation, although the former was somewhat smaller than the latter. These results suggest that the occupancy of peptide C at the E-C coupling site(s) of the RyR interfered with the voltage-dependent binding of the activator domain of the II-III loop to the site(s), although the voltage-dependent changes in the position of the II-III loop domains may be occurring in a normal way. The magnitude of the relative MCA fluorescence increase (ΔF/F o) induced by T-tubule depolarization (about 4%, Fig. 4 A) was significantly larger than that induced by a maximally activating concentration of peptide A (about 1%, Fig. 3 A). This is rather surprising, because the population of the coupled RyRs responsible for the former event is significantly smaller than that of the free RyRs responsible for the latter, as described above. The most reasonable explanation for this would be that the changes in the fluorescence intensity are greatly enhanced in the coupled RyRs because of their location in the space between the T-tubule and SR membranes, which is presumably a more hydrophobic environment than that of the free RyRs. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4 C, we compared the extent of inhibition of depolarization-induced MCA fluorescence by peptide C and that by chimeric peptide C at 200 μm. In good agreement with the results of ryanodine binding assay (cf.Fig. 1), the potency of blocking depolarization-induced conformational change is significantly less in chimeric peptide C compared with peptide C. This indicates again that the skeletal muscle-type sequence of the region corresponding to the Glu726–Pro742 region of the II-III loop is important for peptide C to exert an efficient reversal of the in situ mechanism of activation. Because the formation of active conformational state of the RyR (i.e. high MCA fluorescence state) is a prerequisite for the channel opening and Ca2+ release (cf. Refs. 19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,27El-Hayek R. Yano M. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15634-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), inhibition of this process by peptide C should also inhibit Ca2+ release from the SR. In the experiment shown in Fig.5 A, we investigated the effects of various concentrations of peptide C on depolarization-induced Ca2+ release from the SR. As seen, peptide C in fact blocked depolarization-induced Ca2+release in a concentration-dependent manner. Fig.5 B shows the [peptide C] dependence of the reduction of the initial rate of Ca2+ release. The dose-dependent reduction of the initial Ca2+release rate (Fig. 5 B) is similar to that of depolarization-induced conformational change. We also carried out the same type of experiment with some control peptides. As described previously (12El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), peptide B and peptide D (which represent the Arg694–Val722 and Pro760–Val790 regions, respectively, of the II-III loop in the neighborhood of the peptide C region) had no effect on peptide A-induced Ca2+ release. As seen in TableII, neither peptide B nor peptide D had any appreciable effect on depolarization-induced Ca2+release, even at 200 μm.Table IIThe initial rates of Ca2+ release induced by T-tubule depolarization in the presence of 200 μm peptide C and the equivalent concentration of control peptides (peptides B and D)AdditionInitial Ca2+ release ratenmol/mg/s0435.8 ± 73.9Peptide B440.5 ± 101.7Peptide C38.7 ± 23.0Peptide D389.5 ± 65.3Peptides B, C, and D correspond to the Arg694–Val722, Glu724–Pro760, and Pro760–Val790regions of the II-III loop, respectively.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) described that there is a considerable amount of inconsistency in the literature concerning the proposed locations of critical domain(s) of the II-III loop. However, many (if not all) of those apparently inconsistent findings, together with the present findings, may be explained by a general hypothesis as elaborated below. First, the finding by Nakai et al. (14Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konnno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) that replacement of a short segment of the cardiac loop with the corresponding skeletal residues Phe725–Pro742was sufficient to produce skeletal type E-C coupling has led to their suggestion that this region may serve as an “agonist,” rather than the peptide A region being the activator. This suggestion was based upon the assumption that the cardiac sequence of the peptide A region of the loop would have no capability of activating the RyR1 (14Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konnno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, as shown in our recent report, both skeletal and cardiac sequences of the critical 10-residue portion of peptide A (peptide A-10) can activate the RyR1, although cardiac peptide A-10 is somewhat weaker than its skeletal counterpart (cf. Figs. 3 and 6 of Ref.13). We propose that both skeletal and cardiac loops have a common activating domain in the peptide A-10 region, which has a similar amino acid sequence (skeletal, RKRRKMSGRL; cardiac, KERKKLARTA,cf. Ref. 13El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This concept can well explain an earlier finding that both skeletal and cardiac constructs of the II-III loop activated the RyR1 (10Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This concept is also in accord with the recent report that the II-III loop construct subjected to mutations within the peptide A-10 region became incapable of interacting with the 37-residue construct of the RyR (32Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Then what makes the region of skeletal residues Phe725–Pro742 essential for E-C coupling without having an agonist function? The present study provides some clues to this question. As shown (cf. Fig. 3 A), peptide C blocked MCA fluorescence increase induced by both peptide A and T-tubule depolarization. Furthermore, according to our preliminary data, the addition of peptide C to the depolarized triads resulted in a decrease of MCA fluorescence (data not shown). These results would indicate that upon T-tubule polarization, the peptide C region of the II-III loop binds to the RyR in replacing the activator domain, which results in a blocked or resting conformational state of the RyR (cf. Diagram FD1 B). The binding of the blocker to the RyR to form its resting state is essential for E-C coupling presumably for the purpose of repriming the system. This is because without it, a new cycle of E-C coupling cannot take place (cf. Diagram FD1 B). The Phe725–Pro742 region corresponds to the N-terminal half of peptide C (i.e. peptide C1), and replacement of this portion to the cardiac sequence produced a significant reduction in the blocking (or priming) ability of peptide C, as shown in the present study. Furthermore, as suggested from the present data (see Fig. 1 B), the peptide C1region may serve as a mechanism to link the inhibitory peptide C2 region to the RyR. Thus, it is not unreasonable to speculate that the Phe725–Pro742 segment may serve as a link of the whole loop to the RyR as well. Some of the discrepancies in the literature may be at least partly ascribable to the difference in the method of approach. Synthetic or constructed peptides would be accessible to their designated sites in an unrestricted manner. On the other hand, in chimeras, all of those domains under discussion are parts of the II-III loop; hence, their accessibility to the RyR must be restricted and controlled in a voltage-dependent manner. Therefore, it is likely that the activator located in the Arg681–Leu690 region of the II-III loop becomes accessible to the RyR only after the two events have occurred: first, binding of the Phe725–Pro742 segment to the RyR, and second, depolarization of the T-tubule membrane. Thus, the accumulated pieces of information in the literature, although apparently inconsistent, can be explained by a unified scheme. Namely, the regulation of skeletal muscle-type E-C coupling by the II-III loop is mediated not by a single particular domain, but by multiple domains with different roles. We tentatively propose three such domains: activator, linker, and blocker/primer, located in the A, C1, and C2 regions of the II-III loop, respectively. The hypothesis that E-C coupling in skeletal muscle may be regulated by at least two domains of the II-III loop (activator and blocker, located in the Thr671–Leu690 and Glu724–Pro760 regions, respectively) was tested. Several pieces of new evidence shown here support this concept. First, peptide C (synthetic peptide corresponding to the blocker region) blocked T-tubule depolarization-induced conformational change in the RyR as well as Ca2+ release from the SR. Second, peptide C also blocked conformational changes in the RyR induced by peptide A (synthetic peptide corresponding to the activator region). The [peptide C] dependence of inhibition of depolarization-induced conformational change was similar to that of peptide A-induced conformational change, supporting the notion that voltage-dependent activation of the RyR is mediated by the region of the II-III loop corresponding to peptide A. Third, replacement of the portion of peptide C, which corresponds to the determinant of skeletal muscle-type E-C coupling (14Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konnno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), from the skeletal muscle-type sequence to the cardiac type produced a significant reduction of the blocking ability of peptide C. This suggests that skeletal-type E-C coupling requires not only the activating function localized in the peptide A region of the II-III loop but also the blocking function residing in the peptide C region. Based upon these findings, we propose the following mechanism (cf. Diagram FD1 B). Depolarization-induced activation of E-C coupling is mediated by the binding of the activator (located in the region of the II-III loop corresponding to peptide A) to the specific E-C coupling site(s) of the RyR. The binding of the blocker (located in the other region of the II-III loop corresponding to peptide C) to the E-C coupling site(s) removes the activator from the site(s) in a competitive manner. The binding of the blocker/primer is mediated by polarization of the T-tubule, and this step is a prerequisite to the next cycle of depolarization-induced activation. Therefore, this segment is one of the domains that are essential for E-C coupling. For the sake of simplicity of the model, we tentatively assume that the activator and the blocker bind to the same regulatory site of the RyR in a competitive manner. However, it is also possible that they bind to different sites of the RyR."

We have found that the ST6Gal-I isoforms are phosphorylated on luminal Ser and Thr residues. Immunoprecipitation of 35S- and32P-labeled proteins expressed in COS-1 cells suggests that the STTyr isoform is phosphorylated to a greater extent than the STCys isoform. Analysis of domain deletion mutants revealed that STTyr is phosphorylated on stem and catalytic domain amino acids, whereas STCys is phosphorylated on catalytic domain amino acids. An endoplasmic reticulum retained/retrieved chimeric Iip33-ST protein demonstrates drastically lower phosphorylation than does the wild type STTyrisoform. This suggests that the bulk of the ST6Gal-I phosphorylation is occurring in the Golgi. Treatment of cells with the ionophore monensin does not significantly block phosphorylation of the STTyrisoform, suggesting that phosphorylation is occurring in the cis-medial Golgi prior to the monensin block. This study demonstrates the presence of kinase activities in the cis-medial Golgi and the substantial phosphorylation of the luminal sequences of a glycosyltransferase.

Their activity is required for the synthesis of important sialylated oligosaccharide structures that modulate or mediate a variety of interactions. These include selectin-leukocyte interactions in inflammation and lymphocyte homing; virus, parasite, and toxin binding to host cells; maintenance of glycoproteins in the circulation; cell interactions in B cell maturation and activation; and antiadhesive effects during metastasis and development (for review, see Ref. 1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar). Many of the glycosyltransferases have been precisely localized in the cisternae of the Golgi of various cell types (for review, see Ref. 2Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). From these localization studies, it appears that the glycosyltransferases are organized throughout the Golgi cisternae in roughly the same order in which they act to add sugar residues to the growing oligosaccharide chains. It has been presumed that this relatively strict localization pattern allows for efficient glycosylation by ensuring that enzymes are compartmentalized with their glycoconjugate substrates and sugar nucleotide donors. In support of this idea, recent studies have shown that differential compartmentalization of enzymes that compete for the same substrates does alter the types of oligosaccharide structures made by the cell (3Skrincosky D.

In addition to compartmentalization, other post-transcriptional or post-translational events may control glycosyltransferase activity. Glycosyltransferases have been found as soluble forms in a variety of body fluids (5Bartholomew B.A. Jourdian G.W. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Not surprisingly, many of these enzymes are cleaved and secreted after expression in tissue culture cells (12D'Agostaro G. Bendiak B. Tropak M. Eur. J.

McEntee K. Lai P.-H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17735-17743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This type of turnover restricts the residence time of the enzymes in the Golgi and their function as glycosyltransferases. Recently, we have found that there are two isoforms of ST6Gal-I (ST)1 which differ by a single amino acid at position 123 in the catalytic domain (22Ma J. Qian R. Rausa III, F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This single amino acid difference leads to alterations in activity, localization, and proteolytic processing and secretion. The higher activity STTyr isoform is found in the Golgi and at low levels on the cell surface, whereas the lower activity STCys isoform is found exclusively in the Golgi and even in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) upon overexpression. Most notably, the STTyr isoform is cleaved and secreted with a half-time of 3–6 h, whereas the STCys remains completely cell-associated over long periods of time. These results suggest that differences in the conformation of the STTyr and STCys catalytic domains lead to differences in their trafficking and that this results in differences in their proteolytic processing. Phosphorylation of cytoplasmic sequences has also been implicated in controlling the catalytic activity and trafficking of glycosyltransferases. For example, Scheideler and Dawson (23Scheideler M.A. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1639-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) showed that activity of the UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine GM3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase is increased by a cytoplasmic cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation event. Yu and colleagues (24Gu X. Preuss U. Gu T. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) demonstrated that incubation of purified CMP-NeuAc:GM1 and CMP-NeuAc:LacCer sialyltransferases with protein kinase C decreased the activities of these enzymes in a time-dependent manner and that phosphatase treatment reversed this inhibition. Because protein kinase C is a cytoplasmic enzyme, it is unclear whether the sites phosphorylated in thesein vitro studies are phosphorylated in vivo. Work done by Strous et al. (25Strous G.J. Kerkhof P. Fallon R.J. Schwartz A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) demonstrated that β1,4-galactosyltransferase is phosphorylated on Ser residues. Their results suggest that the majority of phosphoserine is found in the cytoplasmic sequences of the enzyme, and they suggest a potential role for phosphorylation in the trafficking and targeting of the galactosyltransferase. However, to our knowledge, substantial phosphorylation of glycosyltransferase luminal sequences has not been reported previously. Here we report that both ST6Gal-I isoforms are phosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues in different cell types. The phosphorylation is confined to the luminal sequences with the STTyrphosphorylated on stem and catalytic domain sequences and the STCys phosphorylated on catalytic domain sequences only. Retention of the STTyr luminal sequences in the ER abolishes nearly all enzyme phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation occurs in the Golgi or a post-Golgi compartment. Treatment of cells with monensin blocks STTyr cleavage and secretion but not STTyr phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of the ST occurs in the cis-medial Golgi cisternae.

All other chemicals, including monensin, and phosphoamino acid standards were purchased from Sigma. The ΔStem, ΔTail, and ΔStemΔTail mutants of the STCys protein were constructed as described previously (26Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7784-7793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The STTyrforms of these mutants were constructed by converting the STCys versions to the STTyr form by replacing the BglII fragment from the STCys forms with that of the STTyr form. This 608-base pair fragment consists of nucleotides 322–930 and contains the codon for amino acid 123, the amino acid that differs in the two isoforms. The full-length Iip33 coding sequence in pCMV IV was obtained from Dr. William W. Young, University of Louisville. A fragment containing the coding sequence of the amino-terminal Iip33 cytoplasmic tail plus upstream untranslated sequences from the pCMV IV vector which include aBamHI site was obtained by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase, the sense primer 5′-AAG TCT AGA ATA AAC GCT CAA CTT TGG-3′ (based on sequences in the pCMV IV vector), and the antisense primer 5′-CGG AAT TCG CGG CTG CAC-3′ (based on sequences encoding the carboxyl-terminal end of the Iip33 tail). To facilitate cloning, the antisense primer was engineered to incorporate an EcoRI site at the 3′-end of the Iip33 tail fragment. A fragment containing the STTyrtransmembrane region, stem region, and catalytic domain (ST-trunc) was obtained by PCR using STTyr-pSVL as a template, the sense primer 5′-ACC GAA TTC AAG AAA AAG TTC AGC-3′, and the antisense primer 5′-GCT CTA GAC AAC GAA TGT TCC G-3′. To facilitate cloning, the primers incorporated an EcoRI site at the 5′-end of the ST-trunc fragment and a XbaI site at the 3′ end of the ST-trunc fragment. The antisense primer also abolished the existing stop codon in the ST sequence. The ST-trunc fragment was first cloned into the V5-pcDNA 3.1 vector (the EpiTag vector from Invitrogen) using existing EcoRI and XbaI sites in the vector's polylinker. This cloning step fused the V5 epitope tag and 6His sequences to the carboxyl terminus of the ST-trunc and reintroduced a stop codon following these tagging sequences. This new construct (ST-trunc-V5-pcDNA 3.1) was digested with BamHI (in vector polylinker) and EcoRI (site engineered into ST-trunc sequence) and the BamHI/EcoRI cleavage product of the Iip33 fragment ligated into the vector using T4 DNA ligase (New England Bio:labs). The new Iip33-ST-V5-pcDNA 3.1 construct was verified by restriction enzyme digestions and DNA sequencing. The resulting Iip33-ST construct includes the entire Iip33 cytoplasmic tail (Met-Asp-Asp-Gln-Arg-Asp-Leu-Ile-Ser-Asn-Asn-Glu-Gln-Leu-Pro-Met-Leu-Gly-Arg-Arg-Pro-Gly-Ala-Pro-Glu-Ser-Lys-Cys-Ser-Arg) (27Claesson L. Larhammar D. Rask L. Peterson P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7395-7399Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), containing its ER retention/retrieval signal (Arg-Arg), followed by Glu and Leu and then the ST transmembrane region, stem region, and catalytic domain fused to the V5 epitope tag and 6His sequence. The experiments comparing the phosphorylation, localization, and cleavage of the Iip33-ST to that of the STTyr also used a STTyr coding sequence cloned into the V5-pcDNA 3.1 vector. To clone the STTyr into this vector, the entire STTyr coding sequence lacking the original stop codon was obtained by PCR using STTyr-pSVL as the template, a sense primer based on the pSVL sequences 5′ to the ST insert (5′-GCT CTA AAC CGG AT-3′), and the same antisense primer used for PCR of the ST-trunc sequences for the Iip33-ST-V5-pcDNA 3.1 construct (shown above). The PCR product was cut with BamHI (in pSVL polylinker) andXbaI and ligated into these sites in the V5-pcDNA 3.1 vector polylinker resulting in the STTyr-V5-pcDNA 3.1 construct. COS-1 cells maintained in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum were plated on 100-mm tissue culture dishes and grown in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until 50–70% confluent. Lipofectin transfections were performed according to protocols provided by Life Technologies, Inc. Briefly, 30 μl of Lipofectin was incubated with 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM for 40 min at room temperature in a polystyrene tube. 20 μg of DNA was mixed with 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM, added to the Lipofectin solution, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cells to be transfected were washed with Opti-MEM, and the transfection mixture was added to the tissue culture dishes. Cells were incubated with the DNA-Lipofectin transfection solution (3 ml) for 6 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator. After 6 h, 7 ml of DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum were added to the plates, and expression was allowed to continue for 16 h in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Pulse-chase analysis and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (22Ma J. Qian R. Rausa III, F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For labeling of proteins with [35S]methionine/cysteine, transfected COS-1 cells (in 100-mm culture dishes) were incubated with methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM for 1 h. The medium was removed and replaced with 3 ml of fresh methionine-free DMEM containing 100 μCi/ml35S-Express protein labeling mix, and the cells were labeled in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 4 h. The radioactive medium was then removed, the cells were washed extensively, and 3 ml of DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum was added, and the cells were incubated in the CO2 incubator for a chase time of 2 h. Cell medium was collected at each time point, and the cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors. For labeling of proteins with32P, transfected COS-1 cells were incubated in DMEM without sodium phosphate for 30 min in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and 3 ml of DMEM without sodium phosphate containing 2 mCi of 32P was added to the cells. Cells were incubated with label for 2–4 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed once with 10 ml of PBS and either lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (described above) or chased with DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 h. In some experiments, the medium was also collected. ST proteins were immunoprecipitated from both cell lysates and medium using anti-ST antibody and protein A-Sepharose as described previously (22Ma J. Qian R. Rausa III, F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For treatment of cells with monensin, transfected cells were incubated in phosphate- or methionine/cysteine-deficient DMEM containing 10 μm monensin (Sigma) for 1 h in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. The same concentration of monensin was maintained throughout the labeling and chase periods. Radiolabeled cell lysate and medium fractions were processed and immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Bio-Rad prestained broad range gel standards were used to estimate molecular mass: myosin, 203 kDa; β-galactosidase, 118 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 82 kDa; ovalbumin, 49.2 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 34.8 kDa; soybean trypsin inhibitor, 29.4 kDa; lysozyme, 19.2 kDa; aprotinin, 7.5 kDa. To estimate roughly the number of mol of phosphate/mol of ST protein, we performed a double labeling experiment using [35S]methionine and 32P. 100-mm plates of transfected COS-1 cells were incubated for 1 h in methionine- and sodium phosphate-free DMEM specially prepared by Life Technologies, Inc. Cells were then labeled for 3 h with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine and 2 mCi of 32P in 3 ml of fresh methionine- and sodium phosphate-free DMEM. Cells were washed extensively with PBS and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5 mm activated sodium orthovanadate (Sigma). ST proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates as described above and immunoprecipitates counted in a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter using different windows for 35S (0–670) and32P (670–1,000) radioactivity. Spillover of32P radioactivity into the 35S window was determined and taken into account when doing final calculations. To eliminate contributions from nonspecifically immunoprecipitated material, similar experiments were performed on nontransfected COS-1 cells, and these values were subtracted from those of transfected cells. Calculations were made on the basis of specific activities provided by the vendors (1,000 Ci/mmol, [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 9,104 Ci/mmol, 32P (ICN)). One-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis was performed to identify phosphoamino acids according to the method described in the protocol included with the HTLE (Hunter thin layer electrophoresis) 7000 apparatus (C. B. S. Scientific Company, Inc. (Del Mar, CA). The 32P-labeled immunoprecipitated ST proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to PVDF membrane. Proteins were hydrolyzed and amino acids eluted from the membrane according to the method of Kamps and Sefton (28Kamps M.A. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane was washed three times for 2 min each in deionized water with continuous agitation. After washing, the membrane was wrapped in Saran Wrap and exposed to x-ray film. According to the band pattern on the x-ray film, the desired bands were excised from the PVDF membrane. The excised membranes were wetted in methanol for 1 min followed by a 1-min incubation in deionized water. Then the excised membranes were immersed in 6 n HCl and incubated at 110 °C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to another tube and lyophilized. The sample was then dissolved in 10 μl of deionized water and spotted on a flexible cellulose thin layer chromatography plate (100-μm thickness). Phosphoamino acid standards were loaded on the same spot. The plate was wetted using pH 3.5 electrophoresis buffer (0.87m acetic acid, 0.5% pyridine, 0.5 mm EDTA) and electrophoresed at 1.3 kV for 45 min on a HTLE 7000 apparatus. After electrophoresis, the plate was dried in a 60 °C oven for 20 min. The phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by spraying the plate with ninhydrin and reheating it in the 60 °C oven for 10 min. To visualize the labeled phosphoamino acids, the plate was exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (22Ma J. Qian R. Rausa III, F.M. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were plated on glass coverslips and transfected with the designated expression vectors. After 16 h of expression, cells were fixed and permeabilized using −20 °C methanol. After washing, cells were subjected to 1-h incubations with blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum, PBS), a 1:100 dilution of affinity purified rabbit anti-rat α2,6-ST antibody in blocking buffer, and a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody in blocking buffer. Cells were washed 4 × 5 min in PBS after primary and secondary antibody incubations. After the final wash, coverslips were mounted on glass slides and cells visualized and photographed using a Nikon Axiophot microscope equipped with epifluorescence illumination and a 60 × oil immersion Plan Apochromat objective. Analysis of the biosynthesis and processing of the ST6Gal-I suggested that the ST undergoes a post-translational modification that is not related toN-linked glycosylation. This modification results in a slight molecular mass increase (data not shown). One possibility is that the enzyme is phosphorylated either on its single cytoplasmic Thr or on luminal Ser, Thr, or Tyr residues. To test this possibility, we expressed both ST isoforms (STTyr and STCys) in COS-1 cells and labeled these cells for 4 h with 32P or 35S-Express protein labeling mix. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using affinity-purified anti-ST antibodies, and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1). In COS-1 cells, the ST proteins were labeled with 32P, demonstrating that they are modified by phosphate residues. We also observed 32P labeling of the two isoforms expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and of the endogenous ST proteins expressed in the rat hepatoma cell line FTO2B (data not shown and Fig. 2). Comparison of the levels of 35S-labeled and 32P-labeled proteins in COS-1 cells suggested that the STTyr isoform appeared to be more highly phosphorylated than the STCysisoform (also see Fig. 3).Figure 2ST isoforms are phosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues when expressed in COS-1 cells or FTO2B rat hepatoma cells. One-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis was performed to identify phosphoamino acids in the ST proteins. The32P-labeled immunoprecipitated ST proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to PVDF membrane. 32P-Labeled protein bands were hydrolyzed directly on the PVDF membrane by incubation with 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 1 h (28Kamps M.A. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Hydrolyzed samples and phosphoamino acid standards were electrophoresed on a flexible cellulose thin layer chromatography plates at 1.3 kV for 45 min using an HTLE 7000 apparatus. Phosphoamino acid standards were visualized using ninhydrin, and their positions are indicated in the figure. Labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by exposing the plate to x-ray film at −80 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3STTyr is phosphorylated in the stem and catalytic domains, whereas STCys is phosphorylated only in the catalytic domain. COS-1 cells transiently expressing unaltered STTyr and STCys and ΔStem, ΔTail, or ΔTailΔStem mutants of both isoforms were labeled with ∼660 μCi/ml 32P for 2 h in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. ST proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and immunoprecipitates analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography as described under “Methods.” [35S]Methionine/cysteine labeling and immunoprecipitation revealed that relatively equivalent levels of these proteins were expressed in identical transfection experiments (data not shown). Protein molecular mass marker: 49.2 kDa, ovalbumin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To obtain an estimate of the stoichiometry of ST protein phosphorylation, we performed double-labeling experiments using [35S]methionine and 32P. Transfected COS-1 cells were labeled for 3 h with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine and 2 mCi of 32P. Cells were washed and lysed, and ST proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and analyzed for both 35S and 32P radioactivity (for details, see “Methods”). Immunoprecipitations were also performed on cell lysates from untransfected control cells to eliminate any contribution from nonspecifically immunoprecipitated proteins. We found that both STTyr and STCysisoforms incorporated between 0.18 and 0.32 mol of phosphate/mol of protein (average, 0.25 mol of phosphate/mol of protein) in duplicate experiments. Experiments below suggest that these steady-state labeling experiments are likely to yield a minimum estimate of stoichiometry because phosphorylation of these proteins occurs primarily in the Golgi (see Fig. 5), and a significant proportion of the35S-labeled protein could be in the ER and therefore not phosphorylated. The results indicate that at least 25% of the total ST molecules are phosphorylated, or alternatively, that a smaller proportion of ST molecules possess multiple phosphorylated amino acids. Work by Eipper and Mains (29Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4907-4915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that 41–63% of adrenocorticoptropin hormone is phosphorylated in vivo, and work by Liberti et al. (30Liberti J.P. Antoni B.A. Chlebowski J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 17–33% of ovine growth hormone is phosphorylated in vivo. The levels of ST phosphorylation compare well with the levels of phosphorylation of these other phosphoproteins that are likely to receive their phosphate as they traverse the secretory pathway. Phosphoamino acid analyses of the32P-labeled, immunoprecipitated STTyr and STCys proteins expressed in COS-1 cells and the endogenous enzyme expressed in FTO2B rat hepatoma cells demonstrated that Ser and Thr residues are phosphorylated in both isoforms and in both cell lines (Fig. 2). No phosphotyrosine residues were detected. Interestingly, the levels of Ser and Thr phosphorylation differed in the two cell lines. In COS-1 cells, 50–60% of the phosphate residues were found on Thr and 40–50% on Ser, whereas in FTO2B cells 27% of the phosphate residues were found on Thr and 73% on Ser. It is possible that either differences in compartmentation and/or differences in resident kinases can account for differences in the ratio of Ser to Thr phosphorylation in COS-1 and FTO2B cells. Because two ST isoforms possess a single Thr residue in their cytoplasmic tails which could be phosphorylated, the presence of Ser phosphorylation and the differences in STTyr and STCys phosphorylation levels in COS-1 cells argued that the luminal sequences of the isofor"

In the present work we subject [CI-2(1–40)·(41–64)], a noncovalent complex formed by the association of two complementary fragments of the chymotrypsin inhibitor-2, to high pressure to investigate the folding mechanism of a model protein. Pressures up to 3.5 kilobar do not affect the intact protein, but it can be unfolded reversibly by pressure in the presence of subdenaturing concentrations of guanidine chloride, with free energy and molar volume changes of 2.5 kcal mol−1 and 42.5 ml mol−1, respectively. In contrast, the complex can be reversibly denatured by high pressure without the addition of chemical denaturants. However, the process is clearly independent of the protein concentration, indicating lack of dissociation. We determined a change in the free energy of 1.4 kcal mol−1 and a molar volume change of 35 ml mol−1 for the pressure denaturation of the complex. A persistent quenching of the tryptophan adds further evidence for the presence of residual structure in the high pressure-denatured state. This state also appears to be compact as the small volume change indicates, compared with pressure denaturation of naturally occurring dimers. Based on observations of a number of pressure-denatured states and on characteristics of large CI-2 fragments with a solvent accessible core but maintaining tertiary interactions, the structure of the pressure-denatured state of the CI-2 complex could be explained by an ordered molten globule-like conformation."

To investigate the mechanism of this inhibition, MTALs were perfused in vitroin Na+-free solutions, and apical and basolateral membrane Na+/H+ exchange activities were determined from rates of pHi recovery after lumen or bath Na+addition. NGF (0.7 nm in the bath) had no effect on apical Na+/H+ exchange activity, but inhibited basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity by 50%. Inhibition of basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity with ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA) secondarily reduces apical Na+/H+ exchange activity and HCO3− absorption in the MTAL (Good, D.

To determine whether a similar mechanism could explain inhibition of HCO3− absorption by NGF, apical Na+/H+ exchange activity was assessed in physiological solutions (146 mm Na+) by measurement of the initial rate of cell acidification after lumen EIPA addition. Under these conditions, in which basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity is present, NGF inhibited apical Na+/H+ exchange activity. Inhibition of HCO3− absorption by NGF was eliminated in the presence of bath EIPA or in the absence of bath Na+. Also, NGF blocked inhibition of HCO3− absorption by bath EIPA. We conclude that NGF inhibits basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity in the MTAL, an effect opposite from the stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange by growth factors in other systems. NGF inhibits transepithelial HCO3− absorption through inhibition of basolateral Na+/H+ exchange, most likely as the result of functional coupling in which primary inhibition of basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity results secondarily in inhibition of apical Na+/H+exchange activity.

The kidney is also a site of production of numerous growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor (NGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (30Hammerman M.R. O'Shea M. Miller S.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on their prominent stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange activity in other systems, these factors could influence multiple cellular processes in renal tubules, including urinary acidification, through effects on Na+/H+ exchange activities. At present, however, the effects of locally produced growth factors on Na+/H+ exchangers and their related functions in renal tubules are poorly understood. The medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL) of the mammalian kidney participates in the regulation of acid-base balance by reabsorbing a sizeable fraction of the HCO3− filtered at the glomerulus (31Good D.W. Semin. Nephrol. 1993; 13: 225-235PubMed Google Scholar). The proton secretion required for this HCO3− absorption is mediated virtually completely by apical membrane Na+/H+ exchange (25Good D.W. Watts III, B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F691-F699PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the regulation of HCO3− absorption is achieved largely through regulation of this apical exchanger (24Good D.W. J. Biol.

Invest. 1997; 99: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The MTAL also contains a basolateral membrane Na+/H+ exchanger that is active at the resting pHi (33Sun A.M. Kikeri D. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F241-F247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Good D.W. George T. Watts III, B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12525-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In general, it has been assumed for renal tubules that basolateral membrane Na+/H+ exchange opposes transcellular HCO3− absorption because it diminishes net base efflux (2Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mackovic-Basic M. Kurtz I. Semin. Nephrol. 1990; 10: 122-131PubMed Google Scholar, 14Preisig P.A. Alpern R.J. Kidney Int. 1991; 39: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Contrary to this view, however, we recently demonstrated that inhibiting basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity with ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA) decreased transepithelial HCO3− absorption in the MTAL (36Good D.W. George T. Watts III, B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12525-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This decrease was the result of a functional interaction between the basolateral and apical membrane Na+/H+exchangers, in which primary inhibition of basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity secondarily inhibited apical Na+/H+ exchange activity, thereby decreasing HCO3− absorption (36Good D.W. George T. Watts III, B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12525-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These studies established that the HCO3−absorption rate in the MTAL is dependent not only on the activity of the apical membrane Na+/H+ exchanger, but also on the activity of the basolateral membrane Na+/H+ exchanger. However, physiological factors that regulate HCO3− absorption through effects on basolateral membrane Na+/H+exchange activity have not been identified. In view of their potent stimulation of Na+/H+exchange activity in other systems, we recently investigated the effects of growth factors on HCO3−absorption by the MTAL. These studies demonstrated that NGF inhibits HCO3− absorption in the MTAL through a tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling mechanism (37Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C931-C939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibition was unexpected since it cannot readily be explained by the classical action of growth factors to stimulate Na+/H+ exchange activity. Instead, our results suggested that NGF may inhibit Na+/H+ exchange activity in the MTAL. The purpose of the present study was to examine directly the effects of NGF on apical and basolateral membrane Na+/H+ exchange activities to determine the mechanism by which NGF inhibits HCO3−absorption. Our results demonstrate that, in contrast to the virtually universal stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange by growth factors in other cells, NGF inhibits basolateral membrane Na+/H+ exchange activity in the MTAL. We also demonstrate that the inhibition of basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity mediates NGF-induced inhibition of transepithelial HCO3−absorption. MTALs from male Sprague-Dawley rats (60–90 g; Taconic Farms Inc., Germantown, NY) were perfused in vitro as described previously (32Good D.W. J. Clin.

To measure transepithelial HCO3−absorption rates, tubules were perfused and bathed in control solution that contained 146 mm Na+, 4 mmK+, 122 mm Cl−, 25 mmHCO3−, 2.0 mmCa2+, 1.5 mm Mg2+, 2.0 mm phosphate, 1.2 mmSO42−, 1.0 mm citrate, 2.0 mm lactate, and 5.5 mm glucose (equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.45, at 37 °C). Bath solutions also contained 0.2 g/100 ml fatty acid-free bovine albumin. In one series of HCO3−transport experiments (see Fig. 5 B), Na+ in the bath solution was replaced completely withN-methyl-d-glucammonium (NMDG+). Experimental agents were added to the bath solutions as described under “Results.” The length of the perfused tubule segments ranged from 0.48 to 0.67 mm. The protocol for study of transepithelial HCO3− absorption was as described (32Good D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,37Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C931-C939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tubules were equilibrated for 20–30 min at 37 °C in the initial perfusion and bath solutions, and the luminal flow rate was adjusted to 1.4–2.0 nl/min/mm. Two or three 10-min tubule fluid samples were then collected for each period (initial, experimental, and recovery). The tubules were allowed to re-equilibrate for 5–15 min after an experimental agent was added to or removed from the bath solution. The absolute rate of HCO3−absorption (J HCO3−, pmol/min/mm) was calculated from the luminal flow rate and the difference between total CO2 concentrations in perfused and collected fluids (32Good D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When repeat measurements were made at the beginning and end of an experiment (initial and recovery periods), the values were averaged. Single tubule values are presented in the figures. Means ± S.E. (n = number of tubules) are presented below. pHi was measured by use of the pH-sensitive dye 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein and a computer-controlled spectrofluorometer (CM-X, Spex Industries) coupled to the perfusion apparatus as described previously (34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W.

The tubules were perfused in the same manner used for HCO3− transport experiments, except that the lumen and bath solutions were delivered via rapid flow systems that permit complete exchange of the solutions in <2 s (36Good D.W. George T. Watts III, B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12525-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 38Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Gen.

Intracellular dye was excited alternately at 500- and 440-nm wavelengths, and emission was monitored at 530 nm using a photon counter. Intracellular dye was calibrated using high K+/nigericin standards at the end of each experiment to convert fluorescence excitation ratios (F 500/F 440) to pHi values, as described previously (34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20250-20255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 917-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Na+/H+ exchange activities were determined using two previously described methods (34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20250-20255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Good D.W. George T. Watts III, B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12525-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the first method (34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20250-20255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Na+/H+ exchange rates (J Na/H, pmol/min/mm) were determined by measuring initial rates of pHi recovery after addition of Na+ to the lumen or bath solutions. The tubules were perfused and bathed initially in HEPES-buffered solution that contained 145 mm Na+, 4 mm K+, 147 mm Cl−, 2.0 mmCa2+, 1.5 mm Mg2+, 1.0 mm phosphate, 1.0 mmSO42−, 1.0 mm citrate, 2.0 mm lactate, 5.5 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES (equilibrated with 100% O2, titrated to pH 7.4). The perfusate also contained furosemide to block Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport-mediated changes in cell Na+ concentration or volume. After a stable pHi was reached, Na+ was replaced completely with NMDG+ in the lumen and bath solutions. Bilateral Na+ replacement unmasks a background acid loading process that reduces the pHi to 6.5–6.7 (34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20250-20255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apical Na+/H+ exchange activity was then determined by measurement of the rate of pHi increase after readdition of Na+ to the tubule lumen. H+ flux rates were calculated as (dpHi/dt) × βi ×V, where dpHi/dt is the initial slope of the record of pHi versus time (pH units/min) measured over the first 4 s following an experimental maneuver (34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20250-20255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), βi is the intrinsic intracellular buffering power (mmol/liter·pH unit), and V is cell volume/mm of tubule length (nl/mm). βi was measured in the presence and absence of NGF as a function of pHi using previously described methods (34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20250-20255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). V, determined from inner and outer tubule diameters (12Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C920-C931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9883-9889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20250-20255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was 0.30 ± 0.01 nl/mm. NGF had no effect on βi or V. To determine the pHi dependence of apical membrane Na+/H+ exchange, the Na+-dependent pHi recovery was interrupted at various points along the recovery curve by luminal Na+ removal (NMDG+) plus EIPA, which unmasks background acid loading (34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20250-20255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Boron W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5921-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At the point of interruption, the Na+/H+ exchange rate is calculated as the difference between the net recovery rate and the background acid loading rate (34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20250-20255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Boron W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5921-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This approach permits the Na+/H+ exchange rate to be determined over a range of pHi values, with appropriate corrections for a variable background acid loading rate. Basolateral membrane Na+/H+ exchange rates were determined using similar protocols, i.e. by measuring rates of pHirecovery after readdition of Na+ to only the bath solution. In experiments in which apical or basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity was measured, EIPA was present on the opposite side of the tubule to eliminate any contribution of the contralateral exchanger to the Na+-induced changes in pHi. Apical membrane Na+/H+ exchange activity was also assessed using a second method (36Good D.W. George T. Watts III, B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12525-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MTALs were perfused and bathed in the control solution used for HCO3− transport experiments, and apical Na+/H+ exchange activity was determined by measuring the initial rate of cell acidification in response to rapid addition of 50 μm EIPA to the tubule lumen. In this analysis, J Na/H = (dpHi/dt) × βT × V, where dpHi/dt is the initial rate of pHi decrease after lumen EIPA addition, βT is the sum of βi and buffering power due to HCO3−/CO2 (computed as 2.3 [HCO3]i) (36Good D.W. George T. Watts III, B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12525-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and V is cell volume measured in control solution (0.28 ± 0.02 nl/mm). The basis for this approach is that, prior to EIPA addition, H+ extrusion via the apical Na+/H+ exchanger balances background acid loading to maintain pHi constant (36Good D.W. George T. Watts III, B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12525-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Boron W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5921-5924Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When the apical exchanger is inhibited, the initial rate of cell acidification estimates the steady-state rate of apical Na+/H+ exchange that balances background acid loading (36Good D.W. George T. Watts III, B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12525-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Results are presented as means ± S.E. Differences between means were evaluated using Student's t test for paired or unpaired data, as appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Previously, we demonstrated that NGF inhibits HCO3− absorption in the MTAL (37Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C931-C939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding was confirmed in three experiments in the present study (Fig.1). Addition of 0.7 nm NGF to the bath decreased HCO3− absorption by 30%, from 13.5 ± 0.8 to 9.3 ± 0.6 pmol/min/mm (p < 0.05). The inhibition was observed within 15 min after addition of NGF to the bath and was reversible. To identify the mechanism by which NGF inhibits HCO3− absorption, we examined directly the effects of NGF on apical and basolateral membrane Na+/H+ exchange activities. Na+/H+ exchange rates were determined from rates of pHi recovery measured after addition of Na+ to the lumen or bath solutions (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results in Fig.2 A show that NGF had no effect on apical membrane Na+/H+ exchange activity over the pHi range 6.7–7.7. The apical exchanger exhibited a sigmoidal dependence on pHi, as described previously (34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20250-20255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Hill plot of the combined data gave a V max of 68 pmol/min/mm, an apparent pK of 7.26, and a Hill coefficient of 1.8, values in close agreement with those obtained previously for MTALs in isosmotic solutions (34Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20250-20255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NGF also had no effect on the steady-state pHi reached after lumen Na+ addition (7.74 ± 0.05 without NGF (n = 6)versus 7.76 ± 0.05 with NGF (n = 4);p = not significant). Thus, we found no evidence for direct coupling of the NGF pathway to regulation of apical membrane Na+/H+ exchange activity. The MTAL also contains a basolateral membrane Na+/H+ exchanger that is active at the resting pHi (36Good D.W. George T. Watts III, B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12525-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 2 B show that NGF decreased basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity by at least 50% at all pHi values studied. For data points grouped over the pHi interval 6.9–7.1, NGF decreased the basolateral Na+/H+ exchange rate from 14.8 ± 0.6 to 6.8 ± 0.7 pmol/min/mm (p < 0.001). NGF also decreased the steady-state pHi reached after addition of Na+ to the bath solution (7.33 ± 0.08 without NGF (n = 4) versus 6.99 ± 0.03 with NGF (n = 5); p < 0.005). 2In our analysis, the pHi range over which Na+/H+ exchange activities are measured is bracketed on the low end by the pHi reached after bilateral Na+ replacement and on the high end by the pHiachieved after lumen or bath Na+ readdition (34Watts III, B.A. Good"
https://openalex.org/W1969364752,"The properties of recombinant staphylokinase (SakSTAR) expressed in Pichia pastoris cells have been determined. The single consensus N-linked oligosaccharide linkage site in SakSTAR (at Asn28 of the mature protein) was occupied in approximately 50% of the expressed protein with high-mannose-type oligosaccharides. The majority of these glycans ranged in polymerization state from Man8GlcNAc2to Man14GlcNAc2, with the predominant species being Man10GlcNAc2 and Man11GlcNAc2. Glycosylated SakSTAR (SakSTARg) did not differ from its aglycosyl form in its aggregation state in solution, its thermal denaturation properties, its ability to form a complex with human plasmin (hPm), the amidolytic properties of the respective SakSTAR-hPm complexes, or its ability to liberate the amino-terminal decapeptide required for formation of a functional SakSTAR-hPm plasminogen activator complex. However, this latter complex with SakSTARg showed a greatly reduced ability to activate human plasminogen (hPg) as compared with the same complex with the aglycosyl form of SakSTAR. We conclude that glycosylation at Asn28 does not affect the structural properties of SakSTAR or its ability to participate in the formation of an active enzymatic complex with hPm, but it is detrimental to the ability of the SakSTAR-hPm complex to serve as a hPg activator. This is likely due to restricted access of hPg to the active site of the SakSTARg-hPm complex.

The Sak gene has been cloned and sequenced from serotype B and F bacteriophagessakΦC (1Sako T. Sawaki S. Sakurai T. Ito S. Yoshizawa Y. Kondo I. Gen.

Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6: 226-231Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The protein was initially expressed in relatively low yield and with variable amino-terminal processing inEscherichia coli (1Sako T. Sawaki S. Sakurai T. Ito S. Yoshizawa Y. Kondo I. Gen.

Hyg. 1988; 269: 314-322PubMed Google Scholar), but later improvements in the expression plasmid provided much larger quantities of intact Sak (6Sako T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Schlott B. Hartmann M. Guhrs K.H. Birch-Hirschfeid E. Pohl H.D. Vanderschueren S. Van de Werf F. Michoel A. Collen D. Behnke D. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Some differences exist in the coding regions of the Sak genes in sakΦC,sak42D, and sakSTAR. Nonetheless, in each case, Sak is synthesized as a 163-amino acid protein that contains a 28-amino acid residue signal sequence. The x-ray crystallographic structure of SakSTAR has been determined, thus allowing a three-dimensional modeling of this protein (8Rabijns A. DeBondt H.L. DeRanter C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sak does not possess proteolytic activity. Thus, as with streptokinase (SK), the ability of Sak to convert hPg to hPm, a process that requires cleavage of the Arg561-Val562 peptide bond in hPg (9Robbins K.C. Summaria L. Hsieh B. Shah R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2333-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is indirect. However, unlike SK, Sak requires catalytic amounts of preformed hPm for this activation to occur (10Kowalska-Loth B. Zakrzewski K. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1975; 22: 327-339PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. De Coek F. Okada K. Ueshima S. Matsuo O. Collen D. J. Biol.

Blood. 1997; 89: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a feature that illustrates important differences in the mechanisms by which these two bacterial proteins activate hPg. Specifically, whereas the complex between SK and hPg is capable of self-generation of the enzymatic species SK-hPg′ and SK-hPm, both of which serve as hPg activators (for a review, see Ref. 14Castellino F.J. Urano T. deSerrano V. Morris J.P. Chibber B.A.K. Haemostasis. 1988; 18: 15-23PubMed Google Scholar), the Sak-hPg complex must be processed by another hPg activator to provide Sak-hPm, which then functions as a hPg activator complex. During the conversion of hPg to hPm by Sak, a decapeptide is cleaved from the amino terminus of Sak (1Sako T. Sawaki S. Sakurai T. Ito S. Yoshizawa Y. Kondo I. Gen. Genet. 1983; 190: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although this peptide cleavage is not a rate-limiting step in hPg activation (15Ueshima S. Okada K. Matsumoto H. Takaishi T. Fukao H. Matsuo O. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), it has been concluded that this event is necessary for this activation to occur (16Schlott B. Guhrs K.-H. Hartmann M. Rocker A. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6067-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interest in Sak is based on its ability to enhance fibrinolysis in a fibrin-dependent manner, thus holding promise for Sak as an agent for thrombolytic therapy (17Collen D. Van de Werf F. Circulation. 1993; 87: 1850-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Blood. 1994; 84: 680-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, elaboration of the essential properties of Sak required for hPg activation represents a timely area of investigation. In analysis of the amino acid sequence of SakSTAR, only one consensus site for N-linked glycosylation (Asn28-Val-Thr) is present. To test the importance of the occupancy of Asn28 by carbohydrate, which becomes a relevant issue for the expression of SakSTAR in systems other than bacteria, we examined the ability of this locus to be processed in a yeast-derived expression system and the effects of glycosylation on the properties of this protein. This communication presents the results of this study. The starting plasmid for this investigation was the E. coli expression plasmid pMEX602sakB (a gift from H. R. Lijnen, Leuven, Belgium), which contained the cDNA of SakSTAR isolated from a lysogenic S. aureus strain (4Collen D. Silence K. Demarsin E. De Mol M. Lijnen H.R. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6: 203-213Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that was cloned into the expression vector pMEX6 (7Schlott B. Hartmann M. Guhrs K.H. Birch-Hirschfeid E. Pohl H.D. Vanderschueren S. Van de Werf F. Michoel A. Collen D. Behnke D. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed to introduce restriction sites AvrII and NotI upstream and downstream of the SakSTAR cDNA, respectively, to allow insertion of this coding sequence cDNA into the Pichia pastoris expression plasmid pPIC9K (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To introduce the AvrII site (underlined), we used the primer TAC/CTAGGTCAAGTTCATTCGACAAAG(+), which codes for the mature amino-terminal sequence Ser1-Ser-Ser-Phe-Asp-Lys. The primer for the NotI site was ATGC/GGCCGCTTATTATTTCTTTTCTATAACAACC(−), a sequence that encodes the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein Val-Val-Ile-Glu-Lys-Lys136-Stop-Stop. PCR was carried out using Pfu polymerase (5.0 units) and the pMEX602sakB plasmid (100 ng). The primer annealing temperature was 47 °C. The PCR products were purified by electroelution and cloned into pPIC9K via its AvrII and NotI restriction sites. DH5α cells containing the pMEX602 intracellular expression plasmid were grown in 100 ml of Terrific Broth (Sigma Chemical Co.) at 37 °C with vigorous shaking in 500-ml culture flasks. Induction was accomplished during the late log phase with 200 mmisopropyl-β-thio-d-galactopyranoside for 4–8 h. Cells were centrifuged, and pellets were resuspended in 0.25 the volume of culture medium in 0.04 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and disrupted by pulsed sonication for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 30 min. The cleared lysates were diluted with H2O to 0.01m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. SakSTAR was then purified using minor modifications of a previously described method (7Schlott B. Hartmann M. Guhrs K.H. Birch-Hirschfeid E. Pohl H.D. Vanderschueren S. Van de Werf F. Michoel A. Collen D. Behnke D. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). First, the solution was purified by cation exchange chromatography over a 10-ml bed volume of SP-Sepharose at room temperature. The column was washed with 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and eluted with a 200-ml (total volume) linear gradient from 0 to 2.0m NaCl. The pooled fractions containing SakSTAR, as identified by an S2251 chromogenic substrate assay, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and TOF-MALDI-DE, were adjusted to 2.5m NaCl and applied to a 10-ml bed volume of phenyl-Sepharose. The column was washed with 0.01 m sodium phosphate and 2.5 m NaCl, pH 6.0, and eluted with 0.01m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. Fractions containing SakSTAR were identified as described above. The cDNA encoding SakSTAR was also expressed in the P. pastoris yeast system using the GS-115 strain. Detailed procedures used in this laboratory to select appropriate yeast transformants have been published previously (19Nilsen S.L. DeFord M.E. Prorok M. Chibber B.A.K. Bretthauer R.K. Castellino F.J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 25: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After transformation and selection of the high producing clones, the cells were grown to a cell density of 250 g/liter in a 5-liter fermentor using glycerol as the primary carbon source, after which methanol was added, and the cells were allowed to ferment for 8–12 h to induce extracellular production of SakSTAR. The medium was then collected and dialyzed against two changes of H2O to remove the high quantity of salt contained in the fermentor medium and, finally, against two changes of 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. SakSTAR was then purified in a two-step procedure as described above for theE. coli expression system. Fractions contained both SakSTARu and SakSTARg. To separate these unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of the protein, the solution was dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mmMgCl2, and 400 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and purified by affinity chromatography over a 10-ml bed volume of concanavalin A-Sepharose (Sigma Chemical Co.) at room temperature. SakSTARu was collected in the flow-through and wash. SakSTARg was then eluted from the column with 500 mm α-d-mannopyranoside in 10 mmsodium phosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, and 400 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. When SakSTARg was to be used for carbohydrate analysis, elution from the concanavalin A-Sepharose column was accomplished using 1 m acetic acid to avoid any possible contamination with mannose. However, in this case, further purification was necessary. The SakSTARg preparation was dialyzed against H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and injected onto a 4.6 × 150-mm C8 reverse phase HPLC column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) that was preequilibrated with a 75:25 (v:v) H2O:CH3CN solution containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was accomplished by increasing the CH3CN to 75% over 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The major peak that eluted at 19.5 min contained highly purified SakSTARg. To determine the plasminogen activator activity of SakSTAR, SakSTARu, and SakSTARg, the conversion of hPg to hPm was monitored using a coupled assay. An amount of 5 nm SakSTAR, SakSTARu, or SakSTARg was added to 5 nm hPg that contained endogenous trace amounts of hPm. The chromogenic substrate, S2251, was added to a final concentration of 0.9 mm. Release of p-nitroanilide was monitored continually at 405 nm for 1 h at 37 °C. The rate of activation of hPg by the SakSTAR variants was determined by the increase in absorbance at 405 nm as a function of time. The buffer used was 10 mm Na-Hepes and 150 mm NaOAc, pH 7.4. To examine the activity of the preformed SakSTAR-hPm complexes, the appropriate SakSTAR samples were added to hPm at a 1:1 molar stoichiometry. Urokinase was used to activate hPg before the addition of SakSTAR (0.5 nm urokinase and 13.5 μm hPg for 1 h at 37 °C). The activated hPm was then incubated with SakSTAR, SakSTARu, or SakSTARg at 37 °C to form the corresponding complex, respectively. Catalytic amounts (1:30, m:m) of these enzyme complexes were then added to 25 nm hPg in activation buffer containing the substrate. The continuous activation assay was carried out as indicated above. In separate experiments to determine the amidolytic activities of these same complexes, substrate S2251 was used without the addition of hPg. SakSTAR samples were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and adjusted to an adsorption range of 0.75–1.2 at 280 nm. The absorption spectra and the interference fringe pattern were measured on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with integrated absorbance and Rayleigh interference optics. A synthetic boundary cell was used with a path length of 1.2 cm. The volumes of the buffer reference and SakSTAR samples were 400 and 190 μl, respectively. Measurements were made at a rotor speed of 20,000 rpm at 20 °C with a detection wavelength of 280 nm for absorbance and 675 nm for fringe displacement. The fringe displacement (ΔJ) was determined by subtracting the mean value of the baseline from the plateau. The concentration (C) of the protein sample was then related to the fringe displacement by C = ΔJ/k, where k is the specific fringe displacement for a cell optical path length (L), defined ask = (dn/dc)L/λ. The specific refractive increment, dn/dc, was 0.187 (g/ml)−1at the wavelength (λ) of the laser light source (675 nm), a value that is generally accepted to be independent of the amino acid composition of the protein. Samples of SakSTAR, SakSTARu, or SakSTARg were dialyzed overnight against PBS buffer (0.01 m sodium phosphate and 0.14m NaCl, pH 7.4). Protein concentrations of 0.75–1.3 mg/ml of SakSTAR, SakSTARu, or SakSTARg were determined at 280 nm using the experimentally determined molar extinction coefficient of 9,800. Protein samples and buffers were degassed for 30 min. All SakSTAR samples were heated at 1 °C/min, and the denaturation temperatures (Tm) and calorimetric enthalpies (ΔH) for each protein were determined from computer analysis (with manufacturer-designed software) of the thermograms. CD spectra were recorded at 222 nm on an AVIV model 62DS spectrophotometer. SakSTAR, SakSTARu, or SakSTARg was dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4, and concentrated to 0.2 mg/ml. A 0.2-cm path length cell was used. The data were collected at a 1.0-nm bandwidth, and each represents the average of three measurements. The SakSTAR samples were heated at 1 °C/min, and changes in ellipticity were monitored at 222 nm. Mean residue ellipticities were calculated using a mean residue molecular weight of 114.6 for SakSTAR (20Gase A. Birchhirschfeld E. Guhrs K.H. Hartmann M. Vetterman S. Damaschun G. Damaschun H. Gast K. Misselwitz R. Zirwer D. Collen D. Schlott B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Points were fitted to a Boltzman curve, and midpoints were established as Tm values. A constant concentration of hPm (50 nm) was placed in individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate, and the plates were washed with PBS buffer after an overnight incubation at 4 °C. A 2-h incubation with blocking buffer (6% milk in PBS buffer) was followed by washings with PBS buffer. SakSTAR, SakSTARu, or SakSTARg was then added to the wells at a series of concentrations between 0 and 100 nm. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed once again as described above. A mouse anti-SakSTAR IgG monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml; obtained from H. R. Lijnen) was then incubated in the wells, and the wells were washed after 90 min. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) was then added to the wells and allowed to incubate for 90 min. After washing, the substrate Sigma-104 (Sigma Chemical Co.) was added, and the absorbancies of the wells were determined at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader to detect the amount of alkaline phosphatase present. After subtraction of the values determined for light scatter (absorbancy at 490 nm), plots were fitted to a hyperbolic curve, and C50 values were determined from the midpoints using Origin software. Control experiments demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody reacted with equal affinity to the three forms of SakSTAR. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge at speeds of 18,000, 20,000, and 25,0000 rpm with protein concentrations of 0.33, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/ml. Before centrifugation, the protein solutions were equilibrated in 10 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.3, at 20 °C. Dialysates were loaded into the reference chambers for all experiments. The apparent molecular weights and deviations from a single fit as functions of the radius from the center of rotation were determined using the Beckman XL-I software that accompanied the instrument. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using phosphoramidite-based methodology on the Beckman Oligo 1000M DNA synthesizer. For DNA sequencing, the dideoxy chain termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using the sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) was used with the ALFexpress sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Fluorescence labeling was accomplished with Cyp5′-dATP. All reagents for this procedure were purchased from Pharmacia. The sequencing gel was run at 1500 V, 60 mA, and 25 W at 55 °C. The laser power was stabilized between 700 and 800. The sequence was processed using software supplied by Pharmacia. The SakSTAR variants were identified in part based on their molecular weight by TOF-MALDI-DE on a Voyager-DE Spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framington, MA). The samples were dialyzed against H2O to remove any residual salts, after which they were concentrated to 0.1–1.0 mg/ml. A volume of 0.5 μl of sample was added to 0.5 μl of 10 mg/ml sinapinic acid in a mixture of 50:50 (v:v) H2O:CH3CN containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on a 100-well sample plate. The drops were air dried. The dried samples were irradiated with a N2 laser (337 nm; pulse time, 4 ns). Linear mode positive ionizations were used. Signal transients were recorded at a time resolution of 5 ns. For determination of the molecular weights of SakSTAR variants in the stoichiometric complex with hPm, the SakSTAR preparation was incubated at a 1:1 (m/m) complex with hPm for 40 min in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, and 400 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The reaction mixtures were then dialyzed overnight against H2O at 4 °C. The molecular weights of the SakSTAR samples in the presence and absence of hPm were determined by TOF-MALDI-DE in the positive ion mode as described above. Oligosaccharides were released from SakSTARg by digestion with PNGase F. The conditions of digestion were 1 unit PNGase F/200 μg SakSTARg in a total volume of 50 μl of a buffer containing 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, for 18 h at 37 °C. Hydrazinolysis was also employed using Oxford GlycoSystems (Rosedale, NY) Glycoprep 1000 for automated performance with 1 mg of SakSTARg in the cell. The released oligosaccharides were then labeled with 2-aminobenzamide (22Miele R.G. Nilsen S.L. Brito T. Bretthauer R.K. Castellino F.J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 25: 151-157PubMed Google Scholar, 23Miele R.G. Castellino F.J. Bretthauer R.K. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 26: 79-83PubMed Google Scholar). Methodology used for characterization of the fluorescence-labeled oligosaccharides by HPLC and by gel filtration using the Oxford GlycoSystems RAM 2000 GlycoSequencer has been described previously (22Miele R.G. Nilsen S.L. Brito T. Bretthauer R.K. Castellino F.J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 25: 151-157PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant SakSTAR was purified from conditioned culture media obtained from an E. coli-based expression system using a combination of SP-Sepharose (Fig.1 A) and phenyl-Sepharose (Fig.1 B) chromatography in quantities of approximately 300–400 mg/liter cell culture. As determined by TOF-MALDI-DE, the final material possessed a molecular weight of 15498.9 (calculated molecular weight, 15494.6), and the amino-terminal amino acid sequence was found to be Ser-Ser-Ser-Phe-Asp-Lys. Recombinant SakSTAR, purified as described in the Fig. 1 legend from P. pastoris cells, contained both the glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms, which were readily separated on a column of concanavalin A (Fig. 1 C). The final yields were approximately 60 mg/liter SakSTARuand 50 mg/liter SakSTARg. The molecular weight of SakSTARu, which was 15,497.3 (calculated molecular weight, 15,494.6), was very similar to that of SakSTAR, whereas that of SakSTARg was displayed as a heterogeneous broad peak approximately 3000 higher. Both forms of SakSTAR resulting from yeast expression possessed the same amino-terminal amino acid sequence as the material obtained from E. coli. A determination was made of the nature of the N-linked glycosylation at the lone consensus Asn site contained on Asn28 of SakSTARg. After release of theN-linked oligosaccharides by PNGase F, the glycan pool was fluorescence-labeled, and the components were identified in terms of their equivalent glucose units based on their elution positions from a calibrated BioGel P4 column (Fig. 2). The elution profile of the sample shows the presence of Man8–14GlcNAc2. Man10GlcNAc2 and Man11GlcNAc2 were present in approximately equal amounts and represented >80% of the oligosaccharides that were released from SakSTARg. When hydrazinolysis was used as the method for release of N-linked and O-linked saccharides, an elution profile very similar to that seen in Fig. 2 was obtained. Further treatment of the entire neutral oligosaccharide pool of Fig. 1with jack bean α-mannosidase followed by rechromatography on the BioGel P4 column resulted in the identification of a single fraction of the Man(β1,4)GlcNAc(β1,4)GlcNAc core. To assess the comparative properties of SakSTARu and SakSTARg, their thermal stabilities were determined. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis (Fig.3) yielded Tm values of 71.7 °C for SakSTARu and 71.8 °C for SakSTARg, with calorimetric enthalpies of 80.3 and 84.8 kcal/mol, respectively. These are similar to a Tm value of 70.0 °C and an enthalpy of 83.1 kcal/mol obtained for SakSTAR (data not shown). Comparable Tm values for SakSTAR, SakSTARu, and SakSTARg of 72.3 °C, 73.2 °C, and 76.0 °C, respectively, were obtained by monitoring the temperature dependence of their molar ellipticities at 222 nm (data not shown). Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation analyses of each of the SakSTAR samples were undertaken to examine whether aggregation of the polypeptide chain occurred. The graphs provided (Fig.4) show that the data for both proteins could be fit to single molecular weights over a wide concentration range in the cell. This is supported by the randomness of the residuals also provided in Fig. 4. The apparent molecular weights determined from this approach were 15,994 ± 214 for SakSTARu and 18,241 ± 347 for SakSTARg. These compare very closely with the calculated molecular weights for the monomeric species. Similar data were collected for bacterially expressed SakSTAR. The overall abilities of the various forms of SakSTAR to activate hPg were assessed in an assay wherein the various forms of SakSTAR were added to hPg in a continuous assay of plasmin formation. Formation of the SakSTAR-hPm activator complex occurred due to the presence of small amounts of hPm that are present in the hPg preparations. Under identical activation conditions, the results illustrated in Fig.5 A demonstrated that whereas SakSTARu displayed a high level of hPg activator activity under these conditions, SakSTARg did not generate an effective hPg activator complex with hPm. On the other hand, the data in Fig. 5 B demonstrate that the addition of equimolar levels to preformed hPm did not inhibit the amidolytic activity of hPm toward S2251. However, Fig. 5 C shows that the ability of a preformed SakSTARg-hPm complex to activate hPg is significantly diminished. The ability of the SakSTAR proteins to associate with hPm was determined from the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding experiments shown in Fig. 6. The data demonstrate that all three forms of the protein interact in a nearly identical manner to hPm, with C50 values of 16, 21, and 22 nm for SakSTAR, SakSTARu, and SakSTARg, respectively. These experiments were performed by titration of hPm with the SakSTAR variants. When similar titrations of insolubilized SakSTAR preparations were conducted with hPm (the complex was detected with a hPg-derived monoclonal antibody), the C50 values were nearly the same (∼1.5-fold higher in each case) as those reported above. Lastly, because amino-terminal proteolysis (at Lys10-Lys11) of Sak has been shown to be necessary for hPg activation to occur (3Collen D. Zhao Z.A. Holvoet P. Marynen P. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6: 226-231Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Sako T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the amino-terminal amino acid sequences of these forms of SakSTAR were determined after complexation with hPm. After incubation of equimolar amounts of each form of SakSTAR with hPm for 20 min at 37 °C, the samples were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The band containing the relevant SakSTAR was excised, and the amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed. For all three samples, the sequence (>90%) obtained was Lys11-Gly-Asp-Asp-Ala-Ser. Further confirmation that this critical cleavage of SakSTAR occurs in the SakSTAR-hPm complex was achieved using TOF-MALDI-DE analysis. The SakSTARu and SakSTARg complexes displayed molecular mass differences of 1164 and 1203, respectively, from their parent proteins in the presence of hPm. These values (or their Na+ adducts) are consistent with the loss of a decameric peptide from the amino terminus of SakSTAR (calculated molecular weight, 1170.6). SakSTAR contains a single N-linked oligosaccharide consensus site at Asn28. This investigation was initiated to ascertain the effects on the activity of this protein consequent to glycan occupancy of that site. In its natural state in S. aureus, the relevant Asn28 is not glycosylated, but in expression systems other than bacteria, this residue is potentially capable of assembling oligosaccharide. A full understanding of whether this residue can be modified in the conformational environment of the intact protein and how processing at this site in other host cells affects its properties is relevant to the elucidation of the structure-function relationships of SakSTAR. An additional consideration concerns the extent to which SakSTAR activity is altered by glycosylation in expression systems that could be effectively utilized for its preparation. This is especially pertinent if large amounts of material would be required for use as a therapeutic fibrinolytic agent. We used yeast cells of the strain P. pastoris as an expression system to express SakSTAR. The choice of this expression vehicle was governed by the potentially large amounts of secreted protein that could be obtained in a simple and inexpensive culture medium under simple fermentation conditions with methanol/glycerol as the only carbon sources. Furthermore, when compared with the much more extensively characterized Saccharomyces cerevisiae system, the glycosylation machinery of P. pastoris cells only permits assembly of relatively short N-linked high-mannose saccharides (22Miele R.G. Nilsen S.L. Brito T. Bretthauer R.K. Castellino F.J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 25: 151-157PubMed Google Scholar), a subpopulation of which may be phosphorylated (23Miele R.G. Castellino F.J. Bretthauer R.K. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 26: 79-83PubMed Google Scholar). O-linked glycans with a small number of mannose residues consisting of mannose and (α1,2)-linked dimer to pentamer saccharides of mannose have also been observed (24Duman J.G. Miele R.G. Liang H. Grella D.K. Sim K.L. Castellino F.J. Bretthauer R.K. Biotech. Appl. Biochem. 1998; 28: 39-45PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of SakSTAR from 3 liters of fermentation medium ofP. pastoris cells using an expression plasmid that allows for secretion of the protein results in total final yields of approximately 100–150 mg of the recombinant material. The relative amount of protein that contains N-linked glycans ranges from 50% to 75% of the total, which varies in different fermentations. We have not performed a systematic study of the routine variables in the fermentation protocol that affect the extent of protein modification. The purified glycosylated and aglycosylated proteins were subjected to molecular weight analysis by TOF-MALDI-DE and amino-terminal acid sequence analysis. Both analyses indicated that signal peptide processing was identical for SakSTARu and SakSTARg and yielded the same mature protein as that obtained for bacterially expressed SakSTAR. Neither SakSTARu nor SakSTARg displays association or concentration-dependent aggregation in solution as demonstrated by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. Thus, both yeast-expressed proteins exist as single chain molecules in solution. The nature of the Asn28-linked oligosaccharides assembled on SakSTARg by P. pastoris cells was similar to that found earlier for another peptide expressed in this system (22Miele R.G. Nilsen S.L. Brito T. Bretthauer R.K. Castellino F.J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 25: 151-157PubMed Google Scholar). Man10GlcNAc2 and Man11GlcNAc2 represented approximately 80% of the total glycans released from Asn28. Exoglycosidase-catalyzed digestion of the entire oligosaccharide pool with an α-mannose-specific jack bean mannosidase showed that all mannose residues except the single core mannose possessed α-anomeric linkages. Digestion of this same oligosaccharide pool with (α1,2)-specific mannosidase yielded a single product, Man6GlcNAc2. This conclusion is consistent with previous results showing that the P. pastoris-derived core glycan structure contains an additional (α1,6)-mannose on the arm of the (α1,3)-mannose of the mammalian-type core oligosaccharide Man5GlcNAc2, with mannose extensions from this latter yeast-based core structure of the (α1,2)-type (22Miele R.G. Nilsen S.L. Brito T. Bretthauer R.K. Castellino F.J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 25: 151-157PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the HPLC profiles of N-linked oligosaccharides and on the lack of additional saccharide release by hydrazinolysis from SakSTARg after liberation of N-linked glycans by PNGase F, no evidence was obtained for charged N-linked oligosaccharides or O-linked saccharides, respectively, on SakSTARg. Thus, all carbohydrate chains assembled on this protein were Asn28-linked neutral high-mannose oligosaccharides with yeast-type mannose extensions from the mammalian-like core. To assess the conformational stability of the protein, thermal stability measurements were carried out by two independent techniques. From both differential scanning calorimetry analysis and CD-monitored temperature scans, Tm values between 70 °C and 76 °C were obtained for SakSTAR, SakSTARu, and SakSTARg. These high Tm values suggest that the native conformation is highly resistant to thermal denaturation. This property is displayed despite the lack of added stability that would be present if the protein contained disulfide bonds. Furthermore, the presence of the glycan does not significantly alter the conformational stability of SakSTAR. This conclusion also suggests that interactions between the protein and the oligosaccharide chain, if any, have minimal impact on the maintenance of stability in SakSTARg. Measurements of the comparative abilities of the P. pastoris-derived SakSTAR preparations to activate hPg were made. When added to identical preparations of hPg that contained a small amount of hPm, it was found that whereas SakSTARu possessed the capacity to activate hPg, SakSTARg was nearly inactive under these conditions (Fig. 5 A). This result then prompted additional experiments designed to address the basis for these differential effects. The first set of experiments was intended to address the question of whether the oligosaccharides present on SakSTARg could have precluded the formation of the SakSTAR-hPm activator complex. The data in Fig. 6 demonstrate that this is not the case, and complexes of nearly equal affinity were formed between hPm and each form of SakSTAR. It has been found that release of a decapeptide from the amino terminus of SakSTAR, consequent to cleavage at Lys10-Lys11, is required for generation of an effective SakSTAR-hPm activator complex (3Collen D. Zhao Z.A. Holvoet P. Marynen P. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6: 226-231Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Sako T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We then examined the possibility that the presence of the carbohydrate at Asn28is affecting plasmin-mediated processing of SakSTAR to its fully active low molecular weight form. This was determined through incubation of both SakSTAR forms with hPm followed by electrophoretic separation. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the excised gel band corresponding to SakSTARg showed a clear sequence, beginning at Lys10. This indicates that the requisite peptide bond in SakSTARg was cleaved in the complex, thus potentially rendering the complex capable of displaying hPg activation activity. The possibility that the oligosaccharides present on SakSTARg could have blocked the active site of hPm, thus inhibiting the activity of the SakSTARg-hPm complex, was eliminated based on the experiments in Fig. 5 B. Here, it is seen that the addition of an equimolar level of SakSTARg to hPm had little effect on the amidolytic activity of this enzyme toward the small substrate, S2251. However, upon activation of hPg with catalytic levels of preformed complexes of SakSTARu-hPm and SakSTARg-hPm (Fig. 6 C), a clear diminution of SakSTARg-hPm activity, similar to that of hPm alone, is observed. Thus, we conclude that the basis of the poor hPg activator activity of SakSTARg results from the loss of specificity of the SakSTARg-hPm complex for hPg, perhaps due to a more restricted access of hPg to the active site of hPm in the activator complex. Examination of a recently reported x-ray crystallographic structure of a ternary microplasmin-SakSTAR-microplasmin complex wherein an activating complex of SakSTAR and microplasmin is bound to a second substrate-like molecule of microplasmin (25Parry M.A.A. Fernandez-Catalan C. Bergner A. Huber R. Hopfner K.-P. Schlott B. Guhrs K.-H. Bode W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) reveals that a Met residue at position 26 of SakSTAR is part of a hydrophobic network having surface complementarity to the carboxyl-terminal region of the microplasmin. This Met residue has been shown to be critical for the efficient activation of hPg by SakSTAR (26Schlott B. Hartmann M. Guhrs K.H. Birchhirschfeld E. Gase A. Vettermann S. Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and lies in close proximity to Asn28. The results displayed in Fig. 6 demonstrate that no appreciable decrease in hPm binding affinity is associated with glycosylation of SakSTAR. This observation strongly suggests that the presence of the oligosaccharide moiety on Asn28 is not interfering with the docking of the microplasmin moiety. However, a subtle change in orientation of hPm at the SakSTARginterface may be occurring, which can then restrict access of the activation loop of the hPg substrate to its requisite subsites in the active site cleft. The active site entry and proper orientation of a smaller substrate is not affected in the SakSTARg-hPm complex. In conclusion, this investigation has provided clear evidence that glycosylation of the lone N-linked consensus site in SakSTAR is detrimental to its hPg activator activity and has revealed the mechanism of this effect. As such, this study provides valuable contributions to understanding the structure-function relationships of this protein. In addition, whereas oligosaccharides assembled on SakSTAR other than those identified herein may not produce these same effects, this work should serve to heighten awareness that processing events of this protein in other systems may not yield fully functional protein."
https://openalex.org/W2020060046,"Previous studies have shown that the lack of novel coactivator activity in mouse oocytes and one-cell embryos (fertilized eggs) renders them incapable of utilizing Gal4:VP16-dependent enhancers (distal elements) but not promoters (proximal elements) in regulating transcription. This coactivator activity first appears in two- to four-cell embryos coincident with the major activation of zygotic gene expression. Here we show that whereas oocytes and fertilized eggs could utilize Sp1-dependent promoters, they could not utilize Sp1-dependent enhancers, although they showed promoter repression, which is a requirement for delineating enhancer function. In contrast, both Sp1-dependent promoters and enhancers were functional in two- to four-cell embryos. Furthermore, the same embryonic stem cell mRNA that provided the coactivator activity for Gal4:VP16-dependent enhancer function also provided Sp1-dependent enhancer function in oocytes. Therefore, the coactivator activity appears to be a requirement for general enhancer function. To determine whether the absence of enhancer function is a unique property of oocytes or a general property of other terminally differentiated cells, transcription was examined in terminally differentiated hNT neurons and their precursors, undifferentiated NT2 stem cells. The results showed that both cell types could utilize enhancers and promoters. Thus, in mammals, the lack of enhancer function appears to be unique to oocytes and fertilized eggs, suggesting that it provides a safeguard against premature activation of genes prior to zygotic gene expression during development.

Biol. 1998; 8: R422-R424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enhancers can also function in stimulating DNA replication (11DePamphilis M.L. Cell. 1988; 52: 635-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 12DePamphilis M.L. Methods. 1997; 13: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Kobayashi T. Rein T.

However, it is not clear how transcriptional enhancers regulate the development of a one cell embryo (fertilized egg) into an animal. This is primarily due to the lack of availability of sufficient number of embryos to carry out biochemical studies. Only recently techniques have been developed that allow the study of transcription and replication in mammalian oocytes, embryos as early as a fertilized egg, and even a single embryo using microinjection techniques (14Majumder S. DePamphilis M.L. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Majumder S. Zhao Z. Kaneko K. DePamphilis M.L.

Boulikas Gene Therapy and Molecular Biology. Gene Therapy Press, Palo Alto1998Google Scholar). Such techniques have shown that DNA replication and transcription from the injected DNA are carried out in mammalian system only when appropriate eukaryotic regulatory sequences and competent cell types are present. For example, expression of genes from microinjected plasmids in mammalian oocytes and embryos requires the presence of valid promoter elements. Likewise, expression of genes from plasmids injected into morphologically arrested fertilized eggs begins only 40 h after fertilization, when the expression of genes from the embryonic genome also begins (see below). This suggests that gene expression from injected plasmids is under the same control as that from the embryonic genome. Furthermore, the injected embryos can be transplanted into the womb of a pseudopregnant female mouse, where they develop into mice (19Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Therefore, results obtained with the microinjection system are not an artifact of the experimental protocol and provide an opportunity to study transcriptional regulation, including enhancer function, in the context of a living animal.In sexually mature female mice, oocytes undergo the first meiotic reductive division to become mature unfertilized eggs. These eggs when fertilized by sperm go through the second meiotic division to produce a fertilized egg containing both a paternal and maternal haploid pronucleus. Each pronucleus undergoes DNA replication; they then fuse together during the first mitosis to generate a two-cell embryo containing one zygotic diploid nucleus per cell. The major transcription of zygotic genes begins about 40 h after fertilization, which corresponds to the two-cell stage of normal development. However, in morphologically arrested fertilized eggs, the major gene expression begins at the same time. Thus, this function appears to be regulated by a time-dependent biological clock (zygotic clock) (14Majumder S. DePamphilis M.L. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Kaneko K.J. DePamphilis M.L. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Schultz G.A. Heyner S.

In all of these embryos, minor transcription of genes occurs during the late one-cell stage (22Conover J.C. Temeles G.L. Zimmermann J.W. Burke B. Schultz R.M. Dev.

Prior to that stage, survival of the embryos is continuously regulated by the translation of maternally inherited mRNA present in mature and fertilized eggs (31Xu W. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Mol.

Reprod. 1998; 59: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).By using the microinjection system, it has been found that although transcription can be regulated from the proximal promoter site in oocytes, fertilized eggs, and two-cell embryos, it cannot be regulated from the distal enhancer sites prior to the formation of a two-cell embryo (15Majumder S. Zhao Z. Kaneko K. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1721-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Kaneko K.J. DePamphilis M.L. Dev.

Previously, we observed that the exogenous transcription factor Gal4:VP16 can stimulate transcription from the proximal promoter site but not from the distal enhancer site in terminally differentiated mouse oocytes or maternal and paternal pronuclei of fertilized eggs. In contrast, Gal4:VP16 was found to stimulate transcription from both promoter and enhancer sites in undifferentiated two- to four-cell mouse embryos (15Majumder S. Zhao Z. Kaneko K. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1721-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41Majumder S. Miranda M. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A lack of enhancer activity in the paternal pronuclei of fertilized eggs was found to be caused by the absence of chromatin-mediated promoter repression, a prerequisite for delineating enhancer function (25Nothias J.Y. Miranda M. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5715-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Wiekowski M. Miranda M. Nothias J.Y. Turner B.M. DePamphilis M.L. J.

Dev. 1997; 47: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the lack of enhancer activity in oocytes and the maternal pronuclei of fertilized eggs was found to be caused not by the absence of chromatin repression or functional enhancer activation protein (Gal4:VP16) but rather by the absence of enhancer-specific coactivator activity. This coactivator activity first appears in two-cell mouse embryos during development concurrent with the major onset of zygotic gene expression (ZGE)1 (15Majumder S. Zhao Z. Kaneko K. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1721-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the coactivator activity missing in oocytes could be provided to oocytes by microinjection of mRNA obtained from undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells. This mRNA had no effect in two- to four-cell embryos presumably because of its presence in these cells at saturating levels (15Majumder S. Zhao Z. Kaneko K. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1721-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).To determine whether the lack of the enhancer-specific coactivator activity in oocytes and the maternal pronuclei of fertilized eggs was responsible for the inability of these cells to use enhancers driven by transcription factors other than those containing the acidic activation domains, like Gal4:VP16, here we examined Sp1-dependent promoter and enhancer function in these cell types and control two- to four-cell embryos. Sp1 is a transcription factor that contains a glutamine-rich activation domain. We found that, just like with Gal4:VP16, oocytes and the maternal pronuclei of fertilized eggs can use Sp1-dependent promoters but not Sp1-dependent enhancers. In contrast, Sp1-dependent promoters and enhancers were both active in two- to four-cell embryos. Furthermore, the same ES cell mRNA that provided the missing coactivator activity for Gal4:VP16-dependent enhancer function also provided Sp1-dependent enhancer function in oocytes. Thus, enhancer-specific coactivator activity, which is absent prior to the formation of a two-cell embryo, is a requirement for general enhancer function. In addition, to determine whether the absence of the enhancer function is a general property of terminally differentiated cells or is only limited to oocytes, we examined both Gal4:VP16- and Sp1-dependent promoter and enhancer activity in terminally differentiated hNT neurons and their precursors, NT2 neuronal stem cells. NT2 cells can be differentiated into mature hNT neurons in the presence of retinoic acid under well established cell culture conditions; both hNT neurons and NT2 cells have been extensively characterized (47Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). We found that both hNT neurons and NT2 cells used Gal4:VP16- and Sp1-dependent promoters and enhancers. Thus, in mammals, the absence of the enhancer-specific coactivator, and therefore the inability to use enhancers, appears to be unique to oocytes and fertilized eggs prior to ZGE.DISCUSSIONWe drew two conclusions from our present studies of gene expression in mammalian system, namely terminally differentiated oocytes, fertilized eggs, and two- to four-cell embryos on one hand and terminally differentiated hNT neurons and their precursor, NT2 stem cells on the other. First, the enhancer-specific coactivator activity is required for enhancers driven by both Gal4:VP16 (acidic activation domain) and Sp1 (glutamine-rich activation domain), suggesting that the coactivator activity is a requirement for general enhancer function. Second, the lack of coactivator activity, and therefore enhancer function, is unique to oocytes and fertilized eggs. This coactivator activity first appears in two- to four-cell embryos, suggesting that this mechanism provides a safeguard against premature activation of zygotic genes prior to ZGE. Various aspects of enhancer function during mouse embryonic development are discussed below.Lack of Enhancer-specific Coactivator Activity in Terminally Differentiated Mouse OocytesMulticellular organisms, as opposed to their unicellular counterparts, face a unique problem in carrying out life-sustaining functions. Whereas in unicellular organisms the same cell performs all the necessary functions, in multicellular organisms there is a division of labor: specific cell types carry out specific functions in a spatial and temporal manner. During the mammalian life cycle, multipotent progenitor stem cells undergo differentiation at various levels, eventually giving rise to specific cell types. Whereas the stem cells maintain the potential for cell division, giving rise to either their own kind or a differentiated form, the terminally differentiated cells lose such potential. In fact, oocytes and neurons are two examples of terminally differentiated cell types that lose the ability to undergo division completely. Although these non-dividing cells are presumed to perform restricted tasks, the strategies they adopt to regulate transcription is unknown. In the present study, we used differentiated oocytes and undifferentiated two- to four-cell embryos to examine such strategies and to compare them with undifferentiated neuronal NT2 stem cells and differentiated hNT neurons.Previously, we found that transcription in mouse oocytes is regulated by an exogenously added Gal4:VP16-dependent promoter activity but not Gal4:VP16-dependent enhancer activity. In contrast, both promoter and enhancer activity were observed in two- to four-cell embryos. Enhancers are believed to stimulate promoters by relieving chromatin-mediated repression. However, the lack of enhancer-mediated transcription in oocytes, as compared with two- to four-cell embryos, was found to be caused not by the absence of promoter repression or functional enhancer activation protein. Accordingly, the efficiency of chromatin assembly on the microinjected DNA in mouse oocytes and two-cell embryos by assaying the degree of superhelicity was found to be equal in these cell types (∼70%) (39Martinez-Salas E. Linney E. Hassell J. DePamphilis M.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1493-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,65Chalifour L.E. Wirak D.O. Wassarman P.M. DePamphilis M.L. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 619-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this degree of chromosome assembly on the microinjected plasmid DNA was found to correlate directly with the level of repression of promoters present on these plasmids. The repression could be relieved in both oocytes and two- to four-cell embryos by histone deacetylase inhibitors like sodium butyrate or trichostatin A (41Majumder S. Miranda M. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 42Wiekowski M. Miranda M. DePamphilis M.L. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 366-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 51Wiekowski M. Miranda M. DePamphilis M.L. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 66Worrad D.M. Turner B.M. Schultz R.M. Development. 1995; 121: 2949-2959PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the lack of enhancer function was found to be caused by the absence of an enhancer-specific coactivator activity. The missing coactivator activity could be supplied to oocytes by microinjection of mRNA from undifferentiated ES cells (15Majumder S. Zhao Z. Kaneko K. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1721-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the question of whether the coactivator activity is also required for enhancers regulated by transcription factors other than those containing an acidic activation domain like Gal4:VP16. This was determined by testing the endogenously present Sp1-dependent promoter and enhancer activity in oocytes. We found that oocytes show Sp1-dependent promoter activity but not Sp1-dependent enhancer activity, suggesting that the coactivator activity is a general requirement for enhancers driven by various classes of transcription factors.To determine if the lack of enhancer-mediated transcription is a general phenomenon of terminal differentiation, we further examined promoter- and enhancer-mediated transcription in NT2 stem cells and terminally differentiated hNT neurons. We found that both cell types are capable of promoter- and enhancer-mediated transcription. Therefore, neurons, but not oocytes, utilize enhancer-mediated transcription and provide evidence that different terminally differentiated cell types can regulate transcription using distinct strategies.Lack of Enhancer-specific Coactivator Activity in Fertilized Mouse Eggs Prior to ZGEAs mentioned above, the major expression of zygotic genes takes place about 40 h after fertilization and is regulated by a time-dependent zygotic clock. This mechanism presumably involves the destruction of an inhibitor or production of a functional activator of general transcription. What is the importance of the zygotic clock that delays the onset of embryonic transcription until a defined time after fertilization? The paternal genome in sperm comes with protamines, whereas the maternal genome in eggs comes with a normal complement of core histones (67Zirkin B.R. Perreault S.D. Schatten H. Shatten G. Molecular Biology of Fertilization. Academic Press, 1989: 91-114Google Scholar, 68Nonchev S. Tsanev R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1990; 25: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After fertilization, their genomes undergo chromatin remodeling to establish the zygotic genome at the two-cell stage. In the male pronuclei, this process of remodeling might generate DNA that is not complexed with either histones or protamines (69Rodman T.C. Pruslin F.H. Hoffmann H.P. Allfrey V.G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or might produce a chromatin state that exposes promoters to transcription factors. Thus, the zygotic clock may provide a mechanism to ensure no spurious transcription occurs during the remodeling period. On the other hand, after zygotic remodeling, the chromatin-mediated repression of most promoters in two-cell embryos may provide a mechanism for enhancer-mediated tissue-specific transcription of genes during development and growth. Delaying expression of the enhancer-specific coactivator prior to ZGE may provide an additional mechanism for preventing inappropriate transcription of genes during this critical period of development.The same mechanisms that regulate the beginning of ZGE during mouse embryonic development also seem to occur in other animals. In other mammals, transcription is delayed until the two-cell or 16-cell stage, presumably by the same zygotic clock mechanism. For example, ZGE begins at the two-cell stage in hamsters, the four-cell stage in pigs, the four- to eight-cell stage in humans, and the eight- to 16-cell stage in sheep, rabbits, and cows (21Schultz R.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 70Telford N.A. Watson A.J. Schultz G.A. Mol. Reprod.

Dev. 1992; 32: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Whether enhancer-specific coactivator activity appears during the two-cell stage of embryonic development in these mammals or is delayed until the same stage when zygotic transcription begins remains to be seen.Special Features of DNA Replication and Transcription at the Beginning of Mammalian DevelopmentOur present knowledge of the principles that regulate the early development of vertebrate embryos comes mainly from the Xenopus system (7Vermaak D. Wolffe A.P. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 72Vermaak D. Steinbach O.C. Dimitrov S. Rupp R.A.W. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 533-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the last few years, elegant experiments have uncovered clues in diverse areas from how DNA replication and chromatin structure affects gene expression to the role of post-transcriptional modification on the expression of maternal mRNAs (10Imhof A. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R422-R424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 73Wolffe A.P. Biochem. Soc.

Although similar in many respects, the mammalian system, as exemplified by the mouse development, appears to be mechanistically different fromXenopus in some other aspects. For example, InXenopus oocytes, the majority of RNA polymerase II transcripts frequently are initiated at incorrect sites (75Steinbeisser H. Hofmann A. Stutz F. Trendelenburg M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3223-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and transcriptional regulatory components that are required by cells at later stages in development are dispensable in oocytes (76Michaeli T. Prives C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1579-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 77Green J. Brady J. Khoury G. Virology. 1987; 159: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Even more striking is the fact that although bidirectional DNA replication is initiated at specific sites in the chromosomes of differentiated mammalian cells (11DePamphilis M.L. Cell. 1988; 52: 635-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 12DePamphilis M.L. Methods. 1997; 13: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 78DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), virtually any DNA injected into non-mammalian eggs undergoes semiconservative replication, and early embryos of amphibians and flies recognize at least 5 times more initiation sites than do differentiated cells from the same animals (79DePamphilis M.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Earlier studies showed that the activity of promoter/enhancer sequences injected into Xenopus eggs is generally delayed until the midblastula transition (MBT) (80Kimelman D. Kirschner M. Scherson T. Cell. 1987; 48: 399-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 81Shiokawa K. Misumi Y. Tashiro K. Nakakura N. Yamana K. Oh-uchida M. Cell Differ. Dev. 1989; 28: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), although they appear to exhibit a low but constant rate of gene expression per cell prior to the MBT (82Shiokawa K. Yamana K. Fu Y. Atsuchi Y. Hosokawa K. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1990; 198: 322-329Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the MBT in Xenopus development appeared to be equivalent to ZGE in the mouse. However, more recent studies showed that hormone-dependent transcriptional activation can be observed in Xenopus oocytes (83Wong J. Patterton D. Imhof A. Guschin D. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P.

https://openalex.org/W2029505327,"Activin, a member of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily, signals through a heteromeric complex of type I and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors. The two activin type I receptors previously identified, ALK-2 (ActR-I) and ALK-4 (ActR-IB), have distinct effects on gene expression, differentiation and morphogenesis in the <i>Xenopus</i> animal cap assay. ALK-4 reproduces the effects of activin treatment including the dose-dependent induction of progressively more dorso-anterior mesodermal and endodermal markers, whereas ALK-2 induces only ventral mesodermal markers and counteracts the effects of ALK-4. To identify regions of the receptors that determine signaling specificity we have generated chimeras of the constitutively active ALK-2 and ALK-4 receptors (termed ALK-2* and ALK-4*). The effects of these chimeric receptors on gene expression and morphogenetic movements implicate the loop between kinase subdomains IV and V in mediating the strong dorsal gene-inducing properties of ALK-4*; when the seven amino acids comprising this loop are transferred from ALK-4* to ALK-2*, the resulting chimeric receptor is capable of inducing the expression of dorsal-specific genes. In contrast, when the equivalent region of ALK-2* is transferred to the ALK-4* backbone it cannot effectively counteract the dorsalizing effects of ALK-4*, suggesting that other regions of type I receptors are also involved in determining signal specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2081940259,"Abstract The role of two essential residues at the N-terminal hook region of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) in nitric-oxide synthase activity was investigated. Full-length mouse nNOS proteins containing single-point mutations of Thr-315 and Asp-314 to alanine were produced in the Escherichia coli and baculovirus-insect cell expression systems. The molecular properties of the mutant proteins were analyzed in detail by biochemical, optical, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques and compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. Replacement of Asp-314 by Ala altered the geometry around the heme site and the substrate-binding pocket of the heme domain and abrogated the ability of nNOS to form catalytically active dimers. Replacement of Thr-315 by Ala reduced the protein stability and altered the geometry around the heme site, especially in the absence of bound (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin cofactor. These results suggest that Asp-314 and Thr-315 both play critical structural roles in stabilizing the heme domain and subunit interactions in mouse nNOS."

Here we showed that central regions from several p53ts mutants behaved similarly, i.e. they repressed a neighboring activation domain only when existing in the mutant status. Using chimeric protein GAL4VP16-CRts247 as an example, we demonstrated thatde novo protein synthesis was not required for the reactivation of the chimeric protein, indicating that a post-translational mechanism was involved in the control of CRts247 activity. The CRts247-conferred thermo-regulability did not work via a mechanism demanding either an alteration of the subcellular compartmentalization of or the inactivation of DNA-binding activity of the GAL4 chimera. Further, CRts247 did not function in trans, eliminating the possibility that the observed repression was because of the competition for a putative factor(s) by the mutant p53 domain. Rather, CRts247 bestowed temperature-dependent interaction with hTAFII32 to the VP16 activation domain. In a parallel experiment, CRts247 also caused a large reduction in the affinity of hTAFII32 to the p53 activation domain at the nonpermissive temperature.

Hinds P.W. Levine A.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1083-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Although the half-life of the p53 protein is quite short, in response to DNA damage the protein accumulates and turns on the expression of genes that are involved in growth arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis (2Canman C.E. Gilmer T.M. Coutts S.B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 3Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6757) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological activities of p53 are mainly attributed to its function as a transcription factor. In structure, the human p53 protein consists of 393 amino acids and is organized into three functional domains: an N-terminal region involved in transcriptional activation, a central region mediating specific DNA binding, and a C-terminal region responsible for oligomerization, transcriptional repression, and nonspecific DNA binding (4Prives C.

Biol. 1995; 15: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The natural forms of cancers almost universally contain mutations in the p53 gene. Mostly, they are single missense point mutations located within the central region, that is, approximately residues 100–300 of the p53 protein. These mutations not only lead to the inactivation of the tumor suppressor function of p53 but also transform p53 into an oncogene through a dominant negative effect (6Lane D.P. Benchimol S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that wild-type and mutant p53 proteins appear to exhibit distinctive phenotypes (7Cook A. Milner J. Br. J. Cancer. 1990; 61: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), and the two phenotypes represent distinctive conformations of the p53 polypeptide (7Cook A. Milner J. Br. J.

Biochemically, mutations in the central region of p53 typically result in the loss of the specific DNA-binding activity of the protein (4Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have previously demonstrated that the central region (CRts247)1encompassing residues 101–318 of p53N247I, a p53ts mutant with a substitution of isoleucine for asparagine at residue 247, functions as a movable and regulable inactivation cassette (10Chuang J.-Y.

It represses several activation domains present on the same polypeptide chain at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) but not at the permissive temperature (30 °C). These observations suggest that CRts247 has the potential to be used as a desirable tool for the construction of temperature-sensitive derivatives of transcription factors (10Chuang J.-Y. Lin C.-T.

Nevertheless, how the mutant p53 central region gives rise to the repression activity in general and how CRts247 confers thermo-regulability to a neighboring activation domain in particular remain largely unknown.

For temperature-sensitive assays, the incubation temperature was switched to 30 °C after a 12-h transfection at 37 °C. To block protein synthesis, cycloheximide was added to the medium to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. RNA preparation and primer extension were performed as described previously (18Lin Y.S.

Cells were fixed for 10 min with 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 36 h after transfection. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS, permeabilized for 10 min in a mixture containing an equal volume of acetone and ethanol at 4 °C, and then washed twice with PBS. For immunofluorescence, slides were first incubated with 10% normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. The slides were then incubated at room temperature for 12 h with the polyclonal anti-GAL4-(1–147) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted (1:1000) in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 0.05% sodium azide. The slides were washed twice for 10 min with PBS at room temperature and incubated for another 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Finally, the slides were washed extensively with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20 and mounted on a microscope. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and GST-hTAFII32 were expressed in and purified fromEscherichia coli XA90 strain according to standard protocols (18Lin Y.S. Green M.R.

The ligand concentration, using bovine serum albumin as a standard, was adjusted to approximately 0.125 mg per ml of resin for GST and GST-hTAFII32. The His-tagged GAL4VP16-CRwt, GAL4VP16-CRts247, p53-(1–318), and p53N247I-(1–318) were expressed in and purified fromE. coli JM109(DE3) strain according to the suggestions of the manufacturer (QIAGEN, Inc.). In vitro phosphorylation of the His-tagged proteins was performed as follows: 16 μg of the His-tagged protein were incubated with 8 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 units of heart muscle kinase (Sigma) in 60 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 12 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction sample was passed through a NucTrap column (Stratagene) to remove free [γ-32P]ATP. Aliquots (40 μl) of the GST protein beads were incubated for 2 h at either 30 °C or 37 °C as indicated in the figure legends with 2 μg of 32P-labeled GAL4 and p53 derivatives in 500 μl of a buffer (NETN buffer) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. After being washed five times with 1 ml of NETN buffer containing either 200 mmNaCl and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (for derivatives of GAL4VP16) or 500 mm NaCl and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 (for derivatives of p53) prewarmed to the indicated temperature, bound proteins were eluted from beads and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. We have shown that CRts247 represses a neighboring transactivation domain only at the nonpermissive temperature (10Chuang J.-Y. Lin C.-T. Wu C.-W. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23899-23902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), suggesting that the p53 central region, when existing in the mutant conformation, gains an inactivation function. It is not clear, however, whether the gain of function is a general phenomenon for mutant p53 central regions or just a special property of CRts247. To address this question, we analyzed the central regions of other mutants. Individual CRts from the three p53ts mutants identified to date (22Chen J.Y. Funk W.D. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2159-2166PubMed Google Scholar) was fused to GAL4VP16, and the transcriptional activity of the resultant fusion protein was measured. As shown in Fig.1 A, fusion of CRwtto GAL4VP16, consistent with previous results (10Chuang J.-Y. Lin C.-T. Wu C.-W. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23899-23902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), exhibited little effect on the transactivation activity of the hybrid protein regardless of the assaying temperature (compare lanes 3 and9 to lanes 2 and 8). In contrast, all three of the CRts repressed the transactivation activity of the GAL4 fusion protein at 37 °C and not at 30 °C (comparelanes 10–12 to lanes 4–6). The rationale to work with p53ts mutants was as follows. First, p53N247I, p53V143A, and p53V173Lall acquire a mutant-specific conformation at the nonpermissive temperature (22Chen J.Y. Funk W.D. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2159-2166PubMed Google Scholar, 23Friend S. Science. 1994; 265: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Second, it was aimed to take advantage of their thermo-regulability so that the repression activity could be directly related to their mutant conformation. However, the mutant conformation-specific repression activity was not unique to the three CRts because central regions from other p53 denaturing mutants (23Friend S. Science. 1994; 265: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) all repressed the GAL4 fusion protein. 2S.-F. Tung, J.-Y. Chuang, C.-T. Lin, M.-Y. Lai, C.-W. Wu, and Y.-S. Lin, unpublished results. Nonetheless, the three CRts differed quantitatively. Their ability to restore the activity of the fusion protein at the permissive temperature was repeatedly observed to obey the following order: CRts247 ≥ CRts173 ≫ CRts143(Fig. 1 A, lanes 4–6), suggesting that they were somewhat dissimilar in the extent of recovery to the wild-type conformation at the permissive temperature. An immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 1 B) showed that the difference in the transcriptional activity of the fusion proteins could not be explained by variations in their levels of expression. For example, whereas the concentration of GAL4VP16-CRts143 appeared to be equal to, if not higher than, that of other fusion proteins (Fig. 1 B, comparelane 4 to lanes 2, 3, and 5), its transactivation activity was the lowest (Fig. 1 A, comparelane 5 to lanes 3, 4, and 6). Another example was that, although all three CRts-fusion proteins were synthesized to a level similar to that of GAL4VP16-CRwt at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig.1 B, compare lanes 8–10 to lane 7), CRts-fusion proteins were inactive in stimulating transcription (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 10–12 tolane 9). Thus, it was concluded that all of the CRts possessed a movable and thermo-regulable inactivation function and that, among CRts of the p53tsmutants, CRts247 was optimal in terms of such an activity. In addition, these data suggested that the closer the mutation site was positioned to the N-terminal end of the central region of a p53ts mutant, the less the corresponding CRtsfunctioned as a movable regulatory cassette. Next, using GAL4VP16-CRts247 as an example, we set out to address the underlying molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the observation that CRts-chimeric proteins turned into transcriptional activators after the temperature was shifted from 37 to 30 °C (Fig. 1; also see Ref. 10Chuang J.-Y. Lin C.-T. Wu C.-W. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23899-23902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Conceivably, an increase in the transactivation activity of GAL4VP16-CRts247 at the permissive temperature might be because of the reactivation of the hybrid molecules already present in the cell. Alternatively, de novo synthesis of additional hybrid molecules was the underlying mechanism for the increase of transactivation activity after the temperature shift. To differentiate these possibilities, we examined the effect of cycloheximide, a potent inhibitor of translation, on the transactivation activity of the hybrid protein. Because protein synthesis was shut down in the presence of cycloheximide (data not shown), the transactivation activity of GAL4VP16-CRts247was determined by quantifying the CAT mRNA rather than the CAT protein. As shown in Fig. 2, at 37 °C and in the presence of GAL4VP16-CRts247, the CAT transcript was barely detectable by primer extension (lane 5). After the assaying temperature was shifted to 30 °C, the level of CAT transcript dramatically increased (lane 3). Importantly, the thermo-regulated increase of CAT transcript was still observed in the presence of cycloheximide (lane 4), demonstrating thatde novo protein synthesis was not required for the restoration of the activity of the fusion protein at the permissive temperature; i.e. a post-translational mechanism was involved in the reactivation of GAL4VP16-CRts247. Because nuclear localization is a prerequisite for a transcription factor to exert its regulatory role, one potential mechanism responsible for the inactivity of GAL4VP16-CRts247 at the nonpermissive temperature is that the fusion protein is sequestered in the cytoplasm, especially in light of the report that some mutant p53 proteins are found to be distributed abnormally (4Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we performed an immunostaining study to inspect the subcellular distribution of the fusion protein. Fig. 3 shows that GAL4VP16-CRts247 was predominately localized to the nucleus, regardless of the assaying temperature. Thus, the inactivity of GAL4VP16-CRts247 in transactivating gene expression at 37 °C could not be attributed to the exclusion of the protein from the nucleus. Another possible mechanism for the observed inactivity was that GAL4VP16-CRts247, although present in the nucleus at the nonpermissive temperature, failed to bind its cognate site so that a promoter driven by GAL4 sites was, of course, not activated. To investigate this possibility, we determine the in vivo DNA-binding activity of the GAL4 chimeric proteins using the well established blocking assay (10Chuang J.-Y. Lin C.-T. Wu C.-W. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23899-23902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 24Martin K.J. Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, five copies of GAL4-binding sites were placed immediately downstream of the TATA box of a reporter. In this way, binding of GAL4 derivatives would block, via steric hindrance, assembly of the transcription initiation complex on the promoter and therefore reduce CAT activity. GAL4-(1–147), a derivative providing only GAL4 DNA-binding activity, as well as GAL4VP16-CRwt and GAL4VP16-CRts247, all inhibited transcription from the reporter containing GAL4 binding sites at 37 °C (Fig. 4, comparelanes 3–5 to lane 2). The reduction was specific because transcription of a corresponding reporter lacking GAL4 binding sites was not affected (Fig. 4, compare lanes 8–10 tolane 7). It was concluded that the GAL4 module of the fusion protein was still able to bind its cognate site even at the nonpermissive temperature. Because neither the nuclear localization (Fig. 3) nor the DNA-binding activity (Fig. 4) of the chimeric protein was altered, only the possibility that the VP16 activation domain of the fusion protein was the target of regulation by CRts247 remained viable. It is possible that CRts247 inhibits the VP16 domain by competing for a putative factor(s) that is required for the transactivation by VP16. In other words, this hypothesis predicts that CRts247 should function in trans as well; i.e. the transactivator and CRts247 co-exist as two individual molecules. Accordingly, experiments were performed to examine whether activator GAL4VP16 was repressed at 37 °C by CRts247 in trans. As shown in Fig.5 A, CRts247 was found to reproducibly repress GAL4VP16 in cis (lane 3). In contrast, the transactivation activity of GAL4VP16 remained constant (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 5–8 tolane 4) in the presence of a broad range of CRts247 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–5). Moreover, the fact that CRts247 was unable to inhibit activator GAL4VP16 in trans was not because of the possibility that CRts247 itself failed to enter into the nucleus because CRts247, a protein of about 30 kDa, was observed to be homogeneously distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus by immunofluorescence (data not shown). Thus, two conclusions could be drawn from the above study. First, CRts247 did not work via competing for a putative transcription factor(s). Second, and consequently, CRts247 could not be exploited as a regulatory cassette in trans. Because CRts247 only functioned in cis (Figs. 1 and 5; also see Ref. 10Chuang J.-Y. Lin C.-T. Wu C.-W. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23899-23902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar),i.e. it repressed a transactivation domain present on the same polypeptide chain only at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) and not at the permissive temperature (30 °C), an alternative mechanism was proposed to explain how CRts247 functions. Perhaps, a spreading of the temperature-dependent structural transition from CRts247 into the neighboring region may account for the distinct behavior of CRts247. In other words, the conformation of a neighboring activation domain could be influenced by CRts247 so that the affinity of the activation domain to its target(s) is greatly reduced. In this regard, it was worthy to note that the activation domains of VP16 and p53 share the ability both to be regulated by CRts247 (Ref. 10Chuang J.-Y. Lin C.-T. Wu C.-W. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23899-23902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and to interact with a common co-activator, hTAFII32 (11Goodrich J.A. Hoey T. Thut C.J. Admon A. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 75: 519-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 25Lu H. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5154-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Thus, it was compelling to question whether CRts247inhibits the VP16 and p53 activation domains via interference of their interaction with hTAFII32 at the nonpermissive temperature. To test this idea, a GST pull-down assay was performed. In brief, hTAFII32 was expressed and purified from bacteria as a GST fusion protein, GST-hTAFII32. Binding of32P-labeled GAL4 derivatives to hTAFII32 was measured by their retention on glutathione beads preloaded with the GST fusion protein. As expected, fusion of CRwt to the VP16 activation domain showed little effect on the affinity of the chimeric protein toward hTAFII32, regardless of the assaying temperature (Fig. 6 A, comparelane 2 to lane 4). In contrast, binding of the CRts247-fusion protein to hTAFII32 became temperature-dependent: GAL4VP16CRts247interacted with hTAFII32 at the permissive temperature (Fig. 6 A, lane 8) but not at the nonpermissive one (Fig. 6 A, lane 6). Besides, neither of the hybrid activators was retained by control GST beads (Fig.6 A, lanes 1 and 5), indicating that the observed binding was specific for hTAFII32. Also, in consistence with previous reports (11Goodrich J.A. Hoey T. Thut C.J. Admon A. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 75: 519-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 25Lu H. Levine A.J.

A. 1995; 92: 5154-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), the VP16 domain was required for the observed binding of GAL4VP16-CRts247 to hTAFII32 because GAL4-CRts247, a derivative with the VP16 domain removed, was not retained by the column at 30 °C (data not shown). In a parallel experiment, wild-type p53-(1–318) was also retained by the beads regardless of the assaying temperature (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2 and 4). However, the analogous region from p53N247I bound to the beads much better at the permissive temperature than at the nonpermissive one (Fig. 6 B, compare lane 8 tolane 6). For the sake of simplicity, the C-terminal truncated p53 proteins were used rather than the full-length ones to exclude the bacterial heat shock 70-kDa protein, which has been shown to interact with the C terminus of p53 (26Pinhasi-Kimhi O. Michalovitz D. Ben-Zeev A. Oren M. Nature. 1986; 320: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 27Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), from complicating the interpretation of the experiment. Using the C-terminal truncated proteins also excluded the repression domain of the C terminus of p53 (5Horikoshi N. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16Hsu Y.-S. Tang F.-M. Liu W.-L. Chuang J.-Y. Lai M.-Y. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6966-6974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), further simplifying the experiment. Taken together, the observation that CRts247 conferred temperature-sensitive binding of hTAFII32 to the VP16 and p53 activation domains not only was consistent with the conformation-spreading hypothesis but also strongly suggested that the temperature-dependent interaction of these domains with hTAFII32 was one of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the activity of CRts247 in vivo. It has been shown that the central region of p53N247Igains a thermo-regulable repression activity toward several transcriptional activation domains (10Chuang J.-Y. Lin C.-T. Wu C.-W. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23899-23902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the central regions of p53ts mutants all behave similarly (Fig. 1). The thermo-regulability of CRts247requires neither new protein synthesis (Fig. 2), nor an alteration of the subcellular localization of the chimeric protein (Fig. 3). In addition, CRts247 does not inactivate the DNA-binding activity of the chimeric protein (Fig. 4). Further, CRts247does not work via the competition for a putative transcription factor(s) that is required for the activity of a neighboring activation domain (Fig. 5). Rather, a temperature-dependent binding of hTAFII32 to the activation domains of chimeric proteins may account for the thermo-regulability of CRts247-fusion proteins (Fig. 6). However, both the VP16 and the p53 activation domain can bind several transcription factors (4Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Tantin D. Chi T. Hori R. Ryo S. Carey M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that, to achieve the observed repression, CRts247 may also interfere with the interaction of VP16 and p53 activation domains with transcription factors other than hTAFII32. This possibility is strengthened by the study that the activation domain of adenovirus E1a protein is likewise subjected to the thermo-regulation by a juxtaposing CRts247(10Chuang J.-Y. Lin C.-T. Wu C.-W. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23899-23902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, there is no evidence supporting that the E1a activation domain augments gene expression by interacting with hTAFII32. Taken together, these observations strongly argue that the interference of hTAFII32 binding to neighboring activation domains is probably not the only mechanism responsible for the repression function of CRts247. p53 is the most frequently mutated gene found in human cancer. Mutant p53 is believed to adopt a conformation that is different from that of wild-type p53 (7Cook A. Milner J. Br. J. Cancer. 1990; 61: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Milner J. Medcalf E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because of their increased stability, mutant p53 proteins accumulate to a high concentration in cancer cells, and in many cases, they are found to be localized to the nucleus (30Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 31Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Tosky M.S. Levine A.J. Rotter V. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2055-2065PubMed Google Scholar). The strength of p53 activation domain (32Fields S. Jang S.K. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 33Raycroft L. Wu H.Y. Lozano G. Science. 1990; 249: 1049-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 34Farmer G. Bargonetti J. Zhu H. Friedman P. Prywes R. Prives C. Nature. 1992; 358: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) is comparable with that of VP16, the strongest one known to date. Theoretically, it should cause a problem described as transcriptional squelching (35Gill G. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 334: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) in cancer cells harboring a mutant p53 if the activation domain of such a mutant p53 is still active. In light of this, the finding that p53 mutants usually lose not only the DNA-binding but also the transactivation activities (this work and see Ref.10) seems biologically relevant. However, it is not clear how p53 mutants inactivate their transactivation domain. Using temperature-sensitive p53 mutants as a model, we demonstrate that the central region, when trapped in the mutant conformation, gains a repression function by preventing, at least, hTAFII32 from interacting with the p53 activation domain. In support of this hypothesis, destruction of the intactness of the central region of wild-type p53 by deletion, which is thought to cause a conformational change by disrupting the compact packing of the region (36Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar) so that a repression domain approximately encompassing amino acids 101–170 is activated (16Hsu Y.-S. Tang F.-M. Liu W.-L. Chuang J.-Y. Lai M.-Y. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6966-6974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), also renders the resultant p53 fragments with a repression activity (16Hsu Y.-S. Tang F.-M. Liu W.-L. Chuang J.-Y. Lai M.-Y. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6966-6974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37Liu X. Miller C.W. Koeffler P.H. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In contrast, the central regions of p53 mutants that retain the wild-type conformation, such as p53R248W, p53R273H, and p53R280K(23Friend S. Science. 1994; 265: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), behaved like that of wild-type p53 and could not repress the p53 and VP16 activation domains (22Chen J.Y. Funk W.D. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2159-2166PubMed Google Scholar).2 The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of steroid receptors can also function as a movable and regulable inactivation cassette (38Mattioni T. Louvion J.F. Picard D. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There exist, however, differences between CRts247 and LBD. First of all, the activity of CRts247 is regulated by temperature (Ref.10Chuang J.-Y. Lin C.-T. Wu C.-W. Lin Y.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23899-23902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar and this work), in contrast to the case of LBD which is controlled by its cognate steroid hormone (38Mattioni T. Louvion J.F. Picard D. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Second, whereas it is presumed that steric hindrance via the interaction of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) with the unliganded LBD is mainly responsible for the inactivation of fusion proteins (39Picard D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 278-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), several lines of evidence indicate that CRts247 does not require the interaction with a putative bulky protein to function as an autonomous regulatory cassette. First, although HSP70 and HSC70 are known to bind to p53, they do not bind to the central region (4Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In fact, we could not detect any interaction between CRts247 and HSP70, HSC70, or HSP90 by various biochemical and genetic approaches (data not shown). Second and more importantly, recombinant hTAFII32 and CRts247-fusion proteins, expressed in and purified from bacteria, directly interact with each other in a temperature-dependent manner (Fig. 6). Accordingly, our experimental results do not favor the bulky protein model to explain how CRts247 functions. Instead, available data are consistent with the conformation-spreading hypothesis to explain the molecular mechanism by which CRts247 represses the neighboring transactivation domain present on the same polypeptide chain. Nevertheless, because the partial digestion patterns of GAL4VP16-CRts247 by several proteases, including V8 protease, endoproteinase Arg-C, α-chymotrypsin, m-calpain, and alkaline protease, in the presence or absence of hTAFII32 at either 30 °C or 37 °C were not informative (data not shown), future studies are required to directly test the hypothesis.
