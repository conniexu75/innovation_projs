https://openalex.org/W2106799894,Heterodimerization between members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins is a key event in the regulation of programmed cell death. The molecular basis for heterodimer formation was investigated by determination of the solution structure of a complex between the survival protein Bcl-x L and the death-promoting region of the Bcl-2-related protein Bak. The structure and binding affinities of mutant Bak peptides indicate that the Bak peptide adopts an amphipathic Î± helix that interacts with Bcl-x L through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Mutations in full-length Bak that disrupt either type of interaction inhibit the ability of Bak to heterodimerize with Bcl-x L .

In the present studies we have tested whether these responses could be mediated by thrombin receptors or PAR-2, two G-protein-coupled receptors that are activated by proteolysis. When added to a peptide corresponding to the N terminus of PAR-2, tryptase cleaved the peptide at the activating site, but at higher concentrations it also cleaved downstream, as did trypsin, a known activator of PAR-2. Thrombin, factor Xa, plasmin, urokinase, plasma kallikrein, and tissue kallikrein had no effect. Tryptase also cleaved the analogous thrombin receptor peptide at the activating site but less efficiently. When added to COS-1 cells expressing either receptor, tryptase stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. With PAR-2, this response was half-maximal at 1 nM tryptase and could be inhibited by the tryptase inhibitor, APC366, or by antibodies to tryptase and PAR-2. When added to human endothelial cells, which normally express PAR-2 and thrombin receptors, or keratinocytes, which express only PAR-2, tryptase caused an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. However, when added to platelets or CHRF-288 cells, which express thrombin receptors but not PAR-2, tryptase caused neither aggregation nor increased Ca2+. These results show that 1) tryptase has the potential to activate both PAR-2 and thrombin receptors; 2) for PAR-2, this potential is realized, although cleavage at secondary sites may limit activation, particularly at higher tryptase concentrations; and 3) in contrast, although tryptase clearly activates thrombin receptors in COS-1 cells, it does not appear to cleave endogenous thrombin receptors in platelets or CHRF-288 cells. These distinctions correlate with the observed differences in the rate of cleavage of the PAR-2 and thrombin receptor peptides by tryptase. Tryptase is the first protease other than trypsin that has been shown to activate human PAR-2. Its presence within mast cell granules places it in tissues where PAR-2 is expressed but trypsin is unlikely to reach.

Tryptase is a trypsin-like serine protease that is released by activated mast cells, leading to elevated levels in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and other sites (1Wenzel S.E. Fowler A.A. Schwartz L.B.

Although it has been shown that tryptase must be proteolytically active to elicit these responses, little else is known about the mechanisms underlying its effects on cells. To begin to dissect this process, we have examined the interaction of tryptase with thrombin receptors and PAR-2, the only two known members of the family of protease-activated G-protein-coupled receptors. Thrombin receptors and PAR-2 are similar in structure to other G-protein-coupled receptors, but they are activated by a novel mechanism in which a protease binds to the N terminus of the receptor and cleaves it (12Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar, 13Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). This exposes a new N terminus, the first 5 or 6 residues of which serves as a tethered ligand, activating the receptor by interacting with sites within the exofacial loops of the receptor (14Gerszten R.E.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13943-13947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One piece of evidence supporting this mechanism of activation is that synthetic peptides corresponding to the tethered ligand domains of the thrombin receptor and PAR-2 are able to act as full agonists on their respective receptors (12Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar, 13Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Thrombin receptors were originally identified by their ability to respond to thrombin, but subsequent studies have shown that they can be activated by other proteases capable of exposing the tethered ligand, provided, of course, that the protease does not disable the receptor by cleaving it at additional sites. Trypsin is one example of a protease that can activate thrombin receptors by cleaving the N terminus at the same site as thrombin (12Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar, 16Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Williams A.G. Woolkalis M.J. Poncz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 958-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cathepsin G, on the other hand, cleaves thrombin receptors at the normal thrombin site (Arg41-Ser42) but also at a second site downstream from the first (Phe55-Trp56). As a result, exposure of thrombin receptors to cathepsin G prevents a subsequent response to thrombin, and cathepsin G is able activate human thrombin receptors on its own only when the second site is mutated or otherwise blocked (17Molino M.

Much less is known about the proteases that can activate PAR-2, although trypsin is clearly among them and thrombin is not (13Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Based upon the apparent tissue distribution of PAR-2 mRNA, it seems unlikely that trypsin is the sole protease capable of activating it, but others have not yet been described. Thrombin receptors and PAR-2 have a wide, but only partially overlapping, tissue distribution. Some cells, including platelets and several megakaryoblastic cell lines, express thrombin receptors (12Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

It had been inferred previously that tryptase does not activate thrombin receptors but may, if anything, disable them (7Ruoss S.J. Hartmann T. Caughey G.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 9Hartmann T. Ruoss S.J. Caughey G.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L113-L119PubMed Google Scholar). However, this had not been tested directly, and although no information was available about the interaction of tryptase and PAR-2, the resemblance between the amino acid sequence surrounding the activating cleavage site in human PAR-2 and known peptide substrates for tryptase (29Tanaka T. McRae B.J. Cho K. Cook R. Fraki J.E. Johnson D.A. Powers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13552-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that PAR-2 might be a substrate for tryptase. The results that were obtained show that tryptase can cleave synthetic peptides at the correct site for activation of both receptors, although the PAR-2 peptide was cleaved more efficiently. When added to intact receptors, tryptase cleaved endogenous and transfected PAR-2. It also cleaved thrombin receptors overexpressed in COS-1 cells but did not activate endogenous thrombin receptors on platelets or megakaryoblastic CHRF-288 cells. This failure to activate endogenous thrombin receptors appears not to be due to a cathepsin G-like cleavage of a secondary site within the receptor N terminus but may reflect the relatively slower rate of hydrolysis suggested by peptide studies. Therefore, in addition to identifying the first protease other than trypsin that can activate PAR-2, these results suggest that factors in addition to receptor primary sequence limit the ability of proteases to evoke responses from this subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. Highly purified Î±-thrombin was provided by Dr. J. Fenton (New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY) and Calbiochem. Trypsin was obtained from Sigma and Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). Plasmin was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Urokinase was obtained from Calbiochem. The tissue kallikrein that was used was prepared as a recombinant protein at Arris Pharmaceutical Corp. Plasma kallikrein was obtained from Athens Research and Technology. Factor Xa was obtained from Hematologic Technologies, Vermont. The cDNA for human PAR-2 was generously provided by Dr. J. Sundelin (Lund University, Lund, Sweden). Antibody SAM11 is an IgG2a monoclonal antibody produced in mice immunized with the peptide SLIGKVDGTSHVTG, corresponding to residues 37-50 of the human PAR-2 sequence. Further details about this antibody will be provided elsewhere. 2E. S. Barnathan, M. Molino, J. A. Hoxie, and L. F. Brass, manuscript in preparation. Antibodies SPAN12, ATAP2, and WEDE15 are peptide-directed monoclonal antibodies that recognize sites within the N terminus of the human thrombin receptor and have been described previously (22Hoxie J.A.

Schwartz (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). APC366 is a novel human tryptase inhibitor synthesized by the medicinal chemistry group at Arris Pharmaceutical Corp. (31Clark J.M. Abraham W.M. Fishman C.E. Forteza R. Ahmed A. Cortes A. Warne R.L. Moore W.R. Tanaka R.D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 2076-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The tryptase used in the peptide hydrolysis and cell response studies was purified from an immortalized human mast cell line (HMC-1) donated by Dr. J. Butterfield (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) using an established protocol (32Butterfield J.H. Weiler D. Hunt L.W. Wynn S.R. Roche P.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 47: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of purified tryptase was determined by spectrophotometrically measuring the hydrolysis of the substrate N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA (Sigma) (33Smith J.T. Hougland M.W. Johnson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11046-11051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of individual batches of tryptase ranged between 71 and 117 units/mg, where 1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 Î¼mol of substrate/min at 37Â°C. In addition, some of the cell response studies were repeated with tryptase isolated from human skin (34Schechter N.M. Eng G.Y. Selwood T. McCaslin D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10628-10638Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The same results were obtained. COS-1 cells, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, were transiently transfected using DEAE-dextran with either the human thrombin receptor or human PAR-2 (1.5 Î¼g/ml) in pRK7 as described previously (17Molino M. Blanchard N. Belmonte E. Tarver A.P. Abrams C. Hoxie J.A. Cerletti C. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11168-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). One day after transfection the cells were detached from the plates with trypsin/EDTA treatment and split into 60-mm tissue culture dishes. Two days after transfection, agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis was measured (see below). Receptor expression was measured on the same day using flow cytometry and antibodies SAM11 (PAR-2) and WEDE15 (thrombin receptor). To measure inositol phosphate formation, the transfected COS-1 cells were incubated overnight with 4 Î¼Ci/ml of [3H]inositol (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA; specific activity 20 Ci/mmol) beginning 24 h after transfection. Afterwards, the cells were washed and incubated at 37Â°C with 20 mM LiCl for 1 h and then stimulated with thrombin or tryptase at the concentrations indicated for 45 min at 37Â°C. Total [3H]inositol phosphates were extracted with perchloric acid, neutralized, and analyzed by ion exchange chromatography on Dowex columns (35Dean N.M. Beaven M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) after adding phytic acid (15 Î¼g/sample) as a carrier. Early passage human umbilical vein endothelial cells were prepared as described previously (26Woolkalis M.J. DeMelfi Jr., T.M. Blanchard N. Hoxie J.A. Brass L.F. J. Biol.

Changes in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration were measured with an SLM/Aminco model AB2 fluorescence spectrophotometer after loading the cells with Fura-2 (26Woolkalis M.J. DeMelfi Jr., T.M.

Blood was obtained from healthy volunteers and anticoagulated with acid-citrate-dextrose. Washed platelets were prepared as described previously (36Molino M. Di Lallo M. De Gaetano G. Cerletti C. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and resuspended in HEPES-Tyrode at 2 Ã 108/ml. Platelet aggregation was measured after adding CaCl2 (2 mM) and fibrinogen (0.1 mg/ml). Peptides corresponding to regions spanning or surrounding the cleavage sites of the human thrombin receptor and PAR-2 were synthesized at Arris Pharmaceutical Corp. or the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center Protein Chemistry Facility. Peptides (200 Î¼M) were incubated with proteases for 30 min at 37Â°C in phosphate-buffered saline, and cleavage products were analyzed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. All mass spectrometry was performed on a Finnigan-MAT (San Jose, CA) TSQ-7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Finnigan-MAT electrospray ionization source. The electrospray source was coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 1050 liquid chromatography system. The samples were scanned over a range of m/z 200-1500 in 1 s. The chromatography was performed on a 3.2 Ã 100 mm, 5-Î¼m ODS Prodigy column from Phenomenex (Torrence, CA) using a linear gradient from 0 to 100% buffer B over 20 min at 500 Î¼l/min. Buffer A consisted of water/acetonitrile/acetic acid/trifluoroacetic acid (98.9:1:0.1:0.02). Buffer B consisted of water/acetonitrile/acetic acid/trifluoroacetic acid (1.0:98.9:0.1:0.02). PAR-2 was thought to be a potential substrate for tryptase, because an earlier analysis of the P3P2P1 site preferences for tryptase in cleaving tripeptide nitroanilide substrates had revealed that the highest catalytic efficiency was for the tripeptide, Lys-Gly-Arg (â¼4 Ã 105Mâ1 sâ1) (29Tanaka T.

Chem. 1983; 258: 13552-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which matches the P3P2P1 sequence at the activating cleavage site of human PAR-2 (Fig. 1). This sequence is different from the corresponding region of the human thrombin receptor. We and others have shown previously that longer peptides corresponding to sequences within the N terminus of the human thrombin receptor can be useful for predicting potential sites of cleavage within the intact receptor (17Molino M.

Andersen T.T. Fenton II, J.W. Bahou W.F. Aviv A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C54-C60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, tryptase was added to peptides whose sequences correspond to the regions around the activating sites of human thrombin receptors and PAR-2. In addition, trypsin and several other serine proteases were studied whose distribution might reasonably be expected to bring them into contact with PAR-2. Proteolytic fragments were identified by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. At a final concentration of 1 nM, tryptase cleaved a peptide corresponding to residues 32-45 in the human PAR-2 sequence at the site (Arg36-Ser37) that would expose the receptor's tethered ligand domain (Table I). At 100 nM, tryptase cleaved all of the starting material and, in addition, produced a further fragment by cleaving after the residue corresponding to Lys41. Cleavage at the latter site, were it to occur in the intact receptor, would disrupt the tethered ligand domain (SLIGKV), although this secondary cleavage was relatively inefficient in terms of the fraction of peptide cleaved during the 30-min incubation period (less than 10% relative to the primary cleavage between Arg and Ser). Of the other proteases that were studied, only trypsin (which is known to activate PAR-2) showed the same pattern of concentration-dependent hydrolysis of the PAR-2 peptide, including the secondary cleavage at Lys-Val occurring at 100 nM (Table I). Neither thrombin, which does not activate PAR-2, urokinase, nor tissue kallikrein cleaved the PAR-2 peptide. Plasmin, factor Xa, and plasma kallikrein at 20 nM cleaved approximately 5% of the peptide over a 30-min period during which tryptase and trypsin at the same concentration cleaved >95% of the starting material.Table I.Proteolytic fragments of receptor-related peptidesEnzymeConcentrationReceptor (residues)PeptideFragment(s) detectednMTryptase1huPAR2ahuPAR2, human PAR-2.

In contrast, when thrombin and tryptase were added to a second peptide, SFLLRNPNDKYEPF, corresponding to thrombin receptor residues 42-55, tryptase cleaved the peptide at two sites, Arg-Asn and Lys-Tyr, while thrombin, even at 1000 nM, had no effect. Based upon these results, tryptase has the potential for activating human thrombin receptors as well as human PAR-2. However, it also has the potential to disable either receptor by cleaving the N terminus at one or more sites downstream from the activation site (Fig. 1). In the case of the PAR-2 peptide, there was a clear concentration dependence in the cleavage at the two sites, with only Arg-Ser cleaved at a tryptase concentration (1 nM) that activates the intact receptor (see below). Furthermore, trypsin, which is a known activator of PAR-2, showed the same pattern of cleavage. In the case of the thrombin receptor peptides, there was a clear difference between tryptase and thrombin. While thrombin cleaved the peptide only at the activating site, tryptase also cleaved at two additional sites, which, if they were to occur in the intact receptor, would amputate the tethered ligand domain (Fig. 1). This suggests that tryptase could activate PAR-2 but might disable thrombin receptors in the manner previously seen with cathepsin G. To test the interaction of tryptase with intact PAR-2 and thrombin receptors, the human forms of both receptors were individually overexpressed in COS-1 cells. [3H]inositol phosphate formation was used to detect receptor activation. PAR-2 expression was detected using the monoclonal antibody SAM11, which was produced in mice immunized with a peptide that includes the PAR-2 tethered ligand domain (residues 37-50). Thrombin receptor expression was detected with the monoclonal antibody, WEDE15, which binds to intact and cleaved thrombin receptors (22Hoxie J.A. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Pizarro S. Parton R. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results show that tryptase can activate human PAR-2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Peak inositol phosphate formation was 2.5-fold over base line and was half-maximal at 1 nM tryptase (Fig. 2). Tryptase had no effect on COS-1 cells transfected with the empty plasmid, pRK7, and increasing the tryptase concentration as high as 100 nM had no greater effect on the cells expressing human PAR-2 than was obtained with 10 nM tryptase (Fig. 3). This pattern of response was somewhat different from that observed with trypsin. At 1 nM, trypsin was, if anything, less potent than tryptase in stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the human PAR-2-expressing COS-1 cells, just as trypsin was somewhat less efficient than tryptase in cleaving the PAR-2 peptide that overlapped the activation site. However, at concentrations â¥10 nM, trypsin was more effective than tryptase in activating the human PAR-2-expressing COS-1 cells (Fig. 3). The dose-response curve for trypsin clearly continued to rise after the response to tryptase had become maximal. Tryptase also activated human thrombin receptors expressed in COS-1 cells. At 0.1, 1, and 10 nM, the response to tryptase in the human thrombin receptor-expressing cells was similar in magnitude to the response to tryptase in cells expressing PAR-2 (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Comparison of tryptase and trypsin.

This length regulation was shown to function independently of the orientation of the telomere repeats. The number of repeats at an individual telomere was reduced when hybrid proteins containing the Rap1p carboxyl terminus were targeted there by a heterologous DNA-binding domain. The extent of this telomere tract shortening was proportional to the number of targeted molecules, consistent with a feedback mechanism of telomere length regulation that can discriminate the precise number of Rap1p molecules bound to the chromosome end."

By using a very low concentration (2 nM) of a lipophilic cationic fluorescent probe, 3,3â²dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide, we were able to measure mitochondrial membrane potential(ÎÎ¨m) in live intact parasitized erythrocytes through flow cytometry. The accumulation of the probe into parasite mitochondria was dependent on the presence of a membrane potential since inclusion of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, a protonophore, dissipated the membrane potential and abolished the probe accumulation.

Plasmodium spp. are obligate intracellular parasites, spending a major portion of their life cycle within erythrocytes and converting these relatively inactive cells into metabolically thriving active hosts. At present, our knowledge of mechanisms by which the parasite accomplishes these changes is limited, as is our understanding of metabolic processes associated with parasitism. It is generally believed that glycolysis is the main source of ATP in erythrocytic stages of malarial parasites with little or no contribution by mitochondria to the cellular ATP pool (1Scheibel L.W.

Parasitol. 1988; 27: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is well established through studies in other systems that, in addition to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria are also central to many other physiological activities such as the metabolism of molecules such as amino acids, lipids, and heme, as well as intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (10Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland, New York1994: 655-683Google Scholar). These functions are achieved by the action of gene products encoded by both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Because most of the mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and imported into mitochondria, an active import mechanism is necessary for mitochondrial functions. Both metabolites and protein transport require maintenance of membrane potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane (11Mitchell P. Science. 1979; 206: 1148-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 12Schwarz E. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

In addition, mitochondrial preparations have been shown to contain ubiquinone cytochrome c oxidoreductase (bc1 complex) (17Fry M. Beesley J.E. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and cytochrome c oxidase activities (18Scheibel L.W. Miller J. Mil.

However, detailed studies of mitochondrial functions and their response to antimalarial drugs have been hampered by the technical difficulties of obtaining workable quantities of functional mitochondria. To circumvent these problems, we have explored the possibility of studying mitochondrial functioning in intact parasitized erythrocytes with a fluorescent activated cell scanner (FACS). We have used the ability of the lipophilic cationic fluorescent probe DiOC6(3) to partition into energized mitochondria as a measure of ÎÎ¨m. By using this assay, we were able to demonstrate that a new antiparasitic drug, atovaquone, rapidly collapses ÎÎ¨m in erythrocytes infected with a rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii An animal colony of BALB/cByJ mice was maintained in our American Association of Laboratory Animal Care accredited animal facility. P. yoelii 17XL was maintained in vivo in either male or female BALB/cByJ mice. Blood was collected in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 10 units of heparin/ml of HBSS at approximately 60% parasitemia. Red blood cells were washed three times with HBSS at low speed centrifugation (800 Ã g for 10 min each time). Washed erythrocytes were diluted 1:1 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and passed over a microcrystalline cellulose column to remove leukocytes and platelets (21Eling W. Bull W. H. O. 1977; 55: 105-114PubMed Google Scholar). Red blood cells depleted of leukocytes and platelets were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and infected red blood cells were enriched by centrifugation over a discontinuous Percoll density gradient as described elsewhere (22McNally J. O'Donovan S.M. Dalton J.P. Parasitology. 1992; 105: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Infected erythrocytes within 65% Percoll and 65-75% Percoll interphase were collected and contained predominantly trophozoites and schizonts as determined by Giemsa-stained thin blood smears. These preparations were free of leukocytes and platelets as judged by Giemsa staining. These fractions were pooled, washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and used in all of the experiments described here. All of the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors, e.g. antimycin, myxothiazole, rotenone, and cyanide; uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP); and antimalarials tetracycline and chloroquine, were purchased from Sigma. The antimalarial atovaquone was a gift from Glaxo Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC. Flow cytometric assays were carried out using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson Cellular Imaging). The flow cytometer was adjusted for forward scattering profile, side scattering profile and fluorescence detection of infected red blood cells at channel 1. Parasitized cells at a concentration of 5 Ã 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% fetal calf serum were incubated with a 2 nM final concentration of DiOC6(3) for 20 min at 37Â°C. At the end of the incubation period the suspension was aliquoted into eight tubes of 250 Î¼l each. Different concentrations of the compound to be tested were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min. At the end of the incubation period, each sample was subjected to flow cytometric analysis. For each sample, 10,000 events were counted at the same flow cytometer setting. The results were calculated from the mean fluorescence of 104 cells in a histogram. In each experiment, measurements of fluorescence in infected erythrocytes in the presence of dye (F+D) and in absence of dye (FâD) were carried out to establish baselines. Mitochondrial uptake of O2 was measured in a closed system using a Clark's oxygen electrode and K-IC oxygraph (Gilson Medical Electronics Inc., Middleton, WI) in a reaction volume of 1.5 ml at 37Â°C following the method of Chance and Williams (23Chance B. Williams G.R. Nature. 1955; 175: 1120-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The instrument was calibrated following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1.5 Ã 108 parasitized cells in 1.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% fetal calf serum were added into the chamber, and the rate of O2 consumption by infected erythrocytes was followed for 5 min. A desired concentration of the compound to be tested was added into the chamber using a Hamilton syringe. The rate of O2 consumption by infected erythrocytes was followed for the next 5 min. The rate of O2 consumption was expressed as nAO/108 infected erythrocytes/min. The difference in the rate of O2 consumption by infected erythrocytes in the presence versus the absence of the compound was calculated as the measure of respiration inhibition. All the compound concentrations were tested individually in a separate set of experiments. DiOC6(3) is a cationic, lipophilic fluorescent compound. When incubated with infected erythrocytes, it diffuses into cells and is concentrated several orders of magnitude into negative-inside mitochondria. A collapsed ÎÎ¨m will result in diffusion of the probe out of the mitochondria resulting in dissipation of the signal. As shown in Fig. 1A, incubation of parasitized erythrocytes with 2 nM DiOC6(3) led to the accumulation of the probe into parasites, which was reflected by the increase in fluorescence intensity. The fact that the accumulation of the probe within the mitochondria was dependent upon a membrane potential was shown by the dissipation of the signal intensity after incubation of infected erythrocytes with the protonophore CCCP (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 2A), cell-associated DiOC6(3) fluorescence intensity increased as a function of the probe concentration up to 50 nM. Incubation with CCCP dissipated cell-associated DiOC6(3) fluorescence. Maximal dissipation of about 70% was obtained at the probe concentration of 2 nM. At higher probe concentrations the cell-associated fluorescence became relatively resistant to CCCP-mediated dissipation. The inhibition of the fluorescence above 50 nM appears to be the result of the inhibition of electron transport by the dye (see below). The decrease in the extent of quenching by CCCP above 2 nM appears to result from the self-quenching of the dye on the interface of the mitochondrial membrane, which thus saturates the signal. Hence, we decided to use 2 nM DiOC6(3) as the final probe concentration for the ÎÎ¨m assay for malarial parasite. We also measured the kinetics of probe accumulation at 2 nM concentration in infected erythrocytes as shown in Fig. 2B A rapid accumulation of the probe in infected erythrocytes was observed, reaching maximum levels within 30 min. The slight reduction of fluorescent intensity after 30 min suggested that some self quenching occurred even at 2 nM dye concentration. Continued incubation of infected erythrocytes with the probe for longer than 60 min did not result in any significant change of fluorescence profile of the probe, indicating that partitioning of the probe into mitochondria had reached its equilibrium.Fig. 2Optimization of ÎÎ¨m assay using DiOC6(3). a, to determine the optimum probe concentration to be used in ÎÎ¨m assay, infected erythrocytes were incubated with different probe concentrations for the same period of time and subjected to FACS analysis. Results are presented both as the ratio of fluorescence intensity in the presence of the probe (F+D) and the background fluorescence (FâD) of the probe at different probe concentrations (â¢) and as the percent inhibition of fluorescence intensity with 40 Î¼M CCCP at different probe concentrations (â). B, the kinetics of probe accumulation. Infected erythrocytes were incubated with 2 nM DiOC6(3) for 2 h. For the first 30 min an aliquot was removed every 5 min and subjected to FACS analysis. Subsequently samples were removed at 15-30 min intervals and analyzed by FACS. Results are presented as the ratio of F+D/FâD at the indicated time points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because incubation with lipophilic compounds can also affect parasite physiology, we determined the effect of DiOC6(3) on mitochondrial functioning by measuring the rate of respiration in the presence and absence of DiOC6(3). As shown in Fig. 3, there was no significant effect of the probe at 2 nM upon the rate of O2 consumption. However, at the higher concentrations inhibition of respiration became apparent, reaching up to 50% at 150 nM DiOC6(3) concentration. Hence, for the rest of the study, DiOC6(3) was used at the final concentration of 2 nM. Having established a way to assay ÎÎ¨m in intact parasitized erythrocytes, we tested the effect of various known mitochondrial inhibitors on ÎÎ¨m. Inhibitors used were a protonophore (CCCP), a site I inhibitor (rotenone), site II inhibitors (antimycin and myxothiazole), and a site III inhibitor (cyanide). Fig. 4 shows representative histograms showing effects of these inhibitors (at the highest concentration tested) on mitochondrial accumulation of DiOC6(3) in infected erythrocytes. Fig. 5A shows the concentration-dependent dissipation of the fluorescence for each of these inhibitors. Rotenone did not have any significant effect on ÎÎ¨m, which is consistent with the earlier findings regarding the lack of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (site I) (17Fry M. Beesley J.E. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) in malarial parasites. Myxothiazole and antimycin collapsed ÎÎ¨m with an EC50 of 2 Ã 10â7M and 6 Ã 10â7M, respectively, consistent with the presence of the bc1 complex (site II) in malarial parasites. A much higher concentration of cyanide (6 mM) was required to completely collapse the ÎÎ¨m and dissipate the DiOC6(3) accumulation with an EC50 of 3 Ã 10â4M.Fig. 5The concentration-dependent effect of mitochondrial inhibitors on ÎÎ¨m and respiration. A, concentration-dependent effect of mitochondrial inhibitors on ÎÎ¨m. Fluorescence intensity was quantitated by FACS analysis in the presence of various concentrations of CCCP (â), antimycin (â¢), myxothiazole (âª), rotenone (â´), and cyanide (â¡). B, concentration-dependent effect of mitochondrial inhibitors on parasite respiration. Respiration rate by P. yoelii-infected erythrocytes was measured in the presence of various concentrations of antimycin (â¢), myxothiazole (âª), cyanide (â¡), and CCCP (â) and is plotted as percent inhibition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also tested the effect of these inhibitors on rate of respiration by infected erythrocytes as shown in Fig. 5B. Both antimycin and myxothiazole inhibited respiration with EC50 of 2.5 Ã 10â7M and 9 Ã 10â8M, respectively. At higher concentrations, i.e. 1 Ã 10â6M and above, both these drugs almost completely inhibited respiration. Rotenone had no apparent effect upon the rate of O2 consumption in the range of concentrations tested in this study. Surprisingly, CCCP did not have any appreciable effect on the respiration rate of infected red blood cells. This observation is counter to the classical effect of CCCP where a collapsed membrane potential leads to a release from respiration control over electron transport, resulting in an increased rate of O2 consumption. Having demonstrated a good correlation between the DiOC6(3) assay of ÎÎ¨m and respiration by intact infected erythrocytes, we decided to assess the effect of various antimalarial drugs on mitochondrial physiology. Three different drugs were tested: atovaquone, a new broad spectrum antiparasitic drug shown to inhibit the bc1 complex of the malarial parasite (24Fry M. Pudney M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar); tetracycline, an antibiotic thought to inhibit organellar protein synthesis (9Prapunwattana P. O'Sullivan W.J. Yuthavong Y.

Representative fluorescence histograms of infected red blood cells in the presence and absence of antimalarial compounds are presented in Fig. 6. It is clear that only atovaquone caused the depolarization of plasmodial mitochondria and dissipated the dye accumulation as observed by a change in flow cytometric profile, while the other two antimalarials chloroquine (Fig. 6B) and tetracycline (Fig. 6C) had no effect on membrane potential. In order to ascertain that atovaquone specifically affects malarial mitochondria, we also tested the effect of atovaquone on mouse lymphocyte mitochondria. No effect of atovaquone was detected on membrane potential of lymphocyte mitochondria (Fig. 6D). It is known that atovaquone does not inhibit mammalian mitochondrial bc1 complex (24Fry M. Pudney M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, in lymphocytes other respiratory inhibitors also fail to collapse ÎÎ¨m (see âDiscussionâ). Concentration dependence of the effect of the antimalarials tested on P. yoelii ÎÎ¨m is presented in Fig. 7A Atovaquone had an EC50 of 2.6 Ã 10â7M, with the maximum inhibition observed at â¼2 Ã 10â6M. Neither chloroquine nor tetracycline had any effect on malarial ÎÎ¨m even at millimolar concentrations. We also tested the effect of atovaquone on the rate of O2 consumption by parasitized red blood cells as shown in Fig. 7B Atovaquone inhibited P. yoelii respiration at an EC50 of 7 Ã 10â8M. At 2 Ã 10â5M and above, atovaquone inhibited 90% of the O2 consumption by infected red blood cells.Fig. 7The concentration-dependent effect of atovaquone and other antimalarial on ÎÎ¨m and respiration.

Our knowledge of mitochondrial physiology, however, is based largely upon classical studies done with easily accessible systems derived from tissues such as the liver and the heart (30Petit P.X. O'Connor J.E. Grunwald D. Brown S.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 31Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). To broaden our view it is necessary to study mitochondrial physiology in various cell types and organisms. In this report we describe a flow cytometric assay employing a cationic lipophilic fluorescent probe to monitor ÎÎ¨m in a rodent malarial parasite. Fluorescence-based demonstration of mitochondrial membrane potential has been used for many years with fluorochromes such as rhodamine 123 (32Jhonson L.V. Walsh M.L. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Most of these studies, however, involved fluorescence microscopy and employed micromolar concentration of the probe. Because the rhodamine dyes have adverse effects on mitochondrial respiration (36Modica-Napolitano J.S. Weiss M.J. Chen L.B. Aprille J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A cationic lipophilic fluorochrome, DiOC6(3) originally used at high concentrations to monitor intracellular membranes (39Teraski M. Song J. Wong J.R. Weiss M.J. Chen L.B. Cell. 1984; 38: 101-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 40Terasaki M. Chen L.B. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), appears to be a better alternative to assay ÎÎ¨m when used at low concentrations. We empirically determined the optimal concentration of the probe for ÎÎ¨m assay in intact malarial parasites as the concentration at which probe accumulation was essentially dependent on membrane potential and maximally dissipated by the protonophore CCCP. When used at the optimal concentration (2 nM), the probe did not dissipate significantly from the intact parasitized erythrocytes for up to 2 h. We also determined the effect of the probe on respiration by intact parasites, observing that at 10 nM and higher concentrations DiOC6(3) significantly affected respiration rate. We suggest that such parameters need to be established prior to utilization of this fluorochrome for studying mitochondrial physiology. The concentration of DiOC6(3) used for studying mitochondrial membrane potential in pre-apoptotic lymphocytes (40 nM) is 20-fold higher than what we have used in assaying ÎÎ¨m in malarial parasites (41Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Zanin C. Vayssiere J.-L. Petit P.X. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). This concentration completely inhibited mitochondrial respiration in lymphocytes and the fluorescence level was highly quenched.2 The optimal concentration for the determination ofÎÎ¨m in lymphocytes is 0.2 nM.2 Using this assay we determined the effects of various conventional mitochondrial inhibitors on ÎÎ¨m of intact malarial parasites and compared them for their effects on respiration. Rotenone did not affect either ÎÎ¨m or respiration, consistent with the previous studies that failed to observe NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (site I) of the respiratory chain in malarial parasites (17Fry M. Beesley J.E. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Two inhibitors of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (site II), myxothiazole and antimycin, as well as cyanide (a cytochrome c oxidase and site III inhibitor) collapsed ÎÎ¨m and inhibited respiration. These components of the respiratory chain have been observed in malarial parasites. It is interesting to note that the inhibition of the respiratory chain seems to result in rapid dissipation of ÎÎ¨m. This is in sharp contrast to what we observed in lymphocytes.2 For technical reasons, it was not possible to determine the effects of electron transport inhibitors on ÎÎ¨m and respiration at the same inhibitor/cell ratios. It is possible that higher inhibitor/cell ratios are necessary to collapse ÎÎ¨m than those required for respiration inhibition. Nevertheless, our results suggest that ÎÎ¨m in the parasite cannot be supported by ATP synthase, which is in agreement with the notion that erythrocytic stages of malarial parasite lack the machinery for oxidative phosphorylation. A puzzling observation was the lack of respiration stimulation following CCCP treatment. This is contrary to the general observation of increased oxygen consumption in mitochondria with collapsed membrane potential. This suggests that the electron transport in the malarial parasite is not controlled by the mitochondrial ÎH+. Atovaquone, a hydroxynaphthoquinone, is a drug initially developed as an antimalarial but now known to be also effective against several other eukaryotic microbial parasites such as toxoplasma and pneumocystis (42Hughes W.T. Gray V.L. Gutteridge W.T. Lalter V.S. Pudney M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Using cholate-lysed mitochondria from Plasmodium falciparum and P. yoelii, and externally provided heterologous (horse) cytochrome c at 100 micromolar concentration, Fry and Pudney (24Fry M. Pudney M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) observed that atovaquone inhibited cytochrome c reductase activity. Based upon these results, it was concluded that atovaquone acts at the cytochrome bc1 complex of the malarial respiratory chain. Unique structural features of the parasite cytochrome b a were speculated as being responsible for the therapeutic value of some of the hydroxynaphthoquinones as antimalarials (16Vaidya A.B. Lashgari M.S. Pologe L.G. Morrisey J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because malarial mitochondria do not seem to contribute much to the ATP pool, it has long been suggested that the main purpose for these organelles was to dispose of electrons generated by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (7Gutteridge W.E. Dave D. Richards W.H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 582: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8Gero A.M. Brown G.V. O'Sullivan W.J. J.

Parasitol. 1988; 27: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), an essential enzyme in pyrimidine biosynthesis. Since the parasites are unable to salvage pyrimidines, inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase has been suggested as the reason for antimalarial activity of compounds such as atovaquone (43Hammond D.J. Burchell J.R. Pudney M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 14: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our observation that atovaquone rapidly dissipates ÎÎ¨m provides another possible mechanism for the antimalarial activity of this drug. It is not entirely clear whether the collapse of ÎÎ¨m is a direct result of respiration inhibiton by atovaquone. Recent studies on programmed cell death (PCD) pathways in metazoan organisms have implicated mitochondria to be involved at earlier stages of the PCD cascade (41Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M.

Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 301-308PubMed Google Scholar) although underlying mechanisms are not known at present. We suggest that the inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport chain in malarial parasites also acts to initiate a cascade of events similar to PCD. It would be important to investigate the possibility that the PCD-like response is elicited by collapsed ÎÎ¨m in malarial parasites. Nevertheless, maintenance of ÎÎ¨m is likely to be critical for all stages of the malaria parasite's life cycle, and drugs that affect ÎÎ¨m are likely to act on all such stages. In accordance with this proposal atovaquone has been shown also to act against liver (54Davies C.S. Pudney M. Matthew P.J. Sinden R.E. Acta Leiden. 1989; 58: 115-128PubMed Google Scholar, 55Davies C.S. Nicholas J.C. Sinden R.E.

Further investigations on parasite mitochondrial physiology will be illuminating in our attempts to understand mechanisms of drug action and the development of newer strategies for chemotherapy of malaria.

Sp1 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that plays a major role in the regulation of a large number of gene promoters, including constitutive and inducible genes (1Kadonaga J.T.

Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins have similar structural features with highly conserved DNA-binding domains and they recognize GC and CT boxes with closely similar specificity and affinity (5Hagen G.

Moreover, it has been shown that both Sp1 and Sp3 proteins are ubiquitously expressed in many mammalian cell lines, whereas Sp4 expression appears to be restricted to certain cell types (5Hagen G.

Transfection experiments into mammalian and Drosophila SL2 cells have shown that Sp4, like Sp1, is a transcriptional activator of Sp1 responsive promoters, whereas Sp3 represses Sp1-mediated transcription (5Hagen G.

Clearly the existence of proteins similar to Sp1 suggests that gene regulation by Sp1 is more complex than previously assumed. We previously showed that transfer of the nonfinger region of the Sp3 protein to a heterologous DNA-binding domain confers repressor function to the fusion protein, allowing it to repress transcription from reporter promoters containing multiple DNA-binding sites. Our previous data suggest that repression by chimeric Sp3 proteins occurs via protein-protein interaction with components of the basal transcription complex (10De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the present study we have embarked on a detailed analysis of the Sp3 function. To investigate the transcriptional properties of Sp3 in mammalian cells we have used gene fusion experiments to dissect the functional domains of Sp3. We found that Sp3 is a bifunctional protein containing independent modular repressor and activator domains. The activation potential of Sp3 is distributed over an extensive glutamine-rich N-terminal region. The negative regulatory function has been mapped 5â² of the zinc finger region. Moreover, we demonstrated that the Sp3-repression ability is strikingly dependent upon the context of the Sp3 DNA-binding sites present in the reporter promoters. Sp3 functions as a repressor when it is bound to the promoter through multiple DNA-binding sites. Conversely, Sp3 turns out to be an activator when it is targeted to the promoter via a single DNA-binding site. In addition, using the Drosophila Schneider SL2 cells that lack endogenous Sp activity, we demonstrate that Sp3 does not possess an active repression domain that can function in insect cells, but rather it is a weak transcriptional activator of the human c-myc promoter, and it functionally co-operates in vivo with the TATA-binding general transcription factor TBP. 1The abbreviations used are: TBPTATA-binding proteinCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseTAFTBP-associated factorHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusPCRpolymerase chain reactionGRglucocorticoid receptor. TATA-binding protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase TBP-associated factor human immunodeficiency virus polymerase chain reaction glucocorticoid receptor. Our results suggest that Sp3 is a bifunctional transcriptional regulator and its predominant effect would depend on the context of Sp3 DNA-binding sites and on the nature of a co-repressor present in a particular cellular background. The â83HIV CAT reporter has been previously described (8Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), the GC-38HIV CAT is a derivative of the G5-38HIV (8Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) in which an oligonucleotide containing a single GC box was inserted into the XbaI site at â38 of the HIV promoter sequences. The pmyc-XÎN is a reporter plasmid containing the human c-myc promoter sequences from the XhoI-NaeI fragment spanning from â93 to +54 of the P2 transcription start site, and the pmyc-XÎNmut is the isogenic plasmid in which the single Sp1/Sp3-binding site located at position â53 was mutated by changing the CT box in a sequences containing adjacent SphI/XbaI sites as described previously (9Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar). The G5-XÎN and G1-XÎN contain five or a single GAL4-binding site inserted at the XhoI site of the pmyc-XÎN reporter, respectively. The XÎN-G5 and XÎN-G1 reporters contain five or a single GAL4-binding site inserted in the SphI/XbaI sites present in the pmyc-XÎNmut. The 3xCT-XÎN has been constructed by inserting in the SphI/XbaI sites present in the pmyc-XÎNmut, an oligonucleotide containing a triplicated CT box. The G5E1b (11Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 38-44Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and G1E1b are CAT reporter plasmids containing five or one GAL4-binding site upstream from the E1b TATA box, respectively. The Drosophila expression vectors pPacSp1 and pPacSp3 were previously described (6Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 8Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The pPacSp3BD expressing the Sp3 DNA-binding domain was constructed by PCR amplification of the fragment encoding the Sp3 zinc-finger domain (amino acids 577-667) using primers containing BamHI (forward primer) and XhoI (reverse primer) sites, respectively. The PCR product was then cut with BamHI/XhoI and inserted in the pPacSp1 digested with BamHI/XhoI. The dTBP expression plasmid Act-TBP was described previously (12Colgan J. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and it was kindly provided by J. Manley. The GAL4-Sp3 (1-527) plasmid has been described (8Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). All the GAL4-Sp3 expression plasmids were constructed by PCR amplification of the relevant region of Sp3 using primers containing the EcoRI site. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and cloned in the EcoRI site of pSG424 expressing the yeast DNA-binding domain (1-147) of GAL4 (13Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). All plasmids were analyzed by DNA sequencing to confirm correct construction. Fragments generated by PCR were sequenced in all cases to verify that no misincorporation had occurred during the reaction. Full details of each construction are available upon request. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation using subconfluent cell cultures using different amounts of reporter and effector plasmids. For normalization of transfection efficiencies a pCMVÎ²-Gal expression plasmid (1 Î¼g) was included in the co-transfections. Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells were grown in Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (8Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L.

CAT assays were performed with different amounts of extract to ensure linear conversion of the chloramphenicol with each extract and results are presented as the means Â± S.D. of at least four duplicated independent transfection experiments. The CAT activity was quantified using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager Systemâ¢. Using transfection experiments into mammalian cells we and others have previously shown that enhanced expression of Sp3 did not have any significant effect on the activity of promoters containing Sp-DNA-binding sites (6Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 8Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L.

Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, a severe limitation of these experiments is due to the constitutively high level of expression of both Sp1 and Sp3 proteins in mammalian cells (6Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 8Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was quite difficult to find an appropriate control expression vector for normalization of transfection efficiency. All promoters that are employed to express indicator proteins have GC boxes and could be thereby influenced by ectopically expressed Sp3. Hence, we have used gene fusion experiments to analyze the Sp3 transcription properties. We have recently reported a study on the behavior of chimeric transcription factors composed of the nonfinger domain of Sp3 and heterologous DNA-binding domains. We have shown that such chimeric proteins were able to repress the activation of transcription by several types of activators, indicating that Sp3 contains a portable repressor domain that can function independently from the zinc finger DNA-binding domain (10De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To elucidate the Sp3 domain(s) required for transcription regulation several coding regions of Sp3 were cloned in the expression vector pSG424, encoding the yeast DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1-147) of the transcription factor GAL4 (13Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Resulting chimeras were tested for the ability to transactivate a reporter containing five GAL4-binding sites in front of the E1b TATA box (11Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 38-44Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In parallel, a GAL4 reporter (G5-XÎN) with a high basal activity suitable for examining transcriptional repression was constructed. This reporter contains five GAL4-binding sites at position â93 relative to the P2 start site of human c-myc promoter (9Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar). Results of gel shift assays with transiently transfected HeLa cell extracts ensured that all of the fusion proteins were expressed at comparable levels and were competent for DNA binding (data not shown). Accordingly with our previous report (10De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) the GAL4-Sp3(1-527) chimera did not activate the G5E1B reporter and repressed G5-XÎN transcription 10-fold in our assay. Interestingly, the GAL4-Sp3(1-358) activates transcription of both reporters. When this region was subdivided into amino acids 1-191 or 189-339, these segments function as well as the large intact domain, albeit the region 189-339 at lower efficiency. Conversely, all fusion proteins containing amino acids 455-527 failed to activate G5E1B and repressed to a similar level (about 10-fold) the G5-XÎN reporter. These effects were specific to reporter plasmids containing GAL4 sites with no activation or repression being observed on reporter plasmids lacking such sites (Ref. 10De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, and data not shown). From the results shown in Fig. 1 it appears that, in contrast to an extensive redundant activation domain (amino acids 1-358), Sp3 contains a repressor function that can be precisely localized in the 72-amino acids (from position 455 to 527) adjacent to the DNA-binding domain. These data strongly suggest that Sp3 is a bifunctional protein containing domains that can both activate and repress transcription in transient transfection assays, and both domains can function as independent modular components of the Sp3 transcription factor. It has been reported that several transcription factors required reiteration of the cognate DNA-binding sites for prominent transcription activation (16Latchman D.S. Eucaryotic Transcription Factors. Academic Press, San Diego.1995Google Scholar). Moreover, BTEB, a transcription factor that binds to the same GC box as Sp1 and Sp3, exerts an opposite regulation of transcription depending on the number of BTEB DNA-binding sites (17Imataka H. Sogawa K. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These observations led us to construct the G1-XÎN and G1E1b reporters. These reporters are isogenic to G5-XÎN and G5E1b except for the presence of a single GAL4 DNA-binding site, respectively. We then tested the response of these promoters to the GAL4-Sp3(1-527) fusion protein. As reported in Fig. 2, A and B, opposite different results were observed using promoters containing five or one GAL4-binding site, respectively. Dose-dependent GAL4-Sp3(1-527)-mediated repression occurred when the G5-XÎN served as reporter, and no significant effects were found with the G5E1b reporter, which has a very low basal level of expression. Unexpectedly, coexpression of GAL4-Sp3(1-527) resulted in a dose-dependent activation of both G1-XÎN and G1E1B reporters. Therefore, it appears that the GAL4-Sp3(1-527) acts as activator or repressor depending on the number of GAL4-binding sites present in the test promoter. Since the reporter pmyc-XÎN contains a single Sp1/Sp3 DNA-binding site at â53, it is very likely that the activity of the G5-XÎN and G1-XÎN reporters is affected by both the ectopic GAL4 protein and endogenous Sp1/Sp3 proteins. We therefore sought to determine the GAL4-Sp3-mediated regulation in the absence of the DNA-binding site for endogenous Sp1-Sp3 proteins. To this end we substituted the CT box at â53 with a single (XÎN-G1) or five (XÎN-G5) GAL4 DNA-binding sites. The XÎN-G1 and XÎN-G5 reporters were co-transfected into HeLa cells along with increasing amounts of GAL4-Sp3(1-527) expression vector. Although the basal transcription levels of XÎN-G1 and XÎN-G5 were 5-fold lower then the parental pmyc-XÎN promoter, likely due to the absence of the positive CT element present at â53, basal CAT activity of both reporters was easily detectable. Coexpression of GAL4-Sp3(1-527) repressed in a dose-dependent manner the XÎN-G5 activity. Conversely, the opposite result was obtained using the XÎN-G1 as reporter. An evident dose-dependent activation was observed in the presence of GAL4-Sp3(1-527) effector (Fig. 2C). Therefore, a similar behavior of GAL4-Sp3(1-527) was observed using three different reporters. In each case we found that the nonfinger region of Sp3 was acting as a repressor when bound to multiple DNA-binding sites, and it acted as an activator when tethered to the promoter via a single DNA-binding site. Since GAL4-Sp3(1-527) contains both the activating and repressor domains as defined in Fig. 1, we sought to analyze the effects of the activating domain (1-358) and repressor domain (337-527) on promoters bearing one or five GAL4 DNA-binding sites, respectively. As reported in Fig. 3A, the glutamine-rich Sp3 domain functions as an activator of promoter bearing either one or five GAL4-binding sites, albeit the activation ability was higher on the reporter with five GAL4 sites. The Sp3 domain (337-527) repressed the G5-XÎN, but it has only a small repression effect on the isogenic G1-XÎN reporter (Fig. 3B). Thus, it appears that Sp3 is a dual-function regulator acting as repressor when bound to a promoter bearing multiple binding sites, and it functions as an activator when tethered to a promoter via a single DNA-binding site.Fig. 3G5-XÎN (striped bars) and G1-XÎN (black bars) reporters (5 Î¼g) were co-transfected with increasing amounts of GAL4-Sp3 (1-358) (A) and GAL4-Sp3 (337-527) (B) as indicated. The results are presented as described in the legend of Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have recently shown that both Sp1 and Sp3 proteins bind to the same sites of c-myc promoter, and co-transfection experiments in Drosophila Schneider SL2 cells, which are devoid of endogenous Sp1-like activity, indicated that enforced expression of Sp3 represses Sp1-mediated activation of c-myc promoter (9Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar). A likely interpretation of these results is that Sp3 lacks transactivation potential and it can suppress the Sp1 activity simply because it binds to, and thus competes for, the same DNA-binding sites. Alternatively, Sp3 may actively repress Sp1-dependent transcription due to the strong repressor domain located near the DNA-binding region. To test these possibilities we performed co-transfection experiments in Drosophila SL2 cells using as reporter the pmyc-XÎN promoter construct which contains a single Sp1/Sp3-binding site located 53 base pairs upstream from the P2 initiation site (9Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar). The Drosophila expression vectors for Sp1 and Sp3 (pPacSp1 and pPacSp3) have been previously described, and both proteins are expressed at a comparable efficiency in transfected SL2 cells (6Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 9Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the pPacSp3DB plasmid expressing the Sp3 DNA-binding domain alone was constructed. As reported in Fig. 4A the Sp1-mediated activation of the c-myc promoter was repressed by both the complete Sp3 protein and the DNA binding alone. Thus, it appears that the Sp3 repression of Sp1-mediated activation is likely due to competition of both proteins for the same DNA-binding site present in the c-myc promoter, rather than an active repression domain present in the Sp3 protein. Moreover, using increasing amounts of pPacSp3 vector we found a dose-dependent activation of the reporter plasmid pmyc-XÎN (Fig. 4B). No transactivation was seen with the pmyc-XÎNmut reporter. In this promoter the single Sp1/Sp3 DNA-binding site at â53 was mutated and it has been previously shown that this promoter construct does not bind both Sp1 and Sp3 (9Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar). Since the pmycXÎN construct contains a single Sp3-binding site, we wished to determine whether Sp3 activation was also occurring using an isogenic reporter containing multiple Sp3-binding sites. To this end we substituted the single CT box at â53 with three consecutive CT boxes. As reported in Fig. 5A, Sp3 was able to activate in a dose-dependent manner this reporter, albeit at a lower level compared to the Sp1-mediated activation. Finally, we used two HIV-based reporters bearing a single (GC-38HIV) and three GC boxes (â83HIV), respectively. The HIV long terminal repeat contains three GC-binding sites, and we have previously shown that Sp3 binds specifically to these GC sites (8Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). As reported in Fig. 5B, Sp3 alone has no significant effect on HIV basal transcription. Since the HIV promoter possesses a very low basal level of CAT expression in SL2 cells a potential negative regulation exerted by Sp3 would have been unscored. We therefore sought to increase the basal level of transcription by co-transfecting a vector expressing the dTBP basal transcription factor. Accordingly with previous studies, suggesting that TBP is rate-limiting for TATA box-containing promoters in SL2 cells (12Colgan J. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we found that an actin 5â²C-driven Drosophila TBP cDNA was able to increase the basal transcription of both HIV reporters (Fig. 5B). However, coexpression of TBP in the presence of Sp3 results in a synergistic effect resulting in enhanced transcription from the HIV promoters bearing a single or three GC boxes.Fig. 5A, the 3xCTXÎN (2 Î¼g) reporter, containing three CT boxes at position â53, was transfected into Drosophila SL2 cells along with increasing amounts of either pPacSp3 or pPacSp1 as indicated. Values represent averages of three independent transfections after normalization for the internal control Î²-galactosidase activity. B, 2 Î¼g of â83HIV (black) and 1xCGC-HIV (striped) were transfected into SL2 cells in the presence of pPacSp3 (2 Î¼g), Act-TBP (1 Î¼g), or both, as indicated. The results are reported as mean, after normalization with Î²-galactosidase activity, of at least three independent transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, our data strongly suggest that Sp3 does not possess an active repression domain that can function in Drosophila SL2. Rather, Sp3 is a relatively weak DNA-binding dependent activator of reporters containing either a single or multiple Sp3-DNA-binding sites and it is able to functionally co-operate in vivo with the TATA-binding protein TBP. The experiments described here demonstrate that Sp3 is a bifunctional protein containing domains that can both activate and repress transcription in transient transfection assays, and the predominant Sp3 function depends upon both the promoter and cellular context. We have found that Sp3 activation ability is distributed over an extensive redundant domain (amino acids 1-358). This region is strikingly similar to that of Sp1, thus both proteins have a N terminus glutamine-rich region that functions as a transferable activation domain. The Sp3 transcriptional repressor activity has been mapped in a small amino acid region located at the 5â² of the zinc finger DNA-binding domain, and this domain is sufficient to confer repression function when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. Our gene fusion experiments have shown that all chimeric GAL4 proteins containing the Sp3 region from amino acid residue 455 to 527 function as transcriptional repressors when bound to a promoter bearing multiple DNA-binding sites. These results suggest that the repressor domain is able to mask the glutamine-rich activating domain. Accordingly, GAL4 fusions lacking the repressor domain function as transcriptional activators. Notably, the ability of the repression domain to overcome the glutamine-rich activating region is lost when the protein is targeted to a promoter via a single DNA-binding site. We found that when Sp3 is bound to a promoter via a single GAL4 DNA-binding site it acts as a positive factor. Therefore, it appears that Sp3 is a dual-function regulator whose predominant activity depends upon the number of DNA-binding sites present in the promoter. At present the molecular basis of this transition is unknown. Transcription factors that activate in one circumstance and repress in another have been documented, and the molecular basis for these transitions is quite diverse (18Roberts S.G.E. Brenn M.R. Nature. 1995; 375: 105-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Kruppel converts from an activator to a repressor in a dose-dependent manner (19Sauer F. Jackle H. Nature. 1993; 364: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Sauer F. Fondell J.D. Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Jackle H. Nature. 1995; 375: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the Sp3-mediated regulation does not appear to be modulated by changing the relative Sp3 concentration (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). It is the context of DNA-binding sites that appears to determine the Sp3 mediated activity. A similar dual-function regulation has been described for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). It has been reported that GR can activate or repress transcription depending on how it is tethered to a target gene. When bound to a single glucocorticoid response element, GR activates gene expression. In contrast, when tethered to DNA via composite glucocorticoid response elements, GR represses gene expression (21Sakai D.D. Helms S. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Rottman F.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1144-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that the transcription activity of Ets-1 is modified upon DNA binding, and it has been suggested that allosteric changes may alter the structure of a transcription factor as a result of its interaction with DNA (22Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.P. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 23McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, we suggest that Sp3 may be modified by, or act in association with, a corepressor. However, different allosteric changes may occur depending upon the context of DNA-binding sites, allowing mutual exclusive interactions between diverse Sp3 domains and putative cofactors leading to a different transcription response. Biochemical approaches will be useful to decipher the molecular basis for the Sp3-mediated regulation. Whatever is the molecular mechanism responsible for the dual-function of Sp3 it is clear that the repression ability is depending upon the cellular context. In fact, we have shown that in Drosophila SL2 cells Sp3 does not possess an active repression capability that can function in this cellular background. We found that Sp3 functions as DNA-binding dependent activator of the c-myc promoter, albeit at a lower level compared to Sp1. It is pertinent to note that using the HIV reporters we were unable to detect any significant Sp3-mediated transactivation. However, coexpression of TBP with Sp3 led to a super-activation likely due to a functional interaction between Sp3 and TBP, as part of the TFIID complex. In vivo and in vitro cooperation between Sp1 and TFIID has been well documented (24Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 25Emili A. Greenblatt J. Ingles C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the glutamine-rich activation domain of Sp1 can interact with the TBP-associated factor dTAF110 and TBP itself (24Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 25Emili A. Greenblatt J. Ingles C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sp1 residues that are sensitive to mutations that abolish interaction with dTAF110 and transcription activation have been mapped (26Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both Sp1 and Sp3 contain very similar hydrophobic patches. Having established that both Sp1 and Sp3 function in a similar fashion in the TBP superactivation assay in vivo, it seems likely that the homologous glutamine-rich domains of Sp1 and Sp3 share a common pattern of protein-protein interactions. In vitro binding studies with recombinant TBP, dTAF110, and Sp3 are currently being performed. We thank Dr. J. Manley for the kind gift of plasmids."

Despite the dispersion of the R and C subunit genes to different chromosomal loci, mechanisms exist that coordinately regulate the intracellular levels of R and C protein such that cAMP-dependent regulation is preserved. We have created null mutations in the RIÎ² and RIIÎ² regulatory subunit genes in mice, and find that both result in an increase in the level of RIÎ± protein in tissues that normally express the Î² isoforms. Examination of RIÎ± mRNA levels and the rates of RIÎ± protein synthesis in wild type and RIIÎ² mutant mice reveals that the mechanism of this biochemical compensation by RIÎ± does not involve transcriptional or translational control. These in vivo findings are consistent with observations made in cell culture, where we demonstrate that the overexpression of CÎ± in NIH 3T3 cells results in increased RIÎ± protein without increases in the rate of RIÎ± synthesis or the level of RIÎ± mRNA. Pulse-chase experiments reveal a 4-5-fold increase in the half-life of RIÎ± protein as it becomes incorporated into the holoenzyme. Compensation by RIÎ± stabilization may represent an important biological mechanism that safeguards cells from unregulated catalytic subunit activity."

At least four Ser/Thr residues in HSF1 appeared to be inducibly phosphorylated during heat shock. Ser/Thr protein kinase inhibitors inhibited, and protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A and phorbol ester enhanced, hsp70-CAT reporter gene expression but not heat shock element DNA binding activity in HeLa cells undergoing a moderate heat shock. Calyculin A (5-20 nM) caused hyperphosphorylation of HSF1, the extent of which was comparable to that produced by moderate to severe heat shock. Upon recovery from a 42Â°C/30 min-heat shock, HSF1 trimers disassembled quantitatively within 2 h. Calyculin A interfered with the dissociation of HSF1 trimers. Thus, hyperphosphorylation increases the effective half-life of the HSF1 trimer, which may prolong factor activity subsequent to heat shock. Hyperphosphorylation also dramatically stimulated the transactivation function of HSF1: exposure to calyculin A of cells induced to form inactive HSF1 trimers resulted in the conversion of the inactive to active trimers.

INTRODUCTIONMany cellular regulators including transcription factors are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. A phosphorylation/dephosphorylation event may activate DNA binding ability, induce dimerization and specific DNA binding ability, prompt nuclear translocation, or cause association with a cofactor(s) or release from an inhibitor(s) (1Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar).

Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Nature. 1987; 329: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 3Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B.

However, there is a scarcity of evidence linking this hyperphosphorylation to HSF function, except for a study with yeast suggesting that a heat-induced phosphorylation event is necessary for deactivation of the factor in this organism (6Hoj A. Jakobsen B.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because stress profoundly alters cellular regulation, it seemed reasonable to expect that the cellular response to stress be integrated with normal signal transduction pathways. This study attempts to provide evidence for such integration through an examination of the effects of changes in the phosphorylation state of mammalian HSF1 on the activity of the transcription factor.Heat shock and other stresses trigger a series of events that result in an increase in the expression of hsp genes that is proportional to the severity and duration of the stress (7Voellmy R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 357-401PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which the cell determines the amounts of extra hsps needed to cope with a particular stress and ensures that these precise amounts are being synthesized are only incompletely understood. It is clear, however, that there are mechanisms operating at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (8DiDomenico B.J. Bugaisky G.E. Lindquist S. Cell. 1982; 31: 593-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The transcriptional mechanism controls the activity of HSF1. In its inactive form, HSF1 appears to reside in the cytoplasm as a monomer or a heteromeric complex (7Voellmy R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 357-401PubMed Google Scholar, 9Baler R. Zou J. Voellmy R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Stress activation of HSF1 involves the formation of homotrimers that are capable of specific DNA binding (to a heat shock element sequence, referred to herein as HSE) and of nuclear translocation. Homotrimerization, however, is not sufficient to enable the transactivation function of the factor. A second stress-induced event is required to render the factor transcriptionally competent. In the course of activation by heat and several other types of stress, or shortly thereafter, HSF1 also becomes hyperphosphorylated (4Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 5Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that one or both of the above regulatory events may be modulated or controlled by phosphorylation.Heat shock and other stresses are also known to cause rapid increases in the concentrations of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol (Ref. 7Voellmy R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 357-401PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein). Not unexpectedly, a recent report also documented increased nuclear protein kinase C activity. Heat shock may also activate the adenylate cyclase pathway. Furthermore, mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as Janus-activated kinase, stress-activated protein kinase, and RK/HOG1, are activated by heat shock and other stresses. One or more of these stress-activated kinases may be responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of HSF1.Preliminary support for the notion that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation may regulate HSF1 activity has come from observations that Ser/Thr protein kinase inhibitors 1-[5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl]-2-methyl-piperazine (H7), staurosporine, 2-aminopurine, and calphostin inhibit and that Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid potentiates hsp gene expression in cells exposed to a mild heat shock (10Yamamoto N. Smith N.W. Maki A. Berezesky I.K. Trump B.F. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Chang N.-T. Huang L.E. Liu A.Y.-C. J. Biol.

These observations provided a point of departure for the present study. Using a potent protein phosphatase inhibitor, evidence was obtained that hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 trimers both increases their transcriptional activity and inhibits their dissociation.DISCUSSIONUpon heat stress, HSF1 is hyperphosphorylated mainly on Ser and Thr residues. This hyperphosphorylation shows as an increase in the apparent monomer size of HSF1 in anti-HSF1 Western blots. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of HSF1 indicates heat-induced phosphorylation of residues in at least four different peptides. Based on the results of the present study that are discussed in more detail below, phosphorylation of one or more of these residues appears to increase the activity of the transactivation function of HSF1 and to reduce the rate of HSF1 trimer dissociation.Previous observations provided convincing evidence that activation of HSF1 involves at least two regulatory events that can be separated from one another. The first event converts inactive HSF1 monomers into DNA-binding and nuclear-localized trimers. The second event activates the transactivation function of these trimers. The first event is exemplified by findings that menadione, H2O2, or salicylate induce the formation of HSF1 trimers that are transcriptionally inert (20Bruce J.L. Price B.D. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 12-15PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jurivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mouse erythroleukemia cell line has been characterized in which HSF(1) trimerizes in response to heat shock but remains unable to enhance hsp gene transcription (22Hensold J.O. Hunt C.R. Calderwood S.K. Housman D.E. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1600-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, PrPSc-infected mouse cells show normal HSF1 trimerization upon heat shock treatment but are essentially incapable of raising the rate of synthesis of hsps (23Tatzelt J. Zuo J. Voellmy R. Scott M. Hartl U. Prusiner S. Welch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 2944-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of HSF1 in human cells transfected with a functional HSF1 cDNA gene results in the accumulation of DNA-binding and nuclear-localized trimers that are unable to activate hsp reporter genes (16Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes of mutant human HSF1 containing a single substitution in the third hydrophobic repeat (E391) results in inactive HSF1 trimers (16Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Evidence for a second heat-regulated event was provided by the observation that a chimeric LexA-HSF1 protein overexpressed in human cells can be heat-activated to transcribe a LexA-CAT reporter gene. Like wild-type HSF1, overexpressed LexA-HSF1 is found in a DNA-binding form in human cells. Thus, heat shock triggered a second regulatory event, i.e. the conversion of inactive to active trimeric factor. Similar findings were made in the frog oocyte in which a LexA-HSF1 protein containing the E391 mutation was a transcriptionally inactive trimer that could be activated by heat shock. Finally, the transcriptional activity of a GAL4-HSF1 chimera lacking sequences required for trimerization could be enhanced by extreme heat shock (18Green M. Schuetz T.J. Sullivan E.K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3354-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Newton E.M. Knauf U. Green M. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Evidence that hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 does not play a role in the first regulatory event is provided by several observations. As reported previously by others (10Yamamoto N. Smith N.W. Maki A. Berezesky I.K. Trump B.F. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and recapitulated herein for our cell line/reporter gene system, inhibitors of Ser/Thr protein kinases, here H7 and GF-X, inhibited the activation of hsp reporter genes in response to a moderate heat shock. The inhibitors did not reduce HSF1 DNA-binding activity measured in cells harvested at the end of the heat shock period. Conversely, protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A potentiated hsp reporter gene expression induced by a moderate heat shock. Similar observations were also made with phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (11Chang N.-T. Huang L.E. Liu A.Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1436-1439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of phosphatase inhibitors was not accompanied by a significant increase in HSE DNA-binding activity.To find out whether the second regulatory event involved hyperphosphorylation of HSF1, the phosphorylation status of HSF1 in cells overexpressing HSF1 or exposed to menadione or salicylate was assessed by incorporation of [32P]phosphate or by mobility shift assay. In each case, inactive trimers were found to be underphosphorylated when compared to HSF1 from heat-shocked cells. In each case, exposure to calyculin A resulted in hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 trimers that was similar in extent to that observed in moderately to severely heat-shocked cells. This hyperphosphorylation invariably accompanied activation of the transactivation function of the HSF1 trimers. Activation by calyculin A occurred in the absence of a significant increase in HSE DNA binding activity. Thus, increased protein phosphorylation triggered the transcriptional activation of inactive HSF1 trimers. The most straightforward interpretation of these findings is that activation of the transactivation function of HSF1 depended on the phosphorylation of certain sites in the factor itself. The possibility that inducible phosphorylation of another factor(s), acting downstream from HSF1, was required for HSF1 to activate hsp genes could be excluded based on our previous identification of deletion mutants of HSF1 that are constitutively active in the absence of stress (16Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, it could not be ruled out that the second regulatory event involved a negative regulator of the HSF1 transactivation function, and that this regulator was inactivated by phosphorylation. Note that there is no evidence for the existence of such a regulator. Furthermore, that even extreme overexpression of HSF1 does not result in active factor appears to argue against a repressor-type mechanism of regulation. Nevertheless, the formal elimination of this possibility will require the identification of the residues inducibly phosphorylated in HSF1 and the demonstration that trimeric HSF1 mutated in these residues cannot be activated by calyculin A.The present study uncovered an additional, unexpected role for HSF1 hyperphosphorylation. The critical experiment involved two sets of cultures. The first set was preexposed to calyculin A, and the inhibitor remained present for the duration of the experiment, whereas the second set did not receive the inhibitor. Cultures were subjected to a brief heat shock, and HSF1 was analyzed before and immediately after heat shock as well as at two different times after the return of the cells to the control temperature. HSE DNA binding assays revealed that DNA binding activity disappeared slower in the presence than in the absence of the inhibitor. Thus, hyperphosphorylation retarded the inactivation of HSF1 DNA binding ability. Native gel electrophoresis and HSF1 blot showed that, in the absence of calyculin A, most HSF1 monomers were converted to trimers during or shortly after the heat shock, and that the trimers were quantitatively disassembled within about 2 h following the return of cells to the control temperature. In the presence of calyculin A, however, i.e. in a situation in which HSF1 was hyperphosphorylated prior to heat shock, both HSF1 trimer formation in response to heat shock and their dissociation subsequent to heat shock was retarded. The severity of inhibition was dependent on the calyculin A dosage.The observation that hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 causes inhibition of trimer formation upon heat shock may not be physiologically relevant. In our experiments, hyperphosphorylation was induced prior to the exposure of the cells to the stressful condition. Normally, trimerization of HSF1 in response to a stressful event may occur simultaneously with or may even precede induced phosphorylation of the factor (24Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). By contrast, the inhibition of the dissociation of hyperphosphorylated HSF1 trimers may well be physiologically important. It would tend to potentiate the stimulatory effect of hyperphosphorylation on the transactivation function of the factor, further increasing the accumulation of hsp mRNA and hsps.It was reported previously that exposure of cells to the amino acid analogue azetidine activates HSF1, without causing hyperphosphorylation of the factor as assessed by anti-HSF1 Western blot (5Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). This finding is in apparent conflict with the present observations and conclusions. However, there are several possible explanations for this anomaly. For example, mobility shift assays only provide information on overall changes in factor phosphorylation. They may not detect a change in phosphorylation of an individual residue that may be particularly important for factor regulation. In addition, mobility shift assays describe a property of the average HSF1 molecule and do not discriminate between active and inactive factor. Thus, the finding does not seriously detract from our observations but underscores the importance of further investigation aimed at defining the effects of individual phosphorylation events on the regulation of HSF1.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1436-1439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Erdos G. Lee Y.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These observations provided a point of departure for the present study. Using a potent protein phosphatase inhibitor, evidence was obtained that hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 trimers both increases their transcriptional activity and inhibits their dissociation. DISCUSSIONUpon heat stress, HSF1 is hyperphosphorylated mainly on Ser and Thr residues. This hyperphosphorylation shows as an increase in the apparent monomer size of HSF1 in anti-HSF1 Western blots. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of HSF1 indicates heat-induced phosphorylation of residues in at least four different peptides. Based on the results of the present study that are discussed in more detail below, phosphorylation of one or more of these residues appears to increase the activity of the transactivation function of HSF1 and to reduce the rate of HSF1 trimer dissociation.Previous observations provided convincing evidence that activation of HSF1 involves at least two regulatory events that can be separated from one another. The first event converts inactive HSF1 monomers into DNA-binding and nuclear-localized trimers. The second event activates the transactivation function of these trimers. The first event is exemplified by findings that menadione, H2O2, or salicylate induce the formation of HSF1 trimers that are transcriptionally inert (20Bruce J.L. Price B.D. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 12-15PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jurivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mouse erythroleukemia cell line has been characterized in which HSF(1) trimerizes in response to heat shock but remains unable to enhance hsp gene transcription (22Hensold J.O. Hunt C.R. Calderwood S.K. Housman D.E. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1600-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, PrPSc-infected mouse cells show normal HSF1 trimerization upon heat shock treatment but are essentially incapable of raising the rate of synthesis of hsps (23Tatzelt J. Zuo J. Voellmy R. Scott M. Hartl U. Prusiner S. Welch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 2944-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of HSF1 in human cells transfected with a functional HSF1 cDNA gene results in the accumulation of DNA-binding and nuclear-localized trimers that are unable to activate hsp reporter genes (16Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes of mutant human HSF1 containing a single substitution in the third hydrophobic repeat (E391) results in inactive HSF1 trimers (16Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Evidence for a second heat-regulated event was provided by the observation that a chimeric LexA-HSF1 protein overexpressed in human cells can be heat-activated to transcribe a LexA-CAT reporter gene. Like wild-type HSF1, overexpressed LexA-HSF1 is found in a DNA-binding form in human cells. Thus, heat shock triggered a second regulatory event, i.e. the conversion of inactive to active trimeric factor. Similar findings were made in the frog oocyte in which a LexA-HSF1 protein containing the E391 mutation was a transcriptionally inactive trimer that could be activated by heat shock. Finally, the transcriptional activity of a GAL4-HSF1 chimera lacking sequences required for trimerization could be enhanced by extreme heat shock (18Green M. Schuetz T.J. Sullivan E.K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3354-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Newton E.M. Knauf U. Green M. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Evidence that hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 does not play a role in the first regulatory event is provided by several observations. As reported previously by others (10Yamamoto N. Smith N.W. Maki A. Berezesky I.K. Trump B.F. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and recapitulated herein for our cell line/reporter gene system, inhibitors of Ser/Thr protein kinases, here H7 and GF-X, inhibited the activation of hsp reporter genes in response to a moderate heat shock. The inhibitors did not reduce HSF1 DNA-binding activity measured in cells harvested at the end of the heat shock period. Conversely, protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A potentiated hsp reporter gene expression induced by a moderate heat shock. Similar observations were also made with phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (11Chang N.-T. Huang L.E. Liu A.Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1436-1439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of phosphatase inhibitors was not accompanied by a significant increase in HSE DNA-binding activity.To find out whether the second regulatory event involved hyperphosphorylation of HSF1, the phosphorylation status of HSF1 in cells overexpressing HSF1 or exposed to menadione or salicylate was assessed by incorporation of [32P]phosphate or by mobility shift assay. In each case, inactive trimers were found to be underphosphorylated when compared to HSF1 from heat-shocked cells. In each case, exposure to calyculin A resulted in hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 trimers that was similar in extent to that observed in moderately to severely heat-shocked cells. This hyperphosphorylation invariably accompanied activation of the transactivation function of the HSF1 trimers. Activation by calyculin A occurred in the absence of a significant increase in HSE DNA binding activity. Thus, increased protein phosphorylation triggered the transcriptional activation of inactive HSF1 trimers. The most straightforward interpretation of these findings is that activation of the transactivation function of HSF1 depended on the phosphorylation of certain sites in the factor itself. The possibility that inducible phosphorylation of another factor(s), acting downstream from HSF1, was required for HSF1 to activate hsp genes could be excluded based on our previous identification of deletion mutants of HSF1 that are constitutively active in the absence of stress (16Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, it could not be ruled out that the second regulatory event involved a negative regulator of the HSF1 transactivation function, and that this regulator was inactivated by phosphorylation. Note that there is no evidence for the existence of such a regulator. Furthermore, that even extreme overexpression of HSF1 does not result in active factor appears to argue against a repressor-type mechanism of regulation. Nevertheless, the formal elimination of this possibility will require the identification of the residues inducibly phosphorylated in HSF1 and the demonstration that trimeric HSF1 mutated in these residues cannot be activated by calyculin A.The present study uncovered an additional, unexpected role for HSF1 hyperphosphorylation. The critical experiment involved two sets of cultures. The first set was preexposed to calyculin A, and the inhibitor remained present for the duration of the experiment, whereas the second set did not receive the inhibitor. Cultures were subjected to a brief heat shock, and HSF1 was analyzed before and immediately after heat shock as well as at two different times after the return of the cells to the control temperature. HSE DNA binding assays revealed that DNA binding activity disappeared slower in the presence than in the absence of the inhibitor. Thus, hyperphosphorylation retarded the inactivation of HSF1 DNA binding ability. Native gel electrophoresis and HSF1 blot showed that, in the absence of calyculin A, most HSF1 monomers were converted to trimers during or shortly after the heat shock, and that the trimers were quantitatively disassembled within about 2 h following the return of cells to the control temperature. In the presence of calyculin A, however, i.e. in a situation in which HSF1 was hyperphosphorylated prior to heat shock, both HSF1 trimer formation in response to heat shock and their dissociation subsequent to heat shock was retarded. The severity of inhibition was dependent on the calyculin A dosage.The observation that hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 causes inhibition of trimer formation upon heat shock may not be physiologically relevant. In our experiments, hyperphosphorylation was induced prior to the exposure of the cells to the stressful condition. Normally, trimerization of HSF1 in response to a stressful event may occur simultaneously with or may even precede induced phosphorylation of the factor (24Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). By contrast, the inhibition of the dissociation of hyperphosphorylated HSF1 trimers may well be physiologically important. It would tend to potentiate the stimulatory effect of hyperphosphorylation on the transactivation function of the factor, further increasing the accumulation of hsp mRNA and hsps.It was reported previously that exposure of cells to the amino acid analogue azetidine activates HSF1, without causing hyperphosphorylation of the factor as assessed by anti-HSF1 Western blot (5Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). This finding is in apparent conflict with the present observations and conclusions. However, there are several possible explanations for this anomaly. For example, mobility shift assays only provide information on overall changes in factor phosphorylation. They may not detect a change in phosphorylation of an individual residue that may be particularly important for factor regulation. In addition, mobility shift assays describe a property of the average HSF1 molecule and do not discriminate between active and inactive factor. Thus, the finding does not seriously detract from our observations but underscores the importance of further investigation aimed at defining the effects of individual phosphorylation events on the regulation of HSF1.

Surface expression was examined by modifying surface receptors via treatment of intact neurons with either the protease chymotrypsin or the cross-linking reagent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, followed by quantification of anti-NR1 and anti-NR2B Western blot immunostaining. These studies revealed that only 40-50% of total NR1 immunoreactivity is found at the cell surface, as compared to more than 90% of total NR2B immunoreactivity. Metabolic labeling of the cultures with 32P revealed that NR2 subunits are highly phosphorylated under basal conditions, whereas basal phosphorylation of NR1 subunits is barely detectable. Following stimulation of the cultures with glutamate/glycine or phorbol esters, NR1 phosphorylation was found to be enhanced by 3-5-fold, whereas phosphorylation of NR2 subunits was enhanced by less than 2-fold. To determine whether the difference in the basal NR1 versus NR2 phosphorylation could be due to tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2, phosphoamino acid analyses of NR2 were performed.

In enteric bacteria, the LPS molecule comprises a hydrophobic lipid A portion, which forms the outer leaflet of the outer membrane, a core oligosaccharide, and an O-side-chain polysaccharide. The O polysaccharide varies in structure from strain to strain, giving rise to unique antigenic epitopes (O antigens). In the genus Klebsiella, there exists a family of structurally related galactose-containing O polysaccharides. These are based on a backbone structure consisting of a disaccharide O-repeat unit [â3)-Î²-D-Galf-(1â3)-Î±-D-Galp-(1â] known as D-galactan I (1Whitfield C. Richards J.C. Perry M.B. Clarke B.R. MacLean L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1420-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Variations in O antigens arise from addition of side-chain Î±-D-Galp (2Kelly R.F. Perry M.B. MacLean L.L. Whitfield C.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Many of these microorganisms are important pathogens, and, for some, current therapies are limited. This observation, together with the absence of Galf residues in human glycoconjugates has fueled interest in the potential of generating novel therapeutic compounds directed against reactions involved in the formation of Galf precursors (38McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).In the prototype system in K. pneumoniae O1, D-galactan I biosynthesis is directed by enzymes encoded by six genes in the chromosomal rfb locus. The polymer is synthesized in the cytoplasm by RfbCDEF activities and is then transported across the plasma membrane by a process involving an ATP-binding cassette (ABC-2) transporter, where RfbA is the transmembrane component and RfbB contains the consensus ATP-binding motifs (39Bronner D. Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The synthesis of D-galactan I is initiated on a âprimerâ comprising undecaprenyl pyrophosphoryl N-acetylglucosamine. The primer is formed by the activity of the Rfe protein which appears to be an UDP-GlcNAc:undecaprenylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase (40Meier-Dieter U. Barr K. Starman R. Hatch L. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 746-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RfbF is a bifunctional galactosyl transferase, which forms the disaccharide [â3)-Î²-D-Galf-(1â3)-Î±-D-Galp-1(â] on the primer (41Clarke B.A. Bronner D. Keenleyside W.J. Severn W.B. Richards J.C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5411-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The details of the subsequent polymerization reaction(s) have not yet been resolved.The precursor for Galp residues is UDP-Galp (42Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4614-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), formed by the action of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, encoded by the galE gene in the galactose operon (43Weikert M.J. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Early studies on the biosynthesis of the T1 antigen in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (44Nikaido H. Sarvas M. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 1073-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sarvas M. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that Galf precursors were derived from Galp at the level of UDP-linked sugars. The Galf precursor for a galactofuranosyl-containing polysaccharide in Penicillium charlesii was also proposed to be a UDP-linked derivative (46Trejo A.G. Chittenden G.J.F. Buchanan J.G. Baddiley J. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 637-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). More recently, the product of orf6, an enzyme encoded by the cryptic rfb locus in E. coli K-12 strains (47Stevenson G. Neal B. Liu D. Hobbs M. Packer N.H. Batley M. Redmond J.W. Lindquist L. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4144-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), was shown to have UDP-galactopyranose mutase (EC 5.4.99.9) activity, capable of the reversible formation of UDP-Galf from UDP-Galp (48Nassau P.M. Martin S.L. Brown R.E. Weston A. Monsey D. McNeil M.R. Duncan K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The product UDP-Galf was predicted from degradation products and this compound has not been isolated and fully characterized in an intact state.This paper reports the cloning, expression, and purification of RfbDKPO1 from K. pneumoniae O1. We show that the enzyme has UDP-galactopyranose mutase activity but differs in several important aspects from the homologue from E. coli K-12. In addition, we report the isolation and first complete chemical characterization of intact UDP-GalfDISCUSSIONGalactofuranosyl residues are found in a growing number of surface glycoconjugates from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as protozoa and fungi. These include well documented pathogens of humans and livestock. In bacteria (this work, and Refs. 44Nikaido H. Sarvas M. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 1073-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sarvas M.

J. 1970; 117: 637-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the biosynthetic precursor for Galf residues is believed to be UDP-Galf Galactofuranosyl-containing glycoconjugates have not been reported in humans so far, which makes UDP-Galf formation an interesting target for novel therapeutic compounds (38McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, development of strategies for inhibitors has been limited by the lack of fundamental information regarding the biosynthesis of galactofuranosyl residues. Galactocarolose, a Î²-D-(1â5)-linked polygalactofuranosid produced by P. charlesii, was the first polysaccharide found to contain galactofuranosyl residues (34Gorin P.A.J. Spencer J.F.T. Can. J. Chem. 1959; 37: 499-502Crossref Google Scholar, 67Haworth W.N. Raistrick H. Stacey M. Biochem. J. 1937; 31: 640-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trejo et al. (46Trejo A.G. Chittenden G.J.F. Buchanan J.G. Baddiley J. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 637-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) isolated a nucleotide sugar formed in cell-free enzyme preparations of P. charlesii, which was capable of acting as a donor of galactofuranosyl residues in the biosynthesis of a galactofuranosyl-containing polymer. Based on chemical analysis of the reaction products obtained by acid and alkaline hydrolosis as well as periodate oxidation, Trejo et al. (46Trejo A.G. Chittenden G.J.F. Buchanan J.G. Baddiley J. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 637-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) predicted that the sugar nucleotide is UDP-Galf More recently, Nassau et al. (48Nassau P.M. Martin S.L. Brown R.E. Weston A. Monsey D. McNeil M.R. Duncan K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cloned the glf gene of E. coli and showed that it encodes UDP-galactopyranose mutase (EC 5.4.99.9). Nassau et al. (48Nassau P.M. Martin S.L. Brown R.E. Weston A. Monsey D. McNeil M.R. Duncan K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that the reaction product of the UDP-galactopyranose mutase reaction is UDP-Galf based on HPLC analysis of the sugar 1-phosphate obtained after phosphodiesterase treatment of the reaction product. The modification of an HPAEC procedure, to give a method that separates UDP-Galp from UDP-Galf, allowed us for the first time to purify milligram quantities of UDP-Galf and to unequivocally prove by NMR the structure to be uridine 5â²-(trihydrogen diphosphate) Pâ²-Î±-D-galactofuranosyl ester. This will provide an essential reagent for biochemical analyses of synthetic systems for galactofuranosyl-containing glycoconjugates.The data presented here establish that RfbDKPO1 catalyzes the interconversion of UDP-Galp and UDP-Galf The LPS profiles of E. coli K-12 strains containing pWQ70 and pWQ71 clearly demonstrated that Glf (48Nassau P.M. Martin S.L. Brown R.E. Weston A. Monsey D. McNeil M.R. Duncan K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of E. coli can complement the rfbDKPO1 deletion in pWQ70. Glf and RfbDKPO1 are therefore functionally equivalent. Although the K. pneumoniae RfbDKPO1 protein shows 37.5% identity to Glf of E. coli, the two proteins do exhibit remarkable differences. Glf has been reported to be relatively unstable, resulting in complete loss of activity after storage of the purified protein at 4Â°C for >24 h (48Nassau P.M. Martin S.L. Brown R.E. Weston A. Monsey D. McNeil M.R. Duncan K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, RfbDKPO1 can be stored at 4Â°C for periods in excess of 1-2 weeks without significant loss of activity (data not shown). Moreover, no cofactor requirement other than FAD has been reported for Glf, while RfbDKPO1 has an absolute requirement for NADH or NADPH. These differences are difficult to explain. One possibility is that the binding constants for NADH (NADPH) are different in both proteins. Alternatively, the differences may be a result of the purification procedure used. Cibacron Blue 3GA used in the purification procedure reported here is thought to bind to NAD binding sites. Consequently, binding of the enzyme to this resin may displace the essential cofactor. Analysis of the predicted sequence of both proteins revealed a ADP-binding Î²Î±Î²-fold at its N terminus, which could be involved in binding FAD or NAD. The motif in K. pneumoniae differs at Gly-19 from the fingerprint. However, the known structure of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, which has a glycine at the same position (position 15 of the fingerprint), demonstrates that peptides with a glycine at this position can form a functional Î²Î±Î² unit (68Wierenga R.K. Drenth J. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The presence of FAD in the purified Glf protein has been reported (48Nassau P.M. Martin S.L. Brown R.E. Weston A. Monsey D. McNeil M.R. Duncan K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although we have not analyzed this cofactor in RfbDKPO1, the yellow color of the pure protein is consistent with its containing FAD. Gel filtration of the RfbDKPO1 protein on Superose 12 revealed a molecular weight of 92,000 for the native protein. The possible dimerization of Glf has not been investigated.Little is known about the mechanism of the UDP-galactopyranose mutase (NAD(P)H-requiring) reaction. Stevenson et al. (47Stevenson G. Neal B. Liu D. Hobbs M. Packer N.H. Batley M. Redmond J.W. Lindquist L. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4144-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) suggested that the reaction may proceed via a 2-keto intermediate. Since in our hands the UDP-galactopyranose mutase reaction shows an absolute requirement for NADH or NADPH and was found to be inactive with NAD or NADP, an alternative is that the first step of the reaction may be a reduction step, although there is no net oxidation/reduction in the interconversion of UDP-Galp and UDP-Galf The stability of the RfbDKPO1 protein and the possibility to synthesize and purify larger quantities of UDP-Galf will facilitate a detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism and determination of the protein structure.Note Added in ProofWhile this manuscript was in press, a report by others independently confirmed the nature and structure of UDP-Galf as the product of the UDP-galactopyranose mutase reaction (Lee, R., Monsey, D., Weston, A., Duncan, K., Rithner, C., and McNeil, M. (1996) Anal. Biochem. 242, 1-7). INTRODUCTIONLipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In enteric bacteria, the LPS molecule comprises a hydrophobic lipid A portion, which forms the outer leaflet of the outer membrane, a core oligosaccharide, and an O-side-chain polysaccharide. The O polysaccharide varies in structure from strain to strain, giving rise to unique antigenic epitopes (O antigens). In the genus Klebsiella, there exists a family of structurally related galactose-containing O polysaccharides. These are based on a backbone structure consisting of a disaccharide O-repeat unit [â3)-Î²-D-Galf-(1â3)-Î±-D-Galp-(1â] known as D-galactan I (1Whitfield C. Richards J.C. Perry M.B. Clarke B.R. MacLean L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1420-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Variations in O antigens arise from addition of side-chain Î±-D-Galp (2Kelly R.F. Perry M.B. MacLean L.L. Whitfield C. J. Endotox. Res. 1995; 2: 131-140Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and O-acetyl (2Kelly R.F. Perry M.B. MacLean L.L. Whitfield C. J. Endotox.

This observation, together with the absence of Galf residues in human glycoconjugates has fueled interest in the potential of generating novel therapeutic compounds directed against reactions involved in the formation of Galf precursors (38McNeil M.R.

The polymer is synthesized in the cytoplasm by RfbCDEF activities and is then transported across the plasma membrane by a process involving an ATP-binding cassette (ABC-2) transporter, where RfbA is the transmembrane component and RfbB contains the consensus ATP-binding motifs (39Bronner D. Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The synthesis of D-galactan I is initiated on a âprimerâ comprising undecaprenyl pyrophosphoryl N-acetylglucosamine. The primer is formed by the activity of the Rfe protein which appears to be an UDP-GlcNAc:undecaprenylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase (40Meier-Dieter U. Barr K. Starman R. Hatch L. Rick P.D.

RfbF is a bifunctional galactosyl transferase, which forms the disaccharide [â3)-Î²-D-Galf-(1â3)-Î±-D-Galp-1(â] on the primer (41Clarke B.A. Bronner D. Keenleyside W.J. Severn W."

The mechanism(s) of transcriptional regulation conferred by this region, however, are poorly understood. We screened in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a library of random mutants in the enh2 region of a constitutive glucocorticoid receptor derivative and isolated a series of multiply substituted receptors that are specifically defective in transcriptional activation. Although many substitutions in this area were tolerated, three amino acid substitutions (E219K, F220L, and W234R) within a 16-amino acid region were sufficient to disrupt the enh2 transcriptional activation function both in yeast and in mammalian cells. Although this region is rich in acidic residues, the conserved tryptophan at position 234 appears to be a more critical feature for enh2 activity; hydrophobic but not charged residues were tolerated at this position. Notably, the mutants uncoupled the activation and repression functions of enh2, as the activation defective isolates remained competent for repression of AP-1 at the composite response element plfG.

In animal cells, the effects of steroid hormones on the genome are mediated by members of the intracellular receptor superfamily, a vast collection of proteins endowed with the capacity to regulate the transcription of an equally diverse array of target genes during development and in response to specific physiological and pathological cues (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. SchÃtz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is responsible for the effects of glucocorticoids and constitutes a prototype for this family of transcriptional regulators (3Yamamoto K.R. The Harvey Lectures. 1996; Google Scholar, 4Beato M. Herrlich P. SchÃtz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding to its C-terminal region, GR is recruited to gene enhancers and promoters via a central zinc-binding region that is capable of recognizing specific DNA sequences termed glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). Once in the vicinity of a promoter, the receptor can mediate either stimulatory or inhibitory influences on transcription (5Yamamoto K.R. Pearce D. Thomas J. Miner J.N. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation.Cold Spring Harbor Press. 1992; : 1169-1192Google Scholar, 6Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R.

Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). The direction of the effect appears to be dictated by the nature of the response element recognized by the receptor and by interactions with other sequence-specific transcription factors (8Miner J.N. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 12: 2491-2501Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R.

In contrast to the relatively high amino acid sequence conservation in the zinc-binding and ligand-binding domains, the N-terminal regions of intracellular receptors are divergent both in size and sequence (11Segraves W.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 225-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Detera-Wadleigh S.D. Fanning T.G. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1994; 3: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This implies that the N-terminal regions may contribute strongly to the class specificity of otherwise closely related receptors. Deletion of the C-terminal ligand-binding regions of steroid receptors yields constitutive (hormone-independent) transcriptional activators, implying that the N-terminal regions harbor autonomous transcriptional activation functions (13Godowski P.J. Rusconi S. Miesfeld R. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1987; 325: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Insertion and deletion analysis (14Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M.

Science. 1988; 241: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) circumscribed the activation function (termed enh2 or Ï-1) to a region flanked by amino acids 108 and 317 in the rat GR. A prevalence of negatively charged residues, together with cross synergy and interference assays, led to the classification of enh2 as a so-called âacidic activation domainâ (17Tasset D. Tora L. Fromental C. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1177-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). As with other activators, however, the features of this region essential for transcriptional activation have been difficult to define (16Godowski P.J. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18Miesfeld R. Sakai D. Inoue A. Schena M. Godowski P.J. Yamamoto K.R. Ringold G.

Science. 1987; 236: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition to its transcriptional stimulation activity, GR has the potential to inhibit transcription driven by other activators, such as AP-1 (6Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 7Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Park K.-K. Cato A.C.B. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). For example, at plfG, a composite GRE from the proliferin gene, transcriptional activation by the cJun-cFos heterodimeric form of AP-1 is repressed by the hormone-bound GR (5Yamamoto K.R. Pearce D. Thomas J. Miner J.N. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation.Cold Spring Harbor Press. 1992; : 1169-1192Google Scholar, 6Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R.

Exploiting the inability of the closely related mineralocorticoid receptor to repress in this context, Pearce and Yamamoto (22Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 259: 1161-1165Crossref Scopus (400) Google Scholar) generated receptor chimeras that demonstrated a requirement for the N-terminal region of GR for repression from plfG. Thus, a single region of GR harbors determinants for transcriptional activation and repression. The mechanisms by which GR achieves activation or repression are unknown. It has been suggested, however, that both chromatin-dependent and -independent mechanisms of activation are at work. That is, transcriptional activation by GR expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the Swi1, Swi2, and Swi3 proteins (23Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), part of a multiprotein Swi/Snf complex that may be involved in chromatin remodeling (24Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Similarly, in human cells, GR activity is potentiated by a mammalian Swi2 homolog (25Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Moreover, a screen for genomic mutations causing loss of GR function in yeast yielded swp73, an additional member the Swi/Snf complex (26Cairns B.R. Levinson R.S. Yamamoto K.R. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2131-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in vitro studies with ânakedâ DNA templates suggest that the enh2 region of GR may stimulate transcription by a mechanism independent of chromatin (27Freedman L.P. Yoshinaga S.K. Vanderbilt J.N. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1989; 245: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Studies with various activators suggest that activation may involve interactions with components of the basal transcription machinery either directly or via accessory factors or coactivators (28Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 29Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev.

Biochemical- and interaction-based assays have yielded several molecules that physically interact with particular steroid receptors, including GR (31Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L.

Most of those factors interact with the receptor C-terminal region, which appear also to carry transcriptional regulatory activities. The functional significance and role in transcriptional activation for most of these interactions, however, remain largely unknown. Efforts to elucidate the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the N-terminal region of GR would be aided by point mutants that distinguish activation from repression âsurfaces,â and that could be used to test the functional significance of physical interactions with potential targets. One approach to the characterization of activation domains has been to mutate frequently represented amino acid residues, such as glutamine, proline, or those with acidic side chains. This strategy, however, may fail to identify residues important for function (42Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 43Gill G.

Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a genetic approach in S. cerevisiae in which we screened a large set of rat GR derivatives carrying multiple substitutions in enh2 for mutants that are specifically defective in transcriptional activation. The yeast strains W303-1a (MAT a ade2-1 trp1-1 ura3-1 leu2-3, 112; his3-11, 15 can1-100) and its isogenic MAT Î± counterpart (W303-1b) were used for receptor activity and screening. Yeast strains were grown in minimal medium with amino acids and 2% glucose or galactose (45Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Plasmid selection was maintained by culturing in medium lacking the appropriate amino acid(s). The CEN/ARS, galactose-inducible expression plasmid, pRS314(G) consists of a 670-base pair EcoRI (blunted)/BamHI fragment containing the yeast Gal 1-10 promoter region ligated into the SpeI(blunted)/BamHI sites of the plasmid pRS314 (46Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate pRS314(G)â²N525, the coding region of rat GR amino acids 1 to 525 (13Godowski P.J. Rusconi S. Miesfeld R. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1987; 325: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) was placed downstream of the Gal 1 promoter as a BamHI fragment, and some restriction sites in the 3â² polylinker region were eliminated by digesting with EcoRI and KpnI, treating with T4 DNA polymerase, and re-ligating. Digestion of pRS314(G)â²N525 with NcoI and BSP120-I, repair of the termini to blunt ends with T4 DNA polymerase, and religation produced a precise deletion of amino acids 108 to 317. The CEN/ARS plasmid pHCA N795 expresses wild-type full-length GR from the constitutive yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. The 2 Î¼ reporter plasmid pÎ´s26X consists of a minimal CYC-1 promoter linked to three copies of a GRE derived from the tyrosine aminotransferase gene driving the expression of the E. coli LacZ gene (47Schena M. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A library of mutants targeted to the region between amino acids 108 and 317 of rat GR was constructed by the polymerase chain reaction. The oligonucleotide primers 5â²-ATCAAAAGCCGTTTCACTGTCC-3â² and 5â²-TGTCCTCCAGAGGTACTCAAAC-3â² were used to amplify a 746-base pair region of the rat GR under mutagenic conditions: 67 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 16 mM (NH4)2SO4, 6.1 mM MgCl2, 0.17 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mMÎ²-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 0.2 mM dATP, and 1 mM remaining deoxynucleotide triphosphates. The resulting product was digested with NcoI and ApaI (residues 108 to 317), ligated to pRS314(G)â²N525 cut with the same enzymes, and transformed into DH5Î± cells. After plating, an estimated 6 Ã 104 transformants were harvested for plasmid preparation. Limited sequence analysis of random clones indicated an overall mutation rate of approximately 2% at the nucleotide level. For screening, W303-1b cells harboring the full-length receptor expression plasmid pHCA N795 and the reporter plasmid pÎ´s26X were transformed with the mutant library and plated in selective medium. Transformants (â¼1.7 Ã 103) were replica-plated three times onto selective media containing: (a) 2% galactose; (b) 2% glucose and 10 Î¼M deoxycorticosterone; or (c) galactose and deoxycorticosterone. Receptor activity was assessed by an agar overlay procedure as described (48Kralli A. Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4701-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Colonies displaying a decreased constitutive receptor activity compared to the WT in galactose plates (light blue color) but maintaining WT activity of the full-length receptor in the presence of ligand were identified. The isolates were then tested for the level of expression of the mutant receptor by immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody BuGR-2, which recognizes a nonmutagenized epitope on the receptor (49Gametchu B. Harrison R.W. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Plasmids rescued from 16 isolates displaying GR expression levels similar to the WT protein were sequenced across the mutagenized region and further characterized. In all cases, the phenotype was confirmed to be plasmid-borne by retransformation and retesting. To segregate the mutations present in individual mutants, plasmids were digested with different pairs of enzymes (NcoI, SalI, NsiI, EcoN1, BglII, and ApaI). The appropriate fragments containing the desired region were then inserted into pRS314(G)â²N525 cleaved with the same enzyme pairs. In some cases, individual amino acid changes were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the method of Kunkel (50Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) and confirmed by sequencing. Yeast cultures were grown to saturation in glucose-selective media (200 Î¼l) in 96-well microtiter plates under constant agitation at 30Â°C. To prevent evaporation, the plates were maintained in a humidified environment. Cultures were diluted 1:40 in fresh galactose (2%) selective medium and grown for an additional 14-16 h. Cell density was determined as absorbance at 650 nm. Cells were permeabilized in microtiter plates by mixing 10 Î¼l of each culture with an equal volume of twice concentrated reaction buffer (120 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, and 20 mMÎ²-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 5% CHAPS and incubated 5 min at 25Â°C under constant agitation. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 180 Î¼l of 0.5 mM chlorophenol red-Î²-D-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) in reaction buffer prewarmed at 37Â°C. Progress of the reaction was monitored at 37Â°C in a temperature-controlled microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) by measuring the difference of the absorbances at 550 nm (test) and 650 nm (reference) at 2-min intervals. Activity units are defined as shown in Equation 1. Î´OD550-650 is the rate of change in absorbance difference between 550 and 650 nm (in mOD/min), OD650 is the absorbance of the cultures at 650 nm in the microtiter plate, cv is the volume of culture used to determine OD650 (200 Î¼l standard), and sv is the volume of culture used for the assay (10-Î¼l standard). This simple and high throughput assay is similar in sensitivity and reproducibility to the standard Miller assay (51Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1972; : 352-355Google Scholar). F9 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME H16, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. The reporter plasmids pÎ´TAT3-Luc and plfG3-Luc contain three copies of the tyrosine aminotransferase (52Jantzen H.M. StrÃ¤hle U. Gloss B. Stewart F. Schmid W. Boshart M. Miksicek R. SchÃtz G. Cell. 1987; 49: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and proliferin (6Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) GREs, respectively, upstream of a minimal Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (adh â33 to +53) and the luciferase gene. The reporter plasmid pMMTV-LTR-Luc was constructed by ligating a 1.44-kilobase PstI fragment from MMTV LTR (C3H, â1183 to +256) that had been rendered blunt with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase at the SmaI site of pGL-3 Basic (Promega Corp.). The plasmids p6RGR (16Godowski P.J. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), p6RGR Î´108-317 (9Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and p6RGR N525 (16Godowski P.J. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) allow the expression of full-length GR, and deletions of amino acids 108 to 317 and 526 to 795, respectively. To construct mammalian expression vectors for the mutants identified in yeast, the mutant region was transferred as an NcoI/ApaI fragment to p6RGR N525. Deletion of amino acids 108-317 was achieved in the same way as for the yeast vector (see above). Full-length versions of these plasmids were obtained by ligating a 1501-base pair PstI/NgoMI fragment from p6RGR containing the remaining GR coding sequence into the same sites of the corresponding N525 derivatives. The above plasmids as well as the empty (pS6R), c-Jun (pRSV-Jun), cFos (pRSV-Fos)(53), and Î²-galactosidase (p6RÎ²-gal)(22) expression vectors are derivatives of p65 in which the RSV promoter drives the expression of the corresponding gene. Cells from subconfluent 100-mm dishes were diluted 10-fold and seeded in 60-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfection by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (9Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Following overnight exposure of the cells to the DNA-calcium phosphate mixture, cells were glycerol-shocked (15% glycerol in DME H16 for 2 min), washed once in phosphate-buffered saline lacking calcium and magnesium, and incubated an additional 24 h in fresh medium. In the case of experiments involving hormone treatment, the final 24-h incubation was in medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum in the presence of dexamethasone (0.1 Î¼M) or vehicle (0.1% ethanol). In addition to the expression plasmids indicated in the figure legends, all transfections included 2 Î¼g of reporter plasmid and 0.25 Î¼g of the p6RÎ²-gal control plasmid. For extract preparation, phosphate-buffered saline washed cells were lysed (15 min at 25Â°C) in 100 Î¼l of reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (5 min, 1000 Ã g, 4Â°C). Luciferase activity was determined as described (9Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Values were normalized to the Î²-galactosidase activity present in the extract, as assessed by the rate of hydrolysis of chlorophenol red-Î²-D-galactopyranoside under the same conditions described above for yeast cells. On the basis of the Î²-galactosidase activities observed, no significant alterations in the activity of the RSV promoter were detected under the conditions used. Glucocorticoid receptor derivatives lacking the C-terminal hormone-binding region function as ligand-independent constitutive activators in mammalian cells (13Godowski P.J. Rusconi S. Miesfeld R. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1987; 325: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the ability of N525, a truncated rat GR lacking the C-terminal 270 amino acids, to activate transcription in S. cerevisiae (47Schena M. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) to screen for substitution mutants between amino acids 108 and 317 that are defective in transcriptional activation. Given the apparent functional redundancy of most activation domains and prior difficulties in further delineating the transcriptional activation function(s) present within this region, the library was designed to contain multiple base pair substitutions per molecule (12 on average). Using this library, mutants with defects in transcriptional activity (<50-70% of WT) appeared at a high frequency (â¼20%). None appeared to interfere with the WT full-length receptor. To avoid inactive derivatives truncated at nonsense mutations, we chose to analyze 50 mutants displaying low but detectable levels of activity. Such mutants were still abundant but less frequent (â¼2.5%). After confirming that the phenotype was plasmid-borne, 16 mutants that are expressed at levels comparable to WT (see âExperimental Proceduresâ; data not shown) were sequenced over the entire mutagenized region. As shown in Fig. 1A, these mutants display activation defects ranging from mild (70% of WT) to severe (â¼5% of WT). Analysis of the activity of these mutants using various reporter constructs indicated that the phenotype is independent of the number of simple GRE-binding sites (one, two, or three), their exact sequence, location with respect to the transcription start site, or whether they were episomal or chromosomal (data not shown). When these mutants were analyzed in mammalian cells (Fig. 1B), their phenotypes appeared to be somewhat accentuated, whereas their rank order was similar, implying that activation was similarly affected in mammalian cells and in yeast. Interestingly, certain mutants were disproportionately defective in mammalian cells (e.g. see mutant enh29). This effect does not appear to reflect the higher temperature at which mammalian cells are maintained (37Â°C versus 30Â°C), because the pattern of activity in yeast was similar at the two temperatures (data not shown). Sequence analysis revealed that the mutation frequency in this panel of mutants is 2.5 and 4.9% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, yielding an average of 10.3 amino acid changes per molecule. The spatial distribution of the mutations revealed no apparent clustering, either by visual inspection or by comparison to a theoretical set of random mutants computer generated to have the same overall mutation frequency as the actual mutant set (data not shown). An inverse relationship was observed between transcriptional activation and the number of amino acid changes (insets of Fig. 1). On average, about four mutations were required for a 2-fold decrease in activity, and an order of magnitude decrease was associated with derivatives carrying perhaps 10 or more mutations. Although this may imply that the genetic target is large or that the underlying function may be redundant within enh2, it is also possible that the phenotype observed in these highly mutagenized isolates might be conferred by only a subset of the amino acid changes that they incurred. As a first step to determine which mutations were responsible for the phenotype, we transferred subregions from five of the mutants, each carrying 12-16 mutations, into an otherwise wild-type N525 background. As seen in Fig. 2, the phenotypes of the analyzed mutants appeared to be contributed by mutations in enh2 subregion II, between amino acids 180 and 237. Notably, the 10-20-fold activation defects of mutants enh220 and enh230 could be fully accounted for by five mutations within their respective subregion II. In contrast, subregions I and III of each mutant contained similar densities and types of changes, but neither contributed to the phenotype. Subregion II overlaps a segment of human GR (corresponding to amino acids 208-248 of rat GR) that has been proposed to contain an activation function based on loss-of-function deletions of receptor fragment fusions to the LexA DNA-binding domain (54Dahlman-Wright K.

A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); two insertions within this region that compromise transcriptional activation have also been reported (15GiguÃ¨re V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of subregion II in eight strongly affected mutants (Fig. 3) revealed that a unique tryptophan residue, Trp234, was mutated to arginine in five cases, whereas it was unaltered in eight mutants with weaker phenotypes (data not shown). We infer that Trp234 might be a particularly important residue for enh2-mediated activation.Fig. 3Sequence comparison of subregion II of the eight most affected mutants. Top, diagram of the primary structure of GR. The mutagenized region and the DNA-binding domain are shown in black and cross-hatch, respectively.

A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The ability to phosphorylate this substrate is not restricted to members of the PKC family. MARCKS is predominantly phosphorylated on serine (S) residues (in an order Ser-152 > Ser-156 > Ser-163) (10Herget T. Oehrlein S.A. Pappin D.C. Rozengurt E. Parker P.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in a PKC-dependent fashion, but can also be phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues by proline-directed protein kinases cdc2 and tau protein kinase II (11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yamamoto H. Futosi A. Ono T. Tashima K. Okumura E. Yamada K. Hisanaga S. Fukunaga K. Kishimoto T. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MARCKS is an acidic filamentous actin cross-linking protein which is targeted to the plasma membrane by its amino-terminal, myristoylated membrane-binding domain. This specific interaction positions the substrate close to PKC, facilitating its efficient phosphorylation. One of the striking features of MARCKS is its phosphorylation-dependent translocation from the membrane to the cytosol (8Rosen A. Keenan K.F. Thelen M. Nairn A.C. Aderem A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consequently, cytosolic MARCKS is not further cross-linking actin filaments. It has also been proposed that non-phosphorylated MARCKS complexes calmodulin resulting in a reduction of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent signaling mechanisms and thereby blocking the entry of cells into the cell cycle (13Herget T. Broad S. Rozengurt E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In murine macrophages, immunoreactive MARCKS protein was found in clusters at the interface of the substratum with pseudopodia and filopodia, where it is colocalized with other PKC substrates of actin cytoskeleton such as vinculin and talin (14Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1991; 351: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). MARCKS is also highly concentrated in presynaptic junctions and is phosphorylated in a PKC-dependent manner when synaptosomes are depolarized (15Wu W.S. Walaas S.J. Sihra T.S. Aderem A.A. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5249-5253Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Wang J.K.T. Walaas S.J. Sihra T.S. Aderem A.A. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2253-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that MARCKS cycles between the plasma membrane and Lamp-1 positive lysosomes in fibroblasts in a PKC-dependent manner (17Allen L-A.H. Aderem A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In vitro studies demonstrate that conventional PKC-Î±, novel PKC-Î´ and nPKC-Îµ, but not atypical PKC-Î¶ phosphorylate partially purified recombinant MARCKS protein (10Herget T. Oehrlein S.A. Pappin D.C. Rozengurt E. Parker P.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Fujise A. Mizuno K. Ueda Y. Osada S. Hirai S. Takayanagi A. Shimizu N. Owada M.K. Nakajima H. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 31642-31648Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MARCKS in intact cells has been employed as an indicator for activation of PKC, however, which PKC isoform phosphorylates MARCKS in intact cells is still unknown. Importantly, MARCKS gene knockout experiments (9Stumpo D.J. Bock C.B. Tuttle J.S. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated a dramatic genetic deficiency in mouse forebrain development concerning the importance of this protein in perinatal signal transduction. Therefore, PKC isoenzyme-specific MARCKS phosphorylation in living mouse cells was tested. Conventional cPKC-Î±, novel nPKC-Îµ, novel nPKC-Î·, and atypical aPKC-Î» isoforms have been selected as representatives of the three PKC subfamilies. In order to identify the PKC isoenzyme-specific functions, we investigated MARCKS phosphorylation following: 1) expression of transdominant negative (DN) PKC mutants (19Baier-Bitterlich G.

For comparative purposes, the PKC-selective bisindolylmaleimide GF109203X was used for in vitro and in vivo PKC inhibition studies.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and PlasmidsDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), geneticin (G-418), and gentamycin were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Fetal calf serum and L-glutamine were purchased from Schoeller Pharma (Vienna, Austria). Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phosphatidyl-L-Î±-serine (PtdSer), leupeptin, and aprotinin were purchased from Sigma (Vienna, Austria). Protein A-Sepharose was obtained from Pharmacia (Vienna, Austria). GF109203X I is a product of Calbiochem (Lucerne, Switzerland), Lipofectin transfection reagents and Opti-Mem I medium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Vienna, Austria). [Î³-32P]Orthophosphate (10 mCi/ml, 8500-9120 Ci/mmol), [Î³-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol), and Hyperfilm-MP were obtained from Amersham (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). The mouse polyclonal MARCKS antibody was raised in rabbits against the synthetic oligopeptide EAAEPEQPEQPEQPAA with the amino acid sequence corresponding to the sequence 222-237 of murine MARCKS and was purified as described previously (21Lindner D. Gschwendt M. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concerning the fact that this antibody does not interact with one of the described critical phosphorylation sites it should be suitable for immunoprecipitation experiments of all kinds of phosphorylated MARCKS proteins. The plasmid pRc-CMV-PKC-Î», as well as pRc-CMV-PKC-Î» K275W encoding DN PKC-Î» was a kind gift from J. Moscat (22Diaz-Meco M.T. Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Dominguez I. Diaz-Golpe V.

Human PKC-Î·, bovine PKC-Î±, and rat PKC-Îµ wild-type cDNAs were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus (CMV) expression vector pRc-CMV (Invitrogen) essentially as described (24Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Meller N. Coggeshall K.M. Telford D. Giampa L. Isakov N. Altman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of PKC cDNA was performed using the Transformer Systemâ¢ (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Subcloning strategy, mutagenic primers, as well as selection primers for CA PKC-Î± A25E, CA PKC-Îµ A159E, and CA PKC-Î· A148E, as well as DN PKC-Î· K409R have been described elsewhere (19Baier-Bitterlich G. Ãberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PvuI selection primer (5â²-CGG-TCC-TCC-GTT-CGT-TGT-CAG-3â²) and the mutagenic primers (5â²-CTA-TGC-TGT-GAG-GGT-CTT-AAA-GAA-3â² and 5â²-CGA-CGT-GGA-GAA-AGA-TGG-AG-3â²) have been created to construct the mutated version of (DN) PKC-Îµ K436R and (CA) PKC-Î» A119E, respectively.Transient Transfection of COS-1 Cells, Partial Purification, and PKC Assay of Recombinant 6xHis-tagged PKC IsoenzymesCOS-1 cells (1 Ã 106/100-mm dish) were transfected with 15 Î¼g of circular PKC-plasmid DNA/dish by Lipofectin reagents, as described by the manufacturer. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in 1 ml of buffer A (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 Î¼g/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates from these transfectants were purified by using a Ni2+-resin batch procedure, and equal amounts of recombinant PKC isoenzymes were subjected to an enzymatic PKC assay as described elsewhere (19Baier-Bitterlich G.

Signalling. 1994; 6: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities of PKC-Î± and -Î· are expressed as cofactor-dependent phosphorylation of the [A25S] synthetic PKC peptide (RFARKGSLRQKNVY; presenting the pseudosubstrate sequence of PKC-Î± with an alanine to serine substitution) by recombinant PKC or control preparations. Enzyme activity of PKC-Îµ is expressed employing the PKC-Îµ-specific substrate peptide (153-[Ser-159]PKC-Îµ-164)-NH2 corresponding to amino acid residues PRKRQGSVRRV (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The concentrations of substrate peptides and cofactors used are: 50 Î¼g/ml [A25S] and (153-[Ser-159]PKC-Îµ-164)-NH2, 280 Î¼g/ml PtdSer, 10 Î¼M PMA, and 1 mM CaCl2. To measure PKC activity in the absence of Ca2+, EGTA (1 mM, final concentration) was added instead of CaCl2. Expression of the fusion tag-peptide COOH-terminal of PKC-Î±, PKC-Îµ, or PKC-Î· did not affect the kinase activity in vitro (24Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Meller N. Coggeshall K.M. Telford D. Giampa L. Isakov N. Altman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).PKC-Î» Immunocomplex Kinase AssayIn contrast, to the PKC plasmids described above, the pRc-CMV PKC-Î» plasmids do not carry a 6xHis tag, therefore kinase activity of PKC-Î» wild-type (in the absence and presence of various concentrations of GF109203X), as well as DN PKC-Î» K275W and constitutively active (CA) PKC-Î» A119E mutants was performed as described by MÃller and co-workers (26MÃller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), employing an immunocomplex kinase assay. Briefly, transiently transfected COS-1 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in 500 Î¼l of lysis buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM Na4P2O7Â·10H2O (NaPP), 5 mM EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, 25 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 25 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 50 mM sodium fluoride, and 100 mM Na3VO4) for 10 min and lysates clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g, 5 min, 4Â°C. Aliquots of 1.5 Ã 106 NIH cell equivalents, containing equal amounts of protein (500 Î¼l, corresponding to approximately 1.5 mg/ml; protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay; Bio-Rad), were subjected to an immunoprecipitation (IP) procedure employing a corresponding PKC-Î» antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). IPs were recovered by using protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Vienna). PKC-Î» molecules bound to 45 Î¼l of protein A-Sepharose were resuspended in 20 Î¼l of kinase buffer and mixed with 9 Î¼g of myelin basic protein (Sigma M-1891, Sigmas, Vienna), 10 mM PtdSer and Â±various concentrations of GF109203X. The kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.4 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol) and incubation of the tubes by frequent vortexing at 30Â°C for 10 min. Phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was terminated by the addition of 5 Î¼l of 5 Ã SDS sample buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min. Probes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Vienna). Determination of PKC-Î» enzyme activities was done by PhosphorImaging of the corresponding PVDF membranes. The putative potential of the immunocomplexes to alter, either directly or indirectly, the inhibitory activity of GF109203X was addressed by in vitro PKC kinase assays of PKC immunoprecipitates in the presence or absence of various concentrations of GF109203X. Concerning the fact that there was no significant alteration in the dose-response curve (e.g for recPKC-Î±) under these conditions our results favor no direct or indirect influence of the immunocomplexes on the inhibitory potency of GF109203X.Stable Transfection of NIH 3T3 FibroblastsNIH 3T3 fibroblasts were kept at logarithmic growth phase in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 mML-glutamine. One day after plating, semiconfluent cell cultures were refed with low serum medium (Opti-Mem I, Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected with 15 Î¼g of circular PKC-isoform plasmid DNA/dish by Lipofectin reagents, as described by the manufacturer. 16 h post-transfection selection for G-418 resistant colonies was performed in 10% DMEM containing 700 Î¼g/ml G-418. After 12 days of selection antibiotic-resistant cells were isolated as mass cultures and expression of recombinant PKC isoenzymes was checked employing a standard Western blotting technique as described elsewhere (19Baier-Bitterlich G.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Pulse Labeling of NIH 3T3 Cells: MARCKS Phosphorylation AnalysisPulse labeling and MARCKS phosphorylation of NIH 3T3 wild-type fibroblasts or stable transfectants were done by minor modification of the method described by Herget and Rozengurt (27Herget T. Rozengurt E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 wild-type cells or clones stably transfected with distinct PKC isoenzyme expression constructs (1 Ã 106/dish) were incubated in phosphate-free medium (in the presence of 20 nM to 6 Î¼M GF109203X or solvent, Me2SO, final concentration 0.15%) for 4 h, followed by 50 Î¼Ci/ml carrier-free [Î³-32P]orthophosphate (Amersham) pulse labeling of the endogenous ATP pool for an additional 2-h period. During the last 5 min of the labeling period, cells were stimulated with 300 nM PDBu.

Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 Ã g for 10 min and cleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4Â°C. After removal of protein A-Sepharose by brief centrifugation (30 s, Eppendorf microcentrifuge) the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and boiled for 5 min at 90Â°C. After this procedure to destroy heat-instabile proteins the lysates were clarified once more by centrifugation at 13,000 Ã g for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein (500 Î¼l, corresponding to approximately 1.5 mg/ml) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-MARCKS peptide antiserum overnight at 4Â°C. Protein A-Sepharose (100 Î¼l) was added to the tubes for 1 h at 4Â°C. Protein A-Sepharose-coated immunocomplexes were collected by brief centrifugation (1 min, 10,000 Ã g), washed five times with lysis buffer, mixed with 5 Ã Laemmli sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%), and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Vienna). MARCKS phosphorylation analysis was done by PhosphorImaging of the corresponding PVDF membranes.RESULTSPDBu-induced MARCKS Phosphorylation in Intact Cells Is Sensitive in a Dose-dependent Fashion to the PKC-specific Inhibitor GF109203XPhosphorylation of MARCKS in intact cells has been employed as an indicator for PKC activation but the specific PKC isoenzyme responsible for MARCKS phosphorylation in intact cells, however, remained to be identified. Significant reduction of PDBu-induced MARCKS phosphorylation could be demonstrated by using a PKC-specific inhibitor. At concentrations which do not exert a significant effect on cell growth (20 nM to 6 Î¼M), the PKC selective inhibitor GF109203X, a bisindolylmaleimide, that inhibits PKC isoenzymes by competing with enzyme-bound ATP (28Martiny-Baron G.

Therefore, purified recombinant PKC isoforms were tested in the presence of GF109203X. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the appropriate PKC expression constructs or a vector control, and the recombinant PKC was purified by exploiting the COOH-terminal six-histidine (His6)-fusion tag and analyzed in standard PKC kinase assays (19Baier-Bitterlich G.

At lower concentrations than in intact cells, addition of GF109203X to purified recombinant PKC isoenzymes resulted in a significant reduction of protein kinase activity of cPKC-Î±, nPKC-Îµ, and nPKC-Î·. Atypical aPKC-Î», however, did not demonstrate significant inhibition up to GF109203X concentrations of 6 Î¼M (Table I). This dose-response is in agreement with IC50 concentrations determined for inhibition of the atypical PKC-Î¶ isoform by GF109203X (IC50 of PKC-Î¶ 5.8 Î¼M) (28Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G.

Although the glycans at residue 129 are among the smallest on the molecule, they are large enough to reach the receptor binding pocket on their own and adjacent monomers.

It is also the virion component that stimulates the formation of protective antibodies. It is not surprising, therefore, that the nature and extent of glycosylation of the HA have been implicated in altering its receptor binding properties and in the emergence of viral variants with enhanced cytopathogenicity (1Crecelius D.M. Deom C.M. Schulze I.T. Virology. 1984; 139: 164-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2Deom C.M. Caton A.J. Schulze I.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3771-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Aytay S. Schulze I.T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3022-3028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and virulence (4Deshpande K.L. Fried V.A. Ando M. Webster R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and in masking its antigenic sites (5Skehel J.J. Stevens D.J. Daniels R.S. Douglas A.R. Knossow M. Wilson I.A. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1779-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).The amino acid sequence of the HA and hence the location of its N-glycosylation sites is determined by the viral genome. This RNA genome is replicated by a polymerase that lacks editing functions, so that mutations in all of the viral genes occur at a high frequency. One of the consequences of this high mutation frequency is that virus populations contain mutants that differ from the majority in the number and position of the N-linked glycans on the HA. The structures of these oligosaccharides appear to be determined by their position on the HA (6Keil W. Niemann H. Schwarz R.T. Klenk H.-D. Virology. 1984; 133: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Keil W. Geyer R. Dabrowski J. Dabrowski U. Niemann H. Stirm S. Klenk H.-D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2710-2711Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and by the array of biosynthetic and trimming enzymes provided by the host cell in which the virus is grown. Thus, the plasticity of the viral genome and the host-specified glycosylation machinery can, together, create virus populations that are more heterogeneous in structure and function than could be developed by either process alone. This diversity is considered to be responsible for survival of these viruses in a variety of biological niches and for their ability to overcome the inhibitory effects of neutralizing antibodies and antiviral agents.The HA appears to have regions that must be glycosylated, others that must be free of oligosaccharides, and still others in which glycosylation may be either advantageous or detrimental to the survival of the virus. Glycosylation sites at certain positions on the HA of influenza A viruses isolated from various animals and humans are highly conserved and therefore appear to be essential for the formation and/or maintenance of functional HA (8Gallagher P.J. Henneberry J.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7136-7145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the generation of glycosylation sites in certain regions of the HA reduces its transport to the cell surface, and its stability and/or function (9Gallagher P. Henneberry J. Wilson I. Sambrook J. Gething M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2059-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is in the regions in which glycosylation is neither prohibited nor required for the formation of functional HA that oligosaccharide diversity may have a major selective effect, depending on the specific environment in which the virus is expected to grow.We have been using laboratory-isolated variants of an H1 strain to study this type of selection and to evaluate the combined effects of genetic mutation and cell-specific glycan processing on the properties of the HA. The properties of these variants are as follows. The three, designated Fo, Cf, and Co, grow equally well in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) (3Aytay S. Schulze I.T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3022-3028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Noronha-Blob L. Schulze I.T. Virology. 1976; 69: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The Fo variant produces low virus yields on Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. It has a glycosylation site at residue 129 and an Asn at residue 184. This variant is lost from MDBK cell-grown virus populations, due to its low affinity for MDBK-cell receptors (1Crecelius D.M. Deom C.M. Schulze I.T. Virology. 1984; 139: 164-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and is replaced by Cf, which grows to high titer in MDBK cells. Cf has lost the glycosylation site at 129 by an Asn to Asp substitution but is identical to Fo at residue 184 (2Deom C.M. Caton A.J. Schulze I.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3771-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The remaining variant, Co, also grows well in MDBK cells despite having a glycosylation site at residue 129. This variant has His at residue 184 instead of Asn (11Hiti A.L. Davis A.R. Nayak D.P. Virology. 1981; 111: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Schulze I.T. Steward R. Rajakumar A. Aytay S. Virus Res. 1988; 2Google Scholar), as do most of the HAs sequenced to date. Thus, the low receptor binding of the Fo variant appeared to be due to either the combined effects of MDBK cell glycosylation and an amino acid substitution at 184 or to the glycans on Fo being different from those on Co.We therefore undertook the characterization of the glycans at individual sites on the HA1 subunits of these three variants grown in MDBK cells. The glycosylation of the HA2 subunit was not examined. Our aim was to gain information about what, in addition to the spectrum of glycosylating enzymes present in the cell, determines the structure of the glycans on the HA and to explain how these glycans affect the binding activities of these viruses.In this report we relate the glycan structures that we have found to their location in the three-dimensional structure of this glycoprotein (13Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). Last, our work prompts new insights into the role of the viral neuraminidase in determining the structure of glycans put onto the HA by cells of different species.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and VirusesMDBK cells were grown as described previously (1Crecelius D.M.

Virus stocks were maintained in CEFs in which the sequence of the HA at the critical sites was known to remain unchanged.Virus Growth and PurificationThe virus used in all experiments was grown in MDBK cell monolayers overlaid with Earle's basal medium supplemented with 2% calf serum. The cells were infected, and the virus was harvested and purified as described previously (1Crecelius D.M. Deom C.M. Schulze I.T. Virology. 1984; 139: 164-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Pons M.W. Hirst G.J. Virology. 1968; 34: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).HA PurificationVirus was diluted to a concentration of 5 Ã 104 HA units/ml in STE (saline/Tris/EDTA, pH 7.2) and incubated for 20 min at 37Â°C with 0.02 mg/ml L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) to remove the viral neuraminidase. Trypsinized virus was pelleted through a 30% sucrose cushion and resuspended in STE to give 1-ml aliquots containing 1 Ã 104 HA units. The virus was repelleted and washed twice in STE containing 2 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma) and 50 Î¼g/ml each of the protease inhibitors, NÎ±-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride (Sigma) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Washed virus pellets were re-suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3 containing 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 Î¼g/ml each of NÎ±-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspensions were made 50 mM in n-octylglucoside (Sigma) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Disrupted virus suspensions were centrifuged for 25 min (80,000 rpm in a TLA-100.2 Beckman rotor) to remove most of the nucleoprotein and matrix protein. Supernatants, containing essentially all of the HA, were added to immobilized monoclonal antibody columns, prepared as described below (â¼2 Ã 104 HA units of starting material/column), and incubated overnight with mixing at 4Â°C. Unbound material was removed by washing with 10 column volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing dithiothreitol, detergent, and protease inhibitors at the concentrations indicated above. Bound material was eluted with 10 column volumes of 50 mM diethylamine, pH 11.5, containing 50 mM n-octylglucoside. Fractions (0.8 ml) were collected into 80 Î¼l of 0.5 M NaH2PO4 to neutralize the pH. The eluate was assessed for HA content and purity by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Those fractions containing pure HA were pooled, and the protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce & Warriner, Chester, UK), with bovine serum albumin (BSA) for calibration. Purified, quantitated HA was dialyzed against four changes of 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, to remove detergent and then lyophilized and stored, desiccated, at â20Â°C.Preparation of HA Affinity ColumnsHA affinity columns were prepared by chemically cross-linking a monoclonal antibody specific for influenza A/WSN/33 virus HA (79AD.2; Ref. 3Aytay S.

Aggregates in the reaction mixture were removed by low speed centrifugation, and the digested HA was loaded directly onto a Bio-Gel P-30 gel filtration column (0.5 Ã 100 cm) and eluted with 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 2 ml/h. Fractions (1 ml) corresponding to peaks in absorbance at 214 nm were pooled. A 5% (volume) aliquot from each pool was removed for analysis of glucosamine content using a modified version of the Waters PicoTag method (17Zamze S.E. Ashford D.A. Wooten E.W. Rademacher T.W.

The identities of the glycopeptides determined by this method were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, performed by Tony Willis (Medical Research Council Immunochemistry Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford).Isolation and Radiolabeling of CarbohydratesCarbohydrates were released from glycopeptides by hydrazinolysis and radiolabeled with NaB3H4 (Amersham International plc, Little Chalfont, UK) as described previously (19Ashford D. Dwek R.A. Welply J.K. Amatayakul S. Homans S.W. Lis H. Taylor G.N. Sharon N. Rademacher T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry of Glycopeptides and Released OligosaccharidesMass profiles of glycopeptides and released oligosaccharides were obtained on a Micromass AutoSpec QFPD magnetic sector instrument (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK) fitted with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) source and a focal plane detector (20Bordoli R.S. Howes K. Vickers R.G. Bateman R.H. Harvey D.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 8: 585-589Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The matrix used for glycopeptides was a saturated solution of Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (21Beavis R.C. Chaudhary T. Chait B.J. Org.

Released oligosaccharides were prepared for mass spectrometric analysis in the same way, except that the matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Maximum entropy data processing was carried out using Micromass software.Bio-Gel P-4 Gel Filtration Chromatography of Neutral OligosaccharidesNeutral and charged carbohydrates were separated by high voltage electrophoresis, and the isolated neutral carbohydrates were separated by Bio-Gel P-4 high resolution gel filtration chromatography as described previously (19Ashford D.

Radiolabeled glycans were loaded in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, at a flow rate of 50 Î¼l/min. Unbound and weakly bound material was eluted by washing the column with 2.5 ml of loading buffer. Bound material was eluted from A. aurantia lectin with 0.5 mML-fucose (Sigma) and from D. stramonium lectin with 10 mg/ml chitin hydrolysate at a flow rate of 250 Î¼l/min for both lectins. Agarose-bound Griffonia simplicifolia lectin I (Vector Laboratories) was packed into disposable 2-ml Econocolumns (1.5 ml/column), and samples were loaded in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mM CaCl2. Unbound and weakly bound glycans were eluted with 200-Î¼l aliquots of sample loading buffer; strongly bound material was eluted with 50 mMÎ±-methyl galactoside (Sigma), also in 200-Î¼l increments. Elution of glycans was monitored by liquid scintillation counting.Glycosidase TreatmentGlycosidase treatment was performed either sequentially with individual enzymes or with a defined mixture of enzymes; digest products were analyzed by mass spectrometry as described above or by Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration chromatography. The exoglycosidases used were Aspergillus saitoi Î±-1,2-mannosidase (10 milliunits/ml in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, with 1 mg/ml BSA), jack bean Î±-mannosidase (10 units/ml in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.5), coffee bean Î±-galactosidase (5 units/ml in citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, with 1 mg/ml BSA), jack bean Î²-galactosidase (9.3 units/ml in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 3.5, with 1 mg/ml BSA), jack bean Î²-N-acetylhexosaminidase (3 or 10 units/ml in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 5.0, with 1 mg/ml BSA), Charonia lampas Î±-fucosidase (6 units/ml in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, with 0.15 M NaCl), and almond Î±-1,3/4-fucosidase (11 milliunits/ml in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, with 1 mg/ml BSA), all of which were prepared and tested for purity and specificity by Dr. Terry Butters (Glycobiology Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford). Endo-Î²-galactosidase was prepared from Escherichia freundii by Dr. Peter Scudder (22Scudder P. Hanfland P. Uemura K. Feizi T. J. Biol.

All enzyme digests were performed at 37Â°C for 18-22 h under toluene, and the reactions were stopped by lowering the temperature to â20Â°C. Digested samples were desalted and filtered before analysis.RESULTSIsolation and Identification of Individual Glycosylation SitesIndividual glycopeptides corresponding to each glycosylation site of the HA1 subunit were isolated from tryptic digests of Co-, Cf-, and Fo-derived HA by gel filtration chromatography and subsequent reversed-phase HPLC of glucosamine-containing fractions of the eluate (Fig. 1). Glycopeptides were designated GP20/21, GP65, GP129, and GP271 according to the glycosylation site that each contained (Table I).Table IIdentification of glycosylation sites corresponding to isolated glycopeptides.GlycopeptideCompositionPredicted sequenceN-terminal sequenceSiteGP20/21D5EcS2G2HT4YVI3L2KDTICIGYHANNSTDTVDTILEKDTICIGYHAN-STDT21GP65D2EcSG2RTP2IL3CNITGWLLGNPECDSLLPARC-ITGWLLGNPECDS65GP129D2EcS3GH2RT2PV2FESSHPNHTFNGVTVSCSHRESSHP-HTFNGVTVS129GP271D3E3cS4G3HT3A2MI2F2KGFESGIITSNASMHECNTKGFESGIITS-ASMHE271 Open table in a new tab Previous observations had suggested that Asn184 in the sequence Asn-Pro-Ser served as a glycosylation site in two of the variants (Cf and Fo (2Deom C.M. Caton A.J. Schulze I.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3771-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). However, a glycopeptide that corresponded to such a glycosylation site was not present in the digests. We subsequently identified a tryptic peptide containing Asn184 (data not shown), indicating that this sequence is not glycosylated.It was apparent from the amino acid sequence of GP20/21 that either Asn 20 or 21 could serve as an N-linked carbohydrate attachment site (see Table I). For all three variants, N-terminal sequencing of this glycopeptide gave a positive identification of Asn at position 20 but a blank in the cycle of Edman degradation for residue 21, indicating that residue 21 carried the carbohydrate moiety. A similar observation was made by Deshpande et al. (4Deshpande K.L. Fried V.A. Ando M. Webster R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) for a related sequence in the HA from an avian H5 strain of influenza.Structural Characterization of N-GlycansIsolation of Neutral GlycansThe charged and neutral radiolabeled N-glycans from each glycopeptide were separated by high voltage electrophoresis. In all cases, only a very small proportion of the glycans were charged. Site 21 carried the largest proportion of charged glycans (<5%), and this charge was due mainly to sulfation (determined by neuraminidase treatment and chemical desulfation; data not shown).Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration chromatography of the neutral glycans showed that the elution profiles of the individual glycosylation sites differed markedly, indicating site-specific glycosylation (Fig. 2). The simplest elution profiles were from glycosylation site 65 (Fig. 2b), which showed little heterogeneity. The elution volume of the major species (K in Fig. 2b) was characteristic of the oligomannose structure Man9GlcNAc2 (23Kobata A. Yamashita K. Takasaki S.

Species K and L were reduced to single 9-gu species on treatment with A. saitoi Î±-1,2-mannosidase, indicating the removal of four and three terminal Î±-1,2-linked Man residues, respectively. This component was further reduced to a 5.5-gu structure on treatment with jack bean Î±-mannosidase, indicative of the removal of the four remaining Î±-linked Man residues, leaving only the Man residue Î²-linked to the chitobiose core. This behavior was exactly that expected of authentic Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2.Complex-type Oligosaccharides Mass Spectrometric AnalysisInitial attempts to sequence the neutral glycans at site 129 of the Co and Fo variants by sequential exoglycosidase treatment (devised on the basis of the hydrodynamic volumes obtained from Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration chromatography) were unsuccessful. When the glycopeptides were reexamined by mass spectrometry, it became apparent that these glycosylation sites contained uncommon complex-type N-glycans. The mass profiles for the two variants (Fig. 3) were highly similar, suggesting that they carried highly similar structures at this glycosylation site. Two major (4167 Da (B) and 4327 Da (C)) and two minor (4005 Da (A) and 4489 Da (D)) mass species were found that, assuming complete trypsinization of the HA and no mass variation due to peptide, represent an oligosaccharide series differing by 162 Da (1 hexose unit). These results suggested that the structures at this site terminated in Gal-Gal sequences. Although these data gave no indication of the anomericity of the linkage between these Gal residues, they were likely to be Î±-linked, since previous studies have identified Î±-1,3-galactosyltransferase activity in bovine cells (24Van den Eijnden D.H.

Cummings R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 232-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Neutral glycans from sites 21, 129, and 271 were first fractionated on immobilized A. aurantia lectin, which binds structures with a fucose residue Î±-1,6-linked to the chitobiose core (âcore-fucosylatedâ) (27Yamashita K. Kochibe N. Ohkura T. Ueda I. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4688-4693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major fractions from A. aurantia lectin affinity chromatography were subsequently subfractionated on immobilized D. stramonium lectin. D. stramonium lectin binds strongly to tri- and tetraantennary oligosaccharides containing the pentasaccharide unit GalÎ²4GlcNAcÎ²6(GalÎ²4GlcNAcÎ²2)Man and/or lactosamine units (GalÎ²4GlcNac) extending one or more of the outer arms and less strongly to oligosaccharides containing GalÎ²4GlcNAcÎ²4(GalÎ²4GlcNAcÎ²2)Man (28Yamashita K. Totani K. Ohkura T. Takasaki S. Goldstein I.J. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1602-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strongly bound material is eluted with GlcNAc oligomers, and weakly bound material is eluted as a retarded fraction without the addition of GlcNAc oligomers. D. stramonium lectin binding properties are abolished by outer arm fucosylation. Finally, the major glycan fractions from D. stramonium lectin affinity chromatography were fractionated on immobilized G. simplicifolia lectin I. This lectin binds strongly to glycans containing two or more terminal Î±-linked Gal or GalNAc residues and weakly to those containing only a single terminal Î±-Gal/GalNAc.The serial lectin affinity profiles of glycans from glycosylation sites 21, 129, and 271 (Fig. 4 and Table III) were similar for the three HAs at a given glycosylation site, and the majority of the glycans at all three sites were core-fucosylated as judged by their binding to A. aurantia lectin. Most of the core-fucosylated glycans at site 129 from Co and Fo failed to bind to D. stramonium lectin, suggesting limited branching (biantennary structures). This, together with the mass spectrometry data and the hydrodynamic volumes, suggested the presence of bisecting GlcNAc residues. The behavior of these A+/Dâ glycans on G. simpli"

In the present study it is shown that PGGT-I binds GGPP 330-fold tighter than FPP and that PFT binds FPP 15-fold tighter than GGPP. Therefore, <i>in vivo</i>, where both GGPP and FPP compete for the binding to prenyltransferases, PGGT-I and PFT will likely be bound predominantly to GGPP and FPP, respectively. Previous studies have shown that K-Ras4B and the Ras-related GTPase TC21 are substrates for both PGGT-I and PFT <i>in vitro</i> It is shown that TC21 can compete with the C-terminal peptide of the Î³ subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins and with the C-terminal peptide of lamin B for geranylgeranylation by PGGT-I and for farnesylation by PFT, respectively. K-Ras4B competes in both cases but is almost exclusively farnesylated by PFT in the presence of the lamin B peptide competitor. Rapid and single turnover kinetic studies indicate that the rate constant for the PGGT-I-catalyzed geranylgeranyl transfer step of the reaction cycle is 14-fold larger than the steady-state turnover number, which indicates that the rate of the overall reaction is limited by a step subsequent to prenyl transfer such as release of products from the enzyme. PGGT-I-catalyzed farnesylation is 37-fold slower than geranylgeranylation and is limited by the farnesyl transfer step. These results together with earlier studies provide a paradigm for the substrate specificity of PGGT-I and PFT and provide information that is critical for the design of prenyltransferase inhibitors as anti-cancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W2102518374,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is implicated in the induction of several malignancies. The nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is the only viral protein that is expressed consistently in all EBV-associated tumors. EBNA1 is involved in the replication and maintenance of the viral episome in the infected cell and exhibits oncogenic activity in transgenic mice. Here we report the identification of the nuclear transporter karyopherin alpha2 as a cellular partner of EBNA1 using the yeast two-hybrid system. Karyopherin alpha2 is also called importin alpha or Rch1. The binding to karyopherin alpha2 was mediated through a C-terminal region of EBNA1 encompassing the nuclear localization signal, whereas clones of EBNA1 devoid of the nuclear localization signal failed to bind to karyopherin alpha2. The interaction was biochemically confirmed by far-Western analysis using bacterially expressed karyopherin alpha2 and karyopherin alpha2-specific monoclonal antibodies. The nuclear transport of EBNA1 was impaired by expression of N-terminally truncated karyopherin alpha2. Zone velocity sedimentation in a sucrose gradient indicated that: (i) EBNA1 and Rch1 colocalize; and (ii) the association of karyopherin alpha2 with high molecular weight protein complexes might be impeded by the presence of EBNA1."

https://openalex.org/W2043206126,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a metabolite of NADP with Ca2+ mobilizing activity. The Ca2+ release mechanism activated by NAADP as well as the Ca2+ stores that it acts on are different from those activated by either cyclic ADP-ribose or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (Lee, H. C., and Aarhus, R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2152-2157). In order to demonstrate unambiguously that NAADP can mobilize Ca2+ stores in live cells, a caged analog was synthesized by reacting NAADP with 1-(2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane. Anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to purify one particular caged form from the mixture of products. Phosphate analyses following specific enzymatic cleavage indicate that the caging group is on the 2â²-phosphate. This is confirmed by 31P NMR spectroscopy, showing that the 2â²-phosphate of the caged compound exhibits an altered chemical shift of â2.6 ppm as compared with 2.3 ppm determined for the 2â²-phosphate of NAADP. Caged NAADP had no Ca2+ releasing activity at a concentration as high as 1 Î¼M when tested on sea urchin egg microsomes. After photolysis, it released Ca2+, was effective in nanomolar range, and was indistinguishable from authentic NAADP. The regeneration of NAADP after photolysis was also confirmed by HPLC analyses. The analog is particularly susceptible to UV and can be efficiently photolyzed using a spectrofluorimeter. To demonstrate its utility in live cells, caged NAADP was microinjected into sea urchin eggs. Photolysis effectively regenerated NAADP and activated Ca2+ oscillations in the eggs. Removal of external Ca2+ did not prevent the Ca2+ oscillations but only delayed the second Ca2+ peak by about 45 s, indicating that the oscillations are due to release from internal stores and not caused by Ca2+ influx. A mechanism based on sensitization of the Ca2+ release by Ca2+ loading is proposed to account for the Ca2+ oscillation observed. Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a metabolite of NADP with Ca2+ mobilizing activity.

C., and Aarhus, R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2152-2157). In order to demonstrate unambiguously that NAADP can mobilize Ca2+ stores in live cells, a caged analog was synthesized by reacting NAADP with 1-(2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane. Anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to purify one particular caged form from the mixture of products. Phosphate analyses following specific enzymatic cleavage indicate that the caging group is on the 2â²-phosphate. This is confirmed by 31P NMR spectroscopy, showing that the 2â²-phosphate of the caged compound exhibits an altered chemical shift of â2.6 ppm as compared with 2.3 ppm determined for the 2â²-phosphate of NAADP. Caged NAADP had no Ca2+ releasing activity at a concentration as high as 1 Î¼M when tested on sea urchin egg microsomes. After photolysis, it released Ca2+, was effective in nanomolar range, and was indistinguishable from authentic NAADP. The regeneration of NAADP after photolysis was also confirmed by HPLC analyses. The analog is particularly susceptible to UV and can be efficiently photolyzed using a spectrofluorimeter. To demonstrate its utility in live cells, caged NAADP was microinjected into sea urchin eggs. Photolysis effectively regenerated NAADP and activated Ca2+ oscillations in the eggs. Removal of external Ca2+ did not prevent the Ca2+ oscillations but only delayed the second Ca2+ peak by about 45 s, indicating that the oscillations are due to release from internal stores and not caused by Ca2+ influx. A mechanism based on sensitization of the Ca2+ release by Ca2+ loading is proposed to account for the Ca2+ oscillation observed. In addition to inositol trisphosphate, two other independent mechanisms for mobilizing internal Ca2+ stores have been identified in sea urchin eggs. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) 1The abbreviations used are: cADPRcyclic ADP-riboseNAADnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotideNAADPnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateNPE1-(2-nitrophenyl)diazoethaneHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyASWartificial seawater0CaSWCa2+-free seawater. and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) are Ca2+-mobilizing metabolites derived, respectively, from NAD (1Clapper D.L.

In one case it can function as a modulator of the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism and, synergistically with calmodulin, increase the sensitivity of the release mechanism to divalent cations by several orders of magnitude (6Galione A.

Nitric oxide, through elevating intracellular cGMP levels, can activate the synthesizing enzyme of cADPR, resulting in an increase in cellular cADPR and mobilization of Ca2+ stores (10Galione A.

Since the Ca2+ releasing activity of cADPR was first described in sea urchin eggs, a variety of mammalian, amphibian, and plant cells have been shown to be responsive to cADPR, indicating its general relevance (1Clapper D.L.

NAADP is not a cyclic molecule; instead, it is formed by replacing the nicotinamide group of NADP with nicotinic acid (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ release mechanism activated by NAADP has many characteristics of an independent signaling pathway. In sea urchin eggs, NAADP is by far the most effective Ca2+ release agonist and is active at nanomolar concentrations (1Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

The NAADP-dependent Ca2+ release is not inhibited by high concentrations of Mg2+ (14Graeff R. Podein R.J. Aarhus R. Lee H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These properties distinguish it from the cADPR-dependent pathway. NAADP is likely to be operating through a distinct receptor. Specific binding of 32P-NAADP to sea urchin egg microsomes has been demonstrated, and cADPR has no effect on the binding (16Aarhus R.

One novel property of the NAADP mechanism is that, at subthreshold concentrations, NAADP can completely inactivate the release system such that subsequent challenge with a maximal concentration of NAADP is ineffective (16Aarhus R.

Ligand binding studies show that the self-inactivation occurs at the level of the receptor (16Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

This novel property is not seen in either cADPR- or IP3-dependent Ca2+ release and is likely to be the first description of such a process in receptor-mediated function. Although the structures and functions of cADPR and NAADP are totally distinct, the two Ca2+ agonists can, in fact, be synthesized by the same enzymes (18Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F.

Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), can catalyze the exchange of the nicotinamide in NADP with nicotinic acid (18Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The base exchange reaction dominates at acidic pH, while at neutral and alkaline pH, both enzymes preferentially cyclize NADP to produce cyclic ADP-ribose phosphate (18Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the synthesis of caged NAADP and the usefulness of the analog in investigating the Ca2+ release mechanism of NAADP in microsomes as well as in live cells. NAADP was synthesized by incubating NADP (1 mM) at pH 5.0 with the Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase (25 ng/ml) in the presence of 30 mM nicotinic acid for several hours at 20-23Â°C and purified by HPLC using an AG MP-1 column as described previously (18Aarhus R.

The caging reagent 1-(2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane (NPE), originally described by Walker et al. (20Walker J.W. Reid G.P. McCray J.A. Trentham D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7170-7177Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar) for the synthesis of caged ATP and related nucleotides and more recently used to prepare NPE-cADPR (21Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was used to prepare NPE-NAADP. NAADP has three phosphate groups and one carboxylate, all of which are potentially reactive with the caging reagent, provided they are protonated during the caging reaction. The caging reaction was done at two different pH values; first at pH 4.5 and then at pH 1.3. A solution of NAADP (1.0 mg, 1.3 Î¼mol) in water (0.5 ml) was prepared at room temperature; the pH was 4.5. A solution of the caging diazoethane reagent (13 Î¼mol) in ether (0.5 ml) was added, and the resulting biphasic mixture stirred vigorously for 2 h in darkness, during which the ether layer changed from amber to light yellow. The ether layer was drawn off, and a fresh solution of the caging reagent was added. After stirring for another 3 h, the amber ether layer was drawn off. Thin layer chromatographic analysis indicated complete conversion of starting NAADP (RF 0.13, methanol:choroform:water:acetic acid, 13:10:3.5:0.2, silica gel plates) to a single less polar product (RF 0.87). The aqueous layer was extracted with ether (2 Ã l.5 ml), then applied directly to a column of Sephadex LH-20 (2 Ã 6 cm). The product was eluted by gravity with water and lyophilized, yielding 0.5 mg of a pale yellow powder. This caged compound was found to be not very susceptible to photolysis and was not characterized further. Reducing the pH of the caging reaction to 1.3 resulted in a caged product much more photolabile. NAADP (24 mg, 32 Î¼mol) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of water and the solution was adjusted to pH 1.3 by addition of dilute aqueous HCl. The diazoethane reagent (0.2 mmol) in 3 ml ether was added and stirred vigorously for 8 h in darkness as described above. The reagent was replaced twice and stirred each time for 3 h. TLC analysis indicated no remaining NAADP and two major products with RF values of 0.87 and 0.46. The least polar product (RF 0.87) co-eluted on TLC with the higher pH product described above. After the aqueous layer was extracted with ether (2 Ã 3 ml), the more polar product (RF 0.46) was separated on a column of Sephadex LH-20 (2 Ã 8 cm). A pale yellow powder of 8.6 mg (32% yield) of the caged product was obtained, which was found to be much more photolabile than the higher pH product described above. This product was further characterized and used in this study. Photolysis with a hand-held UV lamp showed significant conversion to free NAADP, as judged by TLC analysis. Homogenates of sea urchin egg (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) were prepared as described previously (21Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Frozen egg homogenates (25%) were thawed at 17Â°C for 20 min and diluted to 5% with a medium containing 250 mM N-methylglucamine, 250 mM potassium gluconate, 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 units/ml creatine kinase, 8 mM phosphocreatine, 0.5 mM ATP, and 3 Î¼M fluo-3, pH 7.2, adjusted with acetic acid. The homogenates were diluted to 2.5% and finally 1.25% with the medium described and were incubated at 17Â°C for 1 h between dilutions. Ca2+ release was measured spectrofluorimetrically in 1.25% homogenates with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm. The measurements were done in a cuvette maintained at 17Â°C, and the homogenates were continuously stirred. The volume of homogenate used was 0.2 ml, and additions were usually made in 2-Î¼l volumes. Lytechinus pictus eggs were used for the microinjection experiments. The procedures for microinjection by pressure were as described previously (21Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Ca2+ changes in the injected eggs were measured using fluo-3. Samples were dissolved in the injection buffer containing 0.5 M KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, pH 6.7. The injected volume was about 1% of the egg. Eggs were attached to the bottom of a protamine sulfate-coated culture dish and incubated with artificial seawater (ASW) containing 460 mM NaCl, 27 mM MgCl2, 28 mM MgSO4, 10 mM CaCl2, 10 mM KCl, 2.5 mM NaHCO3, pH 8.0. In some experiments, ASW was changed to Ca2+-free seawater (0CaSW) after microinjection using gravity perfusion. 0CaSW had the same composition as ASW except without CaCl2, and the concentration of NaCl was increased to 470 mM. In most experiments, the 0CaSW was supplemented with 0.2-1 mM EGTA. All media were kept at 17Â°C. Activation of caged cADPR in egg homogenates was achieved in a Hitachi spectrofluorimeter (S-2000) by alternating the excitation wavelength every 2 s between 350 nm for photolysis and 485 nm for monitoring fluo-3 fluorescence. In some experiments, photolysis with UV light (1015 quanta/s) for 1 min was done in a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet Co.) at 0-4Â°C. The UV photolysis and fluorescence measurement of individual eggs were done using the InCa2+ imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Excitation was provided by a 300-Watt xenon lamp equipped with filters for 340- and 485-nm light. During photolysis, the excitation light was alternated between the uncaging (340 nm) and the monitoring (485 nm) wavelengths, both of which were reflected by a BCECF Sp dichroic filter toward the objective. The fluo-3 fluorescence was selected by a long pass filter with a 500-nm cutoff and monitored by a CCD camera. Fluo-3 fluorescence was measured every 4 s. Photolysis was performed for 3.5 s between measurements. As the xenon lamp aged, the intensity of UV light decreased. In some experiments, to compensate for the diminished UV intensity, the 340-nm filter was removed during photolysis. HPLC separation was done with columns packed with AG MP-1 resin (Bio-Rad) and eluted with a nonlinear gradient of trifluoroacetic acid similar to that described previously (15Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The final purification of the caged NAADP was achieved using a 0.5 Ã 5-cm Mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The product was eluted using a gradient of water (solvent A) and 1 M triethylamine bicarbonate (solvent B, pH 8.8): 0-12 min, 0% B; linearly increased to 20% B from 12 to 16 min, linearly increased to 30% B from 16 to 36 min, linearly increased to 100% from 36 to 37 min and held at 100% B for 3 min before returning to 0% B. Caged NAADP, NAADP, and photolyzed caged NAADP, all at 28 Î¼M, were incubated with 2 units/ml alkaline phosphatase (Sigma), or 3.5 units/ml nucleotide pyrophosphatase (Sigma), or both enzymes together, in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2 and 80 mM triethylamine bicarbonate, pH 8.8, for 20 min at 37Â°C. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 10 Î¼l. The phosphate released by the enzymes was measured by adding 0.1 ml of the Malachite Green reagent (22Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) and 10 Î¼l of 34% sodium citrate. Absorbance at 660 nm was measured and compared with sodium phosphate standards. Spectra were collected at an observation frequency of 161.9 MHz using a Varian UNITY plus 400 FT-NMR spectrometer which was equipped with a computer switchable Nalorac 4N400-5+ 5 mm 4-nucleus probe (1H, 19F, 13C, 31P). All samples were dissolved in a D2O solution buffered at pH 7.5 with 10 mM Hepes. All spectra were acquired at an ambient room temperature of 22-23Â°C. A phosphoric acid (H3PO4) solution in methanol in a 2-mm coaxial tube was used as external 31P NMR standard for zero chemical shift calibration for all spectra. Negative chemical shifts are upfield of (lower frequency than) H3PO4. The acquisition conditions used for all the spectra include spectral width of 48543 Hz; acquisition time of 0.338 s; number of acquisition data points of 32768; pulsed flip angles ranging from 20 to 50Â°, depending on the experiment (PW90 was about 50 Î¼s); relaxation delay of 3-4 s, depending on the experiment; and number of transients ranging from 400 to 30,000, depending on the experiment. All 31P NMR spectra were proton-decoupled, with the decoupler gated on only during the acquisition period of the free induction decay. Data processing included zero-filling the free induction decays to 65536 data points and using an exponential weighting apodization function with a line broadening of 2.5 Hz to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the transformed spectrum. We have previously synthesized caged cADPR that is particularly photolabile. Effective photolysis can be accomplished with standard spectrofluorimeters or epifluorescence setups, and no specialized equipment is required (21Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). NAADP represented a special challenge since it has three phosphate groups as well as a carboxyl group which are all reactive toward the NPE reagent (20Walker J.W. Reid G.P. McCray J.A. Trentham D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7170-7177Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Since it is known that the NPE reagent reacts mainly with protonated groups, the caging reaction was performed at either pH 4.5 or 1.3 so that different ionizable groups could be sampled. The caged product obtained at the higher pH value was found to be difficult to photolyze. Even after prolonged exposure to a hand-held UV lamp, no detectable NAADP was produced as judged by TLC analysis. In sea urchin egg homogenate, the caged material was inactive as a Ca2+ mobilizer, but prolonged photolysis only slowly and weakly generated free NAADP (data not shown). The product was not characterized further, but the poor photolysis properties are characteristic of carboxylates caged as NPE esters (23Wilcox M. Viola R.W. Johnson K.W. Billington A.P. Carpenter B.K. McCray J.A. Guzikowski A.P. Hess G.P. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 1585-1589Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We next reduced the pH of the reaction to 1.3, a condition at which all four groups would be reactive. We did not have prior knowledge of which phosphate group would be the most appropriate for caging and which specific groups should be protected from being caged. Therefore, the strategy was not to focus on a particular group, but instead, to separate the mixture of products by chromotography and analyze each fraction using sea urchin egg homogenates as a bioassay for Ca2+ release (1Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product was expected not to release Ca2+ on its own but to be easily photolyzed using a spectrofluorimeter and to regenerate the Ca2+ release activity of NAADP. TLC analyses of the caged products produced at pH 1.3 showed two main spots with RF values of 0.87 and 0.46, respectively. The more polar products (RF 0.46) were separated using a Sephadex column (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). Fig. 1 (top) shows a HPLC chromatograph of the caged products analyzed on an AG MP-1 column. It was found to contain several components. All three peaks were collected and tested for Ca2+ release activity before and after photolysis. Only the smallest peak, indicated with an asterisk, satisfied our criteria. The product was purified one more time on an AG MP-1 column followed by twice on a Mono-Q column. Fig. 1 (bottom) shows the purified product eluted as a single peak on the second Mono-Q column. Starting from 5 mg of the product mixture, about 50 Î¼g of purified caged NAADP was obtained. To determine which of the phosphates is caged, we used nucleotide pyrophosphatase to cleave the pyrophosphate linkage of the molecule and alkaline phosphatase to release the phosphate groups as inorganic phosphate. Alkaline phosphatase should also cleave the 2â²-phosphate group if it is not caged. The Pi released was measured using the Malachite Green method (22Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that treatment with alkaline phosphatase released about 1 mol of Pi per mol of NAADP (open bars), which corresponds to the 2â²-phosphate of the molecule. Nucleotide pyrophosphatase cleaved the molecule but did not release any Pi by itself. After nucleotide pyrophosphatase treatment, all the phosphate groups of the cleaved molecule should be susceptible to alkaline phosphatase. Indeed, treatment with both enyzmes (MIX) produced about 3 mol of Pi/mol of NAADP, as expected. In contrast to NAADP, treatment of caged NAADP (black bars) with alkaline phosphatase produced no Pi, indicating that the 2â²-phosphate is caged. Treatment with the combined enzymes released the two phosphates forming the pyrophosphate linkage. The pattern of Pi released from the photolyzed caged NAADP (gray bars) following the enzyme treatments is the same as that of NAADP. These results are consistent with the caged group being attached to the 2â²-phosphate of NAADP. The structural assignment is further confirmed by 31P NMR analyses. Fig. 3 compares the 31P NMR spectra of two standards, NAADP and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD), with that of the purified caged NAADP. The chemical shift was calibrated with an external phosphoric acid sample that had its chemical shift set to zero. The spectrum of NAADP shows two peaks at 2.3 ppm and â12.2 ppm. The negative parts/million peak represents the diphosphate of NAADP since its integrated area is about twice (2.09) that of the other peak. The two phosphorus atoms of the diphosphate are chemically equivalent and both are expected to have the same chemical shift. This assignment is supported by the spectrum of NAAD. The compound lacks the 2â²-phosphate but contains the same diphosphate, and its spectrum shows only one peak at â12.2 ppm, a chemical shift value very similar to the diphosphate peak of NAADP. The spectrum of the caged NAADP also shows two peaks. The diphosphate peak has a chemical shift of â12.4, very similar to the diphosphate peaks of both NAADP and NAAD. The graphical integration shown above the spectrum indicates the area of the diphosphate peak is 1.78 times that of the 2â²-phosphate peak. The chemical shift of the 2â²-phosphate of the caged compound is changed to â2.6 ppm from 2.3 ppm of the 2â²-phosphate of NAADP. This dramatic shift of the 2â²-phosphate is consistent with the caging group being attached there. A noticeable feature of the spectrum of caged NAADP is that the peaks are broader than that of NAADP. The reason for the broadening is not known but could be due to reduced mobility of the caged compound in solution. The hydrophobicity of the cage group could promote intermolecular association especially at the relatively high concentration (â4 mg/ml) needed for obtaining the 31P NMR spectrum. In any case, results from specific enzymatic cleavage and 31P NMR analyses are consistent with the caging group being on the 2â²-phosphate. The structure of caged NAADP is shown in Fig. 4.Fig. 4The proposed structure of caged NAADP. The structure of NAADP is as described in Lee and Aarhus (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The caging group is shown attached to the 2â²-phosphate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 5B shows that addition of caged NAADP from 90 to 900 nM to egg homogenates produced no Ca2+ release. The small jumps of fluo-3 fluorescence at high concentrations of caged NAADP were due to addition artifacts (e.g. small Ca2+ contamination in the samples), since they were present even when the release mechanism was totally inactivated (tracing labeled 8â² in Fig. 5A). A novel property of the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release is that the release mechanism can be totally inactivated by pretreatment with a subthreshold concentration of NAADP as low as 1 nM (16Aarhus R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The multistep procedure described above for the purification of caged NAADP was designed to ensure that the contaminating NAADP is below the self-inactivating levels. Fig. 5 also shows the results of testing the inactivating effect of caged NAADP. Egg homogenates were pretreated with 1 nM NAADP and subsequently challenged with a maximal concentration (40 nM) (Fig. 5A). After 2 min of pretreatment, the response to 40 nM NAADP was substantially reduced (tracing labeled 2â²) as compared to without pretreatment (tracing labeled 0â²) and was totally eliminated after 8 min of pretreatment (tracing labeled 8â²). Pretreatment of the homogenates with 90 nM caged NAADP for 2 min produced very little inactivation (Fig. 5B). At 540 nM caged NAADP, the extent of inactivation following the pretreatment was similar to that effected by 1 nM of NAADP (comparing Fig. 5A, 2â², with Fig. 5B, 540 nM). This extent of inactivation by the caged compound can be accounted for if the sample is contaminated with about 0.1-0.2% NAADP. This appears to be the case since freshly purified samples of the caged compound at 200 nM exhibited essentially no inactivation as shown in Fig. 6. Even at 900 nM of caged NAADP, the inactivation due to pretreatment was only about 30-40%. Results in Fig. 2 indicate NAADP is very sensitive to alkaline phosphatase while the caged compound is not. Treatment of the 900 nM sample with alkaline phosphatase (+APase), indeed, essentially removed all the inactivation. Results described in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 thus show that caged NAADP is biologically inactive. It does not release Ca2+ nor does it induce inactivation. Fig. 7 shows that photolysis of caged NAADP regenerates NAADP. The samples, before and after photolysis, were analyzed by HPLC. The retention time of the photolyzed product was the same as that of NAADP, which was shifted as compared with caged NAADP. The photolyzed product was effective in releasing Ca2+ as shown in Fig. 8 and, in fact, its concentration dependence was indistinguishable from that of NAADP. Also shown in Fig. 8 is that caged NAADP, before photolysis, had no Ca2+ releasing activity at concentrations as high as 1 Î¼M. Further evidence that the photolyzed product is NAADP is provided by its desensitization of the NAADP-dependent Ca2+ release in egg homogenates. The results are shown in the inset of Fig. 8. At 28 nM, the photolyzed product induced rapid Ca2+ release. The egg homogenate became totally desensitized such that subsequent addition of 80 nM NAADP, after the Ca2+ was resequestered, did not produce any release. Homogenates desensitized to prior exposure to 80 nM NAADP also did not respond to the photolyzed product. This cross-desensitization indicates the photolyzed product is indeed, NAADP.Fig. 8A comparison of the dependence of Ca2+ release on the concentration of NAADP and photolyzed caged NAADP. Ca2+ release was measured in sea urchin egg homogenates using fluo-3. Photolysis was induced by UV exposure in a photochemical reactor for 1 min at 0-4Â°C. The concentration-response of the photolyzed caged NAADP (filled squares) was indistingushable from that of NAADP (opened squares), and caged NAADP (filled triangles) was inactive. The inset shows the cross-desensitization between NAADP and the photolyzed product, indicating the latter was, in fact, NAADP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 9 shows that NAADP can be regenerated from caged NAADP using a spectrofluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was alternated between 350 nm for photolysis and 485 nm for monitoring the fluorescence of the Ca2+ indicator, fluo-3. Addition of caged NAADP to the egg homogenates with the alternating UV excitation turned on resulted in Ca2+ release after a brief delay (Fig. 9A). The delay was more prominent at the lower concentrations. Comparison of the Ca2+ release activity with that induced by NAADP itself shows that about 1% of the caged NAADP added was photolyzed. This low efficiency is due to the relative weak UV excitation light of the spectrofluorimeter. Fig. 9B compares the concentration-response of NAADP and caged NAADP with or without UV photolysis. Because NAADP is effective in releasing Ca2+ at nanomolar concentrations, the low efficiency of photolysis by the spectrofluorimeter does not hamper its use in this setting. A common problem in measuring Ca2+ release from a suspension of permeabilized cells or cell-free assays, such as that shown in Fig. 9, is distinguishing Ca2+ release from Ca2+ contamination in the samples. The caged analog should be useful since it is not biologically active until photolysis, which can be accomplished conveniently by simply alternating the excitation wavelength in a spectrofluorimeter. The caged analog is also useful in single cell measurements. We have previously shown that photolyzing caged NAADP loaded into sea urchin eggs can induce Ca2+ oscillations (16Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In some cases, these Ca2+ oscillations persist for more than 30 min. The possibility that Ca2+ influx may be involved in generating these oscillations was investigated by removing external Ca2+. We focused on the first two Ca2+ oscillations that occur within 6-7 min after photolysis. Fig. 10 shows that removal of external Ca2+ does not prevent the Ca2+ change induced by photolysis nor does it inhibit the subsequent Ca2+ oscillation that occurs spontaneously. The main effect of removal of external Ca2+ is a delay of the occurrence of the second Ca2+ peak. This delay separates the second peak farther from the first peak and makes it appear more prominent in the case of 0CaSW. Table I summarizes the results from 16 eggs in 0CaSW and 17 eggs in ASW. Both the magnitude of the two Ca2+ peaks and the time of the first Ca2+ peak are independent of external Ca2+. These results show that the internal stores are the main source of the Ca2+ changes induced by photolyzing caged NAADP as well as the subsequent Ca2+ oscillation. It should be noted that in another five eggs in 0CaSW, photolysis induced no change in internal Ca2+. It is likely that these eggs had suffered damage during microinjection. The leakage of EGTA into the eggs could have buffered the Ca2+ changes. In ASW the second peak occurred at 115.7 Â± 6.6 s after the start of photolysis. In 0CaSW, the second peak occurred at 161.5 Â± 12.6 s, a 45-s delay. The exact mechanism of how removal external Ca2+ can delay the Ca2+ oscillation remains to be elucidated. One possibility is proposed in the âDiscussion.âTable ICalcium oscillations induced by photolyzing caged NAADPFirst Ca2+ peakSecond Ca2+ peak[Caged NAADP]iT1âT2Fmax/F0T1Fmax/F0T2ssnMs0CaSW6.7 Â± 0.817.0 Â± 1.05.1 Â± 0.7161.5 Â± 12.6186.4 Â± 23.8144.5ASW7.3 Â± 0.616.8 Â± 1.84.6 Â± 0.3115.7 Â± 6.6175.8 Â± 20.698.9 Open table in a new tab As described in the introduction, the Ca2+ release mechanism activated by NAADP has many properties of a signaling pathway. In this study, we describe two other properties of NAADP that strengthen its signaling role. First, it is highly effective in live cells, which can be unambiguously demonstrated using the caged analog. Indeed, loading of eggs with about 200 nM caged NAADP was more than sufficient (Table I), a concentration which is 10-fold lower than that required for caged cADPR (21Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Removal of external Ca2+ did not inhibit the Ca2+ change induced by photolyzing caged NAADP in live eggs, indicating the source of Ca2+ is from internal stores. Second, NAADP can be degraded effectively by phosphatases, such as nucleotide pyrophosphatase and alkaline phosphatase. An effective enzymatic system for removal is a hallmark of a signaling molecule, whose action needs to be terminated once its function is completed. The degradation pathway is particularly important for NAADP because of its potent self-inactivation property. The general presence of phosphatases in cells should ensure that NAADP is degraded. Photolysis of caged NAADP in live eggs produces not only a single Ca2+ transient but also spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations that last for more than 30 min (16Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The oscillation is not abolished by removal of external Ca2+, indicating that the Ca2+ also comes from internal stores (Fig. 10). The exact mechanism is not known. One possibility is that the Ca2+ released from the NAADP stores is sequestered by cADPR-sensitive stores, overloading the latter and triggering spontaneous release. It has previously been shown that Ca2+ overloading not only can trigger spontaneous release in egg homogenates, but also can sensitize the stores to cADPR by 50-fold or more (24Galione A. McDougall A. Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M. Science. 1993; 261: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The sensitization could conceivably enable the basal concentration of cADPR endogenously present in eggs to activate further release, generating the second Ca2+ peak seen in Fig. 10. If external Ca2+ is present, influx could hasten the overloading and/or sensitization of the cADPR stores and speed up the occurrence of the second Ca2+ peak as shown in Fig. 10. The overloading mechanism could also account for the ineffectiveness of either cADPR or IP3 in triggering Ca2+ oscillation, since both agonists release from the same stores (16Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and the majority of the Ca2+ released by either of them would likely be sequestered by the NAADP-sensitive stores, which may not have the same type of Ca2+ release mechanism that is sensitive to intravesicular Ca2+. Whether this overloading mechanism is in fact operative in eggs remains to be established, but it does provide rationalization of how the interplay of various Ca2+ stores can result in generation of Ca2+ oscillation. The synthesis of caged NAADP described in this study produces only modest yield. This is not a major problem for biological use because of the incredible potency of NAADP in inducing Ca2+ release. The main reason for adopting the nonselective strategy we have used is that there was no a priori knowledge of which of the four acidic groups should be caged. The results described in this study establish that the caging group attached to the 2â²-phosphate is the most appropriate for photolysis. Improvement on the yield can now be rationally designed by protecting the other groups before the caging reaction.

We have analyzed the effects of transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1) on the basal melanogenic activities of B16/F10 mouse melanoma cells. TGF-Î²1 treatment (48 h) elicited a concentration-dependent decrease in basal tyrosine hydroxylase and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) oxidase activities, to less than 30% of the control values but had no effect on dopachrome tautomerase activity (TRP-2). The inhibition affected to similar extents the Dopa oxidase activity associated to tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1) and tyrosinase. This inhibition was noticeable between 1 and 3 h after the addition of the cytokine, and maximal after 6 h of treatment. The decrease in the enzymatic activity was paralleled by a decrease in the abundance of the TRP-1 and tyrosinase proteins. TGF-Î²1 mediated this effect by increasing the rate of degradation of tyrosinase and TRP-1. Conversely, after 48 h of treatment, the expression of the tyrosinase gene decreased only slightly, while TRP-1 and TRP-2 gene expression was not affected.

Ras-mediated translocation to the plasma membrane represents a crucial step in the process of serum-stimulated Raf-1 kinase activation. The exact role of the multisite phosphorylation in Raf regulation, however, is not clear. We have previously reported that the mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf correlates with a reduction of serum-stimulated Raf kinase activity (Wartmann, M., and Davis, R. J.

Chem. 269, 6695-6701).Here we show that incubation of serum-starved CHO cells with D609, a purported inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, also results in a mobility shift of Raf-1 that is due to hyperphosphorylation on sites identical to those observed following mitogen stimulation. Subcellular fractionation analyses revealed that D609-induced mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation was paralleled by a decreased membrane association of Raf-1. Similar results were obtained in an in vitro reconstitution system. Furthermore, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of activation of the MAP kinase kinase MEK, prevented D609-induced Raf hyperphosphorylation and restored the amount of membrane-bound Raf to control levels.

Zhang X.F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The MAP kinases carry the signal to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate transcription factors capable of mediating changes in gene expression (6Davis R.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism(s) involved in Raf-1 regulation remain more obscure. The best understood aspects of Raf-1 kinase regulation are the initial events that precede its mitogen stimulation. Thus, growth factor receptor-induced activation of the mammalian nucleotide exchange factor mSOS, mediated by adapter proteins such as Shc and Grb2, stimulates the conversion of Ras from the inactive, GDP-bound state to the active, GTP-bound state. Activated Ras in turn directly interacts with Raf-1, resulting in the translocation of Raf from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. These conclusions are based on the findings that Raf-1 physically interacts with Ras (11Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A.

Importantly, Raf and Ras transiently interact in mammalian cells upon extracellular stimulation (18Hallberg B. Rayter S.I. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3913-3916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), providing a potential molecular basis for the transient membrane translocation of Raf observed in serum-stimulated cells (17Wartmann M. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6695-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physical interaction of Raf-1 with activated Ras in vitro, however, is insufficient for stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity (Ref. 19Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar; data not shown). Artificial plasma membrane localization, on the other hand, is sufficient for Raf kinase activation in a Ras-independent manner (15Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J.

Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that membrane localization of Raf-1 is necessary for its activation and that the role of Ras is to recruit Raf-1 to the membrane for activation by an as yet elusive mechanism.Hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 is a cellular response common to a wide range of physiological stimuli that activate the Raf-1/MEK/MAP kinase pathway and may be relevant to the process of Raf activity regulation (1Daum G.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 340 and 341 has been reported to be involved in the stimulation of Raf kinase activity in some cellular systems (21Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Escobedo J.A.

However, in many cellular systems, Raf kinase activation occurs in the apparent absence of Raf-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. In fact, even under circumstances when tyrosine phosphorylation is observed, the majority of phosphorylation events occur on serine residues (1Daum G. Eisenmann Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Thus, Raf-1 is phosphorylated in vivo at Ser-43, Ser-259, Ser-499, and Ser-621 (24Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 25McGrew B.R. Nichols D.W.

While constitutive phosphorylation at Ser-621 might be necessary for Raf functionality, phosphorylation at Ser-259 and Ser-499 has been implicated in the protein kinase C-mediated activation of Raf (24Kolch W.

Raf phosphorylated at Ser-43 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase displays a decreased affinity for Ras in vitro This could contribute to the negative regulation of the Raf-1/MEK-1/MAP kinase by cAMP-elevating agents observed in some cellular systems (28Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of Raf on Thr-269 mediated by a ceramide-activated protein kinase has been implicated in tumor necrosis factor-induced Raf kinase activation (29Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).The exact molecular relationship between these phosphorylation events and those that are associated with the characteristic retardation of the electrophoretic mobility of Raf-1 following stimuli that activate the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/MAP kinase pathway is not clear. Initial experiments employing serine/threonine-specific phosphatases suggested a causal relationship between serine/threonine phosphorylation and Raf mobility shift as well as Raf kinase activation (30Kovacina K.S.

We have previously observed that the kinetics of mitogen-stimulated Raf kinase activation and Raf mobility shift are poorly correlated events. Thus, while mitogen-stimulated Raf-1 kinase activation occurs rapidly and is transient in nature, the decrease in Raf-1 protein mobility only becomes apparent at later times and coincides with a marked attenuation of mitogen-stimulated Raf-1 kinase activity (17Wartmann M. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6695-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Here we show that the mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf is associated with a decreased affinity of this form of Raf for the plasma membrane. Since plasma membrane localization is a positive determinant for Raf kinase activity, this post-translational modification might represent a molecular mechanism accounting, at least in part, for the attenuation of Raf kinase activity following mitogen stimulation. We further demonstrate that hyperphosphorylation of Raf can be blocked by a specific inhibitor of MEK activation and that this correlates with restoration of plasma membrane-bound Raf to control levels. Thus, the mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf is likely a consequence of activating the downstream components in the MAP kinase cascade and might represent a negative feedback mechanism contributing to the desensitization of this signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONThe molecular mechanism(s) involved in the regulation of Raf-1 protein kinase activity are complex and still incompletely understood. The initial events leading to activation of Raf-1 seem to involve Ras-mediated membrane translocation and phosphorylation on tyrosine residues (21Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Escobedo J.A. Rapp U.R.

Despite the obvious physiological importance, little is known about the mechanism(s) involved in turning Raf-1 kinase âoff.â Treatment of cells with a wide range of physiological stimuli results in hyperphosphorylation of Raf. While phosphorylation and activation of Raf by protein kinase C (24Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R.

The nature and significance of these mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation events have been controversial. Although experiments with serine/threonine-specific phosphatases initially suggested a stimulatory role for these post-translational modifications of Raf-1 (30Kovacina K.S. Yonezawa K. Brautigan D.L.

While the more recent demonstration of Raf-1 kinase inactivation following phosphatase treatment was performed using the physiological Raf-1 substrate MEK, it was not demonstrated whether this correlated with corresponding changes in the electrophoretic mobility of Raf-1 (50Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).

Second, a comparison of the time course of activation and mobility shift of Raf in response to various agonists has shown that these processes are poorly correlated (17Wartmann M. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6695-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ueki K. Matsuda S. Tobe K. Gotoh Y. Tamemoto H. Yachi M. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Nishida E. Kadowaki T. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1994; 24: 2746-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, we have previously demonstrated that the transient activation of Raf protein kinase in response to serum stimulation of cells correlated with a transient membrane translocation of Raf and occurred in the absence of a Raf mobility shift. On the contrary, in accordance with the the kinetics of serum-stimulated Raf hyperphosphorylation presented here, the appearance of the Raf mobility shift correlated with an attenuation of Raf kinase activity and was paralleled by a reduction in the amount of membrane-associated Raf (17Wartmann M. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6695-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Here we show that mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf induced by treatment of cells with D609, a PC-PLC inhibitor, correlates with a decrease in membrane-localized Raf below that observed in untreated cells. The results obtained in the cell-free reconstitution experiments demonstrated that this phenomenon is not due to effects of D609 on the plasma membrane. Importantly, hyperphosphorylated Raf from serum-treated cells displayed a similar decreased tendency to localize to the membrane fraction in this in vitro assay. Furthermore, comparison of the phosphopeptide maps revealed no significant differences in the phosphorylation state of Raf in D609- and mitogen-stimulated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that negative modulation of membrane localization mediated by mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf represents an important molecular mechanism that could account, at least in part, for the attenuation of Raf kinase activity that follows its initial mitogen activation.The results presented here imply that mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation does not directly regulate the catalytic activity of Raf, but rather exerts its effect indirectly, by modulating the ability of Raf to associate with the plasma membrane, the residence of the elusive Raf-âactivating principle.â Consistent with this hypothesis, dephosphorylation of mobility-shifted Raf, isolated from D609 or serum-treated cells, by incubation with either of the serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases PP1 or PP2A, did not significantly alter the in vitro protein kinase activity of Raf (data not shown). Thus, total cellular Raf kinase activity might be the result of the stimulus-independent intrinsic catalytic activity of Raf and a component determined by the stimulus-dependent levels of a membrane-localized âactivating principle,â such as a putative lipid co-factor. Following serum starvation, the levels of this âactivating principleâ are likely low, but not necessarily absent. Fluctuations in the levels of the Raf activator in serum-starved cells might explain the varying degrees of reduction (0-89%) below basal Raf kinase activity observed in D609-treated cells. In serum-stimulated cells, on the other hand, the level of the Raf activator is likely significantly increased and might account for the intermediate, rather than basal or reduced, Raf kinase activity of mobility-shifted Raf observed at later times following mitogen stimulation.It has previously been demonstrated in NIH3T3 cells that inhibition of endogenous PC-PLC by D609 blocks activation of Raf-1 in response to mitogenic growth factors (56Cai H. Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Diaz Meco M.T. Sithanandam G. Rapp U.R. Moscat J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7645-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to our results obtained with CHO cells, Cai et al. (56Cai H. Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Diaz Meco M.T. Sithanandam G. Rapp U.R. Moscat J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7645-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) failed to observe a Raf-1 mobility shift in response to treatment of serum-starved NIH3T3 cells with D609. This is probably due to the different cell system or the higher concentration of D609 (35 Î¼g/ml) used in their experiments. While we observed a pronounced Raf protein mobility shift at low concentrations of D609, the shift was less pronounced at higher concentrations (>35 Î¼g/ml; Fig. 1A). Thus, the inhibition of serum-stimulated Raf-1 kinase activation at concentrations of D609 higher than 35 Î¼g/ml might not rely on the effect of hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 proposed here but might be the consequence of inhibiting mitogen-stimulated PC-PLC activity. Furthermore, it remains to be established whether the D609-induced hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 reported here is a consequence of inhibition of PC-PLC or whether D609 modulates targets distinct from PC-PLC.Several recent reports support the hypothesis that mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf is a feedback consequence of activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Hormone-induced activation of an estrogen-dependent form of oncogenic Raf-1, stably expressed in quiescent 3T3 cells, resulted in increased activity of MEK and, to a lesser extent, MAP kinase. Under these conditions, a mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of the endogenous pool of Raf-1 was observed without a concomitant stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity (32Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Ueki et al. (33Ueki K. Matsuda S. Tobe K. Gotoh Y. Tamemoto H. Yachi M. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Nishida E. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15756-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of MAP kinase in CHO cells overexpressing human insulin receptor (CHO/IR) led to hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1, which, significantly, was accompanied by a decrease in the MEK kinase activity of Raf-1. The clearest evidence arguing for an involvement of MEK or a downstream component in the hyperphosphorylation of Raf, however, has been provided by the demonstration that blocking activation of MEK by PD98059, or by overexpression of a dominant negative MEK mutant, abolishes the insulin-stimulated mobility shift of Raf in CHO/IR cells (57Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.-J. Guan K.-L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20883-20886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Alessi et al. (48Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PD98059 blocks the platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated hyperphosphorylation of Raf and, interestingly, prevents the attenuation of Raf kinase activity that occurred following its initial stimulation. Here, by the use of an agent that activates MAP kinase pathway components downstream of Raf in a PD968059-sensitive manner, we present further evidence in favor of the hypothesis that mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf in response to mitogens, and probably other stimuli, occurs in a negative feedback manner. First, time course analyses demonstrated that D609- and FCS-stimulated activation of ERK2 precedes, rather than ensues, the appearance of mobility-shifted Raf. The fact that D609-induced activation of ERK2 and hyperphosphorylation of Raf is PD98059-sensitive strongly suggests the involvement of a component of the MAP kinase pathway at a point distal to Raf in this phenomenon. While MEK-1 is unable to phosphorylate recombinant Raf-1 in vitro (data not shown) and thus is an unlikely Raf-1 kinase kinase, the classical MAP kinase isoforms are able to phosphorylate Raf-1 in vitro (Refs. 58Lee R. Cobb M.H. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1088-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 59Anderson N.G. Li P. Marsden L.A. Williams N. Roberts T.M. Sturgill T.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar; data not shown). While this is consistent with MAP kinase being a potential mediator of Raf-1 hyperphosphorylation in vivo, phosphorylation of Raf-1 by the classical MAP kinases in vitro fails to cause the characteristic mobility shift of Raf-1 (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that the putative Raf kinase kinase responsible for mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf lies downstream of ERK2. The molecular mechanism of how D609 leads to the activation of ERK2 (and MEK; data not shown) and whether D609 affects additional components in this pathway remains to be established. Differential modulation of component(s) downstream of ERK2 by D609 and FCS might explain the observation that, while D609 and FCS stimulated ERK2 activity with similar kinetics, the time course of appearance of mobility-shifted Raf elicited by D609 was somewhat slower than that induced by FCS.PKA phosphorylates Raf-1 on sites that either negatively affect the Raf-1/Ras interaction (i.e. Ser-43) or inhibit the catalytic activity of Raf (28Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). PKA is thus a potential Raf kinase kinase whose activation might account for the phenomenon reported here. Indeed, comparison of the phosphopeptide maps presented here with those reported by Morrison and co-workers (26Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that D609 as well as serum induce the phosphorylation of Raf on Ser-43 (Fig. 2, phosphopeptide 1 and/or 2). However the in vivo phosphorylation of this site is probably not mediated by PKA, since we di"

In this paper we report experiments to study the primary structures of the low molecular weight proteins of the isolated PSII reaction center complex with a view to identifying post-translational modifications, including the effect of illumination under conditions when singlet oxygen is being produced. We have employed a combination of fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and electrospray-mass spectrometry. These methodologies have not been used extensively for characterizing membrane proteins because of the problem of contaminating detergents. During the course of this work we have therefore developed procedures to overcome this problem. The PSII reaction center, consisting of the D1 and D2 proteins, the Î± and Î² subunits of cytochrome b559, and the product of the psbI gene, was isolated from pea thylakoid membranes as described by Nanba and Satoh (13Nanba O.

Methods in Plant Biochemistry. Academic Press, London1990: 171-193Google Scholar). Irradiation of RCII complexes was performed in a thermostatic cuvette maintained at 4Â°C, using heat-filtered white light at 4000 microeinsteins mâ2 sâ1 for 15 min. The sample was suspended in 30 mM MES, 0.4 M sucrose, and 2 mM n-dodecyl-Î²-maltoside (pH 6.0) at a chlorophyll concentration of 100 Î¼g mlâ1. Partial separation of the PSII reaction center proteins was effected using a Spherisorb Aquapore RP-300 (220 Ã 4.6-mm) column fitted to a Kontron HPLC system (Datasystem 450, HPLC pump 420, detector 430, and mixer M800). Reaction center preparations were dialyzed against 2 Ã 2.0 liters of aqueous 5% acetic acid at 4Â°C for 16-24 h and were injected directly onto the column. The column was held at 100% A (aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) followed by a linear increase to 100% B (90% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 60 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml minâ1. Elution was monitored at 214 and 280 nm, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. Partial separation of the polypeptides produced by enzymatic digestion was effected using the above system and conditions except that the Aquapore RP-300 (220 Ã 4.6-mm) column was replaced by an Aquapore OD-300. Lyophilized protein samples were redissolved in 200 Î¼l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) and digested with trypsin for 6 h at 37Â°C, using an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). The reaction was terminated by freezing followed by lyophilization. Lyophilized protein samples were resuspended in 200 Î¼l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) and digested with chymotrypsin for 3 h at 37Â°C, using an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). The reaction was terminated by freezing followed by lyophilization. Lyophilized protein samples were resuspended in 100 Î¼l of a solution of CNBr in 70% formic acid and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 5 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 5 volumes of water followed by freezing and lyophilization. In the case of samples to be analyzed by gas phase sequencing, the solution of CNBr in 70% formic acid was applied to protein present on polybrene-coated glass fiber discs and incubated overnight. The acid and CNBr were removed under a stream of nitrogen, and the glass fiber disc was submitted to gas phase sequence analysis (see below). Methanolic HCl reagent was prepared by bubbling HCl gas into methanol until the solution became warm. After cooling, a 100-Î¼l aliquot of this reagent was added to the dried sample, which was then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by drying under a stream of nitrogen. Acetylation of free amino groups was carried out using a solution of 3 volumes of methanol, 1 volume of acetic anhydride. The samples to be derivatized were dried in glass tubes and resuspended in 10 Î¼l of milli-Q water (purified by MilliporeÂ® system), and 40 Î¼l of the acetylation reagent was added to each tube and left for 1 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by drying under a stream of nitrogen. The samples for manual sequencing were dried down in a glass tube and redissolved in 100 Î¼l of milli-Q water. 100 Î¼l of a 5% solution of phenylisothiocynate in pyridine was added to each sample, and the coupling reaction was flushed with nitrogen prior to its incubation at 45Â°C. After 1 h, this reaction was terminated by removing excess reagents under a stream of nitrogen. To each of the dried samples 100 Î¼l of trifluoroacetic acid was added, and the mixtures were incubated for a further 10 min at 45Â°C, causing the cleavage of the phenylthiocarbamyl-labeled terminal amino acid as the thiohydantoin derivative. The remaining truncated peptide products were subsequently dried under nitrogen and analyzed by MS. Peptides were Edman-degraded using a CI 4000 gas phase protein sequencer, and the standard protein sequencing method was used (15Findlay J.B.C. Pappin D.J.C. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Geisow M.J. Protein Sequencing: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 69-84Google Scholar). Samples which failed to give sequence information were digested on the glass fiber disc by CNBr as described above. FAB mass spectra were acquired using a Fisons VG ZAB 2SE 2FPD mass spectrometer fitted with a cesium ion gun operating at 30 kV. The instrument was calibrated using CsI clusters. Data acquisition and processing were performed using VG Analytical Opus software. Dried peptide samples were dissolved either in aqueous 5% acetic acid or in 40% propan-1-ol in aqueous 5% acetic (for the more hydrophobic peptides), and 1-Î¼l aliquots were loaded onto the probe that had been previously treated with a 1:1 mixture of glycerol: monothioglycerol. ES-MS spectra of the intact reaction center proteins and their digestion products were obtained by direct injection of 10-Î¼l aliquots of HPLC-purified samples into the ion source of a VG Bio-Q triple quadrupole electrospray mass spectrometer. The instrument was operated using a carrier flow buffer of 90% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, propan-1-ol, and 2 methoxyethanol in a 1:1:1:1 (v/v/v/v) ratio at a flow rate of 5 Î¼l minâ1. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using a solution of horse myoglobin (1 pm Î¼lâ1), to give average chemical molecular masses for the signals observed. MALDI mass spectra were acquired using a Fisons VG ZAB 2SE 2FPD mass spectrometer, fitted with a UV laser (337 nm). The instrument was calibrated using CsI clusters. Data acquisition and processing were performed using VG Analytical Opus software. The samples were dissolved in 60% propan-1-ol in 5% aqueous acetic acid and 1-Î¼l aliquots were loaded onto a probe that had been treated with a saturated solution of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid made up in a 35:65 (v/v) mixture of 90% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The successful application of MS in protein sequencing largely depends on the availability of purified sample, relatively free of salt and detergents. We have developed a highly efficient reverse phase HPLC protocol to isolate the three small subunits present in PSII reaction centers in conditions amenable for MS analysis. The first step of the procedure involves the dialysis of reaction center preparations into 5% aqueous acetic acid using a 50-kDa cut-off membrane (see âExperimental Proceduresâ for details). This crucial step assists in slowly removing salts and detergents introduced during the original isolation of the PSII reaction center complexes while avoiding precipitation of the extremely hydrophobic transmembrane proteins under investigation. The smaller subunits of the PSII reaction center complex were then separated from the dialyzed samples to near base-line resolution by using aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile in a gradient HPLC elution system. The HPLC profile generated for dark (control) reaction center preparations using the above protocol is shown in Fig. 1A At a wavelength of 214 nm, three main absorbance peaks, at retention times of 44.8, 55.4, and 64.4 min, were detected. The HPLC fractions corresponding to these regions of UV absorbance were analyzed by direct injection into the ES-mass spectrometer over a period of 2 min. After transformation, the ES spectra (Fig. 2, A-C) of fractions 45, 55, and 64 gave molecular masses of 4394.6 Â± 0.6, 9283.6 Â± 0.7, and 4209.5 Â± 0.5 Da, respectively. The calculated masses of the Î±- and Î²-subunits of cytochrome b559 and the PSII-I protein based on their DNA sequences are 9414.6 Da (pea), 4424.2 Da (pea), and 4167.8 Da (tobacco, wheat, and mustard), respectively (legends to Tables I, II, and III). In all cases, the experimentally obtained mass diverges from the computed mass. Previous sequencing studies have revealed that both the Î²-subunit and the psbI gene product are NH2-terminally blocked in the proteins derived from spinach plants (16Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and pea plants (17Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 259-262Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but the identities of these modifications were not determined. The DNA sequence of the psbI gene from pea plants has not been obtained, although the nucleotide sequences from other organisms including rice, wheat, mustard, liverwort, and tobacco are available. A partial amino acid sequence (residues 2-16) has been determined for the pea PSII-I subunit (17Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 259-262Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, the lack of a complete psbI sequence for pea and the nature of the NH2-terminal post-translational modification make it impossible to calculate an expected molecular mass for this polypeptide. Similarly, NH2-terminal modification of the Î²-subunit also prevents theoretical calculation of its exact molecular mass. The unambiguous assignment and characterization of the structural changes attributable to the mass discrepancies of the three main isolated components was achieved by subsequent MS mapping studies. In addition to the major UV absorbance peaks discussed above, there are also two relatively small UV peaks observed in the chromatogram, at 42.4 and 48.0 min. These components have been identified by a combination of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and MS studies as minor contaminants of dodecyl maltoside and CP proteins (chlorophyll-binding proteins), respectively.Fig. 2Electrospray mass spectra of HPLC fractions 45 (A), 55 (B), and 64 (C), isolated from dark PSII reaction center preparations (see Fig. 1A). These components were subsequently assigned to the Î²-subunit of cytochrome b559, Î±-subunit of cytochrome b559, and PSII-I protein, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ICytochrome psbF gene product from Pisum sativum (pea) (31Willey D.L.

Two main quasimolecular ions (M + H)+ were observed at m/z 996.4 and 2890.4 in the spectrum. The exact mass correlation of the signal at m/z 996.4 with that calculated for the tryptic peptide Thr6-Arg13 (Table I legend) of the Î²-subunit provided the first evidence identifying this polypeptide as a cytochrome b559 subunit rather than the PSII-I protein, which does not contain a tryptic peptide of this mass. Three peptides in total are expected to be generated by tryptic digestion of the Î²-subunit. The anticipated molecular mass for the C-terminal peptide is m/z 2830.4, and the absence of this signal and the concomitant detection of a molecular ion with a 60-atomic mass unit increment, m/z 2890.4, suggests the presence of molecular modifications between Trp14 and Arg39. The molecular ion corresponding to the NH2-terminal tryptic product, Thr2-Arg5 (initiation of this protein at the second residue was suggested by previous sequencing studies (17Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 259-262Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar)) was not observed in the FAB map possibly due to the suppression of the molecular ion corresponding to this peptide. To generate a complete map of the protein, the individual tryptic peptides of the Î²-subunit of cytochrome b559 were isolated by reverse phase HPLC. The four main UV absorbance peaks observed were screened by FAB-MS, and molecular masses were determined for three of these components (Table I). Subsequently, the purified products were subjected to automated gas phase sequencing. The NH2-terminal sequence obtained for the component eluting at 30.7 min (996.4 Da) was Thr-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Phe-Thr-Val-Arg, while that derived from the component eluting at 41.9 min (2890.4 Da) was Trp-Leu-Ala-Val-His-Gly-Leu-Ala-Val-Pro-Thr-Val-Phe-Phe. These results confirm the assignments of these components as tryptic peptides of the Î²-subunit of cytochrome b559, Thr6-Arg13 and Trp14-Arg39, respectively. Importantly, the sequence generated from the smaller peptide (Thr6-Arg13) matches exactly with the DNA sequence, while the sequence obtained from the larger peptide (Trp14-Arg39) diverges from the DNA derived amino acid sequence at residue 26, where the expected serine is in fact a phenylalanine. The nucleic acid codons of these two amino acids differ only in one base position. The DNA sequence may thus be in error, or as has recently been described in the sequence of spinach Î²-subunit, mRNA editing could have taken place (20Bock R. Hagermann R. KÃ¶ssel H. Kudla J. J. Mol. Genet. 1993; 240: 238-244Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This substitution would result in a 60-atomic mass unit increase on the molecular weight of this peptide and thus corresponds to the mass discrepancy observed. FAB-MS analysis of the absorbance peak at 21.0 min in the chromatogram of the tryptic digestion on the Î²-subunit of cytochrome b559 did not yield any significant mass signals. This component was believed to be the as yet unidentified NH2-terminal tryptic peptide, Thr2-Arg5. It is well known that small hydrophilic peptides can often escape detection by FAB-MS due to suppression effects (35Morris H.R. Panico M. Barber M. Bordoli R.S. Sedwick R.D. Tyler A.N. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This phenomenon can usually be overcome by using chemical derivatization to increase the hydrophobicity of analytes. Carboxyesterification, which results in the modification of the free carboxyl groups to esters, was used in this study. From its predicted sequence it is anticipated that there are two free carboxyl groups on the peptide Thr2-Arg5: one at the C terminus and the other due to Asp4. The quasimolecular ion derived from esterification of this peptide would thus be expected at m/z 532.2. Only one molecular ion, m/z 574.2, was detected in the spectrum derived from the derivatized sample. The 42-atomic mass unit difference between these signals implies the presence of an acetyl group on the peptide. This modification is believed to correspond to the NH2-terminal blocking group that had been detected but not identified during amino acid sequencing of the Î²-subunit (17Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 259-262Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Barbato R. Friso G. Rigoni F. Frizzo A. Giacometti G.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and therefore is most probably located on the amino group of residue Thr2. Further confirmation of the structure ascribed to the Î²-subunit was accomplished by a chymotryptic FAB map of this component (Fig. 3). The amino acid substitution at residue 26 was suggested by the molecular ions at m/z 803.3, 1100.3, 1223.4, and 1497.5. These signals have been assigned to Gly19-Phe26, Phe27-Phe36, Leu15-Phe26, and Phe27-Arg39. They each correspond to chymotryptic digestion products created by cleavage at Phe26. The presence of the second modification on the Î²-subunit, the NH2-terminal acetylation, was also confirmed by the mass shift of the chymotryptic product giving rise to the molecular ion at m/z 1167.3. This signal is 42 atomic mass units larger than that expected for peptide Thr2-Phe10. Corroboration of the other mass signals, m/z 1237.4 and 1350.5, with those expected from peptides Gly29-Arg39 and Leu28-Arg39, respectively, indicates that there are no other modifications in these regions. The map of the Î²-subunit of cytochrome b559 generated by chymotryptic digestion covers the whole protein molecule. The Î±-subunit of cytochrome b559 is the only reaction center constituent that is expected in the 9-kDa mass range. Based on its DNA sequence, an average chemical mass of 9414.6 Da was calculated for this component (Table II legend); however, amino acid sequencing studies have indicated that the initiating methionine residue of this protein is proteolytically removed (17Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 259-262Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), leading to an expected molecular mass of 9283.5 Da. The close correlation (0.1 Da) between the predicted and experimentally determined molecular mass leads to the putative assignment of the HPLC-purified component eluting at 55.4 min as the Î±-subunit of cytochrome b559 (des-Met). Confirmation of this assignment was obtained by mapping studies on the HPLC-purified component. Direct FAB-MS analysis of the products generated by tryptic digestion shows four molecular ions at m/z 954.6, 1122.7, 1485.8, and 2422.5. All these masses can be assigned to expected trypsin-induced peptides of the Î±-subunit of cytochrome b559: Gln61-Arg69, Ser9-Arg18, Phe70-Arg81, and Gln61-Arg81, respectively (Table II legend). Following reverse phase purification of the tryptic digest, fractions containing UV absorbances were screened by FAB-MS and ES-MS, and the results are presented in Table II. The UV absorbances can be related to expected tryptic peptides that map the entire Î±-subunit (residues 2-81) except for residues 82 and 83, and all of these assignments have been confirmed by automated gas phase sequencing. Direct FAB-MS analysis of the products generated by tryptic digestion on the HPLC-purified component eluting at 64.4 min indicates the presence of two main digestion products, at m/z 3528.2 and 3952.6, and the intact polypeptide, at m/z 4210.7 (Table III). Since neither of these signals can be directly correlated to expected tryptic products from the Î²-subunit of cytochrome b559, it seemed likely that the component under investigation was the psbI gene product. This suggestion was further verified by the fact that mass differences between the molecular weight of the undigested product (m/z 4210.7) and the two digestion products (m/z 3528.2 and 3952.6) correspond to the molecular weights of the tryptic peptides that would be generated by cleavage at either of the two arginine residues in the C-terminal domain (residues 30 and 34) of the psbI gene product predicted from tobacco, mustard, and wheat DNA sequences (Table III legend). On this basis, the observed molecular ions at m/z 3952.6 can be provisionally assigned to the modified PSII-I peptide residues equivalent to Met1-Arg34, while m/z 3528.2 would correspond to the modified PSII-I peptide equivalent to Met1-Arg30. The tryptic digestion products of the PSII-I protein were then carboxyesterified prior to FAB-MS analysis. The results shown"
https://openalex.org/W1982641958,"We have identified two yeast genes with similarity to a human cDNA encoding acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). Deletion of both yeast genes results in a viable cell with undetectable esterified sterol (Yang, H., Bard, M., Bruner, D. A., Gleeson, A., Deckelbaum, R. J., Aljinovic, G., Pohl, T., Rothstein, R., and Sturley, S. L. (1996) Science 272, 1353-1356). Here, we expressed the human cDNA in the yeast double mutant, resulting in high level production of ACAT protein, but low in vivo esterification of ergosterol, the predominant yeast sterol. The activity of the human enzyme was increased by incubation of these cells with 25-hydroxy, cholesterol, an established positive regulator of mammalian sterol esterification. In contrast, the yeast enzymes were unaffected by this reagent. In vitro microsomal assays indicated no sterol esterification in extracts from the double mutant. However, significant activity was detected from strains expressing human ACAT when cholesterol was equilibrated with the microsomal membranes. The human enzyme in yeast utilized cholesterol as the preferred sterol and was sensitive to competitive (S58035) and non-competitive (DuP 128) ACAT inhibitors. The yeast esterifying enzymes exhibited a diminished sterol substrate preference and were sensitive only to S58035. Human ACAT had a broad acyl-CoA substrate specificity, the other substrate for this reaction. By contrast, the yeast enzymes had a marked preference for specific acyl-CoAs, particularly unsaturated C18 forms. These results confirm the yeast genes as functional homologs of the human gene and demonstrate that the enzymes confer substrate specificity to the esterification reaction in both organisms.

Free sterols are essential components of all eukaryotic membranes and exert a major influence on membrane fluidity and permeability and the activity of membrane-bound proteins (2Bloch K.E. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 14: 47-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The esterification of sterol, i.e. the conjugation of fatty acids with sterols, plays an important role in sterol homeostasis, since it converts excess free sterol into a cytoplasmic storage form. In human cells, this esterification reaction is mediated by the enzyme, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT (3Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cadigan K.M. Trends Cadiovasc. Med. 1994; 4: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). 1The abbreviation used is: ACATacyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase. ACAT activity has been localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is present in all tissues tested (4Suckling K.E. Stange E.F. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 647-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACAT has several physiological functions with possible pathological consequences. In addition to maintaining intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, the ACAT reaction has been suggested to be involved in absorption of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen (5Field F.J. Kam N.T. Mathur S.N. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 539-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cholesterol ester synthesis rate in the liver may affect the secretion of very low density lipoprotein and thus plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels (6Huff M.W. Telford D.E. Barrett P.H.R. Billheimer J.T. Gillies P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1498-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In adrenal cells, cholesterol ester is a sterol source for acute steroid hormone production. Most profoundly, the up-regulation of ACAT in macrophages and smooth muscle cells, accompanied by the accumulation of cholesterol ester in the arterial wall (foam cells), is an early event in the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque (7Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9910) Google Scholar, 8Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase. Based on these functions of ACAT, pharmacological inhibitors of the esterification reaction have been proposed and developed as potential hypocholesterolemic and anti-atherogenic agents (9Billheimer J. Wilde R. Tarr I.J. Anti-atherosclerotic Agents Current Patents Ltd. Current Patents Ltd.,, London, United Kingdom1991: B5-B19Google Scholar, 10Sliskovic D.R. White A.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 194-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Such inhibitors could reduce cholesterol uptake in the intestine, increase the conversion of free cholesterol to bile acids in the liver, reduce very low density lipoprotein secretion, and decrease the accumulation of cholesterol ester in cells in the vascular wall. Despite the strong inhibitory effect of these compounds in vitro and in animal models, they have not been efficacious in lowering serum cholesterol in human trials (11Hainer J.W. Terry J. Connell B.

Whether the absorbable ACAT inhibitors may prevent foam cell formation is currently unknown. Sandoz 58035, one of the first specific ACAT inhibitors, is a competitive fatty acid homologue (14Ross A.C. Go K.J. Heider J.G. Rothblatt G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 815-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while DuP 128 is a potent, non-competitive inhibitor of the reaction (IC50 of 10 nm (15Cromley D. Higley C. Wexler R. Robinson C. Gillies P. Ninth International Symposium on Atherosclerosis October, 1993. 1991; 184Google Scholar, 16Higley C. Wilde R. Maduskuie T. Johnson A. Pennev P. Billheimer J. Robinson C. Gillies P. Wexler R. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 3511-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). Compounds such as these, which inhibit mammalian ACAT by different mechanisms, may be useful in studying esterification in other organisms, and thus afford a more thorough overall understanding of the ACAT reaction. The sterol esterification reaction is conserved from yeast to humans (17Billheimer J.T. Gillies P.J. Esfahani M. Swaney J.B. Advances in Cholesterol Research. Telford Press, Philadelphia, PA1992Google Scholar). In each organism, the predominant sterol is structurally distinct. In mammalian cells, the major sterol source is cholesterol; in yeast, it is ergosterol. Microsomal preparations from rat liver exhibit marked specificity of the ACAT reaction for cholesterol. Notably, the reaction was very sensitive to changes in the sterol side chain; the addition of a 24-Î²-methyl group, as in ergosterol, resulted in esterification at about 5% the rate of cholesterol. In contrast, yeast microsomal preparations esterified both ergosterol and cholesterol to similar extents (18Tavani D. Nes W. Billheimer J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 774-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The predominant fatty acyl-CoA in each species has not been as well studied. However, an order of preference for the rat liver enzyme was established as oleoyl > palmitoyl > stearoyl > linoleoyl-CoA (19Goodman D.S. Deykin D. Shiratori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1335-1345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the ACAT homologs in different species prefer one particular acyl-CoA substrate over others is unknown. A comprehensive understanding of the ACAT reaction and the further development of useful ACAT inhibitors has been hampered by the inability to biochemically purify the ACAT enzyme to homogeneity. A human macrophage ACAT cDNA has recently been identified (20Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By homology searching with this sequence as a probe, we identified two yeast ACAT homologs, ARE1 and ARE2 (for ACAT related enzymes 1 and 2, respectively). 2These genes were subsequently named SAT2 and SAT1, respectively (21Yu C.

For clarity, the Stanford Saccharomyces Genome Database has decided that the ARE acronym should be utilized hereon. Disruption of these genes produced a viable yeast cell with no detectable sterol ester (1Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the current study, we determined the relative enzyme activities of Are1p and Are2p using a microsomal in vitro sterol esterification assay. Subsequently, we successfully expressed a human ACAT cDNA in the are1â are2â yeast strain. This facilitated the comparison of sterol and acyl-CoA substrate specificities and inhibitor sensitivities of the yeast and human enzymes. Congenic yeast strains with deletions in the yeast homologs of human ACAT, ARE1 and ARE2, have been described previously (1Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Four strains of common genetic background (can1-100, his3-11, 15, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, ura3-1) were used: SCY059 (MATÎ±, met14ÎHpaI-SalI, are1ÎNA::HIS3, are2Î::LEU2), SCY060 (MATÎ±, ade2-1, are1ÎNA::HIS3), SCY061 (MATa, met14ÎHpaI-SalI, are2Î::LEU2), and SCY062 (MATa, ade2-1). Transformation of yeast was performed with lithium acetate by amino acid prototrophy selection (22Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast extract, Yeast Nitrogen Base, Bacto-peptone, and Bacto-agar were from Difco; D-dextrose, D-galactose, and D-raffinose were from Sigma. Complete (YEPD), synthetic complete (SC), or SC lacking uracil (SC-ura) media were prepared as described (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar, 24Sherman F. Hicks J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Competent cells of Escherichia coli strain DH5Î± (Life Technologies, Inc.) and DNA modifying enzymes (Promega) were used according to the manufacturers instructions. The human ACAT cDNA sequence was obtained from a human leukocyte cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction amplification as described (25Wang H. Germain S.J. Benfield P.P. Gillies P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction fragment corresponding to the coding region flanked by NotI and ApaI sites was subcloned into the pCMV vector (Invitrogen) at the same sites. The pCMV vector containing ACAT was cut with ApaI and made blunt ended by T4 DNA polymerase treatment and then digested with NotI. The ensuing fragment contains a full-length human ACAT open reading frame with the translation initiation codon four bases away from the NotI site. The yeast shuttle vector pRS-426-GAL was cut by SacI and blunt ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and then digested by NotI. The NotI, ApaI fragment containing ACAT and the linearized vector were ligated by T4 DNA ligase to construct the ACAT expression vector pRS426-ACAT. This placed the ACAT open reading frame directly downstream of the yeast GAL1/10 promoter (Fig. 1A). Yeast cells were grown overnight in SC-ura dextrose (2%) liquid medium. Cells were harvested at mid-log phase and washed with sterile water twice. The cells were resuspended in 10 ml of SC-ura medium containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose and grown overnight. Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads in 0.01 M borate, 0.15 M NaCl and resuspension of the low speed pellet in 1% SDS, 5 M urea. Denaturing gel electrophoresis (5 Î¼g of total protein per lane) was performed using 12% polyacrylamide for the resolving gel in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation, the proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked in 5% non-fat milk in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 137 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and probed with 0.28 Î¼g/ml of the DM10 Î±ACAT antibody (27Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in TBST, 1% non-fat milk for 1 h. Detection of the immune complexes was attained using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody and the ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham). Yeast strains containing pRS426-ACAT or vector control were grown in 5 ml of SC-ura (2% glucose) medium to a density of 107 cells/ml. The cells were harvested, washed twice with sterile water, and then resuspended in 10 ml of SC-ura media containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose. For experiments to test the effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol on sterol esterification, 10 or 25 Î¼g/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol in ethanol was added to the growth medium at this point. After 4 h, 1 Î¼Ci/ml [3H]oleate in tyloxapol/ethanol (1:1) was added and cells were pulsed for a further 4 h. Total lipids were prepared and analyzed as described (1Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Incorporation of label into ergosterol ester was determined after scintillation counting and normalization to a [14C]cholesterol internal standard and the dry weight of the cells. The data is expressed as means of triplicate assays over at least two experiments with the corresponding standard deviations. Yeast cells containing pRS426-ACAT or the vector control were grown in 5 ml of SC-ura media containing 2% glucose to a density of about 108 cells/ml. The cultures were diluted to 500 ml of SC-ura media containing 2% glucose and grown overnight. The cells were harvested, washed twice with sterile water, and then resuspended in 500 ml of ura-CM media containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose and allowed to grow for 6 h before freezing as a cell pellet. Frozen yeast pellets were quick-thawed at 37Â°C, washed in 2 Ã pellet volumes of homogenization buffer (HB: 0.1 M potassium phosphate, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM glutathione, 20 Î¼M leupeptin, 10 Î¼g/ml benzamidine, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and spun at 2,000 Ã g to re-pellet cells. The supernatant was removed and another 2 volumes of HB added to resuspend the cells. The suspension was shaken with intermittent cooling in the presence of 1.0 g of 0.5-mm diameter glass beads in a mini-beadbeater (Biospec Products) at 5,000 rpm for 3 Ã 1-min intervals. The resulting homogenate was spun at 1,000 Ã g for 5 min and 15,000 Ã g for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and spun at 105,000 Ã g for 1 h to pellet the microsomes. This pellet was resuspended in ACAT buffer (0.1 M potassium phosphate, 1 mM GSH, pH 7.4) and protein concentration determined (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomes were aliquoted and frozen at â70Â°C. Rat liver microsomes were prepared as described previously (29Billheimer J.T. Tavani D. Nes W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined by the rate of incorporation of [14C]oleoyl-CoA or [14C]cholesterol into steryl ester (29Billheimer J.T. Tavani D. Nes W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The standard assay, in duplicate or triplicate, contained 200 Î¼g of microsomal protein, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin, 20 nmol of oleoyl-CoA, and 20 Î¼g of cholesterol in a final volume of 200 Î¼l of 0.1 M potassium phosphate butter, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM glutathione. In control assays, labeled oleoyl-CoA or [14C]cholesterol was added after the reaction had been stopped. In assays where inhibitors were tested, the inhibitors were added in 5 Î¼l of Me2SO and compared to a solvent control of 5 Î¼l of Me2SO. S58035 and DuP 128 were used at a concentrations of 50 and 0.5 Î¼M, respectively. For experiments on substrate preferences utilizing [14C]oleoyl-CoA (30,000 dpm/nmol), cold sterols were included whereas those utilizing [14C]cholesterol (40,000 dpm/nmol) used unlabeled acyl-CoAs. Where added, sterols were suspended in reaction buffer with the aid of Triton WR-1339 at a ratio of 30:1 (Triton/sterol, w/w) (29Billheimer J.T. Tavani D. Nes W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After preincubation for 15 min at 37Â°C, the reaction was initiated by the addition of oleoyl-CoA. The assay was stopped after 2.5 min by the addition of 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1). Phase separation was induced by the addition of water (800 Î¼l) and [3H]cholesteryl oleate (30,000 dpm) and 15 Î¼g of cholesteryl oleate were added as the internal standard and carrier, respectively. The chloroform layer containing the lipids was dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 100 Î¼l of chloroform for spotting on ITLC-SA thin layer plates (Gelman Sciences). Lipids were separated and quantitated as described above. The specific activity of ACAT was determined as picomoles of either cholesterol or oleoyl-CoA converted to steryl ester/min/mg of protein. To initiate a molecular analysis of sterol esterification in the eukaryotic micro-organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), we identified two yeast gene products that exhibit significant structural and functional homology to the putative catalytic component of cholesterol esterification in human macrophages. We have shown that deletion of these genes produces a yeast cell lacking sterol ester (see Ref. 1Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). To confirm that these genes encode catalytic components of the esterification complex we isolated microsomes from wild type, single and double areâ mutant yeast strains. The in vitro measurements of sterol esterification essentially mirrored the assays performed in vivo Deletion of both ARE1 and ARE2 produces a strain devoid of microsomal ACAT activity. ARE1 encodes the minor isoform in terms of its contribution to esterification, whereas Are2p is the major esterification enzyme (â¼80% of wild-type), in vitro and in vivo The activity of the yeast isoforms in wild-type cells was elevated 2-3-fold after equilibration of exogenous cholesterol into microsomes prior to the assay (not shown). This increase in activity is similar to that observed in rat liver microsomes (29Billheimer J.T. Tavani D. Nes W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To compare and contrast the esterification activities conferred by the yeast and human enzymes, we expressed a human ACAT cDNA originally isolated from macrophages. The cDNA was fused to the divergent inducible promoter from the yeast GAL1/GAL10 genes in pRS426-ACAT as described above (Fig. 1A). A conditional promoter (in this case induced by galactose) was used to circumvent possible toxicity of high level expression of human ACAT in yeast. In fact, no toxicity was observed. The plasmid was used to transform ARE1 are2â, are1â ARE2, are1â are2â, and wild-type yeast strains. Transformants were incubated overnight in SC-ura, galactose/raffinose to induce expression of hACAT. Proteins were prepared and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with DM10 anti-ACAT antibody. A protein of approximately 48 kDa was detected under inducing conditions in the ACAT expressing strain and not in the non-expressing strain (vector control, Fig. 1B). The size of the protein is smaller than the predicted size of the ACAT primary translation product (63.8 kDa) but co-migrates with proteins isolated from mouse adrenal microsomes, consistent with previous reports (27Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Cheng D. Chang C.C.Y. Qu X. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The lower molecular weight species is most likely a degradation product of the hACAT protein; it is detectable in the mouse adrenal extracts on darker exposure (not shown), and is also observed in preparations described elsewhere (27Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). ACAT expressing strains were assayed in vivo for their ability to esterify endogenous yeast sterols (primarily ergosterol). Despite the high level expression of hACAT protein there were no alterations in incorporation of [14C]oleate into sterol ester in wild type or single ARE mutant yeast cells. However, in the are1â are2â double disruption strain expressing pRS426-ACAT, a low but significant esterification activity was detected at about 4% of a wild type yeast cell (Fig. 2A). The activity endowed by the hACAT construct was further confirmed as genuine when it was observed to increase in response to incubation of the cells with 25-OH cholesterol (Fig. 2B). Despite this, the level of activity was not commensurate with the mass of protein observed in the immunoblot. It is possible that the human ACAT expressed in yeast lost most of its activity due to mis-folding or aberrant secondary modification of the protein. Another explanation of the low level in vivo activity of hACAT expressed in yeast relates to the utilization of the preferred ACAT reaction substrate. In yeast, the predominant sterol is ergosterol which differs from cholesterol by the presence of unsaturation at the C-7 position and at C-22, with an extra methyl group at C-24. It has been shown that ergosterol is not a good substrate for rat liver microsomal ACAT (18Tavani D. Nes W. Billheimer J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 774-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test if the human ACAT protein expressed in yeast is functional and that the observed activity represents low affinity of the human enzyme for ergosterol, we utilized an in vitro assay system to measure ACAT activity (Table II). The addition of exogenous cholesterol to the microsomal assay greatly increased esterification by the hACAT expressing strain approximately 6-fold. This suggests that one reason for the low activity observed in vivo is the lack of appropriate substrate for the mammalian enzyme. The in vitro ACAT activity of microsomes from yeast expressing the hACAT was sensitive to both competitive (Sandoz 58035) and non-competitive (DuP 128) inhibitors. Interestingly, the endogenous yeast enzymes were only affected by the competitive inhibitor (S58035, Table II), even though DuP 128 was present at 50 times its IC50 for mammalian ACAT. This suggests that the binding site for DuP 128 is not conserved between yeast and humans. To test if the individual yeast ARE enzymes differ in their sensitivity to S58035, we prepared and assayed microsomes from single are1â and are2â mutants (strains SCY060 and SCY061). Using a range of concentrations of the inhibitor, we estimated the IC50 of Are1p and Are2p to be 31 and 34 Î¼M, respectively, whereas the IC50 of a preparation from wild type cells was 20 Î¼M. The IC50 of rat ACAT in the same experiment was estimated as 40 Î¼M.Table II.In vitro microsomal esterification; human ACATEsterificationaÂ± S.D. from triplicates.% Pharmacological inhibitionEndogenousbEsterification in the presence of endogenous sterol.+ CholesterolcEsterification in the presence of 100 Î¼g/ml cholesterol.Dup128dConcentration of 0.5 Î¼M.S58035eConcentration of 50 Î¼M.pmol/min/mgWild-type317 Â± 8.48762 Â± 52.33071%are1âare2â24.5 Â± 4.9535 Â± 25.46are1âare2â + hACAT60.5 Â± 27.58355.5 Â± 98.2994%92%Rat liver microsomes371 Â± 62.41334.5 Â± 88.3998%96%a Â± S.D. from triplicates.b Esterification in the presence of endogenous sterol.c Esterification in the presence of 100 Î¼g/ml cholesterol.d Concentration of 0.5 Î¼M.e Concentration of 50 Î¼M. Open table in a new tab Having demonstrated the activity of the human ACAT cDNA in yeast, we extended these observations to assess the affinity of the human and yeast enzymes for different sterol or acyl-CoA substrates (Table III., Table IV.). Despite the fact that the dominant sterol in yeast is ergosterol, the yeast ARE enzymes also readily esterified cholesterol. In contrast, human macrophage ACAT expressed in the double are mutant yeast showed a substrate selectivity similar to the mammalian enzyme as opposed to yeast, with little activity against ergosterol (Table III). Both yeast and rat enzymes esterified 7-dehydrocholesterol, while no apparent activity utilizing this substrate was observed with hACAT expressed in yeast.Table III.In vitro sterol substrate specificity: human macrophage ACAT versus yeast AREpSterol additionbEsterification in the presence of 100 Î¼g of sterol.EsterificationaÂ± S.D. from triplicates.No sterolcEsterification in the presence TR1339 only.+ Cholesterol+ Ergos+7-Dehydropmol/min/mgWild-type66 Â± 331081 Â± 33386 Â± 58353 Â± 112are1âare2â + hACAT98 Â± 67305 Â± 2235 Â± 3564 Â± 2Rat liver microsomes149 Â± 201155 Â± 107128 Â± 27539 Â± 44a Â± S.D. from triplicates.b Esterification in the presence of 100 Î¼g of sterol.c Esterification in the presence TR1339 only.

Open table in a new tab To assess the acyl-CoA substrate specificity, the assay conditions were identical to those for sterol specificity except that activity was followed by the esterification of radiolabeled cholesterol in the presence of various unlabeled acyl-CoAs. Human ACAT expressed in yeast utilized various acyl-CoAs as substrates with palmitoyl, oleoyl, linoleoyl, and arachidonyl CoAs showing similar activity and stearoyl-CoA somewhat less. In contrast, yeast esterification was specific for C18 unsaturated fatty acids. Rat liver enzymes showed a broader specificity than either of the yeast enzymes, but in no case was activity against arachidonyl-CoA observed (Table IV). Our previous demonstration of the in vivo requirement of the yeast ARE genes in sterol esterification provokes two hypotheses with regard to their role in this reaction. These proteins are homologous to a mammalian protein shown to be required for sterol esterification, in vitro (30Cheng D. Chang C.C.Y. Qu X. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, it was hypothetically possible that the ARE gene products mediate substrate transport to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, conventionally the site of esterification. A more parsimonious explanation would be that ARE1 and ARE2 encode isoforms of the catalytic components of"

In the present study, using purified recombinant CD38, we showed that the cADPR hydrolase activity of CD38 was inhibited by ATP in a competitive manner with cADPR. To identify the binding site for ATP and/or cADPR, we labeled the purified CD38 with FSBA. Sequence analysis of the lysylendopeptidase-digested fragment of the labeled CD38 indicated that the FSBA-labeled residue was Lys-129. We introduced site-directed mutations to change the Lys-129 of CD38 to Ala and to Arg. Neither mutant was labeled with FSBA nor catalyzed the hydrolysis of cADPR to ADPR. Furthermore, the mutants did not bind cADPR, whereas they still used NAD+ as a substrate to form cADPR and ADPR. These results indicate that Lys-129 of CD38 participates in cADPR binding and that ATP competes with cADPR for the binding site, resulting in the inhibition of the cADPR hydrolase activity of CD38.

The latter approach was used to identify Tyr-274 as the active site of the vaccinia enzyme, i.e. through systematic replacement of tyrosines by phenylalanines (8Shuman S. Kane E.M. Morham S.G. Proc.

Additional residues that we and others have identified as essential or important for covalent catalysis by the vaccinia topoisomerase are conserved in the cellular counterparts (3Morham S.G.

Indeed, the effects of mutations at the corresponding positions in cellular type I topoisomerases are generally concordant with the findings for the vaccinia enzyme (12Jensen A.D. Svejstrup J.Q. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Levin N.A. Bjornsti M. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1993; 133: 799-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tanizawa A. Bertrand R.

This suggests a common structural basis for DNA strand cleavage by the vaccinia and cellular topoisomerases. A distinctive feature of the vaccinia topoisomerase is its specificity for cleaving duplex DNA at pentapyrimidine recognition site 5â²-(C/T)CCTTâ (16Shuman S. Prescott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1796-1803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11372-11379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using simple model substrates containing a single CCCTT cleavage site, Stivers et al. (19Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have determined the rate constants for the cleavage and religation reactions at 20Â°C and defined the rate-limiting steps under single-turnover and steady-state conditions. Analysis of the pH dependence of the rate constant for cleavage (kcl) and the internal equilibrium constant (Kcl) indicated the presence of two titratable groups on the enzyme (20Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15449-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A reaction mechanism was proposed involving general-base catalysis of the attack by Tyr-274 on the scissile phosphodiester and general-acid catalysis of the expulsion of the 5â²-deoxyribose oxygen (20Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15449-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The pKa values point toward unperturbed histidine and cysteine side chains as candidates for the roles of proton acceptor and donor, respectively. In the present study, we test the importance of histidines and cysteines in topoisomerase reaction chemistry by replacing each of the eight histidines and two cysteines of the vaccinia topoisomerase with alanine. All Ala-substitution mutations except one had no discernible effect on topoisomerase activity in vitro Alanine substitution for His-265 slowed the overall rate of DNA relaxation by reducing the rates of the strand cleavage and the strand religation steps. Mutations were introduced into the vaccinia virus topoisomerase gene by using the two-stage polymerase chain reaction-based overlap extension method (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). Plasmid pA9topo (22Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the template for the first-stage polymerase chain reaction. Gene fragments with overlapping ends obtained from the first-stage reactions were paired and used as template in the second-stage amplification. Products containing the entire topoisomerase gene were cloned into the T7-based expression vector pET11b (Novagen) as described (6Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29978-29983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Petersen B.Ã. Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. pET11-based plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. Topoisomerase expression was induced by infection with bacteriophage Î»CE6 as described (22Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the cultures were adjusted to 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-D-galactopyranoside immediately before inoculation with phage. Wild-type and mutant topoisomerases were purified from soluble bacterial lysates by phosphocellulose column chromatography (22Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the phosphocellulose preparations were determined by using the dye-binding method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Reaction mixtures (20 Î¼l) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 M NaCl, 0.3 Î¼g of pUC19 plasmid DNA, either 2.5 mM EDTA or 5 mM MgCl2, and wild-type or mutant topoisomerases (12, 4, 1.3, 0.44, 0.15, 0.05, or 0.016 ng of the phosphocellulose enzyme preparations) were incubated at 37Â°C for 15 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of a solution containing SDS (0.3% final concentration), glycerol, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 1.2% horizontal agarose gel in TBE buffer (90 mM Tris borate and 2.5 mM EDTA). The gels were stained in 0.5 Î¼g/ml ethidium bromide solution, destained in water, and photographed under short-wave UV illumination. An 18-mer CCCTT-containing DNA oligonucleotide was 5â² end-labeled by enzymatic phosphorylation in the presence of [Î³-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then gel-purified and hybridized to a complementary 30-mer strand (present at 4-fold molar excess). Reaction mixtures (20 Î¼l) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of 18-mer/30-mer DNA, and topoisomerase were incubated at 37Â°C. Covalent complexes were denatured by adding SDS to 1%. The denatured samples were electrophoresed though a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Free DNA migrated near the bromphenol blue dye front. Covalent complex formation was revealed by transfer of radiolabeled DNA to the topoisomerase polypeptide. The extent of covalent adduct formation (expressed as the percentage of the input 5â²32P-labeled oligonucleotide that was covalently transferred to protein) was quantitated by scanning the dried gel using a FUJIX BAS1000 Bio-Imaging analyzer. Single-turnover cleavage assays were performed at 22Â°C with 50 mM of each of the following reaction buffers: sodium acetate, pH 4.6; sodium 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 5.6 and 6.5; Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 8.5; and sodium 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid, pH 9.5. The wild-type and H265A topoisomerases were preincubated in a 50 mM solution of reaction buffer for 5 min. The cleavage reactions were initiated by mixing the enzyme solution with an equal volume of 50 mM reaction buffer containing the DNA substrate. (Final concentrations were 50 mM buffer, 1.9 Î¼g/ml topoisomerase, and 15 nM DNA.) To determine the rate of cleavage by the H265A mutant, aliquots (20 Î¼l) were withdrawn at 15 and 30 s; 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min; and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h. (An additional 24-h time point was taken for rate determination at pH 4.6). The samples were quenched immediately by adding SDS. The protein-DNA adducts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitated by scanning the gels with a Bio-Imaging analyzer. A plot of the percentage of input DNA cleaved versus time-established end-point values for cleavage. The data were normalized to the end-point values, and kobs was determined by fitting the data to the equation (100 â%Clnorm) = 100eâkt. Aliquots were taken from wild-type topoisomerase cleavage reaction mixtures at 10, 20, and 30 s and 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 60 min. To better determine the initial rates of wild-type cleavage, additional sets of reaction mixtures were quenched at a single time point (5 s). The 5-s reactions were performed in triplicate at each pH; the average 5-s value was used to calculate the cleavage rate constant. Control experiments were performed to test whether the H265A protein was inactivated during a 24-h incubation at 22Â°C at pH 4.6, 5.6, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, or 9.5. After this incubation, the protein was adjusted to pH 7.5 and assayed for suicide cleavage during a 5-min incubation at pH 7.5. We found that the H265A protein suffered no loss of activity during these incubations. A 60-mer oligonucleotide containing a centrally placed CCCTT element was 5â² end-labeled and then gel-purified and annealed to an unlabeled complementary 60-mer strand. Reaction mixtures (20 Î¼l) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of 60-mer DNA duplex, and topoisomerase were incubated for 10 min at 37Â°C. Covalent complexes were trapped by the addition of SDS to 1%. The denatured samples were digested for 60 min at 45Â°C with 10 Î¼g of proteinase K. The volume was adjusted to 50 Î¼l, and the digests were then extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform. DNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation. The pelleted material was resuspended in formamide, and the samples were electrophoresed through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea in TBE. The cleavage product, a 32P-labeled 30-mer bound to a short peptide, was well resolved from the input 60-mer substrate (18Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11372-11379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of strand cleavage was quantitated by scanning the wet gel using a Bio-Imaging analyzer. Single alanine substitutions were introduced at each of the eight histidines and two cysteines of the 314-amino acid vaccinia topoisomerase. A double mutant in which both cysteines were replaced by alanine was also included in the analysis. The wild-type and mutated proteins were expressed in E. coli using a T7 RNA polymerase-based expression system (22Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were purified from bacterial extracts by phosphocellulose column chromatography. The polypeptide compositions of the enzyme preparations were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). In every case, the 33-kDa topoisomerase polypeptide constituted the major species, and the extents of purification were essentially equivalent. To assess the impact of these mutations, all proteins were tested for their ability to relax supercoiled plasmid DNA in vitro Screening assays were performed in the absence of magnesium. (The rate-limiting step under these conditions is the dissociation of topoisomerase from the relaxed plasmid product.) Activity was quantitated by end-point dilution, beginning with 12 ng of the phosphocellulose topoisomerase preparation and decreasing by serial 3-fold decrements to 16 pg. We observed that the specific activity of every mutant protein except one (H265A) was equivalent to that of the wild-type topoisomerase (data not shown). The DNA relaxation assays were also performed in the presence of 5 mM magnesium. Magnesium stimulates the activity of the wild-type enzyme â¼9-fold under conditions of DNA excess by enhancing the product off-rate without affecting the rate of DNA cleavage (19Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 23Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29760-29764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activities of all the mutant proteins (except H265A) were enhanced â¼9-fold by 5 mM magnesium and were again equivalent to that of the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). Hence, we conclude that Cys-100 and Cys-211 are dispensable for topoisomerase activity and that seven of the histidines (His-33, His-39, His-76, His-152, His-172, His-177, and His-307) are nonessential. The experiments that follow focus on the catalytic contributions of His-265. The effects of the H265A mutation were reflected in the kinetics of DNA relaxation (Fig. 2). 4 ng (110 fmol) of wild-type topoisomerase relaxed 0.3 Î¼g of supercoiled pUC19 DNA (â¼180 fmol) to completion within 1 min. In reactions containing 4 ng of the H265A protein, relaxed DNA accumulated slowly and steadily over 30 min, and relaxation was complete only after 60 min (Fig. 2). Hence, the H265A mutation reduced the rate of DNA relaxation to about one-sixtieth of that of the wild-type enzyme. Magnesium stimulated the rate of relaxation by wild-type topoisomerase such that the plasmid was relaxed to completion within 15 s (Fig. 2). In contrast, magnesium had no effect on the kinetics of relaxation by H265A (Fig. 2). DNA relaxation by H265A in the presence of magnesium was at least 2 orders of magnitude slower than that by the wild-type topoisomerase. There are two ways in which the H265A mutation can slow DNA relaxation: (i) by slowing the rate-limiting step, or (ii) by retarding another component step to the point that it becomes rate-limiting. The failure of H265A to be stimulated by magnesium suggested that the product off-rate was not rate-limiting for the mutant protein as it is for wild-type topoisomerase. This suggested that H265A directly affected reaction chemistry. A suicide substrate containing a single CCCTTâ cleavage site was used to examine DNA cleavage under single-turnover conditions (24Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate consisted of an 18-mer scissile strand annealed to a 30-mer complementary strand to produce an 18-bp 1The abbreviation used is: bpbase pair(s). duplex with a 12-mer 5â² tail (Fig. 3). Upon formation of the covalent protein-DNA adduct, the distal cleavage product 5â²-ATTCCC is released, and the topoisomerase becomes covalently trapped on the DNA (as illustrated in Fig. 3). The extent of cleavage by the wild-type topoisomerase during a 5-min reaction was proportional to added enzyme; 95% of the input DNA became covalently bound at saturation (Fig. 3A). The concentration dependence of the H265A activity profile was similar to that of the wild type, but only 35-38% of the input substrate was covalently bound in 5 min (Fig. 3A). base pair(s). Suicide cleavage by the wild-type topoisomerase was nearly complete within 10 s at 37Â°C (Fig. 3B). In contrast, H265A cleaved the DNA quite slowly. Covalent adduct accumulated steadily over 20 min; 84% of the input substrate was cleaved after 1 h (Fig. 3B). The H265A data fit well to a single exponential with an apparent cleavage rate constant (kobs) of 0.002 sâ1. The extent of cleavage by wild-type enzyme at 5 s was 76% of the end-point value (Â±4%; average of five experiments). We used this datum to estimate a wild-type rate constant of 0.28 sâ1. Thus, we observed that the H265A mutation slowed the rate of cleavage by 2 orders of magnitude. Note that kcl for wild-type topoisomerase at 37Â°C was higher than the value of 0.07 sâ1 determined at 20Â°C with a different DNA substrate (19Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized previously that a histidine might function as a general base during transesterification (20Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15449-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). According to this model, the imidazole ring nitrogen would accept a proton from the hydroxyl of the active site tyrosine (Tyr-274), thereby facilitating nucleophilic attack by the phenolic oxygen on the scissile phosphate. If His-265 plays such a role, we would expect the H265A mutant to display an altered pH-rate profile in single-turnover cleavage. We therefore measured the rate of suicide cleavage by H265A as a function of pH in the range of pH 4.6-9.5. A plot of log kobs versus pH is shown in Fig. 4. The shape of the H265A pH-rate profile was similar to that of wild-type topoisomerase. This argued that His-265 is not the general base in topoisomerase-mediated strand cleavage. His-265 was replaced with glutamine and asparagine, which are nearly isosteric with histidine (30Plapp B.V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) but cannot be protonated like histidine. The H265N and H265Q proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified by phosphocellulose chromatography. The polypeptide compositions of these enzyme preparations were similar to that of the wild type depicted in Fig. 1 (data not shown). The rates of relaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA by H265N and H265Q in the absence of a divalent cation were about one-half to one-fourth of the wild-type rate (Fig. 5). Relaxation by H265N and H265Q was stimulated 2-fold by 5 mM magnesium (Fig. 5). Suicide cleavage by H265N and H265Q in a 5-min reaction was proportional to added enzyme; 93% of the input DNA was covalently bound at saturation (Fig. 6A). Cleavage by H265N and H265Q was slowed compared to that by wild-type topoisomerase (Fig. 6B). Apparent cleavage rate constants of 0.08 and 0.06 sâ1 for H265N and H265Q were estimated from the extents of cleavage at 10 s (Fig. 6B). The mild effects of the H265N and H265Q mutations on the rate of single-turnover DNA cleavage contrasted with the severe rate decrement observed for the H265A mutant. Religation of the cleaved strand occurs by attack of a 5â²-OH-terminated polynucleotide on the 3â² phosphodiester bond between Tyr-274 and the DNA. This transesterification step can be studied independent of strand cleavage by assaying the ability of a preformed topoisomerase-DNA complex to religate the covalently held 5â²32P-labeled strand to a heterologous acceptor strand (24Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16755-16758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type, H265N, H265Q, and H265A proteins were incubated with the suicide cleavage substrate for 60 min to attain near-equivalent levels of the covalent intermediate. We then added a 100-fold molar excess of an 18-mer acceptor strand complementary to the 5â² tail of the covalent donor complex (Fig. 7) while simultaneously increasing the ionic strength to 0.3 M NaCl. (Addition of NaCl during the religation phase promotes dissociation of the topoisomerase after strand closure and prevents recleavage of the strand transfer product.) Religation to the 18-mer yielded the 32P-labeled 30-mer depicted in Fig. 7. The strand transfer product was resolved from the input 32P-labeled 18-mer strand by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The wild-type enzyme transferred 96% of the input CCCTT-containing strand to the exogenous acceptor (Fig. 7). The extent of religation at the earliest time point analyzed (10 s) was 95% of the end-point value. Similarly, H265N and H265Q transferred >90% of the input DNA to the acceptor, with â¼80% of the end-point value attained in 10 s. Thus, the Asn and Gln substitutions caused a relatively mild slowing of the strand transfer reaction. In contrast, strand transfer by H265A was much slower. The religated 30-mer accumulated steadily over 10 min; 74% of the input substrate was religated after 20 min. The observed religation rate constant (krel) was 0.004 sâ1. Thus, the H265A mutation slowed the rate of religation by at least 2 orders of magnitude relative to the wild-type religation rate. We used a 60-bp DNA duplex containing a centrally placed cleavage site with 30 bp upstream and 30 bp downstream of the scissile bond to study topoisomerase cleavage under true equilibrium conditions. Cleavage of the 60-mer duplex by the wild-type topoisomerase was linear up to 20 ng of protein and plateaued at 38-152 ng (Fig. 8). At saturation, 17% of the substrate was cleaved. The cleavage equilibrium constant (Kcl = covalent complex/noncovalent complex) was 0.2, which was slightly higher than the Kcl of 0.13 determined at 20Â°C (19Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Covalent complex formation by H265N, H265Q, and H265A increased with enzyme up to 40 ng and saturated thereafter. Remarkably, 48-51% of the input 60-mer was cleaved by the three His-265 mutants at saturation; hence Kcl was about 5-fold higher than that of the wild-type topoisomerase. We conclude that the H265 mutations skew the cleavage-religation equilibrium in favor of the covalently bound state. These findings were confirmed by a kinetic analysis of cleavage of the 60-mer duplex by the H265N, H265Q, and H265A proteins (Fig. 9A). H265N and H265Q achieved end points of 51% cleavage (Kcl = 1.0) and 48% cleavage (Kcl = 0.92), respectively. Equilibrium cleavage by H265N and H265Q was virtually complete within 10-20 s. The H265A mutant displayed a slow approach to equilibrium over 5 min (Fig. 9A). 48% of the input 60-mer was covalently bound at equilibrium (Kcl = 0.92). The rate constant kobs for approach to equilibrium by H265A was 0.01 sâ1. Knowing that Kcl = 0.96 and that kobs = kcl+ krel, we calculated that kcl = 0.005 sâ1 and krel = 0.005 sâ1. The rate constant for cleavage by H265A of the 60-mer DNA (0.005 sâ1) was fairly close to the observed rate constant for single-turnover cleavage of the 18-mer/30-mer suicide substrate (0.002 sâ1). We measured single-turnover religation on the 60-mer substrate by allowing the cleavage reaction to reach equilibrium and then adjusting the reaction mixtures to 0.3 M NaCl. This concentration of salt blocks both equilibrium cleavage and single-turnover cleavage by interfering with DNA binding (Refs. 16Shuman S. Prescott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 24Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; data not shown). Topoisomerase prebound to an equilibrium cleavage substrate at low ionic strength is dissociated when the salt concentration is raised to >0.25 M (16Shuman S. Prescott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, topoisomerase molecules that have catalyzed strand closure on the 60-mer DNA will be dissociated from the DNA by salt and will be unable to rebind and recleave. The decrease in covalent complex as a function of time after the addition of NaCl is plotted in Fig. 9B The extent of cleavage by H265N and H265Q plummeted rapidly from 48-50% to 2%. The closure reaction was virtually complete at the earliest time point (10 s). In contrast, the level of H265A covalent complex declined slowly over 10 min (krel = 0.004 sâ1). Note that the observed rate constant for H265A in single-turnover religation agreed with the value calculated from the rate of approach to equilibrium. In continuing our mutational analysis of the vaccinia DNA topoisomerase, we focused on cysteine and histidine side chains as potential catalysts during transesterification. Alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that neither of the two cysteines in the protein was important for enzyme activity. Of the eight histidines, only His-265 was essential for catalysis. An essential amino acid side chain was defined operationally as one whose removal, e.g. by alanine replacement, results in drastic (100-fold) loss of function. The H265A mutation profoundly slowed the rates of single-turnover cleavage and single-turnover religation. We estimate that the rates of both chemical steps were reduced by about 2 orders of magnitude compared to the wild-type protein. These effects on reaction chemistry are probably sufficient to explain the effect of the H265A mutation on the rate of DNA relaxation. A noteworthy effect of the H265A mutation was to bias the cleavage-religation equilibrium toward covalent binding. Kcl of H265A (0.92) was nearly 5-fold higher than that of the wild-type topoisomerase (0.2) on the 60-bp CCCTT-containing DNA. Because Kcl = kcl/krel, the H265A mutation must have slowed the rate of religation of the 60-bp DNA to a greater extent (relative to the wild-type rate) than it slowed the rate of cleavage. The apparent rate constants for single-turnover cleavage on a suicide substrate and single-turnover religation on the suicide cleavage intermediate were 0.002 sâ1 and 0.004 sâ1, respectively. The equilibrium constant of 0.5 calculated from the ratio of the single-turnover rate constants agreed reasonably well with the value of 0.92 for equilibrium cleavage of the 60-mer. His-265, which is essential for topoisomerase activity, is strictly conserved in every known eukaryotic type I topoisomerase (Fig. 10). None of the other seven histidine residues of the vaccinia topoisomerase is strictly conserved (2Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 271-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the alignment of Caron and Wang (2Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 271-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), His-265 is situated within a 9-amino acid motif that includes 3 other conserved residues: Lys-257 (which is Lys or Arg in all family members); Ala-260 (an invariant residue); and Val-262 (an aliphatic residue in most cases) (Fig. 10). Within this segment, the vaccinia topoisomerase is most closely related to the topoisomerases encoded by its poxvirus cousins Shope fibroma virus and orf virus (26Klemperer N. Lyttle D.J. Tauzin D. Traktman P. Robinson A.J. Virology. 1995; 206: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and to the type I topoisomerases of Ustilago maydis (27Gerhold D. Thiyagarjan M. Kmiec E.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3773-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis thaliana (2Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 271-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and Plasmodium falciparum (28Tosh K. Kilbey B. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 10). We predict that the conserved histidine plays an essential role in the chemistry of strand cleavage and religation by cellular type I topoisomerases. What is the role of His-265 during covalent catalysis? It apparently does not function as a general base during single-turnover cleavage because the shape of the pH-rate profile of H265A was similar to that of wild-type topoisomerase and because replacements by Asn and Gln were well tolerated. His-265 may thus engage in hydrogen-bonding interactions that are critical for topoisomerase activity; this hydrogen bonding potential is largely retained after substitution by Gln or Asn. Still, the H265N and H265Q proteins are slightly slowed with respect to their cleavage rates, and their equilibrium cleavage constants are higher than that of wild-type protein. The increase in Kcl was similar to that seen with H265A. The implication is that even subtle alterations at position 265 affect strand religation more than strand cleavage. His-265 is situated only 9 amino acids away from the active site Tyr in the linear sequence of the vaccinia topoisomerase. We speculate that His-265 is part of the active site in the native folded protein. The interval between the homologous histidines of the cellular topoisomerases and their respective active site tyrosines is interrupted by a linker region of variable length, e.g. 90 amino acids in the human topoisomerase and 167 amino acids in the yeast enzyme (2Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 271-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The linker has no counterpart in the poxvirus topoisomerases, is not well conserved even among the cellular topoisomerases, and is apparently dispensable for topoisomerase activity (29Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We suspect therefore that the His-265 and Tyr-274 equivalents of the cellular enzymes are likely to be disposed in three dimensions as they are in the vaccinia topoisomerase. Definitive assessment of predictions regarding the action of His-265 and its location at the active site await the determination of the crystal structure of topoisomerase bound covalently to DNA. In conclusion, our results establish the importance of conserved residue His-265 but exclude all histidines and cysteines as essential acid-base catalysts in DNA cleavage. Aspartate and glutamate side chains emerge as the next likely candidates for the role of general base. We have already shown that 5 of the 35 acidic residues in vaccinia topoisomerase are nonessential (6Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29978-29983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Petersen B.Ã. Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).

Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). Immature glycan chains on nascent polypeptides have the structure Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 (Glc = glucose; Man = mannose; GlcNAc = N-acetyl glucosamine) and are initially processed by the sequential action of two ER enzymes, glucosidase I and glucosidase II (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Within the last few years, it has become apparent that processing of Glc residues, or Glc trimming, is an important step in the association of many glycoproteins with the molecular chaperone calnexin (3Hochstenbach F.

Calnexin and calreticulin are transmembrane and lumenal ER proteins, respectively, that are two known members of a family of endogenous lectin-like proteins that recognize partially trimmed, monoglucosylated (Glc1Man9GlcNAc2) glycan chains on newly synthesized glycoproteins (8Peterson J.R.

Monoglucosylated Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 glycan chains may be generated via two mechanisms: cotranslational processing of immature Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 glycans by glucosidase I and glucosidase II enzymes (the Glc trimming pathway), or reglucosylation of fully trimmed Man8-9GlcNAc2 glycans by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein-dependent glucosyltransferase enzymes (the reglucosylation or salvage pathway) (4Hammond C.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3098-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that glucosyltransferase effectively reglucosylates denatured but not native glycoproteins in vitro (18Fernandez F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 20Parker C.G. Fessler L.I. Nelson L.E. Fessler J.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that reglucosylation plays an important role in the ER quality control system. Indeed, it has been proposed that glucosyltransferase functions as a major sensor for incompletely folded proteins in the ER and that glucosylation of nascent proteins stops upon adoption of the correct conformation (16Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 17Ganan S. Cazzulo J.J. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3098-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).Studies using cell-free assays have determined that the size of the glycan chain, e.g. the Man core, is a critical factor in their modification by glucosyltransferase enzymes; glycopeptides containing Man8-9GlcNAc2 glycans are reglucosylated much more efficiently than those having Man7GlcNAc2 glycans, which are poorly recognized by glucosyltransferase (16Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In contrast, although Man core size is important for interaction of oligosaccharide chains with calnexin (which associates preferentially with Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 glycans), it is not crucial, as calnexin also binds smaller Glc1Man5-7GlcNAc2 species with significant efficiency (12Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Spiro and colleagues (10Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Soling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) recently reported similar findings regarding calreticulin association with glycans. Like calnexin and calreticulin chaperones, glucosyltransferase is believed to interact with both glycan and protein domains on incompletely folded proteins; this interaction, interestingly, involves recognition of hydrophobic stretches on the polypeptide backbone and the innermost GlcNAc residue on the oligosaccharide chain (19Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Hebert et al. (15Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) recently provided evidence that viral hemagglutinin glycoproteins synthesized in cell-free systems are processed by glucosidase I and II and glucosyltransferase enzymes and interact with calnexin. However, because no inhibitors of glucosyltransferase currently exist, the relative importance of the reglucosylation pathway for calnexin assembly remains to be determined. Indeed, it has never been demonstrated that reglucosylated proteins associate with lectin-like chaperones in intact cells of any type (21Fernandez F.S. Jannatipour M. Hellman U. Roheach L.A. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Glc trimming and calnexin association are initial molecular events in the translation of T cell antigen receptor (TCR) proteins, occurring coincident with or immediately after their translocation into the ER and preceding their assembly into multisubunit protein complexes (14Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 22van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9660-9665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Clonotypic TCRÎ± and TCRÎ² polypeptides are members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily and share several structural features, including conserved cysteine residues and post-translational modification by a similar number of N-linked glycan chains (6Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Kearse K.P. Singer A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 167: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, oligosaccharide processing and calnexin association is critical for stabilizing nascent TCRÎ± proteins within the ER, but is not required for the stability of analogous TCRÎ² proteins (6Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This apparent paradox may relate to the suggestion that, unlike the TCRÎ² transmembrane domain, the transmembrane region of TCRÎ± does not function efficiently as a stop transfer region within the lipid bilayer of the ER and may rely on calnexin association for membrane stabilization (6Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Shin J. Lee S. Strominger J.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1901-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).To further our understanding of the role of glycan processing and chaperone association in the quality control system of the ER, we studied the reglucosylation of TCRÎ±/Î² proteins and their assembly with calnexin in BW thymoma cells. These data demonstrate that TCRÎ±/Î² proteins undergo cycles of deglucosylation and reglucosylation in the ER and show that numerous reglucosylated proteins assemble with calnexin in intact cells, including TCRÎ±/Î² proteins. Finally, the results in the current study indicate that reglucosylation is critical for calnexin assembly with TCRÎ± proteins but not TCRÎ² proteins.DISCUSSIONIn the current report we examined the deglucosylation and reglucosylation of TCRÎ±/Î² proteins and their assembly with calnexin in BW thymoma cells. The results in this study show that reglucosylated TCRÎ±/Î² proteins and other unidentified reglucosylated proteins associate with calnexin in vivo, providing the first evidence that reglucosylated proteins interact with calnexin chaperones in intact cells of any type (15Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 21Fernandez F.S. Jannatipour M. Hellman U. Roheach L.A. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that significantly fewer reglucosylated proteins were associated with calreticulin compared to calnexin, which might reflect transient interactions of nascent glycoproteins with calreticulin relative to calnexin (8Peterson J.R. Ori A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, we find that association of TCRÎ±/Î² proteins with calreticulin is significantly transitory relative to their assembly with calnexin (35Van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25345-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, we have also considered the possibility that calreticulin may preferentially associate with glycoproteins bearing monoglucosylated glycans generated via the Glc trimming pathway, which raises the interesting suggestion that proteins containing monoglucosylated species created by reglucosylation may not be conformationally identical to those derived via initial deglucosylation of nascent glycans.The data in the current study are of important significance regarding the role of glucosidase enzymes in removal of Glc residues from reglucosylated proteins, as it has been proposed that endomannosidase enzymes localized within the intermediate compartment between the trans ER and the cis Golgi might also perform this function, providing a distal, more stringent level of quality control (10Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Soling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 39Daniel P.F. Winchester B. Warren C.D. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our finding that removal of Glc residues from reglucosylated TCRÎ±/Î² proteins was effectively blocked by castanospermine, an inhibitor of glucosidase I and glucosidase II enzymes (34Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), but not endomannosidase activity (40Moore S.E.H. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8443-8451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Rabouille C. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11573-11578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicates that glucosidase II is responsible for deglucosylation of the vast majority of reglucosylated TCRÎ±/Î² proteins in BW thymoma cells.In agreement with current models of protein folding and quality control, our data indicate that TCRÎ±/Î² proteins undergo multiple cycles of Glc removal and addition. Interestingly, we found that comparable amounts of TCRÎ² proteins were reglucosylated in consecutive labeling experiments, suggesting that no significant improvement in the folding status of TCRÎ² proteins had occurred during a 30-min lag period. Regarding this issue, it is noteworthy to mention that similar amounts of reglucosylated TCRÎ² proteins were associated with calnexin in consecutive labeling experiments in BW cells (data not shown), raising the consideration as to whether calnexin assembly with reglucosylated TCRÎ² glycoproteins actually promotes their folding into the correct conformation, or if calnexin functions solely to retain incompletely folded glycoproteins in the ER.Truncated Glc3Man5GlcNAc2 glycan chains are generated via the alternative pathway of glycoprotein biosynthesis, which is utilized by many cell types following glucose starvation or ATP depletion (42Chapman A.E. Calhoun J.C. Arch. Biochem Biophys. 1988; 260: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 43Rearick J.I. Chapman A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6255-6261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glucosylated Man5GlcNAc2 glycans are effectively transferred to proteins in the ER and can be processed to complex-type oligosaccharides in the Golgi (26Kornfeld S. Gregory W. Chapman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11649-11654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Trowbridge I.S. Hyman R. Mazauskas C. Cell. 1978; 14: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The current study shows that numerous molecules interact with calnexin in cell types synthesizing proteins with truncated glycans, providing evidence that quality control mechanisms that regulate egress of properly folded proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex are sustained under conditions where truncated glycan chains are added to newly synthesized proteins. These data are in agreement with recent findings by Spiro and co-workers, demonstrating that smaller size Glc1Man5GlcNAc glycans effectively interact with calreticulin in cell-free assays (10Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Soling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The present study shows that reglucosylation of TCRÎ±/Î² glycoproteins is markedly decreased in BW cell types synthesizing truncated Man5-7 core glycans compared to BW cells making typical Man9 core glycans. While decreased reglucosylation of TCRÎ± proteins is confounded by the differential stability of TCRÎ± proteins under these conditions, decreased reglucosylation of TCRÎ² chains in BW cells making truncated glycans must result from differences in the recognition of TCRÎ² proteins by glucosyltransferase enzymes in these cell types, as the stability of TCRÎ² proteins is unaffected by glycan chain length. Indeed, our findings are in clear agreement with previously published results, showing that glycopeptides containing truncated glycans are extremely poor substrates for glucosyltransferase in vitro (16Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).Our findings that reglucosylated TCRÎ² proteins were assembled with calnexin even though reglucosylation was not necessary for formation of calnexin-TCRÎ² protein complexes suggest that two populations of TCRÎ² proteins exist within the ER of BW cells: TCRÎ² proteins that effectively assemble with calnexin immediately after Glc trimming and those that require multiple rounds of deglucosylation and reglucosylation for chaperone interaction. Interaction of TCRÎ² proteins with calnexin was not significantly decreased under conditions of impaired reglucosylation, however, indicating that most TCRÎ² proteins associate with calnexin following initial removal of Glc residues from nascent glycan chains. We would also note that our data are consistent with the idea that TCRÎ² proteins are reglucosylated while assembled into calnexin-TCRÎ² protein complexes. We think this is possible because oligosaccharides are not required to maintain calnexin-protein interactions and are readily accessible to macromolecular probes such as lectins and glycosidases (12Ware F.E.

Experiments designed to explore these issues are currently in progress.Finally, the current study demonstrates that survival of newly synthesized TCRÎ± proteins in the ER is severely limited under conditions where reglucosylation is severely impaired. These findings importantly extend previous results that TCRÎ± proteins containing full-length glycans are rapidly degraded under conditions were Glc residues persist on glycan chains and calnexin association is impaired (6Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), by showing that TCRÎ± proteins are specifically degraded under conditions where numerous cellular proteins, including TCRÎ² proteins, effectively assemble with calnexin. Impaired calnexin assembly with TCR proteins containing truncated glycans might also be explained by the failure of glucosidase enzymes to remove Glc residues from nascent oligosaccharides, as glucosidase I and II enzymes have been shown to deglucosylate Glc1-3Man5-7GlcNAc2 glycans less efficiently than Glc1-3Man9GlcNAc2 glycans in vitro (47Grinna L.S. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2255-2258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, as noted in the current report, Glc trimming of TCRÎ±/Î² proteins to monoglucosylated species was not significantly impaired in BW cell types synthesizing truncated glycans. Whether or not removal of the final, innermost Glc residue occurs more slowly on TCRÎ±/Î² proteins containing truncated glycans than those having standard size glycans is unknown; however, we would point that this would favor the opportunity for calnexin binding, not decrease it (12Ware F.E.

The ineffectiveness of the TCRÎ± transmembrane domain to function as a stop transfer region (24Shin J. Lee S. Strominger J.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1901-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) may relate to the reason why TCRÎ± proteins containing truncated glycan chains do not effectively associate with calnexin as TCRÎ± proteins might require numerous rounds of deglucosylation and reglucosylation to stably assemble with calnexin in the lipid bilayer of the ER. Alternatively, reglucosylation of an unknown accessory protein may be necessary for stable interaction of TCRÎ± proteins with calnexin molecules. These issues are currently under investigation. It will also be interesting to determine if reglucosylation is critical for calnexin assembly with other proteins that utilize lectin-dependent folding pathways in the ER, such as major histocompatibility complex class I proteins and cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator molecules.

Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). Immature glycan chains on nascent polypeptides have the structure Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 (Glc = glucose; Man = mannose; GlcNAc = N-acetyl glucosamine) and are initially processed by the sequential action of two ER enzymes, glucosidase I and glucosidase II (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Within the last few years, it has become apparent that processing of Glc residues, or Glc trimming, is an important step in the association of many glycoproteins with the molecular chaperone calnexin (3Hochstenbach F.

Calnexin and calreticulin are transmembrane and lumenal ER proteins, respectively, that are two known members of a family of endogenous lectin-like proteins that recognize partially trimmed, monoglucosylated (Glc1Man9GlcNAc2) glycan chains on newly synthesized glycoproteins (8Peterson J.R.

Monoglucosylated Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 glycan chains may be generated via two mechanisms: cotranslational processing of immature Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 glycans by glucosidase I and glucosidase II enzymes (the Glc trimming pathway), or reglucosylation of fully trimmed Man8-9GlcNAc2 glycans by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein-dependent glucosyltransferase enzymes (the reglucosylation or salvage pathway) (4Hammond C.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3098-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that glucosyltransferase effectively reglucosylates denatured but not native glycoproteins in vitro (18Fernandez F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 20Parker C.G. Fessler L.I. Nelson L.E. Fessler J.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that reglucosylation plays an important role in the ER quality control system. Indeed, it has been proposed that glucosyltransferase functions as a major sensor for incompletely folded proteins in the ER and that glucosylation of nascent proteins stops upon adoption of the correct conformation (16Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 17Ganan S. Cazzulo J.J. Parodi A.J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).Studies using cell-free assays have determined that the size of the glycan chain, e.g. the Man core, is a critical factor in their modification by glucosyltransferase enzymes; glycopeptides containing Man8-9GlcNAc2 glycans are reglucosylated much more efficiently than those having Man7GlcNAc2 glycans, which are poorly recognized by glucosyltransferase (16Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In contrast, although Man core size is important for interaction of oligosaccharide chains with calnexin (which associates preferentially with Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 glycans), it is not crucial, as calnexin also binds smaller Glc1Man5-7GlcNAc2 species with significant efficiency (12Ware F.E.

Spiro and colleagues (10Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Soling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) recently reported similar findings regarding calreticulin association with glycans. Like calnexin and calreticulin chaperones, glucosyltransferase is believed to interact with both glycan and protein domains on incompletely folded proteins; this interaction, interestingly, involves recognition of hydrophobic stretches on the polypeptide backbone and the innermost GlcNAc residue on the oligosaccharide chain (19Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Hebert et al. (15Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) recently provided evidence that viral hemagglutinin glycoproteins synthesized in cell-free systems are processed by glucosidase I and II and glucosyltransferase enzymes and interact with calnexin. However, because no inhibitors of glucosyltransferase currently exist, the relative importance of the reglucosylation pathway for calnexin assembly remains to be determined. Indeed, it has never been demonstrated that reglucosylated proteins associate with lectin-like chaperones in intact cells of any type (21Fernandez F.S. Jannatipour M. Hellman U. Roheach L.A. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Glc trimming and calnexin association are initial molecular events in the translation of T cell antigen receptor (TCR) proteins, occurring coincident with or immediately after their translocation into the ER and preceding their assembly into multisubunit protein complexes (14Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 22van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9660-9665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Clonotypic TCRÎ± and TCRÎ² polypeptides are members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily and share several structural features, including conserved cysteine residues and post-translational modification by a similar number of N-linked glycan chains (6Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Kearse K.P. Singer A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 167: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, oligosaccharide processing and calnexin association is critical for stabilizing nascent TCRÎ± proteins within the ER, but is not required for the stability of analogous TCRÎ² proteins (6Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This apparent paradox may relate to the suggestion that, unlike the TCRÎ² transmembrane domain, the transmembrane region of TCRÎ± does not function efficiently as a stop transfer region within the lipid bilayer of the ER and may rely on calnexin association for membrane stabilization (6Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Shin J. Lee S. Strominger J.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1901-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).To further our understanding of the role of glycan processing and chaperone association in the quality control system of the ER, we studied the reglucosylation of TCRÎ±/Î² proteins and their assembly with calnexin in BW thymoma cells. These data demonstrate that TCRÎ±/Î² proteins undergo cycles of deglucosylation and reglucosylation in the ER and show that numerous reglucosylated proteins assemble with calnexin in intact cells, including TCRÎ±/Î² proteins. Finally, the results in the current study indicate that reglucosylation is critical for calnexin assembly with TCRÎ± proteins but not TCRÎ² proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1990047934,"The chemoattractant cAMP, acting through serpentine cAMP receptors, results in a rapid and transient stimulation of the Dictyostelium mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2 activity (1). In this study we show that other pathways required for aggregation, including Ras and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), are important regulators of ERK2 activation and adaptation. By examining both the level and kinetics of activation and adaptation of ERK2, we show that Ras is a negative regulator of ERK2. Activated Ras or disruption of a Ras GAP gene results in reduced ERK2 activation whereas disruption of putative Ras GEF or expression of dominant negative Ras proteins have a more rapid, higher, and extended activation. CRAC, a PH domain-containing protein required for adenylyl cyclase activation, is also required for proper ERK2 adaptation. PKA overexpression results in a more rapid, higher level of activation, whereas pka null cells show a lower level but more extended ERK2 activation. Furthermore, we show that constitutive expression of PKA catalytic subunit bypasses the requirement of ERK2 for aggregation and later development, indicating that PKA lies downstream from ERK2 and that ERK2 may regulate one or more components of the signaling pathway required for mediating PKA function, possibly by directly regulating PKA R or a protein controlling the intracellular level of cAMP."

Unlike most seven-TM receptors, it is comprised of a long extracellular N-terminal exodomain and a membrane-associated C-terminal endodomain containing 7 TM helices (1McFarland K. Sprengel R.

Low affinity hormone binding and initial receptor activation are likely to involve the exoloops and TM helices of the endodomain. The structure of these domains probably is affected by the organization of TM helices.A unique feature of TM helices is the presence of Pro (11Probst W. Snyder L. Schuster D. Brosius J. Sealfon S. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), in contrast to the general lack of Pro in helices of globular proteins (12von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Pro disrupts helices (13Chou P. Fasman G. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) and introduces a â¼26Â° kink (14Barlow D. Thornton J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 601-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) in the helix backbone (15Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). The kink in TM helices is thought to orient so that the Pro-containing convex side is adjacent to neighboring TM helices, whereas the concave side faces the lipid phase (12von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). As a result, TM Pros are thought to influence the packing and organization of TM helices and thus, the mechanism of receptor activation (16Ji T. Murdoch W. Ji I. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite their potential significance, the five TM Pros of the LH/CG receptor have not been examined together. Herein, we report the importance of two of the Pros in hormone binding and targeting of the receptor to the surface membrane.RESULTSThere are five Pros in the seven TM helices of the LH/CG receptor, Pro463 and Pro479 in TM 4, Pro562 in TM 6, and Pro591 and Pro598 in TM 7 (Fig. 1). These TM Pros were individually substituted with Phe to produce LH/CG-RP463F, LH/CG-RP479F, LH/CG-RP562F, LH/CG-RP591F, and LH/CG-RP598F. The mutant receptor plasmids were transfected into 293 cells. Stably transfected cells were assayed for 125I-hCG binding and hCG induced cAMP synthesis. Counts of empty tubes (background) were â¼50 CPM and nonspecific binding was â¼100 CPM including background. Maximum specific binding counts/min are included in parentheses in the table section of the figure. Intact cells expressing LH/CG-RP463F, LH/CG-RP562F or LH/CG-RP591F bound hCG with Kd values 44-100% higher than the Kd value of the wild type receptor (Fig. 2A). They were also capable of inducing cAMP synthesis with EC50 values 37-89% higher than that of the wild type receptor (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the high EC50 values are due to the corresponding high Kd values. Also these hCG binding and hCG-dependent cAMP induction are specific for the receptor since nontransfected cells and mock transfected cells did not bind 125I-hCG nor induced hCG-dependent cAMP production. In contrast to the functional mutants, LH/CG-RP479F and LH/CG-RP598F did not bind hCG or induce cAMP production at the normal hCG concentrations. However, at >Î¼M hCG concentrations, LH/CG-RP479F showed some hCG binding but not cAMP induction (data not shown). This result does not clearly distinguish whether the apparent low affinity hormone binding of LH/CG-RP479F is due to a reduction in binding affinity or to low surface expression.Fig. 2Biological activities of Pro â Phe substitution mutants. Five TM Pros were individually substituted with Phe and the mutant receptors were stably expressed in human 293 cells. The cells were assayed for hormone binding and hCG dependent cAMP induction. Counts of empty tubes (background) were â¼50 cpm, and nonspecific binding was â¼100 cpm, including background. Maximum specific binding counts/min are included in parentheses in the table. Each experiment was performed in duplicate, and values were determined for Kd, receptors/cell, EC50 for cAMP synthesis, and maximal cAMP level. Experiments were repeated four to six times, and means and S.D. were presented in the table. The statistical significance of the data was analyzed by Student' t test. The resulting p values are presented as a for p < 0.001, b for p < 0.01, c for p < 0.02, and d for p < 0.05. NS, not significant; ND, not detectable. In addition, values for different mutants were compared with the corresponding values of the wild type receptor using analysis of variance with 95% confidence. A mutant with p < 0.05 was considered to be a significantly different from the wild type as discussed in the text. Nontransfected cells did not show specific binding of hCG. As a control to verify intended mutations and identify unintended changes, if any, in the cDNA sequence, mutant receptor cDNAs were reverted to wild type, and their sequences were confirmed. The revertant cDNAs were used to transfect cells and assayed for hormone binding and cAMP induction. All revertants behaved the same as the wild type (data not included).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Solubilized ReceptorsSince these two mutant receptors might be synthesized and trapped within cells, 125I-hCG binding studies were performed with cells solubilized in Nonidet P-40. hCG binding to solubilized LH/CG-RP479F was barely detectable. In contrast, solubilized LH/CG-RP598F bound hCG (Fig. 2B) with affinity similar that of solubilized wild type receptor, LH/CG-RP463F, LH/CG-RP562F and LH/CG-RP591F. However, the Kd values of solubilized receptors are â¼2-fold higher than those of the corresponding receptors on intact cells. This small loss in apparent binding affinities of solubilized receptors is often observed for wild type and mutant receptors (22Ryu K.-S. Gilchrist R.L. Ji I. Kim S.-J. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7301-7304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It may reflect either the low sensitivity of the assay or slight denaturation of receptors during the solubilization and/or assay steps. In any event, our data indicate that LH/CG-RP598F is synthesized and capable of hCG binding. Furthermore, the result suggests that the mutant receptor might be trapped inside of the cells. Alternatively, LH/CG-RP598F may be expressed on the cell surface but is incapable of binding hCG in situ, perhaps due to defective folding. In this case, solubilization in the nonionic detergent may facilitate proper folding and promote hormone binding. In contrast, LH/CG-RP479F is either not synthesized or synthesized but incapable of binding hormone.Antibody BindingTo further analyze expression and localization of the Pro479â Phe and Pro598â Phe mutants, two independent immunological methods were utilized. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding receptors carrying the flag epitope, flag wild type LH/CG receptor, flag-LH/CG-RP479F, and flag-LH/CG-RP598F. For immunofluorescent labeling studies, cells were either examined intact or after treatment with Triton X-100 to permeabilize the plasma membrane and to allow the antibody to enter the cytosol. Confocal laser fluorescence microscopy shows bright fluorescence of the flag wild type receptor on intact cells and in permeabilized cells (Fig. 3). Cells expressing the wild type receptor lacking the flag tag did not showed fluorescence, regardless of permeabilization. In addition, the cells expressing flag wild type receptor did not show fluorescence when treated for fluorescence labeling without anti-flag antibody. These controls demonstrate that the flag wild type receptor is expressed on the cell surface and within cells. Flag-LH/CG-RP479F was also observed on intact and permeabilized cells, indicating it is expressed on the cell surface and within cells. On the other hand, flag-LH/CG-RP598F was observed in permeabilized cells only, indicating that flag-LH/CG-RP598F was not transported to the cell surface.Fig. 3Localization of flag-LH/CG receptors using anti-flag antibody. Cells stably transfected with plasmids encoding the wild type LH/CG receptor, the flag wild type receptor, flag-LH/CG-RP479F or flag-LH/CG-RP598F were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and sequentially labeled with mouse anti-flag antibody and Texas Red conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG. Specimens were scanned through multiple sections of cells using confocal laser fluorescence microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The other approach used to test expression of the receptors was radioimmune ligand binding using radioiodinated monoclonal anti-flag antibody. 125I-anti-flag antibody bound to the cells expressing the flag wild type receptor or flag-LH/CG-RP479F but not to the cells expressing flag-LH/CG-RP598F (Fig. 4). The Kd values were 29 nM and 147 nM for the flag wild type receptor and flag-LH/CG-RP479F, respectively. The number of binding sites on the cell surface are significant, 27,000 and 138,000/cell, excluding the possibility that the binding observed resulted from nonspecific binding. Taken together, these and the fluorescence microscopy indicate that 125I-anti-flag was capable of specifically detecting the flag epitope in the receptors. More importantly, the results demonstrate that the Flag-wild type receptor and flag-LH/CG-RP479F were expressed on the cell surface, whereas flag-LH/CG-RP598F was not.Fig. 4Binding of 125I-anti-flag antibody. Intact cells stably transfected with plasmids of the flag wild type LH/CG receptor, flag-LH/CG-RP479F, or flag-LH/CG-RP598F were incubated with 125I-labeled anti-flag antibody in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled anti-flag antibody as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Results were analyzed by Scatchard plots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activities of Flag ReceptorsTo test whether the flag epitope might interfere with processing and activities of the flag-LH/CG receptors, hCG binding and cAMP induction were examined. The flag wild type receptor and the wild type receptor on intact cells and in solution bound hCG with similar affinities (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, the flag wild type receptor was capable of hCG-dependent cAMP induction, although the EC50 value for cAMP induction was â¼3-fold higher than the value of the wild type receptor (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, the Kd values of solubilized LH/CG-RP598F and flag-LH/CG-RP598F were similar (Figs. 2B and 5B). These data show that the flag-LH/CG receptors are active, although their potency is somewhat different from LH/CG receptors lacking the flag epitope. With this in mind, we examined flag-LH/CG-RP479F. While hCG did not bind to flag-LH/CG-RP479F on intact cells, hCG bound to the receptor in detergent solution with low affinity (Fig. 5B). This is not entirely surprising since hCG binding to LH/CG-RP479F in solution was barely detectable.Fig. 5Activities of flag receptors. Hormone binding and cAMP induction receptors were determined as described in the legened to Fig. 2 and under âExperimental Procedures.â Fl, flag epitope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The loss of binding on intact cells and the extremely low affinity binding in solution of flag-LH/CG-RP479F could be due to the introduction of the bulky phenyl side chain or the loss of the Pro induced kink at this position in TM helix 4. To distinguish these possibilities, Pro479 was substituted with Gly and Ala to produce Flag-LH/CG-RP479G and Flag-LH/CG-RP479A, respectively. Both mutants failed to bind hCG on intact cells and induce hCG dependent cAMP synthesis (Fig. 6, A and B). On the other hand, they were capable of binding hCG in detergent solution (Fig. 6, C and D). Kd values were â¼2-fold higher than that of the flag wild type receptor. In addition, receptor concentrations were greater than that of the flag wild type receptor. Again, it appeared possible that both mutants may not be expressed on the cell surface or may be expressed on the surface but defective in hCG binding. In the latter case, they may have undergone changes in the structure when solubilized in the detergent solution. To resolve these possibilities, cells transfected with plasmids carrying the mutant cDNAs were treated with anti-flag antibodies and examined under confocal microscopy. The results in Fig. 7 demonstrate that flag-LH/CG-RP479G and Flag-LH/CG-RP479A are present both on the surface of intact cells and within permeabilized cells.Fig. 6Multiple substitutions for Pro479.

In addition, surface expression of nonbinding receptors were characterized with flag-LH/CG receptors using immunofluorescence microscopy and antibody binding.The Pro479â Phe and Pro598â Phe substitutions caused dramatic, yet contrasting effects (Table I). The Pro598â Phe substitution prevented surface expression without affecting hormone binding. In contrast, the Pro479â Phe substitution allowed surface expression but impaired hCG binding to the receptor on the cell surface as did Pro479â Gly and Pro479â Ala substitutions. Surprisingly, solubilization in Nonidet P-40 rescued the ability of the mutants to bind the hormone. This novel observation demonstrates a striking difference in hormone binding on intact cells and in nonionic detergent solution. A simple explanation is that, during solubilization, the mutant receptors undergo structural changes leading to a structure that more closely resembles the native receptor. Alternatively, the structure of the mutant receptors may be subtly yet critically different depending on whether they are embedded in the lipid bilayer or associated with the nonionic detergent in solution. It is also possible that hormone binding of the mutants might be interfered with due to other membrane molecules which were present in the membrane but removed by detergent solubilization.Table IEffects of substitutions for TM ProProTMSurface expressionCell bindingSolution bindingcAMP inductionWild type++++Pro463â Phe4++++Pro479â Gly4+â+âPro479â Ala4+â+âPro479â Phe4+â+âPro562â Phe6++++Pro591â Phe7++++Pro598â Phe7ââ+â Open table in a new tab Although substitutions of Gly, Ala, and Phe for Pro479 impacted hormone binding to solubilized receptors, the extents were significantly different. The Kd value of flag-LH/CG-RP479F is significantly higher than those of flag-LH/CG-RP479G and flag-LH/CG-RP479A. One wonders whether the bulky phenyl side chain of Phe479 interferes the interaction of TM 4 with a neighboring TM, hormone binding, and/or structural restoration during solubilization. A similar result was observed when Pro556 of the thyrotropin receptor, which is equivalent to Pro479 of the LH/CG receptor, was replaced with Leu in the hypothyroid hyt/hyt mouse (23Stein S.A. Oates E.L. Hall C.R. Grumbles R.M. Fernandez L.M. Taylor N.A. Puett D. Jin S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 24Gu W.-X. Du G.-G. Kopp P. Rentoumis A. Albanese C. Kohn L. Madison L. Jameson J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3146-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The thyrotropin receptor mutant was expressed on the cell surface but was incapable of binding hormone. Therefore, the substitution of bulky amino acids for the TM 4 Pro appears to be intolerable for hormone binding at the cell surface. Also, the Pro479-induced kink does not appear to play a significant role on hormone binding, since the Pro479â Gly and Pro479â Ala substitutions had the same effect, although the helix is expected to bend by Gly but not by Ala. Taken together, these results indicate that the side chain of Pro479 is more important than the Pro479-induced kink for hormone binding, particularly at the cell surface. On the other hand, Pro479 is not required for surface expression of the receptor.The substitution of Phe for Pro463 of TM 4, Pro562 of TM 6, and Pro591 of TM 7 slightly increased the Kd values for hCG binding on intact cells and in detergent solution as well as the EC50 values for cAMP induction. However, the substitutions did not significantly impact the maximal cAMP level. The results indicate that these three TM Pros play marginal roles on hormone binding and cAMP induction, and have no effect on surface expression.The marginal effect of the Pro463â Phe substitution is not surprising. Pro463 in TM 4 is variant among the LH/CG receptors of different species and is generally absent in other glycoprotein hormone receptors and seven TM receptors. On the other hand, Pro479 of TM 4 and Pro598 of TM 7 are conserved throughout seven TM receptors. Likewise, Pro562 of TM 6 and Pro591 of TM 7 are conserved among the glycoprotein hormone receptors and are partially conserved among other seven TM receptors. Pro463 may be nonessential because it is located at the third amino acid position from the N terminus of the TM 4 helix. Although internal Pros are helix destabilizers, a Pro within the first three positions does not destabilize an Î± helix (12von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), because amide nitrogens of the first four residues in an Î± helix do not form hydrogen bonds.Pro562 is located in the middle of TM 6 and Pro591 in the N-terminal one-third of TM 7. Consequently, the loss of either Pro induced kink may affect exoloop 3. Since these Pro â Phe substitutions only slightly reduced the high affinity for hormone binding, exoloop 3 may not play a crucial role in high affinity hormone binding. These findings are consistent with the observation that exoloop 3 of the LH/CG receptor is essential for receptor activation but is only marginally important for high affinity hormone binding 2S. Hong, M.-S. Oh, K.-S. Ryu, I. Ji, and T. H. Ji, unpublished observation. (22Ryu K.-S. Gilchrist R.L. Ji I. Kim S.-J. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7301-7304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Also the results are in accord with studies showing that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the exoloop 3 sequence of the LH/CG receptor inhibits 125I-hCG binding to the LH/CG receptor only slightly (25Roche P.C. Ryan R.J. McCormick D.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Finally, the data in this study also demonstrate the utility of flag epitopes for the localization, transport, and quantification of glycoprotein hormone receptors. Introduced epitopes do not significantly impact the biological activity of the receptor, which in turn provides a sound methodology for studying their surface expression and activation.

Unlike most seven-TM receptors, it is comprised of a long extracellular N-terminal exodomain and a membrane-associated C-terminal endodomain containing 7 TM helices (1McFarland K. Sprengel R.

Low affinity hormone binding and initial receptor activation are likely to involve the exoloops and TM helices of the endodomain. The structure of these domains probably is affected by the organization of TM helices.A unique feature of TM helices is the presence of Pro (11Probst W. Snyder L. Schuster D. Brosius J. Sealfon S. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), in contrast to the general lack of Pro in helices of globular proteins (12von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Pro disrupts helices (13Chou P. Fasman G. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) and introduces a â¼26Â° kink (14Barlow D. Thornton J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 601-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) in the helix backbone (15Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). The kink in TM helices is thought to orient so that the Pro-containing convex side is adjacent to neighboring TM helices, whereas the concave side faces the lipid phase (12von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). As a result, TM Pros are thought to influence the packing and organization of TM helices and thus, the mechanism of receptor activation (16Ji T. Murdoch W. Ji I. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite their potential significance, the five TM Pros of the LH/CG receptor have not been examined together. Herein, we report the importance of two of the Pros in hormone binding and targeting of the receptor to the surface membrane."

INTRODUCTIONNitrogenase-catalyzed substrate reduction involves a complex series of reactions including the association of the two nitrogenase metalloproteins, MgATP hydrolysis coupled to interprotein electron transfer, followed by the dissociation of the two metalloproteins (1Kim J.

The generally accepted mechanism for nitrogenase-catalyzed reduction reactions is that two MgATP molecules bind to the Fe protein, priming this protein for docking to the MoFe protein. After complex formation, a single electron is transferred from the Fe protein [4Fe-4S] cluster to a MoFe protein FeMoco, with a P-cluster as a probable intermediate. Two molecules of MgATP bound to the Fe protein are hydrolyzed to two MgADP molecules and two Pi molecules in a reaction that appears to be coupled to electron transfer (7Lowe D.J. Fisher K. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Peters J.W. Fisher K. Dean D.R. Annu. Rev.

Following electron transfer, the oxidized Fe protein, with two bound MgADP molecules, dissociates from the one-electron reduced MoFe protein in what is considered to be the reaction rate-limiting step (10Hageman R.V. Burris R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Thorneley R.N.F. Lowe D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The oxidized Fe protein is reduced by low potential electron transfer proteins (e.g. flavodoxin or ferredoxin), and the two MgADP molecules are replaced with two MgATP molecules, preparing the Fe protein for a second round of docking to the MoFe protein and electron transfer. This cycle is repeated until sufficient electrons have accumulated to reduce the substrate bound to FeMoco (12Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1984; 217: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).MgATP appears to serve at least three important functions in the proposed reaction mechanism, namely (i) MgATP binding induces protein conformational changes in the Fe protein necessary for docking to the MoFe protein (14Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); (ii) MgATP hydrolysis is coupled to intercomponent electron transfer; and (iii) MgATP hydrolysis is coupled to the dissociation of the Fe protein from the MoFe protein (15Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

MgATP binding to the Fe protein is known to result in changes in the properties of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, suggesting long range communication through protein conformational changes.

At least one signal transduction pathway from the nucleotide binding site to the [4Fe-4S] cluster has recently been identified as the protein chain from Asp-125 to Cys-132, designated as switch II (14Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It appears that MgATP binding induces changes in the position of this switch, resulting in changes in the protein environment around the [4Fe-4S] cluster. This has been suggested to ready the Fe protein for interaction with the MoFe protein (14Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Upon hydrolysis of MgATP to MgADP and Pi, the Fe protein is proposed to undergo additional protein conformational changes (2Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This is deduced from the observation that the MgADP-bound state of the Fe protein exhibits distinct spectroscopic properties for the [4Fe-4S] cluster compared with the MgATP-bound state (18Ryle M.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3290-3294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that the conformational changes induced within the Fe protein in going from the MgATP-bound state to the MgADP-bound state represent a molecular switch, which could be coupled to electron transfer and dissociation of the protein-protein complex (2Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The status of the nucleotide bound to the protein would have to be communicated to the [4Fe-4S] cluster and the MoFe docking interface approximately 19 Ã away. Switch II participates in this communication event, both in changes to the cluster and in defining the affinity for association with the MoFe protein (15Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Related to these issues is the important observation that the MoFe protein docking to the Fe protein stimulates the hydrolysis of MgATP bound to the Fe protein, suggesting some communication from the docking interface to the nucleotide binding site, probably by relocating residues critical for hydrolysis.Recently, Asp-129 on the switch II pathway has been suggested to be a possible general base that could activate a water for hydrolysis of MgATP (24Lanzilotta W.N. Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10713-10723Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An examination of the x-ray structure of the Fe protein from Azotobacter vinelandii (4Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) reveals that Asp-39 is also located near Asp-129, suggesting a possible role for this residue in the hydrolysis of MgATP (Fig. 1). In addition, Asp-39 is part of a protein chain that connects the nucleotide binding site to the MoFe protein docking surface of the Fe protein. This protein chain is a second possible communication pathway in the Fe protein (25Renner K.A. Howard J.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5353-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and has features in common with switch I in other nucleotide switch proteins (26Sablin E.P. Kull F.J. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Residues at the end of the proposed switch I in the Fe protein have been previously identified as functioning in docking interactions with the MoFe protein (27Peters J.W. Fisher K. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28076-28083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It seemed possible that Asp-39 could be essential for two important functions of the nitrogenase Fe protein, (i) Asp-39 could be a general base, activating a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the Î³-phosphate of MgATP, and (ii) Asp-39 could function in switch I nucleotide signal transduction to the MoFe protein docking interface. To probe these possible functions of Asp-39, we have changed this residue to the amino acids asparagine (D39N) and glutamic acid (D39E) and characterized the properties of the purified, altered Fe proteins. The D39N altered Fe protein was still active in MgATP hydrolytic activity when combined with the MoFe protein, ruling out an essential role for Asp-39 as a general base in the MgATP hydrolysis mechanism. The D39N Fe protein was able to transfer a single electron to the MoFe protein. However, following electron transfer, the D39N Fe protein did not dissociate from the MoFe protein, resulting in a tight protein-protein complex. These results suggest that Asp-39 participates in the signal for component protein dissociation following electron transfer and that electron transfer induces protein conformational changes within the nitrogenase protein-protein complex.DISCUSSIONAs mentioned earlier, an important reaction in the catalytic mechanism of nitrogenase is the dissociation of the Fe protein from the MoFe protein following MgATP hydrolysis and electron transfer. This has been suggested to be the overall reaction rate-limiting step. The results from the present study can be discussed in the context of two important questions relating to the signal for dissociation of the nitrogenase proteins. (i) What is the role of MgATP hydrolysis in signaling protein-protein dissociation, and (ii) what is the role of electron transfer from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein in signaling protein-protein dissociation?MgATP HydrolysisIt is becoming clear that MgATP serves several important functions in the nitrogenase reaction mechanism (2Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 3Mortenson L.E. Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Bolin J.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 67: 299-374PubMed Google Scholar). MgATP binding to the Fe protein clearly induces protein conformational changes that are communicated from the nucleotide binding sites at the center of the protein to the [4Fe-4S] cluster and MoFe protein docking surface approximately 19 Ã away (2Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 14Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These conformational changes dramatically alter both the physicochemical properties of the [4Fe-4S] cluster and the binding equilibrium in favor of the Fe protein-MoFe protein complex (15Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition to influencing the initial binding of the Fe protein to the MoFe protein, it has been held that MgATP hydrolysis is somehow coupled to the transfer of an electron from the Fe protein [4Fe-4S] cluster to the MoFe protein (3Mortenson L.E. Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Bolin J.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 67: 299-374PubMed Google Scholar). This model has been challenged recently by the observation that an altered Fe protein locked in the MgATP-like state (L127Î´) could transfer one electron to the MoFe protein in the absence of MgATP hydrolysis, thus suggesting that only the MgATP-bound protein conformation of the Fe protein was required for electron transfer, not necessarily MgATP hydrolysis (15Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the rate of electron transfer from the L127Î´ Fe protein was significantly slower than that observed from the wild-type Fe protein with MgATP hydrolysis, suggesting that one possible role for MgATP hydrolysis is to accelerate electron transfer. How then is MgATP hydrolysis initiated? Since the Fe protein alone shows no MgATP hydrolysis activity, it can be concluded that MoFe protein docking to the Fe protein initiates MgATP hydrolysis. Several models have been suggested to explain this MoFe protein dependence of MgATP hydrolysis, the most likely being that residues within the Fe protein nucleotide binding site are moved into position to catalyze the hydrolysis reaction (2Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 8Peters J.W. Fisher K. Dean D.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 335-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It would seem reasonable that this would occur by long range protein conformational changes from the MoFe protein docking surface back to the nucleotide binding sites. The results of the present work clearly indicate that Asp-39 cannot be an essential residue (e.g. general base) in the MgATP hydrolysis mechanism as changing the Asp to Asn did not stop MgATP hydrolysis activity. The significantly slower rate of MgATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the D39N Fe protein-MoFe protein complex suggests that Asp-39 could participate either directly or indirectly in positioning residues critical for MgATP hydrolysis.Taken together, these observations suggest that an important function for MgATP hydrolysis in the nitrogenase mechanism might be to induce protein conformational changes that would be coupled to protein-protein dissociation. The results from the present study support the notion (2Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) that the change in protein conformation in the Fe protein in going from the MgATP-bound state to the MgADP-bound state during MgATP hydrolysis could dramatically alter the interactions (and hence affinity) between the Fe protein and the MoFe protein by altering the position of a series of amino acid residues involved in protein-protein interaction. Altering Asp-39 to Asn resulted in an Fe protein that could not access the MgADP-bound protein conformation as detected by changes in the CD and proton NMR spectra of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The resulting tight complex between the D39N Fe protein and the MoFe protein could be the result of the lack of the Fe protein attaining the MgADP-bound protein conformation, even though MgATP is hydrolyzed to MgADP as part of the complex. Together with the observation of a tight complex between the L127Î´ modified Fe protein and the MoFe protein, this suggests that the MgADP-bound state of the Fe protein has a significantly reduced affinity for binding to the MoFe protein, essentially functioning as a trigger for protein-protein dissociation. This idea is supported by the recent observation that if AlF4â was included with nitrogenase under turnover conditions, a tight, protein-protein complex was formed (25Renner K.A. Howard J.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5353-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Duyvis M.G. Wassink H. Haaker H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). AlF4â is thought to be a phosphate analog and to bind to the Fe protein nucleotide site as an ADP-AlF4â complex, preventing the formation of the MgADP-bound state required for complex dissociation. Hence, the Fe protein in the ADP-AlF4â bound conformation cannot achieve the correct conformation for dissociation (25Renner K.A. Howard J.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5353-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Duyvis M.G. Wassink H. Haaker H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A reasonable model would be that one important function of MgATP hydrolysis is as a trigger to alter the Fe protein-MoFe protein equilibrium to favor protein-protein dissociation.Electron TransferWhereas the above model for the function of MgATP hydrolysis in protein-protein dissociation is reasonable, results from the present studies suggest that it is not that simple. Rather, it appears that electron transfer is also somehow coupled to protein-protein dissociation. The results from the present work with the D39N altered Fe protein clearly point to a significant role for electron transfer in defining the affinity for Fe protein binding to the MoFe protein. This comes from the observation that only following electron transfer from the D39N Fe protein to the MoFe protein did a tight, irreversible protein-protein complex form. MgATP hydrolysis to MgADP and Pi continued in both the reduced and oxidized D39N Fe protein-MoFe protein complexes, suggesting that MgATP hydrolysis is not a sufficient signal to initiate protein-protein dissociation. Instead, it would appear that electron transfer is linked to the nucleotide-bound status of the Fe protein to trigger dissociation. This suggests a complex mechanism for protein dissociation in which electron transfer induces protein conformational changes within the Fe protein (and possibly the MoFe protein), which are linked to conformational changes induced by MgATP hydrolysis. There is growing precedent for oxidation or reduction (i.e. electron transfer) of redox active proteins resulting in significant protein conformational changes. For example, flavodoxins (41Romero A. Caldeira J. Legall J. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Romao M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 42Watt W. Tulinsky A. Swenson R.P. Watenpaugh K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), cytochrome c (43Kar L. Sherman S.A. Johnson M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1994; 12: 527-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the [Fe-S] cluster containing adrenodoxin (44Miura S. Ichikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have all been observed to undergo significant protein conformational changes upon oxidation or reduction. In addition, extended x-ray absorption fine structure data for the nitrogenase Fe protein has revealed a 0.02-Ã shortening of the Fe-S bond distance in the [4Fe-4S] cluster upon oxidation from the 1+ to the 2+ state (45Lindahl P.A. Teo B.K. Orme-Johnson W.H. Inorg. Chem. 1987; 26: 3912-3916Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This change in the [4Fe-4S] cluster could easily be translated into changes in the protein environment around the cluster, thus affecting the affinity of the Fe protein for the MoFe protein.So, a reasonable model would suggest that electron transfer from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein results in the oxidation of the Fe protein [4Fe-4S] cluster, inducing protein conformational changes affecting the affinity for MoFe protein docking. This event might also initiate the signal for MgATP hydrolysis, consistent with recent data suggesting that MgATP hydrolysis follows electron transfer (9Lowe D.J. Ashby G.A. Brune M. Knights H. Webb M.R. Thorneley R.N.F. Tikhonovich I.A. Provorov N.A. Romanov V.I. Newton W.E. Nitrogen Fixation: Fundamentals and Applications.Kluwer Academic Publishers Group. 1995; : 103-108Google Scholar). Once in the [4Fe-4S] cluster oxidized state, MgATP hydrolysis then initiates the nucleotide-induced protein conformational changes as the protein goes to the MgADP-bound state, which then favor protein-protein dissociation. Asp-39, being located near the MgATP binding site, may initiate a communication pathway that then proceeds to a region of the Fe protein involved in MoFe protein interactions. This communication pathway may be a second such pathway identified in the Fe protein, going from Asp-39 to Val-67. This putative domain in the Fe protein is highly homologous with similar domains in other nucleotide binding proteins, which have been designated as switch I (26Sablin E.P. Kull F.J. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Thus, as has been suggested for several other nucleotide switch proteins, the nucleotide status of the protein results in different movements in the protein chain switch I, which are communicated over a distance to the binding site for another protein (26Sablin E.P. Kull F.J. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In the Fe protein, it seems reasonable that the MgADP- or MgATP-bound state could be communicated to amino acid residues in the 59 to 67 region critical for docking with the MoFe protein. The 59 to 67 region of the Fe protein has recently been suggested to participate in MoFe protein interactions (27Peters J.W. Fisher K. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28076-28083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, the present work provides evidence that the conserved Asp at position 39 of the nitrogenase Fe protein plays an important role in defining a shift in equilibrium toward Fe protein-MoFe protein dissociation. This could be communicated through a protein domain designated as switch I, which might originate at Asp-39. In addition, evidence was presented suggesting that electron transfer from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein within the complex induces protein conformational changes that are critical in defining the protein-protein binding equilibrium. INTRODUCTIONNitrogenase-catalyzed substrate reduction involves a complex series of reactions including the association of the two nitrogenase metalloproteins, MgATP hydrolysis coupled to interprotein electron transfer, followed by the dissociation of the two metalloproteins (1Kim J. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev.

The two metalloproteins that constitute nitrogenase are the iron (Fe) 1The abbreviations used are: Fe proteiniron protein of nitrogenaseMoFe proteinmolybdenum-iron protein of nitrogenaseFeMoco[1Mo-7Fe-8S-1homocitrate] cofactor of nitrogenaseP-cluster[8Fe-(7-8)S] cluster of nitrogenaseMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidIDSindigo disulfonate. protein, which contains two nucleotide binding sites and a [4Fe-4S] cluster bridging the two identical subunits (4Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and the molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein, an Î±2Î²2 tetramer with two unique [8Fe-(7-8)S] clusters (P-clusters) and two molybdenum-iron-sulfur-homocitrate clusters (FeMoco) (5Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 6Bolin J.T. Ronco A.E. Morgan T.V. Mortenson L.E. Xuong N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The generally accepted mechanism for nitrogenase-catalyzed reduction reactions is that two MgATP molecules bind to the Fe protein, priming this protein for docking to the MoFe protein. After complex formation, a single electron is transferred from the Fe protein [4Fe-4S] cluster to a MoFe protein FeMoco, with a P-cluster as a probable intermediate. Two molecules of MgATP bound to the Fe protein are hydrolyzed to two MgADP molecules and two Pi molecules in a reaction that appears to be coupled to electron transfer (7Lowe D.J. Fisher K. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Peters J.W. Fisher K. Dean D.R. Annu. Rev.

Nitrogen Fixation: Fundamentals and Applications.Kluwer Academic Publishers Group. 1995; : 103-108Google Scholar). Following electron transfer, the oxidized Fe protein, with two bound MgADP molecules, dissociates from the one-electron reduced MoFe protein in what is considered to be the reaction rate-limiting step (10Hageman R.V. Burris R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Thorneley R.N.F. Lowe D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The oxidized Fe protein is reduced by low potential electron transfer proteins (e.g. flavodoxin or ferredoxin), and the two MgADP molecules are replaced with two MgATP molecules, preparing the Fe protein for a second round of docking to the MoFe protein and electron transfer. This cycle is repeated until sufficient electrons have accumulated to reduce the substrate bound to FeMoco (12Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 13Hawkes T.R. McLean P.A. Smith B.E. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).MgATP appears to serve at least three important functions in the proposed reaction mechanism, namely (i) MgATP binding induces protein conformational changes in the Fe protein necessary for docking to the MoFe protein (14Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); (ii) MgATP hydrolysis is coupled to intercomponent electron transfer; and (iii) MgATP hydrolysis is coupled to the dissociation of the Fe protein from the MoFe protein (15Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). One MgATP molecule binds to each subunit of the Fe protein, about 19 Ã away from the bridging [4Fe-4S] cluster and MoFe protein docking interface (4Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). MgATP binding to the Fe protein is known to result in changes in the properties of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, suggesting long range communication through protein conformational changes. Nucleotide-induced changes in the properties of the Fe protein [4Fe-4S] cluster have been monitored as changes in EPR (16Zumft W.G. Cretney W.C. Huang T.C. Mortenson L.E. Palmer G. Biochem. Biophys.

At least one signal transduction pathway from the nucleotide binding site to the [4Fe-4S] cluster has recently been identified as the protein chain from Asp-125 to Cys-132, designated as switch II (14Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It appears that MgATP binding induces changes in the position of this switch, resulting in changes in the protein environment around the [4Fe-4S] cluster. This has been suggested to ready the Fe protein for interaction with the MoFe protein (14Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Upon hydrolysis of MgATP to MgADP and Pi, the Fe protein is proposed to undergo additional protein conformational changes (2Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This is deduced from the observation that the MgADP-bound state of the Fe protein exhibits distinct spectroscopic properties for the [4Fe-4S] cluster compared with the MgATP-bound state (18Ryle M.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3290-3294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that the conformational changes induced within the Fe protein in going from the MgATP-bound state to the MgADP-bound state represent a molecular switch, which could be coupled to electron transfer and dissociation of the protein-protein complex (2Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The status of the nucleotide bound to the protein would have to be communicated to the [4Fe-4S] cluster and the MoFe docking interface approximately 19 Ã away. Switch II participates in this communication event, both in changes to the cluster and in defining the affinity for association with the MoFe protein (15Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Related to these issues is the important observation that the MoFe protein docking to the Fe protein stimulates the hydrolysis of MgATP bound to the Fe protein, suggesting some communication from the docking interface to the nucleotide binding site, probably by relocating residues critical for hydrolysis.Recently, Asp-129 on the switch II pathway has been suggested to be a possible general base that could activate a water for hydrolysis of MgATP (24Lanzilotta W.N. Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10713-10723Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An examination of the x-ray structure of the Fe protein from Azotobacter vinelandii (4Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C.

In addition, Asp-39 is part of a protein chain that connects the nucleotide binding site to the MoFe protein docking surface of the Fe protein. This protein chain is a second possible communication pathway in the Fe protein (25Renner K.A. Howard J.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5353-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and has features in common with switch I in other nucleotide switch proteins (26Sablin E.P. Kull F.J. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Residues at the end of the proposed switch I in the Fe protein have been previously identified as functioning in docking interactions with the MoFe protein (27Peters J.W. Fisher K. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28076-28083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It seemed possible that Asp-39 could be essential for two important functions of the nitrogenase Fe protein, (i) Asp-39 could be a general base, activating a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the Î³-phosphate of MgATP, and (ii) Asp-39 could function in switch I nucleotide signal transduction to the MoFe protein docking interface. To probe these possible functions of Asp-39, we have changed this residue to the amino acids asparagine (D39N) and glutamic acid (D39E) and characterized the properties of the purified, altered Fe proteins. The D39N altered Fe protein was still active in MgATP hydrolytic activity when combined with the MoFe protein, ruling out an essential role for Asp-39 as a general base in the MgATP hydrolysis mechanism. The D39N Fe protein was able to transfer a single electron to the MoFe protein. However, following electron transfer, the D39N Fe protein did not dissociate from the MoFe protein, resulting in a tight protein-protein complex. These results suggest that Asp-39 participates in the signal for component protein dissociation following electron transfer and that electron transfer induces protein conformational changes within the nitrogenase protein-protein complex."

HGF gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level and is restricted to stromal cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages, leukocytes, and endothelial cells in various tissues. Numerous studies have shown that this growth factor is involved in the growth and regeneration of several organs (8Lindroos P. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K.

In response to tissue loss, such as in the case of partial hepatectomy or hepatotoxin injury, the level of HGF mRNA dramatically increases in the liver as well as in other organs such as the lung and spleen (9Matsumoto K.

HGF mRNA also increases in the remaining kidney or lung after unilateral nephrectomy or pneumonectomy, respectively (9Matsumoto K. Hashimoto K. Yoshikawa K. Nakamura T. Exp.

Recent investigations in transgenic mice homozygous for a null mutation in the HGF gene (knock-out mice) have proved that HGF is essential for the development of various tissues such as liver, muscle, and placenta (11Schmidt C.

Kuno J. Noda T. Kitamura N. Nature. 1995; 373: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar).HGF expression is modulated by several cytokines and hormones. For example, it has been shown that in MRC-5 fibroblasts and HL-60 cells HGF expression is down-regulated by transforming growth factor Î²1 and dexamethasone or by coculture with epithelial cells (13Matsumoto K.

To understand the transcriptional regulation of HGF, the sequences of the human, rat, and mouse HGF gene promoters have been determined and the major transcriptional start sites have been mapped (20Miyazawa K.

Several potential regulatory sites including NF-IL6 (also known as C/EBPÎ²) were identified in the 5â²-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter by our laboratory (22Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K.

We reported the identification and partial characterization of a transcriptional repressor in the promoter of the mouse HGF gene (25Liu Y. Beedle A. Lin L. Bell A. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 11: 7046-7058Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We also localized a negative regulatory region in the 5â²-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter residing at position â1 to â0.7 kb (22Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 267: 24917-24920Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that COUP-TF binds to an imperfect estrogen response element (ERE) in this region and represses HGF promoter activity. We show that high expression of the estrogen receptor counteracts the suppressive action of COUP-TF by competing for the same binding site.COUP-TF, which belongs to the orphan nuclear receptor family, was originally found through its interaction with a response element in the chicken ovalbumin gene promoter (26Sagami I.

Nature. 1989; 340: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and has been shown to play both positive and negative roles in gene regulation upon binding to its cognate DNA regulatory element (28Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit: Mechanism of Steroid Hormone Regulation of Gene Transcription. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 111-133Google Scholar). The COUP-TF family (which consists of COUP-TF I and COUP-TF II) binds to the AGGTCA repeat sequence, which also is the DNA half-site for several other nuclear receptors such as the estrogen receptor (ER), vitamin D3 receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptors (RAR and RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) (28Conneely O.M.

In previous studies we reported that estrogen stimulates HGF mRNA expression in mouse ovaries (32Liu Y. Lin L. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our current results implicate COUP-TF as a potent repressor of HGF gene transcription and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate HGF gene expression.DISCUSSIONOur previous studies have shown that a negative regulatory element is located within â964 to â699 of the 5â²-flanking region of the mouse HGF gene (22Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 267: 24917-24920Google Scholar). In this region, an estrogen response element (HERE1) was identified that binds to ER and is responsible for the estradiol stimulation of the mouse HGF promoter in RL95-2 cells co-transfected with an ER expression vector (32Liu Y. Lin L. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We now show that this same element binds with high affinity to the nuclear orphan receptor COUP-TF, which belongs to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, and silences the activity of the HGF promoter. We demonstrate that the estrogen receptor competes with COUP-TF for binding to this site, thereby relieving the repressive action of COUP-TF.There are two imperfect EREs found in the mouse HGF promoter region that we have called HERE1 and HERE2 (22Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 267: 24917-24920Google Scholar, 32Liu Y. Lin L. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HERE1 is localized in the 5â²-flanking region and HERE2 is in the first intron of the HGF gene. By using gel mobility band shift and supershift assays, we demonstrated that HERE1 is similar to the ERE found in the vitellogenin (vit) gene (37Meyer M.E. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel J.T. Tasset D. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 57: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and that it binds not only to ER but also to COUP-TF (Fig. 4) (30 and 32). Co-transfection of ER or COUP-TF expression vectors in NIH3T3 cells revealed that HERE1 confers the repressive function of COUP-TF to the heterologous SV40 promoter and that not only did ER overcome the suppression of COUP-TF but it also stimulated the SV40 promoter (Fig. 6). In the homologous mouse HGF promoter, ER only counteracted the negative effects of COUP-TF (Fig. 5).The molecular mechanisms of COUP-TF-mediated transcriptional repression are partially understood. COUP-TF acts via several different mechanisms to inhibit target gene transcription including competition with other nuclear receptors for the occupancy of DNA binding sites, active repression of basal transcription, active repression of transactivator-dependent transcription, quenching of transactivator-dependent transcription, transrepression of activated transcription, and titration of the common coregulator RXR (31Mangelsdorf D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar, 38Leng X. Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2332-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our data shown here reveal that COUP-TF may down-regulate the mouse HGF promoter by active repression of basal transcription because HERE1 suppresses the basal SV40 promoter and that ER may activate HGF transcriptional activity by replacing COUP-TF and relieving the promoter from repression (Fig. 5). COUP-TF belongs to the orphan (thus far, no ligand has been found that can bind and directly regulate the activity of this factor) nuclear receptor family and resembles the thyroid hormone receptor/steroid hormone receptor superfamily (31Mangelsdorf D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar, 36Pereira F.A. Qiu Y. Tsai M.-J. Tsai S.Y. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The mode by which it represses its target gene involves the binding of COUP-TF to the AGGTCA motif arranged in various configurations (i.e. direct repeats (DR) or inverted repeats (IR) with different numbers of spacers ranging from 0 to 8 nucleotides) (31Mangelsdorf D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the AGGTCA half-site depending on its configuration forms the response elements for other nuclear receptors such as the estrogen receptor (which binds to IR3), thyroid hormone receptor (which binds to IR0 or DR4), retinoid receptors (RAR, which binds to IR0 and DR2, and RXR, which binds to DR5 and DR1), vitamin D receptor (which binds to DR3), HNF4, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (31Mangelsdorf D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). It is believed that COUP-TF directly competes with these receptors for binding to the AGGTCA sequence and thus inhibits their transactivating functions. Suppression by COUP-TF is also achieved in part through heterodimerization of COUP-TF with RXR (which is the essential transactivating partner for vitamin D3 receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and RAR), thereby titrating RXR to a transcriptionally inactive complex (31Mangelsdorf D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar, 38Leng X. Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2332-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that in addition to ER other members of the nuclear receptor family mentioned above may bind to the COUP-TF binding site in the HGF promoter HERE1 and thus activate HGF transcription in a tissue-specific manner. The COUP-TF site in the HGF promoter, however, is composed of an estrogen response element (IR3) and apparently binds only to the estrogen receptor.Previous observations in our laboratory showed that administration of 17Î²-estradiol to immature female mice caused a significant induction of HGF mRNA in the ovaries (32Liu Y. Lin L. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The tissue- and cell type-specific expression of the mouse HGF gene by estrogen may be due to different amounts of hormone receptors in these tissues, as shown by other studies (37Meyer M.E. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel J.T. Tasset D. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 57: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Our present studies show that high expression of estrogen receptor in NIH3T3 cells is sufficient to counteract the suppression of COUP-TF on the mouse HGF promoter (Fig. 5). HGF promoter activity or lack thereof in transgenic mice also supports this hypothesis because estradiol stimulated the HGF promoter in mice carrying the 2.7 HGF-CAT construct that contains HERE1, particularly in tissues that have high expression of ER (Fig. 7). In this regard, it is important to understand how HGF gene expression is relieved from COUP-TF repression in other tissues in which ER may not be operational. The factors that are known to activate HGF expression include cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor Î± and polypeptide growth factors such as epidermal growth factor. These agents do not exert their gene-regulatory function directly through the AGGTCA motif, the DNA binding site for COUP-TF. Although the molecular mechanisms by which these agents induce their target genes are not fully understood, it is well established that they utilize members of the AP1, C/EBP, nuclear factor ÎºB (NFKB), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. Indeed, in our previous report (22Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 267: 24917-24920Google Scholar) we demonstrated that several NF-IL6 (C/EBPÎ²) response elements exist in the 5â²-flanking region of the HGF promoter region and that IL-6 induces HGF promoter activity in a stromal (fibroblast) cell line stably transfected with an HGF-CAT chimeric construct. In our very recent investigations using gel shift, supershift, and CAT assays, we have found that functional C/EBP binding sites exist in the HGF promoter. We also found that co-transfection of expression vectors encoding C/EBPÎ² or C/EBPÎ± with HGF-CAT vectors dramatically (more than 20-fold) stimulates the transcriptional activity of various HGF-CAT promoter constructs (even those constructs that do not contain COUP-TF binding sites, thus indicating that promoter activation is not due to interference with COUP-TF binding). 3J.-G. Jiang and R. Zarnegar, manuscript in preparation. These observations provide an explanation for how the HGF promoter is released from repression exerted by negative acting factors such as COUP-TF. The C/EBP family of transcription factors is known to consist of regulators of important cellular functions ranging from metabolism to cell growth to differentiation.The physiological significance of the transcriptional regulation of the HGF gene by ER and COUP-TF also remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, it has been shown that both HGF and COUP-TF play an important role during embryonic development. COUP-TFs are differentially expressed in a restricted manner during organogenesis (40Qiu Y. Cooney A.J. Kuratani S. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4451-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Both COUP-TF I and COUP-TF II genes are essential since COUP-TF I mutants die prenatally and COUP-TF II mutants die in utero (41Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Additionally, HGF is believed to be one of the major mediators of stromal-epithelial interactions controlling growth and morphogenesis of various tissues such as breast (39Niranjan B. Buluwela L. Yant J. Perusinghe N. Atherton A. Phipard D. Dale T. Gusterson B. Kamalati T. Development. 1995; 121: 2897-2908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the embryological development of such tissues have revealed that steroid hormone-induced ductal morphogenesis and growth is accomplished via the interactions between the stromal and epithelial compartments of these tissues (34Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar). Therefore, the functions of COUP-TF and ER during development may be mediated in part by their ability to regulate HGF gene expression. Our data shown here shed light on the significant interplay among transcription factors such as ER, COUP-TF, and C/EBP and polypeptide growth factors such as HGF.

HGF gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level and is restricted to stromal cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages, leukocytes, and endothelial cells in various tissues. Numerous studies have shown that this growth factor is involved in the growth and regeneration of several organs (8Lindroos P. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K.

In response to tissue loss, such as in the case of partial hepatectomy or hepatotoxin injury, the level of HGF mRNA dramatically increases in the liver as well as in other organs such as the lung and spleen (9Matsumoto K.

HGF mRNA also increases in the remaining kidney or lung after unilateral nephrectomy or pneumonectomy, respectively (9Matsumoto K. Hashimoto K. Yoshikawa K. Nakamura T. Exp.

Recent investigations in transgenic mice homozygous for a null mutation in the HGF gene (knock-out mice) have proved that HGF is essential for the development of various tissues such as liver, muscle, and placenta (11Schmidt C.

For example, it has been shown that in MRC-5 fibroblasts and HL-60 cells HGF expression is down-regulated by transforming growth factor Î²1 and dexamethasone or by coculture with epithelial cells (13Matsumoto K.

To understand the transcriptional regulation of HGF, the sequences of the human, rat, and mouse HGF gene promoters have been determined and the major transcriptional start sites have been mapped (20Miyazawa K.

Several potential regulatory sites including NF-IL6 (also known as C/EBPÎ²) were identified in the 5â²-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter by our laboratory (22Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K.

We reported the identification and partial characterization of a transcriptional repressor in the promoter of the mouse HGF gene (25Liu Y. Beedle A. Lin L. Bell A. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 11: 7046-7058Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We also localized a negative regulatory region in the 5â²-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter residing at position â1 to â0.7 kb (22Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 267: 24917-24920Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that COUP-TF binds to an imperfect estrogen response element (ERE) in this region and represses HGF promoter activity. We show that high expression of the estrogen receptor counteracts the suppressive action of COUP-TF by competing for the same binding site.COUP-TF, which belongs to the orphan nuclear receptor family, was originally found through its interaction with a response element in the chicken ovalbumin gene promoter (26Sagami I.

The COUP-TF family (which consists of COUP-TF I and COUP-TF II) binds to the AGGTCA repeat sequence, which also is the DNA half-site for several other nuclear receptors such as the estrogen receptor (ER), vitamin D3 receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptors (RAR and RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) (28Conneely O.M.

Our current results implicate COUP-TF as a potent repressor of HGF gene transcription and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate HGF gene expression."

Addition of AII to quiescent aortic SMC potently increased the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 as revealed by a decreased electrophoretic mobility and an increased phosphate content of the protein. The stimulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was maximal at 15 min and persisted up to 120 min. Results from affinity chromatography on m7GTP-agarose demonstrated that AII-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 promotes its dissociation from eIF4E in target cells. Further characterization of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping revealed that 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated on eight distinct peptides containing serine and threonine residues in AII-treated cells. The combination of results obtained from kinetics experiments, phosphopeptide analysis of in vitro and in vivo phosphorylated 4E-BP1, and pharmacological studies with the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD 98059 provided strong evidence that the MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2 are not involved in the regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in aortic SMC.

In vascular SMC, the augmented rate of protein synthesis induced by AII is associated with a widespread but selective increase in the content of highly abundant extracellular matrix (6Scott-Burden T.

The increased synthesis of proteins like Î±-actin, collagen, or thrombospondin is accompanied by a corresponding increase in their specific mRNAs, which is indicative of the importance of transcriptional control in the overall stimulation of protein synthesis (6Scott-Burden T.

The major locus of regulation in protein synthesis is generally at the initiation step of mRNA translation (for review, see Refs. 10Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev.

Acta. 1994; 1220: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This step is controlled by the concerted action of a number of initiation factors which are extensively regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms (13Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20823-20826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in translation initiation is the binding of mRNA to the small 40 S ribosomal subunit, which requires the participation of initiation factor eIF4F (15Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1996: 245-269Google Scholar). eIF4F exists as a protein complex composed of three polypeptides: eIF4E (the cap-binding protein), eIF4G, and eIF4A, a RNA helicase. The interaction of eIF4F with the mRNA, followed by the unwinding of the mRNA 5â² secondary structure facilitates the attachment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit which moves along the mRNA scanning for the initiator AUG codon (10Hershey J.W.B.

Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in response to insulin causes its dissociation from eIF4E, thereby relieving translational inhibition (21Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. DonzÃ© O. Lin T.A.

To understand the cellular mechanisms involved in the hypertrophic action of AII, we have examined the regulation of 4E-BP1 function by AII in aortic SMC. We report that AII potently stimulates phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and promotes the dissociation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E. The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 occurs on multiple serine and threonine residues. In addition, we demonstrate that the MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2 are not involved in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in our in vivo model. The source of materials has been described (4Giasson E. Meloche S.

Servant, I. Leduc and J. Pellerin, submitted for publication. Rat1-AT1 cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, antibiotics (50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin and 50 units/ml penicillin), and 0.4 mg/ml geneticin. They were made quiescent by incubating confluent cell cultures in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 containing 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h. Quiescent aortic SMC in 10-cm Petri dishes were stimulated with AII for the indicated times at 37Â°C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA), and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 Ã g for 5 min and the concentration of protein was measured using the Coomassie protein assay kit (Pierce). Normalized amounts of lysate proteins (â¼500 Î¼g) were boiled for 7 min, and then cooled on ice prior to centrifugation at 13,000 Ã g for 5 min at 4Â°C. Heat-soluble proteins were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration of 15%) and incubation on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation for 10 min, the supernatant was removed, and the remaining trichloroacetic acid was extracted with diethyl ether. The final pellet of proteins was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Heat-stable proteins were separated on 15% acrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham) in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine. After fixation for 30 min in 40% methanol, 7% acetic acid, 3% glycerol, the membrane was blocked for 1 h at 37Â°C in TBS containing 3% non-fat dry milk. The membrane was then incubated for 2 h at 25Â°C with antiserum 11208 (1:1000) in blocking buffer. The membrane was washed twice with TBS, twice with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and twice with TBS prior to incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:10,000 in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% milk for 1 h. After washing as above, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). The recombinant GST-4E-BP1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (29MÃ©thot N. Pause A. Hershey J.W.B. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGST-ERK1 was created by subcloning the EcoRI fragment encoding hamster ERK1 from plasmid pCMV/HAPMK (30Meloche S. PagÃ¨s G. PouyssÃ©gur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI site of pGEX-KG (31Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The recombinant GST-ERK1 protein was expressed in E. coli by transformation with plasmid pGST-ERK1 and adsorbed to glutathione-agarose beads. Purified recombinant ERK1 (p44mapk) was obtained by cleavage of the GST-ERK1 fusion protein with thrombin directly on beads (31Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E was evaluated by determining the ability of 4E-BP1 to bind to m7GTP-agarose beads through its interaction with eIF4E. Quiescent aortic SMC in 10-cm Petri dishes were stimulated or not with 100 nM AII for 15 min at 37Â°C. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10â6M leupeptin, 10â6M pepstatin A), and lysed by 3 cycles of freezing and thawing. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay kit (Pierce). The lysate (200 Î¼g of protein) was incubated for 30 min with 25 Î¼l of m7GTP-agarose beads equilibrated in buffer C. After three washes in buffer C, the proteins were eluted directly in Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis on 15% acrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked, and probed sequentially with antiserum 11208 (1:1,000) and with a mouse eIF4E antibody (1:500; Transduction Laboratories) as described above. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Quiescent rat aortic SMC in 100-mm Petri dishes were metabolically labeled for 5 h at 37Â°C in bicarbonate and phosphate-free Hepes-buffered minimum essential medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]phosphoric acid. The cells were stimulated with 100 nM AII and cell lysates were prepared as described previously without heat treatment (4Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The lysates were precleared for 1 h with 5 Î¼l of normal rabbit serum and incubated for 2 h at 4Â°C with 5 Î¼l of antiserum 11208 preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were washed six times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads by heating at 95Â°C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 15% acrylamide gels. Quiescent aortic SMC were stimulated with 100 nM AII for 5 min at 37Â°C. Cell lysates were prepared as described (4Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and incubated for 4 h at 4Â°C with 5 Î¼l of anti-MAP kinase kinase serum preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with kinase assay buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate), and then resuspended in kinase assay buffer containing 200 Î¼M ATP, 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP, and 1 Î¼g of recombinant ERK1. After incubation at 30Â°C for 30 min, purified recombinant GST-4E-BP1 (10 Î¼g) was added and the reaction was continued for an additional 60 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 Ã Laemmli sample buffer and the proteins were resolved by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Control incubations were performed in the absence of ERK1 or GST-4E-BP1. 32P-Labeled 4E-BP1 from immunoprecipitates of metabolically labeled aortic SMC or from in vitro phosphorylation reactions was subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels. For phosphoamino acid analysis, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol and visualized by autoradiography. The labeled bands corresponding to 4E-BP1 were excised and subjected to partial acid hydrolysis in 5.7 M HCl for 1 h at 110Â°C (32Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The resulting phosphoamino acids along with unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards (0.2 mg/ml) were resolved by one-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis using an optimized pH 2.5 buffer (33Jelinek T. Weber M.J. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 629-630Google Scholar). The standards were visualized by ninhydrin staining and the labeled amino acids by autoradiography. For phosphopeptide mapping, the labeled proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, and the 4E-BP1 bands were cut out and directly digested with 40 Î¼g of trypsin for 19 h at 37Â°C in 50 mM NH4HCO3 (34Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An additional aliquot of trypsin was added, and the reaction was incubated for a further 5 h. The reaction mixture was then diluted with water, dried under vacuum, and redissolved in pH 1.9 buffer. The phosphopeptides were separated by thin layer electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer for 45 min at 1,000 V in the first dimension followed by ascending chromatography in phosphochromatography buffer in the second dimension (35Boyle W.J. van des Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). The plates were revealed either by autoradiography or by PhosphorImaging analysis. Quiescent aortic SMC in 60-mm Petri dishes were stimulated with 100 nM AII for 5 min at 37Â°C. The phosphotransferase activity of ERK1 and ERK2 was measured by specific immune complex kinase assays using myelin basic protein as substrate as described previously (4Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Meloche S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To gain understanding in the cellular mechanisms involved in the induction of protein synthesis by AII, we examined the ability of the peptide to regulate the phosphorylation and function of the translational repressor 4E-BP1. Quiescent cultures of rat aortic SMC were stimulated with 100 nM AII for different times, and lysates of the cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antiserum against 4E-BP1. As shown in Fig. 1A, addition of AII resulted in a clear retardation of 4E-BP1 migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, indicative of increased phosphorylation of the protein (22Lin T.A. Kong X.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Three protein bands could be detected in these cells which represent 4E-BP1 phosphorylated to different stoichiometries (24Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 25Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The effect of AII on 4E-BP1 was detectable at 5 min, reached a maximum at 15 min, and remained elevated for at least 120 min. The same results were obtained when we analyzed the phosphorylation state of 4E-BP1 after immunoprecipitation from lysates of 32P-labeled cells stimulated with AII (Fig. 5A). To assess the physiological relevance of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, quiescent aortic SMC were incubated with different concentrations of AII. AII stimulated the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in a dose-dependent manner, with a half-maximal effect observed at approximately 1 nM AII (Fig. 1B). This concentration is comparable to the ED50 value (0.5 nM) of the hormone for the stimulation of protein synthesis in aortic SMC (4Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We also determined which subtype of AII receptors was involved in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Fig. 2 shows that incubation of aortic SMC with the AT1-selective antagonist losartan completely suppressed AII-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, whereas the AT2 antagonist PD 123319 had no effect.Fig. 54E-BP1 is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. A, quiescent rat aortic SMC were labeled with [32P]phosphoric acid for 5 h and then stimulated with 100 nM AII for the indicated times. The cells were lysed, and 4E-BP1 was immunoprecipitated using antiserum 11208 preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing of the beads, the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 15% acrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membrane prior to autoradiography. The position of 4E-BP1 bands is indicated. B, phosphoamino acid analysis of 4E-BP1. The 32P-labeled protein bands corresponding to 4E-BP1 in panel A were excised from the PVDF membrane and subjected to partial acid hydrolysis. The phosphorylated amino acids were separated by one-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis. pS, phosphoserine; pT, phosphothreonine; pY, phosphotyrosine. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2Effect of AII receptor antagonists on AII stimulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Quiescent rat aortic SMC were pretreated for 30 min in the absence or presence of the AT1 selective antagonist losartan (10â5M) or the AT2-selective antagonist PD 123319 (3 Ã 10â6M). The cells were then stimulated with medium (cont) or 100 nM AII for 15 min. Heat-soluble proteins were extracted and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was analyzed by immunoblotting as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further demonstrate the significance of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, we examined the effect of AII in a rat fibroblast cell line expressing a physiological number of human AT1 receptors (Rat1-AT1).3 We have previously shown that AII increases the rate of protein synthesis in Rat1-AT1 cells, similar to its effect on vascular SMC. Treatment of Rat1-AT1 cells with AII also resulted in a significant increase in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 which was prevented by preincubating the cells with losartan (Fig. 3). By contrast, no effect of AII was observed in untransfected Rat1 cells (Fig. 3). Together, these results demonstrate that AII stimulates phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 through activation of the AT1 receptor in target cells. The increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 observed with insulin or serum stimulation is associated with a decreased binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E (21Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. DonzÃ© O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 22Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 25Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). To determine if AII-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 decreases the affinity of the protein for eIF4E, we measured the amount of 4E-BP1 that was recovered by affinity chromatography of cellular lysates through a m7GTP-agarose resin. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with antisera to 4E-BP1 and eIF4E. AII treatment caused a striking reduction in the amount of 4E-BP1 that bound to the cap column, without affecting the binding of eIF4E to the column (Fig. 4). Neither protein was found to interact with the control resin without the cap homolog (not shown). These results clearly indicate that AII-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in aortic SMC promotes the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E in vivo As a first step toward the characterization of the regulatory phosphorylation sites of 4E-BP1, 32P-labeled aortic SMC were stimulated with AII for different times, and 4E-BP1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (Fig. 5A). The labeled bands corresponding to 4E-BP1 were then subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. In quiescent cells, 4E-BP1 was found to be phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues with a predominance of phosphothreonine (Fig. 5B). Stimulation of cells with AII resulted in a significant increase in both the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine content of 4E-BP1 at each time studied (Fig. 5B). No phosphotyrosine was detected in either control or stimulated cells. The phosphorylation sites of 4E-BP1 were further analyzed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. For these experiments, the 32P-labeled 4E-BP1 protein species isolated from extracts of control or AII-treated cells were subjected to extensive trypsin digestion, and the resulting peptides were separated by electrophoresis and ascending chromatography. Representative phosphopeptide maps are shown in Fig. 6. The tryptic peptide map of labeled 4E-BP1 isolated from unstimulated quiescent cells consisted of three major spots (spots 3, 4, and 5) and two minor spots (spots 1 and 2). No significant change in the 32P content of spots 1-5 was observed in cells stimulated with AII for 5 min (Fig. 6C), consistent with the low level of phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 6A). However, when the cells were treated with the hormone for 15 min, the 32P content of all five existing spots increased to varying degrees, and three additional phosphopeptides (labeled 6, 7, and 8) appeared de novo (Fig. 6D). The largest increase in relative 32P content was seen in spot 1. These results demonstrate that 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues in AII-treated aortic SMC. It has been initially suggested that MAP kinase is the main enzyme mediating insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in rat adipocytes (22Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies have seriously questioned the involvement of ERK1/ERK2 in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in vivo (24Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 25Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N.

A. 1996; 93: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Since AII strongly stimulates the enzymatic activity of ERK isoforms in aortic SMC (4Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 36Tsuda T. Kawahara Y. Ishida Y. Koide M. Shii K. Yokoyama M. Circ.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16047-16052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that ERK1/ERK2 could be involved in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in AII-stimulated cells. We first examined the time course of activation of ERK1/ERK2 in AII-stimulated aortic SMC. Fig. 7 shows that the activation of ERK1 is rapid and transient, reaching a maximum between 1 and 5 min, and then declining rapidly to low levels at 15 min. The same kinetics was observed for the ERK2 isoform (data not shown). Thus, the time course of activation of ERK isoforms does not correlate with that of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation which reaches a maximum at 15 min in these cells. We next analyzed the sites on 4E-BP1 that become phosphorylated by the MAP kinase ERK1 in vitro by phosphopeptide mapping. Purified recombinant ERK1 (p44mapk) was activated with MEK1 and incubated with recombinant GST-4E-BP1 in the presence of [Î³-32P]ATP. As previously reported (23Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 4E-BP1 was found to be a good substrate for ERK1 in vitro (Fig. 8A). Analysis of the tryptic peptide map of 4E-BP1 phosphorylated by ERK1 revealed the presence of a single major spot (Fig. 8B). The identity of the phosphorylated site in this peptide has not been determined, but it likely corresponds to Ser-64 which was identified as the major ERK2 phosphorylation site in rat PHAS-I (23Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro map was clearly different from the in vivo tryptic peptide map of 4E-BP1 isolated from AII-stimulated cells (Fig. 6D). Mixing experiments indicated that the ERK1-phosphorylated peptide (peptide a) comigrates with peptide 1 isolated from in vivo labeled cells (data not shown). However, the phosphorylation of this peptide was not increased at a time when ERK1/ERK2 activity is maximal in the cells (see Fig. 6C and Fig. 7). We finally used the recently developed MEK inhibitor PD 98059 (39Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar) to examine the involvement of the ERK pathway in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. We have recently demonstrated that treatment of aortic SMC with 30 Î¼M PD 98059 almost completely suppresses AII-dependent activation of MEKs and, as a consequence, inhibits the activity of the two ERK isoforms (38Servant M.J. Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16047-16052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Quiescent aortic SMC were pretreated with PD 98059 prior to AII stimulation and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was assessed by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 9, inactivation of the ERK pathway with PD 98059 did not affect AII-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in these cells. These data indicate that the MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2 are not involved in the regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by AII in aortic SMC. In this study, we demonstrate that AII increases the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and promotes the dissociation of 4E-BP1Â·eIF4E complexes in rat aortic SMC. These findings define a new mechanism by which the hormone exerts its throphic effects on target cells. To get an insight into the cellular events leading to 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, we have characterized the phosphorylation sites of the protein by phosphoamino acid analysis and two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping. Results of these experiments revealed that 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated in growth-arrested aortic SMC on three major and two minor peptides containing serine or threonine residues. Treatment with AII for 15 min resulted in increased phosphorylation of the five tryptic peptides and generated three additional phosphopeptides de novo These findings indicate that 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated on at least eight distinct regulatory sites in response to AII. Such multiple phosphorylation contrasts with initial reports which suggested that most, if not all, of the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PHAS-I (the rat homolog of 4E-BP1) occurs on a single serine site (23Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While it is certainly conceivable that tyrosine kinase receptor agonists like insulin and G protein-coupled receptor agonists like AII use distinct second messengers and protein kinases to target 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, our results clearly demonstrate that the regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is more complex than originally described. Indeed, more recent data rather suggest that multiple sites in PHAS-I are phosphorylated upon insulin treatment (24Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We have specifically examined the relative contribution of the ERK pathway to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 using a combination of experimental approaches. The following arguments indicate that ERK isoforms are unlikely to be involved in the regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by AII. First, the kinetics of ERK1/EKR2 activation does not correlate with the increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in AII-stimulated aortic SMC. Second, the phosphorylation of the major 4E-BP1 tryptic peptide phosphorylated by ERK1 in vitro is not increased at a time when ERK1/ERK2 activity is already maximal in AII-treated cells. Third, inhibition of ERK1 and ERK2 activation with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 does not interfere with AII-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Thus, the results presented here together with other findings (24Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

The rat 4E-BP1 protein contains multiple consensus phosphoacceptor sites, including seven Ser/Thr-Pro motifs, one protein kinase C site, and four potential casein kinase II sites. In preliminary studies, we found that selective inhibition of protein kinase C or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ attenuate AII-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. These results suggest that protein kinase C might play a critical role in the regulation of 4E-BP1 function, either by phosphorylating the protein directly or by acting upstream of physiological 4E-BP1 kinases. Recent experiments showed that rapamycin, a selective inhibitor of p70S6K activation, blocks the stimulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by growth factors in several cell lines, providing pharmacological evidence for the involvement of a rapamycin-sensitive pathway in the regulation of 4E-BP1 function (24Lin T.-A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the above results suggest that another protein serine/threonine kinase acting downstream of mTOR/FRAP mediates the phosphorylation of the protein. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that AII inhibits the activity of a protein serine/threonine phosphatase in aortic SMC. Studies are currently underway to determine the location of the regulatory phosphorylation sites on 4E-BP1 and to identify the AII signal transduction pathways leading to the increased phosphorylation of the protein. The cellular mechanisms by which AII and G protein-coupled receptor agonists influence the global rate of protein synthesis to induce cell hypertrophy are still poorly understood. However, the recent observation that these factors regulate the phosphorylation state of translational components substantiate the idea that part of their action is exerted at the translational level. In addition to regulating the function of 4E-BP1 (this study), AII has been shown to increase the phosphorylation of eIF4E in vascular SMC (41Rao G.N. Griendling K.K. Frederickson R.M. Sonenberg N. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7180-7184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the consequence of such phosphorylation was not addressed in that study, there is a good correlation between the phosphorylation state of eIF4E and the rate of protein synthesis in living cells (12Redpath N.T.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1996: 245-269Google Scholar). Another mechanism by which AII might stimulate translation is by phosphorylating the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 through the activation of p70S6K (4Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). S6 phosphorylation has been closely correlated with the stimulatory effect of growth factors on translation (42Ferrari S. Thomas G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Our observation that rapamycin treatment of aortic SMC inhibits up to 60-80% of AII-stimulated protein synthesis would be consistent with this notion. However, rapamycin also inhibits translation initiation by blocking 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and inactivating eIF4E (25Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N.

INTRODUCTIONProteins exported across the cytoplasmic membrane to the periplasm or to the outer membrane of Escherichia coli are synthesized as precursors containing an amino-terminal signal sequence. Signal sequences have been proposed to assume several functions in the process of protein secretion, including maintenance of the preprotein in an unfolded conformation (1Park S. Liu G. Topping T.B.

These genes are allelic to secY, secA, and secE, respectively, three genes essential for protein export in vivo; conditional lethal mutations in each of these genes confer a generalized secretion defect (sec mutations). In vitro protein translocation has been achieved with proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified SecA, SecY, and SecE (23Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 24Akimaru J. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6545-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). SecA is a peripheral membrane ATPase (25Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), which promotes preprotein translocation by undergoing ATP-driven cycles of membrane insertion/deinsertion (26Economou A.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). SecY and SecE form a membrane-embedded complex that supports preprotein translocation across the plasma membrane (28Brundage L. Fimmel C.J. Mizushima S. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).SecG, an integral membrane protein that copurifies with the SecY-E complex, stimulates protein translocation both in vivo and in vitro (29Nishiyama K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3409-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 30Nishiyama K. Hanada M. Tokuda H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23625-23631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the gene encoding SecG causes an accumulation of the precursors of exported proteins and confers a cold-sensitive phenotype (30Nishiyama K. Hanada M. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), in some genetic backgrounds (32Bost S. Belin D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, Nishiyama et al. (33Nishiyama K.I. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have proposed that SecG undergoes a topological inversion in the membrane, which is coupled to the SecA insertion-deinsertion cycles, and may thereby ensure a maximal efficiency of protein translocation. Thus, SecG together with SecA, SecY, and SecE constitute the central components of the E. coli translocation machinery.Both sec and prl alleles have been identified in secA/prlD, secY/prlA, and secE/prlG However, the only known mutations in secG are sec alleles; they cause a weak generalized secretion defect and were not isolated in the classic selections for recessive conditional lethal sec mutants that repeatedly identified secA, secY, and secE alleles (32Bost S. Belin D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similarly, previous selections for suppressors of signal sequence mutations, which identified a large number of prlD and prlA alleles, and a more limited number of prlG alleles, did not reveal any prl mutations in secGIn this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of prl alleles of secG, which we propose to call prlH alleles. Using PCR-mutagenized secG plasmid libraries, we screened for mutant alleles that improved MBP export mediated by the mutant signal sequence encoded by the malE18-1 gene. This sensitive screening allowed us to isolate a large number of prlH alleles, representing mutations scattered along the secG sequence. The prlH alleles suppress a variety of signal sequence mutations and the effect of several of them is as strong as that of the strongest known prlG alleles of secE. Finally, our results indicate that prl mutations in secG may also influence the topology of integral membrane proteins.DISCUSSIONThe isolation of suppressors of signal sequence mutations to characterize the genes that encode components of the E. coli translocation machinery has long been validated (52Schatz P.J. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Using a sensitive phenotypic screening and a collection of PCR-mutagenized secG plasmid libraries, we have now identified prl alleles of secG, which could therefore be named prlH/secG, by analogy with prlA/secY, prlD/secA, and prlG/secE Considering the large extent to which this approach has been applied, one could have assumed that all the target genes had already been identified. secG may have escaped previous selections for Prl mutants because of its small size or because of its rather weak suppression efficiency compared with that of most prlA and prlD alleles. However, the effect of several prlH alleles is as strong as that of the strongest known prlG alleles of secE, and prlH alleles should therefore appear in the selections that identified these prlG alleles.In general, prlG alleles are considered as weak suppressors of signal sequence mutations (22Stader J. Gansheroff L.J. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Schatz P.J. Bieker K.L. Ottemann K.M. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), although they are efficient enough to suppress a mutation as severe as the deletion of the lamB signal sequence (16Flower A.M. Doebele R.C. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5607-5614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, prlG1 and prlG2 restore maltose sensitivity to a lamB17D-lacZ fusion strain to a degree comparable to that of the strong prlA4 allele (53Bieker K.L. Silhavy T.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 833-842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similarly, several prlH alleles are potent enough to suppress a complete deletion of the AP signal sequence, and the effect of some of them on the export of the UhpT::PhoA fusions is equivalent to that of the strong prlA666 allele. In any event, prlH suppressors were easily detected by several phenotypic assays, and their phenotype could also be detected by biochemical pulse-chase assays, which are in general less sensitive to reveal small changes in export efficiency.The collection of point mutations in secG that result in a Prl phenotype affect 13 different amino acids and are distributed along the NH2-terminal 2/3 portion of SecG, up to the end of the second transmembrane domain of the protein (Fig. 1). We have previously characterized several mutations in secG that confer a Sec phenotype. These mutant secG were identified in a selection for suppressors of the toxicity of a chimeric protein, in which a mammalian signal sequence is fused to AP (32Bost S. Belin D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All single point mutations isolated mapped to amino acids 41-43, defining a TLF domain between the two transmembrane regions of the protein, and one double mutation mapped to the second transmembrane region. Additional sec mutations were isolated by screening for multicopy dominant sec alleles of secG conferring a Malâ phenotype to a strain carrying the malE19-1 signal sequence mutation (38Bedouelle H. Bassford P.J.J. Fowler A.V. Zabin I. Beckwith J. Hofnung M. Nature. 1980; 285: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Among six mutations isolated, four mapped after the second transmembrane domain of the protein and the two remaining mutations flanked the TLF domain. None of the prl mutations identified in this study map to the codons affected by the sec mutations previously identified, although sec and prl mutations are interspersed in the second transmembrane domain of the protein. The localization of the sec mutations suggested that the normal activity of SecG involves at least three domains: the central TLF domain, the second transmembrane domain, and the COOH-terminal tail (Fig. 1). The distribution of prlH mutations now indicates that other residues in SecG also contributes to its function. Overall, 22 amino acids among 110 residues of SecG can be changed to generate a large spectrum of different phenotypes.Overexpression of components of the translocation machinery such as SecDF and SecA has been shown to result in a Prl phenotype (20Fikes J.D. Bassford P.J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 48Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the case of SecD and SecF, these proteins are present in lower amount than the SecY-E complex, suggesting that they may be limiting factors, particularly for protein export mediated by inefficient signal sequences. We have previously shown that SecG overexpression accelerates the kinetics of export of wild-type proteins. We have now extended this observation and found that SecG overexpression also slightly improved the export of signal sequence-defective preMBP and of signal sequence less AP (data not shown). This reinforces the notion that two types of complexes, with and without SecG, may exist in the cell, and that SecG overexpression accelerates overall protein export by titrating SecY-E complexes to provide fully active complexes. It seems worth emphasizing that the Prl phenotype conferred by the plasmid-encoded prlH suppressors is not simply due to SecG overexpression. Indeed, their Prl phenotype was stronger than that of a plasmid-encoded prlH+. We have verified by Western blot that the level of SecG in strains overexpressing prlH+ or the mutant prlH alleles are indistinguishable (data not shown). Thus, the amino acid substitutions are responsible for the Prl phenotype.prlH suppressors suppress a variety of signal sequence mutations in preMBP and preAP, and some of them also facilitate export of signal sequence less AP. This is similar to the suppression spectrum of several prlA and prlG suppressors, which suppress mutations in the hydrophobic core of signal sequences as well as signal sequence deletions. A variety of prlA alleles improve the signal sequence processing of MBP +3/+4 (45Puziss J.W. Strobel S.M. Bassford P.J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 92-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a preMBP species with an altered charge distribution around the intact hydrophobic core, resulting from the substitution of 2 Glu residues by 2 Arg residues in the amino terminus of the mature portion of MBP. PrlH2 was able to improve by at least 2-fold the processing of MBP +3/+4 (data not shown). This result indicates that the suppressor activity of prlH alleles might not be limited to alterations in the hydrophobic core of signal sequences. Finally, three of the six prlH suppressors assayed were able to increase the translocation efficiency of AP fused to two different transmembrane domains of UhpT, an integral membrane protein. This result suggests that some prlH suppressors that affect the export of signal sequence-defective proteins can also affect the interaction of the translocon with membrane-spanning segments of integral membrane proteins such as UhpT. Alternatively, the Prl phenotype could simply reflect an interaction with the mature portion of AP, since signal sequence less AP is also exported to some extent in prlH suppressors. However, this interpretation is not supported by the observation that some of the prlH alleles, such as prlH4 and prlH5, have a significant effect on signal sequence less AP but not on the UhpT::PhoA fusions. Thus, prl mutations in secG may influence the topology of integral membrane proteins.Different prlH mutations exhibit different pattern and strength of suppression. Whereas prlH3 to prlH6 improve export of signal sequence less AP, as well as that of preMBP and preAP altered in the hydrophobic core of their signal sequence, prlH2 does not suppress the signal sequence mutants of preAP significantly and prlH1 apparently only suppresses MBP18-1 detectably. This probably simply reflects a difference in the effectiveness of suppression, prlH3 to prlH6 being stronger than prlH2, which is itself stronger than prlH1. In any event, there is no evidence for allele specificity in prlH suppression.We have shown previously that sec mutations in secG can affect differently the export efficiency of AP containing either its wild-type signal sequence or a mammalian signal sequence, suggesting that secG contributes to the functional activity of signal sequences. The isolation of prl mutations in secG further support this notion. Taken together, these observations suggest a participation of SecG in signal sequence recognition. However, as repeatedly observed for prlA and prlG suppressors, the lack of allele specificity and the suppression of a complete signal sequence deletion indicate that prlH suppressors may prevent the rejection of defective preproteins from the export pathway, rather than restoring the recognition of altered signal sequences. Thus, prlH suppression would work like prlA and prlG suppression, by loss of the proposed proofreading activity of the translocon (15Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford P.J.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 16Flower A.M. Doebele R.C. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5607-5614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 54Flower A.M. Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 5 among the 16 prlH mutants are charge mutants, all resulting in the introduction of negatively charged residues in between the two transmembrane domains of the protein (Fig. 1). These charge substitutions could modify the dynamics of SecG topology inversion in the membrane (33Nishiyama K.I. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and thus alter the contribution of SecG to the postulated proofreading activity of the translocon. This mechanism of suppression, by loss of a proofreading activity, appears different than that of several prlD suppressors, which exhibit a markedly different pattern of suppression (signal sequences altered in their hydrophilic segment), and do not suppress a complete deletion of the lamB signal sequence (16Flower A.M. Doebele R.C. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5607-5614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Huie and Silhavy (21Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3518-3526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that at least a subset of prlD suppressors affect an activity of SecA related to ATP hydrolysis. However, an independent set of prlD alleles have been shown to suppress signal sequence mutations in the hydrophobic core of preMBP, and some of them also allow export of signal sequence less AP. 2M. Stoll and D. Oliver, personal communication. More recently, it has been shown that prlA suppressor mutations, but not prlG or prlD mutations, were able to relieve the proton motive force dependence of the translocation of a wild-type precursor protein (55Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a translocation defect due to a stably folded structure in the mature domain of proOmpA was suppressed by some prlA suppressor mutations, suggesting that prlA suppression is not restricted to signal sequence defects but extends to defects in mature sequences of precursor proteins. Thus, the mechanism of prl suppression could be more complex and diverse than initially anticipated. The function of SecG in the export process is far from being completely understood. However, the ability of SecG to stimulate protein translocation both in vitro and in vivo, and the isolation of both sec and prl mutations in this gene illustrate the importance of this component of the E. coli translocation machinery for the export process.

Signal sequences have been proposed to assume several functions in the process of protein secretion, including maintenance of the preprotein in an unfolded conformation (1Park S. Liu G. Topping T.B.

These genes are allelic to secY, secA, and secE, respectively, three genes essential for protein export in vivo; conditional lethal mutations in each of these genes confer a generalized secretion defect (sec mutations). In vitro protein translocation has been achieved with proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified SecA, SecY, and SecE (23Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Wickner W.

https://openalex.org/W2136390473,"Previous studies suggested that the interaction between proteins modified by advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and cells, such as macrophages, may be involved in diabetic angiopathy. Pyrraline is one of the AGEs and known to be elevated in plasma of diabetic rats and humans, and is present in vascular lesions of diabetic and elderly subjects. We examined whether modification of albumin by pyrraline influences its degradation by macrophage-like cell line, P388D1 cells. Degradation of pyrraline-modified albumin by these cells was diminished, causing accumulation of the albumin in these cells. The susceptibility of pyrraline-modified albumin to lysosomal proteolytic enzymes was reduced by approximately 40% in vitro, while lysosomal activity in the cells per se was not affected. This phenomenon was also observed when human monocytes were used instead of P388D1 cells. Our results suggest that accumulation of pyrraline-modified albumin in P388D1 cells is due to the reduced susceptibility of the protein to lysosomal enzymatic degradation. Such alterations in the interaction between AGEs-modified protein and phagocytes may contribute to angiopathy in elderly subjects and patients with diabetes.

INTRODUCTIONMaillard reaction (glycation) is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of angiopathy in diabetes and aging process (1Cohen M.P. Diabetes and Protein Glycosylation.

The Maillard Reaction in Aging Diabetes and Nutrition. Alan R. Liss, New York1989Google Scholar). The advanced stage of this reaction that leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) 1The abbreviations used are: AGEadvanced glycation end productBSAbovine serum albuminPyr-BSApyrraline-modified BSARAGEreceptor for AGEVCAM-1vascular cell adhesion molecule-1PBSphosphate-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. is very complex due to several possible metabolic pathways. Despite this complexity, the structures of several AGEs have been recently described, such as that of pyrraline (4Njoroge F.G. Sayre L.M. Monnier V.M. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 167: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), pentosidine (5Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cross-line (6Nakamura K. Hasegawa T. Fukunaga Y. Ienaga K. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1992; 14: 992-994Crossref Google Scholar), and pyrropyridine (7Hayase F. Hinuma H. Asano M. Kato H. Arai S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1936-1937Crossref Google Scholar). Carboxymethyllysine is also formed by oxidation of Amadori products (8Dunn J.A. McCance D.R. Thorpe S.R. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Pyrraline is one of the AGEs derived from the reaction of glucose with the lysine amino group on proteins. Several investigators have demonstrated the preferential accumulation of AGEs in diabetic tissues (9Nakayama H. Mitsuhashi T. Kuwajima S. Aoki S. Kuroda Y. Itoh T. Nakagawa S. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Mitsuhashi T. Nakayama H. Itoh T. Kuwajima S. Aoki S. Atsumi T. Koike T.

Plasma pyrraline levels are also elevated in diabetic rats and humans as determined by ELISA using antibody to pyrraline (14Hayase F. Nagaraj R.H. Miyata S. Njoroge F.G. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3758-3764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Miyata S. Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, Porterootin et al. (16Porterootin M. Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) demonstrated the existence of pyrraline in vivo using high performance liquid chromatography. They also showed that pyrraline in vivo could react with other amino acids on proteins to form cross-links (17Nagaraj R.H. Porterootin M. Monnier V.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that pyrraline is found in vascular lesions of diabetic and elderly subjects using immunohistochemical techniques (15Miyata S. Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Among several pathways forming pyrraline, highly reactive dicarbonyl compounds, such as 3-deoxyglucosone, were identified as precursors reacting with free amino groups to form pyrraline (14Hayase F. Nagaraj R.H. Miyata S. Njoroge F.G. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3758-3764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Miyata S. Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We recently reported that plasma 3-deoxyglucosone levels are elevated in diabetic rats using specific high performance liquid chromatography assay (18Yamada H. Miyata S. Igaki N. Yatabe H. Miyauchi Y. Ohara T. Sakai M. Shoda H. Oimomi M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20275-20280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).AGEs are also known to alter the structural and functional properties of proteins. Furthermore, a pathological role of the interaction between AGEs-modified proteins and cells for diabetic complications has been recently proposed. Several cell surface proteins are thought to recognize AGEs (19Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20Schmidt A.M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J. Esposito C. Hegarty H. Hurley W. Clauss M. Wang F. Pan Y-C.E. Tsang T.C.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interaction between AGEs and these proteins induces a variety of secondary effects. Vlassara et al. (22Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Manogue K.R. Dinarello C. Pasagian A. Science. 1988; 240: 1546-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) demonstrated that macrophages secrete cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, following the recognition of AGEs through specific receptors. They also showed the induction of insulin-like growth factor in human monocytes by AGEs-modified protein (23Kirstein M. Aston C. Hintz R. Vlassara H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Saishoji et al. (24Saishoji T. Higashi T. Ikeda K. Sano H. Jinnouchi Y. Ogawa M. Horiuchi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) also suggested that AGEs-modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) stimulated the activity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator through the scavenger receptor on RAW 246.7 cell line. Schmidt et al. (25Schmidt A.M. Hori O. Chen J.X. Li J.F. Crandall J. Zhang J.H. Cao R. Yan S.D. Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 96: 1395-1403Crossref Scopus (813) Google Scholar) recently reported that the recognition of AGEs by receptors for AGEs, so-called RAGE, leads to the expression of VCAM-1. The interaction between AGEs and cells in the blood or vascular tissue as mentioned above may consequently cause angiopathy. In fact, several lines of evidence have shown the existence of AGEs in vascular lesions (11Nakamura Y. Horii Y. Nishino T. Shiiki H. Sakaguchi Y. Kagoshima T. Dohi K. Makita Z. Vlassara H. Bucala R. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1649-1656PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kume S. Takeya M. Mori T. Araki N. Suzuki H. Horiuchi S. Kodama T. Miyauchi Y. Takahashi K. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 654-667PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact moiety of AGEs-modified protein recognized by the cells is not yet known.In the present study, we investigated a pyrraline-modified protein that had been demonstrated to localize at thickened intima of arteriosclerotic lesion in the kidney of diabetic patients (15Miyata S. Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of modification of albumin by pyrraline on the degradation of the protein by macrophage-like cell line, P388D1 cells. This cell line was originally isolated by Dawe and Potter (26Dawe C. Potter M. Am. J. Pathol. 1957; 33: 603Google Scholar) from a methylcholanthrene-induced lymphoid neoplasm of a DBA/2 mouse. Subsequent investigation by Koren et al. (27Koren H.S. Handwerger B.S. Wunderlich J.R. J. Immunol. 1975; 114: 894-897PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that these cells have macrophage-like characteristics. Among these, the P388D1 cells have phagocytic activity and are rich in lysosomal vesicles.DISCUSSIONThe present study was based on the recent demonstration of pyrraline in arteriosclerotic lesions and designed to examine the relationship defining the interaction between pyrraline-modified protein and blood cells, such as macrophages, with the progress of angiopathy. The deposition of pyrraline in arteriosclerotic lesions is somewhat similar to cholesterol deposition in atherosclerotic lesions. The latter is known to be associated with the uptake of chemically modified low density lipoprotein by scavenger receptor of monocytes/macrophages (37Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several receptors, including scavenger receptor and RAGE, are thought to recognize AGEs-modified proteins (19Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20Schmidt A.M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J. Esposito C. Hegarty H. Hurley W.

Takahashi K. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Vlassara et al. (19Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) reported that the uptake and degradation of AGE-modified BSA is achieved thorough a high-affinity receptor on mouse macrophages. The removal of AGE-modified protein by such mechanism is an attractive hypothesis of tissue remodeling. However, accumulation of AGEs-modified BSA was still present in the cells examined by Vlassara et al. (19Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), presumably due to an inefficient degradation compared with albumin uptake. Furthermore, these investigators also reported accumulation of AGEs-modified nerve myelin in macrophages and proposed that the interaction between AGEs-modified nerve protein and macrophages may initiate demyelination in diabetes (38Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this regard, the exact structure of AGEs moiety recognized by the receptor is still unknown. Furthermore, the exact effect of AGEs modification is complicated by the presence of heterogeneous AGEs. Therefore, we focused in the present study on pyrraline-modified protein as a ligand, since its structure had been identified. Using pyrraline as a model of AGEs, estimation of the involvement of the modification became more accessible. The P388D1 used in this study is an established macrophage-like cell line with phagocytic activity. Westwood et al. (39Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32293-32298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recently showed the existence of receptor recognizing methylglyoxal-modified protein on P388D1 cell surface. Although we attempted to identify a high-affinity cell surface receptor against pyrraline, we were unable to find such receptor in the range of ligand concentration examined (data not shown). Since P388D1 cells are able to phagocyte albumin themselves, pyrraline-modified BSA may not be necessarily recognized at the pyrraline moiety. However, the possible existence of a lower-affinity receptor cannot be excluded completely at present.Our results showed that pyrraline-modified albumin was resistant to degradation by the cells. This finding suggests that pyrraline-modified albumin may have affected lysosomal proteolytic function of P388D1 cells. Alternatively, the susceptibility of albumin to proteolysis was modified by pyrraline. To examine the first mechanism, we compared lysosomal function of cells preincubated with control and pyrraline-modified albumin. Our results showed that the activities of two representative lysosomal enzymes, acid phosphatase and Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase, were not significantly different. On the other hand, the susceptibility of pyrraline-modified albumin to enzymatic proteolysis by cathepsin D was significantly reduced in vitro Albumin is known to be degraded mainly by cathepsin D and E in the lysosome (40Mycek M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 285-315Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since it is difficult to examine the susceptibility of pyrraline-modified albumin to all lysosomal proteolytic enzymes, we fractionated lysosome-rich fraction by sequential centrifugations. These studies showed that pyrraline-modified albumin was resistant to digestion by lysosome-rich fraction as well as cathepsin D alone. These findings are consistent with the well known fact that collagen diminishes its enzymatic digestibility as it is modified by AGEs (41Schnider S.L. Kohn R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 42Brennan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20947-20952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the degree of pyrraline modification observed at approximately 10 mol/mol BSA was sufficient to reveal the resistance against enzymatic digestion. Although the reduced digestibility was dependent on the degree of modification, the modification induced by an initial 10 mol/mol BSA showed more suppressive effect than an additional 10 mol. Interestingly, the rate of reduction of digestibility of pyrraline-modified BSA by cathepsin D or lysosome-rich fraction in vitro was almost identical to that observed in the degradation of pyrraline-modified albumin in experiments using P388D1 cells. Thus, we believe that the main cause of suppression of degradation by phagocytes is more likely to be a decrease in the susceptibility to lysosomal proteolytic digestion in P388D1 cells. It is conceivable that the suppression of degradation leads to accumulation of pyrraline-modified albumin in the cells. In addition, the recent finding of pyrraline accumulation in lesions of Alzheimer disease, such as neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, suggests a potential role for AGEs, including pyrraline, in the protease-resistance property of the lesions (43Smith M.A. Taneda S. Richey P.L. Miyata S. Yan S-D. Stern D. Sayre L.M. Monnier V.M. Perry G. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5710-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar).The present results also showed accumulation of pyrraline-modified albumin in human monocytes as well as P388D1 cell line. Plasma pyrraline levels were shown to be elevated in diabetic rats and humans as determined by ELISA using monoclonal antibody to pyrraline (15Miyata S. Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Calculating the pyrraline modification per mol of albumin from the findings, some diabetic subject showed about 0.6 mol of pyrraline/mol. Diabetic rats, showing higher blood glucose levels, indicated more extensive modification such as 1.3 mol/mol. Since glycation does not occur uniformly to all albumin molecules, the degree of the modification in relatively longer-lived molecule may be more extensive than the average value described above. In fact, AGEs formed in albumin in vivo is expected to be very heterogeneous. In addition to pyrraline, pentosidine has been reported to increase in diabetic plasma (44Odetti P. Fogarty J. Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 153-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Taneda S. Monnier V.M. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Concerning other AGEs, Makita et al. (13Makita Z. Vlassara H. Cerami A. Bucala R. J. Biol.

Although structures of the AGEs epitope recognized by the antibody still remains to be identified, their findings support that serum protein is extensively modified by unknown AGEs as well as pyrraline in diabetic patients. Since the decrease in the susceptibility of pyrraline-modified albumin to lysosomal enzymes, observed in the present study, seems attributable to the covalent modification of the substrate albumin, it may be deduced that AGE modifications other than pyrraline also have similar inhibitory effects on enzymatic degradation of albumin. Kato et al. (46Kato H. Shin D.B. Hayase F. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 2009-2011Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) showed that incubation of human serum albumin with glucose under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37Â°C) in vitro caused the decrease in intact lysine residues by 19%, comparable to our pyrraline-modified albumin. Iberg and FlÃ¼ckiger (47Iberg N. FlÃ¼ckiger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13542-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also indicated that 10 lysine residues were the most susceptible glycation sites by amino acid analysis of tryptic-digested albumin from diabetic patients. Lapolla et al. (48Lapolla A. Fedele D. Seraglia R. Catinella S. Baldo L. Aronica R. Traldi P. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) more directly determined the extent of glycation in serum albumin from diabetic patients, using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization method. They proved that the number of modified residues in a mole of albumin was from 1.4 to 14.8. These findings support that the extent of modification of albumin in the present study is in the physiological range. These AGE-modified proteins in the circulation of diabetic patients may accumulate in monocytes/macrophages in vivo Steinbrecher and Witztum (49Steinbrecher U.P. Witztum J.L. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) also demonstrated an inhibitory effect of glycation on the degradation of low-density lipoproteins in cultured fibroblasts. They also suggested that the inhibitory effect was due to a modification in lysine residues of apoprotein B. With respect to protein catabolism, the modification of lysine residues by AGEs may be more critical, since the alteration is irreversible. In fact, the levels of AGE in low-density lipoproteins of diabetic patients are also elevated, as reported by Bucala et al. (50Bucala R. Makita Z. Koschinsky T. Cerami A. Vlassara H. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6434-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The exact nature of changes affecting the property of these cells following accumulation of AGE-modified protein is under investigation. Considering the fact that chemical modification of low-density lipoproteins is a trigger for atherosclerosis, modification of albumin by AGEs, such as pyrraline, may be also involved in vascular disorders. The present findings may help to elucidate the mechanisms involved in AGE modification of constitutively existing proteins in vivo causing a change in their metabolism, and subsequently, initiation of diabetic complications. INTRODUCTIONMaillard reaction (glycation) is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of angiopathy in diabetes and aging process (1Cohen M.P. Diabetes and Protein Glycosylation.

The Maillard Reaction in Aging Diabetes and Nutrition. Alan R. Liss, New York1989Google Scholar). The advanced stage of this reaction that leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) 1The abbreviations used are: AGEadvanced glycation end productBSAbovine serum albuminPyr-BSApyrraline-modified BSARAGEreceptor for AGEVCAM-1vascular cell adhesion molecule-1PBSphosphate-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. is very complex due to several possible metabolic pathways. Despite this complexity, the structures of several AGEs have been recently described, such as that of pyrraline (4Njoroge F.G. Sayre L.M. Monnier V.M. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 167: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), pentosidine (5Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cross-line (6Nakamura K. Hasegawa T. Fukunaga Y. Ienaga K. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1992; 14: 992-994Crossref Google Scholar), and pyrropyridine (7Hayase F. Hinuma H. Asano M. Kato H. Arai S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1936-1937Crossref Google Scholar). Carboxymethyllysine is also formed by oxidation of Amadori products (8Dunn J.A. McCance D.R. Thorpe S.R. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Pyrraline is one of the AGEs derived from the reaction of glucose with the lysine amino group on proteins. Several investigators have demonstrated the preferential accumulation of AGEs in diabetic tissues (9Nakayama H. Mitsuhashi T. Kuwajima S. Aoki S. Kuroda Y. Itoh T. Nakagawa S. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Mitsuhashi T. Nakayama H. Itoh T. Kuwajima S. Aoki S. Atsumi T. Koike T.

Plasma pyrraline levels are also elevated in diabetic rats and humans as determined by ELISA using antibody to pyrraline (14Hayase F. Nagaraj R.H. Miyata S. Njoroge F.G. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3758-3764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Miyata S. Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, Porterootin et al. (16Porterootin M. Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) demonstrated the existence of pyrraline in vivo using high performance liquid chromatography. They also showed that pyrraline in vivo could react with other amino acids on proteins to form cross-links (17Nagaraj R.H. Porterootin M. Monnier V.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that pyrraline is found in vascular lesions of diabetic and elderly subjects using immunohistochemical techniques (15Miyata S. Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Among several pathways forming pyrraline, highly reactive dicarbonyl compounds, such as 3-deoxyglucosone, were identified as precursors reacting with free amino groups to form pyrraline (14Hayase F. Nagaraj R.H. Miyata S. Njoroge F.G. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3758-3764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Miyata S. Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We recently reported that plasma 3-deoxyglucosone levels are elevated in diabetic rats using specific high performance liquid chromatography assay (18Yamada H. Miyata S. Igaki N. Yatabe H. Miyauchi Y. Ohara T. Sakai M. Shoda H. Oimomi M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20275-20280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).AGEs are also known to alter the structural and functional properties of proteins. Furthermore, a pathological role of the interaction between AGEs-modified proteins and cells for diabetic complications has been recently proposed. Several cell surface proteins are thought to recognize AGEs (19Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interaction between AGEs and these proteins induces a variety of secondary effects. Vlassara et al. (22Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Manogue K.R. Dinarello C. Pasagian A. Science. 1988; 240: 1546-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) demonstrated that macrophages secrete cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, following the recognition of AGEs through specific receptors. They also showed the induction of insulin-like growth factor in human monocytes by AGEs-modified protein (23Kirstein M. Aston C. Hintz R. Vlassara H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Saishoji et al. (24Saishoji T. Higashi T. Ikeda K. Sano H. Jinnouchi Y. Ogawa M. Horiuchi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Schmidt et al. (25Schmidt A.M. Hori O. Chen J.X. Li J.F. Crandall J. Zhang J.H. Cao R. Yan S.D. Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 96: 1395-1403Crossref Scopus (813) Google Scholar) recently reported that the recognition of AGEs by receptors for AGEs, so-called RAGE, leads to the expression of VCAM-1. The interaction between AGEs and cells in the blood or vascular tissue as mentioned above may consequently cause angiopathy. In fact, several lines of evidence have shown the existence of AGEs in vascular lesions (11Nakamura Y. Horii Y. Nishino T. Shiiki H. Sakaguchi Y. Kagoshima T. Dohi K. Makita Z. Vlassara H. Bucala R.

However, the exact moiety of AGEs-modified protein recognized by the cells is not yet known.In the present study, we investigated a pyrraline-modified protein that had been demonstrated to localize at thickened intima of arteriosclerotic lesion in the kidney of diabetic patients (15Miyata S. Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of modification of albumin by pyrraline on the degradation of the protein by macrophage-like cell line, P388D1 cells. This cell line was originally isolated by Dawe and Potter (26Dawe C. Potter M. Am. J. Pathol. 1957; 33: 603Google Scholar) from a methylcholanthrene-induced lymphoid neoplasm of a DBA/2 mouse. Subsequent investigation by Koren et al. (27Koren H.S. Handwerger B.S. Wunderlich J.R. J. Immunol. 1975; 114: 894-897PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that these cells have macrophage-like characteristics. Among these, the P388D1 cells have phagocytic activity and are rich in lysosomal vesicles."

In this study, antisense oligonucleotides targeted to TNFÎ± mRNA were used to inhibit silica-induced TNFÎ± gene expression in alveolar macrophages. To achieve macrophage-specific oligonucleotide delivery, a molecular conjugate consisting of mannosylated polylysine that exploits endocytosis via the macrophage mannose receptor was used. Complexes were formed between the mannosylated polylysine and oligonucleotides and added to the cells in the presence of silica. Enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay showed that the complex consisting of the conjugate and antisense oligomer effectively inhibited TNFÎ± production, whereas the oligomer alone had much less effect. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the reduction in TNFÎ± secretion was associated with specific ablation of targeted TNFÎ± mRNA. The conjugate alone or conjugate complexed with inverted or sense sequence oligonucleotide had no effect. The promoting effect of the conjugate on antisense activity was shown to be due to enhanced cellular uptake of the oligomer via mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Although the role of TNFÎ± in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis has been well studied, relatively little is known about its molecular regulation during the fibrotic process. This information is important not only for the understanding of the molecular mechanism of disease pathogenesis but also for the development of potential therapeutic interventions. tumor necrosis factor-Î± alveolar macrophage bovine serum albumin mannosylated polylysine oligonucleotide reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction antisense-ON with a sequence complementary to the initiation codon on TNFÎ± mRNA inverted sequence sense sequence. The ability to regulate expression of an individual gene by the use of an antisense oligonucleotide (ON) complementary to a specific sequence of mRNA provides a powerful tool for elucidating the role of a particular gene and may allow therapeutic intervention when that gene is overexpressed (5Stein C.A. Cheng Y.C. Science. 1993; 261: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). The strong binding affinity of ONs to their mRNA targets makes these compounds potent and specific inhibitors of gene expression (6Crooke S.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 329-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). To take advantage of this specificity, however, the ONs must also be delivered selectively to the intended target cells, where they can find and bind to their target mRNA sequences. The lung represents a major target for antisense therapy for diseases such as cancer and fibrosis. However, the complex anatomy of the lung as well as the presence of numerous lung cell types make ON targeting in this organ difficult. Furthermore, ONs are structurally bulky and highly charged, so their cellular uptake is generally low (7Rojanasakul Y. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1996; 18: 115-131Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and must be enhanced. Receptor-mediated endocytosis offers the potential to target a selected cell population and enhance cellular uptake of ONs. This method has been used successfully to aid ON delivery in selected cell types (8Bunnell B.A. Askari F.K. Wilson J.M. Somatic Cell Mol.

For example, asialoorosomucoid-polylysine conjugates have been used to target ONs to HepG2 and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cells (8Bunnell B.A. Askari F.K. Wilson J.M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Wu G.Y. Wu C.H. J. Biol.

In the lung, alveolar macrophages (AMs) represent a major target for dust-induced pulmonary fibrosis. These cells are also major sources of TNFÎ± production in the lung. The AMs possess mannose-specific membrane receptors that can recognize and internalize glycoproteins bearing mannose residues (12Stahl P. Rodman J.S. Miller M.J. Schlesinger P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1399-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 13Stahl P. Schlesinger P.H. Sigardson E. Rodman J.S. Lee Y.C. Cell. 1980; 19: 207-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). On this basis, mannosylated glycoproteins could potentially be used to target and enhance ON uptake by the AMs. Targeted delivery of several cytotoxic drugs and antiviral agents by glycoproteins specific to macrophages has been demonstrated previously (14Roche A.C. Barzillay M. Midoux P. Junqua S. Sharon N. Monsigny M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 22: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Duncan R. Kopeckova-Rejmanova P. Strohalm J. Hume I.

Moreover, 6-phosphomannosylated glycoproteins have also been used to target antisense ONs to peritoneal macrophages (16Bonfils E. Depierreux C. Midoux P. Thuong N.T. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4621-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study, we utilized mannosylated polylysine (MPL) as a drug-targeting vector to aid the cellular delivery of ONs to the AMs. The effectiveness of this system in promoting antisense activity and its mechanism of enhancement were evaluated. Nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate ON with a sequence complementary to the initiation codon of TNFÎ± mRNA (17Pennica D. Hayflick J.S. Bringman T.S. Palladino M.A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A fluorescent label was sometimes attached to the terminal 5â² linkage group by the use of 5â²-carboxyfluorescein phosphoramidite. The ONs were purified by high performance liquid chromatography and were >98% pure. The MPL was synthesized according to the method previously described (18McBroom C.R. Samanen C.H. Goldstein I.J. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 212-219Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly-L-lysine (Sigma, 0.25 Î¼mol, Mrâ 10,000) was dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 9.0 using 0.1 N NaOH. 4-Isothiocyanatophenyl-Î±-D-mannoside (Sigma, 12.5 Î¼mol) was added in small portions to the magnetically stirred protein solution. After a 6-h reaction, the resulting solution was refrigerated overnight, and on the following day the pH was adjusted to 7.0. Unreacted mannoside and polylysine were removed by centrifugal filtration through a dialysis membrane filter (Duraporeâ¢ CL3K, Millipore Corp.) at 5000 Ã g for 30 min. The degree of sugar substitution was determined by the resorcinol sulfuric assay (19Monsigny M. Petit C. Roche A.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The percentage of sugar in MPL was determined using the equation X% = n Ã Mo/(Mp+ n Ã M), where n is the number of mannose residues per polylysine molecule and Mo, Mp, and M are the molecular weights of mannose, polylysine, and isothiocyanatophenylmannoside, respectively. The MPL prepared under this condition was found to contain â25% sugar. In a typical experiment, the complex was prepared by adding 25 Î¼l of 50 Î¼g/ml MPL to 25 Î¼l of 50 Î¼g/ml ON in culture medium for 1 h prior to use. In studies designed to evaluate the dose effect of ON, various concentrations of ON (25-100 Î¼g/ml) were used. Complex formation was verified by gel electrophoresis using a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel. Using a dual fluorescence labeling technique, we previously found that both the ON and MPL, when prepared as a complex under this condition, were co-internalized by the AMs (20Liang W.W. Shi X. Deshpande D. Malanga C.J. Rojanasakul Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In a separate study, the stability of ON and ONÂ·MPL complex was studied in culture medium using gel electrophoresis. After a 7-h incubation at 37Â°C, no detectable degradative products of ONs were observed. The AMs were harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) by bronchoalveolar lavage. Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (0.2 g/kg of body weight). The trachea was cannulated and the lungs lavaged 10 times with 8-ml aliquots of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.9 mM NaH2PO4, 5.5 mM glucose, pH 7.4). Lavaged cell suspensions were centrifuged at 500 Ã g for 10 min at 4Â°C. The cell pellets were washed twice by alternate resuspension and centrifugation in macrophage-serum-free medium, pH 7.4 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell number and purity of the macrophage preparations were determined using a Coulter electronic cell counter with a cell-sizing attachment (Coulter Instrument, Hialeah, FL). The average values for yield and purity were 6.2 Â± 0.3 Ã 106 cells/rat and 92.5 Â± 0.4%, respectively. Cell viability, measured via trypan blue exclusion, was >95%. Aliquots of 0.1 ml containing 105 cells were added onto a 96-well plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and incubated at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. In studies involving the use of alveolar epithelial cells, the lungs were lavaged as described above. They were then excised and incubated for 20 min at 37Â°C with phosphate-buffered saline containing elastase (40 units/ml, Type I, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and DNase (0.006%, Sigma). After enzymatic digestion, the lungs were finely minced and the digestion was arrested by incubation for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 25% fetal bovine serum and 0.006% DNase (to help prevent cell clumping). The crude extract was sequentially filtered through 160- and 45-Î¼m screens and centrifuged, and the resulting cell pellet was spun on a sterile Percoll density gradient. The second cell band from the surface was collected, washed twice, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cell suspension yielded 15-20 Ã 106 cells/rat with viability greater than 95% as determined by the Coulter counter and trypan blue exclusion. J774.1 cells, a macrophage cell line deficient in mannose receptors (21Stahl P.D. Wileman T.E. Diment S. Shepherd V.L. Biol. Cell. 1984; 51: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. They were maintained at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Prior to use, the cells were washed and resuspended in macrophage-serum-free medium culture medium. Cells were plated on a 96-well plate at the density of 105 cells/well. They were treated with heat-sterilized silica (Mil-U-Sil, endotoxin-free, Pennsylvania Glass and Sand Corp.) or titanium dioxide (a nonfibrogenic dust control) (Fisher), both at final concentrations of 10-100 Î¼g/ml. To test the effect of ONs on TNFÎ± expression, the cells were simultaneously treated with free oligomers (AS-ON, INV-ON, or S-ON) (25 Î¼g/ml) or oligomers complexed with MPL (ONÂ·MPL, 25:25 Î¼g/ml). After a 7-h incubation at 37Â°C, the culture medium was collected and analyzed for TNFÎ± using a Genzyme TNFÎ± enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay kit (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This assay is specific for TNFÎ± and does not cross-react with other cytokines, as stated by the manufacturer. Analysis of TNFÎ± mRNA was also performed using RT-PCR assay. Total RNA was extracted from cells following treatments. Lysis buffer (500 Î¼l) containing 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.65% Nonidet P-40 was added to a cell pellet containing approximately 106 cells. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 4Â°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of urea-SDS buffer (7 M urea, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). Then protein precipitation was carried out in the presence of 2 M NaCl. The tubes were centrifuged and RNA was precipitated from the supernatant with 2 volumes of ethanol. Reverse transcription and PCR (2 Î¼g of RNA) were performed using a Clontech RT-PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech Laboratories). Reactions were performed on a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler (model 480). As an internal standard, Î²-actin cDNA was also amplified. Samples were denatured for 2 min at 94Â°C and then amplified for 25 cycles, with each cycle consisting of three heated segments: 94Â°C for 30 s, 55Â°C for 30 s, and 74Â°C for 90 s. Samples were held for a further 10 min at 74Â°C on the final cycle. The primers used were based on those previously reported (22Nicholson W.J. Slight J. Donaldson K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Reaction products were precipitated and separated on a 7% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Cellular uptake studies were conducted using fluorescently labeled AS-ON. The cells (105/well) were plated on a 96-well plate and incubated for 4 h at 37Â°C in culture medium containing AS-ON (25 Î¼g/ml) or AS-ONÂ·MPL complex (25:25 Î¼g/ml). The cells were washed with cold medium containing excess unlabeled ON and/or MPL to remove surface-bound labeled ON. The cells were then measured for their fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence microplate reader at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 520 nm, respectively. For competitive inhibition studies, cells were treated with the AS-ONÂ·MPL complex in the presence of 1 mg/ml mannosylated BSA (a specific competitor for mannose receptors) (Sigma) or BSA (a nonspecific competitor). Cell viability was determined using fluorescence propidium iodide assay. After specific treatments the cells were incubated with 1 Î¼g/ml propidium iodide in culture medium for 10 min at 37Â°C. Cellular fluorescence intensity was then measured at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 600 nm, respectively. Cell survival was calculated as percentage cell survival = 100 â percentage cell death. Percentage cell death =measured signal â minimum signalmaximum signal â minimum signal Ã 100% The maximum signal is the fluorescence signal obtained in the presence of Triton X-100 (0.1%), which was used to permeabilize the cells. The minimum signal is the background autofluorescence signal. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance with the use of the Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. Exposure of the AMs to crystalline silica (10-100 Î¼g/ml) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in TNFÎ± secretion over nontreated controls (Fig. 1). Treatment of the cells with nonfibrogenic dust titanium dioxide at similar concentrations had no significant effect on TNFÎ± secretion (Fig. 1). In order to assess the potential inhibitory effect of antisense ONs on silica-stimulated TNFÎ± release, AS-ON (25 Î¼g/ml) or AS-ONÂ·MPL complex (25:25 Î¼g/ml) was added to the cells simultaneously with silica (100 Î¼g/ml). As controls, noncomplementary ON sequences (INV-ON and S-ON) and their respective MPL complexes (INV-ONÂ·MPL and S-ONÂ·MPL) at the same concentrations were also used. Our results, shown in Fig. 2, indicated that treatment of the cells with free AS-ON had no significant effect on TNFÎ± level (p < 0.05). However, when the AS-ON was given as a complex (AS-ONÂ·MPL), >90% of the TNFÎ± secretion was inhibited. Non-antisense ONs, given either alone or in the form of complexes, had no effect on TNFÎ± level (p < 0.05). The latter results suggested that the inhibitory effect of AS-ONÂ·MPL complex was not due to MPL and that the presence of AS-ON was required for the anti-TNFÎ± effect. Studies using MPL alone (see below) further confirmed this point.Fig. 2Antisense activity of ON mediated by MPL. Cells (105/well) were incubated with silica (100 Î¼g/ml) in the presence or absence (Control) of free ON (25 Î¼g/ml) or ONÂ·MPL complex (25:25 Î¼g/ml). After a 7-h incubation at 37Â°C, the culture samples were collected and analyzed for TNFÎ±. The values represent mean Â± S.E., n = 4. Asterisk indicates significant difference from control (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of AS-ONÂ·MPL complex to suppress TNFÎ± production at the cellular level leads to the question of its molecular mechanism of TNFÎ± inhibition. To address this query, AS-ONÂ·MPL complex (25:25 Î¼g/ml) was added to the AMs in the presence of silica (100 Î¼g/ml), and 4 h later mRNA for TNFÎ± was recovered and assessed by RT-PCR analysis. As controls, AS-ON (25 Î¼g/ml), INV-ON (25 Î¼g/ml), or MPL (25 Î¼g/ml) alone were also tested (Fig. 3). The addition of AS-ONÂ·MPL complex reduced the expression of silica-induced TNFÎ± mRNA, whereas all other control treatments had no effect. These results are consistent with the earlier enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay studies and suggest that the mechanism of TNFÎ± inhibition by the AS-ON complex is due to translational inhibition of TNFÎ± mRNA. The lack of the inhibitory effect of free AS-ON is somewhat surprising but may be attributed to its poor cellular uptake and the inability to reach its intracellular target. Because previous studies have established that cellular uptake of ONs is dose-dependent (6Crooke S.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 329-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), we therefore investigated the effect of ON concentration (25-100 Î¼g/ml) on silica-induced TNFÎ± production (Fig. 4). Our result showed that an increase in ON concentration (AS-ON), as expected, resulted in a corresponding increase in TNFÎ± inhibition. A significant inhibitory effect (â35%) was observed at the AS-ON concentration of 75 Î¼g/ml (p < 0.05). At the highest concentration tested (100 Î¼g/ml), â50% inhibition was observed. The control INV-ON had no significant effect on TNFÎ± production at all concentrations tested except at 100 Î¼g/ml, at which concentration a minimal but significant effect was observed (â15%) (p < 0.05). This latter result suggested the possible nonsequence-specific effect of ON, which has been reported in other systems when high concentrations of ONs are used (23Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Storey A. Oates D. Banks L. Crawford L. Crook T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4109-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The potential cytotoxic effect of ONs at high concentrations was also examined using fluorescence propidium iodide assay. The percentage of cells viable after treatment with 100 Î¼g/ml AS-ON was 94 Â± 5 and 92 Â± 4% for INV-ON. These values were not significantly different from that of the nontreated control (95 Â± 4%) (p < 0.05, n = 4). To further examine the promoting effect of MPL on antisense activity of AS-ON, cellular uptake studies were conducted. In these studies, 5â² fluorescently labeled AS-ON was used to allow direct detection of cellular uptake. AS-ON (25 Î¼g/ml) or AS-ONÂ·MPL complex (25:25 Î¼g/ml) was added to the AMs, and after indicated time intervals the cells were washed and analyzed for their fluorescence intensity. As shown in Fig. 5, the MPL greatly promoted the cellular uptake of AS-ON. At 4 h of incubation, the uptake of the complex was found to be â17-fold greater than that of the free AS-ON. This result indicated that the MPL carrier system was highly effective at promoting the cellular uptake of AS-ON and that the AS-ON alone was poorly taken up by the AMs. The saturable nature of the complex uptake is indicative of receptor-mediated endocytosis. To test whether the cellular uptake of the MPL complex occurred via mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis, cellular uptake of the AS-ONÂ·MPL complex in the presence of competition for mannose receptors was carried out. In these experiments, the AS-ONÂ·MPL complex was incubated with the AMs in the presence of an excess amount of a specific mannose receptor competitor, mannosylated BSA, or a nonspecific competitor, BSA (Fig. 6). These results demonstrated that the cellular uptake of the AS-ONÂ·MPL complex was inhibited by mannosylated BSA but not by BSA, thus indicating that the ON uptake mediated by MPL occurred via the mannose receptor pathway. To further confirm the mechanism of AS-ON complex uptake and to test the potential targeting ability of the MPL system, uptake studies were repeated in the J774.1 macrophage cell line, which is known to express a low level of mannose receptors (21Stahl P.D. Wileman T.E. Diment S. Shepherd V.L. Biol. Cell. 1984; 51: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and in alveolar epithelial cells, which lack mannose receptors (Fig. 6). Both cell types exhibited a much lower complex uptake compared with the AMs (p < 0.05), thus confirming the mannose receptor-mediated complex uptake and the targeting ability of the MPL carrier system. Pulmonary macrophages are known to be sources of inflammatory mediators and fibrogenic factors and are one of the first cells to respond to inhaled particles in the lung. Several studies have shown that TNFÎ± plays an important role in the pathogenesis of silicotic fibrosis. Driscoll et al. (1Driscoll K.E. Linderschmidt R.C. Maurer J.K. Higgins J.M. Ridder G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) demonstrated an increase in TNFÎ± production by the AMs in rats treated with silica. Piguet et al (2Piguet P.F. Collart M.A. Grau G.E. Sappino A.-P. Vassalli P. Nature. 1990; 344: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) later showed that this increase in TNFÎ± production was associated with increased expression of TNFÎ± mRNA in the lung, although the cellular origin of TNFÎ± was not identified in this study. The work by Piguet et al (2Piguet P.F. Collart M.A. Grau G.E. Sappino A.-P. Vassalli P. Nature. 1990; 344: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that pretreatment of the animals with anti-TNFÎ± IgG or exogenous recombinant TNFÎ± reduced and augmented, respectively, silica-induced fibrosis. Thus, these studies strongly indicate the role of TNFÎ± in silicotic fibrosis. There are, however, a number of studies that have reported contradictory results. Mohr et al. (25Mohr C. Gemsa D. Graebner C. Hemenway D.R. Leslie K.O. Absher P.M. Davis G.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and Lemaire (26Lemaire I. Pulmonary Fibrosis: Lung Biology in Health and Disease. 80. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) showed that silica treatment in rats had no effect on TNFÎ± production by the AMs. Bissonnette and Rola-Pleszczynski (27Bissonnette E. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Inflammation. 1989; 13: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) similarly reported the lack of silica effect in mice. The discrepancies between test results by different groups may be attributed to differences in experimental conditions, i.e. the dose and type of silica used and the mode of silica instillation. With regard to the dose, Driscoll et al. (1Driscoll K.E. Linderschmidt R.C. Maurer J.K. Higgins J.M. Ridder G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) showed that silica stimulation of TNFÎ± release occurred only at doses greater than 50 mg/kg. Lemaire (26Lemaire I. Pulmonary Fibrosis: Lung Biology in Health and Disease. 80. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) also reported the lack of silica effect on TNFÎ± release at a low silica dose of 15 mg/kg. In agreement with these in vivo data, our in vitro results indicated a dose-dependent effect of silica on TNFÎ± production by the AMs. Silica directly stimulated TNFÎ± secretion and mRNA expression, effects that were not observed with the nonfibrogenic dust titanium dioxide. These results confirm and extend those of Gosset et al. (28Gosset P. Lassalle P. Vanhee D. Wallaert B. Aerts C. Voisin C. Tonnel A.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and Driscoll et al. (29Driscoll K.E. Higgins J.M. Leytart M.J. Crosby L.L. Toxicol. In Vitro. 1990; 4: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), who reported a direct effect of silica on TNFÎ± production in isolated human and rat AMs, and those of Savici et al. (30Savici D. He B. Geist L.J. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Exp. Lung Res. 1994; 20: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), who reported an elevated TNFÎ± gene expression in THP-1 myelomonocytic cells following silica treatment. The regulatory role of TNFÎ± in fibrogenesis and its potential therapeutic intervention can be studied at the molecular level using antisense ONs. These compounds have the potential to interfere selectively with cellular protein synthesis by sequence-specific hybridization to DNA or RNA molecules. Since the gene sequence encoding TNFÎ± had been previously identified (17Pennica D. Hayflick J.S. Bringman T.S. Palladino M.A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6060-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), we predicted that specific antisense sequences could be synthesized and used to inhibit TNFÎ± expression and therefore fibrosis. To investigate this possibility, we utilized an antisense ON specific to the initiation codon of the TNFÎ± mRNA (AS-ON) and tested its effect on the macrophage cytokine gene expression. Our results indicate that AS-ON can be used to inhibit TNFÎ± expression. However, when used alone this compound is relatively ineffective, and high concentrations are required to elicit the effect. At a high concentration of 100 Î¼g/ml, AS-ON causes â¤50% inhibition of TNFÎ± production. Because high concentrations of ONs are commonly associated with nonsequence-specific effects (23Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Storey A. Oates D. Banks L. Crawford L. Crook T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4109-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), innovative approaches to improving potency of ONs are desirable. It has been reported that ONs, due to their polyanionic nature, poorly permeate cell membranes to reach their intracellular targets (31Wickstrom E.L. Bacon T.A. Gonzalez A. Freeman D.L. Lyman G.H. Wickstrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 83: 4143-4146Google Scholar, 32Juliano R.L. Akhtar S. Antisense Res. Dev. 1992; 2: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Several research groups (23Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bennett F.C.

Science. 1993; 260: 1510-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) also observed that in the absence of appropriate delivery systems ONs exhibited no antisense activity, whereas in the presence of these delivery systems, i.e. liposomes, ONs showed strong activity. These observations suggest that ONs do not normally enter the cells to a significant extent, and therefore approaches to improve their cellular uptake are important for their effective use. In agreement with previous findings, our results indicated that the cellular uptake of free ON by the AMs is very low, and this may account for the observed low activity of the AS-ON. This conclusion is supported by a dramatic and parallel increase in cellular uptake and anti-TNFÎ± activity of the AS-ON when given as a complex with the MPL. At a low concentration of AS-ON (25 Î¼g/ml), the MPL (25 Î¼g/ml) promoted a 17-fold increase in cellular uptake of the ON and caused â¥90% TNFÎ± inhibition. At this concentration level, the AS-ON alone had no significant effect on TNFÎ±. The effect of AS-ONÂ·MPL complex on TNFÎ± activity was associated with specific ablation of targeted mRNA as shown by RT-PCR. Control studies also showed that the promoting effect of MPL was not associated with loss of cell viability as determined by fluorescence propidium iodide assay. Furthermore, MPL alone or complexed with non-antisense ONs (INV-ON and S-ON) had no effect on TNFÎ± activity. Thus, these results suggested that the promoting effect of MPL was most likely due to enhanced ON uptake. To further confirm these observations and to test the mechanism of ON uptake mediated by the MPL, a series of cellular uptake experiments was conducted. Our results indicated that MPL promoted the cellular uptake of AS-ON via mannose receptor-mediated pathway since competition for mannose receptors by mannosylated BSA inhibited the uptake of the AS-ONÂ·MPL complex and the noncompetitor BSA had no effect. Furthermore, cells lacking mannose receptors (epithelial cells) or bearing few receptors (J774.1 cells) did not appreciably take up the AS-ONÂ·MPL complex. The latter results also indicated the potential targeting ability of the MPL carrier system for the AMs. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that antisense ON targeted to the TNFÎ± mRNA can be used to inhibit TNFÎ± expression in AMs. The findings in this study have a direct implication on the therapeutic utilization of ONs in pulmonary fibrosis. A similar strategy may be employed to aid the study of specific cytokine functions and their role in disease pathogenesis. Effective utilization of antisense ONs requires development of appropriate delivery systems capable of effective and selective transfer of ONs to the target cells. With regard to the AMs, we have shown that the MPL delivery system is effective and selective in promoting the cellular delivery and antisense activity of ON. The system exploits the efficient receptor-mediated endocytosis to achieve cell-specific antisense delivery. Because the system utilizes a naturally occurring cellular process, it is potentially nontoxic. Although our in vitro studies indicate the relative safety of this system, further in vivo studies are needed. Demonstration of its safety and efficacy will allow further development of this system for therapeutic purposes."

The refolding mechanism of ovalbumin was investigated under disulfide-bonded and disulfide-reduced conditions using the denatured protein state, DA, as the starting protein sample. For the preparation of DA, the disulfide-intact and disulfide-reduced forms of ovalbumin were denatured by protein incubation in 9 M urea at pH 2.2. When DA was placed in a refolding buffer, pH 8.2, an intermediate state IN was produced in either the disulfide-bonded or the disulfide-reduced condition; IN showed about 60% of the native CD ellipticity at 222 nm and the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence with the native spectrum peak but with decreased intensity. The formation of IN as detected by far UV CD ellipticity was quite rapid and finished within a mixing dead time of 20 ms. When DA was diluted with an acidic buffer, pH 2.2, a partially folded equilibrium intermediate IA with the structural characteristics equivalent to those of IN was formed. After the formations of IN and IA, the regains in CD ellipticity and tryptophan fluorescence at pH 8.2 followed biphasic kinetics in the disulfide-bonded condition but monophasic kinetics in the disulfide-reduced condition. As unexpected findings, the native disulfide in DA and IA underwent nonproductive disulfide rearrangements in the disulfide-bonded condition at an early refolding stage and then was recovered during the subsequent refolding.

In COS-1 cells, the endogenous TR, subtype Î²1 (TRÎ²1), but not subtype Î²2 or Î±1, was induced to express by okadaic acid (OA) in a concentration-dependent manner. The induced TRÎ²1 had immunoreactivity and partial V8 proteolytic maps similar to those of the transfected and in vitro translated human TRÎ²1 (h-TRÎ²1). The OA-induced expression of endogenous TRÎ²1 was, however, not observed in a variety of other cultured cell lines tested, indicating that the induction was cell type-dependent. TRÎ²1 induced by OA was a multisite phosphorylated protein, in which serine and threonine in a ratio of 10:1 were phosphorylated. The induced TRÎ²1 was functional as it could mediate the thyroid hormone-dependent transcriptional activity via several thyroid hormone response elements. The induction of endogenous TRÎ²1 expression by OA was not accompanied by an increase in mRNA levels but was the result of an increase in the stability of the TRÎ²1 protein. This is the first report to indicate that one of the mechanisms by which the TR isoforms are differentially expressed is via the tissue-specific stabilization of the TR isoform proteins.

Two TR genes, TRÎ± and TRÎ², have been identified which are located on chromosome 17 and chromosome 3, respectively. Four isoforms, Î²1, Î²2, Î±1, and Î±2, are generated from each of two TR genes, Î± and Î², by alternative splicing (1Cheng S.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1995; 2: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Oppenheimer J.H. Schwartz H.L. Strait K.A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 130: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). They are transcription factors that regulate the expression of target genes by interacting with specific DNA sequences known as thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in the promoter region of target genes (1Cheng S.Y.

The transcriptional activity of TRs is not only dependent on thyroid hormone 3,3â²,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) but also on the type of TRE.

One important but less well studied mode of modulation of TR activity is the regulation of TR expression at the protein level. TRÎ±1 and TRÎ²1 are differentially expressed at different developmental stages and at different levels in various tissues (10Rodd C. Schwartz H.L. Strait K.A. Oppenheimer J.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2559-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Strait K.A. Schwartz H.L. Perez-Castillo A. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11794-11799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, using the specific T3 binding activity and immunoreactivity as measures of the expressed receptor proteins, it was found that there are marked variations in the TR protein:mRNA ratios in different tissues (11Strait K.A. Schwartz H.L. Perez-Castillo A. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10514-10521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schwartz H.L. Strait K.A. Ling N.C. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11794-11799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting isoform- and tissue-dependent posttranslational modification of TRs. However, it is unknown how TRs could be modulated at the protein level. We studied this problem by first using the cultured rat growth hormone-producing cell line GH3, which has long been used as a model cell line for studying thyroid hormone action (13Samuels H.H. Forman B.M. Horowitz Z.D. Ye Z.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, preliminary experiments indicate that the anti-TR antibodies currently available are not sensitive enough to detect the endogenous TRs in GH3 cells either by immunoprecipitation or Western blotting. However, we subsequently discovered that in COS-1 cells, endogenous TRÎ²1 could be induced to express by okadaic acid (OA), a potent and specific inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphoprotein phosphatases 1 and 2A (14Schonthal A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells are known to be functionally deficient in TRs and have been used widely as recipient cells for gene transfer to study TR action. We therefore characterized the process of induction of TRÎ²1 by OA as we hoped to use COS-1 cells as a model cell line to understand the regulation of expression of endogenous TRs. Thus, in the present paper, we studied the molecular basis of the induction of endogenous TRÎ²1 expression and found that the OA-induced TRÎ²1 was a phosphoprotein possessing the same characteristics and functions as transfected human (h)-TRÎ²1 in mediating thyroid hormone-dependent transactivation. Moreover, the induction of endogenous TRÎ²1 protein expression was cell type-dependent in that it did not occur in GH3 (13Samuels H.H. Forman B.M. Horowitz Z.D. Ye Z.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), neuro-2Î± (16Lin K.H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The increase in TRÎ²1 protein expression by OA in COS-1 cells was not accompanied by increases in mRNA level or in the rate of synthesis of TRÎ²1 protein. Rather, our results showed that the increase in TRÎ²1 protein expression by OA was the result of increased stability of the TRÎ²1 protein most probably via phosphorylation and defined a novel role of phosphorylation in regulating the levels of TRÎ²1 in different cell types. Monkey kidney COS-1 cells (8.2 Ã 105 cells/100-mm dish) were plated. Forty-eight h later, cells were preincubated in methionine or phosphate-free medium for 90 min and incubated with 100 Î¼Ci of [35S]methionine (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) or 1 mCi (74 MBq) of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Corp.) in the presence of OA (100-250 nM) for 3 h. For phosphorylation and metabolic labeling of the transfected h-TRÎ²1, cells were transfected with 8 Î¼g of h-TRÎ²1 expression vector pCLC51 (16Lin K.H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 7737-7741Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). After labeling with either [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphate, labeled TRÎ²1 were immunoprecipitated with 5 Î¼g of monoclonal antibody (mAb) C4 (17Bhat M.K. McPhie P. Ting Y.T. Zhu X.G. Cheng S.Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10591-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or J52 (18Lin K.H. Willingham M.C. Liang C.M. Cheng S.Y. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2601-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as described by Lin et al. (16Lin K.H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 7737-7741Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Identical conditions were used for detection of endogenous TRÎ²1 in GH3, neuro-2Î±, JEG-3, A431, NIH3T3, and HeLa cell lines. Gel proteolysis of 35S-labeled TRÎ²1 was performed according to Cleveland et al. (19Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the bands containing labeled TRÎ²1 were excised and loaded into the sample wells of a 15% acrylamide gel. Three Î¼g of Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (Boehringer Mannheim) in soaking solution was overlaid. Electrophoresis was performed, and the dried gel was autoradiographed. Two-dimensional analysis of phosphoamino acids and tryptic mapping was carried out according to Ref. 20Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 145-166Google Scholar. COS-1 cells (2 Ã 106 cells/15-cm dish) were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 nM OA at 37Â°C for 3 h. Nuclei were isolated according to Samuels et al. (21Samuels H.H. Tsai J.S. Casanova J. Science. 1974; 184: 1188-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Zhao and Padmanabha (22Zhao L.J. Padmanabha R. Cell. 1988; 55: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). [125I]T3 binding was carried out as described by Samuels et al. (21Samuels H.H. Tsai J.S. Casanova J. Science. 1974; 184: 1188-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Koerner et al. (23Koerner D. Schwartz H.L. Surks M.I. Oppenheimer J.H. Jorgensen E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped in buffer H (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) with or without 100 nM OA, and cells were pelleted at 800 Ã g for 10 min at 4Â°C. Cells were lysed by passing back and forth (27 times) through a 1-ml syringe with a 25 Ã 1.56-cm needle. The lysed cell suspension was made isotonic by adding 1 ml of 0.5 M sucrose, and the nuclei were pelleted at 1,200 Ã g for 10 min. The nuclei was washed two times by resuspending in 2 ml of binding buffer B (0.32 M sucrose, 3 mM MgCl2 and 20 mM Tris, pH 7.8). The washed nuclei were incubated with 0.5 nM [125I]T3 in 200 Î¼l of binding buffer B for 30 min at 37Â°C. The binding was also carried out in the presence of 1 Î¼M unlabeled T3 to determine the nonspecific binding. At the end of the incubation, an equal volume of 1% Triton X-100 was added, and the nuclei were pelleted. The nuclei were washed further with 1 ml of binding buffer B containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and the radioactivity bound to nuclei was determined in a Î³-counter. The nuclear protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.) using aliquots of nuclei suspension. COS-1 cells (3 Ã 105/60-mm dish) were plated 1 day before transfection. The cells were transfected with 1.5 Î¼g of a reporter gene containing two copies of the palindromic TRE in tandem (pTK28m) or the chicken lysozyme TRE (pTKLys) upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to adjust the total DNA to 3 Î¼g/dish. Various concentrations of OA were added to the cells 3 h before the cells were lysed for analysis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity, which was normalized to protein concentration. Total RNA was isolated from COS-1 cells cultured in the presence or absence of 100 nM OA (RNeasy, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Fifteen Î¼g of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane, which was prehybridized at 68Â°C with QuikHyb solution (Stratagene) for 3 h, followed by hybridization at 65Â°C for 6 h with a radioactive rat TRÎ²1 cDNA probe prepared from a rat-TRÎ²1 expression plasmid (gift of Dr. R. Koenig, University of Michigan Medical Center). A human Î²-actin cDNA probe was also prepared as an internal control. The membrane was washed under stringent conditions with 0.2 Ã SSPE at 60Â°C for 10 min. The labeled filters were analyzed by exposure to x-ray film, stripped, and reprobed with the Î²-actin cDNA. 2 Î¼g of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) after treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim). 5-20 Î¼l of the resultant 100-Î¼l cDNA reaction was used for PCR to ensure linearity of response. Primers identical to sequences common to human and mouse TRÎ²1 were used to amplify a 378-base pair cDNA fragment. h-TRÎ²1 was also used as a template for PCR to serve as a control. PCR products were assessed by Southern analysis using the above rat TRÎ²1 cDNA probe. COS-1 cells were transfected with h-TRÎ²1 expression vector (pCLC51) and incubated in methionine-free medium in the presence or absence of OA. Cells were pulse labeled with 50 Î¼Ci of [35S]methionine for 30 min and chased for various time periods. Cell lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. When COS-1 cells were treated with 250 nM OA, we found that a protein band with a molecular weight identical to that of transfected h-TRÎ²1 was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-h-TRÎ²1 J52 (mAb J52; 19) (lane 8 versus lane 9 of Fig. 1A). This band was not present when the cells were not treated with OA as shown in lane 1 (Fig. 1A). As a control for specific expression of transfected h-TRÎ²1, lane 2 shows that when an identical expression plasmid lacking the coding sequence of h-TRÎ²1 was used, no expression of h-TRÎ²1 was detected. Transfection of this TRÎ²1-less vector had no effect on the induction of TRÎ²1 in COS-1 cells by OA, as the intensity of the TRÎ²1 band seen was identical to that in its absence (lane 8 versus lane 7). The intensity of the TRÎ²1 band in the presence of OA (lane 9) was slightly higher than that in the absence of OA (lane 3), reflecting the combined intensities of the endogenous and the transfected TRÎ²1. The minor lower bands in lanes 3 and 9 probably represented the degradation products. The epitope for mAb J52 is in the middle of the A/B domain (18Lin K.H. Willingham M.C. Liang C.M. Cheng S.Y. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2601-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To be certain that the band detected in lane 7 was TRÎ²1, we also used another monoclonal antibody, C4, whose epitope is located at the COOH-terminal Glu457-Val-Phe-Glu-Asp461 (17Bhat M.K. McPhie P. Ting Y.T. Zhu X.G. Cheng S.Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10591-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As shown in lane 10, a protein band with the same electrophoretic mobility as for transfected h-TRÎ²1 (lanes 12 and 6) was detected which was not seen in the absence of OA (lane 4). Lanes 13-15 are controls using an irrelevant mAb that did not immunoprecipitate TRÎ²1 to confirm the specificity of TRÎ²1 bands seen in lanes 7 and 10 To support further the conclusion that the protein induced by OA was indeed TRÎ²1, we carried out one-dimensional partial V8 protease digestion. The peptide map of the immunoprecipitated [35S]methionine-labeled TRÎ²1 derived from OA-treated cells (Fig. 1B, lane 3) was compared with the maps obtained from either transfected h-TRÎ²1 (lane 2) or in vitro translated h-TRÎ²1 (lane 4). An identical pattern of four peptides, a, b, c and d, with molecular masses of 14, 12.5, 11, and 9 kDa, respectively, was seen in lanes 2-4 The weaker band (peptide a) and the stronger band (peptide d) seen in lane 3 compared with those in lanes 2 and 4 probably were due to more extensive proteolysis of peptide a to peptide d in TRÎ²1 derived from COS-1 cells. The differences in the protease susceptibility of peptide a could reflect the differences in local aggregated charge or structure surrounding the V8 cleavage sites due to minor differences in the primary sequences of human and monkey TRÎ²1. However, a completely different protein (p58, a cytosolic thyroid hormone-binding protein; 24) yielded a completely different peptide map, as shown in lane 1 Therefore, based on the immunoreactivity and peptide mapping, we have clearly established that in COS-1 cells, OA induced the expression of TRÎ²1. mAb C4 recognizes both TRÎ²2 and TRÎ±1 because of the common conserved epitope at the COOH terminus. However, examination of lanes 10 and 11 of Fig. 1A further shows that no protein band larger or smaller than TRÎ²1 (molecular mass â¼55,000) was detected, indicating that neither TRÎ²2 (molecular mass â¼58,000) nor TRÎ±1 (molecular mass â¼47,000) was induced to express by OA. To assess whether OA could also affect the expression of TRÎ²1 in other cell types, we similarly treated the cells derived from different tissues with OA. Fig. 2A shows that no OA-induced expression of TRÎ²1 was detected in GH3, neuro-2Î±, JEG-3, A431, NIH3T3, and HeLa cells. These results indicate that the induction of the expression of TRÎ²1 was TR isoform- and cell type-dependent. We further examined the effect of the concentration of OA, ranging from 25 to 250 nM, on the induction of TRÎ²1 in COS-1 cells. Lane 2 of Fig. 2B shows that at 25 nM, no TRÎ²1 was induced. At 50 nM (lane 3), a low level of TRÎ²1 was expressed, and a maximal level of TRÎ²1 was expressed at 100 nM of OA (lane 4). A further increase in the OA concentration (250 nM) led to a fall in the expression of TRÎ²1. Previously we have shown that transfected h-TRÎ²1 is a phosphoprotein and that phosphorylation is enhanced by OA (16Lin K.H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 7737-7741Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Bhat M.K. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7927-7931Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore we asked the question of whether the induced TRÎ²1 was also a phosphoprotein. Fig. 3 shows that endogenous TRÎ²1 induced by OA was a phosphoprotein. The extent of phosphorylation was similar at 100 nM (lane 2 of Fig. 3) and 250 nM of OA (lane 3 of Fig. 3). Lane 4 is a negative control to indicate that when an irrelevant antibody was used, no phosphorylated TRÎ²1 was immunoprecipitated. However, it is important to point out that the TRÎ²1 induced at 250 nM OA was about 1/25 of that at 100 nM (see Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the extent of phosphorylation of TRÎ²1 at 250 nM would be expected to be higher than that seen for TRÎ²1 induced at 100 nM OA (lane 3 versus lane 2 of Fig. 3). These results are consistent with earlier observations that phosphorylation of transfected h-TRÎ²1 was enhanced when the OA concentration was increased from 100 to 250 nM (16Lin K.H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 7737-7741Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar to the transfected h-TRÎ²1 (16Lin K.H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 7737-7741Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), phosphorylated serine and threonine in a ratio of 10:1 were detected for the induced endogenous TRÎ²1 (data not shown). Two-dimensional tryptic mapping indicates one major phosphopeptide, corresponding to 60% of total counts, and five other minor phosphopeptides (data not shown), suggesting that multiple phosphorylation sites were present in phosphorylated TRÎ²1 induced by OA. Whether the TRÎ²1 induced by OA was functional was first assessed by T3 binding. Nuclei were isolated from COS-1 cells cultured in the presence or absence of OA and incubated with [125I]T3. As shown in Table I, the nuclei isolated from cells treated with OA had nearly 2-fold more T3 binding than those not treated with OA, indicating that OA-induced TRÎ²1 was functional as a T3 binder.Table IComparison of [125I]T3 binding to isolated nuclei of COS-1 cells cultured in medium with or without OAOASpecific [125I]T3 boundfmol/50 Î¼g nuclear proteinsâ0.34 Â± 0.06+0.58 Â± 0.07 Open table in a new tab We further examined the transcriptional activity of OA-induced endogenous TRÎ²1. Two reporter genes, one containing palindromic TRE and the other containing chicken lysozyme TRE, were transfected into cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the T3-dependent transcriptional activity of TRÎ²1 was OA-dependent. An approximately 1.8- and 2.5-fold increase in the transcriptional activity on chicken lysozyme TRE was observed at 100 and 250 nM OA, respectively. On palindromic TRE, the increase was slightly lower (â¼1.5- and 1.8-fold increase at 100 and 250 nM, respectively). These findings are similar to that observed previously of a 2-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of the transfected TRÎ²1 by OA (17Bhat M.K. McPhie P. Ting Y.T. Zhu X.G. Cheng S.Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10591-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the induced TRÎ²1 was functional, and its transcriptional activity was enhanced by phosphorylation. The induction of expression of TRÎ²1 protein by OA may occur at either the level of transcription or translation. To understand the molecular basis of the induction, we first determined the TRÎ²1 mRNA levels in cells treated with or without OA by Northern analysis. Although it was possible to detect TRÎ²1 mRNA from total RNA (Fig. 5A, lane 1) and mRNA (lane 2) prepared from control cells (GH3), no TRÎ²1 mRNA was detectable from total RNA (lanes 3 and 4) and mRNA (lanes 5 and 6) prepared from COS-1 cells in the presence (lanes 4 and 6) or absence (lanes 3 and 5) of OA. Î²-Actin mRNA was detectable in GH3 cells (lane 2 of Fig. 5B) and also in COS-1 cells either from total RNA (lanes 3 and 4 of Fig. 5B) or at a much greater abundance using the mRNA (lanes 5 and 6 of Fig. 5B), confirming the presence of intact RNA. Comparing the intensities of the Î²-actin bands in lanes 3 and 4 or 5 and 6, it can be seen that OA had no effect on the expression of Î²-actin mRNA. In light of the inability to detect TRÎ²1 mRNA in COS-1 cells by Northern analysis, we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR, and the resultant cDNA was amplified by PCR and identified by Southern analysis. In preliminary experiments, we had first titrated the amounts of RNA so that RNA used in reverse transcriptase-PCR was in the linear range, and the resultant cDNA can be compared quantitatively. Lane 1 of Fig. 5C shows that at 25 nM OA, TRÎ²1 mRNA was similar to that without OA treatment. Further increases in OA concentration led to a dose-dependent reduction of mRNA up to 100 nM, which then leveled off at 250 nM. Lanes 6-10 are controls to indicate that when no reverse transcription was carried out, no band was detected. These results indicate that OA affected the expression of endogenous TRÎ²1 at the mRNA level. Because the expression level of endogenous TRÎ²1 was virtually nondetectable under the present experimental conditions (Fig. 1A and lane 1 of Fig. 2A), it was not possible to compare the effect of OA on the expression of endogenous TRÎ²1 at the translation level. However, since we have shown that the characteristics and functions of endogenous TRÎ²1 were indistinguishable from those of transfected TRÎ²1 (see above), we used transfected TRÎ²1 to study the effect of OA on the stability of TRÎ²1. The stability of TRÎ²1 was examined by a brief pulse with [35S]methionine followed by a chase for different lengths of time in the presence (Fig. 6A, lanes 8-14) or absence of 100 nM OA (lanes 1-7). Comparison of the intensities of labeled TRÎ²1 at each time point indicates that TRÎ²1 from cultures in the presence of OA was more stable than without OA treatment. Quantitation analyses indicate that t1/2 of TRÎ²1 was â¼1.88 Â± 0.07 and 0.96 Â± 0.02 h (Fig. 6B) in the presence of OA or absence of OA, respectively, indicating that treatment of cells with OA led to a 2-fold increase in the stability of TRÎ²1. We further examined the effect of OA on the rate of synthesis of transfected TRÎ²1 by labeling cells with [35S]methionine for various lengths of time in the presence (Fig. 6C, lanes 7-12) or absence (lanes 1-6) of OA. The intensities of bands were quantified, and the rates of synthesis were calculated to be 3,546 Â± 607 and 3,402 Â± 250 counts/min for TRÎ²1 synthesized in the absence or presence of OA, respectively. These data indicate that OA had no effect on the rate of synthesis of TRÎ²1, suggesting that the increased stability of the TRÎ²1 protein was the major factor responsible for the OA induction of the TRÎ²1 protein. The mRNAs of the TR isoforms and their encoded receptor proteins are known to be expressed differentially in a tissue-specific manner. The ratios of the mRNA versus the protein levels vary widely from tissue to tissue (11Strait K.A. Schwartz H.L. Perez-Castillo A. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10514-10521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schwartz H.L. Strait K.A. Ling N.C. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11794-11799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the timing of the appearance of the various TR isoforms and the ratios of these isoforms are regulated tightly during development (10Rodd C. Schwartz H.L. Strait K.A. Oppenheimer J.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2559-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Strait K.A. Schwartz H.L. Perez-Castillo A. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10514-10521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying this tissue-specific and developmental regulation of TRs are largely unknown. In the present study we discovered that the expression of endogenous TRÎ²1 protein, but not TRÎ²2 or TRÎ±1, could be induced by OA in COS-1 cells, which are believed to be functionally deficient in response to T3. However, this induction is unique among the cell lines examined including T3 functionally competent GH3 cells (13Samuels H.H. Forman B.M. Horowitz Z.D. Ye Z.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and neuro-2Î± cells (15Lebel J.M. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 191: 2644-2648Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and T3 functionally deficient cells (JEG-3, NIH3T3, HeLa, and A431 cells). Therefore, our findings highlight a potentially novel mechanism explaining the tissue-specific expression of TR isoforms. Our data indicate that the molecular mechanisms of the induction of TRÎ²1 expression by OA were complex. The induction was mediated at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The amounts of mRNA of TRÎ²1 were reduced as the concentration of OA was increased. However, paradoxically, although OA treatment led to a reduction of mRNA, the TRÎ²1 proteins were increased by OA except at a high concentration of 250 nM. The sharp increase in the level of TRÎ²1 protein from 50 to 100 nM (Fig. 2B) was not proportional to the corresponding decrease in mRNA (Fig. 5C), reminiscent of what has been observed in the in vivo studies reported by Schwartz et al. (12Schwartz H.L. Strait K.A. Ling N.C. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11794-11799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that there are large variations in the mRNA:TR protein ratios, suggesting additional regulation at the posttranslational level. Indeed, we found that although OA had no effect on the synthesis of TRÎ²1, OA increased its stability by nearly 2-fold. Therefore, the increase in the stability of TRÎ²1 plays a major role in the function of TRs. This is the first clear report demonstrating that one of the mechanisms of the regulation of TR expression is at the posttranslational level. The reasons for the increased stability of TRÎ²1 protein by OA are not entirely clear. OA is an inhibitor of phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 and 2A and has been used widely as a tool to study the functions of phosphorylation in cellular processes (14Schonthal A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that OA not only induced TRÎ²1 expression but also increased dramatically the extent of phosphorylation. The induced TRÎ²1 was a phosphoprotein that was phosphorylated at multiple Ser and Thr sites. Although the phosphorylation sites are unknown, it is reasonable to assume that phosphorylation of Ser or/and Thr residues by the treatment of cells with OA could change the conformation of TRÎ²1, thereby decreasing its susceptibility to proteolytic degradation. Phosphorylation-induced structural modification is not without precedent. Structural changes in glycogen phosphorylase have been studied by x-ray crystallography (26Sprang S.R. Acharya K.R. Goldsmith E.J. Stuart D.I. Varvill K. Fletterick R.J. Madsen N.B. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1988; 17: 215-221Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As a result of phosphorylation of Ser-14, the interaction between subunits is strengthened, and the binding sites for allosteric effectors and substrates are altered (26Sprang S.R. Acharya K.R.

However, conformational changes are not obligatory for enhanced susceptibility of TRÎ²1 to proteolytic degradation. The increased phosphorylation of Ser or/and Thr sites could alter the interaction of TRÎ²1 with cellular proteases, thus altering the kinetics of degradation. Alteration of the stability of proteins by phosphorylation has been demonstrated directly for human IÎºB-Î± (27Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A.

Therefore the different extents of phosphorylation at different sites in TR isoforms could affect their stability differently. The present study thus raises the interesting possibility that variations in the protein stability of TRÎ²1 may be one mechanism by which the tissue-specific and development-specific expression of the TR isoforms are regulated. Although it remains to be established that the stabilities of other TR isoforms are regulated by phosphorylation, what is clear from our study is that differential phosphorylation of TR isoforms in different cell types adds yet another level of fine tuning to the already multifaceted and complex mechanisms of regulation of TR-dependent gene transcription. thyroid hormone receptor(s) 3,3â²,5-triiodo-L-thyronine human TR subtype Î²1 human TR subtype Î±1 thyroid hormone response element okadaic acid monoclonal antibody polymerase chain reaction."

ARD1 is a 64-kDa protein with an 18-kDa carboxyl-terminal ARF domain (p3) and a 46-kDa amino-terminal extension (p5) that is widely expressed in mammalian tissues. Using recombinant proteins, we showed that p5, the amino-terminal domain of ARD1, stimulates the GTPase activity of p3, the ARF domain, and appears to be the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) component of this bifunctional protein, whereas in other members of the Ras superfamily a separate GAP molecule interacts with the effector region of the GTP-binding protein. p5 stimulated the GTPase activity of p3 but not of ARF1, which differs from p3 in several amino acids in the effector domain. After substitution of 7 amino acids from p3 in the appropriate position in ARF1, the chimeric protein ARF1(39-45p3) bound to p5, which increased its GTPase activity. Specifically, after Gly40 and Thr45 in the putative effector domain of ARF1 were replaced with the equivalent Asp and Pro, respectively, from p3, functional interaction of the chimeric ARF1 with p5 was increased. Thus, Asp25 and Pro30 of the ARF domain (p3) of ARD1 are involved in its functional and physical interaction with the GTPase-activating (p5) domain of ARD1. After deletion of the amino-terminal 15 amino acids from ARF1(39-45p3), its interaction with p5 was essentially equivalent to that of p3, suggesting that the amino terminus of ARF1(39-45p3) may interfere with binding to p5. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the GAP domain of ARD1 interacts with the effector region of the ARF domain and thereby stimulates GTP hydrolysis.

Based on size, amino acid sequences, phylogenetic analysis, and gene structure, mammalian ARFs have been divided into three classes with ARF1, ARF2, and ARF3 in class I, ARF4 and ARF5 in class II, and ARF6 in class III (11Tsuchiya M. Price S.R. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2772-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARFs from these classes may function in different parts of the exocytotic and endocytotic pathways.Like Î± subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins, the smaller monomeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins are active in their GTP-bound forms and inactive when GDP is bound (12Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar). ARFs exhibit no detectable GTPase activity (13Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

U. S. A. 1996; 93: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Recently, we reported that ARD1 exhibited significant GTPase activity, whereas the ARF domain did not (23Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Addition of the 46-kDa amino-terminal domain (p5) of ARD1 (expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli) to the carboxyl-terminal ARF domain (p3) enhanced GTPase activity (23Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of the p5 domain on the GTPase activity of p3 was specific, as GTP hydrolysis by other members of the ARF family was not increased (22Ding M. Vitale N. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24005-24009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ARD1, therefore, is a novel member of the Ras superfamily of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein family, which, like the Î± subunits of the trimeric G proteins, appears to consist of two domains that contribute to its biological activity.We report here identification of a region involved in the interaction between the two domains of the protein. Using chimeric proteins and site-specific mutagenesis, we demonstrate that amino acids Asp25 and Pro30 in the ARF domain of ARD1, corresponding to amino acids 40 and 45 in the ARF proteins, appear to be crucial for both the functional and physical interaction between the two domains of ARD1. Thus, as it is in other members of the Ras superfamily, the effector domain of ARF is a site of its interaction with GAP.DISCUSSIONThe unusual GTPase activity of ARD1 has made possible the identification of a region specifically involved in both functional and physical interaction between the guanine nucleotide-binding domain (p3) and the GAP domain (p5) of ARD1. A major difference between the heterotrimeric and monomeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily is the much lower intrinsic GTPase activity of the latter. The GÎ± subunits of trimeric G proteins, as described by Bourne and colleagues (33Markby D.W. Onrust R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), contain a GTP-binding core (âRalphâ) common to the monomeric G protein family but differ by the presence of an insertion of 110-140 amino acids (âGailâ) at a position corresponding to loop 2 in p21ras. Studies of chimeric recombinant proteins (33Markby D.W. Onrust R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and crystal structure (34Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) established that this inserted domain is responsible for the GTPase activity of the GÎ± subunit. Numerous proteins that enhance the GTPase activity of members of the monomeric G proteins have now been identified (for review, see Ref. 35Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). ARF proteins lack detectable intrinsic GTPase activity (13Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and several groups have recently reported the purification or cloning of ARF GAPs (19Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10758-10763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24005-24009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).ARD1 exhibits significantly greater GTPase activity than other members of the Ras superfamily (23Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although its GTP-binding domain (p3) appeared not to possess GTPase activity, addition of the amino-terminal domain (p5) expressed as a recombinant protein promoted hydrolysis of GTP bound to p3. Amino acids Asp25 and Pro30 of the ARF domain of ARD1 (p3) were crucial for both the functional and physical interaction between the two domains of ARD1. This region is equivalent to the extended effector loop in Ras, which is known to interact with Ras-GAP and neurofibromin (36Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, based on the three-dimensional structure of ARF (37Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and computer analysis, 2Computer analysis using RasMol software. amino acids 24-30 in p3 are part of a Î² sheet that is believed to be involved in dimerization in ARF crystals (37Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Without excluding the existence of other interaction sites, it is reasonable to conclude that this region is involved in the interaction between the two domains of ARD1.Based on crystal structure and studies showing that GAPs interact with the effector domain of members of the Ras superfamily (36Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 37Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), the corresponding sequences of ARD1 and ARF1 were exchanged. Our data clearly show that replacing the LGEIVTT sequence in ARF1 with QDEFMQP (found in ARD1) conferred on it the ability to hydrolyze bound GTP in response to p5. The single replacement of Thr45 by Pro in ARF1 transformed ARF1 into a substrate for p5. We postulate that Pro creates a curve in the Î² sheet structure that might place the conserved Glu (positions 41 in ARF1 and 26 in p3) in correct position for interaction with p5. The double mutant ARF1(G40D,T45P) provided evidence that Asp influences the interaction with p5, as physical and functional interactions of the double mutant were greater than those of ARF1(T45P). p5, however, hydrolyzed GTP bound to ARF1(39-45p3) better than GTP bound to ARF1(G40D,T45P), suggesting that glutamine(s) and hydrophobic residues in this region could also be involved in the interaction with p5.The low stoichiometry of GTP binding by the ARF domain of ARD1 and by ARD1 itself is typical of recombinant ARFs (32Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 38Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Tsuchiya M. Chang P.P. Moss J. Vaughan M.

Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and may be due in part to the absence of N-myristoylation, which is a predominant determinant of the phospholipid-induced transition of ARF to the active ARF-GTP conformation (40Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29490-29494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It may also be related to the fact that among the nucleotide-binding motifs that are otherwise identical, the CAT sequence of ARFs is replaced by DAR in ARD (1Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the effect of magnesium concentration on nucleotide affinities may be questioned as the intracellular concentration is thought to be in the low millimolar range (0.1-1.0 mM), although some microenvironments with higher free metal concentrations may exist in cells. ARD guanine nucleotide exchange, like that of the ARFs (14Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 15Helms J.B. Rothman J.E.

A. 1996; 93: 12856-12860Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), may well be accelerated by a GEP.Greater GTP binding by p3 than by p8, observed with certain phospholipids (i.e. brain PC + PIP2+ PE or phosphatidylserine), may reflect differences in interactions with phospholipid vesicles due to the presence of p5. Indeed, a two-stage loading reaction (incubation first with EDTA followed by high concentrations of Mg2+) was strictly necessary for nucleotide binding to ARD1, whereas significant GTP binding to p3 could be observed without prior incubation with EDTA (data not shown). Thus, the amino-terminal p5 domain may modulate GTP binding by affecting phospholipid interactions as well as by influencing affinity for GDP. In favor of the latter possibility is the finding that deletion of 15 amino acids from the amino terminus of ARF1(39-45p3) increased GDP dissociation to a level comparable to that of p3, and the addition of p5 then reduced GDP dissociation to a level comparable to that observed with ARF1(39-45p3). These results provide evidence to add to earlier observations (27Hong J.-X. Haun R.S. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9743-9745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S. Fales H.M. Ferrige A.G. Kahn R.A. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 3056-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that the amino terminus of ARF proteins can be important in regulating nucleotide dissociation and suggest that p5 may also play this role in ARD1.The covalent attachment of a GAP-like domain to the GTPase core of an ARF protein may represent an example of exon shuffling in evolution (43Gilbert W. Nature. 1978; 271: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar) and seems related to the function of ARD1, which remains to be defined. Heterotrimeric G proteins couple activation of receptors with seven membrane-spanning helices to the regulation of ion channels and intracellular enzymes (44Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Like the GÎ± proteins, ARD1 appears to possess an intrinsic regulator of GTPase activity. However, p5 differs from the GÎ± Gail domain inserts by acting as a guanine nucleotide-dissociation inhibitor rather than a guanine nucleotide-dissociation stimulator in addition to serving as a GAP (33Markby D.W. Onrust R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, p5 acts as a negative regulator of the activity of ARD1, whereas Gail is centrally involved in both turning the GÎ± switch on (GDP release followed by GTP binding) and turning it off (GTP hydrolysis). These aspects seem likely to be important in the as yet unidentified biological function of the ARF-related protein ARD1.

Based on size, amino acid sequences, phylogenetic analysis, and gene structure, mammalian ARFs have been divided into three classes with ARF1, ARF2, and ARF3 in class I, ARF4 and ARF5 in class II, and ARF6 in class III (11Tsuchiya M.

ARFs from these classes may function in different parts of the exocytotic and endocytotic pathways.Like Î± subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins, the smaller monomeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins are active in their GTP-bound forms and inactive when GDP is bound (12Bourne H.R.

Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Addition of the 46-kDa amino-terminal domain (p5) of ARD1 (expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli) to the carboxyl-terminal ARF domain (p3) enhanced GTPase activity (23Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of the p5 domain on the GTPase activity of p3 was specific, as GTP hydrolysis by other members of the ARF family was not increased (22Ding M. Vitale N. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24005-24009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ARD1, therefore, is a novel member of the Ras superfamily of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein family, which, like the Î± subunits of the trimeric G proteins, appears to consist of two domains that contribute to its biological activity.We report here identification of a region involved in the interaction between the two domains of the protein. Using chimeric proteins and site-specific mutagenesis, we demonstrate that amino acids Asp25 and Pro30 in the ARF domain of ARD1, corresponding to amino acids 40 and 45 in the ARF proteins, appear to be crucial for both the functional and physical interaction between the two domains of ARD1. Thus, as it is in other members of the Ras superfamily, the effector domain of ARF is a site of its interaction with GAP."

In this study, we evaluated the influence of divalent cation composition and single amino acid substitutions at key positions within H3 on the selectivity of these Fab molecules for integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 versus the vitronectin receptor Î±VÎ²3. The parent Fab molecule OPG2 (H3 sequence, HPFYRYDGGN) binds selectively to Î±IIbÎ²3 and not at all to any other RGD-cognitive integrin, particularly Î±VÎ²3, under any divalent cation conditions. The binding of the AP7 Fab molecule (HPFYRGDGGN) to Î±IIbÎ²3 is not affected by the relative composition of calcium, magnesium or manganese. However, AP7 binding to Î±VÎ²3, either expressed by M21 cells or as the purified integrin, is supported by manganese and inhibited by calcium. If the flanking asparagine 108 residue within the AP7 H3 loop is replaced by alanine (HPFYRGDGGA), the resulting Fab molecule AP7.4 binds selectively to Î±VÎ²3 in a cation-dependent manner, but does not bind at all to Î±IIbÎ²3 under any conditions. AP7.4 binding to Î±VÎ²3 is supported by manganese, completely inhibited by calcium, and largely unaffected by magnesium. This behavior mimics that of the adhesive protein, osteopontin, another ligand that binds preferentially to Î±VÎ²3. Despite these differences in specificity for Î±IIbÎ²3 and Î±VÎ²3, AP7 and AP7.4 remain selective for the Î²3 integrins and do not bind to cell lines that express the RGD-cognitive integrins Î±VÎ²5 or Î±5Î²1. These results confirm that subtle changes in the amino acid composition immediately flanking the RGD or RYD motifs can have a profound effect on Î²3 integrin specificity, most likely because they influence the juxtaposition of the arginine and aspartate side chains within the extended RGD loop sequence.

Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Reactions were preincubated with peptide for 30 min at room temperature. Then 0.2 Î¼M fluorogenic substrate (Pyr-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-AMC; Peptides International) was added and reactions were incubated at 20Â°C (with LGC extract) or at 37Â°C (with purified recombinant mouse PC2 (14Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)) for 5 h. Liberated AMC was estimated at 380 nm excitation, 460 nm emission in a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer or a Cambridge Biotechnology fluorometer, respectively. Purified recombinant PC1/3 (87 kDa; 0.46 units; Ref. 18Zhou Y. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5615-5623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was tested with 1 mM to 10 Î¼M LCT2 in parallel reactions. Production of fluorescent AMC was linear between 1 and 7 h of incubation. The rate of AMC production in control reactions of LGC extracts not containing peptide was â¼125 pmol/h, and it was â¼70 pmol/h in the control reactions of LPC2 immunodepleted LGC extracts. Nonlinear regression, using the program SYSTAT, was used to determine the IC50 of enzymatic inhibition. Synthetic peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography (TANA Laboratory). LCT1 and LCT2 correspond to Leu203-Ile214 and Ser218-Leu242 of L7B2, respectively. A control peptide not related to L7B2 (Arg-Ser-Asn-Leu-Lys-Tyr-Lys-Gly-Gln-Ile-Leu-Met) was tested. Because a PC2 convertase is present in various types of peptidergic neurons in the Lymnaea brain (13Smit A.B. Spijker S. Geraerts W.P.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the activation of LPC2, like that of vertebrate PC2, requires interaction with a protein related to 7B2. Because vertebrate 7B2 proteins show a high degree of sequence identity, in principle many possibilities for the design of primers toward regions of interphylum sequence conservation exist. Therefore, a total of 10 degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to different conserved parts of the vertebrate 7B2 sequences were designed and tested with PCR amplifications in 20 different combinations of primer sets. Only by using primers OL1 and OL2 was a PCR product of the expected size found. This PCR product was cloned and sequenced, and appeared to encode a sequence similar to that of vertebrate 7B2 (data not shown). We used the PCR fragment to screen 80,000 independent clones of a cDNA library of the cerebral ganglia of L. stagnalis From 50 positive hybridization signals, the clone containing the most 5â²-extended sequence (clone L7B2) was isolated and sequenced; it comprised 1529 nucleotides. The largest open reading frame (819 nucleotides) encodes a 273-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 30.0 kDa, flanked by a 107-nucleotide 5â²-untranslated leader sequence and a 3â²-untranslated region of 603 nucleotides. The cloned L7B2 cDNA contains a poly(A) tail at the 3â² end, and a sequence (ATTAAA) that fits the consensus for poly-adenylation is present at position 1513, 17 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tract. The open reading frame is preceded by in-frame stop codons at positions â13 and â20, indicating that the coding region is complete at the 5â² end (Fig. 1). Translation of the mRNA is therefore likely to be initiated at methionine residue 1. Northern blot analysis showed a transcript of â¼1.6 kilobase pairs (data not shown), indicating that the cDNA clone is indeed full-length. The predicted L7B2 protein is organized similarly to vertebrate 7B2 (Fig. 1, Fig. 2), with a hydrophobic leader sequence, an NT domain, and a CT PC2 inhibitory domain (see below). Cleavage of the signal peptide most likely occurs after residue Ala-17 (19Von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar), providing a signal sequence that is shorter than that of vertebrate 7B2 (20Lazure C. Benjannet S. Seidah N.G. ChrÃ©tien M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1991; 38: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Sigafoos J. Chestnut W.G. Merill B.M. Taylor L.C.E. Diliberto E.R. Viveros O.H. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1993; 13: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The L7B2 protein (calculated molecular mass, 28 kDa) is considerably larger than vertebrate 7B2 (calculated molecular mass, 20.8 kDa). The 7B2 sequences characterized in vertebrates show a high amino acid sequence identity, overall ranging from 71 to 99%. The sequence alignment of L7B2 with vertebrate 7B2 (Fig. 2) reveals a remarkably low degree of amino acid sequence identity (29%) and similarity (46-48%). Nevertheless, based on the structural organization and the overall degree of sequence conservation, we conclude that cDNA clone L7B2 encodes Lymnaea 7B2. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals that in L7B2 various pairs of basic residues are present that are putative sites for endoproteolytic cleavage (7Zhou A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Lys201-Arg202, Lys208-Lys209, Lys215-Arg216, and Lys238-Lys239). Vertebrate 7B2 proteins contain three pairs of basic residues, except for salmon 7B2, which contains only two pairs, and mouse and rat 7B2, each of which contains four pairs. Three of the four pairs in L7B2 align with sites at analogous positions in vertebrate 7B2 (Fig. 2), but none are consensus sites for furin enzyme activity, a situation different from mammalian and Xenopus 7B2 but similar to salmon 7B2 (12Waldbieser G.C. Aimi J. Dixon J.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3228-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mammalian 7B2 proteins are cleaved at two sites during their transport through the secretory pathway; e.g. porcine 7B2 is cleaved after Arg150-Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg154 and after Lys171-Lys172 (numbering of 7B2 proteins refers to that used in Fig. 2A) (20Lazure C. Benjannet S. Seidah N.G. ChrÃ©tien M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1991; 38: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Sigafoos J. Chestnut W.G. Merill B.M. Taylor L.C.E. Diliberto E.R. Viveros O.H. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1993; 13: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Processing of L7B2 to NT and CT domains might occur at Lys201-Arg202, a site corresponding to the 7B2 cleavage site in Xenopus (22Ayoubi T.A.Y. van Duijnhoven H.L.P. van de Ven W.J.M. Jenks B.G. Roubos E.W. Martens G.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15644-15647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of special interest are two CT domains in L7B2, namely CT1, comprising Leu203 to Arg217, and CT2, from Ser218 to His256 (Fig. 2, B and C). The region in vertebrate 7B2 corresponding to CT2 displays a substantial degree of sequence identity with these domains, whereas the region in vertebrate 7B2 corresponding to CT1 has diverged. The vertebrate 7B2 region analogous to CT2 is indeed a potent inhibitor of PC2 enzyme activity (4Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas the NT domain containing the CT1 region fails to be active (5Van Horssen A.M. Van den Hurk W.H. Bailyes E.M. Hutton J.C. Martens G.J.M. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14292-14296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In particular, the Lys171-Lys172 pair present in the inhibitory CT2 domain is essential (5Van Horssen A.M. Van den Hurk W.H. Bailyes E.M. Hutton J.C. Martens G.J.M. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14292-14296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Zhu X. Rouille Y. Lamango N.S. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Lymnaea CT1 and CT2 domains may be internally cleaved because each contains a Lys-Lys pair (Lys208-Lys209 and Lys238-Lys239 for CT1 and CT2, respectively) (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). As shown below, both LCT1 and LCT2 inhibit LPC2 enzyme activity. The sequence identity between the NT domain of L7B2 and the vertebrate counterparts is predominantly restricted to a 10-amino acid proline-rich region (residues Pro90-Thr99, rat 7B2; Pro108-Thr117, L7B2) and several conserved scattered residues (Fig. 2). It has been suggested that the region with sequence similarity with a portion of the 60 kDa subclass of molecular chaperones (residues 1-90) might represent the region involved in PC2-7B2 interaction (2Braks J.A.M. Martens G.J.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 263-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, unlike the total NT domain and total 7B2, the vertebrate 7B2 1-90 NT domain has no influence on proPC2 maturation (3Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Also, residues 90-185 do not support the maturation of proPC2 (3Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), indicating that in addition to the strongly conserved proline-rich region (see âAddendumâ) (residues 90-99), other residues, e.g. those conserved between L7B2 and vertebrate 7B2, might be of importance for 7B2-PC2 complex formation. To test the inhibitory effect of L7B2 CT1 and CT2 on LPC2 enzyme activity, the soluble fraction of extracts of the insulin-related peptide-producing neuroendocrine LGC was used as an enriched source of LPC2. In situ hybridization on alternate sections of the Lymnaea brain revealed the cellular colocalization of LPC2 and L7B2 in the LGC of the cerebral ganglia (Fig. 3). Therefore, enzyme activity present in the LGC extract was used to hydrolyze the fluorogenic substrate Pyr-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-AMC in the presence or absence of synthetic LCT1, LCT2, and a control peptide not structurally related to L7B2. In the LGC, the furin-like convertase Lfur1 (13Smit A.B. Spijker S. Geraerts W.P.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) is expressed at low levels, whereas Lfur2 (23Smit A.B. Spijker S. Nagle G.T. Knock S.L. Kurosky A. Geraerts W.P.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) expression is not detectable. 3S. Spijker, A. B. Smit, H. E. Sharp-Baker, R. Van Elk, E. R. Van Kesteren, J. Van Minnen, and W. P. M. Geraerts, unpublished observations. In contrast to the LGC, the salivary gland is devoid of LPC2 (12Waldbieser G.C. Aimi J. Dixon J.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3228-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but expresses Lfur2 (23Smit A.B. Spijker S. Nagle G.T. Knock S.L. Kurosky A. Geraerts W.P.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and therefore it served as a control for endoprotease activity not related to LPC2. Dose-response analysis revealed that in the LGC extract, the inhibition of protease activity by LCT2 displays a biphasic character (Fig. 4A). To discriminate between the inhibition of LPC2 and of non-LPC2 activity, LPC2 was specifically removed from the cell extract by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4B). The high affinity inhibition by LCT2 was lost after LPC2 immunodepletion, whereas the remaining activity was inhibited only at a high dose (IC50 of 31 Â± 3 Î¼M). The inhibition profile on LPC2 activity was determined by subtraction of non-LPC2 activity from the activity in the LGC extract (Fig. 4C). A high affinity inhibition of LCT2 is found at 1.3 Â± 0.3 nM, which is in the same range as the IC50 of vertebrate CT on PC2 (5Van Horssen A.M. Van den Hurk W.H. Bailyes E.M. Hutton J.C. Martens G.J.M. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14292-14296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Zhu X. Rouille Y. Lamango N.S. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because LCT2 shows no inhibition toward Ca2+-dependent proteases present in the soluble fraction of the salivary gland (Fig. 4D) and because previous experiments revealed that the CT domain is not an inhibitor of PC1/3 activity (5Van Horssen A.M. Van den Hurk W.H. Bailyes E.M. Hutton J.C. Martens G.J.M. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14292-14296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the nanomolar inhibition of LCT2 very likely involves LPC2 activity, whereas the inhibition at high concentrations concerns other, as yet unidentified enzymes. Addition of 100 mM EDTA to either the LGC extract or the salivary gland extract resulted in a conversion of 10%, displaying the residual activity of Ca2+-independent proteases. Although LCT1 is much less potent than LCT2, it also shows a biphasic curve, and upon LPC2 immunodepletion from the LGC extracts, the residual activity is inhibited at 40 Â± 3 Î¼M (Fig. 4, A and B). The IC50 of LCT1 (â¼2.5 Â± 0.2 Î¼M) toward LPC2 activity was determined by subtraction of non-LPC2 activity from the activity in the LGC extract (Fig. 4C). To examine an interspecies functional conservation of the inhibitory LCT, both LCT1 and LCT2, as well as the control peptide, were tested on recombinant purified mouse PC2 and PC1/3 (14Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Zhou Y. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5615-5623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LCT2 inhibits mouse PC2 with an IC50 of 36 Â± 3 Î¼M, and the less active LCT1 inhibits mouse PC2 with an IC50 of 154 Â± 4 Î¼M), whereas mouse CT inhibits PC2 activity at 45 Â± 3 nM. PC1/3 enzyme activity is not inhibited by either of these peptides (data not shown). Thus, the LCT1 and LCT2 peptides inhibit LPC2 at low micromolar and nanomolar concentrations, respectively, whereas they inhibit mouse PC2 only at higher concentrations. This is likely due to sequence divergence and reflects the evolutionary distance between vertebrates and invertebrates (â¼600 million years). So the region that resembles the carboxyl terminus of vertebrate 7B2 most (i.e. LCT1) has the least potency with respect to the inhibition of (L)PC2 activity. This finding demonstrates that carboxyl-terminal regions of L7B2 with quite different amino acid sequences are able to inhibit the catalytic site of (L)PC2. Our results reveal that during evolution the inhibitory action of the CT domain on PC2 activity has been conserved from vertebrates to invertebrates. In a recent publication, Zhu et al. (24Zhu X. Lamango N.S. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23582-23585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggest the importance of a proline-rich region in 7B2-PC2 interaction. Interestingly, all prolines in this region are conserved in L7B2.

https://openalex.org/W1564742523,"Previously published results have revealed sequence complementarity between the 5â²-terminal regions of mRNAs for hepatic mitochondrial cytochrome P-450c27/ 25 (c27/25) and serine protease inhibitors (SPI) and predicted a role for this sequence overlap in both the regulation of c27/25 mRNA transcription and translation. The possibility that c27/25 mRNA forms an RNA duplex with complementary sequences of SPI mRNAs in vivo was demonstrated in the rat liver and COS-1 cells cotransfected with c27/25 and SPI2.1 plasmids. Quantitative evaluation of RNA duplex in COS-1 cells revealed that most of the c27/25 mRNA exists in duplex form when SPI2.1 mRNA was present at 5-10-fold that of c27/25 mRNA, a ratio comparable to that observed between these two RNAs in the liver. In cotransfected COS-1 cells with the same ratio of mRNAs, highly significant inhibition of the c27/25 mRNA translation (66-75%) was observed, while its transcription remained unaffected. The partial inhibition of c27/25 mRNA translation, even when most of it exists in duplex form, suggests that RNA duplex is undergoing some type of cytoplasmic processing to disengage c27/25 mRNA and make it available for translation. These results imply that abundant endogenous SPI RNAs are able to regulate the c27/25 gene expression."
