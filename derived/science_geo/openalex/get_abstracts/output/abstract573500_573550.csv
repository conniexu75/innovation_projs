https://openalex.org/W2552460226,"Introducing non-covalent crosslinking moieties to polymer semiconductors produces a stretchable and healable material suitable for wearable electronics. There is great interest and potential in the development of skin-inspired flexible and wearable electronic devices. Such devices require materials that twist, fold and bend with no loss in electronic—or material—properties. Zhenan Bao and colleagues report a conjugated polymer that also incorporates non-covalent interactions between adjacent chains, enabling the material to accommodate up to 100% strain whilst maintaining high charge-carrier mobility. In this proof-of-principle study the authors use the polymers to fabricate flexible and stretchable organic transistors that combine robustness with good electronic properties. Thin-film field-effect transistors are essential elements of stretchable electronic devices for wearable electronics1,2. All of the materials and components of such transistors need to be stretchable and mechanically robust3,4. Although there has been recent progress towards stretchable conductors5,6,7,8, the realization of stretchable semiconductors has focused mainly on strain-accommodating engineering of materials, or blending of nanofibres or nanowires into elastomers9,10,11. An alternative approach relies on using semiconductors that are intrinsically stretchable, so that they can be fabricated using standard processing methods12. Molecular stretchability can be enhanced when conjugated polymers, containing modified side-chains and segmented backbones, are infused with more flexible molecular building blocks13,14. Here we present a design concept for stretchable semiconducting polymers, which involves introducing chemical moieties to promote dynamic non-covalent crosslinking of the conjugated polymers. These non-covalent crosslinking moieties are able to undergo an energy dissipation mechanism through breakage of bonds when strain is applied, while retaining high charge transport abilities. As a result, our polymer is able to recover its high field-effect mobility performance (more than 1 square centimetre per volt per second) even after a hundred cycles at 100 per cent applied strain. Organic thin-film field-effect transistors fabricated from these materials exhibited mobility as high as 1.3 square centimetres per volt per second and a high on/off current ratio exceeding a million. The field-effect mobility remained as high as 1.12 square centimetres per volt per second at 100 per cent strain along the direction perpendicular to the strain. The field-effect mobility of damaged devices can be almost fully recovered after a solvent and thermal healing treatment. Finally, we successfully fabricated a skin-inspired stretchable organic transistor operating under deformations that might be expected in a wearable device."

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism for the recruitment of Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) and its accessory component, JARID2, to chromatin, which regulates methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27), during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells. The expression of MEG3 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), which could interact with JARID2, was clearly increased during transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced EMT of human lung cancer cell lines. Knockdown of MEG3 inhibited TGF-β-mediated changes in cell morphology and cell motility characteristic of EMT and counteracted TGF-β-dependent changes in the expression of EMT-related genes such as CDH1, ZEB family, and the microRNA-200 family. Overexpression of MEG3 influenced the expression of these genes and enhanced the effects of TGF-β in their expressions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that MEG3 regulated the recruitment of JARID2 and EZH2 and histone H3 methylation on the regulatory regions of CDH1 and microRNA-200 family genes for transcriptional repression. RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin isolation by RNA purification assays indicated that MEG3 could associate with JARID2 and the regulatory regions of target genes to recruit the complex. This study demonstrated a crucial role of MEG3 lncRNA in the epigenetic regulation of the EMT process in lung cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2553379312,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can initiate intracellular signaling cascades by coupling to an array of heterotrimeric G proteins and arrestin adaptor proteins. Understanding the contribution of each of these coupling options to GPCR signaling has been hampered by a paucity of tools to selectively perturb receptor function. Here we employ CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to eliminate selected G proteins (Gαq and Gα11) or arrestin2 and arrestin3 from HEK293 cells together with the elimination of receptor phosphorylation sites to define the relative contribution of G proteins, arrestins, and receptor phosphorylation to the signaling outcomes of the free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4). A lack of FFA4-mediated elevation of intracellular Ca2+ in Gαq/Gα11-null cells and agonist-mediated receptor internalization in arrestin2/3-null cells confirmed previously reported canonical signaling features of this receptor, thereby validating the genome-edited HEK293 cells. FFA4-mediated ERK1/2 activation was totally dependent on Gq/11 but intriguingly was substantially enhanced for FFA4 receptors lacking sites of regulated phosphorylation. This was not due to a simple lack of desensitization of Gq/11 signaling because the Gq/11-dependent calcium response was desensitized by both receptor phosphorylation and arrestin-dependent mechanisms, whereas a substantially enhanced ERK1/2 response was only observed for receptors lacking phosphorylation sites and not in arrestin2/3-null cells. In conclusion, we validate CRISPR/Cas9 engineered HEK293 cells lacking Gq/11 or arrestin2/3 as systems for GPCR signaling research and employ these cells to reveal a previously unappreciated interplay of signaling pathways where receptor phosphorylation can impact on ERK1/2 signaling through a mechanism that is likely independent of arrestins."

https://openalex.org/W2550919794,"Multiple emotion regulation strategies have been identified and found to differ in their effectiveness at decreasing negative emotions. One reason for this might be that individual strategies are associated with differing levels of cognitive demand and require distinct patterns of visual attention to achieve their effects. In the current study, we tested this hypothesis in a sample of psychiatrically healthy participants (n = 25) who attempted to down-regulate negative emotion to photographs from the International Affective Picture System using cognitive reappraisal or distraction. Eye movements, pupil dilation, and subjective reports of negative emotionality were obtained for reappraisal, distraction, unpleasant passive viewing, and neutral passive viewing conditions. Behavioral results indicated that reappraisal and distraction successfully decreased self-reported negative affect relative to unpleasant passive viewing. Successful down regulation of negative affect was associated with different patterns of visual attention across regulation strategies. During reappraisal, there was an initial increase in dwell time to arousing scene regions and a subsequent shift away from these regions during later portions of the trial, whereas distraction was associated with reduced total dwell time to arousing interest areas throughout the entire stimulus presentation. Pupil dilation was greater for reappraisal than distraction or unpleasant passive viewing, suggesting that reappraisal may recruit more effortful cognitive control processes. Furthermore, greater decreases in self-reported negative emotion were associated with a lower proportion of dwell time within arousing areas of interest. These findings suggest that different emotion regulation strategies necessitate different patterns of visual attention to be effective and that individual differences in visual attention predict the extent to which individuals can successfully decrease negative emotion using reappraisal and distraction."
https://openalex.org/W2553852917,"The whitefly Bemisia tabaci sibling species (sibsp.) group comprises morphologically indiscernible lineages of well-known exemplars referred to as biotypes. It is distributed throughout tropical and subtropical latitudes and includes the contemporary invasive haplotypes, termed B and Q. Several well-studied B. tabaci biotypes exhibit ecological and biological diversity, however, most members are poorly studied or completely uncharacterized. Genetic studies have revealed substantial diversity within the group based on a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) sequence (haplotypes), with other tested markers being less useful for deep phylogenetic comparisons. The view of global relationships within the B. tabaci sibsp. group is largely derived from this single marker, making assessment of gene flow and genetic structure difficult at the population level. Here, the population structure was explored for B. tabaci in a global context using nuclear data from variable microsatellite markers. Worldwide collections were examined representing most of the available diversity, including known monophagous, polyphagous, invasive, and indigenous haplotypes. Well-characterized biotypes and other related geographic lineages discovered represented highly differentiated genetic clusters with little or no evidence of gene flow. The invasive B and Q biotypes exhibited moderate to high levels of genetic diversity, suggesting that they stemmed from large founding populations that have maintained ancestral variation, despite homogenizing effects, possibly due to human-mediated among-population gene flow. Results of the microsatellite analyses are in general agreement with published mtCOI phylogenies; however, notable conflicts exist between the nuclear and mitochondrial relationships, highlighting the need for a multifaceted approach to delineate the evolutionary history of the group. This study supports the hypothesis that the extant B. tabaci sibsp. group contains ancient genetic entities and highlights the vast cryptic diversity throughout the genome in the group."
https://openalex.org/W2483554280,"The development of automated servers to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins has seen much progress over the years. These servers make calculations simpler, but largely exclude users from the process. In this study, we present the PRotein Interactive MOdeling (PRIMO) pipeline for homology modeling of protein monomers. The pipeline eases the multi-step modeling process, and reduces the workload required by the user, while still allowing engagement from the user during every step. Default parameters are given for each step, which can either be modified or supplemented with additional external input. PRIMO has been designed for users of varying levels of experience with homology modeling. The pipeline incorporates a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to alter parameters used during modeling. During each stage of the modeling process, the site provides suggestions for novice users to improve the quality of their models. PRIMO provides functionality that allows users to also model ligands and ions in complex with their protein targets. Herein, we assess the accuracy of the fully automated capabilities of the server, including a comparative analysis of the available alignment programs, as well as of the refinement levels used during modeling. The tests presented here demonstrate the reliability of the PRIMO server when producing a large number of protein models. While PRIMO does focus on user involvement in the homology modeling process, the results indicate that in the presence of suitable templates, good quality models can be produced even without user intervention. This gives an idea of the base level accuracy of PRIMO, which users can improve upon by adjusting parameters in their modeling runs. The accuracy of PRIMO’s automated scripts is being continuously evaluated by the CAMEO (Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn) project. The PRIMO site is free for non-commercial use and can be accessed at https://primo.rubi.ru.ac.za/."
https://openalex.org/W2552468431,"In plants, the NAC (NAM-ATAF1/2-CUC) family of proteins constitutes several transcription factors and plays vital roles in diverse biological processes, such as growth, development, and adaption to adverse factors. Tea, as a non-alcoholic drink, is known for its bioactive ingredients and health efficacy. Currently, knowledge about NAC gene family in tea plant remains very limited. In this study, a total of 45 CsNAC genes encoding NAC proteins including three membrane-bound members were identified in tea plant through transcriptome analysis. CsNAC factors and Arabidopsis counterparts were clustered into 17 subgroups after phylogenetic analysis. Conserved motif analysis revealed that CsNAC proteins with a close evolutionary relationship possessed uniform or similar motif compositions. The distribution of NAC family MTFs (membrane-associated transcription factors) among higher plants of whose genome-wide has been completed revealed that the existence of doubled TMs (transmembrane motifs) may be specific to fabids. Transcriptome analysis exhibited the expression profiles of CsNAC genes in different tea plant cultivars under non-stress conditions. Nine CsNAC genes, including the predicted stress-related and membrane-bound genes, were examined through qRT-PCR (quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction) in two tea plant cultivars, namely, 'Huangjinya' and 'Yingshuang'. The expression patterns of these genes were investigated in different tissues (root, stem, mature leaf, young leaf and bud) and under diverse environmental stresses (drought, salt, heat, cold and abscisic acid). Several CsNAC genes, including CsNAC17 and CsNAC30 that are highly orthologous to known stress-responsive ANAC072/RD26 were identified as highly responsive to abiotic stress. This study provides a global survey of tea plant NAC proteins, and would be helpful for the improvement of stress resistance in tea plant via genetic engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2549874827,"RATIONALE Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia and infectious death in adults worldwide. A non-human primate model is needed to study the molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of severe pneumonia, identify diagnostic tools, explore potential therapeutic targets, and test clinical interventions during pneumococcal pneumonia. OBJECTIVE To develop a non-human primate model of pneumococcal pneumonia. METHODS Seven adult baboons (Papio cynocephalus) were surgically tethered to a continuous monitoring system that recorded heart rate, temperature, and electrocardiography. Animals were inoculated with 109 colony-forming units of S. pneumoniae using bronchoscopy. Three baboons were rescued with intravenous ampicillin therapy. Pneumonia was diagnosed using lung ultrasonography and ex vivo confirmation by histopathology and immunodetection of pneumococcal capsule. Organ failure, using serum biomarkers and quantification of bacteremia, was assessed daily. RESULTS Challenged animals developed signs and symptoms of pneumonia 4 days after infection. Infection was characterized by the presence of cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, tachycardia and fever. All animals developed leukocytosis and bacteremia 24 hours after infection. A severe inflammatory reaction was detected by elevation of serum cytokines, including Interleukin (IL)1Ra, IL-6, and IL-8, after infection. Lung ultrasonography precisely detected the lobes with pneumonia that were later confirmed by pathological analysis. Lung pathology positively correlated with disease severity. Antimicrobial therapy rapidly reversed symptomology and reduced serum cytokines. CONCLUSIONS We have developed a novel animal model for severe pneumococcal pneumonia that mimics the clinical presentation, inflammatory response, and infection kinetics seen in humans. This is a novel model to test vaccines and treatments, measure biomarkers to diagnose pneumonia, and predict outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2550153225,"Over 234,000 rats were used in regulated procedures in the UK in 2014, many of which may have resulted in some degree of pain. When using animals in research, there is an ethical and legal responsibility to alleviate or at least reduce pain to an absolute minimum. To do this, we must be able to effectively assess pain in an accurate and timely manner. The Rat Grimace Scale (RGS) is a pain assessment tool, which is suggested to be both accurate and rapid in pain assessment. Many procedures involve the use of general anaesthesia. To date, the effects of anaesthesia on the RGS have not been assessed, limiting its potential utility for assessing pain following anaesthesia. Forty-eight Lister hooded rats were used in this study (24 in part A and 24 in a separate part B). Rats were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups in part A; short duration isoflurane exposure, short duration control exposure (air) and one of two treatment groups in part B; surgical duration isoflurane exposure or surgical duration control exposure (oxygen). Rats were placed into an anaesthetic induction chamber and isoflurane, or control gas piped into the chamber for either 4 (short duration exposure) or 12 minutes (surgical duration exposure). Following recovery, photographs of the rats’ faces were taken and then scored blindly using the RGS. Short duration isoflurane anaesthesia had no effect on RGS scores. However, when rats are anaesthetised for a longer duration, akin to a simple routine surgical procedure, the RGS score increases significantly and this increase remains on repeated exposure to this duration of anaesthesia over a 4-day period. This should be accounted for when using the RGS to assess pain in rats in the immediate time period following procedures involving the use of isoflurane anaesthesia."

They exhibit structural homology and activate VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, receptors on endothelial cells that signal for growth of blood vessels and lymphatics. VEGF-C and VEGF-D were thought to exhibit similar bioactivities, yet recent studies indicated distinct signaling mechanisms (e.g. tumor-derived VEGF-C promoted expression of the prostaglandin biosynthetic enzyme COX-2 in lymphatics, a response thought to facilitate metastasis via the lymphatic vasculature, whereas VEGF-D did not). Here we explore the basis of the distinct bioactivities of VEGF-D using a neutralizing antibody, peptide mapping, and mutagenesis to demonstrate that the N-terminal α-helix of mature VEGF-D (Phe93–Arg108) is critical for binding VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. Importantly, the N-terminal part of this α-helix, from Phe93 to Thr98, is required for binding VEGFR-3 but not VEGFR-2. Surprisingly, the corresponding part of the α-helix in mature VEGF-C did not influence binding to either VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3, indicating distinct determinants of receptor binding by these growth factors. A variant of mature VEGF-D harboring a mutation in the N-terminal α-helix, D103A, exhibited enhanced potency for activating VEGFR-3, was able to promote increased COX-2 mRNA levels in lymphatic endothelial cells, and had enhanced capacity to induce lymphatic sprouting in vivo.

Broadly, VEGF-C and VEGF-D are thought to exhibit similar receptor-binding specificities and biological activities. However, recent findings suggested that there may be differences in the structure/function relationships for these two growth factors. For example, it has been reported that the choice of the N-terminal processing site for the production of mature VEGF-D can profoundly influence receptor specificity (32.Leppänen V.M. Jeltsch M. Anisimov A. Tvorogov D. Aho K. Kalkkinen N. Toivanen P. Ylä-Herttuala S. Ballmer-Hofer K. Alitalo K. Structural determinants of vascular endothelial growth factor-D receptor binding and specificity.Blood. 2011; 117: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas there has been no such report for VEGF-C. Further, studies in mouse models of cancer showed that VEGF-C produced by tumor cells promoted expression of COX-2 (an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins) in the endothelial cells of collecting lymphatic vessels, whereas VEGF-D did not, indicating that these growth factors may exhibit distinct regulatory mechanisms for promoting metastasis via the lymphatic vasculature (5.Karnezis T. Shayan R. Caesar C. Roufail S. Harris N.C. Ardipradja K. Zhang Y.F. Williams S.P. Farnsworth R.H. Chai M.G. Rupasinghe T.W. Tull D.L. Baldwin M.E. Sloan E.K. Fox S.B. Achen M.G. Stacker S.A. VEGF-D promotes tumor metastasis by regulating prostaglandins produced by the collecting lymphatic endothelium.Cancer Cell. 2012; 21: 181-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Differences in the functions of VEGF-C and VEGF-D are important from the perspective of cancer biology, given that these growth factors can exhibit distinct patterns of expression in human tumors (8.Stacker S.A.

The role of tumor lymphangiogenesis in metastatic spread.FASEB J. 2002; 16: 922-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). For example, VEGF-C has been reported to be up-regulated in head and neck cancer versus normal epithelium, whereas VEGF-D expression is down-regulated (34.O-charoenrat P. Rhys-Evans P. Eccles S.A. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family members in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma correlates with lymph node metastasis.Cancer. 2001; 92: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar); conversely, VEGF-D, but not VEGF-C, was reported to be an independent predictor of poor outcome in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (35.Yokoyama Y. Charnock-Jones D.S. Licence D. Yanaihara A. Hastings J.M. Holland C.M. Emoto M. Umemoto M. Sakamoto T. Sato S. Mizunuma H. Smith S.K. Vascular endothelial growth factor-D is an independent prognostic factor in epithelial ovarian carcinoma.Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 88: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of mature human VEGF-C bound to portions of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 have been reported (36.Leppänen V.M. Prota A.E. Jeltsch M. Anisimov A. Kalkkinen N. Strandin T. Lankinen H.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 12960-12965Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of a variant of mature human VEGF-D (VEGF-D C117A) has been determined (32.Leppänen V.M. Jeltsch M. Anisimov A. Tvorogov D. Aho K. Kalkkinen N. Toivanen P. Ylä-Herttuala S. Ballmer-Hofer K. Alitalo K. Structural determinants of vascular endothelial growth factor-D receptor binding and specificity.Blood. 2011; 117: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, there have been no reports of structures for VEGF-D in complex with either VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3, so the structural determinants important for the interaction of VEGF-D with its receptors remain to be fully characterized. Here we identify amino acid residues in the N-terminal α-helix of mature VEGF-D that are critical for receptor binding and the bioactivities of this protein. We show that the comparable region of VEGF-C is not a key determinant of receptor binding, which indicates divergent mechanisms for receptor interactions in VEGF-C versus VEGF-D. Our findings have potential clinical significance for developing monoclonal antibodies to block VEGF-D in cancer and for optimizing protein growth factors to promote therapeutic lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic remodeling to treat lymphedema and inflammatory conditions. We previously employed a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) to mature human VEGF-D, designated VD1, to identify part of the binding site in VEGF-D for VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. The region thus identified, 147NEESL151, was located in the L2 loop on the pole of the VEGF-D monomer (38.Davydova N. Roufail S. Streltsov V.A. Stacker S.A. Achen M.G. The VD1 neutralizing antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor-D: binding epitope and relationship to receptor binding.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 407: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To identify other regions of VEGF-D critical for receptor interactions and the distinct biological activities of this growth factor, we assessed a panel of commercially available and in-house VEGF-D mAbs for neutralizing capacity in bioassays of binding and cross-linking of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. These assays employed cell lines expressing chimeric receptors consisting of the entire extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 and the trans-membrane and cytoplasmic domains of the mouse erythropoietin receptor (25.Stacker S.A. Stenvers K. Caesar C. Vitali A. Domagala T. Nice E. Roufail S. Simpson R.J. Moritz R. Karpanen T. Alitalo K. Achen M.G. Biosynthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor-D involves proteolytic processing which generates non-covalent homodimers.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32127-32136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Binding and cross-linking of the chimeric receptors allows these cells to survive and proliferate in the absence of interleukin-3 (IL-3). This analysis demonstrated that the commercially available mAb 286 blocks binding and cross-linking of both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 by a form of mature human VEGF-D previously designated VEGF-DΔNΔC (22.Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) is a ligand for the tyrosine kinases VEGF receptor 2 (Flk1) and VEGF receptor 3 (Flt4).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The neutralizing VD1 mAb was included as a positive control, which blocked binding and cross-linking of both receptors by VEGF-DΔNΔC, as reported previously (39.Achen M.G. Roufail S. Domagala T. Catimel B. Nice E.C. Geleick D.M. Murphy R. Scott A.M. Caesar C. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Monoclonal antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor-D block its interactions with both VEGF receptor-2 and VEGF receptor-3.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The VD4 mAb, which binds VEGF-DΔNΔC but does not block the interactions of this ligand with VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3, was also included and had no effect on receptor binding and cross-linking in the bioassays, as expected (39.Achen M.G. Roufail S. Domagala T. Catimel B. Nice E.C. Geleick D.M. Murphy R. Scott A.M. Caesar C. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Monoclonal antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor-D block its interactions with both VEGF receptor-2 and VEGF receptor-3.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We mapped the binding site of mAb 286 by ELISA using a synthetic peptide library covering the amino acid sequence of VEGF-DΔNΔC (Fig. 1B). Positive signals were detected for interactions of mAb 286 with three peptides that had the sequence 95DIETLKVID103 in common. This sequence is located near the N terminus of VEGF-DΔNΔC and lies in the N-terminal α-helix of mature VEGF-D (32.Leppänen V.M. Jeltsch M. Anisimov A. Tvorogov D. Aho K. Kalkkinen N. Toivanen P. Ylä-Herttuala S. Ballmer-Hofer K. Alitalo K. Structural determinants of vascular endothelial growth factor-D receptor binding and specificity.Blood. 2011; 117: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To confirm these findings, we generated mutants of VEGF-DΔNΔC with each residue in the 95DIETLKVID103 region individually converted to alanine. The interaction of these mutants with mAb 286 was monitored by Western blotting and ELISA, which demonstrated that various residues in this region are important for binding this mAb. For example, mutation of either Asp95 or Thr98 to alanine completely abrogated binding to mAb 286, as assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C), and almost completely abrogated binding in the ELISA (Fig. 1D). Mutation of Glu97, Leu99, Lys100, or Asp103 to alanine reduced binding to mAb 286, as assessed by both methods, but not to the same degree as Asp95 or Thr98. These findings confirm the importance of the 95DIETLKVID103 region in the N-terminal α-helix of mature VEGF-D for the interaction with mAb 286. Our results also show that targeting this region of mature VEGF-D with a mAb can prevent this growth factor from binding and cross-linking VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. The data presented above indicate that mAb 286 blocks the interactions of VEGF-D with VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 by binding to the N-terminal α-helix of mature VEGF-D. However, it was not known whether this mAb binds the same or overlapping sites on VEGF-D as these receptors or if binding occurs at distinct sites and the neutralizing effect of the mAb is due to steric hindrance. To explore the importance of specific amino acid residues in the N-terminal α-helix of mature human VEGF-D for receptor binding and activation, we studied VEGF-D mutants in which each residue from position 93 to 108 had been individually altered to alanine (see Fig. 2A for locations of these residues). We tested binding of VEGF-DΔNΔC variants to both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 in receptor-binding ELISAs and in bioassays of receptor binding and cross-linking. These data showed that alteration to alanine of each of the residues from Phe93 to Thr98 (i.e. the first six residues of the structure shown in Fig. 2A) had no effect on the interaction with VEGFR-2 (Fig. 2, B and C, left panels), whereas for VEGFR-3, alteration of Tyr94 to alanine led to a dramatic decrease of receptor binding and cross-linking (Fig. 2, B and C, right panels). Similar loss of VEGFR-3 binding and cross-linking was seen with the L99A mutant, and this mutant also exhibited decreased binding and cross-linking of VEGFR-2. Likewise, alteration of residues C-terminal to Leu99 that reduced VEGFR-3 binding and cross-linking (e.g. I102A, E105A, and W106A) also reduced binding and cross-linking of VEGFR-2. Interestingly, the D103A mutant exhibited enhanced binding and cross-linking of VEGFR-3, but not VEGFR-2, compared with VEGF-DΔNΔC. We also analyzed the capacity of selected VEGF-D mutants to activate VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 on human adult lymphatic endothelial cells (AdLECs) by monitoring tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptors (Fig. 2D). The results were consistent with the ELISAs and bioassays (i.e. Y94A promoted phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, but not VEGFR-3, whereas L99A, I102A, E105A, and W106A were unable to promote pronounced phosphorylation of either receptor). The VEGF-DΔNΔC variants studied above had been tagged at the N terminus with the FLAG octapeptide, in relatively close proximity to the N-terminal α-helix, to facilitate purification and quantitation. To confirm that the effects on receptor binding and activation that we observed were not influenced by the FLAG tag, we analyzed the Y94A, K100A, and I102A mutations in the setting of an altered form of VEGF-DΔNΔC that lacked the FLAG tag. Analysis of these mutants in bioassays and receptor phosphorylation assays showed the same profile of receptor binding, cross-linking, and activation as for the corresponding FLAG-tagged mutants (Fig. 3). These findings indicate that the FLAG tag in the VEGF-DΔNΔC variants did not influence the results of our receptor interaction studies. The data described above demonstrate that residues in the N-terminal α-helix of mature human VEGF-D are critical for binding VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 as well as mAb 286. Hence, this mAb interacts with a region of VEGF-D that overlaps part of the binding sites for these receptors. The data also suggest that the N-terminal portion of this α-helix (i.e. from Phe93 to Thr98) is more important for the binding of VEGF-D to VEGFR-3 than to VEGFR-2. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal α-helices in mature human VEGF-C and VEGF-D indicates a high degree of homology between these regions with multiple residues that are important for the interaction of VEGF-D with VEGFR-2 and/or VEGFR-3 being conserved in VEGF-C (i.e. Tyr94, Leu99, Ile102, Glu105, and Trp106 (Fig. 4A). To compare the role of the α-helices in receptor binding, we generated a series of mutants of VEGF-CΔNΔC and VEGF-DΔNΔC in which different parts of these regions were converted to alanine residues (these mutants are defined in Fig. 4A). These mutants were tested for their ability to activate VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 by monitoring tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptors. Mutation to alanine of all six residues N-terminal to Leu99 (designated 6Ala) in VEGF-DΔNΔC did not alter the capacity to promote tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 (Fig. 4B, left). However, additional alteration of either Leu99 (7Ala) or both Leu99 and Lys100 (8Ala) to alanine prevented VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. Notably, exchange of only Phe93, Tyr94, and Asp95 to alanine (3Ala) in VEGF-DΔNΔC was sufficient to prevent phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 (Fig. 4B, right). In contrast, for VEGF-CΔNΔC, alanine exchange of the three, five, six, seven, or eight residues N-terminal to Ser121 (3Ala, 5Ala, 6Ala, 7Ala, or 8Ala, respectively) did not have any pronounced effect on phosphorylation of either VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 (Fig. 4C). Likewise, a mutant of VEGF-CΔNΔC in which residues 113–121 had been deleted (designated Δ9) induced phosphorylation on tyrosine of both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, as did two mutants lacking residues 113–115 or 113–118 (designated Δ3 and Δ6, respectively) (Fig. 4D). These three mutants also promoted binding and cross-linking of the extracellular domains of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, as assessed in bioassays (Fig. 4D). Our studies of receptor phosphorylation shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the N-terminal region of mature VEGF-D, from residue Phe93 to Thr98, is critical for the activation of VEGFR-3 but not VEGFR-2. Surprisingly, residues in the homologous region of VEGF-C (i.e. from His113 to Lys120) are not critical for the activation of either VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 by this ligand. The variants of mature human VEGF-D described above provided the opportunity to assess the importance of residues in the N-terminal α-helix for the biological activities of this growth factor. Furthermore, given that these variants exhibited distinct receptor-binding specificities, they could also be used to assess the role of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 in the bioactivities of VEGF-D. We focused on the proliferation and migration of LECs because these processes are required for the remodeling of lymphatics in cancer, which in turn promotes metastatic spread via the lymphatic vasculature (1.Stacker S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2556055680,"Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are considered an emerging technology in the industrial and educational fields. This technology is essential in the deployment of the intelligent transportation system, which is targeted to improve safety and efficiency of traffic. The implementation of VANETs can be effectively executed by transmitting data among vehicles with the use of multiple hops. However, the intrinsic characteristics of VANETs, such as its dynamic network topology and intermittent connectivity, limit data delivery. One particular challenge of this network is the possibility that the contributing node may only remain in the network for a limited time. Hence, to prevent data loss from that node, the information must reach the destination node via multi-hop routing techniques. An appropriate, efficient, and stable routing algorithm must be developed for various VANET applications to address the issues of dynamic topology and intermittent connectivity. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel routing algorithm called efficient and stable routing algorithm based on user mobility and node density (ESRA-MD). The proposed algorithm can adapt to significant changes that may occur in the urban vehicular environment. This algorithm works by selecting an optimal route on the basis of hop count and link duration for delivering data from source to destination, thereby satisfying various quality of service considerations. The validity of the proposed algorithm is investigated by its comparison with ARP-QD protocol, which works on the mechanism of optimal route finding in VANETs in urban environments. Simulation results reveal that the proposed ESRA-MD algorithm shows remarkable improvement in terms of delivery ratio, delivery delay, and communication overhead."
https://openalex.org/W2549474797,"The existence of multipotent adipose-derived stem cells isolated from human orbital fat (OF) tissue has shown great therapeutic potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. But the use of stem cells for therapeutic applications is influenced by their proliferative and differentiation potentials, which may be affected by the age of the donor. So far there is little knowledge about the effects of donor age on the biological properties of human orbital adipose-derived stem cells (OASCs). The intraorbital fat protrusion in the lower eyelids occurs as an aging process, and the protruded fat is routinely removed during aesthetic surgeries. Based on the ease of OF harvest and the availability of OASCs, we investigated in this study the relationship between age and the differentiation and proliferation potentials of human OASCs. Human orbital adipose samples were harvested from young (with normal lower eyelid appearance) and old donors (having protruded fat pads in the lower eyelids). The morphological properties of orbital adipocytes were assessed and the fat cell size displayed a decreasing trend with advancing age. OASCs were isolated from the fat samples, expanded in vitro and cultured under appropriate inducive conditions. Compared to the young cells, although no difference was found in the cell yield and phenotype expression, aged OASCs showed fewer progenitor cell numbers, reduced proliferative rates, increased senescent features and decreased differentiation potentials towards adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. Our data suggested that using autologous OASCs from elderly patients for potential therapeutic purposes might be restricted."
https://openalex.org/W2551912255,"Neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have increased over the last few decades. These neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by a complex etiology, which involves multiple genes and gene-environmental interactions. Various genes that control specific properties of neural development exert pivotal roles in the occurrence and severity of phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, paternal aging has been reported as one of the factors that contribute to the risk of ASD and ADHD. Here we report, for the first time, that paternal aging has profound effects on the onset of behavioral abnormalities in mice carrying a mutation of Pax6, a gene with neurodevelopmental regulatory functions. We adopted an in vitro fertilization approach to restrict the influence of additional factors. Comprehensive behavioral analyses were performed in Sey/+ mice (i.e., Pax6 mutant heterozygotes) born from in vitro fertilization of sperm taken from young or aged Sey/+ fathers. No body weight changes were found in the four groups, i.e., Sey/+ and wild type (WT) mice born to young or aged father. However, we found important differences in maternal separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations of Sey/+ mice born from young father and in the level of hyperactivity of Sey/+ mice born from aged fathers in the open-field test, respectively, compared to WT littermates. Phenotypes of anxiety were observed in both genotypes born from aged fathers compared with those born from young fathers. No significant difference was found in social behavior and sensorimotor gating among the four groups. These results indicate that mice with a single genetic risk factor can develop different phenotypes depending on the paternal age. Our study advocates for serious considerations on the role of paternal aging in breeding strategies for animal studies."
https://openalex.org/W2553081050,"Introduction Adolescent childbearing remains a major challenge to improving neonatal mortality especially in Sub Saharan countries which are still struggling with high neonatal mortality rates. We explored essential newborn care practices and associated factors among adolescent mothers in Western Uganda. Methods Data were collected among 410 adolescent mothers with children aged one to six months in Hoima district. Three composite variables (appropriate neonatal breastfeeding, cord care and thermal protection) were derived by combining related practices from a list of recommended newborn care practices. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors independently associated with practice of essential newborn care. Results Appropriate newborn feeding, optimal thermal protection and dry cord care were practiced by 60.5%, 67.2% and 31% of adolescent mothers respectively. Independent predictors’ of cord care were: knowledge of cord care (AOR 5.34, 95% CI (1.51–18.84) and having delivered twins (AOR 0.04, 95% CI (0.01–0.22). The only predictor of thermal care was knowledge (AOR 25.15, 95% CI (7.01–90.20). Staying in a hospital for more than one day postpartum (AOR 2.45, 95%CI (1.23–4.86), knowledge of the correct time of breastfeeding initiation (AOR 14.71, 95% CI (5.20–41.58), predicted appropriate neonatal feeding, whereas; adolescent mothers who had had a caesarean delivery (AOR 0.19, 95% CI (I 0.04–0.96) and a male caretaker in the postnatal period (AOR 0.18, 95% CI (0.07–0.49) were less likely to practice the recommended newborn feeding. Conclusion Sub optimal essential newborn care practice was noted especially suboptimal cord care. Adolescent mothers should be a focus of strategies to improve maternal and neonatal health."

https://openalex.org/W2555994234,"Echinoderms are prone to large population fluctuations that can be mediated by pervasive disease events. For the majority of echinoderm disease events the causative pathogen is unknown. Viruses have only recently been explored as potential pathogens using culture-independent techniques though little information currently exists on echinoderm viruses. In this study, ten circular ssDNA viruses were discovered in tissues among an asteroid (Asterias forbesi), an echinoid (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) and a holothurian (Parastichopus californicus) using viral metagenomics. Genome architecture and sequence similarity place these viruses among the rapidly expanding circular rep-encoding single stranded (CRESS) DNA viral group. Multiple genomes from the same tissue were no more similar in sequence identity to each other than when compared to other known CRESS DNA viruses. The results from this study are the first to describe a virus from a holothurian and continue to show the ubiquity of these viruses among aquatic invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2556352110,"Rapid fragmentation and degradation of large undisturbed habitats constitute major threats to biodiversity. Several studies have shown that populations in small and highly isolated habitat patches are prone to strong environmental and demographic stochasticity and increased risk of extinction. Based on community assembly theory, we predict recent rapid forest fragmentation to cause a decline in species and functional guild richness of forest birds combined with a high species turnover among habitat patches, and well defined dominance structures, if competition is the major driver of community assembly. To test these predictions, we analysed species co-occurrence, nestedness, and competitive strength to infer effects of interspecific competition, habitat structure, and species′ traits on the assembly of bird species communities from 12 cloud forest fragments in southern Kenya. Our results do not point to a single ecological driver of variation in species composition. Interspecific competition does not appear to be a major driver of species segregation in small forest patches, while its relative importance appears to be higher in larger ones, which may be indicative for a generic shift from competition-dominated to colonisation-driven community structure with decreasing fragment size. Functional trait diversity was independent of fragment size after controlling for species richness. As fragmentation effects vary among feeding guilds and habitat generalists, in particular, tend to decline in low quality forest patches, we plead for taking species ecology fully into account when predicting tropical community responses to habitat change."

However, the mechanism underlying the effects of hypoxia on MSCs remains to be elucidated. This study attempted to uncover the signaling pathway of MSC proliferation. Under low-oxygen culture conditions, MSCs maintained their proliferation and differentiation abilities for a long term. The Notch2 receptor was up-regulated in MSCs under hypoxic conditions. Notch2-knockdown (Notch2-KD) MSCs lost their cellular proliferation ability and showed reduced gene expression of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF)-1α, HIF-2α, and c-Myc. Overexpression of the c-Myc gene in Notch2-KD MSCs allowed the cells to regain their proliferation capacity. These results suggested that Notch2 signaling is linked to c-Myc expression and plays a key role in the regulation of MSC proliferation. Our findings provide important knowledge for elucidating the self-replication competence of MSCs in the bone marrow microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2549387534,"Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bovine intramammary infections (IMIs) that can evolve into difficult-to-treat chronic mastitis. To date, no vaccine formulation has shown high protective efficacy against S. aureus IMI, partly because this bacterium can efficiently evade the immune system. For instance, S. aureus small colony variants (SCVs) have intracellular abilities and can persist without producing invasive infections. As a first step towards the development of a live vaccine, this study describes the elaboration of a novel attenuated mutant of S. aureus taking advantage of the SCV phenotype. A genetically stable SCV was created through the deletion of the hemB gene, impairing its ability to adapt and revert to the invasive phenotype. Further attenuation was obtained through inactivation of gene vraG (SACOL0720) which we previously showed to be important for full virulence during bovine IMIs. After infection of bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T), the double mutant (ΔvraGΔhemB) was less internalized and caused less cell destruction than that seen with ΔhemB and ΔvraG, respectively. In a murine IMI model, the ΔvraGΔhemB mutant was strongly attenuated, with a reduction of viable counts of up to 5-log10 CFU/g of mammary gland when compared to the parental strain. A complete clearance of ΔvraGΔhemB from glands was observed whereas mortality rapidly (48h) occurred with the wild-type strain. Immunization of mice using subcutaneous injections of live ΔvraGΔhemB raised a strong immune response as judged by the high total IgG titers measured against bacterial cell extracts and by the high IgG2a/IgG1 ratio observed against the IsdH protein. Also, ΔvraGΔhemB had sufficient common features with bovine mastitis strains so that the antibody response also strongly recognized strains from a variety of mastitis associated spa types.

The resulting model inherits the realistic dynamics achieved by a two-lane traffic model and aims to incorporate phenomena caused by driver-driver interactions. To achieve this goal, a game-theoretic description of driver interaction was developed. This game-theoretic formalization allows one to model different lane-changing behaviors and to keep track of mobility performance. We simulate the evolution of cooperation, traffic flow, and mobility performance for different modeled behaviors. The analysis of these results indicates a mobility optimization process achieved by drivers’ interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2549471714,"An ecological correlation study of the prevalence of hypertension with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa was conducted to determine the extent to which these conditions coincide at country level. Methods Data on prevalence of hypertension were derived from a systematic search of literature published between 1975 and 2014 with corresponding national estimates on HIV prevalence and antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage from the Demographic and Health Surveys and the joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS databases. National estimates on gross national income (GNI) and under-five mortality were obtained from the World Bank database. Linear regression analyses using robust standard errors (allowing for clustering at country level) were carried out for associations of age-standardised hypertension prevalence ratios (standardized to rural Uganda’s hypertension prevalence data) with HIV prevalence, adjusted for national indicators, year of study and sex of the study population. Results In total, 140 estimates of prevalence of hypertension representing 25 nations were sex-and area-matched with corresponding HIV prevalence. A two-fold increase in HIV prevalence was associated with a 9.29% increase in age, sex and study year-adjusted prevalence ratio for hypertension (95% CI 2.0 to 16.5, p = 0.01), which increased to 16.3% (95% CI 9.3 to 21.1) after adjusting for under-five mortality, GNI per capita and ART coverage. Conclusions Countries with a pronounced burden of HIV may also have an increased burden of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension with potential economic and health systems implications."
https://openalex.org/W2551016668,"T lymphocytes require signals from self-peptides and cytokines, most notably interleukins 7 and 15 (IL-7, IL-15), for survival. While mouse T cells die rapidly if IL-7 or IL-15 is withdrawn, human T cells can survive prolonged withdrawal of IL-7 and IL-15. Here we show that IL-7 and IL-15 are required to maintain human T cell proliferative capacity through the STAT5 signaling pathway. T cells from humanized mice proliferate better if stimulated in the presence of human IL-7 or IL-15 or if T cells are exposed to human IL-7 or IL-15 in mice. Freshly isolated T cells from human peripheral blood lose proliferative capacity if cultured for 24 hours in the absence of IL-7 or IL-15. We further show that phosphorylation of STAT5 correlates with proliferation and inhibition of STAT5 reduces proliferation. These results reveal a novel role of IL-7 and IL-15 in maintaining human T cell function, provide an explanation for T cell dysfunction in humanized mice, and have significant implications for in vitro studies with human T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2552675883,"Human retinoid X receptor α (hRXRα) plays a critical role in DNA binding and transcriptional activity through heterodimeric association with several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including the human vitamin D receptor (hVDR). We previously showed that hRXRα phosphorylation at serine 260 through the Ras-Raf-MAPK ERK1/2 activation is responsible for resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3), the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D3. To further investigate the mechanism of this resistance, we studied intranuclear dynamics of hVDR and hRXRα-tagged constructs in living cells together with endogenous and tagged protein in fixed cells. We find that hVDR-, hRXRα-, and hVDR-hRXRα complex accumulate in the nucleus in 1α,25(OH)2D3-treated HPK1A cells but to a lesser extent in HPK1ARas-treated cells. Also, by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we demonstrate increased interaction of the hVDR-hRXRα complex in 1α,25(OH)2D3-treated HPK1A but not HPK1ARas cells. In HPK1ARas cells, 1α,25(OH)2D3-induced nuclear localization and interaction of hRXRα are restored when cells are treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126 or following transfection of the non-phosphorylatable hRXRα Ala-260 mutant. Finally, we demonstrate using fluorescence loss in photobleaching and quantitative co-localization with chromatin that RXR immobilization and co-localization with chromatin are significantly increased in 1α,25(OH)2D3-treated HPK1ARas cells transfected with the non-phosphorylatable hRXRα Ala-260 mutant. This suggests that hRXRα phosphorylation significantly disrupts its nuclear localization, interaction with VDR, intra-nuclear trafficking, and binding to chromatin of the hVDR-hRXR complex.

https://openalex.org/W2554511718,"We show that by using a combination of computational methods, consistent three-dimensional molecular models can be proposed for the core proteins of the type-III secretion system. We employed a variety of approaches to reconcile disparate, and sometimes inconsistent, data sources into a coherent picture that for most of the proteins indicated a unique solution to the constraints. The range of difficulty spanned from the trivial (FliQ) to the difficult (FlhA and FliP). The uncertainties encountered with FlhA were largely the result of the greater number of helix packing possibilities allowed in a large protein, however, for FliP, there remains an uncertainty in how to reconcile the large displacement predicted between its two main helical hairpins and their ability to sit together happily across the bacterial membrane. As there is still no high resolution structural information on any of these proteins, we hope our predicted models may be of some use in aiding the interpretation of electron microscope images and in rationalising mutation data and experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2553294417,"Background Induction treatment with rabbit polyclonal antithymocyte globulins (ATGs) is frequent used in kidney transplant recipients with donorspecific HLA antibodies and shows acceptable outcomes. The two commonly used ATGs, Thymoglobulin and ATG-F have slightly different antigen profile and antibody concentrations. The two compounds have never been directly compared in a prospective trial in immunological high-risk recipients. Therefore we performed a prospective randomized controlled study comparing the two compounds in immunological high-risk kidney recipients in terms of safety and efficacy. Methods Immunological high-risk kidney recipients, defined as the presence of HLA DSA but negative CDC-B and T-cell crossmatches were randomized 1:1 to receive ATG-F or Thymoglobulin. Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. Results The per-protocol analysis included 35 patients. There was no immediate infusion reaction observed with both compounds. No PTLD or malignancy occurred during the follow-up in both groups. The incidence of viral and bacterial infections was similar in both groups (p = 0.62). The cumulative incidence of clinical and subclinical antibody mediated allograft rejection as well as T-cell mediated allograft rejection during the first year between ATG-F and Thymoglobulin was similar (35% versus 19%; p = 0.30 and 11% versus 18%; 0.54 respectively). The two-year graft function was similar with a median eGFR of 56 ml/min/1.73m2 (range 21–128) (ATG-F-group) and 51 ml/min/1.73m2 (range 22–132) (Thymo-group) (p = 0.69). Conclusion We found no significant differences between the compared study drugs for induction treatment in immunological high-risk patients regarding safety and efficacy during follow-up with good allograft function at 2 years after transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2554657649,"Sucrose-phosphate phosphatase (SPP) catalyses the final step in the sucrose biosynthesis pathway. Arabidopsis thaliana genome codifies four SPP isoforms. In this study, the four Arabidopsis thaliana genes coding for SPP isoforms have been cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli and the kinetic and regulatory properties of the purified enzymes analysed. SPP2 is the isoform showing the highest activity, with SPP3b and SPP3a showing lower activity levels. No activity was detected for SPP1. We propose that this lack of activity is probably due to the absence of an essential amino acid participating in catalysis and/or in the binding of the substrate, sucrose-6-phosphate (Suc6P). The expression patterns of Arabidopsis SPP genes indicate that SPP2 and SPP3b are the main isoforms expressed in different tissues and organs, although the non-catalytic SPP1 is the main isoform expressed in roots. Thus, SPP1 could have acquired new unknown functions. We also show that the three catalytically active SPPs from Arabidopsis are dimers. By generating a chimeric SPP composed of the monomeric cyanobacterial SPP fused to the higher plant non-catalytic S6PPc domain (from SPP2), we show that the S6PPc domain is responsible for SPP dimerization. This is the first experimental study on the functionality and gene expression pattern of all the SPPs from a single plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2552896396,"Potamogeton is one of the most difficult groups to clarify in aquatic plants, which has an extensive range of interspecific morphological and ecological diversity. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is prevalent for phylogenetic analysis in plants. However, most researches demonstrate that ITS has a high percentage of homoplasy in phylogenetic datasets. In this study, eighteen materials were collected in Potamogeton from China and incongruence was shown between the rbcL and ITS phylogenies. To solve the discrepancy, we employed a novel barcode PHYB to improve resolution and accuracy of the phylogenetic relationships. The PHYB phylogeny successfully resolved the incongruence between the rbcL and ITS phylogenies. In addition, six hybrids were confirmed using PHYB, including P. compressus × P. pusillus, P. octandrus × P. oxyphyllus, P. gramineus × P. lucens, P. distinctus × P. natans, P. distinctus × P. wrightii, and S. pectinata × S. amblyophylla. Whereas, only one hybrid was identified (P. compressus × P. pusillus) by ITS, indicating that ITS homoplasy was present in Potamogeton and ITS was completely homogenized to one parental lineage. Thus, ITS might have limited utility for phylogenetic relationships in Potamogeton. It is recommended that a three-locus combination of chloroplast DNA gene, ITS and PHYB is potential to effectively reveal more robust phylogenetic relationships and species identification."
https://openalex.org/W2552898890,"We present here a novel genetic algorithm-based random forest (GARF) modeling technique that enables a reduction in the complexity of large gene disease signatures to highly accurate, greatly simplified gene panels.

Additionally, using this approach we produced a 32-gene panel which allows for better consistency between RNA-seq and microarray-based classifications, improving cross-platform classification retention from 69.67% to 86.07%.

https://openalex.org/W2555143230,"Olfactory dysfunction is associated with normal aging, multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body disease and Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases such as diabetes, sleep apnea and the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis. The wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders associated with olfactory dysfunction suggests different, potentially overlapping, underlying pathophysiologies. Studying olfactory dysfunction in presymptomatic carriers of mutations known to cause familial parkinsonism provides unique opportunities to understand the role of genetic factors, delineate the salient characteristics of the onset of olfactory dysfunction, and understand when it starts relative to motor and cognitive symptoms. We evaluated olfactory dysfunction in 28 carriers of two MAPT mutations (p.N279K, p.P301L), which cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism, using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Olfactory dysfunction in carriers does not appear to be allele specific, but is strongly age-dependent and precedes symptomatic onset. Severe olfactory dysfunction, however, is not a fully penetrant trait at the time of symptom onset. Principal component analysis revealed that olfactory dysfunction is not odor-class specific, even though individual odor responses cluster kindred members according to genetic and disease status. Strikingly, carriers with incipient olfactory dysfunction show poor inter-test consistency among the sets of odors identified incorrectly in successive replicate tests, even before severe olfactory dysfunction appears. Furthermore, when 78 individuals without neurodegenerative disease and 14 individuals with sporadic Parkinson’s disease were evaluated twice at a one-year interval using the Brief Smell Identification Test, the majority also showed inconsistency in the sets of odors they identified incorrectly, independent of age and cognitive status. While these findings may reflect the limitations of these tests used and the sample sizes, olfactory dysfunction appears to be associated with the inability to identify odors reliably and consistently, not with the loss of an ability to identify specific odors. Irreproducibility in odor identification appears to be a non-disease-specific, general feature of olfactory dysfunction that is accelerated or accentuated in neurodegenerative disease. It may reflect a fundamental organizational principle of the olfactory system, which is more “error-prone” than other sensory systems."
https://openalex.org/W2549360377,"Web spammers aim to obtain higher ranks for their web pages by including spam contents that deceive search engines in order to include their pages in search results even when they are not related to the search terms. Search engines continue to develop new web spam detection mechanisms, but spammers also aim to improve their tools to evade detection. In this study, we first explore the effect of the page language on spam detection features and we demonstrate how the best set of detection features varies according to the page language. We also study the performance of Google Penguin, a newly developed anti-web spamming technique for their search engine. Using spam pages in Arabic as a case study, we show that unlike similar English pages, Google anti-spamming techniques are ineffective against a high proportion of Arabic spam pages. We then explore multiple detection features for spam pages to identify an appropriate set of features that yields a high detection accuracy compared with the integrated Google Penguin technique. In order to build and evaluate our classifier, as well as to help researchers to conduct consistent measurement studies, we collected and manually labeled a corpus of Arabic web pages, including both benign and spam pages. Furthermore, we developed a browser plug-in that utilizes our classifier to warn users about spam pages after clicking on a URL and by filtering out search engine results. Using Google Penguin as a benchmark, we provide an illustrative example to show that language-based web spam classifiers are more effective for capturing spam contents."
https://openalex.org/W2549167082,"Leukotrienes (LTs) are inflammatory mediators that play a pivotal role in many diseases like asthma bronchiale, atherosclerosis and in various types of cancer. The key enzyme for generation of LTs is the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Here, we present a novel putative protein isoform of human 5-LO that lacks exon 4, termed 5-LOΔ4, identified in cells of lymphoid origin, namely the Burkitt lymphoma cell lines Raji and BL41 as well as primary B and T cells. Deletion of exon 4 does not shift the reading frame and therefore the mRNA is not subjected to non-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). By eliminating exon 4, the amino acids Trp144 until Ala184 are omitted in the corresponding protein. Transfection of HEK293T cells with a 5-LOΔ4 expression plasmid led to expression of the corresponding protein which suggests that the 5-LOΔ4 isoform is a stable protein in eukaryotic cells. We were also able to obtain soluble protein after expression in E. coli and purification. The isoform itself lacks canonical enzymatic activity as it misses the non-heme iron but it still retains ATP-binding affinity. Differential scanning fluorimetric analysis shows two transitions, corresponding to the two domains of 5-LO. Whilst the catalytic domain of 5-LO WT is destabilized by calcium, addition of calcium has no influence on the catalytic domain of 5-LOΔ4. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of 5-LOΔ4 on the activity of 5-LO WT and proved that it stimulates 5-LO product formation at low protein concentrations. Therefore regulation of 5-LO by its isoform 5-LOΔ4 might represent a novel mechanism of controlling the biosynthesis of lipid mediators."
https://openalex.org/W2552587176,"Hyperactivation of STAT3 via constitutive phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 (Y705) is common in most human cancers, including head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC). STAT3 is rarely mutated in cancer and the (epi)genetic alterations that lead to STAT3 activation are incompletely understood. Here we used an unbiased approach to identify genomic and epigenomic changes associated with pSTAT3(Y705) expression using data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).Mutation, mRNA expression, promoter methylation, and copy number alteration data were extracted from TCGA and examined in the context of pSTAT3(Y705) protein expression. mRNA expression levels of 1279 genes were found to be associated with pSTAT3(705) expression. Association of pSTAT3(Y705) expression with caspase-8 mRNA expression was validated by immunoblot analysis in HNSCC cells. Mutation, promoter hypermethylation, and copy number alteration of any gene were not significantly associated with increased pSTAT3(Y705) protein expression.These cumulative results suggest that unbiased approaches may be useful in identifying the molecular underpinnings of oncogenic signaling, including STAT3 activation, in HNSCC. Larger datasets will likely be necessary to elucidate signaling consequences of infrequent alterations."
https://openalex.org/W2556672789,"Cloned mice derived from somatic or ES cells show placental overgrowth (placentomegaly) at term. We had previously analyzed cloned and normal mouse placentae by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to identify differential protein expression patterns. Cloned placentae showed upregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), which is involved in extracellular matrix degradation and tissue remodeling, and downregulation of pre-B cell colony enhancing factor 1 (PBEF), which inhibits apoptosis and induces spontaneous labor. Here, we used Western blotting to further analyze the protein expression levels of TIMP-2 and PBEF in cloned placentae derived from cumulus cells, TSA-treated cumulus cells, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and natural mating (NM control). Cloned and TSA-treated cloned placentae had higher expression levels of TIMP-2 compared with NM control and ICSI-derived placentae, and there was a positive association between TIMP-2 expression and the placental weight of cloned mouse concepti. Conversely, PBEF protein expression was significantly lower in cloned and ICSI placentae compared to NM controls. To examine whether the observed differences were due to abnormal gene expression caused by faulty epigenetic reprogramming in clones, we investigated DNA methylation and histone modification in the promoter regions of the genes encoding TIMP-2 and PBEF. Sodium bisulfite sequencing did not reveal any difference in DNA methylation between cloned and NM control placentae. However, ChIP assays revealed that the level of H3-K9/K14 acetylation at the TIMP-2 locus was higher in cloned placentae than in NM controls, whereas acetylation of the PBEF promoter was lower in cloned and ICSI placenta versus NM controls. These results suggest that cloned placentae appear to suffer from failure of histone modification-based reprogramming in these (and potentially other) developmentally important genes, leading to aberrant expression of their protein products. These changes are likely to be involved in generating the abnormalities seen in cloned mouse placentae, including enlargement and/or a lack of proper placental function."

An auxiliary technique referred to as checkpoints can be applied to the rainbow tradeoff to reduce the time taken for these inversions. Working out a rigorous theory that can explain and predict the effects of this technique involves delicate manipulations of the random function and is thus a challenging task. In this work, we compare three existing theoretical analyses of the checkpoint technique. We first demonstrate that the claims made by the three works are incompatible with each other. We then carry out experiments designed to highlight these incompatibilities, obtaining experimental evidences that show just one of the three analyses to be correct. Finally, we discuss the obscure theoretical errors made by the two inadequate analyses."
