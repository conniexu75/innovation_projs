https://openalex.org/W3030748957,"The mode of acquisition and causes for the variable clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unknown. We utilized a reverse genetics system to generate a GFP reporter virus to explore severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogenesis and a luciferase reporter virus to demonstrate sera collected from SARS and COVID-19 patients exhibited limited cross-CoV neutralization. High-sensitivity RNA in situ mapping revealed the highest angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in the nose with decreasing expression throughout the lower respiratory tract, paralleled by a striking gradient of SARS-CoV-2 infection in proximal (high) versus distal (low) pulmonary epithelial cultures. COVID-19 autopsied lung studies identified focal disease and, congruent with culture data, SARS-CoV-2-infected ciliated and type 2 pneumocyte cells in airway and alveolar regions, respectively. These findings highlight the nasal susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 with likely subsequent aspiration-mediated virus seeding to the lung in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. These reagents provide a foundation for investigations into virus-host interactions in protective immunity, host susceptibility, and virus pathogenesis."

Here, we examine the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication by determining the cryo-EM structures of the stalled pre- and post- translocated polymerase complexes. Compared with the apo complex, the structures show notable structural rearrangements happening to nsp12 and its co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 to accommodate the nucleic acid, whereas there are highly conserved residues in nsp12, positioning the template and primer for an in-line attack on the incoming nucleotide. Furthermore, we investigate the inhibition mechanism of the triphosphate metabolite of remdesivir through structural and kinetic analyses. A transition model from the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecameric primase complex to the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 polymerase complex is also proposed to provide clues for the understanding of the coronavirus transcription and replication machinery."

Dozens of drugs have been shown to be metabolized by single isolates from the gut microbiome, but the extent of this phenomenon is rarely explored in the context of microbial communities. Here, we develop a quantitative experimental framework for mapping the ability of the human gut microbiome to metabolize small molecule drugs: Microbiome-Derived Metabolism (MDM)-Screen. Included are a batch culturing system for sustained growth of subject-specific gut microbial communities, an ex vivo drug metabolism screen, and targeted and untargeted functional metagenomic screens to identify microbiome-encoded genes responsible for specific metabolic events.

The oral route is the most common route for drug administration. Upon exiting the stomach, drugs can be absorbed in the small and/or large intestine to reach systemic circulation and eventually the liver or directly transported there via the portal vein. In the liver, drugs may be metabolized and secreted back to the intestines through bile—via enterohepatic circulation (Kimura et al., 1994Kimura T. Sudo K. Kanzaki Y. Miki K. Takeichi Y. Kurosaki Y. Nakayama T. Drug absorption from large intestine: physicochemical factors governing drug absorption.Biol. Pharm.

Pharmacol. Ther. 2013; 94: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Even parenterally administered drugs and their metabolites can reach the intestines through biliary secretion. Thus, whether prior to or after absorption, some administered drugs will spend a considerable amount of time in the small and large intestines, where our human gut microbiome resides. It is therefore important to study gut microbiome composition and function, specifically as it relates to drug interactions, while accounting for the significant variability between individuals (Falony et al., 2016Falony G. Joossens M. Vieira-Silva S. Wang J. Darzi Y. Faust K. Kurilshikov A. Bonder M.J. Valles-Colomer M. Vandeputte D. et al.Population-level analysis of gut microbiome variation.Science. 2016; 352: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Broadly speaking, the microbiome interacts with drugs both directly and indirectly. Indirect interactions include competition between microbiome-derived metabolites and administered drugs for the same host metabolizing enzymes (Clayton et al., 2009Clayton T.A. Baker D. Lindon J.C.

Dispos. 2009; 37: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Direct interactions include the partial or complete biochemical transformation of a drug into more or less active metabolites by microbiome-derived enzymes (termed herein: Microbiome-Derived Metabolism, or MDM). The human gut microbiome harbors hundreds of bacterial species, encoding an estimated 100 times more genes than the human genome (Qin et al., 2010Qin J. Li R. Raes J. Arumugam M. Burgdorf K.S. Manichanh C. Nielsen T. Pons N. Levenez F. Yamada T. et al.MetaHIT ConsortiumA human gut microbial gene catalogue established by metagenomic sequencing.Nature. 2010; 464: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (6070) Google Scholar). This enormous diversity and richness represent a repertoire of yet-uncharacterized biochemical activities capable of metabolizing ingested chemicals (Bäckhed et al., 2005Bäckhed F. Ley R.E.

Maini Rekdal V. Balskus E.P. Chemical transformation of xenobiotics by the human gut microbiota.Science. 2017; 356: eaag2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although MDM has been observed in dozens of examples for the past 50 years, this process is still mostly overlooked in the drug development pipeline where little to no effort is spent on determining the specific role of MDM in pharmacokinetics (Ilett et al., 1990Ilett K.F.

The microbial pharmacists within us: a metagenomic view of xenobiotic metabolism.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This is because of the vast complexity of the microbiome, and overwhelming technical challenge of testing hundreds of drugs against thousands of cultured isolates under multiple conditions. In contrast to liver-derived metabolism, we lack a systematic and standardized map of MDM, hindering our ability to reliably predict and eventually interfere with undesired microbiome effects on drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. To address this gap in knowledge, we developed a quantitative experimental workflow for mapping MDM of orally administered drugs using personalized gut microbiome-derived microbial communities (MDM-Screen). The methods and findings reported here provide a framework for discovering and characterizing novel cases of MDM and for potentially incorporating an “MDM module” in the drug development pipeline. A major challenge in studying the capacity of the human gut microbiome to metabolize orally administered drugs is the diversity of bacterial species and strains involved (Almeida et al., 2019Almeida A.

Because it is impractical to systematically screen thousands of isolated strains against hundreds of drugs, previous studies have relied mainly on monocultures of a selected set of representative species. However, gene expression and biochemical transformation profiles vary dramatically between a strain grown in monoculture versus in a mixed community. To address these challenges, we sought to develop an optimized ex vivo mixed culturing system that supports the growth of a large proportion of the species from a given microbiome sample and is amenable to high-throughput (HT) biochemical screens. We began our screening efforts focused on a single microbiome donor (pilot donor, PD). To identify the medium and culturing period that can support the growth of a batch culture whose composition is maximally similar to the original PD microbiome, freshly collected and glycerol-stocked human feces from PD were cultured in 14 different media and sampled daily for four days. We then extracted DNA from all samples, amplified the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, and deeply sequenced the amplicons (Figure 1A). From the sequencing results, amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were inferred and the taxonomic composition at different levels was determined for each sample (see STAR Methods) (Bokulich et al., 2018Bokulich N.A.

Hugenholtz P. An improved Greengenes taxonomy with explicit ranks for ecological and evolutionary analyses of bacteria and archaea.ISME J. 2012; 6: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar). We then quantified the differences between the various media and PD at the family level (using the Jensen-Shannon divergence, DJS), and the variant recovery from PD at the single ASV level. As expected, we observed a great level of variation in both the taxonomic composition and diversity between the different media and culturing periods. Some media led to highly diverse communities that captured portions of the original fecal diversity, while others became dominated almost exclusively by a single family. Among the 14 media commonly used in gut microbiome cultivation efforts (Rettedal et al., 2014Rettedal E.A. Gumpert H. Sommer M.O. Cultivation-based multiplex phenotyping of human gut microbiota allows targeted recovery of previously uncultured bacteria.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we identified one, modified Gifu Anaerobic Medium (mGAM), that supported the growth of a bacterial community most similar in composition and diversity to PD’s (Figures 1B and S1A). At the family level, mGAM cultures largely match the composition of PD, differing primarily in a commonly observed expansion of the facultative anaerobes, Enterobacteriaceae, at the expense of the obligate anaerobes, Ruminococcaceae (McDonald et al., 2018McDonald D. Hyde E. Debelius J.W. Morton J.T. Gonzalez A. Ackermann G. Aksenov A.A. Behsaz B. Brennan C. Chen Y. et al.American Gut ConsortiumAmerican Gut: an Open Platform for Citizen Science Microbiome Research.mSystems. 2018; 3: e00031-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among all tested media, mGAM cultures showed the lowest DJS divergence from PD, becoming increasingly similar to the original sample as growth proceeds (Figure S1A). Even at the single ASV level, mGAM cultures capture much of the diversity in PD (mGAM cultures have the highest Shannon diversity across all media, and the closest one to PD) (Figure 1C). In PD, there are 33 ASVs present above a relative abundance of 1%, 26 (79%) of which are present in mGAM day two culture. Overall, total shared ASVs between PD and mGAM day two account for 70% of the PD composition (by relative abundance), indicating that the mGAM culture recapitulates the bulk of the original community. Taken together, and consistent with previous reports showing that mGAM can support the growth of a wide variety of gut microorganisms in monoculture (Rettedal et al., 2014Rettedal E.A. Gumpert H.

Bork P. et al.Nutritional preferences of human gut bacteria reveal their metabolic idiosyncrasies.Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), our results support the use of mGAM day two cultures as a viable ex vivo batch culturing model for the PD microbiome. With an optimized ex vivo culturing system for PD in hand, we next developed a combined biochemical and analytical chemistry approach to map the capacity of PD-derived microbial communities to metabolize clinically used, orally administered drugs (MDM-Screen) (Figure 2A). Three samples were prepared per drug of interest: (1) a 24-h mGAM ex vivo culture of PD, incubated with the drug of interest (final concentration 33 μM, in line with estimates of drug concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract) (Maier et al., 2018Maier L. Pruteanu M. Kuhn M. Zeller G. Telzerow A. Anderson E.E. Brochado A.R. Fernandez K.C. Dose H. Mori H. et al.Extensive impact of non-antibiotic drugs on human gut bacteria.Nature. 2018; 555: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), (2) a similar culture incubated with a vehicle control (DMSO), and (3) an equal volume of sterile mGAM, incubated with the same drug concentration. Cultures and controls were then incubated for an additional 24 h at 37°C in an anaerobic chamber, chemically extracted, and analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). To verify the reproducibility, the entire procedure was repeated three consecutive times. We tested a diverse library of 575 orally administered drugs, and although the majority of the drugs in this library are currently being used in the clinic, less than 10% of them had been previously explored with respect to MDM (Table S1A). A drug was deemed MDM+ when (1) a new metabolite was observed when incubated with PD culture or (2) the drug was no longer detected when incubated with PD culture, indicating that it is either consumed entirely or metabolized into a molecule that fails our detection, and (3) the drug was metabolized in the same manner during at least two of three independent experiments. Among the 575 drugs, we successfully analyzed 438 (76%); the remaining 137 failed MDM-Screen because of issues related to drug stability or incompatibilities with the extraction or chromatography methods employed (see Discussion). Of the successfully analyzed drugs, we identified 57 (13%) as MDM+. These spanned 28 pharmacological classes and even more based on their chemical structure (Figure 2B; Table S1B; Data S1). As expected, several previously reported MDM cases were identified. These include the nitroreduction of the muscle relaxant dantrolene (Kuroiwa et al., 1985Kuroiwa M. Inotsume N. Iwaoku R. Nakano M.

The role of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of salicylazosulfapyridine.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1972; 181: 555-562PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, we identified a suite of novel MDM cases (45 cases, ∼80% of the MDM+ drugs): ten resulted from full depletion of the parent drug (or full conversion to a metabolite that evades our detection), while 35 resulted from the appearance of a new metabolite (Figures 2C and 2D; Table S1B; Data S1A). In most cases, the new metabolites showed a high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) profile within a small difference from their parent drugs and/or a similar tandem MS fragmentation (HRMS/MS) pattern, indicating that they are derivatives (Wang et al., 2016Wang M. Carver J.J. Phelan V.V. Sanchez L.M. Garg N. Peng Y. Nguyen D.D. Watrous J. Kapono C.A. Luzzatto-Knaan T. et al.Sharing and community curation of mass spectrometry data with Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 828-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) (Table S1B; Data S1B). An aggregate statistical analysis of MDM+ and MDM− drugs revealed specific structural features that are significantly enriched in MDM+ drugs (e.g., a steroidal skeleton, nitro groups, ketones, among others) (see STAR Methods; Table S1C). Although HRMS and HRMS/MS analyses can narrow down the number of possibilities for the molecular structure of a given metabolite, they are not sufficient for full structural determination. Thus, we selected seven MDM+ examples for detailed characterization of their resulting metabolites: spironolactone (anti-hypertensive), tolcapone (anti-Parkinson’s), misoprostol (anti-ulcer), mycophenolate mofetil (immunosuppressant), capecitabine (anticancer), and finally, hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone acetate (two steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that produced an identical MDM metabolite). In all but one example, no direct drug-microbiome interactions had been previously reported. The exception was hydrocortisone where several metabolites had been previously reported from individual gut isolates (Ridlon et al., 2013Ridlon J.M. Ikegawa S. Alves J.M. Zhou B. Kobayashi A. Iida T. Mitamura K. Tanabe G. Serrano M. De Guzman A. et al.Clostridium scindens: a human gut microbe with a high potential to convert glucocorticoids into androgens.J.

Steroid Biochem. 1982; 17: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but the identity of the MDM metabolite we observed could not be accurately matched to any of them based on MS alone. To unequivocally determine the structure of the resulting metabolites, we isolated them from scaled-up biochemical incubations with PD cultures and elucidated their structures using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and/or comparison to an authentic standard (STAR Methods; Data S2). For hydrocortisone, we determined that MDM results in the reduction of the ketone group at C20, producing 20β-dihydrocortisone. For hydrocortisone acetate, the same modification occurs but is accompanied with deacetylation of the C21 hydroxyl group (Figure S2). While C20 ketone reduction was previously reported for hydrocortisone (to produce either 20β-dihydrocortisone or 20α-dihydrocortisone depending on the gut isolate incubated with it; Ridlon et al., 2013Ridlon J.M. Ikegawa S. Alves J.M. Zhou B. Kobayashi A. Iida T. Mitamura K. Tanabe G. Serrano M.

Formation of 20 β-dihydrosteroids by anaerobic bacteria.J. Steroid Biochem. 1982; 17: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), neither MDM deacetylation nor C20 ketone reduction were reported for hydrocortisone acetate. For capecitabine, we show that MDM results in complete deglycosylation; for misoprostol and mycophenolate mofetil, we observed an ester hydrolysis transformation; and in the case of spironolactone, a thioester hydrolysis one. None of these MDM transformations were previously reported for these drugs. Finally, for tolcapone, we observed two consecutive transformations, a typical nitroreduction followed by a relatively uncommon N-acetylation—neither of which had been previously linked to the microbiome for this drug (Figure 2D). Taken together, these results establish MDM-Screen as a viable method for identifying both known and novel biochemical modifications of structurally and pharmacologically diverse drugs by the gut microbiome. Interestingly, based on already known pharmacokinetic studies in humans, some of these new MDM cases may have direct consequences on the activation or toxicity of the drugs involved. For example, in the case of spironolactone we observed the production of 7α-thiospironolactone, a postulated intermediate en route to the drug’s main active metabolite, 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (Gardiner et al., 1989Gardiner P.

For the prodrugs misoprostol and mycophenolate mofetil, we observed the production of their active metabolites misoprostol acid (Schoenhard et al., 1985Schoenhard G. Oppermann J. Kohn F.E.

Vancomycin relieves mycophenolate mofetil-induced gastrointestinal toxicity by eliminating gut bacterial β-glucuronidase activity.Sci Adv. 2019; 5: eaax2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), albeit generated via a different route—hydrolysis of a biliary secreted glucuronide conjugate by gut microbiome-derived β-glucuronidases. Finally, in the case of tolcapone, N-acetylamino-tolcapone has been detected systemically in humans post-tolcapone administration and was suggested to be involved in liver toxicity observed clinically following tolcapone use, yet the mechanism of its production remains unknown (Jorga et al., 1999Jorga K.

In vitro metabolism of tolcapone to reactive intermediates: relevance to tolcapone liver toxicity.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our discovery that the same metabolite can be produced via MDM provides a possible explanation, and a potential link between the gut microbiome and tolcapone toxicity. In all four cases, additional experiments need to be performed to differentiate the contribution of human- and microbiome-derived metabolism to the observed drug pharmacokinetics and/or toxicity in humans. Next, we sought to expand our framework to accommodate multiple subjects. To accomplish this goal, we needed to first design a generalizable quantitative metric for assessing the best culturing medium for microbiome samples (Figures 3A and 3B ). In our analysis of PD’s ex vivo cultures, we applied a variety of metrics and found a medium that was the best trade-off between richness, evenness, and compositional similarity. However, this approach is not scalable to a large number of donors and also ignores the role of community biomass, which may lead to suboptimal media selection. Therefore, we developed a metric called Expected Number of Detectable Strains (ENDS), a corrected richness metric where the contribution of each ASV is weighed by the probability that its metabolite can be detected while considering total biomass (STAR Methods; Figure 3B; Methods S1). The core idea is that we desire a medium that supports the highest number of different bacterial ASVs, while ensuring that the metabolic contributions of these ASVs are detectable by our experimental method. ENDS utilizes two data inputs related to the ex vivo culture composition: relative abundance at a given taxonomic level and total community biomass;"

The medial septum (MS) is critical in theta generation by two possible mechanisms: either a unitary “pacemaker” timing signal is imposed on the hippocampal system, or it may assist in organizing target subcircuits within the phase space of theta oscillations. We used temperature manipulation of the MS to test these models. Cooling of the MS reduced both theta frequency and power and was associated with an enhanced incidence of errors in a spatial navigation task, but it did not affect spatial correlates of neurons. MS cooling decreased theta frequency oscillations of place cells and reduced distance-time compression but preserved distance-phase compression of place field sequences within the theta cycle. Thus, the septum is critical for sustaining precise theta phase coordination of cell assemblies in the hippocampal system, a mechanism needed for spatial memory."

The signature identified cancer patients prior to a clinical diagnosis and was superior to alpha-fetoprotein. In summary, we established a viral exposure signature that can predict HCC among at-risk patients prior to a clinical diagnosis, which may be useful in HCC surveillance. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a main histological type of primary liver cancer, is considered a virus-related malignancy in which hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) are major etiological factors (Farazi and DePinho, 2006Farazi P.A. DePinho R.A. Hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis: from genes to environment.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 674-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Viral hepatitis causes inflammation and chronic liver diseases (CLDs), which may lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually, HCC. While HBV or HCV chronic carriers have an increased risk of developing HCC, the risk varies among individuals, and not all patients with liver disease develop liver cancer (Arzumanyan et al., 2013Arzumanyan A. Reis H.M. Feitelson M.A. Pathogenic mechanisms in HBV- and HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). An effective strategy to prevent HCC is to eliminate causative factors. However, while direct-acting antiviral treatment is remarkably effective in eliminating HCV infection, it reduces, but cannot eliminate, HCC risk (Carrat et al., 2019Carrat F. Fontaine H. Dorival C. Simony M. Diallo A. Hezode C. De Ledinghen V. Larrey D. Haour G. Bronowicki J.P. et al.French ANRS CO22 Hepather cohortClinical outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis C after direct-acting antiviral treatment: a prospective cohort study.Lancet. 2019; 393: 1453-1464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, Janjua et al., 2017Janjua N.Z.

Hepatol. 2017; 66: 504-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similarly, HBV vaccination, when introduced in the early 1980s, has been successful in significantly reducing the number of HBV carriers. Still, it only modestly reduces HCC burden in HBV-prevalent areas (Chang et al., 2016Chang M.H. You S.L. Chen C.J. Liu C.J. Lai M.W. Wu T.C. Wu S.F. Lee C.M. Yang S.S.

It is puzzling that the control of HBV infection in HBV-prevalent areas, as well as HCV infection, has been remarkably successful for decades, while the global HCC incidence and mortality rates continues to increase since the 1990s (Liu et al., 2019bLiu Z. Jiang Y. Yuan H. Fang Q. Cai N. Suo C. Jin L. Zhang T. Chen X.

Hepatol. 2019; 70: 674-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Changing trends of etiological factors such as alcohol and non-alcohol and non-viral-related liver diseases likely contribute to the observed increase. Thus, in addition to cancer prevention, early detection remains a key approach to prevent HCC-inflicted mortality. Currently, medical society guidelines recommend biannual surveillance using ultrasound with or without alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for certain individuals with CLD and those with cirrhosis (Sherman et al., 2012Sherman M. Bruix J. Porayko M. Tran T. AASLD Practice Guidelines CommitteeScreening for hepatocellular carcinoma: the rationale for the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommendations.Hepatology. 2012; 56: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, these practices have yielded mixed results related to the effectiveness in detecting HCC at an early stage or to providing survival benefit (Moon et al., 2018Moon A.M. Weiss N.S. Beste L.A.

Notably, a majority of HCC patients are still diagnosed at an advanced stage, which precludes their chance to receive potentially curative therapies, leading to poor survival. Thus, there is an unmet need to identify an effective biomarker-guided surveillance program for early liver cancer detection. Viruses are known to affect human health by altering host immunity, which makes the interplay between the virome and the host crucial in the pathogenesis of human chronic diseases, including cancer (Cadwell, 2015Cadwell K. The virome in host health and disease.Immunity. 2015; 42: 805-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Foxman and Iwasaki, 2011Foxman E.F. Iwasaki A. Genome-virome interactions: examining the role of common viral infections in complex disease.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Diverse pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses may interact with one another as well as their host to shape host immunity, which may alter its response to new infections and cancer risk. Consequently, viruses that persist or are cleared in the host may leave unique molecular footprints that can affect host susceptibility to cancer and may serve as an excellent window of early onset of disease (Cadwell, 2015Cadwell K. The virome in host health and disease.Immunity. 2015; 42: 805-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that unique viral exposure signatures (VESs) resulting from virus-host interactions could reflect a cascade of events that may alter the risk of developing HCC. Such signatures may serve as early detection biomarkers and offer knowledge about potentially modifiable factors for early onset of HCC. In this study, we profiled serological samples from 899 individuals currently enrolled in an NCI-UMD (National Cancer Institute-University of Maryland) case-control study of liver cancer (NCT00913757; clinicaltrials.gov). We used a synthetic virome technology, VirScan, based on a high-throughput sequencing method, to detect the exposure history to all known human viruses (Xu et al., 2015Xu G.J. Kula T. Xu Q. Li M.Z. Vernon S.D. Ndung’u T. Ruxrungtham K. Sanchez J. Brander C. Chung R.T. et al.Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome.Science. 2015; 348: aaa0698Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Using the high-throughput method, we developed a unique VES that can discriminate HCC cases from at-risk or healthy volunteers, and then validated this signature in a prospective NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) at-risk cohort for HCC (NCT0001971; clinicaltrials.gov). VirScan applies a phage display library that covers 93,904 viral epitopes, representing 206 human viral species and over 1,000 viral strains, to screen for previous exposure history (Xu et al., 2015Xu G.J. Kula T. Xu Q. Li M.Z. Vernon S.D. Ndung’u T. Ruxrungtham K. Sanchez J. Brander C. Chung R.T. et al.Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome.Science. 2015; 348: aaa0698Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A phage particle with an epitope that was recognized by a participant’s antibody was immunoprecipitated (Phage-IP), and the encoding DNA barcode was then sequenced (Figure 1A). We used a case-control design of the Maryland (NCI-UMD) cohort for the discovery of viral exposure profiles. The inclusion and enrollment of the study subjects are outlined in Figure S1A, following the CONSORT guideline (Schulz et al., 2010Schulz K.F. Altman D.G. Moher D. CONSORT GroupCONSORT 2010 statement: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials.BMJ. 2010; 340: c332Crossref PubMed Scopus (4668) Google Scholar) (Table S1A). For the NCI-UMD cohort, VirScan Phage-IP products yielded 0.5–5 million single-end reads per serum sample, with mean mapped read matching accuracy of 0.93 (Figure 1B). A total of 30,033 viral epitopes were significantly enriched with a −log10(p value) greater than the reproducibility threshold of 2.358, which was determined based on both replicates (Figures S1B and S1C). It was noted that the composition of the viral types at the viral taxonomic level showed small yet noticeable differences between the obtained Phage-IP products and the library input (Figures S1D and S1E), indicating a measurable difference between patients-derived data and the original input. When assessing viral richness among healthy volunteers as a population control (PC), CLD patients as at risk (AR), and HCC, we found that the number of detected viral infections increases initially with the sample size but reaches saturation at a sample size of 200 or more (Figure 1C). We detected a median of seven species of virus per sample, with four individuals showing cross-reactivity to more than 20 virus species (Figure 1D). Overall, the number of viral species was similarly distributed among PC, AR, and HCC (Figure 1D), indicating no bias in the landscape of overall viral exposure profiles between these groups. The abundance of the most prevalent viral species, including human herpesvirus 4 (EBV) and human herpesvirus 5 (CMV), was similar in our study populations to what was reported in other populations (Figure 1E; Table S1B) (Xu et al., 2015Xu G.J. Kula T. Xu Q. Li M.Z. Vernon S.D. Ndung’u T. Ruxrungtham K. Sanchez J. Brander C. Chung R.T. et al.Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome.Science. 2015; 348: aaa0698Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and is consistent with previous epidemiology reports (Ho, 1990Ho M.

However, the HCV infection rate (26%) in our study was relatively high, which is explained by the high rates in AR (48%) and HCC (39%) (Table S1B; Figure S2). Intriguingly, we detected a wide range of unique viral epitopes for each viral species that were recognized among different participants, indicating that B cell antigenicity to the same viral species is rather diverse among the participants (right panel in Figure 1E, Figure S2).Figure S1CONSORT Flow Diagrams for NCI-UMD Cohort and VirScan Reproducibility and Viral Composition at DNA, RNA, Virus, and Viral Family Levels, Related to Figure 1, and NCI-UMD Cohort and VirScan PhIP-seq in STAR MethodsShow full caption(A) The diagram includes detailed information on the excluded participants from initial enrollment, sample allocation with indicated criteria, QC and final data analysis.

To further assess the quality of VirScan, we compared VirScan results with available medical chart entries for HCV, HBV, and HIV testing results and found that VirScan had 45%, 47%, and 70% specificity in detecting HCV, HBV, and HIV, respectively, when compared to these medical record data (Figure 2A). In contrast, its sensitivity was 84% for HCV, 48% for HBV, and 73% for HIV. It should be noted that a majority of viral status data from medical charts are unknown or missing (Table S2), which makes this comparison suboptimal. We also examined epitope enrichment of HCV1b, a major viral subtype associated with HCC (Bruno et al., 2007Bruno S. Crosignani A. Maisonneuve P. Rossi S. Silini E. Mondelli M.U. Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b as a major risk factor associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis: a seventeen-year prospective cohort study.Hepatology. 2007; 46: 1350-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). An increase in peptide enrichment, corresponding mainly to the core, NS4, and NS5A of HCV1b, was consistently observed among AR and HCC when compared to PC, which could be due to a high B cell antigenicity of the epitopes as indicated by a prediction score (Figure 2B). We also examined the presence of HIV and other viruses known to have co-infection with HIV (Chang et al., 2013Chang C.C. Crane M. Zhou J. Mina M. Post J.J. Cameron B.A. Lloyd A.R. Jaworowski A.

Chung R.T. et al.Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome.Science. 2015; 348: aaa0698Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found an increased co-infection prevalence for HIV with CMV, human adenovirus C, human adenovirus D, influenza B virus, human herpesvirus B and HBV at false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 (Figure 2C). Taken together, the above results revealed that VirScan is a reliable method to capture a broad spectrum of viral exposures with a simple serological assay. We applied a gradient boosting approach to search for the best-fit virus composition that can discriminate HCC from PC (Figure 3A). Using 10-fold cross validation and 1,000 random permutations first where 90% of samples were used for training and remaining 10% of samples were used as an independent validation, we found that a VES can significantly discriminate HCC from PC with area under the curve (AUC) values above 0.9 and 0.7 for training and cross validation, respectively (Figure 3B). This signature consisted of unique epitopes corresponding to 61 viral strains (Figure 3C). Among them, 18 viral strains were positively associated, while the remaining viruses were negatively associated, with HCC. A total of 11 HCV strains, including unique variants such as 3b or Taiwan 1b, were among the main contributing viruses in the signature. This observation was not surprising, since 39% of HCC cases from this cohort were HCV positive. We also found that CMV, HDV, and influenza virus strains H1N1 and H3N2 were enriched in the HCC group. In contrast, 43 viruses, such as human respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus 23, were preferentially depleted in the HCC group (Table S3A; Figure 3C). Weighed VES scores of the 61 viral strains differed significantly between HCC and PC (p < 0.0001), as well as between HCC and AR (p < 0.0001), which was not included for initial signature discovery, and also between AR and PC (p < 0.0001) (Figure 3D). There was a significant increase of the VES score among PC, AR, and HCC (p-trend < 0.0001), suggesting that VES was positively linked to hepatocarcinogenesis. We performed phylogenetic analysis of the reactive epitopes of the 61 viral strains to determine similarity among these HCC-related viruses (Figure 3E). To search common reactive viral epitopes either enriched or depleted in HCC, we restricted viral epitopes that rank at the top for their association with HCC. These viruses can be divided into eight main branches where different HCV epitopes are clustered together with other viral epitopes, with an exception of cluster #6, which contains six HCV variants (out of 12 viruses) (Figure 3E; Table S3B). In general, there was no clear enrichment within each branch for increased or decreased viruses, suggesting that varying viral epitopes involved in immunoreactivity are commonly shared among HCC. Since a majority of HCC patients has evidence of CLDs, to avoid this confounding variable, we also compared AR to HCC using the same gradient-boosting approach. We found that an AR versus HCC VES can significantly discriminate HCC from AR or PC with AUC values similar to VES for training and cross validation (Figures S3A and S3B). A majority of these VES-related viral strains overlap (Figure S3C). To further test the robustness of VES, we performed a 60/40 split where 60% of cases were used for VES discovery while the remaining 40% of cases were used for an independent prediction. We performed 1,000 permutations of the split to establish the confidence interval (CI). Again, we found similar VES with a mean of AUC 0.7 for prediction (Figures S3D–S3G). Collectively, these results indicate that a VES consisting of a certain set of viral epitopes is relatively stable and robust in discriminating HCC from AR or PC. Given a limited number of HCC cases in the NCI-UMD cohort, we decided to keep the original VES for further analysis. To determine if the host genetic background may be linked to VES, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the NCI-UMD cohort, as this approach may help to identify genetic variants susceptible to viral infection and cancer (Fumagalli et al., 2010Fumagalli M.

After quality assessment of genomic data using genetic quality control measures, 849 participants (PC = 402; AR = 323; HCC = 124) were included in the analysis. Following the removal of mono-allelic SNPs and the ones that deviate away from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we performed an association test for all the remaining SNPs. To further assess the quality of our GWAS data, we determined whether there was an association between an SNP, rs12979860 in IL28B, and HCV infection. As its favorable genotype, CC has been shown to be associated with better HCV treatment response or natural clearance. We found that rs12979860-CC was significantly associated with HCV genotype 3 with odds ratio (OR) 2.74 (95% CI 1.14–7.97) in a dominant model manner (Table S4A). Furthermore, we looked into the SNP associated with 375 epitopes abundances of HCV genotype 2 and 3. We found that the CC allele is associated with a decreased abundance of core epitopes but an increased abundance of NS5B epitopes in the HCV genome (Figure S4A; Table S4B), consistent with a recent study (Ansari et al., 2017Ansari M.A. Pedergnana V. L C Ip C. Magri A. Von Delft A. Bonsall D. Chaturvedi N. Bartha I. Smith D.

Genet. 2017; 49: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To assess VES-associated SNPs, HCC and PC groups were combined and then divided into two groups based on dichotomization of VES scores. In the associated quantile-quantile plots (Figure S5B), a wider spread with small differences in allele frequencies was evident with increased slope of the line. Principal-component analysis based on genotyping revealed differences in ethnicity (Figure S5C). Manhattan plot revealed significant SNPs between the high- and low-VES score groups (Figure 4A). Three SNPs, namely rs34725101, rs4483229, and rs16960234, located in three different genomic regions corresponding to the RHOA, EPB41L4B, and CDH13 loci, respectively, showed associations with VES score groups at the p value <10−7 significance level (Figure 4A; Table S4C). Among them, rs16960234 was further analyzed because both major and minor alleles of this variant could be detected in this cohort. We also found 127 SNPs with a high linkage disequilibrium (LD; r2 > 0.6) for rs16960234, but none for rs34725101 and rs4483229 (Figures 4B–4C; Table S4D). Seven of the high-LD SNPs of rs16960234 showed the expression profile of CDH13 as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) database (McKay et al., 2017McKay J.D.

The CDH13 expression levels in the artery tibial tissues from the carriers with risk G/G genotype of rs16960234 were significantly higher than the carriers with protective genotype A/A (Figure 4D). To obtain the genotypic effects of rs16960234 in HCC or AR, we generated logistic regression models to calculate the genotypic OR of this SNP in AR or HCC compared to PC (Figure 4E). The G/G genotype of rs16960234 showed an increase in risk of HCC in AR compared to PC, OR = 1.89 (95% CI 0.30–11.4), and the risk was higher and statistically significant for HCC, OR = 7.22 (95% CI 1.30–40.0) (Figure 4E; Table S4E). Consistent with the genotypic effect in HCC, the VES score also increased gradually from heterozygous A/G to G/G when compared with A/A (Figure 4F). Thus, rs16960234 and its linked gene, CDH13, may be associated with VES and contribute to disease risk.Figure S5CONSORT Flow Diagrams for NIDDK Cohort and Assessment of the Association of Clinical Outcomes with VES in NIDDK Cohort, Related to Figures 1 and 5, and NIDDK Cohort, Viral Feature Level, Clinical Outcome, and ROC Curve in STAR MethodsShow full caption(A) The diagram includes detailed information on the excluded participants from initial enrollment, sample allocation with indicated criteria, follow-up, QC and final data analysis.

In this study, root architectural traits of 153 mungbean genotypes were compared under optimum and low phosphorus (P) conditions. Significant variations and medium to high heritability were observed for the root traits. Total root length was positively and significantly correlated with total root surface area, total root volume, total root tips and root forks under both optimum P (r = 0.95, r = 0.85, r = 0.68 and r = 0.82 respectively) and low P (r = 0.95, r = 0.82, r = 0.71 and r = 0.81 respectively). The magnitudes of the coefficient of variations were relatively higher for root forks, total root tips and total root volume. Total root length, total root surface area and total root volume were major contributors of variation and can be utilized for screening of P efficiency at the seedling stage. Released Indian mungbean varieties were found to be superior for root traits than other genotypic groups. Based on comprehensive P efficiency measurement, IPM-288, TM 96-25, TM 96-2, M 1477, PUSA 1342 were found to be the best highly efficient genotypes, whereas M 1131, PS-16, Pusa Vishal, M 831, IC 325828 were highly inefficient. Highly efficient genotypes identified would be valuable genetic resources for P efficiency for utilizing in the mungbean breeding programme."

The results show that the improvement of the effectiveness of internal control has a significant promoting effect on innovation performance, and promotes enterprises to strengthen CSR performance. Meanwhile, CSR activities take a significant intermediary effect in the process of improving innovation performance through internal control. Finally, it is suggested that state-owned enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises should communicate and cooperate, strengthen the construction of internal control system, and improve innovation performance and CSR practices. Furthermore, the intermediary effect of CSR activities in the process of improving innovation performance through internal control should be brought into play, so as to return the expectations and demands of stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W3035093695,"Metformin, an anti-diabetes drug, has been recently emerging as a potential “anti-aging” intervention based on its reported beneficial actions against aging in preclinical studies. Nonetheless, very few metformin studies using mice have determined metformin concentrations and many effects of metformin have been observed in preclinical studies using doses/concentrations that were not relevant to therapeutic levels in human. We developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry protocol for metformin measurement in plasma, liver, brain, kidney, and muscle of mice. Young adult male and female C57BL/6 mice were voluntarily treated with metformin of 4 mg/ml in drinking water which translated to the maximum dose of 2.5 g/day in humans. A clinically relevant steady-state plasma metformin concentrations were achieved at 7 and 30 days after treatment in male and female mice. Metformin concentrations were slightly higher in muscle than in plasma, while, ~3 and 6-fold higher in the liver and kidney than in plasma, respectively. Low metformin concentration was found in the brain at ~20% of the plasma level. Furthermore, gender difference in steady-state metformin bio-distribution was observed. Our study established steady-state metformin levels in plasma, liver, muscle, kidney, and brain of normoglycemic mice treated with a clinically relevant dose, providing insight into future metformin preclinical studies for potential clinical translation."

The TMEM106B haplotype is known to influence the accumulation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy, and the haplotype's large-scale transcriptomic effects include the dysregulation of lysosomal genes and alterations in synaptic gene splicing that are also seen in the pathophysiology of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Further, a variant near GRN, another TDP-43 proteinopathy susceptibility gene, shows concordant effects with the TMEM106B haplotype. Leveraging neuropathology data from the same participants, we also show that TMEM106B and APOE-amyloid-β effects converge to alter myelination and lysosomal gene expression, which then contributes to TDP-43 accumulation. These results advance our mechanistic understanding of the TMEM106B TDP-43 risk haplotype and uncover a transcriptional program that mediates the converging effects of APOE-amyloid-β and TMEM106B on TDP-43 aggregation in older adults.

Many common genetic variants regulate local (cis-) or distant (trans-) gene expressions, thereby contributing to phenotypic variability and disease risk (Albert and Kruglyak, 2015Albert F.W. Kruglyak L. The role of regulatory variation in complex traits and disease.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Genetic regulation of local gene expression has been extensively studied, and numerous cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) have been identified from multiple human tissues (Albert and Kruglyak, 2015Albert F.W.

However, genetic factors that determine distant gene expression (trans-eQTLs)—which are more tissue and context specific—are not as well characterized because their discovery is hampered by the extensive multiple testing burden to consider millions of variants against more than ten thousand transcripts in the context of tissue-specific functions and diseases (Albert and Kruglyak, 2015Albert F.W.

This methodological limitation is especially problematic for tissues with limited sample access and extensive heterogeneity, such as the aging human brain tissue that is usually only available through autopsy and is affected by multiple and frequently coexisting neuropathologic changes, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular brain injury (VBI), Lewy bodies, and limbic-predominant age-related TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) encephalopathy neuropathological change (LATE-NC), that alone or in combination cause dementia (Kapasi et al., 2017Kapasi A.

Here, to overcome methodological challenges in genome-wide assessments of trans-eQTLs, we focused on the fact that trans-eQTLs often regulate expression of multiple biologically related genes (Albert and Kruglyak, 2015Albert F.W.

Such co-regulated transcriptional programs can be captured as groups of co-expressed genes that fluctuate in synchrony across individuals (Mostafavi et al., 2018Mostafavi S. Gaiteri C. Sullivan S.E.

Systems biology and gene networks in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16: 441-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which we refer to as “modules.” This modular structure of the transcriptome can be leveraged for dimensionality reduction: instead of performing trans-eQTL genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for each gene, we aimed to identify “module-quantitative trait loci (modQTL)” that regulate the average expression of the genes found in the gene co-expression modules. We utilized two community-based prospective cohorts of older adults with brain autopsies as a primary (discovery) dataset and a brain bank-based case-control study as a replication dataset. We performed a GWAS to identify and replicate modQTLs in the aging human cerebral cortex. Then, we performed detailed characterization of these modQTLs by using gene expression, RNA splicing, neuropathology, and cognitive data from each individual to elaborate the causal chain of events linking the genetics of gene expression to late-life dementia. The primary (discovery) dataset was assembled from deceased participants in either the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), two community-based cohorts of older adults that capture a continuous spectrum of pathology and cognition found in aging and dementia (n = 494, 62% female, median age at death = 88.8 years; Table S1) (Bennett et al., 2018Bennett D.A.

We first performed 47 independent GWASs in the primary dataset, one for the average expression of each of the 47 non-overlapping dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) co-expression modules derived from the same dataset (Mostafavi et al., 2018Mostafavi S.

In the primary analysis, we identified two loci with a significant modQTL effect (significance threshold for 47 GWAS, p < 1.1 × 10−9): (1) a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block that contains only the TMEM106B gene where a haplotype tagged by rs1990622A (ROSMAP allele frequency [AF] 0.55) was associated with expression of four different modules and (2) an intronic allele within RBFOX1 (rs78930980G; ROSMAP AF 0.02) that was associated with the expression of another module (Figure 1 and Table 1; see Table S3 for the full list of module Gene Ontology [GO] term enrichments). In addition, there were 11 suggestive modQTLs (1.1 × 10−9 < p < 5.0 × 10−8), two of which are also influenced by the same TMEM106B locus (Table S4).

The effects of both the TMEM106B and the RBFOX1 loci, with the exception of the rs1990622-module 110 (m110) association, were replicated in the Mayo RNAseq temporal cortex (TCX) dataset (replication 1; Table 1), using the same module membership definitions as the primary dataset. We observed largely consistent modQTL associations across these studies, despite important differences in study designs of ROSMAP (prospective cohort studies; DLPFC) and the Mayo RNAseq study (a case-control study; TCX). Post-hoc analyses of the Mayo RNAseq study data adjusting for participants' diagnosis did not significantly change the results (Table S5). In addition, three out of four TMEM106B modQTL associations were replicated in an independent subset of ROSMAP participants who were not part of the primary analysis (replication 2; Table 1), using the same module definition. We could not assess the RBFOX1 locus with lower AF in replication 2, given the dataset’s limited sample size. Of note, each of the primary, replication 1, and replication 2 datasets used a different data processing pipeline, showing that our results are robust to the choice of aligning software and the version of reference genome used in data pre-processing. The TMEM106B modQTL captures an already well-known pleiotropic locus of great clinical importance.

Neurodegener. 2018; 13: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). By contrast, the RBFOX1 modQTL has no previously reported trait associations and is neither a cis-eQTL of RBFOX1 (p = 0.77)—which is the only coding gene within ±1 Mb from the modQTL—nor in LD with any coding variants. Nonetheless, RBFOX1 is a major regulator of splicing and cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism in neurons and has been implicated in neurodevelopment and multiple neuropsychiatric disorders (Gandal et al., 2018Gandal M.J.

We performed further characterization of these modQTLs in the primary dataset (ROSMAP). The TMEM106B modQTL had a dominant effect on module levels (Figures 2A and S3A), and most of this dominant effect was not moderated or mediated by TMEM106B expression (Figures 2B, S3B, and S4 and Table S6). Furthermore, the average expression of a module that includes TMEM106B (m121) had a much weaker association with rs1990622A (β = 5.1 × 10−3, 95% CI = 1.8 × 10−3 to 8.4 × 10−3, p = 2.3 × 10−3) despite the module’s tight correlation with TMEM106B expression (Pearson’s r = 0.82, p < 2.2 × 10−16). These observations elucidate the main functional mechanism of this clinically important haplotype: the allele has a dominant effect on the aging brain’s transcriptome, and this effect is not dependent on TMEM106B mRNA level, suggesting that an allele of a coding variant rs3173615C (TMEM106B p.S185T; D' [coefficient of linkage disequilibrium] = 1, r2 = 0.98 with rs1990622A) on this haplotype could have a functional role (Nicholson et al., 2013Nicholson A.M.

This research was performed to determine the survival of E. coli O157 in autoclaved and natural (unautoclaved) sandy soils. Soils were inoculated with three different E. coli O157 strains (stx1+/stx2+, stx1-/stx2-, and stx1-/stx2+), and enumerated until extinction at 30°C. There was a significant difference in the survival of E. coli O157 based on soil treatment (autoclaved versus natural) at 30°C on days 1 (P = 0.00022), 3, (P = 2.53e-14), 7 (P = 5.59e-16), 14 (P = 1.072e-12), 30 (P = 7.18e-9), and 56 (P = 0.00029), with greater survival in autoclaved soils. The time to extinction (two consecutive negative enrichments) for all three strains was 169 and 84 days for autoclaved and natural soils, respectively. A separate E. coli O157 trial supplemented with 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the soil microbiome was performed at 15°C and 30°C on days 0, 7, 14, and 28 for each soil treatment. Greater species richness (Chao1, P = 2.2e-16) and diversity (Shannon, P = 2.2e-16) was observed in natural soils in comparison with autoclaved soils. Weighted UniFrac (beta-diversity) showed a clear distinction between soil treatments (P = 0.001). The greatest reduction of E. coli O157 was observed in natural soils at 30°C, and several bacterial taxa positively correlated (relative abundance) with time (day 0 to 28) in these soils (P < 0.05), suggesting that the presence of those bacteria might cause the reduction of E. coli O157. Taken together, a clear distinction in E. coli O157 survival, was observed between autoclaved and natural soils along with corresponding differences in microbial diversity in soil treatments. This research provides further insights into the bacterial taxa that may influence E. coli O157 in soils."
https://openalex.org/W3034878304,"Drug repurposing is an attractive and pragmatic way offering reduced risks and development time in the complicated process of drug discovery. In the past, drug repurposing has been largely accidental and serendipitous. The most successful examples so far have not involved a systematic approach. Nowadays, remarkable advances in drugs, diseases and bioinformatic knowledge are offering great opportunities for designing novel drug repurposing approach through comprehensive understanding of drug information. In this study, we introduced a novel drug repurposing approach based on transcriptomic data and chemical structures using deep learning. One strong candidate for repurposing has been identified. Pimozide is an anti-dyskinesia agent that is used for the suppression of motor and phonic tics in patients with Tourette’s Disorder. However, our pipeline proposed it as a strong candidate for treating non-small cell lung cancer. The cytotoxicity of pimozide against A549 cell lines has been validated."

However, the culture method for highly-quantified hepatocytes has not yet been established. Herein, we have developed an encapsulation and 3D cultivation method for iPSC-hepatocytes in core-shell hydrogel microfibers (a.k.a. cell fiber). In the fiber-shaped 3D microenvironment consisting of abundant extracellular matrix (ECM), the iPSC-hepatocytes exhibited many hepatic characteristics, including the albumin secretion, and the expression of the hepatic marker genes (ALB, HNF4α, ASGPR1, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4). Furthermore, we found that the fibers were mechanically stable and can be applicable to hepatocyte transplantation. Three days after transplantation of the microfibers into the abdominal cavity of immunodeficient mice, human albumin was detected in the peripheral blood of the transplanted mice. These results indicate that the iPSC-hepatocyte fibers are promising either as in vitro models for drug screening or as implantation grafts to treat liver failure."
https://openalex.org/W3035609961,"Developing new food products is a complex process. Even if a company performs new product development activities successfully, it is still uncertain if consumers will adopt the product. The Bass diffusion model has often been used to study product adoption. However, existing modifications of the Bass diffusion model do not capture the complexity of consumer food choice and they have limitations in situations where there is no sales data. To avoid these challenges, the system dynamics approach can be employed. This paper aimed at extending the existing system dynamics Bass diffusion model to investigate the dynamic adoption process of insect-based food from a consumer research perspective. We performed a structured review of the literature on edible insects to build the model. The model was used to study adoption of the product amongst consumers in the Netherlands. Simulations revealed that diffusion of a radical innovation, such as an insect-based burger, can proceed for many years before there are observable adopters in the total population, under the currently reported practices in the Netherlands. Expanding awareness of this innovation requires many decades, which can be quickened by developing strategies aimed at increasing word-of-mouth. Nevertheless, the low likelihood to adopt such food remains a challenge towards full adoption, even when the sensory quality of products is improved. To fully explore how to improve the diffusion outcome of edible insects, more knowledge on mechanisms related to positive and negative word-of-mouth, and adoption of insect-based burgers by people who initially reject them, is needed. Our study demonstrated that system dynamics models could have potential in designing new food product strategies in companies, as they facilitate decision-making and uncover knowledge gaps."
https://openalex.org/W4239461548,"Fungicide use in the United States to manage soybean diseases has increased in recent years. The ability of fungicides to reduce disease-associated yield losses varies greatly depending on multiple factors. Nonetheless, historical data are useful to understand the broad sense and long-term trends related to fungicide use practices. In the current study, the relationship between estimated soybean yield losses due to selected foliar diseases and foliar fungicide use was investigated using annual data from 28 soybean growing states over the period of 2005 to 2015. For national and regional (southern and northern United States) scale data, mixed effects modeling was performed considering fungicide use as a fixed and state and year as random factors to generate generalized R2 values for marginal (R2GLMM(m); contains only fixed effects) and conditional (R2GLMM(c); contains fixed and random effects) models. Similar analyses were performed considering soybean production data to see how fungicide use affected production. Analyses at both national and regional scales showed that R2GLMM(m) values were significantly smaller compared to R2GLMM(c) values. The large difference between R2 values for conditional and marginal models indicated that the variation of yield loss as well as production were predominantly explained by the state and year rather than the fungicide use, revealing the general lack of fit between fungicide use and yield loss/production at national and regional scales. Therefore, regression models were fitted across states and years to examine their importance in combination with fungicide use on yield loss or yield. In the majority of cases, the relationship was nonsignificant. However, the relationship between soybean yield and fungicide use was significant and positive for majority of the years in the study. Results suggest that foliar fungicides conferred yield benefits in most of the years in the study. Furthermore, the year-dependent usefulness of foliar fungicides in mitigating soybean yield losses suggested the possible influence of temporally fluctuating abiotic factors on the effectiveness of foliar fungicides and/or target disease occurrence and associated loss magnitudes."
https://openalex.org/W3034245077,"Introduction As total health and dental care expenditures in the United States continue to rise, healthcare disparities for low to middle-income Americans creates an imperative to analyze existing expenditures. This study examined health and dental care expenditures in the United States from 1996 to 2016 and explored trends in spending across various population subgroups. Methods Using data collected by the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, this study examined health and dental care expenditures in the United States from 1996 to 2016. Trends in spending were displayed graphically and spending across subgroups examined. All expenditures were adjusted for inflation or deflation to the 2016 dollar. Results Both total health and dental expenditures increased between 1996 and 2016 with total healthcare expenditures increasing from $838.33 billion in 1996 to $1.62 trillion in 2016, a 1.9-fold increase. Despite an overall increase, total expenditures slowed between 2004 and 2012 with the exception of the older adult population. Over the study period, expenditures increased across all groups with the greatest increases seen in older adult health and dental care. The per capita geriatric dental care expenditure increased 59% while the per capita geriatric healthcare expenditure increased 50% across the two decades. For the overall US population, the per capita dental care expenditure increased 27% while the per capita healthcare expenditure increased 60% over the two decades. All groups except the uninsured experienced increased dental care expenditure over the study period. Conclusions Healthcare spending is not inherently bad since it brings benefits while exacting costs. Our findings indicate that while there were increases in both health and dental care expenditures from 1996 to 2016, these increases were non-uniform both across population subgroups and time. Further research to understand these trends in detail will be helpful to develop strategies to address health and dental care disparities and to maximize resource utilization."

A novel approach describing VWF unfolding on the platelet surface under dynamic shear stress is proposed. Cumulative effect of dynamic shear on platelet activation via conformational changes of VWF is analysed. The critical condition of shear-induced platelet activation is formulated. The explicit expression for the threshold value of cumulative shear stress as a function of VWF multimer size is derived. The results open novel prospects for pharmacological regulation of shear-induced platelet activation through control of VWF multimers size distribution.
https://openalex.org/W3035443531,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based molecular profiling is rapidly gaining traction in clinical practice of advanced cancer patients with multi-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels. However, clinical outcomes remain poorly described and deserve further validation with personalized treatment of patients with genomic alterations detected in plasma ctDNA. Here, we describe the outcomes, disease control rate (DCR) at 3 months and progression-free survival (PFS) in oncogenic-addicted advanced NSCLC patients with actionable alterations identified in plasma by ctDNA liquid biopsy assay, InVisionFirst®-Lung. A pooled retrospective analysis was completed of 81 advanced NSCLC patients with all classes of alterations predicting response to current FDA approved drugs: sensitizing common EGFR mutations (78%, n = 63) with T790M (73%, 46/63), ALK / ROS1 gene fusions (17%, n = 14) and BRAF V600E mutations (5%, n = 4). Actionable driver alterations detected in liquid biopsy were confirmed by prior tissue genomic profiling in all patients, and all patients received personalized treatment. Of 82 patients treated with matched targeted therapies, 10% were at first-line, 41% at second-line, and 49% beyond second-line. Acquired T790M at TKI relapse was detected in 73% (46/63) of patients, and all prospective patients (34/46) initiated osimertinib treatment based on ctDNA results. The 3-month DCR was 86% in 81 evaluable patients. The median PFS was of 14.8 months (12.1-22.9m). Baseline ctDNA allelic fraction of genomic driver did not correlate with the response rate of personalized treatment (p = 0.29). ctDNA molecular profiling is an accurate and reliable tool for the detection of clinically relevant molecular alterations in advanced NSCLC patients. Clinical outcomes with targeted therapies endorse the use of liquid biopsy by amplicon-based NGS ctDNA analysis in first line and relapse testing for advanced NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3034692437,"Introduction Ethiopia is one of the Sub-Saharan African countries with high unintended pregnancy rate. Every woman in Ethiopia experiences at least one unintended birth. Although there were some studies about contraceptive use among all women in Ethiopia, evidence about contraceptive use among women with no fertility intention was limited. Therefore, this analysis was performed to assess the prevalence of contraceptive use and associated factors among fecund, married reproductive-age women who intended no more children. Methods We used the 2016 Ethiopian Demography and Health Survey (EDHS) data collected through a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. EDHS was a community based, cross-sectional study conducted from January 18, 2016, to June 27, 2016. A total of 2,859 fecund married reproductive age women with no desire to have more children were included in this study. Both descriptive and logistic regression analysis were performed using STATA V.14. A 95% confidence interval was used to declare statistical significance. Results Contraceptive use among fecund married reproductive-age women who want no more children was 51.1% (95%CI: 47.0–55.24%). Visit by health workers at home (AOR = 1.37, 95%CI: 1.02, 1.83), living in Addis Ababa (AOR = 3.38 95%CI: 1.76, 6.37) and having better wealth index (middle (AOR = 1.76, 95%CI: 1.25, 2.47) and being rich (AOR = 1.96, 95%CI: 1.40, 2.74)) were found positively associated with contraceptive use. On the other hand, living in the Somali region (AOR = 0.10, 95%CI: 0.01, 0.85), and being Muslim (AOR = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.30, 0.67) were found negatively associated with contraceptive use. Conclusion Contraceptive use among fecund married reproductive-age women with no fertility intention was low compared to their demand. Therefore, to improve contraceptive use, the provision of family planning counseling and information should be strengthened. Further intervention is needed to narrow disparities in contraceptive use among regions and different population groups."
https://openalex.org/W3035384166,"Soil aggregation is closely related to the soil organic carbon sequestration, both of which plays an important role in the stability of the soil carbon pool. However, the results of the impact of yak grazing intensity on the soil carbon process in alpine meadows have been unclear. With the marsh meadow as the research object in the Gahai wetland of the east Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we analyzed the influence of different grazing intensities on the allocation of mass, stability and aggregate-associated organic carbon content of aggregates in the surface soil (0-20cm) of pasture by the Le Bissonnais method. The results showed that the mass of aggregates in the particle size class of > 0.2-mm was the highest among the pastures with different grazing intensities. Compared with the no grazing grassland, light grazing promoted the formation of macro aggregates in the particle size class of > 1-mm and improved the stability of soil aggregates. The degree of soil agglomerations and stability of aggregates decreased, and the macro aggregates gradually transformed into micro aggregates (< 0.05-mm class) in moderately and heavily grazed pastures. The > 2-mm and < 0.05-mm classes of particle size had a strong fixation effect on organic carbon. Light grazing promoted the accumulation of organic carbon in this particle size aggregate, and moderate and heavy grazing accelerated the decomposition of organic carbon. There was no significant difference in organic carbon in other particle size aggregates among different grasslands (P > 0.05). This result shows that light grazing, which is a reasonable yak grazing intensity in the study area, is conducive to the formation of a good soil structure in the area and improves the soil carbon sequestration capacity."

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of dry preservation of human plasma, using sugars as lyoprotectants, and evaluate macromolecular stability of plasma components during storage. Blood plasma from healthy donors was freeze dried using 0−10% glucose, sucrose, or trehalose, and stored at various temperatures. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure the glass transition temperatures of freeze-dried samples. Protein aggregation, the overall protein secondary structure, and oxidative damage were studied under different storage conditions. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements showed that plasma freeze-dried with glucose, sucrose and trehalose have glass transition temperatures of respectively 72±3.4°C, 46±11°C, 15±2.4°C. It was found that sugars diminish freeze-drying induced protein aggregation in a dose-dependent manner, and that a 10% (w/v) sugar concentration almost entirely prevents protein aggregation. Protein aggregation after rehydration coincided with relatively high contents of β-sheet structures in the dried state. Trehalose reduced the rate of protein aggregation during storage at elevated temperatures, and plasma that is freeze- dried plasma with trehalose showed a reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and protein oxidation products during storage. In conclusion, freeze-drying plasma with trehalose provides an attractive alternative to traditional cryogenic preservation."

This study aimed to compare the fasting lipid profile of regular kratom users to that of healthy subjects who do not use kratom. It also determined the association between various characteristics of kratom users and the serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels of regular kratom users. Methods A total of 200 participants (n = 100 kratom users and n = 100 healthy subjects who do not use kratom) were recruited for this analytical cross-sectional study. Data on sociodemographic status, kratom use characteristics, cigarette smoking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), fasting serum lipid profile, and liver function were collected from all participants. Results The liver parameters of the study participants were within normal range. The serum total cholesterol and LDL of kratom users were significantly lower than those of healthy subjects who do not use kratom. There were no significant differences in the serum triglyceride and HDL levels. However, higher average daily frequency of kratom use and increasing age were associated with increased serum total cholesterol among kratom users. Other kratom use characteristics such as age of first kratom intake, duration of kratom use, and quantity of daily kratom intake were not associated with increased serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL levels. Conclusions Our findings suggest regular kratom consumption was not linked to elevated serum lipids, except when there is a higher frequency of daily kratom intake. However, the study was limited by the small sample size, and hence a more comprehensive study with larger sample size is warranted to confirm the findings."
https://openalex.org/W3035037506,"Background The expanded provision of professional services by community pharmacists in the primary care setting encompasses the necessity to communicate and collaborate with other health professionals. Little is currently known about contemporary processes employed for their achievement. Objective To explore contemporary processes employed for effective communication and collaboration between primary care pharmacists and health professionals. Methods In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with pharmacists practising in primary care settings requiring varying expertise, practice experience and speciality backgrounds. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and coded using NVivo version 11. Data were analysed following an inductive approach to facilitate thematic analysis. Results Twenty-six pharmacists were interviewed, which achieved data saturation. Five overarching themes emerged as participants described their experiences and perspectives regarding processes employed for communication and collaboration: i) tailored means of communication, ii) referral processes, iii) facilitators for effective interactions, iv) barriers to effective interactions, and v) implementation of a national digital health record. Participants acknowledged that the changing landscape of the Australian health system affected communication and collaboration with other health professionals. The changes resulted in participants’ acceptance of a multidisciplinary approach to healthcare, which was contingent upon effective communication, interactions and relationships with other health professionals. Varying levels of formality and characteristics of referrals were identified, however the nature of the communication was tailored to the individual scenario or circumstance that was considered appropriate. Conclusions Pharmacists exercised judgment on a case-by-case basis when tailoring the means of communication. The establishment of a consistent and structured two-way referral process between health professionals within the primary care setting is important, which includes use of the national digital health record. Increased awareness and appreciation of each health professional’s roles and expertise would further enhance inter-professional collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W3035273478,"In many objective optimization problems (MaOPs), more than three distinct objectives are optimized. The challenging part in MaOPs is to get the Pareto approximation (PA) with high diversity and good convergence. In Literature, in order to solve the issue of diversity and convergence in MaOPs, many approaches are proposed using different multi objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Moreover, to get better results, the researchers use the sets of reference points to differentiate the solutions and to model the search process, it further evaluates and selects the non-dominating solutions by using the reference set of solutions. Furthermore, this technique is used in some of the swarm-based evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we have used some effective adaptations of bat algorithm with the previous mentioned approach to effectively handle the many objective problems. Moreover, we have called this algorithm as many objective bat algorithm (MaOBAT). This algorithm is a biologically inspired algorithm, which uses echolocation power of micro bats. Each bat represents a complete solution, which can be evaluated based on the problem specific fitness function and then based on the dominance relationship, non-dominated solutions are selected. In proposed MaOBAT, dominance rank is used as dominance relationship (dominance rank of a solution means by how many other solutions a solution dominated). In our proposed strategy, dynamically allocated set of reference points are used, allowing the algorithm to have good convergence and high diversity pareto fronts (PF). The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages over several state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the quality of the solution."
https://openalex.org/W3035701985,"Background We evaluated whether a simulation-based training with a vessel phantom improves the basic skills of a novice required for ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation in real patients. In addition, we analysed whether repeated simulation training sets with an inter-training interval would accelerate the learning curve. Methods From March 2019 to July 2019, twenty-one anesthesiology residents were randomized into either a simulation group (n = 11) or control group (n = 10). Residents performed a total of 84 ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulations in real patients. The simulation group participated in two sets of simulation training on a vessel phantom (10 sessions per set) with a one-month inter-training interval. Trainee’s performance proficiency was scored using a developed checklist, and a learning curve for each training set was constructed. To evaluate the effectiveness of our training curriculum in skill transfer, each resident performed four ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulations in real patients. The primary outcome was first attempt success rate and the secondary outcome was dynamic needle-tip positioning ability in real patients. Results The first attempt success rate and dynamic needle-tip positioning ability by ultrasound transducer were significantly higher in the simulation group than the control group (81.8% vs. 50%, P = 0.002 and 68.2% vs. 7.5%, P < 0.001, respectively). A reduced number of sessions was required to reach a plateau score on the learning curve in the repeated training set compared in the first-set (7 (5–8) vs. 3 (2–4), P = 0.003, respectively). Conclusions Simulation-based training using a vessel phantom effectively improved the first attempt success rate for ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation in real patients and the dynamic needle-tip positioning ability by ultrasound transducer in novice anesthesiology residents. In addition, repeated training curriculum accelerated the learning curve for recall skill proficiency and reduced inter-individual variability for skill acquisition.

https://openalex.org/W3034176022,"As rice is an important staple food globally, research for development and enhancement of its nutritional value it is an imperative task. Identification of nutrient enriched rice germplasm and exploiting them for breeding programme is the easiest way to develop better quality rice. In this study, we analyzed 113 aromatic rice germplasm in order to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) underpinning nutrition components and determined by measuring the normal frequency distribution for Fe, Zn, amylose, and protein content in those rice germplasm. Comparatively, the germplasm Radhuni pagal, Kalobakri, Thakurbhog (26.6 ppm) and Hatisail exhibited the highest mean values for Fe (16.9 ppm), Zn (34.1 ppm), amylose (26.6 ppm) and protein content (11.0 ppm), respectively. Moreover, a significant linear relationship (R2 = 0.693) was observed between Fe and Zn contents. Cluster analysis based on Mahalanobis D2 distances revealed four major clusters of 113 rice germplasm, with cluster III containing a maximum 37 germplasm and a maximum inter-cluster distance between clusters III and IV. The 45 polymorphic SSRs and four trait associations exhibited eight significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) located on eight different chromosomes using composite interval mapping (CIM). The highly significant QTL (variance 7.89%, LOD 2.02) for protein content (QTL.pro.1) was observed on chromosome 1 at 94.9cM position. Also, four QTLs for amylose content were observed with the highly significant QTL.amy.8 located on chromosome 8 exhibiting 7.2% variance with LOD 1.83. Only one QTL (QTL.Fe.9) for Fe content was located on chromosome 9 (LOD 1.24), and two (QTL.Zn.4 and QTL.Zn.5) for Zn on chromosome 4 (LOD 1.71) and 5 (LOD 1.18), respectively. Overall, germplasm from clusters III and IV might offer higher heterotic response with the identified QTLs playing a significant role in any rice biofortification breeding program and released with development of new varieties."
https://openalex.org/W3034413481,"Introduction Hypertension is the leading cause of death and disability in adult populations globally. Its prevalence is increasing rapidly in Ethiopia. Studies conducted to date address different population categories. However, there is lack of data on the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among civil servants working in various sectors and levels. Objective To assess the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among civil servants in Sidama Zone, south Ethiopia. Methods and materials An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 1–30, 2019 on a sample of 546 civil servants selected randomly from different departments of Sidama Zone Administration. Data were collected using structured, face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire and standard physical measurements. The data were entered using Epi Data 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with hypertension. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed to assess the presence and strength of associations. Results A total of 546 civil servants responded resulting in a response rate of 94.9%. The prevalence of hypertension was 24.5% [95% CI: 23.3% - 25.6%]. The identified risk factors of hypertension were male sex (AOR 4.31[95% CI: 1.84–10.09]), moderate current alcohol consumption (AOR: 4.85; [95% CI: 1.73–13.61]), current khat chewing (AOR 2.97[95% CI: 1.38–6.40]), old age (AOR: 4.41[95% CI: 1.19–16.26]), being obese (AOR 5.94 [95% CI: 1.26–27.86]) and central obesity (AOR 3.57 [95% CI: 1.80–7.07]). Conclusions One in four civil servants are hypertensive. Different demographic, behavioral and metabolic factors increase the odds of hypertension among civil servants. Prevention and control of hypertension shall involve promotion of healthy lifestyles such as weight management, regular physical activity and quitting or cutting down on harmful use of substances such as alcohol and khat."
https://openalex.org/W3035190036,"Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is an important economic crop, supplying up to 80% of the table sugar and ~60% of bio-ethanol worldwide. Due to population growth and dwindling fossil-fuel reserves, the demand for sugar and bio-ethanol requires significant improvement in sugarcane production. Breeding sugarcane cultivars with high-performance agronomic traits is undoubtedly the most efficient way to achieve this goal. Therefore, evaluating agronomic traits and dissecting underlying loci are critically important for this aim steps in providing genetic resources and molecular markers for selection. In this study, we assembled a diversity panel of 236 elite sugarcane germplasms originally collected from 12 countries. We evaluated 28 agronomic traits in the diversity panel with three replicates. The diversity panel was genotyped using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, and a total of 1,359 markers were generated. Through the genome-wide association study, we identified three markers significantly associated with three traits evaluated at a stringent threshold (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). The genotypes of the three associated markers grouped respective trait values into two distinct groups, supporting the reliability of these markers for breeding selection. Our study provides putative molecular markers linked to agronomic traits for breeding robust sugarcane cultivars. Additionally, this study emphasized the importance of sugarcane germplasm introduced from other countries and suggested that the use of these germplasms in breeding programs depends on local industrial needs."
https://openalex.org/W3034644303,"Artificial gravity elicited through short-arm human centrifugation combined with physical exercise, such as jumping, is promising in maintaining health and performance during space travel. However, motion sickness symptoms could limit the tolerability of the approach. Therefore, we determined the feasibility and tolerability, particularly occurrence of motion sickness symptoms, during reactive jumping exercises on a short-arm centrifuge. In 15 healthy men, we assessed motion sickness induced by jumping exercises during short-arm centrifugation at constant +1Gz or randomized variable +0.5, +0.75, +1, +1.25 and +1.5 Gz along the body axis referenced to center of mass. Jumping in the upright position served as control intervention. Test sessions were conducted on separate days in a randomized and cross-over fashion. All participants tolerated jumping exercises against terrestrial gravity and on the short-arm centrifuge during 1 Gz or variable Gz at the center of mass without disabling motion sickness symptoms. While head movements markedly differed, motion sickness scores were only modestly increased with jumping on the short-arm centrifuge compared with vertical jumps. Our study demonstrates that repetitive jumping exercises are feasible and tolerable during short-arm centrifugation. Since jumping exercises maintain muscle and bone mass, our study enables further development of exercise countermeasures in artificial gravity."
https://openalex.org/W3035187202,"Bacteriophages (phages) play a key role in shaping microbial communities, including those of the human body. Phages are abundant members of the urogenital tract, most often persisting through the lysogenic life cycle as prophages integrated within the genomes of their bacterial hosts. While numerous studies of the urogenital microbiota have focused on the most abundant bacterial member of this niche–Lactobacillus species–very little is known about Lactobacillus phages. Focusing on Lactobacillus jensenii strains from the urinary tract, we identified numerous prophages related to the previously characterized Lv-1 phage from a vaginal L. jensenii strain. Furthermore, we identified a new L. jensenii phage, Lu-1. Evidence suggests that both phages are abundant within the urogenital tract. CRISPR spacer sequences matching to Lv-1 and Lu-1 prophages were identified. While first detected in urinary isolates, the Lu-1 phage was also discovered in L. jensenii isolates from vaginal and perineal swabs, and both phages were found in metagenomic data sets. The prevalence of these phages in the isolates suggests that both phages are active members of the urogenital microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3035750521,"Avian pox is a viral disease documented in a wide range of bird species. Disease-related detrimental effects can cause dyspnea and dysphagia, and birds with high metabolic requirements, such as hummingbirds, are thus especially vulnerable to the pathogen. Hummingbirds have a strong presence in California, especially in urban environments. However, little is understood regarding the impact of pox virus on hummingbird populations. Currently, diagnosing a pox infection relies on obtaining a tissue biopsy, which poses significant risks to birds and challenges in the field. Understanding the ecology of hummingbird pox viral infections could be advanced by a minimally invasive ante-mortem diagnostic method. Our aim was to address whether pox infections can be diagnosed using integumentary system samples besides tissue biopsies. To meet this goal, we tested multiple integumentary sample types using a quantitative real-time PCR assay. A secondary study goal was to determine which sample types (ranging from minimally to highly invasive sampling) were optimal for identifying infected birds.Pox-like lesion tissue, pectoral muscle, feathers, toenail clippings, blood, and swabs (both pox-like lesion tissue and non pox-like lesion tissue) were taken from live birds and carcasses of two species of hummingbirds found in California. To maximize successful diagnosis, especially for samples with low viral load, a real-time quantitative PCR assay was developed for detecting the hummingbird-specific Avipoxvirus 4b core protein gene. Avipoxvirus DNA was successfully amplified from all sample types obtained from 27 individuals. These results were compared to those of conventional PCR and comparisons were also made among sample types, utilizing lesion tissue samples as the gold standard.Hummingbird avian pox can be diagnosed without relying on tissue biopsies. We identify that feather samples, of which contour feathers yielded the best results, can be used for diagnosing infected birds, thus reducing sampling risk. In sum, the real-time PCR assay detected viral DNA in various integumentary system sample types and will be useful in future studies of hummingbird disease ecology."
https://openalex.org/W3034181685,"Creativity is pivotal to solving complex problems of many kinds, yet how cognitive flexibility dynamically supports creative processes is largely unexplored. Despite being a crucial multi-faceted contributor in creative thinking, cognitive flexibility, as typically assessed, does not fully capture how people adaptively shift between varying or persisting in their current problem-solving efforts. To fill this theoretical and methodological gap, we introduce a new operationalization of cognitive flexibility: the process-based Self-Guided Transition (SGT) measures, which assess when participants autonomously choose to continue working on one of two concurrently presented items (dwell length) and how often they choose to switch between the two items (shift count). We examine how these measures correlate with three diverse creativity tasks, and with creative performance on a more complex ""garden design"" task. Analyses of the relations between these new cognitive flexibility measures in 66 young adults revealed that SGT dwell length positively correlated with creative performance across several tasks. The SGT shift count positively correlated with within-task performance for a two-item choice task tapping divergent thinking (Alternative Uses Task) but not for a two-item choice task calling on convergent thinking (Anagram task). Multiple regression analyses revealed that, taken together, both the shift count and dwell length measures from the Alternative Uses Task explained a significant proportion of variance in measures of fluency, and originality, on a composite measure of the three independently-assessed creative tasks. Relations of SGTs to the Garden Design task were weaker, though shift count on the Alternative Uses Task was predictive of a composite measure of overall Garden Design quality. Taken together, these results highlight the promise of our new process-based measures to better chart the dynamically flexible processes supporting creative thinking and action."
https://openalex.org/W3035314986,"Introduction Digital tools like 3D laser-based photonic scanners, which can assess external anthropometric measurements for population based studies, and predict body composition, are gaining in importance. Here we focus on a) systematic deviation between manually determined and scanned standard measurements, b) differences regarding the strength of association between these standard measurements and body composition, and c) improving these predictions of body composition by considering additional scan measurements. Methods We analysed 104 men aged 19–23. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis was used to estimate whole body fat mass, visceral fat mass and skeletal muscle mass (SMM). For the 3D body scans, an Anthroscan VITUSbodyscan was used to automatically obtain 90 body shape measurements. Manual anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist circumference) were also taken. Results Scanned and manually measured height, waist circumference, waist-to-height-ratio, and BMI were strongly correlated (Spearman Rho>0.96), however we also found systematic differences. When these variables were used to predict body fat or muscle mass, explained variation and prediction standard errors were similar between scanned and manual measurements. The univariable predictions performed well for both visceral fat (r2 up to 0.92) and absolute fat mass (AFM, r2 up to 0.87) but not for SMM (r2 up to 0.54). Of the 90 body scanner measures used in the multivariable prediction models, belly circumference and middle hip circumference were the most important predictors of body fat content. Stepwise forward model selection using the AIC criterion showed that the best predictive power (r2 up to 0.99) was achieved with models including 49 scanner measurements. Conclusion The use of a 3D full body scanner produced results that strongly correlate to manually measured anthropometric measures. Predictions were improved substantially by including multiple measurements, which can only be obtained with a 3D body scanner, in the models."
https://openalex.org/W3034324900,"Chagas disease is one of the main zoonoses mediated by vectors in America. The etiological agent is the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, transmitted mainly by hematophagous insects of the subfamily Triatominae. Mepraia species are triatomines endemic to Chile that play an important role in T. cruzi transmission in the wild cycle and are potential vectors for humans. In addition to the continental distribution, populations of Mepraia genus have been reported inhabiting islands of northern Chile. The presence of individuals of Mepraia in insular areas might be explained through passive dispersion by marine birds or by vicariance of an ancestral widespread population. To clarify the biogeographic origin and phylogenetic relationships of island individuals of Mepraia, mitochondrial COI and cyt b genes were sequenced in individuals from island and continental areas. Gene sequences were used to estimate phylogenetic relationships, divergence dates and migration rates between insular and continental populations. The dates of divergence estimates are congruent with sea level and tectonic changes that originated the islands during Pleistocene. Migration rates suggest symmetric historical island-continent gene flow. We suggest that the origin of island triatomines can be explained by both vicariance and dispersion. Phylogenetic relationships show that individuals from Santa María Island and the continent clustered in a clade different from those previously reported, indicating a new lineage of Mepraia genus. This study will contribute to understand the origin of the T. cruzi infection in coastal islands of northern Chile."
https://openalex.org/W3034467478,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STECs) contamination of produce, as a result of contact with ruminant fecal material, has been associated with serious foodborne illness. Bacteriophages (phages) that infect STECs have primarily been reported to be of cattle origin. However, they likely exist in other environments or in animals that share habitats with cattle, such as goats. To explore the presence and diversity of phages specific to STEC O157 and the top six non-O157 STECs in goat-associated environments, environmental samples consisting of feces (goat and cattle) and soil samples were collected monthly for six months from an organic produce farm. A variety of phages belonging to the Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Podoviridae families were isolated from all goat fecal and half of the soil samples. The most commonly isolated phages belonged to Myoviridae and were lytic against STEC O103. The isolated phages had different host ranges, but collectively, showed lytic activity against O157 and the top six non-O157 STEC strains excluding O121. Two non-O157 STECs (O174: H21 and O-antigen-negative: H18) were isolated from soil and cattle feces, respectively. Although prior studies have reported that goats shed STEC into the environment, the findings of the current study suggest that goat feces may also contain lytic STEC-specific phages. The phages of goat origin have the capacity to infect STECs implicated in causing foodborne outbreaks, making them potential candidates for biocontrol pending additional characterization steps. Further work is needed to determine if the addition of goats to the farm environment could potentially reduce the presence of STECs."
https://openalex.org/W3034851469,"Swallow-breathing coordination is influenced by changes in lung volume, which is modulated by feedback from both vagal and spinal sensory afferents. The purpose of this study was to manipulate feedback from these afferents, with and without a simultaneous mechanical challenge (chest compression), in order to assess the influence of each sensory pathway on swallow in rats. We hypothesized that manipulation of afferent feedback would shift the occurrence of swallow toward the inspiratory phase of breathing. Afferent feedback was perturbed by lidocaine nebulization, extra-thoracic vagotomy, or lidocaine administration to the pleural space in sodium pentobarbital anesthetized rats (N = 43). These different afferent perturbations were performed both in control conditions (no chest compression), and with chest compression. Manipulating pulmonary stretch receptor-mediated volume feedback in male animals decreased swallow occurrence. Female rats appear to rely more on spinal afferent feedback, as swallow occurrence shifted to late expiration with chest compression and vagotomy or lidocaine injections. Results suggest that sex-specific mechanisms modulate swallow-breathing coordination, and that vagal feedback is inhibitory to swallow-related muscles, while spinal feedback from pleural afferents has excitatory effects. This study supports the theory that a balance of vagal and spinal afferent feedback is necessary to maintain an optimal swallow pattern and swallow-breathing coordination."

Methods In this retrospective, consecutive interventional case series, 72 eyes of 72 patients who underwent DMEK were evaluated. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) were assessed at 12 months postoperatively. Multiple regression analysis was performed to assess parameters such as age, sex, axial length, preoperative visual acuity, re-bubbling, the ratio of graft to cornea area, iris damage scores, types of filling gases, air or SF6 volume in the anterior chamber (AC) on postoperative day 1, and ECD loss rates at 12 months postoperatively. Results BCVA improved significantly at 12 months after DMEK (P < .001). The rate of ECD loss at 12 months after DMEK was 54.4 ± 16.1%. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that a larger ratio of graft to corneal area (P = 0.0061) and higher donor ECD (P = 0.042) were the primary factors for a lower ECD loss rate at 12 months after DMEK. Conclusion A relatively larger graft size compared to the host cornea and more donor ECD might help endothelial survival in patients with BK. Moreover, for such patients, the surgeon should attempt to use a relatively larger graft size when performing DMEK, particularly in Asian eyes."
https://openalex.org/W3035660653,"Fearful facial expressions tend to be more salient than other expressions. This threat bias is to some extent driven by simple low-level image properties, rather than the high-level emotion interpretation of stimuli. It might be expected therefore that different expressions will, on average, have different physical contrasts. However, studies tend to normalise stimuli for RMS contrast, potentially removing a naturally-occurring difference in salience. We assessed whether images of faces differ in both physical and apparent contrast across expressions. We measured physical RMS contrast and the Fourier amplitude spectra of 5 emotional expressions prior to contrast normalisation. We also measured expression-related differences in perceived contrast. Fear expressions have a steeper Fourier amplitude slope compared to neutral and angry expressions, and consistently significantly lower contrast compared to other faces. This effect is more pronounced at higher spatial frequencies. With the exception of stimuli containing only low spatial frequencies, fear expressions appeared higher in contrast than a physically matched reference. These findings suggest that contrast normalisation artificially boosts the perceived salience of fear expressions; an effect that may account for perceptual biases observed for spatially filtered fear expressions."
https://openalex.org/W3034992151,"The identification of early markers of dementia is important for higher-risk populations such as those with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Retrotransposons, including long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) and Alu, comprise ~40% of the human genome. Although dysregulation of these retrotransposons can induce aberrant gene regulation and genomic instability, their role in the development of pre-symptomatic dementia (PSD) among T2D patients is unknown. Here, we examined locus-specific changes in LINE-1 and Alu methylation in PSD and the potential to offset these changes via supplementation with folate and vitamin B12. We interrogated DNA methylation patterns corresponding to 22,352 probes for LINE-1 and Alu elements using publicly-available Illumina Infinium 450K methylation datasets from i) an 18-month prospective study in 28 T2D patients (GSE62003) and ii) an intervention study in which 44 individuals were supplemented with folic acid (400 μg/day) and vitamin B12 (500 μg/day) over two years (GSE74548). We identified 714 differentially methylated positions (DMP) mapping to retrotransposons in T2D patients who developed PSD in comparison to those who did not (PFDR < 0.05), comprised of 2.4% (228 probes) of all LINE-1 probes and 3.8% (486 probes) of all Alu probes. These loci were enriched in genes with functions related to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline, including GNB5, GNG7 and PKN3 (p < 0.05). In older individuals supplemented with folate/vitamin B12, 85 (11.9%) PSD retrotransposon loci showed significant changes in methylation (p < 0.05): participants with the MTHFR CC genotype predominantly showed hypermethylation at these loci, while hypomethylation was observed more frequently in those with the TT genotype. In T2D patients, LINE-1 and Alu elements are differentially methylated in PSD in a locus-specific manner and may offer clinical utility in monitoring risk of dementia. Further work is required to examine the potential for dietary supplementation in lowering the risk of PSD."
https://openalex.org/W3035760074,"Objective Single vehicle run-off crashes in urban areas constitute a growing problem that deserves more attention from authorities and researchers. This study aims to detect geometric road design risk factors characterizing places where urban run-off crashes might happen. Methods A case-control study was performed in the urban area of Valladolid (Spain) with data corresponding to a four-year period. Logistic regression models were used to analyze data, considering different variables related to design parameters in the models: type of intersection, radius of curvature, width of the pavement, width of the traffic lane, number of lanes for traffic in the same direction, direction of the traffic, length of the previous straight section, distance to the previous traffic light, slope, and finally, priority regulation. Two different scenarios were investigated: intersections and curves. Results The Adjusted Odds-Ratio of a run-off crash was five times higher in double direction roads with median strip than in one-way urban roads, for both curves and intersections, and almost nine times higher on road sections with previous straight lengths greater than 500 meters. Specific risk factors for intersections are “number of lanes for traffic in the same direction” (the odds of a run-off crash are more than five times higher on a road with two or more lanes), “length of preceding straight section” (the odds on road sections with lengths greater than 500 meters are more than nine times that of road sections with a length of less than 150 meters). For curves, specific factors are “width of the traffic lane” (the odds of a run-off crash on curves with lanes wider than 3.75m are more than six times higher) and “priority regulation” (the odds of a run-off crash increases more than twelve times on road sections with traffic light regulation over those without any regulation). Conclusions The current study identifies urban road configurations that might require redesigning with the aim of decreasing the odds of a run-off crash, or the implementation of passive protective systems to mitigate their consequences. Specifically, intersections in two direction roads with median strip, more than two lanes per direction and a long preceding straight section, as well as curves with wide lanes and traffic light regulation, are the places that require attention."
https://openalex.org/W3034305766,"Brain function requires the flexible coordination of billions of neurons across multiple scales. This could be achieved by scale-free, critical dynamics balanced at the edge of order and disorder. Criticality has been demonstrated in several, often reduced neurophysiological model systems. In the intact human brain criticality has yet been only verified for the resting state. A more direct link between the concept of criticality and oscillatory brain physiology, which is strongly related to cognition, is yet missing. In the present study we therefore carried out a frequency-specific analysis of criticality in the MEG, recorded while subjects were in a defined cognitive state through mindfulness meditation. In a two-step approach we assessed whether the macroscopic neural avalanche dynamics is scale-free by evaluating the goodness of a power-law fits of cascade size and duration distributions of MEG deflections in different frequency bands. In a second step we determined the closeness of the power-law exponents to a critical value of -1.5. Power-law fitting was evaluated by permutation testing, fitting of alternative distributions, and cascade shape analysis. Criticality was verified by defined relationships of exponents of cascade size and duration distributions. Behavioral relevance of criticality was tested by correlation of indices of criticality with individual scores of the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. We found that relevant scale-free near-critical dynamics originated only from broad-band high-frequency (> 100 Hz) MEG activity, which has been associated with action potential firing, and therefore links criticality on the macroscopic level of MEG to critical spike avalanches on a microscopic level. Whereas a scale-free dynamics was found under mindfulness meditation and rest, avalanche dynamics shifted towards a critical point during meditation by reduction of neural noise. Together with our finding that during mindfulness meditation avalanches show differences in topography relative to rest, our results show that self-regulated attention as required during meditation can serve as a control parameter of criticality in scale-free brain dynamics."

Most species showed similar karyotypes regarding chromosome number (2n = 24) and morphology (FN = 48), excepting Phyllodytes edelmoi and Osteocephalus buckleyi with 2n = 22 (FN = 44) and 2n = 28 (FN = 50), respectively. The NOR location was variable among species and provided valuable phylogenetic information. This marker was located in pair 11 in all species of Trachycephalus, Itapotihyla langsdorffii, and Nyctimantis arapapa, representing the plesiomorphic condition of Lophyohylini. Besides, other apomorphic states were recovered for the clades comprising N. rugiceps and N. siemersi (NOR in pair 5), and Dryaderces pearsoni, Osteocephalus, and Osteopilus (NOR in pair 9). Phyllodytes presented variation for NORs position; they were in pair 2 in P. edelmoi, pair 7 in P. melanomystax, and pair 8 in P. gyrinaethes and P. praeceptor. Polymorphisms in size, number, and activity of this marker were observed for N. siemersi, Osteocephalus fuscifacies, and some species of Trachycephalus. Remarkably, in N. siemersi NORs were detected on a single chromosome in the two specimens studied by this technique, raising the question of how this complex polymorphism is maintained. Interstitial telomeric sequences were found in P. edelmoi, P. melanomystax, and Osteocephalus buckleyi, and their presence seems to be not related to the chromosome reorganization events. Finally, some species showed spontaneous rearrangements, possibly as a consequence of an uncommon phenomenon in anuran cytogenetics: the presence of fragile sites or secondary constrictions not associated with NORs. We propose that this rare feature would have played an important role in the evolution of this group of frogs. From the evidence obtained in this and previous studies, we conclude that Lophyohylini presents a complex chromosome evolution."

But it has also been shown that diabetes can cause heart failure independently of ischemic heart disease (IHD) by causing diabetic cardiomyopathy. In contrast to diabetes and IHD, limited data exist regarding patients with diabetes and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Methods EVIdence based TreAtment in Heart Failure (EVITA-HF) comprises web-based case report data on demography, diagnostic measures, adverse events and 1-year follow-up of patients hospitalized for chronic heart failure and an ejection fraction ≤40%. In the present study we focused on the results of patients with diabetes and heart failure. Results Between February 2009 and November 2015, 4101 patients with chronic heart failure were included in 16 tertiary care centers in Germany. The mortality in patients with diabetes and DCM (n = 323) was more than double (15.2%) than that of DCM patients without diabetes (6.5%, p<0.001, n = 885). In contrast the mortality rate of patients with IHD was not influenced by the presence of diabetes (17.6% in patients with IHD and diabetes n = 945, vs. 14.7% in patients with IHD and no diabetes, n = 1236, p = 0.061). The results also remained stable after performing a multivariable analysis (unadjusted p-value for interaction = 0.002, adjusted p = 0.046). Conclusion The influence of diabetes on the mortality rate is only significant in patients with DCM not in patients with CAD. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms of this effect should be studied in greater detail to improve patient care and outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3035047288,"Monitoring the presence and spread of pathogens in the environment is of critical importance. Rapid detection of infectious disease outbreaks and prediction of their spread can facilitate early responses of health agencies and reduce the severity of outbreaks. Current sampling methods are sorely limited by available personnel and throughput. For instance, xenosurveillance utilizes captured arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes, as sampling tools to access blood from a wide variety of vertebrate hosts. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of nucleic acid from individual blooded mosquitoes can be used to identify mosquito and host species, and microorganisms including pathogens circulating within either host. However, there are practical challenges to collecting and processing mosquitoes for xenosurveillance, such as the rapid metabolization or decay of microorganisms within the mosquito midgut. This particularly affects pathogens that do not replicate in mosquitoes, preventing their detection by NGS or other methods. Accordingly, we performed a series of experiments to establish the windows of detection for DNA or RNA from human blood and/or viruses present in mosquito blood meals. Our results will contribute to the development of xenosurveillance techniques with respect to optimal timing of sample collection and NGS processing and will also aid trap design by demonstrating the stabilizing effect of temperature control on viral genome recovery from blood-fed mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W3035474775,"Environmentally available sodium tends to decrease with increasing elevation, and sodium resources in these sodium-poor environments are critical for the survival of herbivores. Eucalypt leaves in the subalpine Monaro region of NSW, Australia contain much less sodium than eucalypt leaves at lower elevations, and subalpine koalas obtain this much needed resource by eating the bark from some Eucalyptus mannifera trees. To better understand the availability of salty-barked trees, we searched for evidence of koala bark chewing at 100 randomly generated locations in the region. We found 318 E. mannifera trees with koala chew marks. We also analysed sodium concentrations in the bark of three unchewed E. mannifera trees from each site to determine whether there were trees with high bark sodium content that had not yet been utilized by koalas. Although 90% of unchewed trees had sodium concentrations less than 225.4 mg.kg-1 DM, some unchewed trees contained high sodium concentrations (up to 1213.1 mg.kg-1 DM). From the random survey, we can extrapolate that 11% of trees in this area have bark sodium above 300 mg.kg-1 DM, which is based on the concentration of bark sodium observed in at least moderately chewed trees. We would expect to find 0.24 of these trees per 200 m2, or 720,000 salty-barked trees in the 30 km by 20 km study area. Bark chewing by koalas is widespread in the area, and trees with salty bark are more common than initially thought. We discuss correlations with the occurrence of salty-barked trees and other landscape attributes; however, questions remain about why some E. mannifera trees have much more bark sodium than others. Studies such as this one should be expanded to identify sodium resources and their availability for other herbivorous species, since many are predicted to move to higher elevations in response to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3035082448,"Globally, the under-10 years of age mortality has not been comprehensively studied. We applied the life-course perspective in the analysis and interpretation of the event history demographic and verbal autopsy data to examine when and why children die before their 10th birthday.We analysed a decade (2005-2015) of event histories data on 22385 and 1815 verbal autopsies data collected by Iganga-Mayuge HDSS in eastern Uganda. We used the lifetable for mortality estimates and patterns, and Royston-Parmar survival analysis approach for mortality risk factors' assessment.The under-10 and 5-9 years of age mortality probabilities were 129 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 123-370) per 1000 live births and 11 (95% CI = 7-26) per 1000 children aged 5-9 years, respectively. The top four causes of new-born mortality and stillbirth were antepartum maternal complications (31%), intrapartum-related causes including birth injury, asphyxia and obstructed labour (25%), Low Birth Weight (LBW) and prematurity (20%), and other unidentified perinatal mortality causes (18%). Malaria, protein deficiency including anaemia, diarrhoea or gastrointestinal, and acute respiratory infections were the major causes of mortality among those aged 0-9 years-contributing 88%, 88% and 46% of all causes of mortality for the post-neonatal, child and 5-9 years of age respectively. 33% of all causes of mortality among those aged 5-9 years was a share of Injuries (22%) and gastrointestinal (11%). Regarding the deterministic pattern, nearly 30% of the new-borns and sick children died without access to formal care. Access to the treatment for the top five morbidities was after 4 days of symptoms' recognition. The childhood mortality risk factors were LBW, multiple births, having no partner, adolescence age, rural residence, low education level and belonging to a poor household, but their association was stronger among infants.We have identified the vulnerable groups at risk of mortality as LBW children, multiple births, rural dwellers, those whose mother are of low socio-economic position, adolescents and unmarried. The differences in causes of mortalities between children aged 0-5 and 5-9 years were noted. These findings suggest for a strong life-course approach in the design and implementation of child health interventions that target pregnant women and children of all ages."
https://openalex.org/W3035320936,"Purpose The establishment of candidate genes associated with susceptibility to TB is a challenge especially due to divergent frequencies among different populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) -173 G>C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and susceptibility to pulmonary TB in a population of southern Brazil. Methods Case-control study. Patients > 18 years old, diagnosed with pulmonary TB were included. The control group consisted of blood donors and household contacts, not relatives, healthy and > 18 years old. MIF -173 G>C SNPs were genotyped using real-time PCR using a TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. Results 174 patients and 166 controls were included. There were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls regarding genotype prevalence (p>0.05). Comparing patients with normal genotype (GG) with those with at least one C allele, there was also no statistically significant difference (p = 0.135). Also, there was no statistically significant difference comparing the homozygous for the mutation (CC) with the other patients (GG and CG) (p = 0.864). Conclusions We did not find association between MIF -173 G>C polymorphism and susceptibility to pulmonary TB."
https://openalex.org/W3035101293,"The affordability of pharmaceuticals has been a major challenge in US health care. Generic substitution has been proposed as an important tool to reduce the costs, yet little is known how the prices of more expensive brand-name drugs would be affected by an increased utilization of generics. We aimed to examine the trend of overall utilization and the total costs of brand-name oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), the most widely used form of contraception, and its association with the pharmaceutical market concentration among the OCPs. Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 2011-2014, a nationally representative survey of healthcare utilization, were extracted on the utilization of generic and brand-name OCPs. A multiple logit regression analysis was conducted to assess the trend in utilization of brand-name OCPs over time. Total costs, including the costs to the payers and consumers, were synthesized. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), an index describing market concentration, was constructed, and a multiple regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between the brand-name OCP prices and the market share of individual brand-name drugs. The odds of utilizing brand-name drugs decreased steadily in 2012, 2013, and 2014 compared to 2012 (AOR 0.87, 0.73, 0.55, respectively, p<0.05) controlling for patient mix. Despite significant decline in total utilization, there was a 90% increase in the price of brand-name OCPs, resulting an 18% increase in revenue from 2011 to 2014 for the industry. During this time, pharmaceutical market concentration for OCPs increased (HHI increased from 1105 in 2011 to 2415 in 2014). Each percentage point increase in the market share by a brand-name OCPs was associated with a $3.12 increase in its price. Market mechanisms matter. Practitioners and policy makers need to take market mechanisms into account in order to realize the benefits of generic substitutions."
https://openalex.org/W3035516450,"Pathological and clinical stage are associated with prostate cancer-specific survival after prostatectomy. With PSA screening, the post-surgery prognostic utility of clinical stage is debatable in studies seeking to identify new biomarkers. Few studies have investigated clinical stage and lethal prostate cancer association after accounting for pathological stage. We hypothesize that clinical stage provides prognostic information beyond pathological stage in the PSA era.Cox regression models tested associations between clinical and pathological stage and lethal prostate cancer among 3,064 participants from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and Physicians' Health Study (HPFS/PHS) who underwent prostatectomy. Likelihood ratio tests and c-statistics were used to assess the models' prognostic utility. Equivalent analyses were performed in 16,134 men who underwent prostatectomy at Johns Hopkins.Independently, clinical and pathological stage were associated (p<0.0001 for both) with rate of lethal prostate cancer in HPFS/PHS. The model with clinical and pathological stage fit significantly better than the model with only pathological stage in all men (p = 0.01) and in men diagnosed during the PSA era (p = 0.04). The mutually adjusted model also improved discriminatory ability. In the Johns Hopkins cohort, the model with clinical and pathological stage improved discriminatory ability and fit significantly better overall (p<0.0001) and in the PSA era (p<0.0001).Despite stage migration resulting from widespread PSA screening, clinical stage remains associated with progression to lethal prostate cancer independent of pathological stage. Future studies evaluating associations between new factors and poor outcome following prostatectomy should consider including both clinical and pathological stages since the data is already available."
