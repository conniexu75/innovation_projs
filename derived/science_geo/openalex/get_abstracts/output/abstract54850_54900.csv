https://openalex.org/W1991655565,"A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure, that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane systems are described, all of which abet consistent with, and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands. Note added in proof: Since this article was written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37 degrees C the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C. These and related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as iv other processes of cell differentiation."

The dose response curves for 1,25-DHCC and 25-HCC, the parent compound, are parallel, but 1,25-DHCC is about 100 times as potent on a weight basis. Brief exposure to maximum doses of either agent leads to prolonged bone resorption."
https://openalex.org/W1571527701,"Abstract Escherichia coli ribosomes were made deficient in a 50 S ribosomal protein component by treatment with ethanol and NH4Cl and their ability to carry out a number of partial reactions involved in polypeptide synthesis was examined. The ribosomes were found to be competent in all reactions in which the ribosome alone participated, but were markedly deficient in all reactions involving an interaction of the ribosome, GTP, and either of the supernatant factors T and G. Nonenzymatic phenylalanyl-tRNA and N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA binding and the peptidyl transferase activity were essentially intact in these ribosomes; enzymatic binding of phenylalanyl-tRNA and translocation occur, but at markedly reduced rates; uncoupled GTPase activity associated with G factor and the ability to bind [3H]GTP in the presence of G factor and fusidic acid were virtually abolished; and uncoupled GTPase activity associated with T factor was diminished to about 15% of the activity present with unextracted ribosomes. Polyphenylalanine synthesis and all the partial reactions were completely or substantially restored by readdition of the ribosomal extract."

https://openalex.org/W1973511325,"Insulin depresses both the activity of adenylate cyclase stimulated by glucagon, epinephrine, and sodium fluoride in liver cell membranes and the activity of adenylate cyclase stimulated by epinephrine and adrenocorticotropin in particulate preparations from homogenates of isolated fat cells. Significant inhibition is detected with very low concentrations (10(-11) molar) of insulin but not with unphysiologically high (10(-9)molar) concentrations of the hormone. These direct effects of insulin on an enzymatic system in broken-cell -preparations suggest a fundamental role of adenylate cyclase activity and of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the mechanism of action of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1485223239,"Factors regulating the citric acid cycle have been investigated in rat heart mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate plus malate or acetylcarnitine plus malate as substrates. Effects caused by changing the NAD oxidation-reduction state, the intramitochondrial ATP:ADP ratio, and the respiratory rate were studied in five different metabolic states produced by additions of ADP, oligomycin, or uncouplers. The accumulations of cycle intermediates and the mitochondrial content of CoA derivatives and pyridine nucleotides were measured in extracts prepared from the whole incubation medium or after rapid separation of the mitochondria from the medium. These data, together with measurements of substrate utilization, were used to calculate flux through the individual steps of the citric acid cycle. Pyruvate dehydrogenase was found not to be rate limiting for citric acid cycle activity. Flux through citrate synthase in State 3 was approximately the same (100 nmoles per min per mg) whether pyruvate or acetylcarnitine were used to generate acetyl-CoA, whereas acetyl-CoA levels were higher with pyruvate as substrate. Flux in State 4 with either substrate was diminished by 75 to 85% relative to State 3 and was associated during early incubation times with elevated levels of both NADH and acetyl-CoA, consonant with regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by product inhibition. A comparison of flux through citrate synthase and changes in the levels of intramitochondrial malate, citrate, ATP, and the NAD oxidation-reduction state showed that increased flux associated with a State 4 to 3 transition could be accounted for largely by an increased availability of oxalacetate to citrate synthase rather than by ATP inhibition. On the other hand, comparisons between states in which phosphate acceptor was not rate limiting for electron transport (State 3, uncoupled or uncoupled plus oligomycin) showed that oxalacetate availability remained high because of the highly oxidized state of the pyridine nucleotides, and indicated a regulation of citrate synthase under conditions of low acetyl-CoA availability by an energy-linked process dependent on substrate level phosphorylation. Thus, a 55% inhibition of flux through citrate synthase was obtained after addition of oligomycin to the uncoupled state with acetylcarnitine plus malate as substrate, but only a 25% inhibition was achieved with pyruvate plus malate as substrate. The intramitochondrial ATP:ADP ratio increased from 0.3 to 4:6 with either substrate under these conditions. A kinetic evaluation of the data indicated that the energy-dependent inhibition was not caused by a direct effect of ATP on citrate synthase, but was due to changes of the succinyl-CoA content relative to that of acetyl-CoA. This conclusion is based (a) on the finding of an accumulation of a short chain acyl-CoA compound identifiable as succinyl-CoA by direct enzyme assay under conditions of diminished citrate synthase flux, (b) a correlation between decreased flux and lowered acetyl-CoA levels in the different experiments, and (c) the observation that succinyl-CoA is an inhibitor of citrate synthase competitive with acetyl-CoA. A comparison of succinyl-CoA levels in mitochondria incubated in the different metabolic states indicated that its content was regulated by the phosphorylation state of the adenine nucleotides, presumably via the effect of altered GTP:GDP ratios on succinate thiokinase. Product inhibition of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase by succinyl-CoA was evidenced from an inverse relationship between α-ketoglutarate accumulation and succinyl-CoA levels. The conclusion is reached that feedback from the electron transport chain to the citric acid cycle is mediated by a combination of factors which include the phosphorylation state of the adenine and guanine nucleotides and the oxidation-reduction state of the pyridine nucleotides. Changes of these parameters secondarily affect the intramitochondrial concentrations of oxalacetate, acetyl-CoA, and succinyl-CoA, which are the direct regulators of citrate synthase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2016298537,"Mutant hemizygotes with X-linked hypophosphatemia lack a parathyroid hormone-sensitive component of inorganic phosphate transport in kidney; female heterozygotes retain a variable proportion of this type of transport. The residual mechanism for reabsorption in affected males allows inorganic phosphate efflux from the kidney to urine so that net ""secretion"" is sometimes observed; the latter is directly proportional to the serum concentration of inorganic phosphate. Calcium acts on the kidney tubule to enhance net reabsorption by this component of inorganic phosphate transport."

https://openalex.org/W1536460853,"The values of the kinetic constants for the reactions of legume root nodule hemoglobin (leghemoglobin) with oxygen and carbon monoxide have been determined by stopped flow spectrophotometry. Leghemoglobin a and leghemoglobin c, which differ in amino acid sequence and peptide chain length, have very similar kinetic constants. The oxygen combination rate constant is the largest measured for any hemoglobin. The oxygen dissociation rate constant is similar to that of mammalian myoglobins. The oxygen affinity calculated by combining the kinetic constants agrees with the equilibrium value determined directly. The rate constant for combination with carbon monoxide is large, and is reflected in the very great affinity of leghemoglobin for carbon monoxide. The kinetic constants for the reactions of leghemoglobin with oxygen are particularly well suited to favor the facilitation of oxygen diffusion by leghemoglobin in the environment of very low mean oxygen pressure existing within the cells of the root nodule. It is suggested that leghemoglobin-facilitated oxygen diffusion serves not only to augment the influx of oxygen, but serves as well to make the oxygen pressure within the nodule or cell everywhere nearly the same."
https://openalex.org/W1988371502,"Corticosterone production by isolated adrenal cells in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone is reduced when the cells are incubated in a medium that contains no calcium. This reduction is associated with an equal reduction of accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Production of corticosterone and accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate are increased when the calcium concentration in the medium is increased (from zero to 7.65 millimolar). This is in contrast to the situation in ""subcellular membrane fragments"" of adrenal tissue where high calcium in the medium (> 1.0 millimolar) inhibits cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation. We propose that adenyl cyclase in the intact plasma membrane is located in a compartment wherein calcium concentration is low and remains unaffected by the concentration of calcium in the extracellular space. It is proposed that, as the concentration of calcium in the incubation medium is increased from zero to 7.65 millimolar, the strength of the signal generated by the interaction of adrenocorticotropic hormone with its receptor and transmitted to the adenyl cyclase compartment is proportionately increased."
https://openalex.org/W2015527116,"Elevated concentrations of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate induce a variety of cell movements. The role of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in promoting those movements associated with growth prompted our study of in vitro microtubule-dependent axonal elongation. Ganglia treated with adenosine 5'-monophosphate show no enhancement over controls; treatment with adenosine 3', 5'monophosphate or its dibutyryl derivative significantly enhances elongation, as measured by increases in both axonal numbers and length. Our study suggests that adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate promotes elongation by stimulation of microtubule assembly."

https://openalex.org/W1514712862,"Abstract The effect of acetylcholine on the incorporation of 32Pi into phospholipids was studied in subfractions of guinea pig cerebral cortex obtained by sucrose density fractionation. Incorporation of label into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol was stimulated approximately 100 and 70%, respectively, by 10-4 m acetylcholine in a nerve ending fraction rich in acetylcholine esterase. The effect was not significant in other subcellular fractions investigated, including a denser nerve ending fraction. This action of acetylcholine was blocked by the addition of atropine but not by tubocurare. Labeling of phosphatidylinositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositol diphosphate was inhibited by about 20% in the presence of 10-4 m acetylcholine. This inhibition was not specific for any of the subfractions and was not affected by the addition of atropine."
https://openalex.org/W1513815820,"Abstract DNA polymerase II has been purified 27,000-fold in high yield by alumina grinding, polyethylene glycol-dextran phase partition, and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose and phosphocellulose columns from Escherichia coli pol A- (DNA polymerase I negative strain) endo I-. This enzyme activity resembles DNA polymerase I described by Kornberg. (a) It requires as template DNA either treated with exonuclease III or partially degraded with DNase I; (b) the activity is completely dependent on the presence of Mg2+ and all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates; (c) like DNA polymerase I, DNA polymerase II is inhibited by pyrophosphate and catalyzes both pyrophosphorolysis of DNA and a DNA-dependent pyrophosphate exchange into deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Unlike DNA polymerase I, DNA polymerase II activity is inhibited by high salt concentration or reagents which react with sulfhydryl groups. DNA polymerase II is not inhibited by antibodies directed against DNA polymerase I and the two polymerases are separated by phosphocellulose chromatography or by sedimentation in glycerol gradients. DNA polymerase II has an exonuclease activity which preferentially degrades single stranded DNA in the 3' to 5' direction. In contrast, DNA polymerase I has two exonuclease activities, one acting 3' to 5' on denatured DNA, the other acting 5' to 3', on native DNA. DNA polymerase II has a sedimentation rate in high or low ionic strength and a migration on gel filtration consistent with a molecular weight of approximately 120,000. Based upon the extent of purification there are fewer than 17 molecules of DNA polymerase II per bacterium. This amount of enzyme can account for the incorporation into DNA of 800 deoxynucleotide residues per min per cell under optimal assay conditions. The in vivo rate of DNA synthesis is approximately 3 x 105 nucleotides incorporated into DNA per min per bacterium. DNA polymerase II is found in pol A+ cells at approximately the same concentration observed in pol A- cells. The enzyme has been isolated from septation mutants of E. coli which produce DNA-negative cells (minicells). DNA polymerase II is present in minicells at approximately half the specific activity observed in the whole cells. A similar distribution of DNA polymerase I has been reported previously for DNA negative cells. These results and those concerning the mode of action of DNA polymerase II presented in the accompanying paper (Wickner, R. B., Ginsberg, B., and Hurwitz, J. (1972) J. Biol. Chem., 247, 498) suggest that this enzyme is probably not involved in the replication of DNA but may have a repair function."
https://openalex.org/W1498928656,"The metabolism of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide has been examined in a number of mouse tissues following intraperitoneal injection of 0.9 µmole of 14C-labeled nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. In all the tissues except liver, and to some extent intestine, nicotinamide was clearly a better precursor of DPN than was nicotinic acid. In the case of liver and intestine [14C]nicotinic acid produced a transient and considerable labeling of DPN. By 30 min after injection of nicotinic acid, label in the DPN pools of these two tissues had fallen to levels below that found after the administration of [14C]nicotinamide. The amounts of [14C]nicotinamide in the liver following [14C]nicotinic acid injection were far higher than the amounts found after injection of [14C] nicotinamide. Following the oral administration of nicotinic acid to mice, levels of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide in the blood changed in a fashion compatible with the liver and intestine serving as centers for the conversion of nicotinic acid to nicotinamide. Furthermore, it was shown that deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid was not a prerequisite for absorption of nicotinamide from the digestive tract. These observations are compatible with the hypothesis that metabolism in the mouse is designed for the utilization of nicotinamide as a precursor of DPN and that nicotinic acid is converted to nicotinamide for that purpose."

The inhibition appeared to be mediated, at least in part, via adrenergic inhibitory neurons located in the pelvic plexus. Atropine blocked the inhibitory response to injected cholinomimetic agents but did not alter the response to stimulation of the sympathetic nerves. Thus, the inhibitory neurons can be activated via both muscarinic and nonmuscarinic receptors, the latter being of primary physiological importance."
https://openalex.org/W1566291916,"Abstract Treatment of milk xanthine oxidase and chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase with high concentrations of salts for several hours resulted in the loss of reactivity toward O2 and NAD, respectively. Oxidation of xanthine by either enzyme in the presence of electron acceptors such as dichlorophenol indophenol was unimpaired under these conditions, in the presence of 3 m KI. Prolonged treatment of xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase with 3 m KI followed by extensive dialysis in 0.5 m KCl yielded flavin-free metalloproteins which had the absorption characteristics of their iron-sulfur chromophore. Both flavin-free enzymes showed markedly enhanced rates of electron transfer to cytochrome c and nitroblue tetrazolium compared to the native enzymes. The cytochrome c activity of flavin-free xanthine oxidase, in contrast to the same activity of native xanthine oxidase, was completely insensitive to superoxide dismutase. Prior reduction of the enzymes with their electron donor substrates resulted in a dramatic increase in the lability of FAD in the presence of 3 m KI. Thus, in the case of xanthine dehydrogenase reduced with NADH, the FAD was nearly completely dissociated in less than 5 min compared to the several hours required with the native enzyme. The flavin-free enzymes prepared by the modified procedure were much more stable, and showed superior ability to be reconstituted with FAD."
https://openalex.org/W1486178890,"Abstract Optimal transcription of the lac operon in a defined purified in vitro system is dependent upon the concentrations of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), the cyclic AMP-binding protein (CRP) and RNA polymerase. The concentration of CRP required for maximal lac transcription varies proportionately with the concentration of lac DNA used as template. Maximal lac transcription is obtained with less CRP when lac ps DNA is used as template than with wild type lac DNA. Both in vivo and in vitro the lac ps mutation appears to result in a more efficient lac promoter. The formation of a preinitiation complex which will synthesize lac mRNA upon addition of nucleoside triphosphates requires preincubation of λh80dlac DNA, RNA polymerase, CRP, and cyclic AMP. The formation of this preinitiation complex is both time and temperature dependent. A lag period of about 2 min is observed between the binding of RNA polymerase to lac DNA and the appearance of detectable lac specific hybridizable RNA. This lag period is possibly due to a slow transition occurring between the formation of the lac preinitiation complex and the onset of extensive polymerization. Our experiments provide further evidence that CRP and cyclic AMP act on lac DNA to stimulate an early step in the initiation of lac transcription by RNA polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W1593210585,"A membrane-bound oleyl coenzyme A desaturase from maturing Carthamus tinctorius seeds specifically catalyzed the conversion of oleyl-CoA to linoleyl-CoA. Any modification of the substrate, that is, a trans double bond, a shift in the position of the cis double bond, chain length, and the substitution of acyl carrier protein for CoA as the thioester moiety resulted in complete loss of activity. The system was strongly inhibited by a number of —SH reagents and metal chelators; carbon monoxide at various concentrations was ineffective; cyanide partially inhibited. Although DPNH and molecular oxygen were components of the system, DPNH could be replaced by photochemically reduced ferredoxin. This result would suggest that DPNH did not interact directly with molecular oxygen and the desaturase but served only as a source of electrons. Attempts at solubilization were unsuccessful."
https://openalex.org/W1492757887,"Abstract The major NADH-diaphorase in the human erythrocyte, diaphorase A, which is lacking in the erythrocyte of patients with congenital methemoglobinemia, was purified from normal red cells by adsorption to DEAE-cellulose, ammonium sulfate fractionation, column chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and Sephadex G-75, and starch block electrophoresis. The final preparation was purified 129,000-fold over hemolysate and the enzyme was homogeneous judging from disc electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and gel filtration. Absorption spectra of the purified enzyme are characteristic of flavoproteins showing absorption maxima at 225 nm, 273 nm, 393 nm and 462 nm and shoulders of absorption at 430 and 488 nm. The ratio of absorbance at 273 to 462 nm is 6.1 for the enzyme. The prosthetic group is shown to be FAD by paper chromatography of an enzyme extract. The enzyme has no heme group judging from its absorbance at 410 nm. The minimal molecular weight calculated from the flavin content is 34,400 and the molecular weight determined by gel filtration is 33,000. In view of these results, the enzyme has 1 mole of FAD as the prosthetic group per mole of apoenzyme. The isoelectric point of the enzyme is at pH 6.4. The enzyme easily increases its net negative charges resulting in two additional bands with activities on electrophoresis. The high reduction rate of methemoglobin attained in the red cells cannot be attained in vitro by the purified enzyme, and the possible existence of an electron carrier protein in the red cells is discussed."

Reconstitution of a complex of succinoxidase from individual partially purified components of the respiratory chain required the time-dependent interaction between all components except succinate dehydrogenase. Succinate dehydrogenase added after formation of the complex interacted rapidly and within seconds succinoxidase activity appeared. 2. An active succinoxidase was formed when cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase were added after formation of the complex, but the assembly of these components did not correspond to the physiological patterns. Only when these components were present from the beginning, was the oxidation of succinate by the complex resistant to an antiserum against cytochrome c, a response characteristic for phosphorylating submitochondrial particles. 3. A new soluble protein factor was found to be required for the operation of the succinoxidase complex. The factor was retained on a Sephadex G-100 column and was separated from cytochrome c1. It appears to participate in electron transfer between cytochromes b and c1. 4.

https://openalex.org/W1577298126,"Abstract At concentrations of 10-4 to 10-5 m, cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) stimulated the incorporation of radioactive uridine into RNA in horse lymphocytes but did not stimulate the incorporation of radioactive thymidine into DNA. In either the absence or in the presence of a saturating concentration of phytohemagglutinin, cyclic 3',5'-AMP increased the rate of RNA synthesis by 40 to 50%. In contrast, N6, O2'-dibutyryl 3',5'-cyclic AMP inhibited RNA synthesis whereas N6-monobutyryl cyclic 3',5'-AMP had a slight stimulatory effect. At 10-4 m, cyclic 3',5'-AMP does not affect the rate of uridine uptake in to the trichloroacetic acid-soluble pool, the synthesis of uridine triphosphate, or the rate of RNA degradation. It is concluded that cyclic 3',5'-AMP exerts a direct effect upon transcription and that phytohemagglutinin does not induce lymphocyte transformation by a simple effect upon the endogenous level of cyclic 3',5'-AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1507838375,"Abstract In agreement with an earlier report (Conrad, R. H., Heitz, J. R., and Brand, L., Biochemistry, 9, 1540 (1970)), auramine O was found to bind to horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase at two equivalent noninteracting sites per enzyme molecule, with an intrinsic dissociation constant Kr = 1.65 x 10-5 m in 0.05 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 at 25°. The dye was displaced competitively from the enzyme by substrates (ethanol and 1-butanol), substrate inhibitors (decanoic acid, imidazole, and pyrazole), and by inhibitors binding to the zinc ion presumed to be at the active site (1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2-bipyridine). The dye forms ternary complexes, with comparable affinity, with the binary complexes of the enzyme with NAD+, NADH, and adenosine diphosphoribose. In all three cases, the dissociation constant of auramine O from the ternary complex is significantly lower than the dissociation constant for the enzyme-auramine O binary complex. On the basis of the noncompetitive inhibition of liver alcohol dehydrogenase by auramine O in initial rate studies, Conrad et al. suggested that the dye binding site is distinct from the coenzyme and substrate binding sites. This interpretation is incompatible with the data summarized above. The apparent noncompetitive inhibition kinetic data are shown here to be the consequence of the unique ability of the dye to form ternary complexes with the enzyme-NAD+ and enzyme-NADH binary complexes. Thus, the auramine O-alcohol dehydrogenase interaction offers an additional case to the general correlation that most dyes which bind tightly to enzymes interact at regions overlapping binding sites for the normal ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1651195153,"Abstract Detritiation of [2-3H]glycerol-3-P by isolated liver mitochondria can be used to assay the activity of mitochondrial glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase. The method differs from measurements of dihydroxyacetone-3-P formation only by the isotope effect on the reaction rate. Under assay conditions liver mitochondria of hyperthyroid rats detritiated [2-3H]glycerol-3-P 16 times faster than those of normal controls. However, the value of K0.5s (the concentration of glycerol-3-P giving 0.5 Vmax) for the oxidation of glycerol-3-P by mitochondria of hyperthyroid rats was 5 times higher than for the reaction catalyzed by mitochondria of normal animals. From the data given by studies with isolated mitochondria, the expected rates of detritiation of [2-3H[glycerol-3-P by the intact liver could be estimated. Experiments then carried out on perfused livers of hypothyroid, normal, and hyperthyroid rats revealed that the rates of the reaction occurring in the intact organ exceeded by far the assayed capabilities of the mitochondrial glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase system. These results indicated that the rate of detritiation of [2-3H]-glycerol-3-P by the liver is not determined by the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme. Although livers of hyperthyroid rats were found to detritiate [2-3H]glycerol-3-P twice as rapidly as those of normal controls, the activity of mitochondrial glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase was far too low to account for the increase. These findings led to a test of the role of the NADH dehydrogenase system in the reaction. Infusion of rotenone into the liver of a normal rat resulted in a marked decrease in the rate of detritiation of [2-3H]glycerol-3-P, the rotenone-insensitive pathway accounting for only 20% of the over-all rate. The results described in this communication do not support the concept of a glycerol-3-P cycle in liver regulated by thyroid hormones but indicate that the pathway of oxidation of extramitochondrial hydrogen leads through respiratory chain-linked NADH dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1552301469,"Abstract The properties of the substrate binding site of the bull semen nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nucleosidase were studied with a titrimetric assay. The adenosine derivatives, adenosine, AMP, ADP, and ADP-ribose, were found to inhibit the NADase-catalyzed hydrolysis of NAD. Inhibition by these compounds was observed to be competitive with respect to NAD. The importance of an adenosine region and a pyrophosphate region at the substrate binding site of this enzyme was demonstrated by the relative Ki values obtained for these compounds. N1-Alkylnicotinamide chlorides were also shown to be substrate-competitive inhibitors of the NADase-catalyzed hydrolysis of NAD. These compounds were suggested to be bound at a pyridinium ring region of the substrate binding site. The positive chain length effect observed in the binding of N1-alkylnicotinamide chlorides, N1-ethyl- to N1-dodecylnicotinamide chloride, inclusive, to the enzyme suggested the presence of a hydrophobic region close by the pyridinium ring region. Multiple inhibition studies demonstrating simultaneous binding of adenosine derivatives and N1-methylnicotinamide chloride indicate that the binding of these inhibitors occurs at different parts of the substrate binding site."

This degranulation, accompanied by the release of lysosomal enzymes and vasoactive materials, may be an important part of the mechanism resulting in vascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W1547221692,"Abstract The metabolism in mouse and chick embryo fibroblast cultures of the purine nucleoside analogue 7-deazanebularin has been studied. The analogue is cytotoxic at low concentrations, it is rapidly phosphorylated and enters the cellular nucleotide pools, and it is incorporated into cellular DNA and RNA. A substantial proportion of the incorporated material is present at the 3' termini of tRNA molecules. 7-Deazanebularin is also incorporated into the RNA of Mengovirus and the DNA of vaccinia virus, and it strongly inhibits cellular and viral nucleic acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1596342145,"Carbonic anhydrase has been spin labeled at the active center with a nitroxide-substituted sulfonamide and a nitroxide derivative of bromosuccinic acid which reacts with a histidyl residue near the zinc ion in human carbonic anhydrase B. The spin label on the sulfonamide is highly immobilized in all species and isozyme variants of carbonic anhydrase. The spin-labeled sulfonamide attached to bovine carbonic anhydrase shows no rotation relative to the protein molecule, whereas complexes with other species variants show slight rotation of the sulfonamide relative to the protein. ESR spectra of the spin-labeled sulfonamide bound to Co(II) and Zn(II) derivatives of the enzyme are almost identical, suggesting similar conformations at the active centers of the two active metallocarbonic anhydrases. Only one binding site for the spin-labeled sulfonamide is present on carbonic anhydrase and carboxymethylation of a histidyl residue near the zinc ion of human carbonic anhydrase B does not prevent sulfonamide binding, but increases the dissociation constant by an order of magnitude. In contrast to the spin label on the sulfonamide, the spin label attached to the succinyl histidyl residue in the active center undergoes considerable rotation relative to the protein molecule. Sulfonamide binding is prevented by the presence of the covalently linked nitroxide-succinyl group. Specific denaturation of the active center by urea and guanidine hydrochloride has been followed by the release of free label from the spin-labeled sulfonamide complex with carbonic anhydrase and is compared with general denaturation of the molecule as followed by difference spectra and circular dichroism. Active center denaturation proceeds more rapidly than denaturation of the whole molecule, but appears to be part of the same process. The spin-labeled sulfonamide protects against denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride, but not against denaturation by urea."
https://openalex.org/W2161019938,"Abstract Specific incorporation of [7-14C]nicotinamide into the malate-lactate transhydrogenase and the subsequent purification of the radioactive enzyme are reported. An amino acid composition of the purified enzyme is presented. The transhydrogenase does not appear to contain zinc since 65Zn cannot be incorporated into the protein. Furthermore, the enzyme activity is not inhibited by chelating agents. The native enzyme appears to have pyruvate bound tightly to the protein as measured by the incorporation of tritium from borotridide reduction and the subsequent isolation of [3H]lactate after protein hydrolysis. The role of this pyruvate in the mechanism is not known since reduction by borohydride causes only a 20% drop in enzymatic activity. Treatment of the transhydrogenase with NADase destroys enzymatic activity and releases nicotinic acid and nicotinamide from the enzyme. Treatment of the enzyme with 7 m urea, as well as 6 m guanidine-HCl and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate causes a slow release of the whole prosthetic group, which has been isolated and identified as NAD-NADH. The apoenzyme which has been separated from the prosthetic group by gel filtration is virtually insoluble. Succinylation and 7 m urea can both be used to solubilize this protein which has been shown to have a molecular weight of approximately 30,000 x 106 by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The holoenzyme has a molecular weight of 100,000 to 115,000 x 106, and thus the enzyme appears to be composed of either three or four subunits. The kinetics of the transhydrogenation reaction yields results consistent with a type of ping-pong mechanism. The half-reactions have also been shown to proceed stoichiometrically. The over-all mechanism is more complex, however, as each product is a competitive inhibitor for the reaction and abortive complexes are formed. A mechanism based on the kinetic evidence and in agreement with that proposed by Dolin ((1969) J. Biol. Chem., 244, 5273) is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1485356633,"Abstract The optimum concentration of MgCl2 for the activity of yeast lysyl-tRNA synthetase (l-lysine:tRNA ligase (AMP), EC 6.1.1.6) in the presence of 1 mm ATP was lower for the ATP-PPi exchange reaction (5 mm) than for the aminoacylation reaction (15 mm) using 1 to 2 mg per ml of tRNA. The presence of 0.1 m KCl was without effect on the ATP-PPi exchange reaction but gave considerable stimulation of the rate of the aminoacylation reaction at 1 to 10 mm MgCl2. The stimulation was not reduced by addition of pyrophosphatase to the assay system. Of the salts tested for stimulation of the esterification reaction, KCl and NH4Cl were the most effective, while NaCl and Tris-HCl gave similar, but lower effects. At 2.5 mm MgCl2 there were marked increases in the observed rate of the aminoacylation reaction after incubation of tRNA but not enzyme, in presence of 0.1 m KCl or 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl. The results obtained are interpreted in terms of a requirement for the presence of salt to maintain tRNAlys in active conformation for the esterification reaction catalyzed by lysyl-tRNA synthetase."
