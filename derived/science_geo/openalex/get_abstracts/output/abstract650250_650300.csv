https://openalex.org/W3014656992,"Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike The surface of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is decorated with trimeric spikes that bind to host cell receptors. These spikes also elicit an antibody response, so understanding antibody recognition may aid in vaccine design. Yuan et al. determined the structure of CR3022, a neutralizing antibody obtained from a convalescent SARS-CoV–infected patient, in complex with the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. The antibody binds to an epitope conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that is distinct from the receptor-binding site. CR3022 likely binds more tightly to SARS-CoV because its epitope contains a glycan not present in SARS-CoV-2. Structural modeling showed that the epitope is only revealed when at least two of the three spike proteins are in a conformation competent to bind the receptor. Science , this issue p. 630"

https://openalex.org/W3014326690,"Summary The etiology of aortic aneurysms is poorly understood, but it is associated with atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and abnormal transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling in smooth muscle. Here, we investigated the interactions between these different factors in aortic aneurysm development and identified a key role for smooth muscle cell (SMC) reprogramming into a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like state. SMC-specific ablation of TGF-β signaling in Apoe−/− mice on a hypercholesterolemic diet led to development of aortic aneurysms exhibiting all the features of human disease, which was associated with transdifferentiation of a subset of contractile SMCs into an MSC-like intermediate state that generated osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and macrophages. This combination of medial SMC loss with marked increases in non-SMC aortic cell mass induced exuberant growth and dilation of the aorta, calcification and ossification of the aortic wall, and inflammation, resulting in aneurysm development."

https://openalex.org/W3014293329,"At present, our ability to comprehend the dynamics of food systems and the consequences of their rapid ‘transformations’ is limited. In this paper, we propose to address this gap by exploring the interactions between the sustainability of food systems and a set of key drivers at the global scale. For this we compile a metric of 12 key drivers of food system from a globally-representative set of low, middle, and high-income countries and analyze the relationships between these drivers and a composite index that integrates the four key dimensions of food system sustainability, namely: food security & nutrition, environment, social, and economic dimensions. The two metrics highlight the important data gap that characterizes national systems’ statistics—in particular in relation to transformation, transport, retail and distribution. Spearman correlations and Principal Component Analysis are then used to explore associations between levels of sustainability and drivers. With the exception of one economic driver (trade flows in merchandise and services), the majority of the statistically significant correlations found between food system sustainability and drivers appear to be negative. The fact that most of these negative drivers are closely related to the global demographic transition that is currently affecting the world population highlights the magnitude of the challenges ahead. This analysis is the first one that provides quantitative evidence at the global scale about correlations between the four dimensions of sustainability of our food systems and specific drivers."
https://openalex.org/W3015051572,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is more prevalent in males; however, the etiology for this sex bias is not well understood. Many mutations on X-linked cell adhesion molecule NLGN4X result in ASD or intellectual disability. NLGN4X is part of an X-Y pair, with NLGN4Y sharing ∼97% sequence homology. Using biochemistry, electrophysiology, and imaging, we show that NLGN4Y displays severe deficits in maturation, surface expression, and synaptogenesis regulated by one amino acid difference with NLGN4X. Furthermore, we identify a cluster of ASD-associated mutations surrounding the critical amino acid in NLGN4X, and these mutations phenocopy NLGN4Y. We show that NLGN4Y cannot compensate for the functional deficits observed in ASD-associated NLGN4X mutations. Altogether, our data reveal a potential pathogenic mechanism for male bias in NLGN4X-associated ASD."
https://openalex.org/W3014647156,"Cellular metabolism plays important functions in dictating stem cell behaviors, although its role in stomach epithelial homeostasis has not been evaluated in depth. Here, we show that the energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK) governs gastric epithelial progenitor differentiation. Administering the AMPK activator metformin decreases epithelial progenitor proliferation and increases acid-secreting parietal cells (PCs) in mice and organoids. AMPK activation targets Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), known to govern progenitor proliferation and PC fate choice, and PGC1α, which we show controls PC maturation after their specification. PC-specific deletion of AMPKα or PGC1α causes defective PC maturation, which could not be rescued by metformin. However, metformin treatment still increases KLF4 levels and suppresses progenitor proliferation. Thus, AMPK activates KLF4 in progenitors to reduce self-renewal and promote PC fate, whereas AMPK-PGC1α activation within the PC lineage promotes maturation, providing a potential suggestion for why metformin increases acid secretion and reduces gastric cancer risk in humans."

https://openalex.org/W3014758182,"Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) has been identified previously in the pathogenesis of hypertension and some gestational diseases. However, the biological functions of MALAT1 in pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) are still poorly understood. Herein, we aim to explore the functional relevance of MALAT1 in PIH and to explain the potential underlying mechanisms. We found that the levels of ET-1 and MALAT1 were upregulated and that of miR-150-5p were downregulated in the serum of pregnant women with PIH and the aortic endothelial cells (ECs) of reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP)-induced rat models. In aortic ECs, MALAT1 could competitively bind to miR-150-5p to upregulate the expression of ET-1. The MALAT1/miR-150-5p/ET-1 axis regulated the expression of endothelin B receptor (ETBR) in aortic ECs leading to oxidative stress imbalance and increased the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-18 and IL-1β), which concurrently activated the NF-κB pathway to regulate the ETBR expression and to stimulate smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction. Furthermore, silencing MALAT1 could alleviate the hypertensive symptoms of RUPP-induced rat models. Taken conjointly, the upregulation of MALAT1 can reduce the expression of ET-1 by competitively binding to miR-150-5p, which enhances the expression of ETBR via the activation of the NF-κB pathway in SMCs, thus exacerbating the hypertensive symptoms in the RUPP-induced rat models."
https://openalex.org/W3014985813,"Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is a dynamin protein that mediates mitochondrial fusion at the inner membrane. OPA1 is also necessary for maintaining the cristae and thus essential for supporting cellular energetics. OPA1 exists as membrane-anchored long form (L-OPA1) and short form (S-OPA1) that lacks the transmembrane region and is generated by cleavage of L-OPA1. Mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular stresses activate the inner membrane–associated zinc metallopeptidase OMA1 that cleaves L-OPA1, causing S-OPA1 accumulation. The prevailing notion has been that L-OPA1 is the functional form, whereas S-OPA1 is an inactive cleavage product in mammals, and that stress-induced OPA1 cleavage causes mitochondrial fragmentation and sensitizes cells to death. However, S-OPA1 contains all functional domains of dynamin proteins, suggesting that it has a physiological role. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that S-OPA1 can maintain cristae and energetics through its GTPase activity, despite lacking fusion activity. Here, applying oxidant insult that induces OPA1 cleavage, we show that cells unable to generate S-OPA1 are more sensitive to this stress under obligatory respiratory conditions, leading to necrotic death. These findings indicate that L-OPA1 and S-OPA1 differ in maintaining mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, we found that cells that exclusively express L-OPA1 generate more superoxide and are more sensitive to Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeability transition, suggesting that S-OPA1, and not L-OPA1, protects against cellular stress. Importantly, silencing of OMA1 expression increased oxidant-induced cell death, indicating that stress-induced OPA1 cleavage supports cell survival. Our findings suggest that S-OPA1 generation by OPA1 cleavage is a survival mechanism in stressed cells.

https://openalex.org/W3015023975,"The burden of food insecurity is large in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet the evidence-base on the relation between household food insecurity and early child development is extremely limited. Furthermore, available research mostly relies on cross-sectional data, limiting the quality of existing evidence. We use longitudinal data on preschool-aged children and their households in Ghana to investigate how being in a food insecure household was associated with early child development outcomes across three years. Household food insecurity was measured over three years using the Household Hunger Score. Households were first classified as “ever food insecure” if they were food insecure at any round. We also assessed persistence of household food insecurity by classifying households into three categories: (i) never food insecure; (ii) transitory food insecurity, if the household was food insecure only in one wave; and (iii) persistent food insecurity, if the household was food insecure in two or all waves. Child development was assessed across literacy, numeracy, social-emotional, short-term memory, and self-regulation domains. Controlling for baseline values of each respective outcome and child and household characteristics, children from ever food insecure households had lower literacy, numeracy and short-term memory. When we distinguished between transitory and persistent food insecurity, transitory spells of food insecurity predicted decreased numeracy (β = -0.176, 95% CI: -0.317; -0.035), short-term memory (β = -0.237, 95% CI: -0.382; -0.092), and self-regulation (β = -0.154, 95% CI: -0.326; 0.017) compared with children from never food insecure households. By contrast, children residing in persistently food insecure households had lower literacy scores (β = -0.243, 95% CI: -0.496; 0.009). No gender differences were detected. Results were broadly robust to the inclusion of additional controls. This novel evidence from a Sub-Saharan African country highlights the need for multi-sectoral approaches including social protection and nutrition to support early child development."
https://openalex.org/W3014870525,"The use of compost in urban agriculture offers an opportunity to increase nutrient recycling in urban ecosystems, but recent studies have shown that compost application often results in phosphorus (P) being applied far in excess of crop nutrient demand, creating the potential for P loss through leachate and runoff. Management goals such as maximizing crop yields or maximizing the mass of nutrients recycled from compost may inadvertently result in P loss, creating a potential ecosystem disservice. Here, we report the results from the first two years of an experimental study in which four different crops grown in raised-bed garden plots with high background P and organic matter received one of two types of compost (municipal compost made from urban organics waste, or manure-based compost) at two different levels (applied based on crop N or P demand), while additional treatments received synthetic N and P fertilizer or no soil amendments. Because of the low N:P ratio of compost relative to crop nutrient uptake, compost application based on crop N demand resulted in overapplication of P. Crop yield did not differ among treatments receiving compost inputs, and the mass of P recovered in crops relative to P inputs decreased for treatments with higher compost application rates. Treatments receiving compost targeted to crop N demand had P leachate rates approximately twice as high as other treatments. These results highlight tradeoffs inherent in recycling nutrients through UA, but they also show that targeted compost application rates have the capacity to maintain crop yields while minimizing nutrient loss. UA has the potential to help close the urban nutrient loop, but if UA is to be scaled up in order to maximize potential social, economic, and environmental benefits, it is especially important to carefully manage nutrients to avoid ecosystem disservices from nutrient pollution."
https://openalex.org/W3014952872,"There is a need for development of sustainable production processes for production of fats/oils and lipid derived chemicals. The dimorphic oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is a promising organism for conversion of biomass hydrolysate to lipids, but in many such processes hyphae formation will be problematic. We have therefore constructed and compared the performance of strains carrying deletions in several published gene targets suggested to abolish hyphae formation (MHY1, HOY1 and CLA4). The MHY1-deletion was the only of the tested strains which did not exhibit hyphae formation under any of the conditions tested. The MHY1-deletion also had a weak positive effect on lipid accumulation without affecting the total fatty acid composition, irrespective of the nitrogen source used. MHY1 has been suggested to constitute a functional homolog of the stress responsive transcription factors MSN2/4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the deletion of which are highly stress sensitive. However, the deletion of MHY1 displayed only minor difference on survival of a range of acute or long term stress and starvation conditions. We conclude that the deletion of MHY1 in Y.lipolytica is a reliable way of abolishing hyphae formation with few detectable negative side effects regarding growth, stress tolerance and lipid accumulation and composition."
https://openalex.org/W3014821714,"Microbial community profiles have been associated with a variety of traits, including methane emissions in livestock. These profiles can be difficult and expensive to obtain for thousands of samples (e.g. for accurate association of microbial profiles with traits), therefore the objective of this work was to develop a low-cost, high-throughput approach to capture the diversity of the rumen microbiome. Restriction enzyme reduced representation sequencing (RE-RRS) using ApeKI or PstI, and two bioinformatic pipelines (reference-based and reference-free) were compared to bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing using repeated samples collected two weeks apart from 118 sheep that were phenotypically extreme (60 high and 58 low) for methane emitted per kg dry matter intake (n = 236). DNA was extracted from freeze-dried rumen samples using a phenol chloroform and bead-beating protocol prior to RE-RRS. The resulting sequences were used to investigate the repeatability of the rumen microbial community profiles, the effect of laboratory and analytical method, and the relationship with methane production. The results suggested that the best method was PstI RE-RRS analyzed with the reference-free approach, which accounted for 53.3±5.9% of reads, and had repeatabilities of 0.49±0.07 and 0.50±0.07 for the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2), phenotypic correlations with methane yield of 0.43±0.06 and 0.46±0.06 for PC1 and PC2, and explained 41±8% of the variation in methane yield. These results were significantly better than for bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the same samples (p<0.05) except for the correlation between PC2 and methane yield. A Sensitivity study suggested approximately 2000 samples could be sequenced in a single lane on an Illumina HiSeq 2500, meaning the current work using 118 samples/lane and future proposed 384 samples/lane are well within that threshold. With minor adaptations, our approach could be used to obtain microbial profiles from other metagenomic samples."
https://openalex.org/W3014489650,"Silicon (Si) supplementation is well-known for enhancing plant resistance to insect pests, however, only recently studies revealed that Si accumulation in the plant not only confers a mechanical barrier to insect feeding, but also primes jasmonic acid-dependent defenses. Here, we examined whether Si supplementation alters wheat volatile emissions that influence the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) olfactory preference and the aphid parasitoid Lysiphlebus testaceipes. Even though Si accumulation in wheat did not impact aphid performance, we found that R. padi preferred constitutive volatiles from–Si wheat over those emitted by +Si wheat plants. In Y-tube olfactometer bioassays, the parasitoid was attracted to volatiles from +Si uninfested wheat, but not to those from–Si uninfested wheat. +Si and–Si aphid-infested plants released equally attractive blends to the aphid parasitoid; however, wasps were unable to distinguish +Si uninfested plant odors from those of aphid-infested treatments. GC-MS analyses revealed that +Si uninfested wheat plants emitted increased amounts of a single compound, geranyl acetone, compared to -Si uninfested wheat, but similar to those emitted by aphid-infested treatments. By contrast, Si supplementation in wheat did not alter composition of aphid-induced plant volatiles. Our results show that changes in wheat volatile blend induced by Si accumulation mediate the non-preference behavior of the bird cherry-oat aphid and the attraction of its parasitoid L. testaceipes. Conversely to the literature, Si supplementation by itself seems to work as an elicitor of induced defenses in wheat, and not as a priming agent."
https://openalex.org/W3014109662,"Background Although frailty is a frequent occurrence in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, evidence on the frequency of frailty transition is scarce. Aims The present study aimed to describe the frailty status transition rates over a 2-year period and their associated clinical outcomes in stable COPD patients, and to determine predictors of improvement in frailty status. Methods We prospectively included 119 patients with stable COPD (mean age ± SD, 66.9 ± 7.9 years) over a follow-up period of 2 years. Frailty was assessed using the Fried criteria (unintentional weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, low activity level, and slow walking speed). Several demographic, clinical, and health-related variables were measured. We calculated the rates for each of the frailty transitions (no change, improvement, or worsening) between baseline and 2 years. Outcomes were compared using one-way analysis of variance and predictors of improvement were identified in multivariate logistic regression. Results After 2 years of follow-up, 21 (17.6%) patients had an improved frailty status, 14 (11.7%) had worsened, and 84 (70.5%) had maintained the same frailty status. The worsening group (vs no change group) had greater dyspnea (p = 0.013) and disability (p = 0.036) and lower handgrip strength (p = 0.001). In contrast, the improved group (vs no change group) had greater handgrip (p<0.001) and quadriceps strength (p = 0.032). Furthermore, the improved group had greater handgrip strength (p<0.001), quadriceps strength (p = 0.003), physical activity (p = 0.008), and lower disability (p = 0.019) than the worsening group. Additionally, we determined that the 5STS test (≤ 13.6s) and exacerbations (≥ 2) were independent predictors for improvement in frailty status [adjusted OR 9.46, p = 0.058 and adjusted OR 0.12, p = 0.026, respectively]. Conclusions Frailty is a dynamic process for approximately one-third of patients with stable COPD and transitions in frailty status are associated with significant changes in clinical outcomes. The 5STS and exacerbations were independent predictors of improvement in frailty status."
https://openalex.org/W3014291733,"Interpreting human behavioral patterns during the Middle Paleolithic in the Levant is crucial for better understanding the dispersals and evolution of Homo sapiens and their possible interactions with other hominin groups. Here, we reconstruct the technological behavior, focusing on the centripetal Levallois method at Nesher Ramla karst sinkhole, Israel. Nesher Ramla karst sinkhole is dated to the Marine Isotope stages (MIS) 6 and 5 and represents one of the oldest occurrences of the centripetal Levallois reduction strategy in the Near East. The Levallois centripetal technology is often seen as a marker of human dispersals and adaptations in the Middle Paleolithic/Middle Stone Age of Africa and the Near East. This technology is documented in East African sites as early as 300 kya and in the Levant as early as 130 kya. However, the degree of similarity between African and Levantine centripetal technology and whether it originates from the same source remain under debate. In this paper, we focus on describing the lithic organization at Unit III of Nesher Ramla (dated to MIS 5), which is dominated by the centripetal Levallois method in association with other reduction sequences. Both preferential and recurrent centripetal Levallois modes were used at the site to produce oval and rectangular flakes. Other minor reduction sequences include unidirectional convergent method for Levallois points production and a specific method for the manufacture of naturally backed knives. The lithic data from Unit III of Nesher Ramla is further used in inter-site comparisons suggesting that the mid-Middle Paleolithic sites in the Near East possess common technological characteristics, especially the use of the centripetal Levallois method as predominant reduction strategy. This trend differs from what is usually observed in Africa and Europe, where the centripetal Levallois method is modestly represented during MIS 5 and is accompanied by other, more dominant, reduction strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3014260995,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is a key regulator of hepatic immune responses. Recently, we reported that PRMT1 regulates the tumor immune response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we found that PRMT1 expression in human HCC correlates with that of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), PD-L2, and other checkpoint genes. PRMT1 deletion in mice reduced PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in tumors and reduced the efficiency of PD-1 antibody treatment in a diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC mouse model, suggesting that PRMT1 regulates the hepatic immune checkpoint. Mice had reduced PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression when PRMT1 was specifically deleted in tumor cells or macrophages, but PRMT1 deletion in dendritic cells did not alter PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression. rs975484 is a common polymorphism in the human PRMT1 gene promoter, and we found that it alters PRMT1 expression in blood monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages in human HCC. PRMT1 expression was higher in individuals with a GG genotype than in individuals with a CC genotype, and heterozygous carriers had intermediate expression. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that this differential expression is due to an extra C/EBPβ-binding site in the PRMT1 promoter of individuals carrying the minor G allele. The rs975484 genotype also correlated with PRMT1 target expression in HCC. Individuals with the GG genotype had significantly higher levels of the PRMT1 targets PD-L1, PD-L2, and VISTA than those with the CC genotype. We conclude that PRMT1 critically controls immune checkpoints in mice and humans and that the PRMT1 polymorphism rs975484 affects checkpoint gene expression in HCC.

However, the overall response rate of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients is unsatisfactory, which limits application in clinical practice. Therefore, biomarkers that could effectively predict the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are crucial for patient selection. Biomarkers reflecting tumor immune microenvironment and tumor cell intrinsic features, such as PD-L1 expression, density of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor mutational burden, and mismatch repair deficiency, have been shown to be associated with treatment effect of anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy in several tumor types. Furthermore, gut microbiota, circulating biomarkers, and a patient's previous history have been found to be valuable predictors as well (reviewed in Ref. 17Yi M. Jiao D. Xu H. Liu Q. Zhao W. Han X.

In this work, we show that PRMT1 is an important regulator of immune checkpoint pathways in HCC. PRMT1 regulates PD-L1 and PD-L2 gene expression in mice and humans. The PRMT1 gene polymorphism rs975484 correlates with PRMT1 expression in immune cells and PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in human HCC. Our findings suggest that rs975484 can be useful for predicting checkpoint gene expression in patients with HCC. In humans, PRMT1 gene expression varies considerably between individuals. We hypothesized that genetic variations can account for some of these expression differences. Common genetic polymorphisms associated with the PRMT1 gene are presented in Fig. 1A; SNPs associated with phenotype in GWAS studies are highlighted in red. We analyzed SNP genotype and PRMT1 mRNA expression in human monocytes from individuals who presented to the University of Kansas Liver Treatment Center during the period from November 2014 to June 2015 (Table S1). We found that the rs975484, rs1045567, rs10411771, and rs3816047 genotypes correlate with PRMT1 mRNA expression in human blood monocytes (Fig. 1B) and that rs975484 correlates with PRMT1 expression in human blood monocyte–derived macrophages (Fig. 1C). The genotype–mRNA correlation was independent of the severity of liver disease (Fig. S1). It is important to note the linkage disequilibrium between rs975484, rs1045567, rs10411771, and rs8109314 (Fig. 1A). For example, the linkage disequilibrium between rs975484 and rs1045567 is 0.97; thus, the majority (in our case, 137 of 141) of individuals that have GG, GC, or CC for rs975484 also have CC, CT, or TT, respectively, for rs1045567. Because rs975484 showed the strongest correlation with PRMT1 expression and is located in the promoter region, where it is more likely to affect transcription factor binding (Fig. 1A), we focused further studies on rs975484. First we confirmed that C-to-G substitution in the position of rs975484 can affect PRMT1 expression. We created PRMT1 promoter–driven luciferase constructs with C or G in the position of rs975484 (Fig. 2A) and expressed them in THP-1 cells. We found that C-to-G substitution results in an approximately 2-fold increase in luciferase mRNA expression (Fig. 2B), similar to the PRMT1 mRNA expression difference between GG and CC genotypes in human monocytes (Fig. 1B). Next we performed bioinformatic analysis of transcription factor binding to this promoter region (TfSiteScan, RRID:SCR_010667). We identified an extra C/EBPβ binding motif in the G but not in the C variant (Fig. 2C). To evaluate the role of C/EBPβ in PRMT1 expression, we coexpressed PRMT1 promoter–driven luciferase in the presence of control shRNA or shRNAs specific to CEBPB (Fig. 2D and S2A). We found that C/EBPβ knockdown significantly reduced G construct expression, suggesting that C/EBPβ binding to the PRMT1 promoter promotes its expression. Next we confirmed C/EBPβ binding to the PRMT1 promoter by ChIP in THP-1 cells expressing a C or G promoter construct. We found that C-to-G substitution results in a 3-fold increase in C/EBPβ binding to the PRMT1 promoter immediately upstream of the transcription start site (P1_I) (Fig. 2E). No binding was observed to the region downstream of the transcription start site (P1_II). Interestingly, we also detected C/EBPβ binding to the C construct promoter, in agreement with bioinformatic analysis prediction. However, CEBPB knockdown did not decrease C construct expression. These data suggest that either the other C/EBPβ binding sites are nonfunctional or, alternatively, that loss of C/EBPβ binding results in an increase in binding of another transcription factor, such as NF-κB. Fig. S2B shows data to support the second hypothesis. C/EBPβ knockdown results in a 7-fold increase in PRMT1 expression in response to lipopolysaccharide. Similarly, in blood monocytes, GG monocytes (more C/EBPβ binding) showed lower PRMT1 mRNA expression in response to lipopolysaccharide compared with CC monocytes (less C/EBPβ binding) (Fig. S2C). We did not find a significant correlation between PRMT1 polymorphisms and PRMT1 mRNA in total human HCC mRNA from individual specimens (Fig. 3A). In contrast, we found that PRMT1 expression in tumor-associated macrophages, measured as number of PRMT1-positive TAMs per field, was significantly different between individuals with the GG>GC>CC rs975484 genotype (Fig. 3, B and C). The number of total TAMs per field was not significantly different between genotypes (Fig. 3C). Similar results were observed for the rs10411771 and rs8109314 genotypes. The rs10415880 genotype also correlated with the number of PRMT1-positive TAMs, and this correlation was independent from rs975484 in a multivariate analysis, whereas rs1045567, rs10411771, and rs8109314 correlation with PRMT1 was not significant in the multivariate analysis. Interestingly, rs3816047 minor allele individuals had higher expression of PRMT1 than individuals with a major allele, in contrast to the results for blood monocytes (Fig. 3D). Our previous work has demonstrated that PRMT1 is an important regulator of immune signaling in multiple cell types, including monocytes, liver macrophages, hepatocytes, liver tumor–associated macrophages, and hepatoma cells (8Tikhanovich I.

In human HCC, PRMT1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis (Fig. S3), suggesting that PRMT1 might promote tumor growth. One of the PRMT1 targets we found in the liver is PD-L2 (10Zhao J. O'Neil M. Vittal A. Weinman S.A. Tikhanovich I. PRMT1-dependent macrophage IL-6 production is required for alcohol-induced HCC progression.Gene Expr. 2019; 19 (30236171): 137-15010.3727/105221618X15372014086197Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To test the role of PRMT1 in immune checkpoint regulation in the liver, we examined the gene expression of PRMT1 and immune checkpoint ligands in human HCC. We found significant correlation between PRMT1 expression and expression of genes coding for PD-L1 (CD274), PD-L2 (PDCD1L2), and others (VSIR or C10orf54 coding for VISTA, CD276 coding for B7-H3, TNFRSF14 coding for HVEM, and LGALS9 coding for GAL-9) (Fig. 4A and Fig. S4) in two different data sets: GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Analysis) (19Tang Z. Li C. Kang B. Gao G. Li C. Zhang Z. GEPIA: a web server for cancer and normal gene expression profiling and interactive analyses.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28407145): W98-W10210.1093/nar/gkx247Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar) and Human Protein Atlas (RRID:SCR_006710). We found similar results in HCC specimens from the University of Kansas Medical Center liver bank (Fig. S5). Interestingly, we did not find any correlation in other types of tumors (Fig. S6). Next we determined whether PRMT1 regulates expression of these genes in a mouse model of HCC. PRMT1 floxed male mice were given DEN to induce HCC formation. At 6 months of age, mice were injected with AAV-control or AAV-Cre with Cre recombinase driven by a CMV, promoter and liver tumors were analyzed at 8 months of age (Fig. S7). AAV-CMV.Cre has broad cell type specificity, but the efficiency of knockout reached only 50%–80%. We confirmed that mice that received AAV-Cre lost expression of PRMT1 in tumor cells (Fig. 4B and Fig. S7). These tumors in PRMT1 knockout mice also lost immunohistochemically detectible expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 proteins (Fig. 4B), which corresponded to significantly reduced mRNA expression of genes coding for PD-L1 and PD-L2 in whole-tumor mRNA (Fig. 4B). WT and knockout littermates were treated every 2 weeks with four total injections of PD-1–specific antibodies at 12.5 mg/kg starting 1 week after AAV injection (Fig. 4C). PD-1 antibody treatment efficiently prevented tumor formation in WT mice. In liver sections of treated mice, we did not find tumor nodules. In contrast, PRMT1 knockout mice showed no effect of PD-1 treatment. We observed multiple tumors on the surface and within liver sections (Fig. 4C). The tumor number in anti-PD-1–treated mice correlated with PRMT1 expression in these mice, suggesting that PRMT1-dependent checkpoint regulation is a determinant of PD-1 treatment efficiency (Fig. 4C). The above results clearly show that PRMT1-dpendent regulation of the PD-1 pathway regulates tumor growth. To determine which cell(s) participate in this PRMT1 effect, we generated a series of cell-specific PRMT1 knockouts. To knock out PRMT1 in tumor cells, we used AAV.TBG.Cre-mediated cre delivery to adult PRMT1 floxed mice at 6 months of age prior to tumor development. AAV injection results in hepatocyte-specific knockout and tumor cell–specific knockout in HCCs in these mice (20Zhao J. Adams A. Roberts B. O'Neil M. Vittal A. Schmitt T. Kumer S. Cox J. Li Z. Weinman S.A. Tikhanovich I. PRMT1 and JMJD6 dependent arginine methylation regulate HNF4 expression and hepatocyte proliferation.Hepatology. 2018; 67 (29023917): 1109-112610.1002/hep.29587Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Littermates were injected with AAV.TBG.cre or AAV.TBG.control vectors and developed tumors that were WT or tumor cell–specific PRMT1 knockout 2 months after AAV injection. We found that PRMT1 knockout tumors had significantly lower expression of genes coding for PD-L1 and GAL9 (Fig. 4D). In isolated liver macrophages from PRMT1 WT or myeloid-specific PRMT1 knockout littermates (10Zhao J. O'Neil M. Vittal A. Weinman S.A. Tikhanovich I. PRMT1-dependent macrophage IL-6 production is required for alcohol-induced HCC progression.Gene Expr. 2019; 19 (30236171): 137-15010.3727/105221618X15372014086197Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we found significant differences in expression of genes coding for PD-L1, PD-L2, HVEM, and B7-H3 (Fig. S8). We analyzed tumors from PRMT1 WT or myeloid-specific PRMT1 knockout littermates at 9 months of age. We found that tumors from myeloid-specific PRMT1 knockout mice had significantly lower expression of genes coding for PD-L1, PD-L2, and HVEM (Fig. 4E). We analyzed tumors from PRMT1 WT or dendritic cell–specific PRMT1 knockout littermates. PRMT1 WT or dendritic cell–specific PRMT1 knockout littermates (PRMT1 flox/flox cd11c-Cre) were injected with DEN at 2 weeks of age, and livers were analyzed at 9 months of age. We found that tumors from PRMT1 DC-KO mice had significantly lower expression of genes coding for B7-H3 and GAL9 (Fig. 4F). We confirmed the gene expression data by staining (Fig. 5). We found that tumors from PRMT1 hepatocyte-specific knockout mice had significantly less PD-L1 and PD-L2 compared with WT controls (Fig. 5A). Similarly, myeloid cell–specific knockout mice had significantly less PD-L1 and PD-L2 in tumor nodules compared with WT controls (Fig. 5B). In contrast, DC-KO mice and WT littermates had comparable PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in the tumors (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these data suggest that PRMT1 regulates expression of multiple immune checkpoint genes in tumor cells as well as in immune cells such as macrophages. Finally we tested whether PRMT1 promoter polymorphisms correlate with PRMT1-dependent immune checkpoint gene expression in human HCC (Fig. 6). We found that the rs975484 genotype correlates best with immune checkpoint gene expression. Among other SNPs, rs10415880 showed a weak correlation with immune checkpoint expression (Fig. S9). The rs975484 genotype correlates with mRNA expression of genes coding for PD-L2 and VISTA (Fig. 6A). Correlation with genes coding for PD-L1 showed a trend but did not reach statistical significance. We found no correlation with genes coding for B7-H3, GAL-9, or HVEM (Fig. 6A). We analyzed protein expression in these HCC specimens by staining and found that individuals with the GG genotype had significantly higher levels of PD-L1, PD-L2, and VISTA but not B7-H3 (Fig. 6, B and C). Additionally, we found that individuals with the GG genotype had significantly increased numbers of TIM3-positive exhausted T cells (Fig. 6, B and C). PRMT1 is an arginine methyltransferase that regulates many proteins directly and many more via histone arginine methylation. Recently, we and others found that PRMT1 is an immune regulator. Its targets include, but are not limited to, TRAF6, NF-κB, PPARγ, c-Myc, STAT3, FOXOs, and β-catenin, all of which are involved in immune cell regulation; specifically, immune cell polarization (7Hassa P.O.

Thus, it is not surprising that PRMT1 is involved in regulation of the tumor immune environment. Specifically, we found that it regulates immune responses in hepatocellular carcinoma (10Zhao J. O'Neil M. Vittal A. Weinman S.A. Tikhanovich I. PRMT1-dependent macrophage IL-6 production is required for alcohol-induced HCC progression.Gene Expr. 2019; 19 (30236171): 137-15010.3727/105221618X15372014086197Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this work, we found that, in HCC, PRMT1 regulates expression of immune checkpoint genes in a cell type–specific manner. We examined the cell types that are known to express PD-L1 and PD-L2 and found that PRMT1 regulates different subsets of immune checkpoint genes in macrophages, DCs, and HCC tumor cells. PRMT1 promotes the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in tumor cells and macrophages in DEN-induced tumors in mice. Interestingly, PRMT1 knockout mice did not show reduced tumor numbers despite a decrease in immune checkpoint ligands. This suggests that PD-L1/PD-L2–low tumors have alternative mechanisms for immune evasion. These data agree with studies published previously (17Yi M. Jiao D. Xu H. Liu Q. Zhao W. Ha"
https://openalex.org/W3014672154,"Because of a lack of preference-based health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments suitable for infants aged 0-12 months, we previously developed the Infant QoL Instrument (IQI). The present study aimed to generate an algorithm to estimate utilities for the IQI.Via an online survey, respondents from the general population and primary caregivers from China-Hong Kong, the UK, and the USA were presented 10 discrete choice scenarios based on the IQI classification system. An additional sample of respondents from the general population were also asked if they considered the examined health states to be worse than death. Coefficients for the IQI item levels were obtained with a conditional logit model based on the responses of the primary caregivers for IQI states only. These coefficients were then normalized using the rank-ordered logit model based on the responses from the general population who assessed ""death"" as a choice option. In this way, the values were rescaled from full health (1.0) to death (0.0), and consequently, they became suitable for the computation of quality-adjusted life years.The total sample consisted of 1409 members of the general population and 1229 primary caregivers. Results indicated that, out of the 7 IQI items (""sleeping,"" ""feeding,"" ""breathing,"" ""stooling/poo,"" ""mood,"" ""skin,"" and ""interaction""), ""breathing"" had the highest impact on the HRQoL of infants. Moreover, except for ""stooling,"" all item levels were statistically significant. The general population sample considered none of the health states as worse than death. The utility value for the worst health state was 0.015 (State 4444444).The IQI is the first generic instrument to assess overall HRQoL in 0-1-year-old infants by providing values and utilities. Using discrete choice experiments, we demonstrated that it is possible to derive utilities of infant health states. The next step will be to collect IQI values in a clinical population of infants and to compare these values with those of other instruments."
https://openalex.org/W3014302155,"Spatial conservation prioritization concerns trade-offs between marine conservation and resource exploitation. This approach has been increasingly used to devise spatial management strategies for fisheries because of its simplicity in the optimization model and less data requirement compared to complex dynamic models. However, most of the prioritization is based on static models or algorithms; whose solutions need to be evaluated in a dynamic approach, considering the high uncertainty and opportunity costs associated with their implementation. We developed a framework that integrates species distribution models, spatial conservation prioritization tools and a general grid-based dynamic model (Grid-DM) to support evaluation of ecological and economic trade-offs of candidate conservation plans. The Grid-DM is spatially explicit and has a tactical management focus on single species. We applied the Grid-DM to small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) in Haizhou Bay, China and validated its spatial and temporal performances against historical observations. It was linked to a spatial conservation prioritization tool Marxan to illustrate how the model can be used for conservation strategy evaluation. The simulation model demonstrated effectiveness in capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of the target fishery as well as the socio-ecological effects of conservation measures. We conclude that the model has the capability and flexibility to address various forms of uncertainties, simulate the dynamics of a targeted fishery, and to evaluate biological and socioeconomic impacts of management plans. The modelling platform can further inform scientists and policy makers of management alternatives screening and adaptive conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W3015091190,"Plastic toys mouthed by children may be a source of exposure to endocrine active substances. The purpose of this study was to measure hormonal activity of substances leaching from toys and to identify potential endocrine disruptors causing that activity. For this purpose, migration experiments of toys were conducted in saliva simulants. The CALUX® assays were used to detect (anti-) estrogenic and (anti-) androgenic activity of 18 toys. Chemical trace analysis–namely, GC-MS and HPLC-MS- was used to identify which compounds may be responsible for endocrine activity in the sample migrates. Nine out of 18 tested toys showed significant estrogenic activity. For two samples, the detected estrogenic activity could be well explained by detecting the known endocrine active substance bisphenol A (BPA). For all identified substances, including BPA, a risk assessment for human health was performed by comparing the exposure dose, calculated based on the determined substance concentration, to toxicological reference values. Using worst-case scenarios, the exposure to BPA by mouthing of the two estrogen active, BPA-containing toys could be above the temporary TDI that EFSA has calculated. This demonstrates that some toys could significantly contribute to the total exposure to BPA of babies and infants. For seven out of nine estrogen active samples, the source of the estrogen activity could not be explained by analysis for 41 known or suspected endocrine active substances in plastic, indicating that the estrogen activities were caused by currently unknown endocrine active substances, or by endocrine active substances that would currently not be suspected in toys."

https://openalex.org/W3015115623,"Substance use disorders (SUD) in physicians often remain concealed for a long time. Peer monitoring and open discussions with colleagues are essential for identifying SUD. However, physicians often feel uncomfortable discussing substance use with a colleague. We explored physicians' attitudes and norms about substance use (disorders) and their (intended) approach upon a presumption of substance use in a colleague.An online cross-sectional survey concerning ""Addiction in physicians"" was administered by the Royal Dutch Medical Association physician panel. Overall, 1685 physicians (47%) responded. Data were analyzed by logistic regression to explore factors associated with taking action upon a substance use presumption.Most physicians agreed that SUD can happen to anyone (67%), is not a sign of weakness (78%) and that it is a disease that can be treated (83%). Substance use in a working context was perceived as unacceptable (alcohol at work: 99%, alcohol during a standby duty: 91%, alcohol in the eight hours before work: 77%, and illicit drugs in the eight hours before work: 97%). Almost all respondents (97%) intend to act upon a substance use presumption in a colleague. Of the 29% who ever had this presumption, 65% took actual action. Actual action was associated with male gender and older age (OR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.20-2.74 and OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01-1.05, respectively).About one-third of physicians reported experience with a presumption of substance use in a colleague. Whilst most physicians intend to take action upon such a presumption, two-thirds actually do act upon a presumption. To bridge this intention-behavior gap continued medical education on signs and symptoms of SUD and instructions on how to enter a supportive dialogue with a colleague about personal issues, may enhance physicians' knowledge, confidence, and ethical responsibility to act upon a presumption of substance use or other concerns in a colleague."

This prospective cohort study included 112 patients with acute tonsillitis (AT) and PTA recruited at a tertiary hospital emergency department between February and October 2017. All patients completed a questionnaire concerning their current disease. Serum amylase (S-Amyl) and C-reactive protein (S-CRP) levels, tonsillar findings, and pus aspirate samples and throat cultures were analyzed. Eight of 58 PTA patients (13.8%) had no signs of tonsillar infection. The absence of tonsillar erythema and exudate was associated with low S-CRP (p<0.001) and older age (p<0.001). We also observed an inverse correlation between S-Amyl and S-CRP levels (AT, r = -0.519; PTA, r = -0.353). Therefore, we observed a group of PTA patients without signs of tonsillar infection who had significantly lower S-CRP levels than other PTA patients. These findings support that PTA may be caused by an etiology other than AT. Variations in the S-Amyl levels and a negative correlation between S-Amyl and S-CRP levels may indicate that minor salivary glands are involved in PTA development."

RP is a blinding condition resulting from the progressive loss of photoreceptors. Since over 300 different mutations (e.g. in the Rhodopsin gene) can give rise to the RP phenotype, there is a need for a broad-spectrum neuroprotective strategy (12Baranov P. Lin H. McCabe K. Gale D. Cai S. Lieppman B. Morrow D. Lei P. Liao J. Young M. A novel neuroprotective small molecule for glial cell derived neurotrophic factor induction and photoreceptor rescue.J. Ocul. Pharmacol.

The reasons for slow therapeutic progress include poor pharmacokinetics, stability, and distribution. This means it must be given continuously to be efficacious, and the potential for side effects is a concern. Another problem is related to the way by which GDNF activates trophic signals. GDNF must bind to a receptor GFRa and only then it can activate a receptor tyrosine kinase RET, which mediates the trophic signals. This requirement by GDNF of a co-receptor narrows the breadth of responding cells to those that can access both subunits. A small molecule selective activator of RET, irrespective of GFRa expression, might circumvent all these therapeutic problems. Moreover, such molecules could be used as chemical-biology tools to evaluate RET–GFRa functional interactions. In the present work we report the development of novel substituted naphthoquinones along with their corresponding quinoline forms and show that they act as selective agonists for the RET tyrosine kinase receptor, activating the downstream effectors Akt and Erk. Some agents are agonistic regardless of whether or not the GFRa1 receptor is present. For other agents, GFRa1 receptor expression causes biased RET signaling with differential effects upon pAkt and pErk activation, and this can be regulated positively or negatively by the reported GFRa1 modulator XIB4035. A GFRa1-independent RET agonist Q525 was neuroprotective in a mouse model of RP, generating trophic signals in vivo within the Muller glial cell population, thus validating RET as a druggable therapeutic target and suggesting potential utility for therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. All compounds and structures are summarized in Table 1 in the order that they are mentioned. Biochemical assays revealed that the chlorinated methoxy 1,4-naphthoquinone Q121 activated pAkt and pErk in MG87 RET/GFRa1 cells. Q121 induced RET phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (blots were probed using mAb 4G10 for total pTyr residues) (Fig. 1A). Compound Q128 with an (–OH) substituting the (–OCH3) group of Q121 was inactive (Fig. 1A), indicating the functional relevance of the –OCH3 adduct. These data provide a rationale for further substitutions of the core structure at this position.Table 1Overview and compound structures Open table in a new tab Figure 1Screening and structure–activity relationship of naphthoquinone RET activators. A, compound Q121 and Q128 activity in MG87 RET/GFRa1 cells. Following serum starvation, the cells were exposed for 20 min to vehicle, 10 ng/ml GDNF, or compounds at the indicated micromolar range. The lysates were collected and probed for pAkt, pErk, and total phosphotyrosine (4G10). Representative Western blotting data are shown. Actin was probed as internal loading standard. B, representative total RET immunoprecipitation from MG87 RET cells transfected with either GFRa1 or GFP control. Q121 treatment results in RET phosphorylation at concentrations of 50 and 100 μm in the cells expressing GFRa1. Total RET was probed as internal loading standard. For MG76 RET/GFRa1 cells, G represents GDNF as positive control. For MG87 RET/GFP, G+a1 represents GDNF+ GFRa1 co-treatment, which is needed to induce RET phosphorylation in these cells lacking GFRa. C, activities of naphthoquinone derivatives. Side-chain modifications generated compounds active in MG87 RET/GFRa1 as demonstrated by the representative Western blotting. D, the naphthoquinone derivatives are also active in MG87 TrkA cells as demonstrated by the representative Western blotting. E, compound Q151 induces RET phosphorylation in both MG87 RET/GFRa1 and in RET/GFP cells lacking GFRa1. F, MG87 RET/GFRa1 cells in SFM were treated with Q2003 and Q2004 alone or in combination with suboptimal GDNF (GDNF SO, 5 ng/ml). Survival was assessed by MTT after 72 h.

Both compounds had low but significantly trophic activity at a concentration of 1 μm but did not potentiate suboptimal NGF. The data are expressed as percentages of survival ± S.D. from four experiments, with the respective optimal trophic factor (GF O, 30 ng/ml) standardized to 100% and vehicle to 0%. *, vehicle versus all treatments; #, suboptimal GF versus optimal GF; +, suboptimal GF versus all treatments.

Phospho-RET was significantly increased by treatment of 100 μm. However, in MG87 RET cells lacking GFRa1, there were no increases in RET phosphorylation detected above background vehicle control (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that Q121, like GDNF, requires GFRa1 to signal through RET. Compounds coded Q101, Q105, Q112, Q141, Q143, Q151, and Q1047 were then synthesized (see “Materials and Methods” and supporting text) and evaluated in biochemical assays. Significant increases in pAkt and pErk were observed with compounds Q105, Q112, Q141, Q151, and Q1047, whereas Q101 and Q143 were inactive (Fig. 1C). However, counterassays using MG87 cells expressing the NGF receptor TrkA tyrosine kinase (instead of RET) showed significant activation of pAkt and pErk, even though RET is absent. This indicates that these quinone derivatives lack selectivity (Fig. 1D). Despite poor RET selectivity, compounds such as Q151 remained interesting because they induced RET phosphorylation whether or not the GFRa1 co-receptor was present (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that the modifications to the side chain of position A (Table 1) allows GFRa1 independence. One concern with these agents is that significant cytotoxicity was observed in the 1–10 μm range when these compounds were screened via the MTT survival assay; this was therefore addressed in further analogs. To address cytotoxicity, we evaluated substitutions of the chlorine atom at position B (Table 1) because the ring-associated chlorine can enhance chemical reactivity and oxidative toxicity (2Bolton J.L. Dunlap T. Formation and biological targets of quinones: cytotoxic versus cytoprotective effects.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2017; 30 (27617882): 13-3710.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00256Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Compounds Q2003 and Q2004, bearing a hydrogen in place of the chlorine, were prepared. Biochemical assays revealed these compounds to be significantly less potent, with nonsignificant pAkt/pErk activation even when assayed at a high μm concentration range (data not shown). Moreover, in biological assays measuring cell survival, both Q2003 and Q2004 displayed weak trophic activity, which was nonselective and was detectable in MG87 RET/GRFa1 as well as in MG87 TrkA cells. In MTT assays Q2003 and Q2004 supported cell viability to 8–18% of the survival induced by optimal growth factor concentrations (GDNF for RET/GRFa1-expressing cells and NGF for TrkA-expressing cells) (Fig. 1, F and G). Although Q2003 and Q2004 lacked potency and selectivity, they remained interesting because their activity was additive in MG87 RET/GRFa1 with suboptimal doses of GDNF (Fig. 1F), and this effect was not observed in MG87 TrkA with suboptimal doses of NGF (Fig. 1G). Therefore, although the survival induced by Q2003 and Q2004 can be RET-independent (i.e. the compounds afford survival to MG87 TrkA cells), the RET/GDNF axis is involved in the functional outcome because the agents potentiate GDNF trophic action, but they do not potentiate NGF trophic action. To assess the basis of toxicity by some compounds, MTT assays were performed with cells growing in serum to assess negative effects on growth/survival over 72 h. At 1 μm, both Q2003 and Q2004 (lacking the chlorine) showed no signs of causing cell death (Fig. 2). In contrast, Q1047, identical to Q2003 but including the chlorine, was significantly toxic. Toxicity was comparable for MG87 RET/GFRa1 and MG87 TrkA cells, indicating that the toxicity is from a RET-independent mechanism. Knowing that the presence of the chlorine is tied with potency, we designed structural modifications that preserve that position but reduce toxicity. Synthesis and evaluation of Q525 showed that is significantly less toxic than Q1047. Q525 was selected for further studies. In summary, simple side-chain substitutions of the naphthoquinone core resulted in RET-activating compounds, and although lacking RET selectivity the compounds did not require GFRa1 co-expression. The chlorine is associated with the potency of the compounds but also with the toxicity. Removal of the chlorine generated less potent compounds, and although RET selectivity was still not achieved, the compounds were considerably less toxic and had the ability to cooperate with GDNF. These observations prompted further chemical design of the naphthoquinone core in efforts to improve RET selectivity. To improve upon this first generation of molecules, we synthesized quinoline derivatives bearing identical side chains to their naphthoquinone counterparts. This effort generated new chemical entities with a nitrogen at position C (Table 1). These compounds are chemically distinguished from known inhibitors of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases), to exclude this as a possible factor in the poor selectivity of the first-generation molecules. Q525 (and Q508) were screened in biochemical assays. Q525 was active in MG87 RET/GFRa1 cells across a broad range of concentrations and generated large and significant increases in pAkt/pErk (Fig. 3A; quantified in Fig. 3B). The compound maintained a high degree of selectivity for RET, because no significant increases in pAkt and pErk were observed in MG87 TrkA cells (Fig. 3C; quantified in Fig. 3D). The improved selectivity of the quinoline series (e.g. Q525) is exemplified by a lack of selectivity in Q1047 (the naphthoquinone form of Q525), which activates signals in MG87 TrkA cells (Fig. 2C). Additionally, analogs Q1041 and Q1048 bearing a quinoxaline motif with N-substitutions at both positions C and D (Table 1) were synthesized and found to be inactive at all concentrations tested. Together, these data suggest that the N-substitution in the ring system has a significant impact on compound selectivity, generating agents that maintain RET activity and GFRa1 independence. We used the GFRa1-independent RET agonists as chemical-biology tools to study the influence of the GFRa1 co-receptor upon RET signaling. We evaluated the quinone/quinoline pairs Q1047/Q525 and Q112/Q508 in combination with XIB4035, which is a reported GFRa1 modulator with no agonistic activity on its own (19Hedstrom K.L. Murtie J.C. Albers K. Calcutt N.A. Corfas G. Treating small fiber neuropathy by topical application of a small molecule modulator of ligand-induced GFRα/RET receptor signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (24449858): 2325-233010.1073/pnas.1308889111Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Suboptimal doses (10 μm) of Q1047 (nonselective agonist) or Q525 (selective RET agonist) generated low but significant increases in both pAkt and pErk, compared with control vehicle or to 4 μm XIB4035, which did not activate signals (Fig. 4A). Compared with single treatments, a combination of 4 μm XIB4035 + 10 μm of Q1047 or Q525 resulted in significant increases of pErk signals (50 and 100%, respectively) (Fig. 4B), whereas pAkt levels were unaffected (Fig. 4C). These data suggest a RET-mediated pErk bias when GFRa1 is modulated by XIB4035. Suboptimal doses (10 μm) of Q112 (nonselective agonist) or Q508 (selective RET agonist) generated low but significant increases in both pAkt and pErk, compared with control vehicle or to 4 μm XIB4035. A combination with 4 μm XIB4035 caused a reduction by 50% of the pAkt that was induced by Q112 or Q508 alone (Fig. 4C) while leaving pErk unaffected (Fig. 4B). Hence, a GFRa1 modulator XIB4035 alters the signals induced by RET agonists, even when these agonists do not require GFRa1 to signal on their own. In one case (Q1047 or Q525) it enhances pErk signals but does not affect pAkt, and in another case (Q112 or Q508) it decreases pAkt signals but does not affect pErk. The end result for both families of compounds is a pErk signaling bias; however, this is likely achieved through different mechanisms that involve a ligand-mediated regulation of RET by the GFRa1 receptor. Also, it is of interest that N-substitution in the ring of structurally related quinone/quinoline pairs does not affect regulation of signaling by XIB4035. Several naphthoquinones have been reported as inhibitors of PTPases, some nonselective (3Klotz L.O. Hou X. Jacob C. 1,4-naphthoquinones: from oxidative damage to cellular and inter-cellular signaling.Molecules. 2014; 19 (25232709): 14902-1491810.3390/molecules190914902Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and some with a degree of selectivity (4Perron M.D. Chowdhury S. Aubry I. Purisima E. Tremblay M.L. Saragovi H.U. Allosteric noncompetitive small molecule selective inhibitors of CD45 tyrosine phosphatase suppress T-cell receptor signals and inflammation in vivo.Mol. Pharmacol. 2014; 85 (24473749): 553-56310.1124/mol.113.089847Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). RET activation could potentially stem from inhibition of PTPases, and we evaluated this possibility. Select compounds were tested in assays of PTPase activity to evaluate their impact upon the enzymatic activity of five PTPase enzymes (LAR, PTP-sigma, PTP-1B, MKPX, and SHP-1) as described (4Perron M.D. Chowdhury S. Aubry I. Purisima E. Tremblay M.L. Saragovi H.U. Allosteric noncompetitive small molecule selective inhibitors of CD45 tyrosine phosphatase suppress T-cell receptor signals and inflammation in vivo.Mol. Pharmacol. 2014; 85 (24473749): 553-56310.1124/mol.113.089847Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The compounds did not affect the activity of purified PTPases compared with DMSO vehicle, whereas the positive control sodium orthovanadate showed significant inhibition of >80% (Table 2). The 40 μm compound concentrations evaluated in these PTPase assays are at least 3-fold higher than the compound concentrations that induce biological signals in cultured cells and likely much higher than compound concentrations inside the cell, where PTPases are present.Table 2Ability of select compounds to inhibit phosphatasesQ numberLARD1D2SigmaD1D2PTP1BMKPXSHP-110597987799.58711291.596.5121.5978012196.597.5939890143969910196.5103.5508727192.596.59152597.599.5969994Na3VO416.52445DMSO9997.599.59993 Open table in a new tab In particular we note lack of inhibition by the quinone/quinoline pairs Q1047/Q525 and Q112/Q508, neither of which affected any of the five PTPases tested. Moreover, the fact that XIB4035 (a GFRa1 modulator with no reported link to PTPases) regulates pErk signals induced by Q1047/Q525 and Q112/Q508 (Fig. 4) is consistent with the notion that these agents are not PTPase inhibitors. We selected Q525 for pharmacological evaluation in vivo in the transgenic mutant RHOP347S mice (expressing a mutant rhodopsin gene that causes retinitis pigmentosa). These mice undergo rapid photoreceptor apoptosis that peaks in vivo between postnatal days 18 and 22 (20Li T. Snyder W.K. Olsson J.E. Dryja T.P. Transgenic mice carrying the dominant rhodopsin mutation P347S: evidence for defective vectorial transport of rhodopsin to the outer segments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93 (8943080): 14176-1418110.1073/pnas.93.24.14176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The rate of photoreceptor apoptosis is fully replicated ex vivo in cultured whole retinal explants from these mice, allowing rapid testing of many compounds and doses. Retinal explants were prepared from 18-day-old mice and incubated for 24 h with either compounds or vehicle, followed by quantification of TUNEL staining. Representative confocal images of the central retinal region are shown (Fig. 5A). Q525 at a 20 μm dose affords robust preservation of the photoreceptors, as indicated by a 40% reduction in TUNEL+ cells in this layer (Fig. 5B). In controls, the inactive compound Q143, assayed previously (Fig. 1C), was indistinguishable from vehicle-treated retinas. The data support the notion that RET activation by Q525 may be a disease-modifying strategy for degenerative conditions like RP. To understand the neuroprotective mechanism of action, we studied activation of biochemical pathways in the retina. Mice (n = 3) received intravitreally administered test compound in one eye and control vehicle in the contralateral eye. Eyecups were collected 1 h later and examined by immunohistochemistry to quantify pErk and pAkt signals. The results show that the Q525-treated eyes had elevated levels of pErk and pAkt by 1.8- and 2.0-fold, respectively, whereas no significant elevations in pErk or pAkt were observed in animals injected with the inactive Q143 (Fig. 5, E and F). This is consistent with biochemical assays using cell lines (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). The pAkt and pErk signals co-localized with the Müller cell marker CRALBP. This indicates that the Müller glial cells are among the primary cellular targets for the RET agonists, and these cells are known to express RET and to support the health of photoreceptors. We discovered a series of new chemical entities, naphthoquinone/quinoline derivatives with agonistic activity at the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. Employing them as biological tools, we explored functional regulation between RET and its co-receptor GFRa1. A summary of screening and biochemical data is provided in Table 3.Table 3Summary of pharmacological profilesTestPotencyRET selectivityGFRa1-dependentToxicityGDNF+++++++Yes—121+++Yes++128++—++101++—+++105+++No+++112++++No+++141+++No+++143+——+++151+++No+++1047++++No+++2003++—+2004++—+508+++++No+525++++++No+1041+———1048+——— Open table in a new tab We demonstrated that although these agents do not require the presence of GFRa1, their signaling profiles can be nuanced by the presence and bound state of GFRa1. The regulatory functions that the GFRa subunits exert over RET provide additional points to consider when using RET agonists for therapy. We also showed the neuroprotective efficacy of a lead agent, Q525, in a model of RP neurodegeneration; further validating RET as a potential therapeutic target. The finding that the relatively simple naphthoquinone Q121 was a weak RET agonist but required GFRa1 expression was surprising, given its extremely small size compared with GDNF and the large surface of interactions of the receptor complex. Large growth factors like GDNF are typically envisioned as mediating a “bridge” between receptor components, bringing them in close proximity through multiple contact points and stabilizing an active conformation. It is unlikely that small molecules are capable of fully replicating this. The literature suggests that RET and GFRa1 associate in a ligand-independent manner (21Sanicola M. Hession C. Worley D. Carmillo P. Ehrenfels C. Walus L. Robinson S. Jaworski G. Wei H. Tizard R. Whitty A. Pepinsky R.B. Cate R.L. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor-dependent RET activation can be mediated by two different cell-surface accessory proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The substitution of the methoxy group for a hydroxyl abrogated RET activity and clearly implicated this position for synthesis of analogs. However, further screening of these naphthoquinone derivatives, although biochemically interesting, did not possess the RET selectivity worthy of pursuit. It is unclear how the compounds activate pAkt and pErk in non–RET-expressing cells, but the pote"
https://openalex.org/W3014824987,"Background The incidence and etiologies of chronic pulmonary infection (CPI) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have been poorly investigated. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of 659 patients with IPF to assess the incidence, etiologies, and risk factors of CPI development. CPI was defined if the etiology of infection was diagnosed one or more months after the onset of symptoms or upon the appearance of new shadows on pulmonary radiological images. Results At IPF diagnosis, 36 (5.5%) patients had CPI, and 46 (7.0%) patients without CPI at IPF diagnosis developed CPI over a median follow-up period of 6.1 years. The incidence density of CPI development was 18.90 cases per 1000 person-years. Detected organisms from these 46 patients were Mycobacterium avium complex in 20 patients, other nontuberculous mycobacteria in 4, M. tuberculosis in 7, Aspergillus spp. in 22, and Nocardia sp. in one. In a multivariate Cox regression hazard model, PaO2 <70 Torr and KL-6 ≥2000 U/mL were associated with CPI development. Conclusions Nontuberculous mycobacteria, M. tuberculosis, and Aspergillus and Nocardia spp. were the four most frequent etiologies of CPI in patients with IPF. During follow-up of IPF, clinicians should pay attention to the development of CPI, especially in patients with PaO2 <70 Torr or KL-6 ≥2000 U/mL."
https://openalex.org/W3015086124,"Introduction Sputum specimen decontamination steps are essential due to the presence of other saprophytic and infectious organisms. However, they negatively affect the mycobacterial recovery. In addition, little is known about the Mycobacterium tuberculosis killing efficacy of the PANTA (polymyxin-B, amphotericin-B, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, azilocillin) antibiotics. Moreover, M. tuberculosis can be present in more than one metabolic population, but the effect of different growth characteristics on the mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) based time-to-positive (TTP) is not well studied. Methods We performed—(1) experiments using the solid agar and MGIT method to determine the effect of the NALC-NaOH decontamination method, (2) concentration-response studies with each individual antibiotic in the PANTA, and (3) the effect of the M. tuberculosis metabolic population on the TTP. TTP was recorded using the Epicenter software and exponential growth equation was used to calculate the doubling time of the bacteria, whereas, CFU/mL was analyzed using the Inhibitory Sigmoid Emax model for each antibiotic. Results Decontamination resulted in 4.36+0.13 log10 CFU/mL difference in cultures treated with NALC-NaOH versus no decontamination process and the limit of detection decreased from 1.47 log10 CFU/mL to the 0.42 log10 CFU/mL following NALC-NaOH treatment. PANTA at currently used antibiotic concentrations, did not had negative effect on mycobacterial recovery. Exponential growth model estimated doubling time for the log-phase growth M. tuberculosis as 2.04 days, for the semi-dormant bacilli as 2.80 days, and 6.37 days for the anaerobic cultures. Conclusion Specimen decontamination method negatively affect the laboratory diagnosis of M. tuberculosis, polymyxin-B and nalidixic acid have anti-tuberculosis efficacy at high concentrations, and the doubling time of different metabolic population should be considered when deciding the time-in-protocol for the MGIT system."
https://openalex.org/W3014185513,"Meiosis and oocyte maturation are tightly regulated processes. The meiosis arrest female 1 (MARF1) gene is essential for meiotic progression in animals; however, its detailed function remains unclear. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism of dMarf1, a Drosophila homolog of MARF1 encoding an OST and RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) -containing protein for meiotic progression and oocyte maturation. Although oogenesis progressed in females carrying a dMarf1 loss-of-function allele, the dMarf1 mutant oocytes were found to contain arrested meiotic spindles or disrupted microtubule structures, indicating that the transition from meiosis I to II was compromised in these oocytes. The expression of the full-length dMarf1 transgene, but none of the variants lacking the OST and RRM motifs or the 47 conserved C-terminal residues among insect groups, rescued the meiotic defect in dMarf1 mutant oocytes. Our results indicate that these conserved residues are important for dMarf1 function. Immunoprecipitation of Myc-dMarf1 revealed that several mRNAs are bound to dMarf1. Of those, the protein expression of nanos (nos), but not its mRNA, was affected in the absence of dMarf1. In the control, the expression of Nos protein became downregulated during the late stages of oogenesis, while it remained high in dMarf1 mutant oocytes. We propose that dMarf1 translationally represses nos by binding to its mRNA. Furthermore, the downregulation of Nos induces cycB expression, which in turn activates the CycB/Cdk1 complex at the onset of oocyte maturation."

However, there is a limited demonstration of a co-culture induction system utilizing stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes as a stimulatory source for cardiac reprogramming (of stem cells or otherwise). In this study, we utilized an inductive co-culture method to show that previously differentiated induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs), when co-cultivated with iPS cells, constituted a sufficient stimulatory system to induce cardiac differentiation. To enable tracking of both cell populations, we utilized GFP-labeled iPS cells and non-labeled iCMs pre-differentiated using inhibitors of GSK and Wnt signaling. Successful differentiation was assessed by the exhibition of spontaneous self-contractions, structural organization of α-actinin labeled sarcomeres, and expression of cardiac specific markers cTnT and α-actinin. We found that iCM-iPS cell-cell contact was essential for inductive differentiation, and this required overlaying already adherent iPS cells with iCMs. Importantly, this process was achieved without the exogenous addition of pathway inhibitors and morphogens, suggesting that 'older' iCMs serve as an adequate stimulatory source capable of recapitulating the necessary culture environment for cardiac differentiation."

Because Zika emerged in areas endemic for dengue and these related flaviviruses elicit cross-reactive antibodies, it is challenging to serologically monitor pregnant women for Zika infection. Methods A prospective cohort of 253 pregnant women was established in León, Nicaragua. Women were followed during prenatal care through delivery. Serologic specimens were obtained at each visit, and birth outcome was recorded. Established flavivirus serologic methods were adapted to determine Zika seroprevalence, and a stepwise testing algorithm estimated timing of Zika infection in relation to pregnancy. Results Zika seroprevalence was approximately 59% among women tested. Neutralization testing was highly concordant with Zika NS1 BOB results. Per study algorithm, 21% (40/187) of women were classified as experiencing Incident ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Importantly, the Incident ZIKV group included mostly women pregnant during the 2016 Zika epidemic peak and the only 3 subjects in the cohort with RT-PCR-confirmed infections. Approximately 17% of births had complications; 1.5% (3/194) manifesting clinical criteria of congenital Zika syndrome, one was RT-PCR-confirmed as a case of congenital Zika syndrome. Adverse birth outcome did not correlate with timing of Zika infection. Conclusions By leveraging prenatal care systems, we developed a simple algorithm for identifying women who were likely infected by Zika during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3014577573,"When speaking a foreign language, non-native speakers can typically be readily identified by their accents. But which aspects of the speech signal determine such accents? Speech pauses occur in all languages but may nonetheless vary in different languages with regard to their duration, number or positions in the speech stream, and therefore are one potential contributor to foreign speech production. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether non-native speakers pause ‘with a foreign accent’. We recorded native English speakers and non-native speakers of German or Serbo-Croatian with excellent English reading out an English text at three different speech rates, and analyzed their vocal output in terms of number, duration and location of pauses. Overall, all non-native speakers were identified by native raters as having non-native accents, but native and non-native speakers made pauses that were similarly long, and had similar ratios of pause time compared to total speaking time. Furthermore, all speakers changed their pausing behavior similarly at different speech rates. The only clear difference between native and non-native speakers was that the latter made more pauses than the native speakers. Thus, overall, pause patterns contributed little to the acoustic characteristics of speakers’ non-native accents, when reading aloud. Non-native pause patterns might be acquired more easily than other aspects of pronunciation because pauses are perceptually salient and producing pauses is easy. Alternatively, general cognitive processing mechanisms such as attention, planning or memory may constrain pausing behavior, allowing speakers to transfer their native pause patterns to a second language without significant deviation. We conclude that pauses make a relatively minor contribution to the acoustic characteristics of non-native accents."

H2Bub1 also is required for the trans-histone regulation of H3K4 and H3K79 methylation. Although previous studies have elucidated the basic mechanisms that establish and remove H2Bub1, we have only an incomplete understanding of how H2Bub1 is regulated. We report here that the histone H4 basic patch regulates H2Bub1. Yeast cells with arginine-to-alanine mutations in the H4 basic patch (H42RA) exhibited a significant loss of global H2Bub1. H42RA mutant yeast strains also displayed chemotoxin sensitivities similar to, but less severe than, strains containing a complete loss of H2Bub1. We found that the H4 basic patch regulates H2Bub1 levels independently of interactions with chromatin remodelers and separately from its regulation of H3K79 methylation. To measure H2B ubiquitylation and deubiquitination kinetics in vivo, we used a rapid and reversible optogenetic tool, the light-inducible nuclear exporter, to control the subcellular location of the H2Bub1 E3 ligase, Bre1. The ability of Bre1 to ubiquitylate H2B was unaffected in the H42RA mutant. In contrast, H2Bub1 deubiquitination by SAGA-associated Ubp8, but not by Ubp10, increased in the H42RA mutant. Consistent with a function for the H4 basic patch in regulating SAGA deubiquitinase activity, we also detected increased SAGA-mediated histone acetylation in H4 basic patch mutants.

https://openalex.org/W3014705199,"In respect to the heterogeneity among influenza A virus strains and the shortcomings of current vaccination programs, there is a huge interest in the development of alternative vaccines that provide a broader and more long-lasting protection. Gene-based approaches are considered as promising candidates for such flu vaccines. In our study, innate signalling molecules from the RIG-I and the NALP3 pathways were evaluated as genetic adjuvants in intramuscular DNA immunizations. Plasmids encoding a constitutive active form of RIG-I (cRIG-I), IPS-1, IL-1β, or IL-18 were co-administered with plasmids encoding the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein derived from H1N1/Puerto Rico/8/1934 via electroporation in BALB/c mice. Immunogenicity was analysed in detail and efficacy was demonstrated in homologous and heterologous influenza challenge experiments. Although the biological activities of the adjuvants have been confirmed by in vitro reporter assays, their single or combined inclusion in the vaccine did not result in superior vaccine efficacy. With the exception of significantly increased levels of antigen-specific IgG1 after the co-administration of IL-1β, there were only minor alterations concerning the immunogenicity. Since DNA electroporation alone induced substantial inflammation at the injection site, as demonstrated in this study using Mx2-Luc reporter mice, it might override the adjuvants´ contribution to the inflammatory microenvironment and thereby minimizes the influence on the immunogenicity. Taken together, the DNA immunization was protective against subsequent challenge infections but could not be further improved by the genetic adjuvants analysed in this study."

Research supports these conclusions in both U.S. and cross-cultural contexts, even though assumptions about parenting and the parent-child relationship may differ across cultures. However, for true understanding of cultural differences, it is important to have comparable measures across cultures. The purpose of the study is to assess measurement invariance of the two constructs of the Child-parent Relationship Scale using data gathered in programs serving low-income preschool children in the U.S.(n = 4,450) and Turkey (n = 592) from 2014 to 2015. Using Single-group Confirmatory Factor Analysis, the original factor structures of the Turkish and the English versions were tested. Besides, Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis provided evidence for configural, metric, scalar invariance, strict factorial invariance or error variance invariance and construct level invariance across the two versions. Only configural invariance was established, which showed an agreement for the existence of an underlying theoretical construct for each subscale (Conflict and Closeness) of the Turkish and the English versions. However, item CPRS 4 was a non-significant item for Conflict in the Turkish version that affected the possibility to conduct further analyses.

Although GBCAs are usually well tolerated, severe and life-threatening allergic reactions might occur, which can result in overly cautions adherence to special precautions in patients. Purpose To evaluate the management of the reported GBCA-associated adverse reactions in subsequent contrast-enhanced MRIs in pediatric patients, distinguishing non-allergic and allergic reactions. Materials and methods In this retrospective, cross-sectional study, consecutive pediatric neurooncological patients who underwent GBCA-enhanced MRI at our university hospital, between 2007 and 2016, were eligible. The patients’ history was evaluated with regard to any adverse events after GBCA administration. In a subset of patients with reported adverse reactions, the institutional premedication regime or an allergy work-up in clinical practice were performed, using either skin-prick tests or intravenous provocation tests in a double-blind procedure. Results Included were 8156 contrast-enhanced MRI scans in 2109 patients. Nineteen acute adverse events (19/8156; 0.23%) in 17 patients (17/2109; 0.81%) were reported. Despite a premedication regime in 14 patients, three patients (3/14; 21.4%) reported a breakthrough reaction. None of the 12 patients who underwent skin-prick tests or intravenous provocation tests showed allergic reactions. At least one well-tolerated GBCA was identified in almost every tested patient. Conclusion A fast-track allergy work-up can help to distinguish non-allergic and allergic reactions and to identify a well-tolerated GBCA, thus avoiding unnecessary premedication for subsequent GBCA administrations."

We conducted a population-based retrospective study to investigate the incidence of THA after treatment of acetabular, pelvic, and combined acetabular and pelvic fractures with open reduction-internal fixation surgery compared with that in the control group. Design A retrospective population-based cohort study. Setting Data were gathered from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Participants We enrolled 3041 patients with acetabular fractures, 5618 with pelvic fractures, and 733 with combined pelvic and acetabular fractures between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2013, totaling 9392 individuals. The control group comprised 664,349 individuals. Study participants were followed up for the occurrence of THA until death or the end of the study period. Results The THA rates after surgical intervention were 17.82%, 7.28%, and 18.01% in patients with acetabular, pelvic, and combined acetabular and pelvic fractures, respectively. Moreover, they were significantly higher for the acetabular fracture, pelvic fracture, and combined-fracture groups (adjusted hazard ratios [aHRs] = 58.42, 21.68, and 62.04, respectively) than for the control group (p < 0.0001) and significantly higher for the acetabular fracture and combined-fracture groups than for the pelvic fracture group (aHRs = 2.59 and 2.68, respectively; p < 0.0001).

In addition, C-sections operations are performed in ORs that provide the first environment and bacterial exposure to the sterile newborns that are extracted directly from the uterus to the OR air. Considering that at least one third of neonates in the US are born via C-section delivery (and more than 50% of all deliveries in some countries), understanding the distribution of bacterial diversity in ORs is critical to better understanding the contribution of the OR microbiota to C-section- associated inflammatory diseases. Here, we mapped the bacteria contained in an OR after a procedure was performed; we sampled grids of 60x60 cm across walls and wall-adjacent floors and sequenced the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene from 260 samples. The results indicate that bacterial communities changed significantly (ANOSIM, p-value < 0.001) with wall height, with an associated reduction of alpha diversity (t-test, p-value <0.05). OR walls contained high proportions of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes being the highest in floors and lowest in the highest wall sites. Members of Firmicutes, Deinococcus-thermus, and Actinobacteria increased with wall height. Source-track analysis estimate that human skin is the major source contributing to bacterial composition in the OR walls, with an increase of bacteria related to human feces in the lowest walls and airborne bacteria in the highest wall sites. The results show that bacterial exposure in ORs varies spatially, and evidence exposure of C-section born neonates to human bacteria that remain on the floors and walls, possibly accumulated from patients, health, and cleaning staff."

The patient-specific representation of the bronchial tree structure is extended beyond the visible airway generation depth using a knowledge-based technique built from morphometric studies. Additional functionalities of AVATREE include visualization of spatial probability maps for the airway generations projected on the CT imaging data, and visualization of the airway tree based on local structure properties. Furthermore, the proposed toolbox supports the simulation of broncho-constriction apparent in pulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. AVATREE is provided as an open-source toolbox in C++ and is supported by a graphical user interface integrating the modelling functionalities. It can be exploited in studies of gas flow, gas mixing, ventilation patterns and particle deposition in the pulmonary system, with the aim to improve clinical decision making."

However, the exact clinical interpretation of these volumetric data has not yet been fully established.We enrolled 42 consecutive patients with MS who fulfilled the revised McDonald criteria of 2010. They were followed-up for more than 3 years from onset, and cross-sectional brain volumetry was performed. Patients with no brain lesions were excluded in advance from this study. For the brain volumetric data, we evaluated several parameters including age-adjusted gray-matter volume atrophy, age-adjusted white-matter volume atrophy, and T2-FLAIR lesion volume. The numbers of T1-hypointense and T2-FLAIR-hyperintense areas were also measured along the same timeline. The clinical data pertaining to disease duration, expanded disability status scale (EDSS), and MS severity score (MSSS) at the timing of volumetry were collected.Among the 42 patients with MS and brain lesions, the number of T1-hypointensity (rho = 0.51, p<0.001), gray-matter atrophy (rho = 0.40, p<0.01) and white-matter atrophy (rho = 0.49, p<0.001) correlated with the EDSS. T1-hypointensity count divided by FLAIR lesion volume correlated with the MSSS (rho = 0.60, p<0.001). Meanwhile, counts or volumes of FLAIR-hyperintense lesions were associated only with the times of past relapses, and did not correlate with present neurological disability level or ongoing disease activity. These findings were consistent regardless of the presence of spinal cord lesions.Numbers of T1-hypointensities and brain atrophy equally indicated the current neurological disability in MS. The number of T1-hypointensities divided by FLAIR lesion volume represented the clinical severity.

This research tested the effect of different historical representations of the African people on Africans' perceptions of African social identity and engagement in identity management strategies across two studies. In Study 1 (N = 162), we tested the effect of two historical representations: positive (prestigious precolonial African history and resistance to the colonial power) and negative (inhumane practices of precolonial Africans). In Study 2 (N = 431), we tested the effect of two historical representations: positive (prestigious precolonial African history) and negative factual (inhuman practices of precolonial Africans) while also making salient the ubiquitous historical representation of the African people (negative colonial-perspective) across all history conditions. We predicted that positive (vs. negative) historical representation would lead to more positive perceptions of African identity, which in turn would predict more collectively-oriented identity management strategies. Altogether, results provided no support for these predictions. We highlight methodological (and by extension theoretical) features-such as, psychological reactance and outgroup audience effect-which may have limited the effect of the manipulations to help inform the interpretation of the null findings obtained. We conclude by discussing other limitations and the theoretical implications of our work, before pointing out various avenues for future research to help us better test, and understand, the role of historical representation in the African context."
https://openalex.org/W3014895523,"The Sm proteins are a conserved protein family with Sm motifs. The family includes Sm and Sm-like proteins, which play important roles in pre-mRNA splicing. Most research on the Sm proteins have been conducted in herbaceous plants, and less in woody plants such as Dimocarpus longan (longan). And the embryo development status significantly affects the quality and yield of longan. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of longan Sm genes (DlSm) to clarify their roles during somatic embryogenesis (SE) and identified 29 Sm genes. Phylogenetic analysis deduced longan Sm proteins clustered into 17 phylogenetic groups with the homologous Sm proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. We also analyzed the gene structures, motif compositions, and conserved domains of the longan Sm proteins. The promoter sequences of the DlSm genes contained many light, endosperm development, hormone, and temperature response elements, which suggested their possible functions. In the non-embryogenic callus(NEC) and during early SE in longan, the alternative splicing(AS) events of DlSm genes indicated that these genes may influence SE development by changing gene structures and sequences. The kinetin(KT) hormone, and blue and white light treatments affected the differentiation and growth of longan embryonic callus(EC) probably by affecting the AS events of DlSm genes. Expression profiles showed the possible functional divergence among Sm genes, and different hormones and light qualities affected their expression levels. The expression trends of the DlSm genes determined by RNA sequencing as fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (FPKM) and by real-time quantitative PCR(qRT-PCR) during early SE in longan showed that the expression of the DlSm genes was affected by the growth and differentiation of longan SE, and decreased as the somatic embryo differentiation progressed. The results will contributed to understanding the longan Sm gene family and provide a basis for future functional validation studies."

https://openalex.org/W3014475022,"Objective This study investigated the medical coping styles of female patients treated with in vitro fertilization and embryonic transfer (IVF-ET), and analyzed the effects of alexithymia and social support on their choice of coping style. Methods A survey was conducted with 285 female patients undergoing IVF-ET in a reproductive medical center of a third-grade class-A hospital in China using the Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire, the Social Support Rating Scale, and the Toronto Alexithymia scale. Results Patients who underwent IVF-ET treatment had a higher score for avoidance as a coping mode than did normal controls. Utilization of social support predicted the use of confrontation as a coping style. Difficulty identifying feelings, objective support, and utilization of social support were factors in the choice of avoidance as a coping style, and length of infertility treatment, difficulty identifying feelings, and subjective support predicted patients’ use of the acceptance-resignation as a coping style. Conclusion Patients who undergo IVF-ET generally select the coping style of avoidance, which is not conducive to treatment. Targeted intervention strategies should be developed based on the factors influencing patients’ choice of coping style(s) to guide them in choosing positive coping methods, improve compliance, and achieve successful pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3015119146,"Background Recent initiatives in psychiatry emphasize the utility of characterizing psychiatric symptoms in a multidimensional manner. However, strategies for applying standard self-report scales for multiaxial assessment have not been well-studied, particularly where the aim is to support both categorical and dimensional phenotypes. Methods We propose a method for applying natural language processing to derive dimensional measures of psychiatric symptoms from questionnaire data. We utilized nine self-report symptom measures drawn from a large cellular biobanking study that enrolled individuals with mood and psychotic disorders, as well as healthy controls. To summarize questionnaire results we used word embeddings, a technique to represent words as numeric vectors preserving semantic and syntactic meaning. A low-dimensional approximation to the embedding space was used to derive the proposed succinct summary of symptom profiles. To validate our embedding-based disease profiles, these were compared to presence or absence of axis I diagnoses derived from structured clinical interview, and to objective neurocognitive testing. Results Unsupervised and supervised classification to distinguish presence/absence of axis I disorders using survey-level embeddings remained discriminative, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve up to 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.74,0.91) using Gaussian mixture modeling, and cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.91, 95% CI (0.88,0.94) using logistic regression. Derived symptom measures and estimated Research Domain Criteria scores also associated significantly with performance on neurocognitive tests. Conclusions Our results support the potential utility of deriving dimensional phenotypic measures in psychiatric illness through the use of word embeddings, while illustrating the challenges in identifying truly orthogonal dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W3014247434,"In a context of high rates of HIV prevalence, concerns over hormonal contraceptive use and the potential for increased risk of HIV acquisition have led to increased attention to counseling messages, particularly for users of the injectable. However, the consequence of adding additional HIV risk messages to family planning counseling sessions was not well understood. This evaluation assessed the effect of providing revised injectable and HIV risk counseling messages on contraceptive knowledge and behavior during a three month pilot intervention. The pilot intervention was conducted September-November 2018 with all eligible family planning clients in ten healthcare facilities located in the Iringa and Njombe regions of Tanzania. Data collection for the evaluation occurred November-December 2018 and included 471 client exit interviews, 26 healthcare provider interviews, and the extraction of service statistics for 12 months prior to the intervention and three months of the intervention. Univariate and bivariate analyses were used to assess quantitative interview data. Thematic qualitative assessment was used to assess qualitative interview data from healthcare providers. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess changes in the trend of contraceptive uptake. Results indicate that the counseling messages did not cause a decrease in the uptake of injectables (Depo-Provera): 97 percent of interviewed clients received Depo-Provera at their visit; sixty percent reported an intention to use condoms for dual protection. The analysis of service statistics showed no statistical difference in the trend of Depo-Provera uptake between the pre-intervention and intervention periods (p = 0.116). Overall knowledge of counseling messages by clients was good; however only 64.8% of women correctly responded that women at risk of getting HIV can use any method of family planning. Providers’ knowledge of the messages was high, though it appears that not all messages were consistently provided during the counseling sessions. The findings from this evaluation provide evidence that complex HIV counseling messages can be implemented in family planning programs in Tanzania, and potentially in other countries that are considering how to better integrate HIV risk messages into family planning counseling."
https://openalex.org/W3014343704,"This paper studies the inverse kinematics of two non-spherical wrist configurations of painting robot. The simplest analytical solution of orthogonal wrist configuration is deduced in this paper for the first time. For the oblique wrist configuration, there is no analytical solution for the configuration. So it is necessary to solve by general method, which cannot achieve high precision and high speed as analytic solution. Two general methods are optimized in this paper. Firstly, the elimination method is optimized to reduce the solving speed to 20% of the original one, and the completeness of the method is supplemented. Based on the Gauss damped least squares method, a new optimization method is proposed to improve the solving speed. The enhanced step length coefficient is introduced to conduct studies with the machine learning correlation method. It has been proved that, on the basis of ensuring the stability of motion, the number of iterations can be effectively reduced and the average number of iterations can be less than 5 times, which can effectively improve the speed of solution. In the simulation and experimental environment, it is verified."

https://openalex.org/W3014256220,"The earliest human blood transfusion is thought to have occurred in the late 18th century. Thus, the therapeutic use of cells is certainly not a new idea! However, interest and progress in this area have grown in the past several years, driven in large part by the successes seen in cancer therapy. Some of the most significant recent advances have been in the development and use of adoptive cell therapies (ACTs). While there are different flavors of ACT, the majority of them involve the isolation and re-infusion of patient cells after being engineered and/or expanded ex vivo. Some of the earliest progress in this area was seen with the use of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), in which patient TILs, including tumor-reactive T cells, are massively expanded ex vivo before being infused back into the patient (Rosenberg et al., 1988Rosenberg S.A. Packard B.S. Aebersold P.M. Solomon D. Topalian S.L. Toy S.T. Simon P. Lotze M.T. Yang J.C. Seipp C.A. et al.Use of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interleukin-2 in the immunotherapy of patients with metastatic melanoma. A preliminary report.N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar, Rosenberg et al., 1994Rosenberg S.A. Yannelli J.R. Yang J.C. Topalian S.L. Schwartzentruber D.J. Weber J.S. Parkinson D.R. Seipp C.A. Einhorn J.H. White D.E. Treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma with autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interleukin 2.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Dramatic and durable responses were seen in patients with treatment-refractory, metastatic melanoma, highlighting the potential of the immune system in treating cancer. However, this approach suffered from several limitations that restricted its application to other cancers, including but not limited to the presence of TILs and the relative abundance of functional, tumor-reactive T cells within them (Rosenberg and Restifo, 2015Rosenberg S.A. Restifo N.P. Adoptive cell transfer as personalized immunotherapy for human cancer.Science. 2015; 348: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). More recently, our genetic engineering toolbox has grown and, with it, the ability to modify patient T cells to overcome some of these limitations. These technologies have allowed us to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) in peripheral T cells and to clone tumor-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs) from the TILs of responding patients. The clinical results have been impressive, and the use of autologous T cells engineered to express a CD19-specific CAR has been approved for the treatment of refractory B cell malignancies (June et al., 2018June C.H. O’Connor R.S. Kawalekar O.U. Ghassemi S. Milone M.C. CAR T cell immunotherapy for human cancer.Science. 2018; 359: 1361-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). While the use of these engineered cells has been highly effective in the treatment of some cancers, there have again been many challenges associated with their use. Efforts to address these are ongoing, highlighted in a separate Perspective in this issue (Weber et al., 2020Weber E.W. Maus M.V. Mackall C.L. The Emerging Landscape of T Cell Therapies.Cell. 2020; 180 (this issue): 46-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here, I focus on recent progress in the therapeutic use of CRISPR-Cas9 to overcome some of these issues and, specifically, on some early clinical trial data that look at the feasibility and safety of CRISPR-Cas9 cell therapies in HIV and cancer. The therapeutic use of CRISPR-Cas9 to remove or correct problematic genes has been posited for years. There are currently many active clinical trials that are testing the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for treatment of a variety of conditions, including cancer, HIV, and genetic disorders such as β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. While most are ongoing, some early results have now been published. One such study involved the transplantation of CRISPR-edited CCR5-deleted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) into a patient with HIV-1 infection (Xu et al., 2019Xu L. Wang J. Liu Y. Xie L. Su B. Mou D. Wang L. Liu T. Wang X. Zhang B. et al.CRISPR-Edited Stem Cells in a Patient with HIV and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia.N Engl J Med. 2019; 381: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Another involved the transfer of autologous NY-ESO1-specific engineered T cells into three patients with refractory, advanced melanoma or sarcoma after CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of the TRAC (TCRα), TRBC (TCRβ), and PDCD1 (PD-1) loci (Stadtmauer et al., 2020Stadtmauer E. Fraietta J. Davis M. Cohen A. Weber K. Lancaster E. Mangan P. Kulikovskaya I. Gupta M. Chen F. et al.CRISPR-engineered T cells in patients with refractory cancer.Science. 2020; 367: eaba7365Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In both studies, the authors showed that edited cells were successfully transplanted and that they could achieve long-term, durable engraftment. However, Xu et al. found that only 5% of the transferred cells were edited at the CCR5 loci, and while Stadtmauer et al. showed edits at all six genomic loci, they also found that the majority of the cells did not contain edits in all of the loci. No clinical benefit was observed in either of these studies. The number of patients treated in these studies was too low to make any meaningful conclusions around safety or therapeutic efficacy. However, these results do address a long-standing question around whether CRISPR-Cas9 edited cells would be tolerated in humans. Xu et al. showed that the modified cells could persist for more than 19 months without gene-editing-related adverse events, while Stadtmauer et al. found that modified T cells could persist for up to 9 months. So, in both cases, immunogenicity was minimal, and rejection of infused cells because of preexisting immunity to Cas9 does not appear to be a major barrier to the clinical application of this technology. While these early results are promising, experience with more patients, higher editing efficiencies, and longer-term follow-up will be important to truly understand the safety and efficacy of these approaches. However, these results go a long way in demonstrating the feasibility of CRISPR-mediated editing of the human genome at the clinical scale. It will be exciting to see the results from ongoing clinical trials in the coming months and years and to see how these technologies and therapies are going to change clinical practice for the benefit of all."
