https://openalex.org/W1965369483,"For more than two decades, asteroid 4 Vesta has been debated as the source for the eucrite, diogenite, and howardite classes of basaltic achondrite meteorites. Its basaltic achondrite spectral properties are unlike those of other large main-belt asteroids. Telescopic measurements have revealed 20 small (diameters </= 10 kilometers) main-belt asteroids that have distinctive optical reflectance spectral features similar to those of Vesta and eucrite and diogenite meteorites. Twelve have orbits that are similar to Vesta's and were previously predicted to be dynamically associated with Vesta. Eight bridge the orbital space between Vesta and the 3:1 resonance, a proposed source region for meteorites. These asteroids are most probably multikilometer-sized fragments excavated from Vesta through one or more impacts. The sizes, ejection velocities of 500 meters per second, and proximity of these fragments to the 3:1 resonance establish Vesta as a dynamically viable source for eucrite, diogenite, and howardite meteorites."

An efficient battery is the key technological element to the development of practical electric vehicles. The science and technology of a nickel metal hydride battery, which stores hydrogen in the solid hydride phase and has high energy density, high power, long life, tolerance to abuse, a wide range of operating temperature, quick-charge capability, and totally sealed maintenance-free operation, is described. A broad range of multi-element metal hydride materials that use structural and compositional disorder on several scales of length has been engineered for use as the negative electrode in this battery. The battery operates at ambient temperature, is made of nontoxic materials, and is recyclable. Demonstration of the manufacturing technology has been achieved."
https://openalex.org/W1965804908,"Frequency-dependent natural selection has been cited as a mechanism for maintaining polymorphisms in biological populations, although the process has not been documented conclusively in field study. Here, it is demonstrated that the direction of mouth-opening (either left-handed or right-handed) in scale-eating cichlid fish of Lake Tanganyika is determined on the basis of simple genetics and that the abundance of individuals with left- or right-handedness depends on frequency-dependent natural selection. Attacking from behind, right-handed individuals snatched scales from the prey's left flank and left-handed ones from the right flank. Within a given population, the frequency of the two phenotypes oscillated around unity. This phenomenon was effected through frequency-dependent selection exerted by the prey's alertness. Thus, individuals of the rare phenotype had more success as predators than those of the more common phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2107224425,"The Landers earthquake, which had a moment magnitude (M(w)) of 7.3, was the largest earthquake to strike the contiguous United States in 40 years. This earthquake resulted from the rupture of five major and many minor right-lateral faults near the southern end of the eastern California shear zone, just north of the San Andreas fault. Its M(w) 6.1 preshock and M(w) 6.2 aftershock had their own aftershocks and foreshocks. Surficial geological observations are consistent with local and far-field seismologic observations of the earthquake. Large surficial offsets (as great as 6 meters) and a relatively short rupture length (85 kilometers) are consistent with seismological calculations of a high stress drop (200 bars), which is in turn consistent with an apparently long recurrence interval for these faults."
https://openalex.org/W2060012941,"Time-series sediment traps were deployed for an entire year at three depths (890, 2590, and 3560 meters) at a deepwater station (3860 meters) in the Panama Basin. The amount of horizontal and lithogenic particulate material arriving at the three depths was seasonally pulsed and directly reflected changes in surface primary production. Two spikes of organic flux were simultaneously recorded at all three depths: (i) a period of high productivity during regional upwelling in February through March and (ii) an unusual bloom of a single species of coccolithophorid during June through July. This latter spike delivered approximately 25 grams of coccolith per square meter of area at a depth of 3860 meters during less than 60 days. The flux of lithogenic particles increased with increasing depth and was seasonally correlated to surface production and current direction, and not to the detritus discharged in river flow. The data suggest that suspended clays are efficiently scavenged from the water column by rapidly sinking organic aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2019502511,"Seismic reflection profiles across many continental margins have imaged bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) parallel to the seabed; these are often interpreted as the base of a zone in which methane hydrate ""ice"" is stable. Waveform inversion of seismic reflection data can be used to estimate from seismic data worldwide the velocity structure of a BSR and its thickness. A test of this method at a drill site of the Ocean Drilling Program predicts that sediment pores beneath the BSR contain free methane for approximately 30 meters. The hydrate and underlying gas represent a large global reservoir of methane, which may have economic importance and may influence global climate."
https://openalex.org/W2044615495,"Ion dynamics computer simulation methods show that for many liquid silicates, like silica itself, the component diffusion coefficients show anomalous pressure dependences. This implies that their viscosities have negative pressure dependences. Overall, there is an interesting degree of analogy between the fundamental binary solutions of geochemistry and the aqueous solutions of common experience; however, due to the stronger bonding in silicate systems, the anomalies are much more persistent. Diffusivity maxima occur at pressures of 200 to 300 kilobars and are correlated with a prevalence of fivefold coordination of silicon ions. The relevance of these findings to planetary dynamics and thermophysical modeling problems is briefly considered."
https://openalex.org/W2051792052,"Analytical models are used to compare the rates at which an isolated fracture and vertical, parallel fracture sets in hydrothermal upflow zones can be closed by silica precipitation and thermoelastic stress. Thermoelastic sealing is an order of magnitude faster than sealing by silica precipitation. In vertical fracture sets, both the amount of silica precipitation resulting from cooling and the total thermal expansion of the country rock may be insufficient to seal cracks at depth. These crack systems may ultimately close because the pressure dependence of silica solubility maintains precipitation during upflow even after the temperature gradient vanishes."
https://openalex.org/W1979889134,"Testes of last-instar larvae of the tobacco budworm release five times more ecdysteroid into incubation medium (judged by radioimmunoassay) in 2.5 hours than is found in testis homogenates. Incubation of testicular components indicates that the testis sheath may be the site of ecdysteroid synthesis. Fractionation of hemolymph, testis homogenate, and incubation medium by high-performance liquid chromatography produces a distinct ecdysteroid pattern in each case. Thus, released testis ecdysteroids are probably converted to other forms for use, sequestration, or general circulation. Their functions are unknown."

Mass spectroscopy of raw soot samples generated in both an alternating and direct current arc between two metal-graphite powder composite electrodes establishes that the titanium and vanadium analogs of the metallo-carbohedrenes have been produced. An estimated yield of approximately 1 percent is obtained, and significantly, the products are stable in air."
https://openalex.org/W2054085008,"A central question in the study of amorphous materials is the extent to which they are ordered. When the crystalline intermetallic R-Al(5)Li(3)Cu is compressed to 23.2 gigapascals at ambient temperature, an amorphous phase is produced whose order can be described as defects in a curved-space crystal. This result supports a structural relation between quasi-crystals and amorphous metals based on icosahedral ordering. This result also shows that a metallic crystal can be made amorphous by compression."
https://openalex.org/W1964957553,"Precision isothermal solution calorimetry was used to determine the standard-state enthalpy of formation of a number of phases in the Y-Ba-Cu-O system. An analysis of the data indicates that YBa(2)Cu(4)O(8) is thermodynamically metastable under ambient conditions. Taken together with the results from previous investigations, these data show that all of the superconducting compounds in the Y-Ba-Cu-O system are thermodynamically metastable at low temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W2080923764,"When Clinton makes his formal budget request this week, he will ask Congress for a 7.2% rise (to $4.75 billion) in DOE's general science and energy supply research programs. Reflecting Clinton's - or perhaps Vice President Al Gore's - green streak, the big winners are solar and other renewable energy sources (up 27% to $327 million) and biological and environmental research (up 17% to $416 million). Losers include some accounts that were expected to suffer - such as nuclear energy research, whose $345 million 1993 budget is to be cut almost in half - as well as some that were not, including basic energy sciences, which would drop 7% from its $861 million 1993 budget. This means that the defense labs will shrink, a blow only somewhat softened by a 68% ($624 million) increase in lab technology transfer programs. In basic research, most of what appears to be a healthy increase is eaten up by new construction, leaving core science programs with little more than a cost-of-living rise of about 3%. Clinton's 1994 request will include $20 million to start work on the Tokamak Physics Experiment at Princeton, $26 million to kick off an Advanced Neutron Source at Oak Ridgemore » National Laboratory, and $36 million to establish a B-factory - an accelerator to produce a high-intensity beam of particles known as B mesons - at either the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) or Cornell University.« less"

At the March American Physical Society meeting in Seattle, some of the 4500 physicists probed the hazards of the micro world, where weird quantum effects can scramble information. Others outlined its opportunities: Molecular engineering that is leading to new information storage materials, and minute structures that could form tethers and containers in some future nanotechnology."
