https://openalex.org/W3155470693,"How do attitudes toward vaccination change over the course of a public health crisis? We report results from a longitudinal survey of United States residents during six months (March 16 –August 16, 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to past research suggesting that the increased salience of a disease threat should improve attitudes toward vaccines, we observed a decrease in intentions of getting a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available. We further found a decline in general vaccine attitudes and intentions of getting the influenza vaccine. Analyses of heterogeneity indicated that this decline is driven by participants who identify as Republicans, who showed a negative trend in vaccine attitudes and intentions, whereas Democrats remained largely stable. Consistent with research on risk perception and behavior, those with less favorable attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccination also perceived the virus to be less threatening. We provide suggestive evidence that differential exposure to media channels and social networks could explain the observed asymmetric polarization between self-identified Democrats and Republicans."

Such pressures may impact on working conditions, psychological wellbeing and perception of safety. In spite of this, no study has assessed the relationship between safety attitudes and psychological outcomes. Moreover, only limited studies have examined the relationship between personal characteristics and psychological outcomes during Covid-19. From 22nd March 2020 to 18th June 2020, healthcare workers from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore were invited to participate using a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate safety culture, burnout and anxiety/depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of burnout, anxiety and depression. Of 3,537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 2,364 (67%) screened positive for burnout, 701 (20%) for anxiety, and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of burnout included patient-facing roles: doctor (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.49–2.95), nurse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04–1.84), and ‘other clinical’ (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.45–2.82); being redeployed (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02–1.58), bottom quartile SAQ score (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.98–2.99), anxiety (OR 4.87; 95% CI 3.92–6.06) and depression (OR 4.06; 95% CI 3.04–5.42). Significant factors inversely correlated with burnout included being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51–0.82) and top quartile SAQ score (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.22–0.40). Significant factors associated with anxiety and depression, included burnout, gender, safety attitudes and job role. Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of burnout, anxiety, and depression amongst healthcare workers. A strong association was seen between SARS-CoV-2 testing, safety attitudes, gender, job role, redeployment and psychological state. These findings highlight the importance of targeted support services for at risk groups and proactive SARS-CoV-2 testing of healthcare workers."

Some contaminants could have value if recovered, but these are often discharged in the waste streams. Uliana et al. describe a general approach for the fabrication of robust, tunable, adsorptive membranes through the incorporation of porous aromatic framework (PAF) nanoparticles into ion exchange membranes such as those made from sulfonated polymers. Salts are removed using a series of cation and anion exchange membranes, and the PAF particles can be selected to capture specific target ions, such as those of copper, mercury, or iron. This allows for simultaneous desalination and decontamination of the water. Science , this issue p. 296"
https://openalex.org/W3155495511,"Carbon cycling after boreal forest fire Wildfire activity has been increasing in the boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere, releasing carbon into the atmosphere from biomass and soil, with potential feedback to climate warming. In a long-term study, Mack et al. analyzed wildfire impacts on the carbon balance of boreal forest in Alaska, with particular focus on forest-regeneration patterns. After fire, the species composition in most of the study sites changed from black spruce to a mixture of conifers and deciduous broadleaf tree species. The stands that had shifted to deciduous dominance stored fivefold more soil carbon than stands that returned to black spruce dominance. Therefore, the functional traits of deciduous trees compensated for the combustion loss of soil carbon, pointing to a potential mitigation of the feedback effect of boreal forest fire to climate warming.

https://openalex.org/W3155528889,"A central question in the post-genomic era is how genes interact to form biological pathways. Measurements of gene dependency across hundreds of cell lines have been used to cluster genes into 'co-essential' pathways, but this approach has been limited by ubiquitous false positives. In the present study, we develop a statistical method that enables robust identification of gene co-essentiality and yields a genome-wide set of functional modules. This atlas recapitulates diverse pathways and protein complexes, and predicts the functions of 108 uncharacterized genes. Validating top predictions, we show that TMEM189 encodes plasmanylethanolamine desaturase, a key enzyme for plasmalogen synthesis. We also show that C15orf57 encodes a protein that binds the AP2 complex, localizes to clathrin-coated pits and enables efficient transferrin uptake. Finally, we provide an interactive webtool for the community to explore our results, which establish co-essentiality profiling as a powerful resource for biological pathway identification and discovery of new gene functions."

Ustick et al. used the prevalence of Prochlorococcus genes involved in nutrient acquisition to develop maps of inferred nutrient stress across the global ocean (see the Perspective by Coleman). They found broad patterns of limitation consistent with an Earth system model and nutrient addition experiments. Leveraging metagenomic data in this manner is an appealing approach that will help to expand our understanding of the biogeochemistry in the vast open ocean.

https://openalex.org/W3152771199,"Apart from well-defined factors in neuronal cells1, only a few reports consider that the variability of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression can depend on less-defined contributions from glia2,3 and blood vessels4. In this study we use an expression-weighted cell-type enrichment method to infer cell activity in spinal cord samples from patients with sporadic ALS and mouse models of this disease. Here we report that patients with sporadic ALS present cell activity patterns consistent with two mouse models in which enrichments of vascular cell genes preceded microglial response. Notably, during the presymptomatic stage, perivascular fibroblast cells showed the strongest gene enrichments, and their marker proteins SPP1 and COL6A1 accumulated in enlarged perivascular spaces in patients with sporadic ALS. Moreover, in plasma of 574 patients with ALS from four independent cohorts, increased levels of SPP1 at disease diagnosis repeatedly predicted shorter survival with stronger effect than the established risk factors of bulbar onset or neurofilament levels in cerebrospinal fluid. We propose that the activity of the recently discovered perivascular fibroblast can predict survival of patients with ALS and provide a new conceptual framework to re-evaluate definitions of ALS etiology."

https://openalex.org/W3153491424,"Current next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) methods do not provide accurate quantification of small RNAs within a sample, due to sequence-dependent biases in capture, ligation and amplification during library preparation. We present a method, absolute quantification RNA-sequencing (AQRNA-seq), that minimizes biases and provides a direct, linear correlation between sequencing read count and copy number for all small RNAs in a sample. Library preparation and data processing were optimized and validated using a 963-member microRNA reference library, oligonucleotide standards of varying length, and RNA blots. Application of AQRNA-seq to a panel of human cancer cells revealed >800 detectable miRNAs that varied during cancer progression, while application to bacterial transfer RNA pools, with the challenges of secondary structure and abundant modifications, revealed 80-fold variation in tRNA isoacceptor levels, stress-induced site-specific tRNA fragmentation, quantitative modification maps, and evidence for stress-induced, tRNA-driven, codon-biased translation. AQRNA-seq thus provides a versatile means to quantitatively map the small RNA landscape in cells. AQRNA-seq allows accurate quantification of small RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W3153563840,"Geometrical frustration, quantum entanglement and disorder may prevent long-range order of localized spins with strong exchange interactions, resulting in a novel state of matter. $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$-Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ is considered the best approximation of this elusive quantum-spin-liquid state, but its ground-state properties remain puzzling. Here we present a multi-frequency electron-spin resonance study down to millikelvin temperatures, revealing a rapid drop of the spin susceptibility at $T^*=6\,\mathrm{K}$. This opening of a spin gap, accompanied by structural modifications, suggests the enigmatic `$6\,\mathrm{K}$-anomaly' as the transition to a valence-bond-solid ground state. We identify an impurity contribution that becomes dominant when the intrinsic spins form singlets. Only probing the electrons directly manifests the pivotal role of defects for the low-energy properties of quantum-spin systems without magnetic order."
https://openalex.org/W3155300688,"Known fetal hemoglobin (HbF) silencers have potential on-target liabilities for rational β-hemoglobinopathy therapeutic inhibition. Here, through transcription factor (TF) CRISPR screening, we identify zinc-finger protein (ZNF) 410 as an HbF repressor. ZNF410 does not bind directly to the genes encoding γ-globins, but rather its chromatin occupancy is concentrated solely at CHD4, encoding the NuRD nucleosome remodeler, which is itself required for HbF repression. CHD4 has two ZNF410-bound regulatory elements with 27 combined ZNF410 binding motifs constituting unparalleled genomic clusters. These elements completely account for the effects of ZNF410 on fetal globin repression. Knockout of ZNF410 or its mouse homolog Zfp410 reduces CHD4 levels by 60%, enough to substantially de-repress HbF while eluding cellular or organismal toxicity. These studies suggest a potential target for HbF induction for β-hemoglobin disorders with a wide therapeutic index. More broadly, ZNF410 represents a special class of gene regulator, a conserved TF with singular devotion to regulation of a chromatin subcomplex. A CRISPR screen combined with in vivo data identify ZNF410 as an indirect repressor of fetal hemoglobin. ZNF410 binds to and regulates CHD4 expression, which in turn silences fetal hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W3154539974,"Circuit design for control of metabolism A transcriptional control mechanism in yeast that allows cells to respond to changes in nutrient concentrations works very much like a household light-dimmer switch. That is, the system separately controls whether gene expression is “on” or “off” and the extent of gene expression. The galactose-responsive pathway is activated when yeast need to switch from metabolizing glucose to metabolizing galactose. Ricci-Tam et al. found that, rather than using two separate elements for the switch and dimmer controls, yeast use a single transcription factor, Gal4p, separately regulating its abundance (through transcriptional regulation) and its catalytic activity (through interaction with a protein-binding partner). Such regulation may be common and can allow responses to the environment on physiological and evolutionary time scales. Science , this issue p. 292"
https://openalex.org/W3156053968,"Recent methods for spatial imaging of tissue samples can identify up to ~100 individual proteins1-3 or RNAs4-10 at single-cell resolution. However, the number of proteins or genes that can be studied in these approaches is limited by long imaging times. Here we introduce Composite In Situ Imaging (CISI), a method that leverages structure in gene expression across both cells and tissues to limit the number of imaging cycles needed to obtain spatially resolved gene expression maps. CISI defines gene modules that can be detected using composite measurements from imaging probes for subsets of genes. The data are then decompressed to recover expression values for individual genes. CISI further reduces imaging time by not relying on spot-level resolution, enabling lower magnification acquisition, and is overall about 500-fold more efficient than current methods. Applying CISI to 12 mouse brain sections, we accurately recovered the spatial abundance of 37 individual genes from 11 composite measurements covering 180 mm2 and 476,276 cells."
https://openalex.org/W3152910468,"Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes COVID-19, which has become a worldwide pandemic. However, until now, there is no vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat COVID-19. Objectives To find out the effective treatment as an antiviral agent for COVID-19, to determine the correlation between sociodemography with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment, and to determine the relationship between comorbidities with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in this study. This study included only confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the hospital during April-May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to select 103 patients, but only 72 patients were suitable for inclusion. Results The survival analysis for COVID-19 patients using the Kaplan Meier method showed that patients receiving Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine had an average survival rate of about 83% after undergoing treatment of about ten days. Gender (p = 0.450) and age (p = 0.226) did not have a significant correlation with the duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Gender (p = 0.174) and age (p = 0.065) also did not have a significant correlation with clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. Comorbidities showed a significant correlation with duration of treatment (p = 0.002) and clinical outcome (p = 0.014) of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion The most effective antiviral agent in this study based on treatment duration was the combination of Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine. The higher the patient’s average treatment duration is, the lower the average survival rate for COVID-19 patients."

Having identified traditional and religious leaders (TRLs) as potential public health change agents, this study aimed at assessing the effect of training them to support routine immunisation for the purpose of improving uptake of childhood vaccines in Cross River State, Nigeria. Methods A cluster-randomised controlled study was conducted between 2016 and 2019. Of the 18 Local Government Areas (LGA) in Cross River State, eight (four urban and four rural LGAs) were randomized into the intervention and control study arms. A multi-component intervention involving the training of traditional and religious leaders was implemented in the four intervention LGAs. Baseline, midline and endline surveys collected information on children aged 0–23 months. The effect of the intervention on outcomes including the proportion fully up-to-date with vaccination, timely vaccination for pentavalent and measles vaccines, and pentavalent 1–3 dropout rates were estimated using logistic regression models using random effects to account for the clustered data. Results A total of 2598 children at baseline, 2570 at midline, and 2550 at endline were included. The intervention was effective in increasing the proportion with at least one vaccine (OR 12.13 95% CI 6.03–24.41p&lt;0.001). However, there was no evidence of an impact on the proportion of children up-to-date with vaccination (p = 0.69). It was effective in improving timeliness of Pentavalent 3 (OR 1.55; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.12; p = 0.005) and Measles (OR 2.81; 96% CI: 1.93–4.1; p&lt;0.001) vaccination. The odds of completing Pentavalent vaccination increased (OR = 1.66 95% CI: 1.08,2.55). Conclusion Informal training to enhance the traditional and religious leaders’ knowledge of vaccination and their leadership role can empower them to be good influencers for childhood vaccination.

https://openalex.org/W3155733323,"Gene expression profiles can be utilized in the diagnosis of critical diseases such as cancer. The selection of biomarker genes from these profiles is significant and crucial for cancer detection. This paper presents a framework proposing a two-stage multifilter hybrid model of feature selection for colon cancer classification. Colon cancer is being extremely common nowadays among other types of cancer. There is a need to find fast and an accurate method to detect the tissues, and enhance the diagnostic process and the drug discovery. This paper reports on a study whose objective has been to improve the diagnosis of cancer of the colon through a two-stage, multifilter model of feature selection. The model described deals with feature selection using a combination of Information Gain and a Genetic Algorithm. The next stage is to filter and rank the genes identified through this method using the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) technique. The final phase is to further analyze the data using correlated machine learning algorithms. This two-stage approach, which involves the selection of genes before classification techniques are used, improves success rates for the identification of cancer cells. It is found that Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naïve Bayes classifiers had showed promising accurate results using the developed hybrid framework model. It is concluded that the performance of our proposed method has achieved a higher accuracy in comparison with the existing methods reported in the literatures. This study can be used as a clue to enhance treatment and drug discovery for the colon cancer cure."
https://openalex.org/W3156201544,"Objective To assess whether machine learning algorithms (MLA) can predict eyes that will undergo rapid glaucoma progression based on an initial visual field (VF) test. Design Retrospective analysis of longitudinal data. Subjects 175,786 VFs (22,925 initial VFs) from 14,217 patients who completed ≥5 reliable VFs at academic glaucoma centers were included. Methods Summary measures and reliability metrics from the initial VF and age were used to train MLA designed to predict the likelihood of rapid progression. Additionally, the neural network model was trained with point-wise threshold data in addition to summary measures, reliability metrics and age. 80% of eyes were used for a training set and 20% were used as a test set. MLA test set performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Performance of models trained on initial VF data alone was compared to performance of models trained on data from the first two VFs. Main outcome measures Accuracy in predicting future rapid progression defined as MD worsening more than 1 dB/year. Results 1,968 eyes (8.6%) underwent rapid progression. The support vector machine model (AUC 0.72 [95% CI 0.70–0.75]) most accurately predicted rapid progression when trained on initial VF data. Artificial neural network, random forest, logistic regression and naïve Bayes classifiers produced AUC of 0.72, 0.70, 0.69, 0.68 respectively. Models trained on data from the first two VFs performed no better than top models trained on the initial VF alone. Based on the odds ratio (OR) from logistic regression and variable importance plots from the random forest model, older age (OR: 1.41 per 10 year increment [95% CI: 1.34 to 1.08]) and higher pattern standard deviation (OR: 1.31 per 5-dB increment [95% CI: 1.18 to 1.46]) were the variables in the initial VF most strongly associated with rapid progression. Conclusions MLA can be used to predict eyes at risk for rapid progression with modest accuracy based on an initial VF test. Incorporating additional clinical data to the current model may offer opportunities to predict patients most likely to rapidly progress with even greater accuracy."

Extracellular proteolysis of CDCP1 by poorly defined mechanisms induces pro-metastatic signaling. We describe a new approach for the rapid identification of proteases responsible for key proteolytic events using a substrate-biased activity-based probe (sbABP) that incorporates a substrate cleavage motif grafted onto a peptidyl diphenyl phosphonate warhead for specific target protease capture, isolation and identification. Using a CDCP1-biased probe, we identify urokinase (uPA) as the master regulator of CDCP1 proteolysis, which acts both by directly cleaving CDCP1 and by activating CDCP1-cleaving plasmin. We show that coexpression of uPA and CDCP1 is strongly predictive of poor disease outcome across multiple cancers and demonstrate that uPA-mediated CDCP1 proteolysis promotes metastasis in disease-relevant preclinical in vivo models. These results highlight CDCP1 cleavage as a potential target to disrupt cancer and establish sbABP technology as a new approach to identify disease-relevant proteases. A substrate-biased activity-based probe technology was developed to enable relatively facile identification of proteases responsible for specific proteolytic events in complex biological milieu, revealing that urokinase regulates CDCP1 proteolysis."

Our method generates of diverse mixtures of thousands of recombinant antibodies, enriched for specificity and activity against therapeutic targets. Each hyperimmune globulin product comprised thousands to tens of thousands of antibodies derived from convalescent or vaccinated human donors or from immunized mice. Using this approach, we generated hyperimmune globulins with potent neutralizing activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in under 3 months, Fc-engineered hyperimmune globulins specific for Zika virus that lacked antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, and hyperimmune globulins specific for lung pathogens present in patients with primary immune deficiency.

Knowledge of the factors affecting the quantitative and qualitative properties of the compounds in its essential oil (EO) and the bioactivity of this EO is important in optimizing Damask rose cultivation and production. This research studied, for the first time, the effects of irrigation water and soil chemical and physical characteristics on the EO yield of this important commercial species and on it chemical composition and antimicrobial activity. The results showed the significant effect of crop cultivation site on yield, chemical composition and inhibition zone diameter (IZD) at the 1% significance level. The highest EO yield (~0.0266%), which belonged to the Noushabad site (EO N ), resulted from the increased soil electrical conductivity (EC) and the higher sand, gypsum and lime contents and irrigation water salinity. Analysis of the chemical composition of the EOs showed that their main compounds at all three crop sites were citronellol, nonadecane, heneicosane and geraniol. The EO obtained from the Yazdel site (EO Y ) had the highest contents of citronellol and geraniol (~29.05% and ~6.85%) that were directly correlated with soil potassium and phosphorus contents and inversely correlated with soil acidity and EC and its lime, nitrogen, and organic carbon contents. Antimicrobial assays indicated that the EO extracted from the Sefidshahr site (EO S ), which had the largest inhibition zone diameter (~14.67 mm) for Aspergillus brasiliensis (IZD~14.67 mm) and the lowest MIC (~31.25 μg/mL) for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , exhibited efficacy similar to that of rifampin, probably due to the dominance of the alkanes in it. The EO Y and EO S also exhibited the strongest inhibitory and lethal activity against Candida albicans (MIC and MBC &lt;15.63 μg/mL for EO Y and MIC and MBC = 62.5 μg/mL for EO S ), which were six and four times stronger than those of nystatin, respectively. Therefore, the selected EOs can act as a potentially promising strategy for fighting microbial strains."

In order to tackle the devastating condition of the virus, countries need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics. Thus, to strengthen the COVID-19 mitigation measures and to give rapid response, there is an urgent need to understand the public’s knowledge and attitude about of the pandemic at this critical moment. Objective This study was aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of communities about COVID-19 and associated factors among Gondar City residents. Methods A community based cross-sectional study was done among 623 respondents in Gondar city from April 20-27/2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire adapted from different literatures. The data were entered using Epi data version 3.1 and then exported into STATA version 14 for analysis. Bi-variable and multivariable binary logistic regression were performed. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to declare statistically significant variables on the basis of p value less than 0.05 in the multivariable binary logistic regression model. Results The overall knowledge and attitude of the community towards COVID19 was 51.85% [95% CI (47.91%-55.78%)] and 53.13% [95% CI (49.20, 57.06%)], respectively.

https://openalex.org/W3156309512,"Glomerular hypertension induces mechanical load to podocytes, often resulting in podocyte detachment and the development of glomerulosclerosis. Although it is well known that podocytes are mechanosensitive, the mechanosensors and mechanotransducers are still unknown. Since filamin A, an actin-binding protein, is already described to be a mechanosensor and mechanotransducer, we hypothesized that filamins could be important for the outside-in signaling as well as the actin cytoskeleton of podocytes under mechanical stress. In this study, we demonstrate that filamin A is the main isoform of the filamin family that is expressed in cultured podocytes. Together with filamin B, filamin A was significantly up-regulated during mechanical stretch (3 days, 0.5 Hz, and 5% extension). To study the role of filamin A in cultured podocytes under mechanical stress, filamin A was knocked down (Flna KD) by specific siRNA. Additionally, we established a filamin A knockout podocyte cell line (Flna KO) by CRISPR/Cas9. Knockdown and knockout of filamin A influenced the expression of synaptopodin, a podocyte-specific protein, focal adhesions as well as the morphology of the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, the cell motility of Flna KO podocytes was significantly increased. Since the knockout of filamin A has had no effect on cell adhesion of podocytes during mechanical stress, we simultaneously knocked down the expression of filamin A and B. Thereby, we observed a significant loss of podocytes during mechanical stress indicating a compensatory mechanism. Analyzing hypertensive mice kidneys as well as biopsies of patients suffering from diabetic nephropathy, we found an up-regulation of filamin A in podocytes in contrast to the control. In summary, filamin A and B mediate matrix-actin cytoskeleton interactions which are essential for the adaptation of cultured podocyte to mechanical stress."
https://openalex.org/W3154664413,"Environmental challenges to natural resources have been attributed to human behavior and traditional agricultural production techniques. Natural resource degradation in agriculture has always been a prime concern in agro ecological research and sustainability analysis. There are many techniques for assessing environmental performance; one of which, ecological footprint (EF), assesses human pressure on the environment and natural resources. The main purpose of this study was calculation of ecological indices including biocapacity (BC) and EF of rural areas of Fars province of Iran. The study was accomplished using survey and structured interviews consisting of three main questionnaires in two different steps. Different agricultural stakeholders, including farmers (for the first step) as well as the policymakers, extension managers and authorities (for the second step) were interviewed. Based on multi-stage stratified random sampling, 50 villages and 423 farmers were selected. Face validity and reliability of the questionnaires were assessed by a panel of specialists as well as conducting a pilot study, respectively. The paradigmatic perspectives of agricultural policy makers and managers (22 individuals) were also analyzed using another specific questionnaire by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Findings revealed that most of the studied villages faced a critical environmental condition due to the results of ecological indicator which was calculated in the study. According to the four main components of human ecology (POET model) including Population , Organization , Environment and Technology , village groups that differed in terms of sustainability level also showed significantly differences due to population, social participation, use of green technologies and attitude towards diverse environmental management paradigms. The causal model also revealed that population, green technology, social participation and attitude toward frontier economics, which were in accordance with the elements of human ecology model, were the main factors affecting the ecological index. Finally, AHP results determined the dominant economic perspectives of agricultural authorities. A paradigm shift toward the comprehensive paradigm of eco-development plus consideration of the results of the ecological indicator calculation as the base of agricultural planning at the local level were recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3153580926,"This study investigates the microbiological and immunological basis underlying the efficacy of electron beam-inactivated immune modulators. The underlying hypothesis is that exposure to eBeam-based ionization reactions inactivate microorganisms without modifying their antigenic properties and thereby creating immune modulators. The immunological correlates of protection induced by such eBeam based Salmonella Typhimurium (EBST) immune modulators in dendritic cell (DC) ( in vitro ) and mice ( in vivo ) models were assessed. The EBST stimulated innate pro inflammatory response (TNFα) and maturation (MHC-II, CD40, CD80 and CD86) of DC. Immuno-stimulatory potential of EBST was on par with both a commercial Salmonella vaccine, and live Salmonella cells. The EBST cells did not multiply under permissive in vitro and in vivo conditions. However, EBST cells remained metabolically active. EBST immunized mice developed Salmonella -specific CD4+ T-cells that produced the Th1 cytokine IFNγ at a level similar to that induced by the live attenuated vaccine (AroA - ST) formulation. The EBST retained stable immunogenic properties for several months at room temperature, 4°C, and -20°C as well as after lyophilization. Therefore, such eBeam-based immune modulators have potential as vaccine candidates since they offer the safety of a “killed” vaccine, while retaining the immunogenicity of an “attenuated” vaccine. The ability to store eBeam based immune modulators at room temperature without loss of potency is also noteworthy."
https://openalex.org/W3156068399,"Vertical tanks are commonly used appliances for liquids, and its capacity is very important for quantitative liquid ratio and liquid trade. In order to measure the capacity of vertical tanks more conveniently, this paper proposes a vertical tank capacity measurement method based on Monte Carlo Method. The method arranges a plurality of sensor points on the inner surface of the tank, and then performs Monte Carlo tests by generating a large number of random sample points, and finally calculates the capacity by counting the sample points that meet the criterion. The criterion for whether a sample point is located in the tank, which is the core issue, is established with the coordinates of sensor points and the distance between different sensor points along the surface of the tank. The results show that the absolute error of the measurement results of the proposed method does not exceed ±0.0003[m 3 ], and the absolute error of capacity per unit volume has a linear relationship with the height of the vertical tank, and has little effect with the radial size of the vertical tank."
https://openalex.org/W3155200320,"Brazil has a cesarean rate of 56% and low use of Intrapartum Evidence-based Practices (IEBP) of 3.4%, reflecting a medically centered and highly interventionist maternal health care model. The Senses of Birth (SoB) is a health education intervention created to promote normal birth, use of EBP, and reduce unnecessary c-sections. This study aimed to understand the use of intrapartum EBP by Brazilian women who participated in the SoB intervention. 555 women answered the questionnaire between 2015 and 2016. Bivariate analysis and ANOVA test were used to identify if social-demographic factors, childbirth information, and perceived knowledge were associated with the use of EBP. A qualitative analysis was performed to explore women’s experiences. Research participants used the following EBP: birth plan (55.2%), companionship during childbirth (81.6%), midwife care (54.2%), freedom of mobility during labor (57.7%), choice of position during delivery (57.2%), and non-pharmacological pain relief methods (74.2%). Doula support was low (26.9%). Being a black woman was associated with not using a birth plan or having doula support. Women who gave birth in private hospitals were more likely not to use the EBP. Barriers to the use of EBP identified by women were an absence of individualized care, non-respect for their choices or provision of EBP by health care providers, inadequate structure and ambiance in hospitals to use EBP, and rigid protocols not centered on women’s needs. The SoB intervention was identified as a potential facilitator. Women who used EBP described a sense of control over their bodies and perceived self-efficacy to advocate for their chosen practices. Women saw the strategies to overcome barriers as a path to become their childbirth protagonist. Health education is essential to increase the use of EBP; however, it should be implemented combined with changes in the maternal care system, promoting woman-centered and evidence-based models."
https://openalex.org/W3155863056,"Background A large proportion of children are not able to perform age-appropriate fundamental movement skills (FMS). Thus, it is important to assess FMS so that children needing additional support can be identified in a timely fashion. There is great potential for universal screening of FMS in schools, but research has established that current assessment tools are not fit for purpose. Objective To develop and validate the psychometric properties of a FMS assessment tool designed specifically to meet the demands of universal screening in schools. Methods A working group consisting of academics from developmental psychology, public health and behavioural epidemiology developed an assessment tool (FUNMOVES) based on theory and prior evidence. Over three studies, 814 children aged 4 to 11 years were assessed in school using FUNMOVES. Rasch analysis was used to evaluate structural validity and modifications were then made to FUNMOVES activities after each study based on Rasch results and implementation fidelity. Results The initial Rasch analysis found numerous psychometric problems including multidimensionality, disordered thresholds, local dependency, and misfitting items. Study 2 showed a unidimensional measure, with acceptable internal consistency and no local dependency, but that did not fit the Rasch model. Performance on a jumping task was misfitting, and there were issues with disordered thresholds (for jumping, hopping and balance tasks). Study 3 revealed a unidimensional assessment tool with good fit to the Rasch model, and no further issues, once jumping and hopping scoring were modified. Implications The finalised version of FUNMOVES (after three iterations) meets standards for accurate measurement, is free and able to assess a whole class in under an hour using resources available in schools. Thus FUNMOVES has the potential to allow schools to efficiently screen FMS to ensure that targeted support can be provided and disability barriers removed."
https://openalex.org/W3156211341,"Objective The use of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) to evaluate care is being advocated increasingly in clinical settings. Electronic data capture is both resource and environmentally friendly and convenient. This purpose of this study was to test and implement a nationwide system to collect routine PROM data from osteopathic patients using a web and mobile app. Methods A prospective study design was used to monitor outcomes of care for patients attending osteopathic clinics. Demographic and service data were collected, the primary outcomes were the Bournemouth Questionnaire and a Global Rating of Change score. Data concerning patients’ satisfaction and experience of care were collected also. Data were collected at baseline, one week, and six weeks post-treatment. Results A total of 1721 patients completed the PROM app questionnaire. The majority (65.8%) of patients who used the PROM app were between 40 and 69 years old with 11% being 70 years and over. At baseline 39.8% of patients reported they’d had their symptoms for 13 weeks or more. Low back pain was the most common symptom (55.8%). Patients reported high scores for both satisfaction and experience of osteopathic care: 88.1% were very satisfied at six weeks post-baseline and 93.5% reported very good experience at six weeks post-baseline. Data from the Global Rating of Change scale indicated that at one week post-baseline 89.1% of patients reported some measure of improvement, and at six weeks this figure rose to 92.8%. The mean sum score for the Bournemouth Questionnaire went from 30.8 at baseline to 13.3 at six weeks post-baseline. This represented a significant and clinically meaningful positive change score of 56.8%. Conclusion The app was well-completed and the data very encouraging. These data will help to form the basis for standards of care for patients attending osteopathic practices."
https://openalex.org/W3154281604,"Tamoxifen (TAM) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used for breast cancer patients. Prolonged use of tamoxifen is not recommended for some patients. In this study, we aimed to identify molecular targets sensitive to TAM using a genome-wide gene deletion library screening of fission yeast heterozygous mutants. From the screening, casein kinase 1 gamma 2 ( CSNK1G2 ), a serine-/threonine protein kinase, was the most sensitive target to TAM with a significant cytotoxicity in estrogen receptor-positive (ER + ) breast cancer cells but with only a slight toxicity in the case of ER - cells. In addition, tumor sphere formation and expression of breast stem cell marker genes such as CD44 / CD2 were greatly inhibited by CSNK1G2 knockdown in ER + breast cancer cells. Consistently, CSNK1G2 altered ERα activity via phosphorylation, specifically at serine (Ser) 167 , as well as the regulation of estrogen-responsive element (ERE) of estrogen-responsive genes such as CTSD and GREB1 . However, ERα silencing almost completely blocked CSNK1G2 -induced TAM sensitivity. In ER + breast cancer cells, combined treatment with TAM and CSNK1G2 knockdown further enhanced the TAM-mediated decrease in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) signaling but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Inversely, in ER - cells treated with TAM, only ERK and PI3K signaling was altered by CSNK1G2 knockdown. The CK1 inhibitor, D4476, partly mimicked the CSNK1G2 knockdown effect in ER + breast cancer cells, but with a broader repression ranging from PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K to ERK signaling. Collectively, these results suggest that CSNK1G2 plays a key role in sensitizing TAM toxicity in ER + and ER - breast cancer cells via differently regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K and ERK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3154578796,"Wormian (intrasutural) bones are small, irregular bones, that are found in the cranial sutures of the skull. The occurrence of Wormian bones in human skulls has been well documented but few studies have detected the presence of such bones in domestic animals. Although some research has linked the presence of Wormian bones to bone pathology, its anatomical significance in healthy individuals is not known. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has examined the biomechanical features of Wormian bone. This study uses microCT imaging of the parietal bone region to determine the frequency of occurrence of Wormian bones in horse skulls and, through 3-point bending tests, to calculate the mechanical differences that result from the presence of such bones. In addition, bone properties such as bone mineral density (BMD) and stiffness were measured and analysed to determine the influence of Wormian bone. Our findings on 54 specimens taken from 10 horses (ages ranging from 4 to 29 years) showed that Wormian bone was present in 70% of subjects and that its occurrence was unrelated to age or sex. 3-point bend tests revealed that the stiffness normalised by cross section area (P = 0.038) was lower in samples where Wormian bone was present. An idealised Finite Element simulation confirmed that the presence of Wormian bone reduced the maximum stress and strain, as well as their distribution throughout the sample. We consequently conclude that the presence of Wormian bones, which are confined to the calvaria, increase the compliance of the bone and reduce the likelihood of skull fracture. As all skull samples were collected from a local abattoir, ethical approval was not required for this work."
https://openalex.org/W3154765574,"Endometriosis, a common gynecological disease, causes chronic pelvic pain and infertility in women of reproductive age. Due to the limited efficacy of current therapies, a critical need exists to develop new treatments for endometriosis. Inflammatory dysfunction, instigated by abnormal macrophage (MΦ) function, contributes to disease development and progression. However, the fundamental role of the heterogeneous population of peritoneal MΦ and their potential druggable functions is uncertain. Here we report that GATA6-expressing large peritoneal MΦ (LPM) were increased in the peritoneal cavity following lesion induction. This was associated with increased cytokine and chemokine secretion in the peritoneal fluid (PF), as well as MΦ infiltration, vascularization and innervation in endometriosis-like lesions (ELL). Niclosamide, an FDA-approved anti-helminthic drug, was effective in reducing LPM number, but not small peritoneal MΦ (SPM), in the PF. Niclosamide also inhibits aberrant inflammation in the PF, ELL, pelvic organs (uterus and vagina) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG), as well as MΦ infiltration, vascularization and innervation in the ELL. PF from ELL mice stimulated DRG outgrowth in vitro, whereas the PF from niclosamide-treated ELL mice lacked the strong stimulatory nerve growth response. These results suggest LPM induce aberrant inflammation in endometriosis promoting lesion progression and establishment of the inflammatory environment that sensitizes peripheral nociceptors in the lesions and other pelvic organs, leading to increased hyperalgesia. Our findings provide the rationale for targeting LPM and their functions with niclosamide and its efficacy in endometriosis as a new non-hormonal therapy to reduce aberrant inflammation which may ultimately diminish associated pain."
https://openalex.org/W3155642319,"The current limitations in evaluating synovial fluid (SF) components in health and disease and between species are due in part to the lack of data on normal SF, because of low availability of SF from healthy articular joints. Our study aimed to quantify species-dependent differences in phospholipid (PL) profiles of normal knee SF obtained from equine and human donors. Knee SF was obtained during autopsy by arthrocentesis from 15 and 13 joint-healthy human and equine donors, respectively. PL species extracted from SF were quantitated by mass spectrometry whereas ELISA determined apolipoprotein (Apo) B-100. Wilcoxon’s rank sum test with adjustment of scores for tied values was applied followed by Holm´s method to account for multiple testing. Six lipid classes with 89 PL species were quantified, namely phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, plasmalogen, and ceramide. Importantly, equine SF contains about half of the PL content determined in human SF with some characteristic changes in PL composition. Nutritional habits, decreased apolipoprotein levels and altered enzymatic activities may have caused the observed different PL profiles. Our study provides comprehensive quantitative data on PL species levels in normal human and equine knee SF so that research in joint diseases and articular lubrication can be facilitated."
https://openalex.org/W3152855896,"This paper employs the multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA) model to estimate the nonlinear relationship between the money market rate and stock market liquidity in China from a multifractal perspective, leading to a better understanding of the complexity in the relationship between the interest rate and stock market liquidity. The empirical results show that the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity present antipersistence in the long run and that they tend to be positively persistent in the short run. The negative cross-correlations between the interest rate and stock market liquidity are more significant than the positive cross-correlations. Furthermore, the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity display multifractal characteristics, explaining the variations in the relationship between the interest rate and stock market liquidity at different time scales. In addition, the lower degree of multifractality in the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity confirms that it is effective for the interest rate to control stock market liquidity. The Chinese stock market liquidity is more sensitive to fluctuations in the money market rate in the short term and is inelastic in response to the money market rate in the long term. In particular, the positive cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity in the short run become strong in periods of crises and emergencies. All the evidence proves that the interest rate policy is an emergency response rather than an effective response to mounting concerns regarding the economic impact of unexpected exogenous emergencies and that the interest rate cut policy will not be as effective as expected."
https://openalex.org/W3152857445,"Genetic studies have shifted to sequencing-based rare variants discovery after decades of success in identifying common disease variants by Genome-Wide Association Studies using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism chips. Sequencing-based studies require large sample sizes for statistical power and therefore often inadvertently introduce batch effects because samples are typically collected, processed, and sequenced at multiple centers. Conventionally, batch effects are first detected and visualized using Principal Components Analysis and then controlled by including batch covariates in the disease association models. For sequencing-based genetic studies, because all variants included in the association analyses have passed sequencing-related quality control measures, this conventional approach treats every variant as equal and ignores the substantial differences still remaining in variant qualities and characteristics such as genotype quality scores, alternative allele fractions (fraction of reads supporting alternative allele at a variant position) and sequencing depths. In the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) exome dataset of 9,904 cases and controls, we discovered hidden variant-level differences between sample batches of three sequencing centers and two exome capture kits. Although sequencing centers were included as a covariate in our association models, we observed differences at the variant level in genotype quality and alternative allele fraction between samples processed by different exome capture kits that significantly impacted both the confidence of variant detection and the identification of disease-associated variants. Furthermore, we found that a subset of top disease-risk variants came exclusively from samples processed by one exome capture kit that was more effective at capturing the alternative alleles compared to the other kit. Our findings highlight the importance of additional variant-level quality control for large sequencing-based genetic studies. More importantly, we demonstrate that automatically filtering out variants with batch differences may lead to false negatives if the batch discordances come largely from quality differences and if the batch-specific variants have better quality."
https://openalex.org/W3156260465,"Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is one of the major causes of cancer-related death worldwide with increasing incidences, however there are very few studies about the underlying mechanisms and pathways in the development of LIHC. We obtained LIHC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to screen differentially expressed mRNAs, lncRNAs, miRNAs and driver mutations. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Gene ontology enrichment analyses and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network were performed. Moreover, we constructed a competing endogenous lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs network. Finally, cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify important prognostic differentially expressed genes. Total of 1284 mRNAs, 123 lncRNAs, 47 miRNAs were identified within different tissues of LIHC patients. GO analysis indicated that upregulated and downregulated differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were mainly associated with cell division, DNA replication, mitotic sister chromatid segregation and complement activation respectively. Meanwhile, KEGG terms revealed that upregulated and downregulated DEmRNAs were primarily involved in DNA replication, Metabolic pathways, cell cycle and Metabolic pathways, chemical carcinogenesis, retinol metabolism pathway respectively. Among the DERNAs, 542 lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs pairs were predicted to construct a ceRNA regulatory network including 35 DElncRNAs, 26 DEmiRNAs and 112 DEmRNAs. In the Kaplan‐Meier analysis, total of 43 mRNAs, 14 lncRNAs and 3 miRNAs were screened out to be significantly correlated with overall survival of LIHC. The mutation signatures were analyzed and its correlation with immune infiltrates were evaluated using the TIMER in LIHC. Among the mutation genes, TTN mutation is often associated with poor immune infiltration and a worse prognosis in LIHC. This work conducted a novel lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs network and mutation signatures for finding potential molecular mechanisms underlying the development of LIHC. The biomarkers also can be used for predicting prognosis of LIHC."

However, the pension adequacy and its effect on the sustainability of a national pension system are still understudied. Using actual replacement rate and modified living standards replacement rate, this study empirically evaluates whether China’s New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS) grants enough livelihood protection for the rural residents in the Northwestern China. The results show that the NRPS fails to meet the basic needs of the elderly people (i.e., age of sixty years or older) or the middle-aged people (forty-five to fifty-nine years old), while it only provides limited protection for the young people (sixteen to forty-four years old). These findings suggest that the current NRPS benefits are very low in the Northwestern China and policy reforms should be further implemented to improve the sustainable development of the New Rural Pension Scheme."

LACV is transmitted via the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. Thus, it is imperative to understand the dynamics of the local vector population in order to assess risk and transmission. Using entomological data collected from Knox County, Tennessee in 2013, we formulate an environmentally-driven system of ordinary differential equations to model mosquito population dynamics over a single season. Further, we include infected compartments to represent LACV transmission within the mosquito population. Findings suggest that the model, with dependence on degree days and accumulated precipitation, can closely describe field data. This model confirms the need to include these environmental variables when planning control strategies."

https://openalex.org/W3156635746,"The single mitochondrial nucleoid (kinetoplast) of Trypanosoma brucei is found proximal to a basal body (mature (mBB)/probasal body (pBB) pair). Kinetoplast inheritance requires synthesis of, and scission of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) generating two kinetoplasts that segregate with basal bodies into daughter cells. Molecular details of kinetoplast scission and the extent to which basal body separation influences the process are unavailable. To address this topic, we followed basal body movements in bloodstream trypanosomes following depletion of protein kinase TbCK1.2 which promotes kinetoplast division. In control cells we found that pBBs are positioned 0.4 um from mBBs in G1, and they mature after separating from mBBs by at least 0.8 um: mBB separation reaches ~2.2 um. These data indicate that current models of basal body biogenesis in which pBBs mature in close proximity to mBBs may need to be revisited. Knockdown of TbCK1.2 produced trypanosomes containing one kinetoplast and two nuclei (1K2N), increased the percentage of cells with uncleaved kDNA 400%, decreased mBB spacing by 15%, and inhibited cytokinesis 300%. We conclude that (a) separation of mBBs beyond a threshold of 1.8 um correlates with division of kDNA, and (b) TbCK1.2 regulates kDNA scission. We propose a Kinetoplast Division Factor hypothesis that integrates these data into a pathway for biogenesis of two daughter mitochondrial nucleoids."
https://openalex.org/W3152988577,"Background Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is amongst the most important factors complicating solid organ transplantation. In a large prospective randomized clinical trial, valganciclovir prophylaxis reduced the occurrence of CMV infection and disease compared with preemptive therapy in CMV-positive renal allograft recipients (VIPP study; NCT00372229). Here, we present a subanalysis of the VIPP study, investigating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune-response-related genes and their association with active CMV infection, CMV disease, graft loss or death, rejection, infections, and leukopenia. Methods Based on literature research ten SNPs were analyzed for TLR4 , three for IFN-γ , six for IL10 , nine for IL37 , and two for TNF-α . An asymptotic independence test (Cochran-Armitage trend test) was used to examine associations between SNPs and the occurrence of CMV infection or other negative outcomes. Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05 and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was performed. Results SNPs were analyzed on 116 blood samples. No associations were found between the analyzed SNPs and the occurrence of CMV infection, rejection and leukopenia in all patients. For IL37 rs2723186, an association with CMV disease (p = 0.0499), for IL10 rs1800872, with graft loss or death (p = 0.0207) and for IL10 rs3024496, with infections (p = 0.0258) was observed in all patients, however did not hold true after correction for multiple testing. Conclusion The study did not reveal significant associations between the analyzed SNPs and the occurrence of negative outcomes in CMV-positive renal transplant recipients after correction for multiple testing. The results of this association analysis may be of use in guiding future research efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3154945390,"Background The study aims to determine possible dose-volume response relationships between the rectum, sigmoid colon and small intestine and the ‘excessive mucus discharge’ syndrome after pelvic radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer. Methods and materials From a larger cohort, 98 gynaecological cancer survivors were included in this study. These survivors, who were followed for 2 to 14 years, received external beam radiation therapy but not brachytherapy and not did not have stoma. Thirteen of the 98 developed excessive mucus discharge syndrome. Three self-assessed symptoms were weighted together to produce a score interpreted as ‘excessive mucus discharge’ syndrome based on the factor loadings from factor analysis. The dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for rectum, sigmoid colon, small intestine for each survivor were exported from the treatment planning systems. The dose-volume response relationships for excessive mucus discharge and each organ at risk were estimated by fitting the data to the Probit, RS, LKB and gEUD models. Results The small intestine was found to have steep dose-response curves, having estimated dose-response parameters: γ 50 : 1.28, 1.23, 1.32, D 50 : 61.6, 63.1, 60.2 for Probit, RS and LKB respectively. The sigmoid colon (AUC: 0.68) and the small intestine (AUC: 0.65) had the highest AUC values. For the small intestine, the DVHs for survivors with and without excessive mucus discharge were well separated for low to intermediate doses; this was not true for the sigmoid colon. Based on all results, we interpret the results for the small intestine to reflect a relevant link. Conclusion An association was found between the mean dose to the small intestine and the occurrence of ‘excessive mucus discharge’. When trying to reduce and even eliminate the incidence of ‘excessive mucus discharge’, it would be useful and important to separately delineate the small intestine and implement the dose-response estimations reported in the study."

This study investigated the home range and movement of echidnas in western New South Wales. Radio telemetry tracking was used to locate the echidnas daily during the study period (March-May 2018, November 2018, March-May 2019 and August 2019); the observed home range was 1.47± 1.21km 2 . This is over twice the reported home range of temperate environments (&lt;0.65km 2 ), suggesting that echidnas exhibit larger home ranges in arid zones. The home range of individual echidnas ranged from 0.02km 2 to 3.56km 2 . Echidnas exhibited a small degree of overlap (6.6%± 19.8%) but this varied considerably between individuals (between 0 to 84.2% overlap.) Four out of the thirteen echidnas died during this study, likely due to the severe drought that occurred during the study. This study provides insight into the movement and home range of echidnas in arid zones, revealing that desert echidnas have large home ranges, probably dependent on the availability of resources."
https://openalex.org/W3156050002,"It was a beautiful August day, and I was on a socially distanced hike with friends along the Appalachian Trail. But instead of enjoying the scenery, I was distracted by my phone. It kept buzzing in my pocket as hundreds of Twitter notifications flooded in. I had been on Twitter for about a year, mainly tweeting about science. I enjoyed it, but none of my tweets ever got much traction—until that day. I was excited—and nervous. Was I ready to be Twitter famous?



> “I am not an expert on academic life, but … sharing my experiences is still useful and rewarding.” 

I had spent much of the previous day wrestling with data files prepared by a junior co-worker, first using the version they named “final” only to find that the actual values I needed were in a file named “final2.” After I sorted it out, I sent a quick—hopefully polite and constructive—email saying that we needed to do a better job naming our shared files. Late that night, I was awoken by a notification on my phone: My colleague had emailed with an apology and assurance that they would do better in the future. Unable to go back to sleep, I decided to tweet a brief comment about the importance of properly naming research files, hoping that some of my few dozen followers would benefit. To my astonishment, it was retweeted by a high-profile academic account, and it had blown up by morning.

Before that point, my tweets had been limited to sharing research results, without adding any personal perspective. I was hesitant to share my thoughts or experiences, thinking no one would care—or, worse, that colleagues and potential future employers might misinterpret them. After all, who was I to offer advice? I'm just a Ph.D. student doing my best; I didn't know whether I was doing anything right myself!

But seeing people from across academia retweeting me and agreeing with my point shifted my mindset. Maybe I do have something to offer.

Since then, I have been regularly tweeting about my experiences as a Ph.D. student, including navigating authorship conflicts, maintaining work-life balance, mentoring undergraduate students, giving presentations, writing, and more. Some tweets inspire a lot of responses, others fewer. Regardless, I've found that I enjoy offering my perspective. I am not an expert on academic life, but I've learned that I don't need to pretend to be. Sharing my experiences is still useful and rewarding.

I recently posted about the personal statement component of graduate school applications. I recalled struggling with this when I first applied to Ph.D. programs, as an international student with no scientist family members to advise me. I searched the internet for advice and crafted my application as well as I could, but my statement mostly ticked off items from my CV. I didn't get into most of the places where I applied. One school invited me to a master's program, though, and I enrolled. When I applied for Ph.D. programs again a few years later, my experience in academia and my mentor's advice led me to take a different approach to the personal statement. I focused on the ideas I wished to pursue, and wrote about how my background and the school I was applying to were a good fit. This time, most programs offered me a spot. I thought others might benefit from the insight I had gained, so I posted a series of tweets.

Many students reached out, thanking me and asking follow-up questions. One first-generation student in Nigeria—someone I would never have connected with were I not active on Twitter—asked me whether I had time to provide feedback about their statement, which I was honored to do. The student also mentioned how they benefited from my posts and the discussions they spurred, which reinforced my motivation to keep at it.

Although I sometimes feel uncomfortable and vulnerable sharing my experiences on a massive global platform, I've found that it is well worth it. I've learned that we are all stronger if we authentically share and connect with one another."
