https://openalex.org/W2012083162,"The T4 DNA topoisomerase is a recently discovered multisubunit protein that appears to have an essential role in the initiation of T4 bacteriophage DND replication. Treatment of double-stranded circular DNA with large amounts of this topoisomerase in the absence of ATP yields new DNA species which are knotted topological isomers of the double-stranded DNA circle. These knotted DNA circles, whether covalently closed or nicked, are converted to unknotted circles by treatment with trace amounts of the T4 topoisomerase in the presence of ATP. Very similar ATP-dependent enzyme activities capable of unknotting DNA are present in extracts of Drosophila eggs. Xenopus laevis eggs and mammalian tissue culture cells. The procaryotic enzyme, DNA gyrase, is also capable of unknotting DNA. We propose that these unknotting enzymes constitute a new general class of DNA topoisomerases (type II DNA topoisomerases). These enzymes must act via mechanisms that involve the concerted cleavage and rejoining of two opposite DNA strands, such that the DNA double helix is transiently broken. The passage of a second double-stranded DNA segment through this reversible double-strand break results in a variety of DNA topoisomerization reactions, including relaxation:super-coiling; knotting:unknotting and catenation:decatenation. In support of this type of mechanism, we demonstrate that the T4 DNA topoisomerase changes the linking number of a covalently closed double-stranded circular DNA molecule only by multiples of two. We discuss the possible roles of such enzymes in a variety of biological functions, along with their probable molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1968916548,"A recombinant plasmid containing a MATα mating type locus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been isolated by its ability to complement a sterile matα mutation. The plasmid hybridizes to restriction fragments containing both active mating type loci (MATa and MATα) and both silent mating type loci (HMRa and HMLα). All loci therefore have common sequences. Recombinant lambda clones of the loci have been isolated by plaque hybridization and their structures have been compared by a heteroduplex analysis. At its center, each locus contains one of two apparently nonhomologous sequences. Loci concerned with the α phenotype (MATα and HMLα) contain an 850 bp α-specific sequence, whereas loci concerned with the a phenotype (MATa and HMRa) contain a 700 bp a-specific sequence. The a- or α-specific sequences are surrounded by DNA sequences that are common to all loci. These homologous sequences extend for 230 bp on the left and 700 bp on the right. They appear to be unrelated to each other. Surprisingly, HMLα and HMRa differ in their extent of homology to MATa and MATα outside the above regions. HMRa lacks an extensive (700 bp) DNA sequence to the right of the large right-hand homologous region, and possibly also a small (90 bp) sequence to the left of the small left-hand homologous region, both of which are present at HMLα, MATa and MATα. Hybridization studies have shown that the 700 bp sequence is present at HMLa but absent at HMRα alleles. It is therefore characteristic of HML, irrespective of whether it contains a- or α-specific sequences. The results imply that mating type interconversion is effected by transposition of DNA sequences from HML or HMR to MAT, as predicted by the controlling element model of Oshima and Takano, 1971 Oshima Y.

https://openalex.org/W2012184072,"The inverted repeats of Tn5, which have identical restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns, have different functional properties. They differ with respect to RNA polymerase binding, full promotion of neomycin resistance, the polypeptides coded for by the repeats and their function in the transposition process. There is a week RNA polymerase binding site present in one repeat and not in the other which seems to be important for neomycin resistance. The two inverted repeats code for polypeptides of different molecular weights, with each repeat appearing to encode two polypeptides. The polypeptides from only one of the repeats of Tn5 appear to be absolutely required for Tn5 transposition."
https://openalex.org/W1585637747,"The tetrameric form of a Desulfovibrio gigas ferredoxin, named Fd II, mediates electron transfer between cytochrome c3 and sulfite reductase. We have studied two stable oxidation states of this protein with Mossbauer spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We found 3 iron atoms/monomer and a spin concentration of 0.9 spins/monomer for the oxidized protein. Taken together, the EPR and Mossbauer data demonstrate conclusively the presence of a spin-coupled structure containing 3 iron atoms and labile sulfur. The Mossbauer data show also that this metal center is structurally similar, if not identical, with the low potential center of a ferredoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii, a novel cluster described recently (Emptage, M.H., Kent, T.A., Huynh, B.H., Rawlings, J., Orme-Johnson, W.H., and Munck, E.

https://openalex.org/W1633463671,"The effect of different divalent metal ions on the hydrolysis of DNA by DNase I was studied with an assay which distinguishes between cleavage of one or both strands of the DNA substrate during initial encounters between enzyme and DNA. Using covalently closed superhelical SV40(I) DNA as substrate, initial reaction products consisting of relaxed circles or unit-length linears are resolved by electrophoresis of radioactively labeled DNA in agarose gels. Only in the presence of a transition metal ion, such as Mn2+ or Co2+, and only under certain reaction conditions, is DNase I able to cut both DNA strands at or near the same point, generating unit-length linears. This ability to cut both DNA strands is inhibited by such factors as temperature decrease, the addition of a monovalent ion or another divalent cation which is not a transition metal ion, or a reduction in the number of superhelical turns in the DNA substrate. All of these factors lead to a winding of the duplex helix and antagonize the unwinding of the duplex promoted by transition metal ion binding. Transition metal ions may thus convert the DNA substrate locally to a form in which DNase I can introduce breaks into both strands. In the presence of Mg2+, DNase I introduces single strand nicks into SV40(I), generating exclusively the covalently open, relaxed circular SV40(II) as the initial product of the reaction. In the presence of Mn2+, DNase I generates as initial products a mixture of SV40(II) and unit-length SV40 linear DNA molecules, formed by two nicks in opposite strands at or near the same point in the duplex. These circular SV40(II) molecules consist of two types. A minority class is indistinguishable from the nicked SV40(II) produced by DNase I in the presence of Mg2+. The majority class consists of molecules containing a gap in one of the two strands, the mean length of the gap being 11 nucleotides. The SV40(L) molecules produced in the presence of Mn2+ appear to have single strand extensions at one or both ends."
https://openalex.org/W2110458663,"The 5-methylcytosine content of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-specific DNA sequences acquired by both milk-borne infection and genetic transmission was determined for both normal and neoplastic tissues of the mouse. Using the restriction endonuclease Msp I, which cleaves at the recognition sequence 5′-CCGG, and its isoschizomer Hpa II, which is inhibited by methylation of the cytosine base of the CpG dinucleotide, it can be demonstrated that MMTV proviruses acquired via germ line infection are extensively methylated at both the site for Msp I-Hpa II cleavage and the site for Hha I (5′-GCGC), which is also inhibited by base modification of the cytosine. The virus-specific sequences acquired via milk-borne infection, however, are not modified at these sites in DNA from either normal infected or transformed tissues. Finally, cellular sequences are nonspecifically hypomethylated in a phenomenon unique to transformed tissue and apparently unrelated to the specific hypomethylation of exogenously acquired MMTV proviruses."

https://openalex.org/W2095442303,"A high-molecular-weight protein with β-endorphin- and adrenocorticotropin-immunoreactivities was isolated from extracts of human placenta after several purification steps, including immunoadsorption with a well-characterized antiserum raised to β-endorphin. This protein was identified as the heavy chain of the human immunoglobulin class IgG1. These results have led to the recognition of homologies in the amino acid sequences of these physiologically unrelated molecules. They also suggest caution in accepting immunological competence as the sole criterion of the chemical identity of a ligand."

https://openalex.org/W1981718777,"Hamster sera raised against SV40 tumors contain antibodies which recognize the SV40 large and small T antigens. IgG from such sera and from preimmune hamster serum has been purified and injected into green monkey kidney cells and murine fibroblasts infected with SV40. The results of these maneuvers were marked and selective immune IgG inhibition of SV40 DNA synthesis in the former case and a substantial reduction in virus-induced abortive transformation in the latter. The immune IgG fraction used in these studies lacked detectable antibody against any of the late viral proteins. Furthermore, it was inhibitory to both of these processes when injected 6 hr after virus infection. Thus the observed inhibition does not result from a block to viral penetration and uncoating. Injection of immune IgG did not significantly reduce the viability of SV40-infected murine fibroblasts. Moreover, the cloning efficiency in methylcellulose of an isogenic cell line transformed by murine sarcoma virus was not specifically inhibited by immune IgG injection. In addition, when parallel cultures of a rat fibroblast line infected by either polyoma or SV40 were injected with immune or preimmune IgG, only the immune IgG-injected, SV40-infected culture sustained a reduction in subsequent cloning efficiency in methylcellulose. In keeping with this result, the immune IgG used had no detectable affinity for the large, middle or small polyoma T antigens. Thus we conclude that injection of antibody from anti-SV40 tumor sera into SV40-infected cells results in a significant blockade of elements of large and/or small T antigen function."

https://openalex.org/W2058388959,"The food dye erythrosine (Erythrosin B; FD & C No. 3) was applied to isolated neuromuscular synapses in the frog, and its effects on the spontaneous quantal release of acetylcholine were examined with electrophysiological techniques. At concentrations of 10 muM or greater this anionic dye produced an irreversible, dose-dependent increase in neurotransmitter release. This increase did not depend on the presence of calcium ions in the bathing medium. These increase did not depend on the presence of calcium ions in the bathing medium. These results suggest that erythrosine might prove a useful pharmacological tool for studying the process of transmitter release, but that its use as a food additive should be reexamined."

Biol. 98, 503-517). Remarkably, no cell line contained an intact distal portion of the early gene region which encodes a portion of the large T antigen. All cell lines examined contained the PY DNA Bum I fragment which contains most of the genetic information encoding PY small and middle T antigens, as well as the origin of viral DNA replication. These results provide an explanation for our previous observation that PY virus-induced hamster tumors do not contain the large species of T antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1604834929,"Isolated myocytes were prepared from adult canine hearts using a combined technique of myocardial perfusion followed by incubation with collagenase. More than 60% of the cells routinely excluded trypan blue dye. Disruption of the myocytes was accomplished using high pressure nitrogen cavitation. After differential and sucrose gradient centrifugation, the peak sarcolemmal fraction averaged 100-fold enrichment in ouabain-inhibited K+-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase and 82-fold in ouabain-inhibited (Na+,K+)-ATPase. These sarcolemmal membranes are enriched in phospholipid phosphorus (1.98 mumol/mg of protein) and more than 4-fold in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Polyacrylamide gels revealed three major protein peaks at 50,000, 91,000, and 140,000 apparent molecular weights. This work demonstrates the feasibility of preparing highly pure cardiac sarcolemma from isolated adult myocytes. The problem of cellular cross-contamination due to heterogeneity of cell types in whole myocardial tissue has been circumvented. The level of enrichment exceeds all reported preparations of cardiac sarcolemma from whole myocardium and cultured myocytes. This preparation should prove to be useful as an in vitro model for studies of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological perturbations of sarcolemmal structure and function."

Several recombinant plaques were identified by their ability to hybridize to 32P-labeled cDNA prepared from fetal sheep tendon type I procollagen mRNA. Two of these recombinant DNA bacteriophages (SpC3 and SpC7) were identified as containing procollagen pro alpha 2 gene sequences by their ability to specifically anneal to procollagen pro alpha 2 mRNA. Restriction endonuclease and hybridization to a cloned pro alpha 2 cDNA demonstrated that approximately half (2.5 kilobases) of the pro alpha 2 mRNA sequence is distributed over 15 kilobases of genomic DNA. Restriction maps of SpC3 and SpC7 demonstrated that these two DNA fragments contain overlapping sequences of the pro alpha 2 gene. Electron microscopy and R-loop analysis of SpC3 revealed that at least 12 to 16 intervening sequences are distributed throughout the length of this gene fragment."

https://openalex.org/W1541732205,"Effects of K+ and Na+ on the transient state kinetics of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase from Electrophorus electricus were examined. Exposure of the enzyme to K+ for brief intervals prior to the addition of ATP and Na+ converts the enzyme to a form (E2 . K) which is transiently less reactive than when all three ligands are added simultaneously. Enzyme is reconverted to the rapidly reacting (E1) form if Na+ is added prior to ATP. Exposure of the ATPase to K+ without Na+ for 1 to 2 h partially restores the initial phosphate (Pi) burst but greatly depresses the amount of phosphoprotein intermediate (E-P) observed. Experiments in the presence of valinomycin suggest that much of this depression in E-P is related to the presence of sealed vesicles with K+ sites sequestered in the interior. Although the results are largely consistent with a simple model in which ATP hydrolysis occurs only through the phosphoenzyme intermediate, the partial restoration of the Pi burst following long term exposure to K+ appears to be attributable to a slow change which may allow some ATP hydrolysis to occur within formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W2087947642,"Chi sites stimulate generalized recombination catalyzed by the RecA-RecBC-dependent system of E. coli. This stimulation occurs over a region of several thousand base pairs surrounding the Chi site. These sites arise by mutation at four distinct loci in bacteriophage lambda. We report here the nucleotide sequence surrounding one of these loci, chi B, located between the xis and reda genes. Alteration of a single GC base pair, by deletion or by transversion to a CG base pair, creates the Chi recombinational hotspot chi + B. In a section of 30 bp, the chi + B sequence has 23 bp in common with the chi + C sequence determined previously. We presume that some part of this common sequence is the recognition sequence for a protein which acts at a rate-limiting step of generalized recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2020008749,"We have analyzed the RNA genome of RadLV/VL3, a highly oncogenic murine leukemia virus. This virus is produced by a permanent cell line derived from a radiation leukemia virus-induced thymic lymphoma of C57BL/Ka mice. Two distinct RNA components were found in the virions: a 70S dimer containing two 8 kb RNA subunits and a 54S dimer containing two 5.6 kb RNAs. A nononcogenic retrovirus, BL/Ka(B), endogenous in the same strain of mice, contains only 8 kb viral RNA subunits. The linkages between both RadLV/VL3 dimers have identical thermal stabilities. Both dimers can serve as primer templates for reverse transcriptase and both produce very similar ""strong-stop"" cDNAs 147 +/- 1 bases long. Sequences at the 5' end of the 5.6 kb subunit contain the genes for the viral proteins p15 and p12, but the gene for p30 is either absent or partially deleted. In vitro translation of the 5.6 kb RNA yields a 100,000 molecular weight protein containing antigenic determinants which react with antibody to p15 but not with antibody to p30. In addition, cells producing RadLV/VL3 virus synthesize a novel of 1.6 kb poly(A)-containing cytoplasmic RNA which shows very little if any homology with BL/Ka(B) viral sequences."

Screening of 150,000 plaques from this library using radioactive beta-globin gene sequences resulted in the isolation of two recombinant bacteriophage containing globin genes. One of these, S beta AG-21, contains the complete adult beta A-globin gene as demonstrated by hybridization and restriction endonuclease analysis. In common with adult globin genes from other species, the beta A gene contains small (105 base pairs) and large (900 base pairs) intervening sequences. The second recombinant bacteriophage, SG-4, contains a complete embryonic beta-like globin gene which is expressed in the sheep embryo as demonstrated by hybridization analysis with cDNA made from sheep embryonic globin mRNA. Although differing in its restriction endonuclease map from the adult beta-globin genes, SG-4 appears to contain a large intervening sequence of at least 750 base pairs in length. Finally, preliminary evidence is discussed which indicates that a Pvu II site just 5' to the Cap site may be a common feature of sheep globin genes."

https://openalex.org/W1558595231,"Liver glycogen phosphorylase associated with the glycogen pellet was activated by a MgATP-dependent process. This activation was reduced by 90% by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, not affected by the inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and increased 2.5-fold by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Low levels of free Ca2+ (8 x 10(-8) M) completely prevented the effects of the chelator. The activation of phosphorylase by MgATP was shown not to be due to formation of AMP. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the glycogen pellet separated phosphorylase from phosphorylase kinase. The isolated phosphorylase was no longer activated by MgATP in the presence or absence of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The isolated phosphorylase kinase phosphorylated and activated skeletal muscle phosphorylase b and the activation was increased 2- to 3-fold by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Mixing the isolated phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase together restored the effects of MgATP and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase on phosphorylase activity. These findings demonstrate that the phosphorylase kinase associated with liver glycogen has regulatory features similar to those of muscle phosphorylase kinase."

Puglisi (1978) Biochemistry 17, 1154-1160) it was anticipated that actinomycin D in a low concentration would bind to DNA which is involved in the regulation of rRNA transcription in eukaryotes. This was examined by digestion of rat (liver) DNA with EcoRI, adding [3H]actinomycin D (0.004 microgram/ml) and resolution of the restriction fragments by RPC-5 chromatography. Labeled actinomycin D was found to bind with highest affinity to a single fraction consistently eluting at 0.63 M KCl. A similar digestion and fractionation of nucleolar DNA, which is enriched in rDNA sequences, did not reveal a similar high affinity binding of actinomycin D. This fraction of DNA which binds actinomycin D with highest affinity did not contain any rDNA as evidenced by hybridization with [32P]rRNA. Therefore, at the concentration of 0.004 microgram/ml, actinomycin D does not selectively bind to rDNA as evidenced by two independent criteria. Whether this high affinity actinomycin D-binding DNA has any function in the regulation of rRNA transcription remains to be determined."
