https://openalex.org/W2093896423,"It is generally accepted that the differentiated state of a given type of cell is associated with the activity of a particular set of genes, together with the total inactivity of those sets associated with the differentiation of other cell types. It is also clear that the differentiated state of dividing or nondividing cells is often extremely stable. In this article we suggest mechanisms that may account for this stability and that also attempt to explain the ordered switching on or off of genes during development. The phenotype of the organism depends on the genotype, and the genetic contribution from both parents is in almost all cases equal. Since the ultimate control of development resides in the genetic material, the actual program must be written in base sequences in the DNA. It is also clear that cytoplasmic components can have a powerful or overriding influence on genomic activity in particular cells, yet these cytoplasmic components are, of course, usually derived from the activity of genes at some earlier stage in development. A continual interaction between cytoplasmic enzymes and DNA sequences is an essential part of the model to be presented. Modification Enzymes In bacteria, enzymes exist which modify DNA by methylating adenine in the 6-position ( 1 ). These enzymes are extremely specific in their action; they modify bases at particular positions in short defined sequences of DNA, which, at least in some instances, form a palindrome. (A palindrome in DNA is an inverted duplication, with twofold rotational symmetry. The 3′ →..."

Influences of world bias appear to be superimposed upon an already laterally dichotomized population. Initial left-right sense, it is posited, arises as an outcome of a seemingly random process."
https://openalex.org/W1585661349,"Phosphate transport across the membrane of human erythrocytes, at pH 6.42, is a saturable process with an external Km of 80 mM and a Vmax of 2.8 mmol per liter of red cells per min. Transport is inhibited in a reversible manner by the sulfanilate anion and in an irreversible manner by the isothiocyanate derivative of the sulfanilate anion. This reagent reacts with only one membrane protein. When 300,000 molecules of reagent per cell are covalently attached to protein, transport is completely inhibited. This transport protein is a glycoprotein, it belongs to the general class designated as component a by Bretscher, and it therefore spans the bilayer. Transport does not involve movement of the protein around an axis parallel to the plane of the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1546433789,"Abstract The lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination technique was utilized to incorporate radioactive iodine into membrane proteins which lie on the outer surface of the myelin sheath. An intact, myelinated nerve bundle, the dorsal column of the cat spinal cord, was employed. The enzymatically iodinated proteins were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the specific radioactivity was determined. Results indicated that several high molecular weight proteins were predominantly labeled by the nonpenetrating lactopreoxidase. Proteolipid protein was also labeled, although to a lesser extent; basic protein was not labeled under these conditions. The data suggest that several high molecular weight proteins are exposed on the outer surface of the myelin sheath. Proteolipid protein is at least partially exposed on the outer surface, although it could be present at both membrane surfaces. Evidence is presented which suggests that the basic protein is located at the inner surface of the membrane, corresponding to the major dense line of myelin."
https://openalex.org/W1568427065,"A specific color reaction has been developed for the detection of N-7, N-8-(1,2-dihydroxycyclohex-1,2-ylene)-L-arginine-containing peptides. The reaction is based on the fact that hydroxylamine converts the blocking group to cyclohexanedione dioxime, which forms a red nickel complex. N-7, N-8-(1,2-dihydroxycyclohex-1,2-ylene)-L-arginine-containing peptides can also be detected by diagonal electrophoresis from the change of electrophoretic mobility of these peptides on interaction of the blocking group with borate. Since the modified arginine residues are resistant to tryptic cleavate, changes in tryptic peptide patterns can also be utilized to identify the presence of modified arginine residues. A combination of these approaches was used to identify the arginine residues modified by cyclohexanedione treatment. Bovine panctreatic RNase A loses approximately 90% of its activity on cyclohexanedione treatment with the modification of 2 to 3 arginine residues. Arginine-39 reacts most rapidly and its modification contributes most to inactivation of the enzyme. Arginine-85 also reacts rapidly with cyclohexanedione. Arginine-10 reacts slowly and no reaction was observed with arginine-33. Removal of the blocking groups by hydroxylamine treatment resulted in complete recovery of enzyme activity in samples where arginine-39 and arginine-85 had been modified, whereas 80% of activity was regained from samples where arginine-10 had also been modified. With egg white lysozyme, all 11 arginine residues react with cyclohexanedione, resulting in partial inactivation of the enzyme. The fully modified enzyme retains 35% of its activity. Since arginine residues are important for electrostatic interaction between the enzyme and the negatively charges cell surface, even the modified, basic residues can provide the necessary positive charges. In the presence of borate, activity is almost completely abolished, since the modified arginine-borate complex has a reduced net positive charge. Upon removal of the blocking groups by hydroxylamine, even the fully modified lysozyme regains complete activity. With the exception of the most reactive arginine (residue 5), modification of all other arginine residues contributes equally to inactivation of the enzyme. The possible reason for the importance of arginine-5 in maintaining activity is discussed. Advantages of the present method for the selective reversible modification of arginine residues of proteins and for the identification of reactive arginine residues are evaluated."

Four of the transferases are required for the synthesis of gangliosides, and three for the synthesis of the terminal trisaccharide units of serum type glycoproteins. Six of the transferases were found only in the particulate fraction of homogenates, while one (UDP-galactose:glycoprotein galactosyltransferase) was found both in the paritculate and soluble fractions of young embryonic chicken brain, but only in the particulate fraction obtained from older embryos. The source of the soluble galactosyltransferase was found to be the fluid surrounding the embryonic brain.

Test squares presented in the upper hemifield were detectable at consistently shorter durations than those in the lower hemifield when the fixation marker was in front of the surround, and vice versa when the marker was behind. No such anisotropy was found for left and right hemifield. Esploratory studies suggested a similar up-down anisotropy and left-right isotropy in spatial resolution. Thus, the upper hemifield representation at the cortex shows a general superiority over the lower one for vinocular detectors tuned to uncrossed disparitites, and the lower hemifield shows superiority for those tuned to crossed disparities."
https://openalex.org/W2160559912,"SUMMARY Lactate oxidase from Mycobacterium smegmatis is strongly inhibited by oxalate. The inhibition is reversible in the absence and irreversible in the presence of light. Oxalate is bound to the enzyme in a two-step process with an over-all Kd of 1.6 X 10e5 M. The first step is a fast second order reaction with kkl/kl = 8.3 X 10e3 M, leading to a Complex I. This complex is then reversibly converted to a different Complex II in a slow first order reaction (kz = 40 minP; kkz = 0.07 min-I), which is accompanied by major spectral perturbations of the flavin spectrum. With oxamate, two steps could not be demonstrated, and its binding is described by a single step reversible process, which is second order in oxamate (ki = 6.8 X lo3 M-I s-l, khl = 28 s-l). Upon ilhrmination the enzyme-oxalate Complex II is converted very rapidly into a reduced flavoenzyme with carbonate covalently bound at position N(5) of the flavin. Slow hydrolysis in the dark under anaerobic conditions subsequently yields free reduced enzyme. The light reaction of the oxamate complex is, in contrast, very slow and yields a stable N(5) urea adduct of the reduced flavin."

https://openalex.org/W1558660308,"The effects of additions of Mg-2+, ribosomes, and AUG codon on the Met-tRNAf Met-initiation factor-GTP complex were studied using a Millipore filtration method (J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4500 (1973)). Upon addition of increasing concentration of Mg-2+, the Met-tRNAf Met-initiation factor-GTP complex dissociates into free Met-tRNAf Met and initiation factor (GTP), with an infection around 1.5 to 2 mM Mg-2+. The Mg-2+-induced dissociation of Met-tRNAf Met-initiation factor-GTP complex was enhanced at ice bath temperature. At 37 degrees and in the presence of 1.5 to 2mM Mg-2+, the Met-tRNAf Met-initiation factor-GTP complex catalyzes the transfer of Met-tRNAf Met to ribosomes and AUG codon. Ribosome bound Met-tRNAf Met is stable to Mg-2+ and low temperature. A Millipore filtration assay for studies of (35S)Met-tRNAf Met binding to ribosomes and Aug codon has been developed. The assay procedure is carried out in three stages. In Stage I, the Met-tRNAf Met is bound to initiation factor in the presence of GTP, AUG codon (required for Stage II reaction), and 3.7 times 10-5 M aurintricarboxylic acid. The incubation is carried out at 37 degrees for 5 min. In Stage II, ribosomes and Mg-2+ (1.5 to 2mM final concentration) are added and the incubation is continued at 37 degrees for 10 min. In Stage III, more Mg-2+ is added to make the final Mg-2+ concentration of the incubation mixture 5 mM, and the reactions are further incubated at ice bath temperature for 10 min. The reactions are then terminated by addition of excess cold wash buffer and filtered through Millipore filters. Under the standard assay conditions, the radioactivity bound to Millipore filters in the absence of ribosomes and AUG codon is markedly reduced. Addition of ribosomes alone gave a significant increase in the radioactivity bound to Millipore filters. A further 2- to 3-fold stimulation of binding of (35S)Met-tRNAf Met to Millipore filters was observed when both ribosomes and AUG codon were added. The Met-tRNAf Met bound to ribosomes under the assay condition was reactive with puromycin. Upon DEAE-cellulose chromatography of a partially purified mixture of initiation factors (IF), Met-tRNAf Met binding activities separate into two forms, and are designated as IF-1A and IF-1B. These two forms can be distinguished by the stabilities of their respective Met-tRNAf Met-IF-1-GTP complexes to Mg-2+. The Met-tRNAf Met-IF-1A-GTP complex is distinctly more stable in the presence of Mg-2+ than Met-tRNAf Met-IF-1B-GTP complex. Continue."

https://openalex.org/W1546162123,"Hemolymph of the marine mollusc, Aplysia californica, contains four large particles: acetylcholinesterase, hemocyanin, a hemagglutinin, and a structure tentatively identified as erythrocurorin. We purified the acetylcholinesterase 20-fold by differential centrifugation and filtration through a column of 4% agarose. The freshly isolated esterase complex was found to have a sedimentation coefficient of 69, but the negatively stained enzyme lacked a definite structure in the electron microscope, and appeared as irregular aggregates of a 60 A subunit. The complex was unstable below pH 5 or during storage at 7 degrees. Under these conditions, enzymatic activity remained essentially unchanged. Treatment of the purified enzyme with trichloroacetic acid, organic solvents, and sodium dodecyl sulfate broke the complex down into two major subunits with molecular weights of about 70,000. Exposure of the enzyme to [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate resulted in the labeling of one of these subunits. Although similar in specificity, the cholinesterase of the blood differed from the enzyme in Aplysia nervous tissue, which is associated with membrane. Treatment with sodium deoxycholate activated the membrane-associated enzyme but inhibited slightly that of the hemolymph; tyrocidine inhibited the hemolymph enzyme but not the enzyme of nervous tissue; and mild digestion with trypsin released the membrane-bound enzyme in an active, soluble form, but inactivated the enzyme of hemolymph. The other particulates of Aplysia hemolymph were partially characterized. Aplysia hemocyanin was similar in structure to other molluscan hemocyanins. When negatively stained, the unit particle appeared to be a disc with a diameter of 280 A and a width of 45 A. These discs were stacked to form long cylindrical arrays. The purified hemocyanin was found to contain 0.26% copper (dry weight). Using differential centrifugation and gel filtration we also obtained a 9-fold purification of Aplysia hemagglutinin. This particle was 120 A in diameter with a dark staining central core of 40 A consisting of 6 subunits. The particle tentatively identified as erythrocurorin appeared as a structure 200 A in diameter consisting of 5 V-shaped subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1556410937,"A 70-residue analog of RNase S-protein was synthesized by the solid phase method. It was obtained by omitting the NH2 terminus from positions 21 to 25 and the segments 36 to 40, 58 to 73, 87 to 96, and 113 to 114. Four residues were inserted to link the ends formed by the deletions. Half-cystine residues that had not been part of the deletions were replaced by alanine or leucine residues. The synthetic polypeptide was separated by gel filtration into a dimer and a monomer. Both fractions were purified further by ion exchange chromatography. The dimeric 70-residue S-protein analog had a specific activity of approximately 4% using RNA as substrate. It also cleaved other substrates of RNase A such as 5'-(3'-cytidylyl)-guanosine, 5'-(3'-uridylyl)-guanosine, and polycytidylic acid. The monomer of the 70-residue analog was less active but showed the same substrate specificity as the dimer. It was found that both fractions of the synthetic S-protein analog catalyzed only the transphosphorylation step of the RNase A mechanism and had very little if any activity in the hydrolysis step. Addition of natural S-peptide or S-protein did not increase the activity in the transphosphorylation reaction but greatly enhanced the reaction rate of the hydrolysis step. IN THE PRESENCE OF S-peptide, both monomeric and dimeric 70-residue S-protein, both monomeric and dimeric 70- residue S-protein analog had approximately 8% activity using cyclic cytidine 2':3'-monophosphate as substrate. The mixtures of monomer and dimer of the synthetic S-protein analog with natural S-protein generated even higher activities (151 and 74%, respectively) against this substrate despite the fact that the NH2-terminal portion of the natural enzyme (including His 12) was missing in both components of the two complexes. The 70-residue S-protein analog was completely inactive against DNA and (with one exception) against substrates for RNase T1. The close agreement of the substrate specificity of the synthetic analog with that of native RNase A in the transphosphorylation step suggested a remarkable conservation of the configuration of the active site despite drastic changes of the primary structure of the parent molecule. Possible implications of these results for the mechanism of action of RNase A are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1551297691,"Synthesis and enzymatic modification of histone V was 1 order of magnitude lower in mature gander erythrocytes as compared with immature enriched cells hwich were capable of DNA synthesis. Application of shallow, linear gradient chromatography was used to demonstrate qualitative changes as well. This technique permitted the separation of newly synthesized and phosphorylated histone V from older, less phosphorylated molecules but did not discriminate between acetylated species. The most easily eluted fractions were those most recently synthesized, acetylated, and phosphorylated. While lysine chased into the other subfractions of histone V, phosphate did not, indicating a dephosphorylation step in the immature cells. Acetylation of histone V which occurs at a very low level was closely related to its synthesis. No differences in molecular weights or amino acid compositions were apparent, and behavior on polyacrylamide gels was similar to whole histone V. It is proposed that phosphorylation of histone V may play an important role in the modulation of the effect of histone V in immature cells on condensation and template restriction of chromatin which occurs in the terminal stages of differentiation of the avian erythroid cells."

Electrophoresis under denaturing conditions showed differences in the subunit compositions of all three purified enzymes. The properties of the enzymes from M. rouxii were similar to those of polymerases from other eukaryotic organisms. Denatured DNA was a better template than native DNA for all three enzymes but each enzyme had a distinct pattern of activities with different templates.

Enzyme II had a greater activity with Mg-2gnd was only slightly stimulated by KCl and (NH4)2SO4. None of the enzymes were inhibited by cycloheximide or by rifampicin: all were inhibited by actinomycin C and rifampin AF/018: only enzyme II was inhibited by alpha-amanitin.

https://openalex.org/W1546745100,"Binding of the guanosine nucleotides, GDP and GTP, to elongation factor 2 (EF-2) from rat liver was studied by equilibrium dialysis. It was found that the enzyme has one binding site for GDP with a dissociation constant of 4 times 10--7 M. The examination of GTP binding was difficult due to the simultaneous presence of GDP and GTP even in purified GTP preparations. This problem was further magnified by traces of GTPase in the enzyme preparation. However, by analyzing the incubation mixtures by thin layer chromatography the fraction of the total nucleotide binding to EF-2 which was due to GDP could be determined and corrected for. A GTP binding curve, corrected for GDP binding, and GTP hydrolysis extrapolated to one binding site with a dissociation constant of approximately 2 times 10--6 M. The nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, theta, gamma-methylene-guanosine-5-triphosphate, also bound to EF-2 in a 1:1 ratio. During the studies of GTP binding to EF-2 it was observed that the enzyme preparation contained a GTP-GDP transphosphorylase activity. It was initially thought that this was a novel property of EF-2, but when the activity was followed during purification of EF-2 it was whown that it was an impurity in the EF-2 preparation. ATP as well as GTP can serve as a phosphate donor in the transphosphorylation reaction; this might suggest that regeneration of GTP from GDP can take place via this pathway."

Approximately 50-fold purification was achieved by solubilization, ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sephadex G-200 and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Activities toward the above four substrates behaved essentially identically throughout the pruification procedure. Considerable differences were noted between the apparent properties determined with whole homogenate and those of the purer enzyme preparations. Based on these studies, assay procedures for the purified preparation for the three glycosphingolipid substrates were standardized. Inhibition studies with the use of varieties of simple sugars, oligosaccharide chains prepared from glycosphingolipids, and intact sphingolipids suggested that the enzyme which cleaves lactosylceramide may be different from the enzyme(s) which is active toward the other two glycosphingolipids. The oligosaccharide chains of the glycosphingolipids were much poorer inhibitors for the respective glycosphingolipid beta-galactosidases than the original intact glycosphingolipids or ceramide, and in some instances, even unrelated sphingolipids. These findings indicated the importance of the lipophilic groups and perhaps of the entire molecular configuration of glycosphingolipids in determining the specificity of these glycosphingolipid theta-galactosidases."
https://openalex.org/W1968568163,Box turtles were implanted with thermodes astride the preoptic tissue of the brainstem. The rate of evaporative water loss could be transiently increased by heating the rostral brainstem. Heating tissue in the anterior hypothalamus affected evaporative water loss only at high ambient temperatures. The magnitude of the response was proportional both to the change in hypothalamic temperature and to the ambient temperature with which the turtle was in equilibrium. The major function of a high rate of evaporative water loss in turtles is probably to protect the brain from overheating during thermal stress.

https://openalex.org/W1502322594,"The effects of ribosomes and Mg-2plus on the binding of GDP and GTP to elongation factor 2 (EF-2) have been studied by an improved filter-binding assay. Both ribosomes and Mg-2plus strongly inhibit the binding of GDP but have apparently no effect on the GTP binding to the enzyme. An apparent stimulation by ribosomes of GTP binding to EF-2 is time-dependent and parallels a concomitant increase of the GDP concentration in the incubation mixture. Based on these results and evidence obtained by other investigators it is suggested that changes in the GTP:GDP ratio associated with the elongation and termination reactions of protein synthesis cause conformational changes of the respective factors which consequently will modulate the binding and dissociation of the enzymes from ribosomes. Further evidence of the role GDP may play as a modulator of protein synthesis might possibly be provided by studies of the GTP-GDP transphosphorylase activity which is present as an impurity in highly purified preparations of EF-2 as well as in ribosome preparations. It is demonstrated that relatively high concentrations of GDP in the presence of GTP completely block the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of EF-2. Instead, the transphosphorylase enzyme(s) catalyzes an exchange reaction between GTP and GDP during which GDP remains bound to EF-2 and the relative concentrations of the two nucleotides do not change."

The rate constant for this spectral change was about 4000 s--1 at 20 degrees in 0.05 M solium borate, pH 9.3. The wavelength dependence of the amplitude of the absorbance change is similar to that observed when deoxygenated alpha and theta chains are allowed to recombine (Brunori, M., Antonini, E., Wyman, J., and Anderson, S. R. (1968) J. Mol. Biol. 34, 357-359), and therefore reflects changes in the quanternary structure of the hemoglobin tetramer induced by ligand displacement. The amplitude of this conformation-dependent spectral change was not a linear function of the fraction of bound CO removed by photolysis.

Analysis of the RNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in aqueous solutions shows that at least 95% of the RNA migrates identically with the cytoplasmic polysomal globin mRNAs. Electrophoresis in 99% formamide resolves the membrane mRNAs into two bands which migrate identically with the cytoplasmic alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs. The molar ratio of the alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs, as determined by quantitating the bands on the formamide gels, is similar to that of the cytoplasmic mRNAs. There is also no difference in biological activity between the two messenger preparations. The polyadenylic acid in the membrane mRNAs, isolated after labeling mice in vivo for 20 hours with (32P)orthophosphate, migrates with the three broad size classes previously shown to be present in the cytoplasmic globin mRNAs. The 32P specific activity of the membrane mRNAs and ribosomal RNA fractions after different times of labeling with 32Pi are similar to those from cytoplasmic polysomes. These observations show that the reticulocyte membranes contain approximately 20% of the cellular globin nRNAs, and that these mRNAs are similar to those from cytoplasmic polysomes."

https://openalex.org/W2020389572,A comprehensive study of the heavy-particle cosmic-ray exposure received by the individual astronauts during the nine lunar Apollo missions reveals a significant variation in the exposure as a function of shielding and the phase of the solar cycle. The data are useful in planning for future long-range missions and in estimating the expected biological damage.
https://openalex.org/W1482873977,Abstract The uptake into isolated HeLa nuclei of radioactive cytosol proteins and purified Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L7 is stimulated up to 4-fold by pancreatic deoxyribonuclease (DNase I). Similar effects are not observed with pancreatic ribonuclease A or phospholipase C. The results reported suggest that there is a general stimulatory effect of DNase on protein uptake by nuclei.
