https://openalex.org/W2011964019,"Algae-clay aggregates were formed when algal and clay suspensions were mixed in the presence of an electrolyte. The maximum ratio of clay to algae in the aggregates was 1.7, 0.2, and 0.03 milligrams of clay per milligram of algae (wet weight) for Anabaena, Chlamydomonas, and Chlorella sp., respectively. The aggregates formed at Ca2+ concentrations higher than 5 × 10–4M or Na+ concentrations higher than 2 × 10–2M. The mutualf flocculation and subsequent sedimentation have many practical and ecological implications for bodies of water."
https://openalex.org/W2031576181,Surgical removal of the optic lobes of the cockroach Leucophaea maderae followed by transplantation of the optic lobes from another individual led to a restoration of the circadian activity rhythm in 4 to 8 weeks. The free-running period of the restored rhythm was determined by the period of the donor rhythm before surgery. The results suggest that the transplanted optic lobe contains a circadian clock that regenerates those neural connections with the host brain that are necessary to drive the circadian rhythm of activity.
https://openalex.org/W2026371595,"It may be possible to determine the boron-8 solar neutrino flux, averaged over the past several million years, from the concentration of technetium-98 in molybdenite. The mass spectrometry of this system is greatly simplified by the absence of stable technetium isotopes, and the presence of the fission product technetium-99 provides a monitor of uiranium-induced backgrounds. This geochemical experiment could provide the first test of nonstandard solar models that suggest a relation between the chlorine-37 solar neutrino puzzle and the recent ice age."

https://openalex.org/W1985365426,"Several papers have recorded the stimulation by 1,2,5,6-dibenzanthracene of the growth of a variety of organisms, such as Obelia (1), Escherichia communior (2), planaria (3), and Fusarium lini (4). The hydrocarbon has also been found to depress the respiration of brain, spleen, and liver (5). In view of the fact that cancer tissue is generally characterized by rapid growth and deficient respiration, these findings are significant, and it is surprising that so few attempts have been made to correlate the two types of action on simple organisms. In an earlier note (6) we called attention to the effect of 1,2,5,6-dibenzanthracene on the growth and respiration of yeast, and subsequently Wright and Anderson (4) showed that a soluble oxidation product of the hydrocarbon not only stimulates the growth of Fusarium lini , as indicated by dry weight determinations, but also causes a more rapid utilization of glucose. Pourbaix (7) observed that another carcinogenic agent, styryl 430, depresses the oxygen consumption of yeast and decreases alcohol formation by interfering with the phosphorylation mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2006112545,"Models for fundamental physical interactions allow for the existence of stable or nearly stable elementary particles much heavier than the proton. Stellar spectra were searched for a positively charged superheavy particle, X+, which, with a bound electron, should appear as apparently superheavy neutral hydrogen in the interstellar medium. An upper limit for the abundance of X relative to normal hydrogen in the line of sight toward the bright star γ Cassiopeiae is 2 ""×"" (multiplication sign) with ""×"" 10–8."
